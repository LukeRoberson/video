00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:28.940
We extend a warm welcome to all of you to the December 2019 edition of J.W. Broadcasting.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:35.840
The Watchtower Bible School of Gilead began on February 1, 1943.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:43.840
Since then, thousands of students have benefited from the school's in-depth course of Bible study.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.840
After months of intense study, graduation day is a highlight for the class.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:59.840
In this month's program, you'll enjoy part one of the graduation of the 147th class of Gilead.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:11.340
Pay close attention to these encouraging scriptural talks delivered to the graduates on Saturday, September 14, 2019.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.840
Well, this is a very happy day for those who are very soon to graduate from this 147th class of Gilead.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:27.840
I wanted to begin by asking them a question, and that is, how far will you go?

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.840
When people ask that question, how far will you go?

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.840
Normally, in connection with secular education, the meaning of the question is,

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.340
are you going to get your bachelor's degree, are you going to go for your master's,

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.340
are you going to go for a PhD and get your doctorate?

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:57.340
And so, in that sense, often going far in secular education is solely a means of self-fulfillment

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.840
and not necessarily to help others.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.840
Some study what's called pure science.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:11.340
Just to advance mankind's understanding of science, but with no practical benefit.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:20.340
Some study dead languages. Some study bacteria or insects, which is wonderful if you like insects.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.840
It may increase knowledge, but it doesn't necessarily help anyone.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.840
Well, divine education is so different.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:39.840
You see, it motivates us to ask the question, how far can I go not to further myself,

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.840
but to help others?

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.340
Now, Jehovah God and Christ Jesus really set the example for us here.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:54.580
Would you join me? Let's read together Psalm 113.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.580
And let's look at here at verse 6, speaking of our wonderful God, Jehovah.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:08.580
It says, he stoops down to look on heaven and earth.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.080
Well, now, how high do you imagine Jehovah to be?

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.080
Well, no matter how high you imagine it, you know, it's still higher.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.080
Jehovah is so high as the Almighty God.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.580
But what does it say here in verse 6? He stoops down.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:34.580
Well, just think. You might think of an illustration of a man who is perhaps very, very tall,

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.580
and he's talking to a very, very small child. What does he do?

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:47.580
Oftentimes, he might crouch down, get down on one knee, and get right down on to the level of the child to speak to him.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.580
And as a result, how does the little child feel?

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:56.580
Well, not so afraid, not so intimidated by that large man.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.580
The child becomes calm. Well, think about Jehovah.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:13.580
How far has Jehovah gone to stoop down so that we feel loved, so that we feel valued, so that we feel appreciated?

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:23.579
What a beautiful example, Jehovah sets, in going far to make us feel so comfortable with him.

00:04:24.579 --> 00:04:30.579
Now, what about our Lord Jesus? Well, think how far he went to help each one of us.

00:04:30.579 --> 00:04:33.579
Just look at the scripture here in Philippians 2.

00:04:33.579 --> 00:04:44.300
Philippians 2 says that Jesus, of course, came from heaven, didn't he? Can you imagine how far that is?

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:50.300
It says in verse 5, keep this mental attitude in you that was also in Christ Jesus,

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.300
who although he was existing in God's form, gave no consideration to a seizure,

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:01.300
namely that he should be equal to God, no, but he emptied himself, and what did he do?

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.300
He took a slave's form, and he became human.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.300
Well, that was pretty far to go.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:17.300
And while you and I think the earth is pretty amazing and pretty wonderful, have you ever seen heaven?

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:24.300
And that's where Jesus left willingly to come down to be among us, to serve us.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.300
And then in the end, how far did he go? Well, what does verse 8 say?

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:36.300
More than that, when he came as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to what?

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:42.300
To the point of death. Yes, death on a torture stake.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:50.300
Jesus was willing to go very, very far to help people.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:56.300
Well, now you have all come to Gilead. Why did you come to Gilead? What was the purpose of it?

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.300
You see, was it to increase your Bible knowledge?

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:10.300
Was it to give you some grand knowledge of Bible history or to give you some comprehensive knowledge of biblical Greek or Hebrew?

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:21.300
No. The purpose of your coming to Gilead was to help you so that you could strengthen and stabilize the field and branch territory.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:28.300
That's the purpose of Gilead. But now, what is the field and the branch territory? What is that?

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:34.300
It's people. It's people that need to be loved. It's people that need to be organized.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:48.300
People that need to be trained and helped. And at Gilead, you have learned what Colossians chapter 4 and verse 11 says to be a source of great comfort.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:54.300
Or, as the footnote says, to be a strengthening aid to other people.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:01.300
Well, now the question is, that sits before you now is, how far will you go?

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:08.300
How far will you go to be fathers and mothers, to be brothers and sisters to all of these ones?

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:14.300
There has never been such a great need for this type of help.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:21.300
We have known the world more of our brothers facing persecution than we have ever seen.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.300
And we expect that that is going to increase.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:35.300
In some lands, we have lawlessness on a level previously unheard of, where kidnapping and rampant violence occurs on a daily basis.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:44.300
And many of our brothers are facing anxieties and pressures that they have never ever had to experience before.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:52.300
They need your help. They need to be strengthened and comforted by you.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:08:04.300
Well, sometimes you're going to feel overwhelmed. Sometimes you're going to wonder, what should I do? And you won't know exactly what to do.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:11.300
Sometimes, even your best efforts, working very, very hard, won't work out the way that you want them to.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:19.300
But remember that the brothers and sisters that you're working with, the people that you're trying to help, are wonderful people.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:24.300
And they will work with you, and they will support you.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:31.300
But most of all, are wonderful and amazing God. Jehovah will be there to support you.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:36.299
Here's an experience that I just heard that really brought this to my mind and strengthened it.

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:39.299
It comes from Abaco in the Bahamas.

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:46.299
Now, you remember just about a week ago, we had this terrible Hurricane Dorian that struck this part of the world.

00:08:46.299 --> 00:08:54.299
The Disaster Relief Committee in the Bahamas was working very hard to evacuate our brothers from Abaco Island to NASA.

00:08:54.299 --> 00:09:00.299
Now, they had an airplane, worked very hard to have an airplane ready to go in the evening.

00:09:00.299 --> 00:09:13.299
And although almost all communication had been cut off with Abaco Island, they sent a message on all possible channels for the brothers in Abaco to make their way to the air strip.

00:09:13.299 --> 00:09:24.299
Now, as they were loading the plane with all the necessary materials, they were told that the government would not grant permission for the plane to land that day.

00:09:24.299 --> 00:09:32.299
Now, the brothers tried everything. They persisted, but the government authorities would not budge. Can you imagine how they felt?

00:09:32.299 --> 00:09:43.299
But an hour or so later, much to their surprise, they heard reports that 14 brothers and sisters from Abaco would be landing soon in NASA.

00:09:43.299 --> 00:09:46.299
And they wondered, how could this be possible?

00:09:46.299 --> 00:09:57.299
Well, they made preparations immediately at the NASA assembly hall and 14 exhausted hungry brothers and sisters arrived who had just been evacuated.

00:09:57.299 --> 00:10:06.299
There was a congregation meeting just ending at the assembly hall. The brothers all went out greeting them, singing our new song, unfailing love.

00:10:06.299 --> 00:10:10.299
Can you imagine what the scene must have been there at NASA?

00:10:10.299 --> 00:10:20.299
But of course, a question was, how could this have happened? Well, the brothers explained, we heard the message to go to the air strip so we made our journey there.

00:10:20.299 --> 00:10:25.299
A plane arrived, and we thought it was the brothers.

00:10:25.299 --> 00:10:34.299
But it was a company who had a plane circling the island. When they saw a group of people at the air strip, they landed and evacuated us.

00:10:34.299 --> 00:10:42.299
Everyone was in tears. 14 of the brothers got the message. They followed the direction. They assembled to be rescued.

00:10:42.299 --> 00:10:49.299
And the disaster relief committee said, Jehovah made sure that his people were evacuated to safety. Isn't that wonderful?

00:10:49.299 --> 00:11:09.360
So, even when you're best, doesn't seem to be good enough. Jehovah will make up for it. Do your best, and Jehovah will do the rest.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:20.360
If you have love for God, and you have love for your brothers in your heart, how far will you go? You will go very, very far.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:27.360
Well, we're looking forward now to our first talk from a member of the governing body, our dear brother Samuel Heard.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:36.360
And he is going to give us a very fine warning. His talk is entitled, Be careful. Knowledge puffs up.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:12:05.210
I'm looking at you. I'm looking at you too. But you have something that I can't see. It's in your head and in your heart.

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:20.210
It's knowledge. You've been cramming now for five months, stuffing things into that brain, and allowing it through meditation to trickle down into your heart.

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:31.210
So you may feel that you have enough. I can't get any more into the brain, but we know better.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:40.210
There's still room for you to put a little more knowledge into the brain, and you're going to do that.

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:58.000
But you may feel right now that you are ready to explode. Don't you do it? But here's something to think about. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Now, that's a scripture found in 1 Corinthians chapter 8 and verse 1. Now, it doesn't have to be this way, especially with divine knowledge.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:27.000
The knowledge that you receive from Jehovah, it's not designed to puff you up and to make you feel better than your neighbors, your brothers and your sisters, who may not have the amount of knowledge and education that you have and what you have just now received.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:38.000
No, that's not the purpose of the knowledge that you have acquired here in the Gilead school, but there is something we have to think about.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:56.000
What is that? Well, let's open our Bibles. Let's open our Bibles to 2 Peter, and let's take a look at what is stated here in 2 Peter, the first chapter, verses 5 and 6.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:15.000
He says, for this very reason, put forth all earnest effort to supply to your faith virtue, to your virtue knowledge, to your knowledge self-control, to your self-control endurance, to your endurance godly devotion.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:30.000
You see what you must apply to your knowledge self-control. We can't allow our mouths to just run wild with the information that we've received just spreading it everywhere.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:47.000
It doesn't matter to whom it may receive it, but you have to control how much knowledge you permit to flow out of your mouth at a given time. Self-control is needed.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:57.000
That means we should not boast over our accomplishments. All glory must go to Jehovah God and not to ourselves.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:08.000
It's easy for others to feel that we are putting them down a little bit because of the vast knowledge that we have.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:22.000
So we had to be careful and controlled and not boast. It reminded me of a story of Fable I heard years ago about a little flea by the name of Herman.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Herman and Flea got on the back of a giant elephant, and he rode on that elephant across her rickety bridge, and the bridge just shook as if it was going to explode and fall apart.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:56.000
But they made it to the other side. And when they made it to the other side, and the flea left the elephant and found his friends, he bragged about what he was able to do along with the elephant in making that bridge shake as they crossed it.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Now how much do you feel that that flea contributed to the shaking of that bridge? Now what we're going to do though, we're going to leave the Fable and we're going to go to the Bible.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Let's go to the Bible and we're going to trade that flea in for a grasshopper. Now here it is.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Isaiah, chapter 40, verse 22. Take a look at it. There is one who dwells above the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:36.000
He is stretching out the heavens like a fine gauze, and he spreads them out like a tent to dwell in.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Now what we can do, we can apply this to ourselves. Now of course in the scripture contact, Joho was really not talking about his people as grasshoppers, but people with worldly knowledge that they've acquired.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:15.000
They are like grasshoppers as far as Jehovah is concerned. You see the whole context of what he's talking about, but we're going to apply it to ourselves because we're so small in the eyes of Jehovah that we can be just like a grasshopper on the back of a giant elephant.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:29.000
And our accomplishments that we make are not of our own abilities, but it's because of the help that we have coming from heaven, Jehovah.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:36.000
And we find that the Apostle Paul said a fine example and not being a braggar.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:54.000
What did he have? Well he had so much knowledge. In fact, when known as the man Saul of Tarsus, he was highly educated and was a Pharisee, and that was viewed as an impeccable Jewish pedigree, that's this man had.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:12.000
But when he wrote letters, he didn't glorify himself. For instance, take a look at 1 Corinthians chapter 2, and read along with me verses 1 through 5, and you'll find that he did not allow knowledge to puff him up.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:21.000
This is outreach. So when I came to you, brothers, I did not come with a Stravagan speech or wisdom declaring the sacred secret of God to you.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:41.000
For I decided not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and him executed on the state. And I came to you in weakness and in fear and with much trembling and my speech and what I preached were not with persuasive words of wisdom, but with a demonstration of spirit and power.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:51.000
So that your faith might be not in men's wisdom, but in God's power. There's an example.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Let's try our best to follow that example and not be like men and women of the world who attend these great universities and they come out and they're able to get doctors degrees in science or this or that.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:22.000
And they kind of show all that off, but we're not like that. But we could be if we're not careful. Now the Bible shows what worldly wisdom can accomplish and what it cannot accomplish.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:43.000
For instance, in Ecclesiastes chapter 1, verses 16 to 18, the account starts off this way it says, then I said in my heart, look, I have acquired great wisdom more than anyone who was before me in Jerusalem and my heart gained a great deal of wisdom and knowledge.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:20:04.000
It goes on, I applied my heart to knowing wisdom and to knowing madness and knowing folly. And this too is a chasing after the wind for an abundance of wisdom brings an abundance of frustration so that whoever increases knowledge increases pain.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Now if you got a little whiff of that, know it all, then blow it away. Move away from it. You don't want to think that way.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Let's never try to be a know it all. Jesus doesn't know everything that he has been learning from Jehovah for eons of time. Now how long is an eon?

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:41.000
An eon is a really, really super long, impossible to a major length of time. That's an eon. Only Jehovah knows everything.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:56.000
Keep that in mind. There is nothing beyond his understanding. How do we know that? Well, the Bible tells us that same chapter where he mentions the Grasshopper, Isaiah chapter 40, but this time 13 and 14,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:14.000
says, who has taken the measurements of the spirit of Jehovah and who can instruct him as an advisor with whom did he consult to gain understanding or who teaches him in the path of justice or teaches him knowledge or shows him the way of true understanding?

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:43.509
Think about it. We can know what we need to know at the time we need to know it. Now that's a mouthful. Or should we say a headful? Yes, all of you graduates of Gilead School, please share with others what you've learned here at Gilead School.

00:21:43.509 --> 00:21:54.509
Don't walk away from this top thinking you should keep your mouths closed. We're not saying that, but control what you say and when you say it and to whom you tell it to.

00:21:54.509 --> 00:22:14.079
So we know that you've learned so much at this school, but share it discreetly. Keep in mind these words of King Solomon. He says there is an appointed time for everything, a time to be silent and a time to speak.

00:22:14.079 --> 00:22:35.079
Don't point to yourself. Point heavenward. Always glorify Jehovah. Point to Jehovah. Now, government and body members, all of us, we have to be very careful ourselves because we get credit for things that we are not responsible for.

00:22:35.079 --> 00:22:49.420
Brothers, account my hug you. Oh, thank you, brothers, you government body members. You're really well. Now, we know we didn't do anything.

00:22:49.420 --> 00:23:05.440
You could have done what we did if you'd been in our seat. It's Jehovah spirit that causes these things to happen. Now it's true we're tools that he uses, but he's the one.

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:20.440
Now, we're not saying that you can't say thank you, brother, for what you're doing the work that you do. No, we're not saying that. It's just be careful that you're not glorify men, but glorify God.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:35.440
The governing body gets credit that we don't deserve. It belongs to Jehovah and Jesus and we haven't been able to close the mouths of over 8 million bleeding sheep, but we will keep trying.

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:56.559
So in conclusion, be like the grasshopper that wrote on the back of the elephant, stay close to Jehovah and enjoy the ride, but always give him their credit for your accomplishment.

00:23:56.559 --> 00:24:22.299
Oh, we thank you so much brotherhood for that excellent warning for us. Of course, the one day I mentioned insects in my introduction, brotherhood uses insects in his talk. I guess we do need to know about insects.

00:24:23.299 --> 00:24:37.299
Well, now we're looking forward to hearing from a helper to the service committee of the governing body, brother Christopher Maver, and brother Maver is going to speak to us on the topic, count your days.

00:24:37.299 --> 00:24:55.299
Isn't it true? We often count our days when we anticipate an exciting event and no doubt you, Gillia's students, you were counting your days in anticipation of this day, and if you were, you know that today is the 138th day of your Gillia's school experience.

00:24:56.299 --> 00:25:12.299
But after today, will you continue to count your days? Should you? To answer that question, please open your Bibles to the 90th song and it's a prayer that Moses said to Jehovah and notice what Moses asked him in verse 12.

00:25:13.299 --> 00:25:21.299
Teach us how to count our days so that we may acquire a heart of wisdom.

00:25:22.299 --> 00:25:34.299
So the answer to this question is yes, we should continue to count our days, but what does that mean? Count your days and why will we need God's help to do it?

00:25:35.299 --> 00:25:49.299
The answer is this, because we are dedicated servants of Jehovah God. Each and every day we need to make sure that we are using it in his service to bring him glory.

00:25:49.299 --> 00:26:01.299
Now, we're imperfect. This is not always easy to do. In fact, if we look at verse 10 of the 90th song, we notice that Moses said that our days are few and they are filled with a lot of difficulties.

00:26:02.299 --> 00:26:11.299
So we need God's help to fulfill our dedication. Yes, we need to count our days and Jehovah promises that he will be there to help us.

00:26:11.299 --> 00:26:15.299
Notice this promise in Isaiah chapter 30.

00:26:16.299 --> 00:26:25.740
In verse 21, Jehovah says, and your own ears will hear a word behind you saying, this is the way. Walk in it.

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:35.740
In case you should go to the right or in case you should go to the left. So the reality is we need Jehovah to help us to live a dedicated life to him.

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:42.740
Thankfully, we don't need to figure it out on our own. He's there to guide and direct us. But did you know what he expects of us?

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:51.740
Looking back at that scripture, he says, when he tells you something, walk in it. That's an emphatic statement, isn't it?

00:26:52.740 --> 00:27:01.740
It doesn't leave any doubt. We need to do it. Make it happen in our life. We cannot be passive about our dedication.

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:13.740
As Christians, we leave a very busy life. We have various events to go to. And especially if you're in full-time service, well, you are given an assignment and oftentimes, that assignment is spelled out for you.

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:19.740
Even the schedule in which to accomplish that work is set for us. We don't really think too much about it.

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:33.740
Now, if we're not careful, we could just carry it along with the flow of time, the flow of the work, and not remember why we are doing it and who we are doing it for.

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:44.740
In fact, we could become like this fine young brother on a raft. He is enjoying himself. He's going with the flow of the time. But is he really mindful of where he is going and why?

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:52.740
He's sitting down. He's looking all around. The or is not in a hand. He's not actively steering his life. He's passive.

00:27:53.740 --> 00:28:05.740
Now, being passive in our dedication to Jehovah is a very dangerous situation because as Ecclesiastes 9-11 tells us, time and unexpected events overtake us.

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:11.740
Now, this fine brother is about to get a rude awakening. An unexpected rock has popped up.

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:23.740
A sudden storm of difficulties has overtaken him because he was passive. He was caught off guard. He lost his balance. Now he's suffering spiritual shipwreck.

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:35.740
He did not count his days. He forgot to listen to Jehovah God to pay attention to his dedication in his life. He wasn't listening.

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:42.740
Jesus emphasized that it's so important for us not to be passive about our dedication to God.

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:56.740
Luke 1324, Jesus made it clear that we were to exert ourselves vigorously, not just at a work assignment, but in our life as a Christian.

00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:07.740
Be personally involved in what we are doing in our Christian dedication. The Apostle Paul also gave good counsel to the young man Timothy that we benefit from today.

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:15.740
First Timothy 47, you'll recall that Paul says, train yourself with godly devotion as your aim.

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:24.180
Now, when we're training ourselves, that means we're not finished yet. We're still in the competition. We're still in training.

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:35.180
Godly devotion must be something that we personally take for ourselves and work at it. It just doesn't happen on its own.

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:48.180
But thankfully, Jehovah helps us. He's given us his word, the Bible. He's given us his organization which helps us apply Bible principles in our life and gives us warnings on the things to look out for.

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:58.180
It's up to us to do it. It's as if Jehovah gives us the ore and he says, now pick it up and use it in your stream of time.

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:13.180
And when we do, then we're like this young brother now. He's taken a firm hold on the ore. He's using it even during peaceful times in his life, making sure that his life is continuing on in a faithful Christian course.

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:20.180
Then when he encounters temptations or trials, well, he's got his oren his hand.

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:26.180
Jehovah is there to help him, to guide and direct him, to navigate through the difficult times.

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:40.180
It takes effort. It can be distressing. But, Jehovah has given us the means to navigate through these difficult times to continue on pursuing our dedicated Christian life.

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:53.809
Jesus said the perfect example in this. Every day, Jesus relied heavily on Jehovah's direction. He did not take it for granted.

00:30:54.809 --> 00:31:08.809
But, Jesus knew, when he was sent to the earth, he had an assignment. He was on a very strict time budget. It was humanly impossible really for a man, even a perfect man, to accomplish what Jesus did.

00:31:09.809 --> 00:31:21.809
He relied on Jehovah. He did not take a casual viewpoint of it. But every day, he looked at Jehovah to help him to apply the principles of that he learned through his word.

00:31:22.809 --> 00:31:33.809
The direction that he received from Jehovah God and going through this difficult assignment. And Jesus knew, at the end of the day, after the things he preached and the things he did, he knew that that was a miracle.

00:31:34.809 --> 00:31:51.809
He said so, John 1410. He says, the father who remains in union with me is doing his works. He knew, Jehovah was backing him up. But, Jesus worked with Jehovah. He didn't take a casual view of it.

00:31:52.809 --> 00:32:03.809
Now, we can have the same kind of confidence in Jehovah. He is there for us, even when we are encountering something that we feel is humanly impossible.

00:32:04.809 --> 00:32:10.809
We have a good example of that. There is a couple who graduated in the 24th class of Gilead.

00:32:11.809 --> 00:32:19.809
The names are Malcolm and Grace Allen. Now, their life story is in the October 15th, 2013 Watchtower, and it's really worthwhile reading.

00:32:20.809 --> 00:32:31.809
But we will find that in their early life, they both pioneered. They got married. They pioneered together. They were in the circuit work for a number of years. They were invited to Gilead and after Gilead, they were assigned to Brooklyn Bethel.

00:32:32.809 --> 00:32:40.809
And their brother, Allen, served in some very responsible positions and his wife, a housekeeper. They loved their Bethel service.

00:32:41.809 --> 00:32:49.809
But 25 years into their Bethel career, their course in life took a sudden change, a detour, unexpected.

00:32:50.809 --> 00:33:01.809
Both sets of parents became very ill and needy. And it became apparent that they would have to relinquish their Bethel service and full time service in order to care for them.

00:33:02.809 --> 00:33:14.809
Now, mind you, at this point in their life, they are both in their late 50s. They used their youth and service to God, so brother Allen did not have really a secular career or skill on which to go back to.

00:33:15.809 --> 00:33:21.809
He needed to start in his late 50s to be the breadwinner of the family.

00:33:22.809 --> 00:33:29.809
Sister Allen now needed to take care of both sets of parents. This was a sharp change in events for them.

00:33:30.809 --> 00:33:40.809
But they held firm to their or that Jehovah God had given them. They learned to rely on Jehovah God to lean on him every inch of the way.

00:33:40.809 --> 00:33:45.809
And they were successful. Brother Allen found a job as an insurance salesman which provided for the family.

00:33:46.809 --> 00:33:55.809
And they kept going. Even though it was stressful times, they were successful. Now eventually, their parents died and they thought, well, maybe we can return to Bethel service.

00:33:56.809 --> 00:34:07.809
But unfortunately, at this point in their life, their own health and age overtook them. And they only had to content themselves with being good local congregation publishers.

00:34:08.809 --> 00:34:17.809
How did they view this? Was this a view of failure on their part? Did they think I failed or I'm bitter or because things happened?

00:34:18.809 --> 00:34:25.809
Where brother Allen makes this very profound statement about life in Jehovah's service.

00:34:26.809 --> 00:34:33.809
This is what he says. Life is unpredictable at times uncertain and even hard to deal with.

00:34:34.809 --> 00:34:45.809
But Jehovah blesses those who lean on him, not on their own understanding. This is what my wife and I have experienced over our long and rewarding life.

00:34:46.809 --> 00:35:01.809
They rejoiced in their life of a dedicated servant of God, taking advantage of every opportunity to express their dedication to him and pursuing and practicing godly devotion in their life.

00:35:01.809 --> 00:35:12.809
And they saw Jehovah's hand in their life in truly miraculous ways. Now they will experience another miracle of God because both of them are now sleeping in the grave.

00:35:13.809 --> 00:35:27.809
But we know that Jehovah has already calculated the days when he will resurrect Malcolm and Grace and bring them back to life so they can continue serving him in a dedicated way for an eternity of days to come.

00:35:28.809 --> 00:35:37.809
This is certainly a good lesson for all of us to count our days, to be fully invested in our journey as a dedicated Christian to Jehovah.

00:35:38.809 --> 00:35:52.809
Therefore, you Gilead students and really all of us, let us continue to lean on Jehovah and working vigorously at doing what Jehovah directs us to do during these difficult last days, living up to our dedication to God.

00:35:53.809 --> 00:36:05.809
And doing so, we can be assured that we too will be blessed by Jehovah. He will give us an eternity of days to enjoy in his glorious new world soon to come.

00:36:16.889 --> 00:36:20.889
Well, we thank you very much, Brother Maver, for that very good reminder.

00:36:20.889 --> 00:36:34.889
Well, now we have the privilege to hear from one of our more recently appointed helpers to the governing body, Brother Leonard Myers, I help her to the writing committee. He is going to speak to us on the topic, you trusted in me.

00:36:37.619 --> 00:36:44.619
You trusted in me. Now you may be saying, Brother Myers, I don't even know you. How can I trust in you?

00:36:45.619 --> 00:36:57.619
And it's true that we need to have a relationship with an individual to truly trust him. But the me and our talk title isn't referring to any human, referring to our trustworthy God, Jehovah.

00:36:58.619 --> 00:37:09.619
And that phrase you trusted in me was stated by Jehovah to the faithful man, Ebid Melek. Why could Jehovah tell him that? And how can his example help you students?

00:37:10.619 --> 00:37:19.619
Well, turn with me, please to Jeremiah chapter 38. And as we review his example, look for ways that Ebid Melek trusted in Jehovah.

00:37:20.619 --> 00:37:28.619
Now, as you know, Ebid Melek was an Ethiopian eunuch employed in the house of King Zedekaya, and he was a friend of the prophet Jeremiah.

00:37:29.619 --> 00:37:36.619
At the time, Jerusalem was under siege by the Babylonians, and Jeremiah had repeatedly declared that the city was doomed.

00:37:36.619 --> 00:37:45.619
He had encouraged the people to save themselves by surrendering. Now that enraged certain princes who were Zedekaya's advisors.

00:37:46.619 --> 00:37:52.619
They were determined to defend the city at all costs, and Jeremiah was an obstacle to that defense.

00:37:53.619 --> 00:38:03.619
Well, if you look in verse 4 of Jeremiah chapter 38, the princes went to Zedekaya and they accused Jeremiah of weakening the morale of the soldiers and all the people.

00:38:04.619 --> 00:38:14.619
Weak King that he was, Zedekaya stated in verse 5, look, he is in your hands for the King cannot do anything to stop you.

00:38:15.619 --> 00:38:22.619
Well, we know what that resulted in. Those princes had Jeremiah lowered into a myriad muddy system.

00:38:23.619 --> 00:38:30.619
With the food supply being virtually exhausted in Jerusalem, there was no hope of Jeremiah receiving food from anyone.

00:38:31.619 --> 00:38:34.619
His death was just a matter of time.

00:38:35.619 --> 00:38:41.619
Well, in step, Ebed Melek, he heard what those princes had done and trusting in Jehovah.

00:38:42.619 --> 00:38:50.619
He approached the King not privately, not secretly, but in public, at one of the city gates, and noticed what he stated in verse 9.

00:38:51.619 --> 00:38:56.619
Oh, my Lord, the King, what these men have done to Jeremiah, the Prophet is evil.

00:38:57.619 --> 00:39:04.619
They have thrown him into the sister, and he will die there because of the famine, for there is no bread left in the city.

00:39:05.619 --> 00:39:11.619
And the result of his bold action and trust in Jehovah, the King stated in verse 10,

00:39:12.619 --> 00:39:20.619
Take 30 men with you from here, and pull Jeremiah the Prophet up out of the sister before he dies.

00:39:21.619 --> 00:39:24.619
Now, 30 men certainly would have served as a protection.

00:39:25.619 --> 00:39:37.619
Yet, Ebed Melek may still have feared what those princes would do to him, but his concern was outweighed by his friendship and respect for Jehovah's Prophet and by his trust in Jehovah.

00:39:38.619 --> 00:39:43.619
And as we know, verses 11 through 13 outline, his successful rescue mission.

00:39:44.619 --> 00:39:51.619
But why could Ebed Melek be so courageous when he approached the King and rescued Jeremiah?

00:39:52.619 --> 00:39:54.619
It was because he trusted in Jehovah.

00:39:55.619 --> 00:39:58.619
And because of that trust, notice how Jehovah would reward him.

00:39:58.619 --> 00:40:02.619
In chapter 39, we'll start reading in the B portion of verse 16.

00:40:03.619 --> 00:40:06.619
Notice Jehovah's words through Jeremiah to Ebed Melek.

00:40:08.619 --> 00:40:12.619
Here I am fulfilling my words on this city for calamity and not for good.

00:40:12.619 --> 00:40:16.619
And in that day, you will see it happen.

00:40:16.619 --> 00:40:22.619
But I will rescue you in that day declares Jehovah and you will not be handed over to the men you fear.

00:40:22.619 --> 00:40:27.619
For I will surely provide you with escape and you will not fall by the sword.

00:40:27.619 --> 00:40:33.619
You will have your life as a spoil because you trusted in me.

00:40:34.619 --> 00:40:36.619
Ebed Melek didn't need to fear.

00:40:36.619 --> 00:40:39.619
As he had viewed Jeremiah's life as precious,

00:40:39.619 --> 00:40:44.619
so Jehovah viewed his life as precious and would preserve him alive.

00:40:44.619 --> 00:40:49.619
All because, as verse 18 says, he trusted in Jehovah.

00:40:50.619 --> 00:40:55.619
Now, whether he was deported to Babylon and died a natural death or was left back in the land of Judah,

00:40:55.619 --> 00:40:59.619
the Bible doesn't say, but his life would be spared

00:40:59.619 --> 00:41:04.619
and he could continue to worship the God in whom he trusted.

00:41:04.619 --> 00:41:08.619
At this point, Ebed Melek vanishes from Bible history,

00:41:08.619 --> 00:41:16.619
but not his name nor the example that he set for you and me to trust in Jehovah.

00:41:16.619 --> 00:41:20.619
Now, this thought of trusting in Jehovah isn't new to you students.

00:41:20.619 --> 00:41:23.619
Trusting in Jehovah got you to Gillian.

00:41:23.619 --> 00:41:28.619
In your assignments at Bethel or the field, you proved your trust in God.

00:41:29.619 --> 00:41:32.619
Trust helped you through your studies at Gillian.

00:41:32.619 --> 00:41:37.619
Do you remember the times when you prayed for Jehovah's help with an assignment or a test

00:41:37.619 --> 00:41:39.619
or as one recent graduate said,

00:41:39.619 --> 00:41:44.619
when your brain was full and you needed a full week off to digest all the material?

00:41:44.619 --> 00:41:46.619
Remember those times?

00:41:46.619 --> 00:41:49.619
See, that took trust that Jehovah would help you.

00:41:49.619 --> 00:41:56.619
And as you look to the future, trusting in Jehovah will help you to be successful in your assignments.

00:41:56.619 --> 00:42:00.619
Notice these comments from graduates of the last class of Gillian.

00:42:00.619 --> 00:42:02.619
One brother wrote,

00:42:02.619 --> 00:42:05.619
we have placed our lives in Jehovah's hands.

00:42:05.619 --> 00:42:12.619
We prayed to Jehovah with an intensity and trust that never existed before.

00:42:12.619 --> 00:42:14.619
Another brother wrote,

00:42:14.619 --> 00:42:18.619
at times I have felt like, what do we do?

00:42:18.619 --> 00:42:22.619
That I'm reminded that we confidently leave the matter in Jehovah's hands

00:42:22.619 --> 00:42:28.619
trusting that he will handle it or make clear to us the course to take.

00:42:28.619 --> 00:42:31.619
And finally, another brother wrote,

00:42:31.619 --> 00:42:38.619
at times we have felt quite overwhelmed with the new language, responsibilities, culture, and so forth.

00:42:38.619 --> 00:42:46.619
However, our trust in Jehovah reminds us that this is his organization, his work, and they are his sheep.

00:42:46.619 --> 00:42:51.619
If we do our part and work hard, there is no doubt he'll help us.

00:42:51.619 --> 00:42:55.619
We never have to rely on ourselves.

00:42:55.619 --> 00:42:57.619
Like Ebid Melek,

00:42:57.619 --> 00:43:03.619
trusting in Jehovah will help you to be successful in your assignments.

00:43:03.619 --> 00:43:07.619
Here are two ways that you can add to your trust.

00:43:07.619 --> 00:43:15.619
Number one, trusting in Jehovah involves trusting in the power of Holy Spirit.

00:43:15.619 --> 00:43:21.619
For example, trusting in that Spirit will help you to deal with your brothers and sisters.

00:43:21.619 --> 00:43:25.619
Now, your assignments will involve close contact with them.

00:43:25.619 --> 00:43:30.619
Will there be challenges at times? Very likely, we're all imperfect.

00:43:30.619 --> 00:43:35.619
Trust that Holy Spirit can help you to cultivate the love, peace, patience,

00:43:35.619 --> 00:43:41.619
mildness, and self-control that you'll need to deal with those situations.

00:43:41.619 --> 00:43:49.619
Number two, trusting in Jehovah means trusting those whom he trusts.

00:43:49.619 --> 00:43:55.619
Jehovah is a range for the faithful and the great slave to care for earthly kingdom interests.

00:43:55.619 --> 00:43:58.619
Trust in the appointment of the slave.

00:43:58.619 --> 00:44:03.619
Trust in Jehovah's arrangement, follow any direction that the slave provides.

00:44:03.619 --> 00:44:08.619
Those are two ways that you can add to your trust in Jehovah.

00:44:08.619 --> 00:44:13.619
We encourage you to trust in Jehovah especially when you face challenging situations.

00:44:13.619 --> 00:44:17.619
During those times, remember scriptures such as these.

00:44:17.619 --> 00:44:20.619
Proverbs chapter 3 verse 5.

00:44:20.619 --> 00:44:26.619
Trust in Jehovah with all your heart and do not rely on your own understanding.

00:44:26.619 --> 00:44:31.619
Psalm 56 verses 3 and 4.

00:44:31.619 --> 00:44:41.619
When I am afraid, I put my trust in you, in God whose word I praise, in God, I put my trust.

00:44:41.619 --> 00:44:45.619
And Isaiah chapter 26 verses 3 and 4.

00:44:45.619 --> 00:44:48.619
You will safeguard those who fully lean on you.

00:44:48.619 --> 00:44:53.619
You will give them continuous peace because it is in you that they trust.

00:44:53.619 --> 00:44:57.619
Trust in Jehovah forever.

00:44:57.619 --> 00:45:02.619
Scriptures like those can really help you during challenging times.

00:45:02.619 --> 00:45:05.619
Trust got you here to Gilead.

00:45:05.619 --> 00:45:07.619
Trust helped you through your studies.

00:45:07.619 --> 00:45:11.619
And trust in Jehovah will help you in your assignments.

00:45:11.619 --> 00:45:16.619
Like Ebid Melek, continue to trust in Jehovah.

00:45:16.619 --> 00:45:20.619
You know, one day I hope to get to know all of you students.

00:45:20.619 --> 00:45:23.619
Then we can truly say that we trust one another.

00:45:23.619 --> 00:45:30.619
Until then, continue to trust in Jehovah so that he can say of you dear Gilead students.

00:45:30.619 --> 00:45:32.619
You trusted in me.

00:45:32.619 --> 00:45:48.389
Well, we thank you for that excellent advice, Brother Myers.

00:45:48.389 --> 00:45:52.389
And now we're looking forward to hearing from one of the Gilead instructors.

00:45:52.389 --> 00:45:56.389
And I'm sure all of the students are going to be interested to hear what he has to say.

00:45:56.389 --> 00:46:03.389
Brother James Cawthon is going to speak to us on the subject, shaken, but not forsaken.

00:46:03.389 --> 00:46:08.429
Congratulations.

00:46:08.429 --> 00:46:14.429
Today, you become a graduate of the 147th class of Gilead.

00:46:14.429 --> 00:46:16.429
It's a day to be celebrated.

00:46:16.429 --> 00:46:18.429
It's a day to be enjoyed.

00:46:18.429 --> 00:46:19.429
And you deserve it.

00:46:19.429 --> 00:46:21.429
You were taught.

00:46:21.429 --> 00:46:24.429
And even when you thought you had reached your limit.

00:46:24.429 --> 00:46:26.429
You didn't give up.

00:46:26.429 --> 00:46:27.429
You kept coming in.

00:46:27.429 --> 00:46:30.429
You kept trusting in Jehovah.

00:46:30.429 --> 00:46:38.429
As your instructors were very pleased to see your happy smiling faces.

00:46:38.429 --> 00:46:45.429
And if we could, we'd wish that for you every day for the rest of your lives.

00:46:45.429 --> 00:46:50.429
However, as much as we try, we can't control what happens to us in life.

00:46:50.429 --> 00:46:52.429
Isn't that true?

00:46:52.429 --> 00:46:56.429
A change comes for everyone.

00:46:56.429 --> 00:46:59.429
Sooner or later, it's inevitable.

00:46:59.429 --> 00:47:01.429
Some changes are small.

00:47:01.429 --> 00:47:08.429
Other changes, however, can rock our world and leave us shaken to the core.

00:47:08.429 --> 00:47:14.429
And when that happens, we may suddenly find that we're no longer the person we thought we were.

00:47:14.429 --> 00:47:20.429
It can seem as if our very identity has been ripped away from us.

00:47:20.429 --> 00:47:22.429
Consider Moses.

00:47:22.429 --> 00:47:27.429
Moses grew up in one of the most luxurious places on earth at the time.

00:47:27.429 --> 00:47:30.429
That is the Egyptian oil court.

00:47:30.429 --> 00:47:37.429
Memories of the royal household resided in opulent mansions that were dotted along the Nile.

00:47:37.429 --> 00:47:42.429
These homes were decorated in precious stones, incorporated pools and gardens,

00:47:42.429 --> 00:47:47.429
a house to large staff that prepared lavish meals.

00:47:47.429 --> 00:47:54.429
Moses likely had a knowledge and understanding of some of the most amazing structures the world has ever seen.

00:47:54.429 --> 00:47:56.429
And why?

00:47:56.429 --> 00:48:06.429
Likely, it's because he was schooled from a young age in subjects such as writing and math, science, architecture.

00:48:06.429 --> 00:48:15.429
In addition, Moses may have witnessed Egypt's rise to become a mighty empire and a powerful military.

00:48:15.429 --> 00:48:19.429
Moses enjoyed a privilege and extravagant upbringing.

00:48:19.429 --> 00:48:23.429
And no doubt he became a man of confidence and influence.

00:48:23.429 --> 00:48:26.429
Acts chapter 7 verse 22 says,

00:48:26.429 --> 00:48:30.429
So Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians.

00:48:30.429 --> 00:48:35.429
In fact, he was powerful in his words and deeds.

00:48:35.429 --> 00:48:40.429
So when he killed an Egyptian on behalf of his fellow, he grew brother.

00:48:40.429 --> 00:48:43.429
He saw himself as a deliverer.

00:48:43.429 --> 00:48:49.429
He was confident, he was ready, but he was wrong.

00:48:49.429 --> 00:48:51.429
We know what happened.

00:48:51.429 --> 00:48:59.429
He fled to Midian, no longer the favorite prince, no longer in charge of anyone except some sheep.

00:48:59.429 --> 00:49:07.429
The confidence he knew back in Egypt had been replaced with confusion, loss, and fear.

00:49:07.429 --> 00:49:11.429
Moses must have been shaken.

00:49:11.429 --> 00:49:18.429
So often, disappointments in life bring on feelings of sadness, self-doubt, worthlessness,

00:49:18.429 --> 00:49:23.429
and that those things in effect strip us of our cherished identity.

00:49:23.429 --> 00:49:31.429
And we're especially vulnerable if we define ourselves by our natural skills and qualities,

00:49:31.429 --> 00:49:37.429
or by what others think of us, or even by our assignment or position.

00:49:37.429 --> 00:49:45.429
In effect, when we do that, we're saying, I am what I do, or I am what others think of me.

00:49:45.429 --> 00:49:51.429
These are deceptive filters that cause us to lose sight of who we really are.

00:49:51.429 --> 00:49:55.429
And then, when change comes, we're shaken.

00:49:55.429 --> 00:49:58.429
But are we forsaken?

00:49:58.429 --> 00:50:01.429
Let's consider Moses again.

00:50:01.429 --> 00:50:03.429
Moses was a chosen one, too.

00:50:03.429 --> 00:50:07.429
Was Moses a chosen one to deliver the Hebrews?

00:50:07.429 --> 00:50:09.429
Well, the answer is yes.

00:50:09.429 --> 00:50:11.429
Was it Jehovah's time?

00:50:11.429 --> 00:50:13.429
The answer is no.

00:50:13.429 --> 00:50:18.429
And neither was he fully qualified for the appointment or the assignment.

00:50:18.429 --> 00:50:25.429
You see, he needed divine training, and that was something that he could not get in Egypt.

00:50:25.429 --> 00:50:30.429
It's true he had worldly education, he had confidence, he had poise.

00:50:30.429 --> 00:50:39.429
But he needed the qualities of patience, maintenance, humility, and self-control to be developed to a greater degree.

00:50:39.429 --> 00:50:44.429
Jehovah saw that, and he knew just how to accomplish it.

00:50:44.429 --> 00:50:50.429
That would be the lowly occupation of a shepherd in Median.

00:50:51.429 --> 00:51:03.429
Now, after 40 years, Moses seized the flaming thorn bush, and to his surprise and shock, Jehovah commissions him.

00:51:03.429 --> 00:51:06.429
40 years later.

00:51:06.429 --> 00:51:10.429
Now, think about how Moses must have felt at that moment.

00:51:10.429 --> 00:51:15.429
The realization that he wasn't worthless, the Jehovah still valued him.

00:51:15.429 --> 00:51:31.429
His daily pain of heart over the suffering of his fellow Hebrews was now being replaced with a keen anticipation for what Jehovah was going to do and no doubt in a marvelous way.

00:51:31.429 --> 00:51:36.429
So you see, Moses was never really forsaken by God.

00:51:36.429 --> 00:51:43.429
No rather, Jehovah had been with him every step of the way, those 40 years.

00:51:43.429 --> 00:51:53.429
He was molding him, preparing him for an incredible future assignment that he could never have possibly imagined.

00:51:53.429 --> 00:51:56.429
Jehovah will do the same for you.

00:51:56.429 --> 00:51:59.429
You see, he takes a long range view.

00:51:59.429 --> 00:52:01.429
He sees your potential.

00:52:01.429 --> 00:52:04.429
He knows how to accomplish it.

00:52:04.429 --> 00:52:14.429
Remember that Jehovah will do it at the right time, and at his time, and that his view must be our view.

00:52:14.429 --> 00:52:20.429
So when a change comes, whatever it may be, it's just the scene.

00:52:20.429 --> 00:52:22.429
It's not the entire movie.

00:52:22.429 --> 00:52:24.429
It's a chapter.

00:52:24.429 --> 00:52:26.429
It's not the book.

00:52:26.429 --> 00:52:30.429
You may not know what's coming next, but don't worry.

00:52:30.429 --> 00:52:32.429
Jehovah does.

00:52:32.429 --> 00:52:43.429
Decades later, after leading Jehovah's people out of Egypt and navigating through the wilderness, it was now time for Joshua to step up.

00:52:43.429 --> 00:52:53.429
At Deuteronomy 31 verse 8, Moses said to Joshua, Jehovah will neither desert you nor abandon you.

00:52:53.429 --> 00:52:56.429
Those must have been very encouraging words.

00:52:56.429 --> 00:53:01.429
You see, Moses never forgot the lesson he learned all those years ago.

00:53:01.429 --> 00:53:06.429
He had been shaken, yes, but he was not forsaken.

00:53:06.429 --> 00:53:12.429
And perhaps that was his motivation for writing another passage in the Bible.

00:53:12.429 --> 00:53:22.429
So if you remember this, anyone dwelling in the secret place of the Most High will lodge under the shadow of the Almighty.

00:53:22.429 --> 00:53:30.429
I will say to Jehovah, you are my refuge and my stronghold, my God in whom I trust.

00:53:30.429 --> 00:53:32.429
Sounds familiar?

00:53:32.429 --> 00:53:34.429
Psalm 91.

00:53:34.429 --> 00:53:44.429
Moses had become absolutely convinced that Jehovah was always with him through the good times and through the hard times.

00:53:44.429 --> 00:53:54.429
So like Moses, you'll experience joys, some disappointments, and sooner or later change.

00:53:54.429 --> 00:53:58.429
Perhaps a change away from a cherished assignment.

00:53:58.429 --> 00:54:01.429
It may feel devastating.

00:54:01.429 --> 00:54:05.429
You can either roll with it or you can be rolled over by it.

00:54:05.429 --> 00:54:09.000
How will you roll with it?

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.000
You can roll with it if you remember.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.000
You are not your career.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000
You are not your assignment.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000
You are not your privilege.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.000
You are, however, loved by God.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:27.000
You have a spiritual heritage and you have a wonderful bright future.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:32.000
And when you remember that, you can gracefully accept the changes that come.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.000
And there's something else you can do.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:38.000
You can use your experience to help others.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:49.000
In fact, your willingness to help others even when you're shaken by a personal experience will reveal your loyalty and your maturity.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:53.000
Do little things as if they were great things.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:57.000
Small tasks reveal a big heart.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:01.000
It's all part of our training now and for life in the new world.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000
And remember this too.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:11.000
A change of circumstances is rarely as important as a change of attitude.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:18.000
So it's not your position, but it will be your disposition that will

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.000
bring Jehovah's blessing.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:25.000
So in conclusion, yes, change will come.

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.000
The world changes.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000
Circumstances change.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000
We change.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:34.000
However, Jehovah does not change.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.000
His Word does not change.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:39.000
And his love for you will never change.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:47.000
So while you may be shaken at times, rest assured you will never, ever be.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:56:05.329
For shaken.

00:56:05.329 --> 00:56:07.329
I don't know about you, but I mark down.

00:56:07.329 --> 00:56:09.329
It's not your position.

00:56:09.329 --> 00:56:10.329
It's your disposition.

00:56:10.329 --> 00:56:12.329
I'll be using that one in the future.

00:56:12.329 --> 00:56:16.329
Thank you very, very much for those excellent thoughts.

00:56:16.329 --> 00:56:21.329
Well, now we have the privilege to hear from another of the Gilead instructors, Brother Mark Numer.

00:56:21.329 --> 00:56:23.329
He's going to speak to us on the topic.

00:56:23.329 --> 00:56:30.360
Remember the vision.

00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:35.360
One of the rarest privileges a human has ever had.

00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:40.360
Is to see a vision of Jehovah's throne.

00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:48.360
And it's good for us now to look on with a man who had this privilege.

00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:52.360
And how the vision changed his life.

00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:55.360
What were the circumstances around this event?

00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:59.360
And more importantly, for you, how does it affect you?

00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:03.360
And what lessons do we want you to take to heart?

00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:14.360
So please open your Bibles or listen closely to these words recorded at Isaiah chapter 6 and verse 1.

00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:16.360
Isaiah 6, 1.

00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:27.989
In the year that King Isaiah died, I saw Jehovah sitting on a lofty and elevated throne

00:57:27.989 --> 00:57:32.989
with the skirts of his robe filled the temple.

00:57:33.989 --> 00:57:39.989
The skirts of Jehovah's magnificent garments filling the temple.

00:57:39.989 --> 00:57:41.989
This is what Isaiah saw.

00:57:41.989 --> 00:57:43.989
What does it show?

00:57:43.989 --> 00:57:51.989
It shows that Jehovah is figuratively present in the temple and he was keenly aware of everything

00:57:51.989 --> 00:57:58.989
that was going on there, including what had happened with King Isaiah.

00:57:58.989 --> 00:58:04.989
Now recall, Isaiah, not content with his role as King.

00:58:04.989 --> 00:58:05.989
What did he do?

00:58:05.989 --> 00:58:09.989
He forces way into the holy compartment of the temple.

00:58:09.989 --> 00:58:10.989
Why?

00:58:10.989 --> 00:58:13.989
To burn incense, like a priest.

00:58:13.989 --> 00:58:18.989
And for that, he was struck with leprosy.

00:58:18.989 --> 00:58:24.989
But it is of interest that Jehovah inspired Isaiah to write,

00:58:24.989 --> 00:58:31.989
not in the year that Joseph, Isaiah's son, became king,

00:58:31.989 --> 00:58:36.989
but rather in the year that King Isaiah died.

00:58:36.989 --> 00:58:43.989
By directing Isaiah to pen those words in the year that Isaiah died,

00:58:43.989 --> 00:58:52.989
it could be said that Jehovah was setting this stage for teaching Isaiah what qualities he loves

00:58:52.989 --> 00:58:55.989
and what qualities he hates.

00:58:55.989 --> 00:59:01.989
So you see, this vision is going to be life-changing for Isaiah

00:59:01.989 --> 00:59:04.989
and we want it to be life-changing for you.

00:59:04.989 --> 00:59:06.989
So what happens next?

00:59:06.989 --> 00:59:15.989
Well, verse 2 shows that Jehovah reveals something perhaps no other human has seen in vision.

00:59:16.989 --> 00:59:22.989
Serifs, Isaiah is the only Bible writer that mentions them.

00:59:22.989 --> 00:59:28.989
Now, the privileges, these serifs enjoy their high rank

00:59:28.989 --> 00:59:37.989
and serving close to the universal sovereign, move them to humbly cover their faces with their wings

00:59:37.989 --> 00:59:44.989
and sing Jehovah's praises with such power that the temple foundation shakes.

00:59:45.989 --> 00:59:52.989
What lesson in contrast could Jehovah have been impressing on Isaiah?

00:59:52.989 --> 01:00:00.989
Well, consider this, Isaiah became king at only 16 years old

01:00:00.989 --> 01:00:04.989
and showed tremendous potential at the outset.

01:00:04.989 --> 01:00:12.989
When Isaiah became a prophet, he too was a young man, most likely in his 20s.

01:00:12.989 --> 01:00:17.989
He was married to a supportive wife. She's called a prophetess.

01:00:17.989 --> 01:00:25.989
So by showing Isaiah, the example of these humble serifs in the same year, Isaiah died.

01:00:25.989 --> 01:00:32.989
It was as if Jehovah was saying, you know, Isaiah, you're a fine young man.

01:00:32.989 --> 01:00:35.989
You have a bright future. You have a good wife.

01:00:35.989 --> 01:00:40.989
But don't become presumptuous like Isaiah.

01:00:41.989 --> 01:00:45.989
What a powerful contrast for Isaiah to meditate on.

01:00:45.989 --> 01:00:48.989
No doubt this affected him deeply.

01:00:48.989 --> 01:00:51.989
And this is your first lesson.

01:00:51.989 --> 01:00:56.989
Like Isaiah, you have a bright future.

01:00:56.989 --> 01:01:00.989
Don't miss the purpose of why you've been called to Gilead.

01:01:00.989 --> 01:01:03.989
Your assignment is to honor Jehovah God.

01:01:03.989 --> 01:01:07.989
You've been trained to support his organization.

01:01:07.989 --> 01:01:11.989
We are investing in you for the future.

01:01:11.989 --> 01:01:15.989
So remember the vision.

01:01:15.989 --> 01:01:17.989
Imitate the serifs.

01:01:17.989 --> 01:01:20.989
Cover your face.

01:01:20.989 --> 01:01:26.989
And don't spoil your humility by drawing undue attention to yourself.

01:01:26.989 --> 01:01:33.989
You see, even the most subtle boasting invites others to take a peek at you

01:01:33.989 --> 01:01:35.989
and look in. Who are you?

01:01:35.989 --> 01:01:40.989
What are you doing? No. That detracts from Jehovah's glory.

01:01:40.989 --> 01:01:46.989
So when tempted to blow your own horn, remember the mighty song of the serifs.

01:01:46.989 --> 01:01:49.989
Sing Jehovah's praises, not your own.

01:01:49.989 --> 01:01:54.989
Any privilege you receive should make you more humble.

01:01:54.989 --> 01:01:58.989
Like the serifs, not puff you up like Isaiah.

01:01:58.989 --> 01:02:03.989
And by remaining humble, Jehovah can use you to a greater extent.

01:02:03.989 --> 01:02:08.989
Why? Because he can trust you to give him the glory.

01:02:08.989 --> 01:02:10.989
Serifs.

01:02:10.989 --> 01:02:12.989
They don't aspire to be kings.

01:02:12.989 --> 01:02:14.989
They don't aspire to be priests.

01:02:14.989 --> 01:02:18.989
But they're content with their role as workers.

01:02:18.989 --> 01:02:25.989
So be like the serifs by doing your part to advance pure worship.

01:02:25.989 --> 01:02:28.989
What else could Isaiah learn from this song?

01:02:29.989 --> 01:02:33.989
Well, chapter 6, verse 3b, it says,

01:02:33.989 --> 01:02:37.989
The whole earth is filled with his glory.

01:02:37.989 --> 01:02:40.989
Now that's an interesting statement.

01:02:40.989 --> 01:02:45.989
Why may Jehovah have included those words as part of the vision?

01:02:45.989 --> 01:02:47.989
Well, consider this.

01:02:47.989 --> 01:02:51.989
Isaiah was faced with extreme apathy in his assignment.

01:02:51.989 --> 01:02:54.989
The land of Judah was full of false worship, the rebellious,

01:02:54.989 --> 01:02:58.989
and tribe kingdom of Samaria had rejected Jehovah to Isaiah.

01:02:58.989 --> 01:03:01.989
It could have felt like no one is glorifying Jehovah.

01:03:01.989 --> 01:03:03.989
Where's the glory for Jehovah?

01:03:03.989 --> 01:03:09.989
If he focused on those trials, it could have been so easy for him to get discouraged to give up.

01:03:09.989 --> 01:03:12.989
What's the use? Why should I put up with this?

01:03:12.989 --> 01:03:14.989
No one is listening.

01:03:14.989 --> 01:03:17.989
So what would help him not to give up?

01:03:17.989 --> 01:03:20.989
He would need to go back to the vision.

01:03:20.989 --> 01:03:26.989
And imagine a future time the whole earth being filled with Jehovah's glory.

01:03:26.989 --> 01:03:33.989
With eyes of faith, Isaiah would focus on what Jehovah was yet to accomplish as part of his purpose.

01:03:33.989 --> 01:03:41.989
Jehovah strengthened Isaiah with prophecies about the future when the whole earth would be filled with his glory.

01:03:41.989 --> 01:03:46.989
Prophecies about the Messiah, the restoration of true worship.

01:03:46.989 --> 01:03:51.989
Isaiah himself even witnessed the prophecy being fulfilled in his own lifetime,

01:03:51.989 --> 01:03:56.989
the fall of the Ten Tribe, the kingdom to the Assyrians.

01:03:56.989 --> 01:04:01.989
Then, more than 40 years later, after his hard work,

01:04:01.989 --> 01:04:09.989
imagine he was honored to record one of the most spectacular demonstrations of God's executional power in all scripture,

01:04:09.989 --> 01:04:14.989
the destruction of 185,000 soldiers in one night.

01:04:14.989 --> 01:04:22.989
And outstanding reminder, Isaiah, my glory is filling indeed the whole earth.

01:04:22.989 --> 01:04:26.989
He was as if Jehovah was saying, Isaiah, listen.

01:04:26.989 --> 01:04:31.989
I know you see badness among people, but keep your focus.

01:04:31.989 --> 01:04:38.989
Focus on the good things that I'm accomplishing right now and will accomplish in the future.

01:04:38.989 --> 01:04:41.989
And this is lesson number two for you.

01:04:42.989 --> 01:04:46.989
When you find yourself becoming consumed with trials,

01:04:46.989 --> 01:04:51.989
the imperfections of others, maybe some of you work with two, three, four, five here and there.

01:04:51.989 --> 01:04:56.989
Ooh, the frustrations of the work being passed over again for a privilege.

01:04:56.989 --> 01:04:59.989
You start thinking, but what's the use of working hard?

01:04:59.989 --> 01:05:03.989
Why am I trying so hard to apply the good training I've received at Gilead?

01:05:03.989 --> 01:05:05.989
No one here cares.

01:05:05.989 --> 01:05:07.989
Take a deep breath.

01:05:07.989 --> 01:05:09.989
Back away.

01:05:09.989 --> 01:05:11.989
Turn to the vision.

01:05:11.989 --> 01:05:16.989
Shift the focus off yourself and on to the big picture.

01:05:16.989 --> 01:05:21.989
Which is the whole earth being filled with Jehovah's glory.

01:05:21.989 --> 01:05:30.400
Put your focus on the 8.5 million people earth wide that are glorifying Jehovah God

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:32.400
in His great spiritual temple.

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:37.400
Each one is playing a small but valuable role in accomplishing Jehovah's purpose.

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:45.969
If you do that, it will help you to cherish your place in God's global arrangement.

01:05:45.969 --> 01:05:48.969
Next comes the invitation.

01:05:48.969 --> 01:05:50.969
The invitation.

01:05:50.969 --> 01:05:52.969
Here it comes.

01:05:52.969 --> 01:05:55.969
And oh, that invitation in verse 8.

01:05:55.969 --> 01:05:58.969
It is so real, so vivid to Isaiah.

01:05:58.969 --> 01:06:00.969
He's moved to declare, here I am.

01:06:00.969 --> 01:06:03.969
Here I am, send me.

01:06:03.969 --> 01:06:05.969
No hesitation.

01:06:05.969 --> 01:06:07.969
He didn't ask what he would gain.

01:06:07.969 --> 01:06:11.969
He didn't ask what other assignments his contemporary prophets got.

01:06:11.969 --> 01:06:12.969
What about that one?

01:06:12.969 --> 01:06:13.969
What about this one?

01:06:13.969 --> 01:06:14.969
What's Micah going to do?

01:06:14.969 --> 01:06:16.969
We'll see in what I know.

01:06:16.969 --> 01:06:20.969
He just said, here I am, send me.

01:06:20.969 --> 01:06:22.969
Isn't that amazing?

01:06:22.969 --> 01:06:26.969
And the fact is, he didn't know everything he was signing up for.

01:06:26.969 --> 01:06:29.969
Those details would come later.

01:06:29.969 --> 01:06:33.250
And they did.

01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:35.250
About 17 years later.

01:06:35.250 --> 01:06:40.250
Now Isaiah is told to take his small son, Sheer Jeship.

01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:43.250
And go meet King Ahaz.

01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:46.250
Wicked King Ahaz and offer him help.

01:06:46.250 --> 01:06:49.250
I mean, can you imagine Isaiah?

01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:50.250
What was he thinking?

01:06:50.250 --> 01:06:51.250
Now, wait a minute.

01:06:51.250 --> 01:06:52.250
Wait a minute Jehovah.

01:06:52.250 --> 01:06:55.250
Ahaz murders his own children.

01:06:55.250 --> 01:06:58.250
And now you want me to take my son along?

01:06:58.250 --> 01:07:02.250
I said here, I am, send me, not us.

01:07:02.250 --> 01:07:06.250
And what about his wife?

01:07:06.250 --> 01:07:07.250
What about his wife?

01:07:07.250 --> 01:07:10.250
Isaiah, you're not taking my little boy.

01:07:10.250 --> 01:07:12.250
Sheer Jeship, get back here.

01:07:12.250 --> 01:07:16.250
I mean, you don't know, but it just helped you to think about this.

01:07:16.250 --> 01:07:23.250
So, both Isaiah and his wife would need to return to the vision

01:07:23.250 --> 01:07:26.250
for reassurance that Jehovah's skirts.

01:07:26.250 --> 01:07:28.250
His attention was indeed filling Judah.

01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:30.250
He was aware of everything.

01:07:30.250 --> 01:07:34.250
They would need to trust in Jehovah, follow his direction.

01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:37.250
Isaiah and FX said, I'll go.

01:07:37.250 --> 01:07:38.250
I'll go.

01:07:38.250 --> 01:07:41.250
I'll be faithful even if the King is not.

01:07:41.250 --> 01:07:46.250
Isaiah did not let the tests of others make him fail his.

01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:49.559
Lesson number three.

01:07:49.559 --> 01:07:54.559
Assignments to support the kingdom work are not always easy.

01:07:54.559 --> 01:07:57.559
And your wives feel it too.

01:07:57.559 --> 01:08:01.559
And when your husband receives an assignment, perhaps no one else wanted,

01:08:01.559 --> 01:08:04.559
you play a crucial role.

01:08:04.559 --> 01:08:07.559
How will you respond when he tells you of the assignment?

01:08:07.559 --> 01:08:09.559
Why did they pick you?

01:08:09.559 --> 01:08:11.559
Can't you tell them to find someone else?

01:08:11.559 --> 01:08:13.559
You did it last time.

01:08:13.559 --> 01:08:17.560
Or will you be proud of your husband?

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:21.560
Proud of him for being Isaiah-like, accepting the assignments faithfully,

01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:23.560
even volunteering for them?

01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:25.560
You wives.

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:31.560
Your support is priceless in God's eyes and can make all the difference.

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:37.029
How do you think Isaiah remembered the vision?

01:08:37.029 --> 01:08:42.029
No doubt he recalled not only the images, but the sounds.

01:08:42.029 --> 01:08:46.029
Oh, Jehovah's skirts stretching, filling the temple.

01:08:46.029 --> 01:08:49.029
This serves powerful wings beating through the air.

01:08:49.029 --> 01:08:52.029
The melodious words echoing in song.

01:08:52.029 --> 01:08:56.029
They would no doubt be permanently etched in his mind.

01:08:56.029 --> 01:09:02.029
We can only imagine that Isaiah and his wife replayed that vision over and over again in their minds.

01:09:02.029 --> 01:09:05.029
And how it must have helped them to hold on to Jehovah.

01:09:05.029 --> 01:09:08.029
Never let go for those 40 years, plus 40 years.

01:09:08.029 --> 01:09:11.029
And the vision can do the same for you.

01:09:11.029 --> 01:09:13.029
That's the point.

01:09:13.029 --> 01:09:18.029
This inspired vision, this holy scripture, can help you to stick to Jehovah.

01:09:18.029 --> 01:09:22.029
And never let go, especially when times are hard.

01:09:22.029 --> 01:09:26.029
When you are struggling to keep a float spiritually, you have a challenge you have to overcome.

01:09:26.029 --> 01:09:31.029
You might even feel at times like you're swimming in mud.

01:09:31.029 --> 01:09:33.029
Don't give up.

01:09:33.029 --> 01:09:35.029
Make the vision come alive in your mind.

01:09:35.029 --> 01:09:36.029
See the images.

01:09:36.029 --> 01:09:37.029
Hear the sounds.

01:09:37.029 --> 01:09:40.029
Feel the odds Isaiah must have felt.

01:09:40.029 --> 01:09:43.029
And then, and then apply the lessons in your life.

01:09:43.029 --> 01:09:48.029
Apply these wonderful scriptural lessons in your life.

01:09:48.029 --> 01:09:50.029
Immitate the serfs.

01:09:50.029 --> 01:09:51.029
Cover your face.

01:09:51.029 --> 01:09:52.029
Stay humble.

01:09:52.029 --> 01:09:55.029
See God's glory feeling the whole earth.

01:09:55.029 --> 01:09:57.029
Focus on the big picture.

01:09:57.029 --> 01:09:58.029
Keep a blaze.

01:09:58.029 --> 01:10:00.029
The here I am, send me.

01:10:00.029 --> 01:10:01.029
Fire.

01:10:01.029 --> 01:10:02.029
Yes.

01:10:02.029 --> 01:10:03.029
Remember the vision.

01:10:03.029 --> 01:10:09.029
And let it motivate you to keep your cherished place in God's great spiritual temple now.

01:10:09.029 --> 01:10:12.029
And in Jehovah's heart for all eternity.

01:10:12.029 --> 01:10:30.750
Well, we thank you so much, Brother Numer, for those excellent thoughts.

01:10:30.750 --> 01:10:36.750
It truly was a spiritually enriching Gilead program.

01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:44.750
And in the coming weeks, parts two and three of the graduation will be released on JW Broadcasting.

01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:47.750
So keep on the lookout.

01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:52.750
We'll conclude this month's program, traveling to the island of Reunion,

01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:58.750
located in the Indian Ocean between Madagascar and Mauritius.

01:10:58.750 --> 01:11:07.750
It's decorated with beautiful volcanic sand beaches, waterfalls, deep valleys, rugged peaks,

01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:13.750
and one of the most active volcanoes on earth, Pitone de la Funez.

01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:19.750
The first kingdom publisher arrived to Reunion in 1955.

01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:24.750
Now, more than 3,000 of our brothers and sisters are serving there.

01:11:24.750 --> 01:11:28.750
Over 400 of them are regular pioneers.

01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:34.750
While French is the official language of the island, there are three congregations in Malagasy

01:11:34.750 --> 01:11:40.750
and 13 in the common tongue of Creole of Reunion.

01:11:40.750 --> 01:11:51.750
Because of the brother's evangelizing spirit, over 6,500 people on Reunion attended the memorial in 2018.

01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:54.750
This is the Grombois congregation.

01:11:54.750 --> 01:12:00.750
They have more than 130 publishers with 13 regular pioneers.
