WEBVTT

00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:05.070
Welcome to all.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:10.630
We have with us, Brother Robert Lucioni, a helper to the publishing committee, to read our

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.919
scripture text for today.

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:17.519
Today is Saturday, March 27.

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:21.960
The text is taken from Romans 8-16.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.160
The spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are God's children.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.649
Thank you, Rob.

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:39.649
It is my great pleasure to welcome all of you in our Worldwide Brotherhood to our morning

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:41.090
worship program.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.210
And what a very special day this is for all of us.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:54.609
After sundown tonight will be the equivalent of Nisan 14 according to the ancient Jewish calendar.

00:00:54.609 --> 00:01:06.010
In Nisan 1433 CE, in harmony with Jehovah's will, Jesus willingly gave His perfect human life.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:12.769
He did this to redeem mankind from the sin of Adam, our first human father.

00:01:12.769 --> 00:01:19.170
Likely all of us are familiar with the account of Adam and Eve, our original earthly parents.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.930
When Adam was created, he had the prospect of living forever.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.810
That was Jehovah's original purpose.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.329
Of course, Jehovah made it very clear that his enjoyment of everlasting life was dependent

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:36.650
on his obedience.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:43.170
A simple, non-complicated, easy to follow test of obedience was established.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.170
Don't eat from one tree in the garden.

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:52.090
Sadly, we all know what happened.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:02:00.650
Under the influence of a renegade spirit creature sat in the devil, Eve partook of the fruit of that tree.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:07.530
And Adam foolishly could not resist or offer, and he did the same.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:15.250
By disobeying God, Adam lost the prospect of everlasting life.

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:18.689
But now, how did that affect us?

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:23.169
For the answer, please go to Romans chapter 5.

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:26.210
And let's read verse number 12.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:34.569
That is why, just this through one man, Adam, sin entered into the world and death through sin.

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:40.810
And so, death spread to all men because he had all sinned.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.849
You'll notice that death came from sinful Adam.

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:47.050
It didn't come from Jehovah.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:54.610
Just as a serious genetic defect can be passed on to one's offspring, when Adam and Eve had children,

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.889
they passed on the death sentence.

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:04.129
But did you notice that long dash at the end of verse 12, we just read?

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:06.129
Why is it there?

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:10.210
It's because in Greek, Paul did not complete his thought.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.169
He left a cliffhanger.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:21.250
In Greek, whenever a sin that starts with the words just as, it should conclude with a clause that includes the words,

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.009
so also, thus completing the thought.

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:30.610
Well, in verse 12, Paul makes clear who is responsible for death.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.490
Just this through one man, death spread.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.530
But he leaves the resolution of the problem hanging.

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:48.569
However, in verse 19, using the same Greek grammar, Paul now completes the thought with so also.

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:54.090
Thereby, completing, we could say, the cliffhanger, let's read verse 19.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:02.569
For just as, through the disobedience of the one man many were made sinners, so also,

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:09.490
through the obedience of the one person many will be made righteous.

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:15.330
Yes, Jesus is identified as the solution.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:25.370
Thanks to Jesus giving his life in our behalf, now we have the hope of everlasting life.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.250
Some have the hope of everlasting life in heaven.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:36.610
But the vast majority have the hope of living forever in perfection on a beautifully restored earth.

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:41.970
After all, that was Jehovah's original purpose for the earth, was it not?

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.970
And whatever Jehovah starts, he finishes.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:57.889
But now our text for today, Romans 8.16 is referring to those who have the hope of everlasting life in heaven,

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:01.889
serving alongside Christ in his Messianic kingdom.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:08.189
Let's read it again together, Romans 8.16.

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:16.509
The spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are God's children.

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:22.430
But how does God's spirit bear witness with a person so that he knows he has been anointed

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.149
for a future role in heaven?

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:28.430
Well, the reason on this, let's go to the book of Acts.

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:35.709
And first, if you will, just scan Acts chapter 1 verses 4 and 5, which tell us about how Jesus

00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:42.509
appeared to his followers a few days after he was resurrected and instructed them to stay in

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:48.110
Jerusalem and wait for a special gift, the Holy Spirit.

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:55.230
Well, true to Jesus' words, a few days later on the day of Pentecost, Holy Spirit was poured out.

00:05:56.189 --> 00:06:03.870
About 120 disciples were assembled in an upper room and when that Holy Spirit filled them.

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:12.750
It was spectacular. Let's read about it in Acts chapter 2, beginning in verse number 2.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:20.670
Suddenly there was a noise from heaven, just like that of a rushing stiff breeze,

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:28.990
and it filled the whole house where they were sitting, and tongues as if a fire became visible

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:34.029
to them, and were distributed, and one came to rest on each one of them.

00:06:34.829 --> 00:06:42.029
And they all became filled with Holy Spirit and started to speak in different languages,

00:06:42.829 --> 00:06:46.029
just as the spirit enabled them to speak.

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:54.589
These 120 disciples became the first ones to be anointed by Holy Spirit and given the hope of

00:06:54.589 --> 00:07:00.509
ruling with Jesus in heaven. Obviously, they would never forget that experience.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:08.589
For a certainty, there was no question in their minds that God's spirit bore witness with their

00:07:08.589 --> 00:07:15.870
spirit. But now what about after that momentous event? Would all those chosen to be

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:21.389
with Christ in heaven have some miraculous display? Has did the 120?

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:31.069
The answers no. To reason on this point, let's go to verses 37 and 38 of Acts chapter 2,

00:07:31.949 --> 00:07:38.350
which talk about what happened to thousands who became new anointed disciples later on that very

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:42.029
same day of Pentecost. Notice beginning of verse 37,

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:49.310
Now when they heard this, they were stabbed to the heart, and they said to Peter in the rest

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:58.029
of the apostles, man, brothers, what should we do? Peter said to them, repent, and let each one of

00:07:58.029 --> 00:08:06.829
you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the

00:08:06.829 --> 00:08:15.550
free gift of the Holy Spirit. Well, verse 41 indicates there were about 3,000 who were baptized.

00:08:16.509 --> 00:08:21.389
But did you notice that even though they were anointed by Holy Spirit after their baptism,

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:30.350
they did not experience any of the spectacular manifestations that the 120 had experienced earlier

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:38.429
that very same day. But now this raises another question, does this account mean that newly anointed

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:45.470
ones will have God-spirit bear witness with their spirit on the day of their baptism? Again,

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:54.669
the answers no. To reason on this, please go to Acts chapter 8, and let's notice a very interesting

00:08:54.669 --> 00:09:03.950
account that begins in verse 14. When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:10.909
Word of God, they sent Peter and John to them, and these went down and prayed for them

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:19.629
to get Holy Spirit, for it had not yet come upon any one of them, but they had only been baptized

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:27.230
in the name of the Lord Jesus. Then they laid their hands on them, and they began to receive Holy

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:35.870
Spirit. Well, these verses describe how the spirit-bearing witness with these anointed ones in Samaria

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:44.190
occurred sometime after their baptism, and that is what occurs in our time. Jehovah spirit bears

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:54.029
witness with a person sometime after his baptism, and after he or she has had opportunity to establish

00:09:54.029 --> 00:10:02.190
a course of faithfulness. But now we ask, how does a person know clearly whether he or she

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:10.029
has the heavenly calling? Well, please go to 1 John chapter 2, and let's get some help with that

00:10:10.029 --> 00:10:19.870
question. 1 John 2, verse 20, and you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you have

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:27.389
knowledge. Such ones have knowledge, they know for a certainty. They've been anointed. Now look at

00:10:27.389 --> 00:10:37.309
verse number 27. And as for you, the anointing that you receive from Him remains in you, and you

00:10:37.389 --> 00:10:44.269
do not need anyone to be teaching you. But the anointing from Him is teaching you about all things

00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:54.029
and is true and is no lie. So anointed ones don't need confirmation from anyone else. Their anointing

00:10:54.029 --> 00:11:03.389
is clear, true, affirmative. Think about it. The Holy Spirit is the most powerful force in the

00:11:03.389 --> 00:11:12.110
universe. Jehovah used it to create the sun moon stars. He used it to create all life in heaven

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:21.470
and earth. He also used it to communicate his message to the Bible writers. In fact, Jehovah

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:28.669
is the greatest communicator in the universe. So if his powerful Holy Spirit bears witness with

00:11:28.669 --> 00:11:37.149
a person, he is not going to communicate, maybe you have been called to heavenly life, leaving the

00:11:37.149 --> 00:11:46.669
person in doubt, a dilemma, a quandary. No, it is going to be an absolute affirmative communication,

00:11:47.549 --> 00:11:57.309
leaving the person with no question in his mind or heart. So if a person is wondering, if he is

00:11:57.309 --> 00:12:06.750
anointed or not, the answer is obvious, isn't it? He is not. But what about the millions who do not

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:13.389
have this change of hope communicated to them by God's Spirit? Well, they have the glorious hope

00:12:13.389 --> 00:12:19.789
that Jehovah originally purpose for mankind before there was any need for humans to be adopted to

00:12:19.789 --> 00:12:29.230
the heavens, everlasting life in a paradise earth. In fact, just a few verses after our text for today,

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:39.789
in Romans 8, verse 21, it says, of human creation. The creation itself will also be set free from

00:12:39.789 --> 00:12:48.659
enslavement to corruption and have the glorious freedom of the children of God. So whether our hope

00:12:48.659 --> 00:12:57.059
is life in heaven or life on earth, how all of us as Jehovah's people worldwide look forward

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:07.860
to our marvelous hope of everlasting life. And later today, after sundown, when we observe the memorial

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:15.779
of the Lord's evening meal, we will commemorate, remember, the two greatest acts of love that have

00:13:15.779 --> 00:13:25.139
ever been shown that make our wonderful hope possible. But now, let's ask Brother Robert Lucioni

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:35.250
to read the Watchtower comments on our scripture for today. How does a person know that he or she

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:41.889
has the heavenly calling? The answer is clearly seen in the Apostle Paul's words to those in Rome

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:47.649
who were called to be holy ones. In addition to the words of today's text, he told them,

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:55.570
you did not receive a spirit of slavery causing fear again, but you received a spirit of adoption

00:13:55.570 --> 00:14:02.850
as sons, by which spirit we cry out, Abba, Father. So by means of his Holy Spirit,

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:10.370
God makes it clear to anointed ones that they have this heavenly calling. Jehovah leaves no doubt

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:15.649
whatsoever in the minds and hearts of those who receive his invitation to go to heaven.

00:14:16.929 --> 00:14:21.730
Anointed Christians do not need anyone to confirm that they are anointed.

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:31.059
Thank you very much, Rob. Now, we look forward to our memorial Bible reading for today.

00:14:32.019 --> 00:14:37.460
We will have the daytime events of Nysan 13 read from Luke 22 and Mark 14,

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:44.820
then the events after sundown which would have been Nysan 14 will be read from the latter part of

00:14:44.820 --> 00:15:01.840
Luke 22. The specific text will appear on screen in your own language. The day of the unleavened

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:09.840
bread now arrived on which the Passover sacrifice must be offered. So Jesus sent Peter and John

00:15:09.919 --> 00:15:15.840
saying, go and get the Passover ready for us to eat. They said to him,

00:15:16.639 --> 00:15:22.960
where do you want us to get it ready? He said to them, look, when you enter into the city,

00:15:23.519 --> 00:15:30.159
a man carrying an earthenware water jar will meet you. Follow him into the house that he enters

00:15:30.159 --> 00:15:36.639
and say to the landlord of the house, the teacher says to you, where is the guest room where

00:15:36.639 --> 00:15:44.159
I may eat the Passover with my disciples. And that man will show you a large furnished upper room.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:51.919
Get it ready there. So they left and found it just as he had told them, and they prepared for the

00:15:51.919 --> 00:16:07.279
Passover. Now, on the first day of the unleavened bread, when they customarily offered up the Passover

00:16:07.279 --> 00:16:13.679
sacrifice, his disciples said to him, where do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the

00:16:13.679 --> 00:16:22.639
Passover? With that, he sent two of his disciples and said to them, go into the city and a man

00:16:22.639 --> 00:16:30.080
carrying an earthenware water jar will meet you. Follow him and wherever he goes inside, say to

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:36.399
the master of the house, the teacher says, where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover

00:16:36.399 --> 00:16:44.240
with my disciples. And he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready. Prepare it for us

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:52.480
there. So the disciples went out and they entered the city and found it just as he said to them,

00:16:52.480 --> 00:17:07.599
and they prepared for the Passover. So when the hour came, he reclined at the table along with the

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:15.279
apostles, and he said to them, I have greatly desired to eat this Passover with you before I

00:17:15.279 --> 00:17:22.480
suffer. For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.

00:17:23.759 --> 00:17:31.119
And accepting a cup, he gave thanks and said, take this, and pass it from one to the other

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:38.319
among yourselves. For I tell you, from now on, I will not drink again from the product of the vine

00:17:38.319 --> 00:17:48.079
until the kingdom of God comes. Also, he took a loaf, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to them,

00:17:48.799 --> 00:17:57.920
saying, this means my body, which is to be given in your behalf. Keep doing this in remembrance of me.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:07.440
Also, he did the same with the cup, after they had the evening meal, saying, this cup means the

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:16.400
new covenant by virtue of my blood, which is to be poured out in your behalf. But look, the hand

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:24.240
of my betrayer is with me at the table. For indeed, the son of man is going his way according to

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:31.279
what has been determined, all the same, woe to that man through whom he is betrayed.

00:18:32.559 --> 00:18:38.319
So they began to discuss among themselves which one of them could really be about to do this.

00:18:39.759 --> 00:18:46.400
However, there also arose a heated dispute among them over which one of them was considered

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:52.960
to be the greatest. But he said to them, the kings of the nations lured it over them,

00:18:52.960 --> 00:19:00.400
and those having authority over them are called benefactors. You, though, are not to be that way.

00:19:01.039 --> 00:19:07.920
But let the one who is the greatest among you become as the youngest, and the one taking the lead

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:14.240
as the one ministering. For which one is greater, the one dining, or the one serving?

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:20.640
Is it not the one dining? But I am among you as the one serving.

00:19:21.359 --> 00:19:29.119
However, you are the ones who have stuck with me in my trials, and I make a covenant with you

00:19:29.759 --> 00:19:36.799
just as my father has made a covenant with me for a kingdom, so that you may eat and drink at my

00:19:36.799 --> 00:19:46.480
table in my kingdom and sit on thrones to judge the twelve tribes of Israel. Simon, Simon, look,

00:19:47.359 --> 00:19:55.359
Satan has demanded to have all of you to sift you as wheat, but I have made supplication for you

00:19:55.359 --> 00:20:02.400
that your faith may not give out, and you, once you have returned, strengthen your brothers.

00:20:03.599 --> 00:20:09.519
Then he said to him, Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:20.880
But he said, I tell you, Peter, a rooster will not crow today until you have denied knowing me three times.

00:20:22.319 --> 00:20:29.119
He also said to them, when I sent you out without a money bag and a food pouch and sandals,

00:20:29.839 --> 00:20:36.960
you did not lack anything, did you? They said, no. Then he said to them,

00:20:37.599 --> 00:20:45.519
but now let the one who has a money bag take it, likewise a food pouch, and let the one who has no

00:20:45.519 --> 00:20:52.240
sword sell his outer garment and buy one. For I tell you that what is written must be accomplished

00:20:52.240 --> 00:21:00.079
in me, namely, he was counted with lawless ones, for this is being fulfilled concerning me.

00:21:00.319 --> 00:21:08.400
Then they said, Lord, look, here are two swords. He said to them, it is enough.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:17.279
On leaving, he went as was his custom to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples also followed him.

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:26.559
On arriving at the place, he said to them, carry on prayer so that you do not enter into temptation.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:34.640
And he withdrew from them about a stone straw away, and he bent his knees and began to pray,

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:47.519
saying, Father, if you want to remove this cup from me, nevertheless, let not my will, but yours take

00:21:47.599 --> 00:21:56.880
place. Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him, but he was in such agony

00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:04.160
that he kept praying more earnestly, and his sweat became his drops of blood falling to the ground.

00:22:05.519 --> 00:22:12.319
When he rose from prayer and went to the disciples, he found them slumbering, exhausted from grief.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:21.359
He said to them, why are you sleeping? Get up and keep praying so that you do not enter into

00:22:21.359 --> 00:22:32.559
temptation. While he was still speaking, look, a crowd, and the man called Judas, one of the 12

00:22:32.559 --> 00:22:41.279
was leading them, and he approached Jesus to kiss him. But Jesus said to him, Judas, are you

00:22:41.279 --> 00:22:47.680
betraying the Son of man with a kiss? When those around him saw what was going to happen,

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:55.599
they said, Lord, should we strike with the sword? One of them even struck the slave of the high

00:22:55.599 --> 00:23:05.759
priest, taking off his right ear. But in reply, Jesus said, that is enough, and he touched the ear

00:23:05.839 --> 00:23:12.799
and healed him. Jesus then said to the chief priests and captains of the temple, and elders

00:23:12.799 --> 00:23:18.960
who had come there for him, did you come out with swords and clubs as against a robber?

00:23:19.839 --> 00:23:24.960
While I was with you in the temple day after day, you did not lay your hands on me,

00:23:25.599 --> 00:23:32.960
but this is your hour and the authority of darkness. Then they arrested him and led him off,

00:23:33.599 --> 00:23:39.519
and they brought him into the house of the high priest. But Peter was following at a distance.

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:46.240
When they lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter was sitting

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:53.440
among them. But a servant girl, seeing him sitting in the light of the fire, looked closely at him,

00:23:54.079 --> 00:24:00.640
and said, this man was also with him. But he denied it, saying,

00:24:01.359 --> 00:24:07.759
I do not know him, woman. After a short time, another person saw him and said,

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:17.759
you two are one of them. But Peter said, man, I am not. And after about an hour had passed,

00:24:17.759 --> 00:24:26.240
another man began insisting strongly. Certainly, this man was also with him, for he is, in fact,

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:32.799
a Galilean. But Peter said, man, I do not know what you are saying.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:42.720
And instantly, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed. At this, the Lord turned and looked

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:48.400
straight at Peter, and Peter recalled the statement of the Lord when he had said to him,

00:24:49.119 --> 00:24:58.319
before a rooster crowed today, you will disown me three times. And he went outside, and wept bitterly.

00:25:00.079 --> 00:25:06.640
Now the men who held Jesus in custody began to mock him, hitting him, and after covering his face,

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:07.680
they kept asking,

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:15.839
prophesy, who is it that struck you? And they said many other blasphemous things against him.

00:25:18.579 --> 00:25:26.980
Well, it has truly been a delight to speak today with millions of you dear ones around the world.

00:25:27.779 --> 00:25:36.500
You precious sheep in Jehovah's flock. Be assured we love you all very, very much.

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:43.460
And may Jehovah be with all of us this evening, as we gather together physically if possible.

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:52.339
But especially, as we all gather to gather in spirit, to commemorate the most important event of

00:25:52.339 --> 00:26:03.299
the year, the memorial of Christ's death, which is an incomparable gift from our Father, Jehovah.
