00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:10.990
Welcome to our program. This month's theme is, are you paying attention?

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:22.070
Strange relationships, illnesses, careers, entertainment. We'll learn how to stay

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:28.469
focused on Jehovah despite these potential distractions. We'll see how our

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:35.390
ministry is more effective when we focus on reaching the hearts of people. And our

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.590
new saw was written especially for you young adults to help you keep your eyes

00:00:41.590 --> 00:01:09.689
on the prize of life. This is JW Broadcasting for November 2020. Are you paying

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.730
attention? Perhaps you've been asked that question by your parents, a teacher,

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:21.890
or someone else in authority. It's a good question for each of us to ask our

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.730
selves. Can you think of occasions associated with our worship that require us

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:36.409
to pay special attention? For example, when reading the Bible, attending meetings,

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:43.609
elders when shepherding, you children when being instructed by your parents. We

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:50.329
want to pay attention and yet there are so many distractions, electronic gadgets,

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:56.569
the conversations and activities of those around us. Truly, it can be a

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:03.810
challenge to pay attention. Did you know that the phrase pay attention occurs

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.569
dozens of times in the New World Translation? In many of those occurrences,

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:17.210
Jehovah is instructing his people to pay attention. What does it mean to pay

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:25.409
attention? And how important is it that you and I pay attention to Jehovah? The

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:32.409
account in 1 Samuel chapter 15 will help us to answer those questions. In verse

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:39.090
3, Jehovah instructs King Saul to strike down the Amalakites and to devote them

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:47.129
and everything they have to destruction. However, verses 8 and 9 tell us that

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:55.530
Saul did not obey. He spared the King of Amalak and the best of the animals.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:05.009
How did Saul respond when Samuel confronted him? As we read verses 13 through 15,

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:13.449
note how Saul tried to justify his disobedience. When Samuel finally came to

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:22.009
him, Saul said to him, May Jehovah bless you. I have carried out the word of Jehovah.

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:29.210
But Samuel said, Then what is this sound of the flock in my ears and the sound of

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:35.569
the cattle that I hear? To this Saul said, They were brought from the Amalakites

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:41.849
because the people spared the best of the flock and the herd for sacrificing them

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:50.930
to Jehovah, your God. But what was left? We devoted to destruction. Did you notice?

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:57.930
Saul attempted to justify his disobedience claiming that the animals would be

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:06.849
sacrificed to Jehovah. Was Jehovah pleased with Saul? As we read verse 22,

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:16.209
please note the connection between paying attention and obedience. Samuel then said,

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:25.250
Does Jehovah take as much pleasure in bird offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:35.649
Jehovah? Look, to obey is better than a sacrifice and to pay attention than the fat of

00:04:35.649 --> 00:04:44.209
grams. What was one of the causes of Saul's disobedience? He didn't pay attention to Jehovah's

00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:51.889
instructions. His failure to pay attention resulted in disobedience and brought Jehovah's

00:04:51.889 --> 00:05:00.329
disapproval. What a powerful lesson for us. As happened with Saul, our worship could

00:05:00.329 --> 00:05:09.610
become unacceptable to Jehovah if we fail to pay attention. Now that we understand why

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:16.329
it is important to pay attention, let's consider three aspects of paying attention that are

00:05:16.329 --> 00:05:23.889
discussed in the Bible. The first scripture will consider is 2nd Chronicles chapter 19,

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:35.100
verse 6. And he, that is, Jehoshaphat, said to the judges, pay attention to what you are

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:43.939
doing for you to not judge for man, but for Jehovah. And he is with you when you pass judgment.

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:53.810
This admonition to pay attention was given by King Jehoshaphat to appoint a judges throughout

00:05:53.810 --> 00:06:03.089
the land of Judah. What a sobering reminder. Those judges had good reason to pay attention to what

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:12.930
they were doing. Why? They were responsible to Jehovah. They represented him and their decisions

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:19.649
affected the lives of fellow worshipers. Thus, they needed to be familiar with Jehovah's thinking

00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:27.649
on matters and to hold to his unprejudiced viewpoint when handling matters. This is an excellent

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:34.930
reminder for those who serve as elders. Good elders are good students of the Bible and Bible-based

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:44.050
publications. Why? Their attentiveness to Jehovah enables them to pay attention to what they

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:51.170
are doing. If they are going to represent Jehovah and reflect his thinking accurately as they

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:57.009
handle matters, whether they are shepherding the congregation, delivering a part at a meeting,

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:05.250
caring for a challenging assignment, or addressing wrongdoing, they must pay attention to what

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:11.970
they are doing. That is why they must be familiar with Jehovah's thinking and then take care to

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:19.410
follow his direction. If they do, they show that they are paying attention to what they are doing.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:27.649
Jehovah's interest in assisting the elders is demonstrated in the ongoing education he provides.

00:07:28.689 --> 00:07:34.610
Each time the circuit overseer visits the congregation, he presents material prepared

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:41.889
especially for the elders, the Kingdom Ministry school, and the school for congregation elders

00:07:41.889 --> 00:07:48.769
provide more intensive instruction. How important that elders pay close attention to

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:58.370
and apply such instruction. They are doing so protect not just themselves, but also fellow worshipers.

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:04.930
By paying attention, elders will be able to convey direction to the congregations

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:13.329
accurately. This can be especially important if our worship is banned or restricted in the event

00:08:13.569 --> 00:08:21.970
of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event. This brings us to the second aspect of paying attention

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:27.649
that we'll consider. Let's read Luke chapter 8 verse 18.

00:08:29.569 --> 00:08:37.889
Therefore, pay attention to how you listen for whoever has will be given more,

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:45.090
but whoever does not have, even what he imagines he has will be taken away from him.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:53.220
What did Jesus mean when he said, pay attention to how you listen?

00:08:54.659 --> 00:09:00.500
Those in Jesus' audience in the first century had the wonderful privilege of hearing Jesus'

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:08.100
literal voice as he instructed them. Of course, we can't hear the voice of Jesus today,

00:09:09.059 --> 00:09:15.059
but we can read his words and learn of his actions as revealed in the gospel accounts.

00:09:16.259 --> 00:09:25.059
In fact, we have many opportunities to listen, to Jehovah, Jesus, the faithful and discrete slave,

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:31.620
the elders in our congregation, our marriagemate, our children.

00:09:32.179 --> 00:09:39.220
No wonder the Bible writer James stated that everyone must be quick to listen.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:47.860
Think about it. If Saul had truly listened receptively to Jehovah's direction regarding the Amalakites,

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:54.179
he would likely have grasped the importance of the direction he received and would have been

00:09:54.179 --> 00:10:03.620
motivated to obey. However, his lack of attentiveness led to disobedience and Jehovah's disapproval.

00:10:05.379 --> 00:10:11.059
If we don't pay attention to how we listen, we could find ourselves becoming critical,

00:10:11.779 --> 00:10:20.100
or unappreciative, or even disobedient. So as Jehovah instructs and directs us,

00:10:21.059 --> 00:10:25.860
we need to think about what we are being told, ponder over its meaning,

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:33.539
mallet over in our mind, and most important, apply the instruction in our own lives.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:42.100
If you're a young person, how can you show that you're paying attention to how you listen?

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:48.740
Consider the admonition in Ephesians chapter 6, verses 1 through 3.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:57.299
Children, be obedient to your parents and union with the Lord, for this is righteous.

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:03.139
On her, your father and your mother, is the first command with the promise

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:12.429
that it may go well with you, and you may remain a long time on the earth. You children,

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:16.190
who do you think is the source of this direction?

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:24.909
We know that these words come from Jehovah. Did you notice that the verses state not only that

00:11:24.909 --> 00:11:33.070
children should be obedient to their parents, but also that they should honor their parents?

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:40.269
How can you show that you're paying attention to how you listen to this direction?

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:47.309
When I was a boy, I can remember occasions when my parents would ask me to do something,

00:11:48.029 --> 00:11:56.590
perhaps to take out the trash. I would always obey, but at times I'd make it very clear

00:11:56.590 --> 00:12:03.070
that I didn't really want to do what was asked. I think you young ones know what I mean.

00:12:05.149 --> 00:12:10.750
However, if we're truly paying attention to how we listen to Jehovah's words,

00:12:11.789 --> 00:12:17.950
we'll be careful to honor our parents, which is an essential element of obedience.

00:12:19.309 --> 00:12:26.909
In this way, we contribute to the peace of the family, and we make Jehovah's heart glad.

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:34.190
Additionally, as the promise in verse 3 indicates, paying attention to how you listen

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:41.070
will protect you and contribute to your success in other ways throughout your adult life.

00:12:42.509 --> 00:12:49.309
Of course, all of us should remember that our everlasting welfare will depend on our willingness

00:12:49.309 --> 00:12:58.509
to listen and obey. How important, then, that all of us pay attention to how we listen.

00:13:00.029 --> 00:13:08.029
The third aspect of paying attention is found at Luke chapter 21, verses 34 and 35,

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:19.259
but pay attention to your selves, that your hearts never become weighed down with overeating and heavy

00:13:19.259 --> 00:13:27.580
drinking, and anxieties of life, and suddenly that day be instantly upon you as a snare.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:34.720
When Jesus had managed his followers to pay attention to themselves,

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:39.919
he didn't have in mind the selfish thinking that characterized King Saul,

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:44.799
and that so common even encouraged in today's world.

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:53.360
Rather, Jesus' words reveal that the key to paying attention to ourselves is knowing ourselves,

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:59.919
knowing what's in our figurative heart. This is a challenge for all of us.

00:14:00.879 --> 00:14:06.159
Why? The Bible explains in Jeremiah chapter 17, verse 9,

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:12.159
when the heart is more treacherous than anything else and is desperate.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:18.000
Who can know it? Verse 10 answers,

00:14:19.279 --> 00:14:24.399
I Jehovah am searching the heart, examining the innermost thoughts.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:31.759
So Jehovah knows what is in our heart, and he can help us to know.

00:14:32.159 --> 00:14:39.759
He can help us to examine our motives and goal holds, and to discern why we do certain things.

00:14:41.039 --> 00:14:45.600
Carefully and honestly, looking at ourselves in the mirror of God's word,

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:51.759
can reveal areas in our thinking, words, and actions that need attention.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:58.480
For example, some of Jehovah's people, including those of retirement age,

00:14:58.559 --> 00:15:04.720
who enjoyed very comfortable circumstances, have concluded that they needed to make adjustments

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:11.120
in their lifestyle, simplifying their lives so that they can serve Jehovah more fully.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:17.840
Some who have done so have had the privilege of attending the school for Kingdom of Angelizers.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:25.200
Although it meant stepping out of their comfort zone, perhaps moving to a new congregation,

00:15:26.159 --> 00:15:30.799
they've experienced Jehovah's blessing in ways they couldn't have anticipated,

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:37.919
as they share the benefits of their experience and theocratic education in their new assignments.

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:48.559
How grateful we are that Jehovah is providing ongoing life-saving instruction by means of his word and organization.

00:15:49.759 --> 00:15:54.639
May each of us be determined to pay attention to what we are doing.

00:15:55.679 --> 00:16:05.440
To how we listen and to ourselves. By doing so, we'll avoid falling into the trap of disobedience

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:14.480
as King Saul did. Instead, as attentive and obedient servants, we'll enjoy Jehovah's friendship

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:22.399
forever. Elders play an important role in helping us stay focused on Jehovah,

00:16:23.039 --> 00:16:26.320
particularly when we're facing difficult problems.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:32.480
And our first video, notice how elders provide loving assistance.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.759
Everything was going fine in my marriage, also I thought.

00:16:39.519 --> 00:16:46.159
My ex-husband was disfellowshipped, left home, and in less than a month we divorced.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:55.679
Right after the divorce, I had to figure out how I would provide for the girls.

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:07.420
And so I began working as a cleaner. I also had to provide for them spiritually,

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:16.769
but many times, because of discouragement and tiredness, I couldn't be there for them

00:17:16.769 --> 00:17:25.549
as much as they needed me to be. Besides all of this, I also had to deal with very negative feelings.

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:29.309
It was a very difficult time in my life.

00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:42.509
I had never been so sick. I couldn't even get up to go to the hospital.

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:52.750
To cope with this problem, I just kept praying. I was not able to walk and I was not able to

00:17:52.750 --> 00:18:00.900
get to the meetings. The elders realized that I was missing from the meetings.

00:18:06.579 --> 00:18:15.519
The elders quickly came to my aid. I remember that one of the things that touched me the most

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:22.720
was when the elders read the scripture. Some under and thirty-nine were three.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:30.640
You observe me when I travel and when I lie down. You are familiar with all my ways.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:38.640
I realized that I am precious to Jehovah. It was as if Jehovah was healing me.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:43.519
I now knew that Jehovah was interested in me and that he was looking after me.

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:50.000
He was making sure that I knew it. Something else that I remember fondly

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:56.559
was after a meeting at the Kinamo. One of the elders gave me some scriptures to read at home

00:18:57.519 --> 00:19:02.160
and said that if we needed any help, the elders were there for us.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:10.240
Two elders lovingly came to see me because Jehovah uses them as shepherds.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:20.099
I lived very far from the Kingdom home but the brothers made the sacrifice to get public transport,

00:19:20.099 --> 00:19:24.980
get off at the main road and from there they walked 40 minutes to reach my house.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:33.380
I don't know what I would have done. When the elders arrived, they listened to me.

00:19:34.339 --> 00:19:42.210
They cried with me and they read the Bible. Jehovah loves me.

00:19:42.769 --> 00:19:52.319
When I started to feel better, I went back to the Greek. I was really happy to be back with my brothers.

00:19:58.319 --> 00:20:04.799
Now, after all the help we have received, we are doing well. The congregation is our second home

00:20:05.359 --> 00:20:13.140
and we feel very good there. Everything I have today, I owe to the brothers and sisters,

00:20:13.779 --> 00:20:20.980
especially the elders. I see shepherding calls as a very evident way in which Jehovah

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:29.539
demonstrates his full love for us. I understand at times that these visits might be a challenge for

00:20:29.539 --> 00:20:36.339
the elders but the results are really good. Without a doubt, they can see that all the work and

00:20:36.339 --> 00:20:42.420
all the effort is worthwhile. I will never forget the help I received from the elders.

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:48.660
This situation taught me that Jehovah will not let his sheep get lost, not even one.

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:56.579
During my 23 verse 4 says, and I will raise up over them shepherds who will really shepherd them.

00:20:56.579 --> 00:21:02.579
They will no longer be afraid or be terrified and none will be missing. Declare is Jehovah.

00:21:04.539 --> 00:21:12.859
How did the elders help Mariana and Alias? As good shepherds, they were attentive to Jehovah's flock,

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:19.420
so they were quick to notice that help was needed. They visited Mariana and Alias in their

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:29.259
homes, shared encouraging scriptures, and listened. They showed that Jehovah cares for every one of his sheep.

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:37.180
Those brothers, like the elders in your congregation, paid attention to the loving training and

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:45.700
instruction they'd received from Jehovah. To expand their ministry, many witnesses have learned

00:21:45.779 --> 00:21:54.819
another language. Have you? If so, Jehovah knows your selfless effort and hard work to preach and

00:21:54.819 --> 00:22:02.579
teach in that language. But as preaching to people in their native language, sufficient to reach

00:22:02.579 --> 00:22:12.910
their heart. Let's see in this dramatization. Our family had been learning Chinese for over a year.

00:22:13.789 --> 00:22:20.589
It wasn't easy. God has many titles. Did you know he has only one name?

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:49.819
I was ready, or at least I thought so. Yeah, I'll be right there. We were making progress.

00:22:50.619 --> 00:23:23.619
And we weren't giving up. It seemed like most people just weren't interested. We were not having a

00:23:23.619 --> 00:23:38.099
good morning. What happened? Mom and Liz weren't having a good morning either.

00:23:42.539 --> 00:23:46.619
Brother and sister Lynn joined us. They've been a big help to us.

00:23:48.539 --> 00:23:54.539
We told them about our morning. We were finally able to converse a little and give presentations,

00:23:54.539 --> 00:24:03.180
but everything seemed to fall flat. You ask good questions at a door, but not always the right one.

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:09.500
See, when you learn the language, do not forget to learn about people.

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:18.369
He was right. Our questions started conversations in our old territory, but not here.

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:27.250
The pulsation is very good. Thanks, Berlin. We needed a different approach, where we didn't just

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:35.619
learn the language, but also how to reach the heart of someone who speaks it. In the July 2019

00:24:35.619 --> 00:24:39.619
watch tower, we read about reaching the hearts of non-religious people.

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:52.339
Well, Paul was a Jew, but when he was talking to other people, he had to adapt his presentation.

00:24:52.339 --> 00:24:59.859
I like what First Corinthians 9, 20 through 23 says. To the Jews, I became a Jew in order to gain

00:25:00.339 --> 00:25:07.380
Jews to those in your law. Liz was right. When Paul spoke to fellow Jews and Athens,

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:12.819
he reasoned from the scriptures. But when he spoke to the Greeks at the Ariapagus,

00:25:12.819 --> 00:25:17.859
he adapted, reasoning with them first without the Bible. He later wrote,

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:26.099
I have become all things to people of all sorts, so that I might by all possible means save some.

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:32.579
That's what we needed to do. We learned more about the people.

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:42.849
We started to listen more and talk about things that interested them.

00:25:49.789 --> 00:26:02.829
We found different ways to start conversations, and we kept learning more about the culture.

00:26:03.869 --> 00:26:08.910
Part of a Chinese proverb I found says, he who comes near ink is stained black.

00:26:09.869 --> 00:26:17.230
It's been a great way to introduce Proverbs 13-20. The one walking with the wise will become wise.

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:51.869
It all comes down to showing love. The more we pay attention to how we were teaching,

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:57.069
the more we were able to show people the God who loves them.

00:27:03.099 --> 00:27:08.460
What a beautiful reminder that in the ministry, we want to pay attention to people,

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:17.099
to what interests them, to what helps them. And as we saw, we may need to analyze and adapt

00:27:17.099 --> 00:27:25.039
our teaching methods, just as Paul did. Even as we endeavour to reach the hearts of people in the

00:27:25.039 --> 00:27:33.839
ministry, we must safeguard our own heart. A recent watchtower article offered practical suggestions

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:41.119
to help us do that. In our next video, notice how our brothers benefited from applying what they

00:27:41.119 --> 00:28:03.539
learned. Very good friends of ours decided they wanted to go their own way and leave Jehovah,

00:28:03.539 --> 00:28:10.819
and in that interim they became bad association for us. We had many good times together. We drove

00:28:10.819 --> 00:28:17.059
to isolated territory together. We even visited a brother who was sick in hospital to encourage him.

00:28:20.099 --> 00:28:23.700
I feel heartbroken that they're no longer serving Jehovah.

00:28:24.259 --> 00:28:27.220
It's really hard to live a friend's virtually, very hard.

00:28:28.099 --> 00:28:33.460
I was about to enter full-time service, but I still knew the adherence.

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:41.059
I was raised by my mother as a witness, even though I had very little contact with my father.

00:28:41.059 --> 00:28:47.140
He still tried to oppose my spiritual progress. I kept fighting for the truth, and I got baptized

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:55.380
when I was 11. I guess I felt like I was doing okay, and after high school, I went to university.

00:28:56.660 --> 00:29:04.740
I had to make some changes in my choice of entertainment. We really never stop learning.

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:13.539
I do enjoy relaxing and watching television, but I must admit that it is more and more difficult

00:29:13.539 --> 00:29:20.099
to find something decent to watch these days. Well, I'm not saying that I watch bad programs.

00:29:20.099 --> 00:29:27.940
I would never do that. But still, I wonder if what I watch is spiritually healthy for me.

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:38.980
The way of thinking I was exposed to in university was pressuring me to find security in my life

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:47.900
through material things. My government own place to live, economic stability, but at what cost?

00:29:52.349 --> 00:29:58.589
I remember that paragraph. It said that Satan promotes making money as the only way you could

00:29:58.589 --> 00:30:05.069
find security in this world. But one could sacrifice so much to achieve it. You could even use

00:30:05.069 --> 00:30:12.349
your friendship with Jehovah. That article, it was just what we needed. It described a watchman

00:30:12.349 --> 00:30:19.309
that would protect the city by sounding out an alarm on impending danger. And at sounding that

00:30:19.309 --> 00:30:24.589
alarm, he would shut the gates to the city to protect the city. And I needed to do that.

00:30:25.869 --> 00:30:33.630
We both needed to do that. And it's not even a question. Our loyalty to Jehovah comes first

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:43.410
before we loyal to any friends we have in this world. The watchtower said that storytelling

00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:51.089
has more than entertainers. In Barna, the city of Cameroon, where I was born.

00:30:52.369 --> 00:30:55.809
Mother spent the evenings with their children telling them stories.

00:30:57.569 --> 00:31:04.690
And even though I was young, the stories my mother told me continued to influence me even today.

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:13.730
So I said to myself, oh no, wait a minute happy. It means that the stories that I watch on television

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:21.890
will also affect me sooner or later. And the devil knows that too. So I decided to completely

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:30.210
cut out the number of programs that I used to watch. Now I'm serving in full-time service and I love

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:37.170
it. Jehovah is really taking care of me. But I don't want to forget the beautiful principles

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:44.529
I've learned from the article. I still have to say I've got my heart. I want to give my best to

00:31:44.529 --> 00:31:51.569
my father, Jehovah. A lot of day goes by. We don't think about these friends of ours. And it's

00:31:51.569 --> 00:31:57.009
certainly our hope that they come back to Jehovah. That we can serve Jehovah together, shoulder to shoulder.

00:31:57.009 --> 00:32:03.410
But we also learned to keep our little watchguard in check. He needs to make sure he does his job

00:32:03.410 --> 00:32:12.450
and sound alarm and shut those gates. We never stop learning. Well, true, it's easier said than

00:32:13.089 --> 00:32:18.930
but it's up to us. It's so important to safeguard your heart.

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:37.710
We all enjoy reading the watchtower and commenting at the Watchtower study.

00:32:38.509 --> 00:32:43.309
The truly paying attention means putting what we learn into action.

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:51.470
What else goes into being a discerning student? That was the topic of a recent morning

00:32:51.549 --> 00:32:54.910
worship program presented by Brother Joel Dalinger.

00:32:56.349 --> 00:33:02.190
Our focus in the Watchtower study article is on how we can unleash the power of God's word

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:09.069
when teaching from the platform. But you know whether we're teaching in a congregation setting

00:33:09.069 --> 00:33:14.910
on a Bible study or in the family isn't it true that all of us, brothers and sisters,

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:20.829
need to pay constant attention to ourselves and to our teaching. And we know why that's so important.

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:28.829
Because lives are at stake. And all of us, younger or older, touch the lives of other people.

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:36.430
So when we teach effectively, we are giving opportunity to others to detain the wisdom and the

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:42.430
discernment that God's word can give them. That's why we need to approach any teaching opportunity

00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:49.710
seriously and prayerfully. You know, over 20 years ago, a kind elder gave me some constructive

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:56.430
counsel after a public talk. And then with a warm smile, he said this, remember, none of us

00:33:56.430 --> 00:34:04.509
teach like Jesus did. Well, I'll never forget that counsel. Why were those observations so helpful?

00:34:05.309 --> 00:34:12.110
Well, it reminded me that when teaching, our model needs to be Jesus, the great teacher.

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:17.949
There's more to learn from him. And Jesus example reminds us of the need to remain humble

00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:23.630
and diligent students of Jehovah, the grand instructor.

00:34:24.909 --> 00:34:32.269
Though all of us are teachers on occasion, isn't it true that most often the role we play during

00:34:32.269 --> 00:34:41.710
spiritual programs is that of students? Just for a moment, think about the many hours we spend as

00:34:41.789 --> 00:34:48.429
students, not teachers, when we're in the audience at congregation meetings, at assemblies and

00:34:48.429 --> 00:34:56.190
conventions. Add to that the time we are students when we buy out time to watch the monthly broadcast,

00:34:56.909 --> 00:35:02.670
to prepare for meetings, to engage in family and personal study. And then think of the added

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:10.269
privilege that many of us here have to enjoy morning worship five days a week. You know, a typical

00:35:10.269 --> 00:35:16.190
program of morning worship lasts between 20 to 25 minutes. If you multiply that by five days a

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:26.110
week and then by 52 weeks, at a minimum, we are exposed to at least 86 hours of divine instruction

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:33.789
each year. But if we're not careful, some or much of that valuable instruction, encouragement

00:35:33.789 --> 00:35:40.030
and counsel could just wash over us. So for the remaining time for our program this morning,

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:46.909
let's consider some things all of us can do to listen more effectively at spiritual programs.

00:35:47.869 --> 00:35:54.670
Please, for our first point, open your Bible to Ezra, chapter 7 and verse 10. And let's consider

00:35:54.670 --> 00:36:02.590
Ezra's example. Let's Ezra, chapter 7 and verse 10. And notice the reading carefully.

00:36:03.389 --> 00:36:12.750
Ezra had prepared his heart to consult the law of Jehovah and to practice it and to teach its

00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:21.309
regulations and judgments in Israel. Now, if you have the Bible with the asterisk next to prepared his

00:36:21.309 --> 00:36:28.349
heart, if you tap on that, you'll notice that that could be rendered as had determined in his heart.

00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:34.989
Well, what do we learn from Ezra? He had the right attitude going in to a period of study.

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:42.269
He had the right approach to study and learning. He recognized that it was Jehovah who would be

00:36:42.269 --> 00:36:49.150
teaching him through his law. And as the verse goes on to say, he first recognized that he needed

00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:56.190
to personally practice what he was learning. Only then would he be in a rightful position to

00:36:56.190 --> 00:37:01.710
effectively teach others. Well, this scripture emphasizes the point we've already made,

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:10.190
doesn't it? Though we are teachers on occasion, we are always first and foremost students of God's

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:18.670
Word. How can we imitate Ezra's example and prepare our hearts before study, before attending

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:24.429
a spiritual program, whether here at Bethel or in the congregation, before watching a monthly

00:37:24.429 --> 00:37:32.909
broadcast? Well, we need to prepare our hearts by specifically praying to Jehovah, recognizing him

00:37:32.909 --> 00:37:39.550
as the source of the teaching. What should we pray specifically about? Well, for one,

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:45.949
we want to pray that we remain humble while listening to theocratic instruction.

00:37:46.829 --> 00:37:53.550
We need to listen no matter how long we've been in Jehovah's classroom because none of us knows

00:37:53.630 --> 00:38:00.909
it all, nor will we ever know it all. Proverbs chapter 1 and verse 5 reminds us that a wise person

00:38:00.909 --> 00:38:07.949
listens and takes in more instruction. Well, this leads to another question. What if we find we have a

00:38:07.949 --> 00:38:14.829
somewhat negative attitude toward a certain presentation, perhaps the material doesn't interest us,

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:22.269
or we have a negative attitude toward a certain brother and his teaching ability? What should we do?

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:31.710
Prepare our heart. Pray to Jehovah to recognize and appreciate that the instruction is from him.

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:39.469
Pray to have a thankful spirit. You know, back in 2002, the watchtower made this helpful point

00:38:39.469 --> 00:38:43.469
in an article that was entitled, pay more than the usual attention. I quote,

00:38:44.829 --> 00:38:49.469
some may tend to gauge the quality of a meeting by the teaching abilities of the participants.

00:38:50.269 --> 00:38:55.949
Though the teaching ability of participants is important, it is not the sole factor contributing to a

00:38:55.949 --> 00:39:02.190
meeting's success. Do you not agree that our prime concern should be not how well the speaker

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:10.670
delivers his talk, but how well we incline our ear? When we attend meetings, the article continues,

00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:15.550
and pay attention to what is being presented, we are worshiping God in harmony with his will.

00:39:16.269 --> 00:39:21.710
That is what makes the meeting a success. If we are eager to take in the knowledge of God,

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:28.750
we will benefit from meetings regardless of a speaker's abilities. What a beautiful reminder

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:37.389
for all of us. So our first point, like Ezra, let's prepare our hearts with prayer as students who

00:39:37.389 --> 00:39:45.389
are determined to always accept and apply what Jehovah has to teach us. Let's consider a second

00:39:46.349 --> 00:39:52.750
point. The need to focus our attention. Have you faced the challenge of staying focused during

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:59.869
spiritual programs? Our minds may be distracted with anxieties and many other things.

00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:06.829
Noise and movements around us could distract us. If we're watching morning worship at a location

00:40:06.829 --> 00:40:13.550
other than the Bethel dining room, likely we now well know the numerous distractions that fight for

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:19.070
our attention. Some of us have ailments and physical discomforts that may make it difficult to

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:26.510
concentrate. Recently, a sister in our congregation told us about her long-term battle with migraine

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:33.710
headaches. I tried to put myself in her shoes having a migraine headache while attending a spiritual

00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:40.030
program. Difficult to concentrate. Well, whatever the case may be, we know we admit that there are

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:46.510
many challenges and distractions. What can we do about it? Well, since the eyes strongly

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:53.630
influence where we focus our attention, the benefit book provides this suggestion. Use your eyes to

00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:59.469
help you concentrate by keeping them on the speaker. When he cites a Bible text, even a familiar one

00:40:59.469 --> 00:41:05.389
look it up and follow along as he reads it. And then it said this, resist the temptation to turn your

00:41:05.389 --> 00:41:12.030
head in the direction of every noise or movement. If the eyes are flooding your mind with distracting

00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:18.590
information, you will miss much of what is presented from the platform. And think about two now the

00:41:18.590 --> 00:41:27.070
use of electronic devices. Have you ever been alerted, messaged or emailed while looking at the

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:34.829
Bible on your device? How wise it is when we turn those devices into a mode that eliminates

00:41:34.909 --> 00:41:42.670
unnecessary distractions. Well, what about anxieties or disquieting thoughts? What can we do about that?

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:49.869
Well, here again is where we're remembering who the grand instructor is and how close he can be to us

00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:58.349
when we're in a teaching environment. Open, please your Bible to Psalm 94, 19. To recall what the

00:41:58.349 --> 00:42:12.530
Psalmist said to Jehovah, Psalm 94 and verse 19, we read, When anxieties overwhelm me, you,

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:21.570
Jehovah, comforted and soothed me. What a beautiful reminder. Jehovah can sooth and comfort us

00:42:21.570 --> 00:42:28.210
when attending spiritual programs so that we can focus on what he's teaching us. Yes, spiritual

00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:35.489
programs are a provision from him, a spiritual lifeline. So as needed, during a spiritual program,

00:42:35.489 --> 00:42:41.409
we should pray to Jehovah to help us stay focused. Pray repeatedly as needed.

00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:48.690
Well, in summary, what have we learned? All of us are teachers from time to time. But first and

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:56.769
foremost, we are students in the classroom of the great teacher and the grand instructor. Like Ezra,

00:42:56.769 --> 00:43:03.090
humility and appreciation should move us to prepare our hearts before every spiritual program.

00:43:03.090 --> 00:43:10.769
We don't want to miss anything that Jehovah has for us. We're determined to consult that law so

00:43:10.769 --> 00:43:16.530
that we can practice it and then teach it. And if you have all the potential distractions,

00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:23.809
let's make it our aim to use our eyes, our mind and our heart to focus attention on the goodness

00:43:23.809 --> 00:43:31.090
of Jehovah's spiritual provisions. If you are a young Christian who recently graduated from

00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:37.250
school or will soon graduate, you'll make many decisions that will affect your future.

00:43:38.769 --> 00:43:44.369
How though can you make decisions that let you successfully run the race for life?

00:43:45.329 --> 00:43:48.289
That's the subject of our new music video.

00:44:13.059 --> 00:46:58.369
For theocratic construction projects is a goal for many. Recently, thousands of brothers and sisters

00:46:58.449 --> 00:47:04.690
sacrificed their time and energy to build a beautiful new branch facility in Britain.

00:47:06.050 --> 00:47:10.690
Would you like to see the results of their hard work and the blessings they received?

00:47:11.889 --> 00:47:13.409
Please enjoy this report.

00:47:30.590 --> 00:47:35.710
And gave each and every one of us both the desire and the power to act.

00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:45.469
How has sharing on this project affected your life? It all started over seven years ago.

00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:07.250
Can you imagine how excited you're going to be when we hear that the new branch facility at

00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:14.530
Chelmsford has been approved by the City Council? Well, guess what? Yesterday afternoon, we received

00:48:14.530 --> 00:50:51.070
the approval. Whilst the buildings are beautiful, at the end of the day, they are just buildings.

00:50:51.949 --> 00:50:55.630
The really special part of this project has been the people.

00:50:57.150 --> 00:51:01.230
Even non-witnesses saw that something special was taking place on our side.

00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:07.070
It's a very friendly state to work on. It's just our friendly one. Yeah, it's just

00:51:07.070 --> 00:51:12.909
walking. I find it mind blowing. In a negative, sometimes society, when you come here,

00:51:12.909 --> 00:51:19.949
it just puts a smile on your face. A truly unexpected success was the visitor center.

00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:25.869
How we underestimated the appreciation Jehovah's people have for theocratic activities.

00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:31.949
Visitors from all around the globe witness the activities of Jehovah for themselves.

00:51:34.239 --> 00:51:40.960
This is partly why I'm actually studying the Bible to get baptized because when I came here,

00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:49.139
just hit me somewhere, you know. Me and Alicia can't see, so everyone's been so encouraging and

00:51:49.139 --> 00:51:53.699
thoughtful. We really feel like Jehovah's Jehovah's with us and he supported us.

00:51:54.980 --> 00:52:04.289
I really liked the ladies driving tractor. Everyone wanted to have a part in the project.

00:52:05.090 --> 00:52:10.210
Every single contribution warmed our hearts and sometimes our heads too.

00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:19.739
Another beautiful project highlight was the Dave volunteer program. The effort and expense

00:52:19.739 --> 00:52:25.579
brothers and sisters sacrificed reminded all of us what that privilege it is to work for Jehovah.

00:52:27.179 --> 00:52:32.780
And how about the commuters who helped on the project? Would the BRD family have had the same

00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:40.900
spirit without our commuters? Don't you just love being a part of this amazing family?

00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:50.019
We were regularly reminded that spirituality is of the utmost importance.

00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:55.619
Did you ever say that a monthly meeting was the best one yet?

00:52:56.739 --> 00:53:01.380
What lies outside the comfort zone is the faith zone.

00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:07.539
Don't cry because it's over. Smile because it happened.

00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:14.900
What is your story? The center of all of our stories is Jehovah.

00:53:15.619 --> 00:53:22.340
He is the one who energised us. He is the one who gave us both the desire and the power to act.

00:53:23.539 --> 00:53:27.219
He is the one we can thank for the lifelong friendships we have formed,

00:53:27.699 --> 00:53:31.780
the training we have received and the challenges we've been able to overcome.

00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:38.659
Remember your story. Really, it's only just beginning.

00:53:48.690 --> 00:53:54.449
In this month's program, we learned what it means to pay attention to Jehovah.

00:53:55.570 --> 00:54:00.769
We saw how we can stay focused on Jehovah despite potential distractions.

00:54:02.690 --> 00:54:08.369
Elders are good shepherds because they are attentive to Jehovah's instruction.

00:54:11.739 --> 00:54:16.860
Our ministry is more effective when we focus on reaching the hearts of people.

00:54:19.039 --> 00:54:25.119
And our new song reminds our young adults to keep their eyes on the prize of life.

00:54:27.889 --> 00:54:34.929
Before we say goodbye, let's go to the southwest tip of Japan and visit our brothers and sisters

00:54:34.929 --> 00:54:41.170
in the Ishiagaki congregation. Their territory includes the Yaiyama Islands,

00:54:41.809 --> 00:54:47.329
an archipelago of 12 islands, and more than 360 coral reefs.

00:54:48.289 --> 00:54:52.849
Emerald green waters surround these lush, jungle-covered islands.

00:54:53.730 --> 00:55:00.530
With almost no light pollution, this is an ideal place to observe Jehovah's beautiful,

00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:08.179
heavenly creation. Vast distances between the islands make the ministry a challenge.

00:55:09.139 --> 00:55:14.340
To reach remote communities, publishers take fairies and small airplanes.

00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:19.059
This is costly, and economic conditions here are uneasy.

00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:27.139
Transportation includes bicycles, as well as carts and wagons pulled by water buffalo.

00:55:29.219 --> 00:55:34.739
Public witnessing is an effective way to share the good news with the many tourists to travel here.

00:55:35.699 --> 00:55:39.300
More than one million visited during one recent year.

00:55:40.739 --> 00:55:43.780
Contact cards also produce good results.

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:53.619
The Ishiagaki congregation has 112 publishers, including 35 regular pioneerers.

00:55:53.619 --> 00:55:57.619
They're conducting more than 100 Bible studies every month.

00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:02.820
The Kingdom Hall is in Ishiagaki City on the main island.

00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:10.820
Talks from this Kingdom Hall are streamed to the small meeting place for the seven brothers and sisters

00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:18.619
who live on remote Iriamote Island. The publishers work together to maintain the Kingdom Hall.

00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:25.019
And they enjoy upbuilding association in this beautiful land.

00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:32.619
Our brothers and sisters in the Ishiagaki congregation send their warm love and greeting.

00:56:32.619 --> 00:56:39.019
From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.
