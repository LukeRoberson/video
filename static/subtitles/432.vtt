00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:07.919
What would you say is the biggest single-emotion gripping people today?

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.160
Well, many would readily agree that it's fear.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.660
Interestingly, in 1982, the book You Can Liff Forever in Paradise on Earth said this,

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.500
fear is probably the biggest single-emotion in people's lives today.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.640
And that comment by the faithful and discreet slave was based on Jesus' words

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.560
in giving us a sign about the last days.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:41.039
You know that in addition to wars, earthquakes, food shortages, and epidemics,

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:47.840
in Luke 21 and verse 11, the Bible tells us that Jesus included fearful sites

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.240
or terrifying events as indicated in the study Bible.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:59.600
At Luke 21 and verse 26, do you recall the emotion that Jesus said would overwhelm God's enemies

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:05.840
as they look ahead in the near future to seeing the sign of the Son of Man?

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.760
It would be fear.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.560
Jesus said people will become faint out of fear,

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.599
and expectation of the things coming upon the inhabited Earth.

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:20.719
Well, what about us as Jehovah's people?

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:27.040
As a group, we are nowhere nearer being faint out of fear.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.079
Nor will we be as things worsen as we approach the Great Tribulation.

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:38.400
Why not? Simply put, it's because Jehovah has prepared us

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.000
to remain calm when bad things happen in the world or in our personal lives.

00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:49.359
Think about one way Jehovah prepared us for the year 2020.

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:57.359
It was by giving us in the year 2019 the year text at Isaiah chapter 41 and verse 10.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.480
In our study of that year text last year, we were reminded that a key to not giving

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:12.159
way to fear is to meditate on the three faith-building promises contained in Isaiah 41 verse 10.

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.840
Look at it again, please, in examining the Scriptures.

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:18.240
Do you see the three promises?

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:21.360
First, Jehovah will be with us.

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.520
Second, he is our God, and third, he will help us.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.240
This morning, to illustrate the reliability of those three guarantees,

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.199
we'll consider some delightful experiences.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.960
To begin, consider, please, the experience of a sister will call Anna,

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:45.360
who is in prison for her faith.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.080
Anna's cellmate noticed that Anna was not able to reply to all the letters of encouragement

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.520
that she was receiving. When this experience was compiled last November,

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.639
do you know how many letters our sister had received?

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:09.280
More than 1,700. So her cellmate, in a friendly way, offered to be Anna's secretary.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.800
According to Anna, this cellmate agreed that she would read each letter very carefully and

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:22.240
then consult with Anna about how to respond. She became so good at the job that she even would

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:29.919
respond to letters by herself. While Anna's circumstances in prison were not ideal,

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:37.280
one day a prison guard conducted an inspection of the cell and asked Anna to give him her Bible.

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:42.400
She begged him not to take it away, but he did anyways.

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:48.080
Anna started to cry. Then something unexpected happened.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.400
Surprisingly, Anna's other cellmates started making a lot of noise and began beating on the

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.960
cell doors, demanding that the Bible be returned immediately to Anna. They told the guard,

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:07.840
to Anna, the Bible is more important than food because they had regularly seen her reading that

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:15.759
Bible. Eventually, the guard returned the Bible to our sister. Later, Anna confronted another test in

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:23.519
jail. Two of the prisoners in her cell were in jail for criminal activity, and they were singing

00:04:23.519 --> 00:04:30.480
gypsy songs one day about their criminal life. Even though our sister did not completely understand

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:37.199
the language they were using, she suspected that their singing included some vulgar speech.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.120
Immediately, Anna prayed to Jehovah and asked that he correct the situation.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.439
And again, something unexpected happened. Suddenly, one of the gypsy women began singing one of

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:55.839
our kingdom songs. Anna was shocked. She asked, how do you know this song? And then Anna joined

00:04:56.079 --> 00:05:02.720
her in finishing the song. As it turned out, this gypsy woman's mother had studied the Bible with

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:09.120
Jehovah's Witnesses, and during that time, her daughter, who's now in prison, had memorized the

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:16.959
kingdom song. Anna said that this experience was proof that Jehovah responds very quickly to prayers

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:21.279
and that he can even use non-witnesses to encourage his servants.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:28.879
Well, brothers and sisters, in thinking about the promise in Isaiah 41, verse 10, can there be any

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:36.639
doubt that Jehovah is with Anna and with all of our imprisoned brothers and sisters at this time?

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:45.439
Even when cut off from family and friends, Jehovah gives his servants his full affection and attention.

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:53.439
A second experience received last July highlights that the fact that Jehovah is our God,

00:05:53.439 --> 00:06:00.639
the second assurance in Isaiah 41, 10. A brother we will call Peter, reported this, and I quote,

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:07.279
During the first few months of imprisonment, I was placed in solitary confinement. I felt

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:13.600
downhearted and began to dream of a shepherding visit. I thought about how good it would be to talk

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:19.600
with two brothers in ties. I had heard that in some congregations, when someone received a

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:28.160
shepherding visit, they would say after the fact, the ties came to visit me. I too wanted such a visit,

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:35.759
so I prayed, Jehovah, I understand that this is practically impossible now, but I want the ties

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:39.600
to come visit me. Peter goes on to state,

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:49.120
After a short time, I received a letter with a card. The card was made in the form of a pink shirt

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.959
with a yellow tie. You'll see it on the monitors. In the cards, Peter said,

00:06:54.959 --> 00:07:01.759
were the words from the song Shepherds Gifts in Men, our song 103.

00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:08.319
Brothers and sisters, can you imagine how Peter felt at that moment? How did he

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:15.199
view Jehovah? He continues, this was the answer to my prayer, a real shepherding visit.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.519
This encouraged me more than I could have imagined. It was one of the best days during that difficult

00:07:21.519 --> 00:07:27.360
time. With tears, I thanked Jehovah for his support. I saw tangible evidence of Jehovah's

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.720
care for my emotional needs. I will keep this card as a treasured memento.

00:07:33.439 --> 00:07:39.920
Well, do we see how Jehovah proved true to that second assurance? I am your God.

00:07:40.959 --> 00:07:45.759
Jehovah answered Peter's need in an unexpected but very tender way.

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:52.160
In discussing this part of Isaiah 41 verse 10, the watchtower acknowledged that now more than ever,

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:58.240
we need to remember who is in control. People around us are in fear because so many things seem

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:04.160
out of control. And while we're affected by the same problems that affect other people,

00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:10.160
we know based on Jehovah's assurances that there's no need for us to be afraid.

00:08:11.279 --> 00:08:16.720
The problems people face today are like the strong winds that might rock an airplane during flight,

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:25.120
some passengers naturally panic. But why do we remain calm? Because we know who our pilot is.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:34.440
It is Jehovah our God. Let's consider one more experience that connects well with Isaiah 4110,

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:40.840
where Jehovah says, I will help you. In Illinois, we have a dear, anointed sister by the name of

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:46.200
Antonia, who is 90 years old. She's homebound and does not have a mobile device,

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:52.919
nor access to the internet. Due to the pandemic, she was very nervous about being home alone

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.559
last week for the memorial. So how did Jehovah help Antonia? The congregation worked out a plan

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:05.159
so that she could observe the memorial with another sister present without risking their health.

00:09:06.039 --> 00:09:12.759
Patty, a close friend, offered to assist Antonia if it would be safe to do so. So a doctor was

00:09:12.759 --> 00:09:18.039
consulted and he provided detailed instructions that would keep both sisters safe,

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:23.639
which included the use of gloves, masks, and sanitizing the plate in the cup that would be used

00:09:23.639 --> 00:09:30.360
for the emblems. When the plan was presented to our sister Antonia, she was asked if she would

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:39.399
like Patty to assist. She replied with all my heart. So our two sisters listened together to the

00:09:39.399 --> 00:09:46.759
memorial talk last week. Antonia partook of the emblems with tears in her eyes. With heartfelt

00:09:46.759 --> 00:09:55.799
emotion, she said, I pray to Jehovah to help me stay worthy and faithful. Brothers and sisters,

00:09:55.799 --> 00:10:03.480
these true-to-life experiences are heartwarming, aren't they? And what Jehovah has done for Anna,

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:10.840
Peter, and Antonia proves what the watchtower said. And I quote, no force in the universe can make

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:17.639
Jehovah abandon his love for those who serve him. His loyalty to us is unshakable.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:23.799
What would you like to strengthen your confidence in Jehovah our God and our Father?

00:10:24.679 --> 00:10:31.879
Today, why not meditate deeply on Isaiah 4110? If possible, commit those verses to memory.

00:10:32.679 --> 00:10:39.559
And let's keep working to get to know Jehovah better, by regularly reading the Bible carefully

00:10:39.559 --> 00:10:45.639
and meditating on what we read. Then, as we face trials together, we'll move ahead with full

00:10:45.639 --> 00:10:57.960
confidence that Jehovah is with us. We'll do so with faith, not fear.
