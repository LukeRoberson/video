00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:10.990
16 peaceful residents of Taginrog are accused of organizing the activities of an extremist

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.589
organization.

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:16.750
If you examine the law, it's hard to find something in the law that would allow it to

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.390
be applied to Jehovah's Witnesses at all, since even as the European court notes, Jehovah's

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.989
Witnesses are peaceable people.

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:30.670
The basis for initiating the criminal case was video material that was secretly recorded

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.789
by operational or special services.

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:40.469
They are recordings of the religious services of Jehovah's Witnesses, and in the court session,

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.469
we watched those recordings.

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.469
There is nothing criminal in them.

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:53.310
People are reading the Bible, people are singing songs, people are praying to God.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.549
That's all the evidence in essence that there is.

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:59.509
There are video recordings of religious services in which it is plainly evident that these

00:00:59.509 --> 00:01:03.270
are typical religious services which are held in various cities.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.390
New York, London, and also in Rostov on Don.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.269
These are all the same religious services.

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:13.950
You take a normal citizen of the Russian Federation, living under normal circumstances with

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.909
a normal family, and suddenly there's a search, and they charge me with being a criminal.

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:20.790
What violation did I commit?

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.709
Even now I still don't understand.

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:28.590
I was given a paper that had a phrase on it, that if a person stops doing what he had

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.750
been doing, and promises to not do it again, then they would stop the criminal prosecution.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.390
The investigator plainly stated in his office, sign a paper that you renounce being one

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.750
of Jehovah's Witnesses, and we will close the whole case against you and release you.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.349
Go where you want.

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:48.590
They asked me to sign that document.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.150
In essence, they asked me to renounce my faith, which of course I refused to do, but that

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.469
fact is clear.

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:55.469
That's what they want.

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:58.269
They want me to renounce my faith.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.790
How can you judge a person for what he believes?

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.989
You can judge a person for theft, and imprison him for, let's say, five years.

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:13.590
But if a person has faith in his imprisoned, will he renounce his faith in prison?

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.270
Every religious person has the right to profess his religious views.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.030
If the verdict is guilty, of course this will affect me, as well as all of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.750
because this will be a precedent.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.629
It is the only judicial case in Russia where believers are, essentially, being compelled

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:36.430
to renounce their faith under threat of criminal prosecution.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.550
In the very center of the city of Tagan Rock is a building with a commemorative plaque

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.949
inscribed with the following.

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:53.830
The People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs was located in this building from 1928 to

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:01.189
1941, where repressed people were groundlessly tortured.

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:07.229
I really hope that in a few decades from now, there won't be a commemorative plaque on

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:11.870
the building of the Tagan Rock City Court with the inscription.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:18.270
In 2014, peaceful residents of the city of Tagan Rock were groundlessly repressed in this

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.389
building, only because they were believers.
