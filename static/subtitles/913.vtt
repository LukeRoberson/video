00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.919
Greenwood was a thriving black community in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with many

00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:11.119
professionals, including attorney and newspaper columnist Richie J. Hill, a

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:18.199
zealous servant of Jehovah. In May of 1921, Tulsa, Oklahoma became the site of

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:22.800
one of the worst race massacres in the United States history. Hundreds of

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.679
armed men invaded Greenwood. They beaten kill many black citizens. It was a

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:35.640
massacre. Arthur Klaus was another faithful brother there in Tulsa. When he

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.119
heard about the violence, he became very concerned about his good friend, Richard

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:45.359
Hill, who was living in Greenwood. So brother Klaus went to brother Hill's home

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:51.200
to check on but brother Klaus found an armed neighbor protecting his home. He

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.899
thought that brother Klaus was another stranger coming there. Brother Klaus

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.700
immediately identified himself. He explained that he was a friend of Richard

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:06.180
Hill's and he was looking for him to try to help him and that's when he was told

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.980
that many of the black people in that area had been taken to the convention

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:17.810
home. So brother Klaus headed back into downtown Tulsa. The National Guard had

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.370
been called in and had placed General Barrett in charge and he decided that no

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.650
black person could leave the convention hall without a signed order. So brother

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.409
Klaus patiently waited to see the general and explained that he just wanted to

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.489
help his friend. After brother Klaus agreed to be responsible for the family

00:01:38.489 --> 00:01:43.409
the general signed the order. But then brother Klaus had to walk through a

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.090
mob of armed white men to getting to the convention hall. It happened to be

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.930
the same location that just two nights before Judge Rutherford had

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.930
delivered the talk. Millions now living will never die. But brother Klaus

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:05.650
courageously walked up to the guard, handed him to sign order and was let in.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.810
Now the auditorium was filled with black people who must have been very positive

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.050
to see a white man. But brother Klaus calmly walked through the crowd, met brother

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:24.090
Hill and his family and took them back to their home. In the auditorium brother

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.409
Klaus overheard people say, now look at that. They're the only religious group to

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:35.889
go to the general and get a release for their people. You know we're in the

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:42.409
wrong religion I'm thinking. Brother Klaus showed patience and discernment and he

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:49.689
was able to help a brother in danger. And in his weekly newspaper column brother

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:54.530
Hill continued to echo the message of brother Rutherford's talk that God's

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.169
kingdom is the solution to all of the world's problems including mob balance.
