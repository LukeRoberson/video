00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:10.359
I'm building a new step that I take.

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:13.160
So, you're going to talk to any group of people?

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.160
I don't think so.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.960
Look, I know you got a part-time job lined up and you're going to find your...

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.559
Yeah, so...

00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:24.559
So, the video production people are here.

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:26.559
I'm sure they have part-time.

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:28.760
Yeah, I still don't know.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.159
Look, Dennis, you're good at it.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.759
Besides, they do corporate videos.

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:37.789
Nothing bad.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.990
Come on.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.390
Just talk to them.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:49.840
All right, I'll check it out.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.439
I hear you.

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:54.640
Eventually, you want to work part-time to pursue other passions.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.439
Oh, well, I'd like to start part-time.

00:00:58.439 --> 00:01:00.439
It's doable.

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:02.640
But after you're established,

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.640
after a few years of hard work and dedication,

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.239
you'll be able to pick your own jobs.

00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:11.040
And you'll even get to set your own schedule.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.840
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.239
Hey, thanks so much for your time.

00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:18.439
One second, before you leave.

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.280
Just so you know,

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.989
here's what you can make in your first year.

00:01:25.989 --> 00:01:27.390
My advice?

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.189
Try not to get too caught up in the sacrifice.

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.859
Think about the payback.

00:01:33.859 --> 00:02:12.740
Thanks.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.659
Money.

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.460
No.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.340
Wealth.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.930
Proverbs 23, 4 and 5.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.530
Do not wear yourself out to gain wealth.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.270
Stop and show understanding.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.270
When you cast your eyes on it,

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.080
it is not there.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.879
For it will surely sprout wings that can eagle

00:02:42.879 --> 00:03:00.139
and fly off into the sky.

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:02.340
Hey, you ready to go?

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.060
Yeah, ready.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.860
So, you talk to anybody?

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.060
Yeah.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.060
Learned anything good?

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.259
I did.

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:14.259
We'll tell you.
