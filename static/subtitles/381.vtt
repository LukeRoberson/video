00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:14.490
The text today is taken from the Watchtower 2016 January and the theme be compel by God's indescribable free gift.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:25.489
Well, this memorial season really does move us to contemplate what Jehovah has done for us and we should be compel.

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:31.489
The insight volume has a very interesting article on this matter of forgiveness.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:44.490
And one of the statements it mentions that the Hebrew verb Salah for forgive is used only with regard to Jehovah's pardoning a sinner.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.490
It's never used in connection with a human for giving a human.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:57.490
So the extent of and reasons for Jehovah's forgiveness really are unmatchable.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.490
So what should we be compel to do?

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.489
Well, let's reflect on the illustration that Jesus gave in Matthew chapter 18.

00:01:07.489 --> 00:01:16.489
And if you turn there, you'll recall that in verse 21, Peter had asked Lord,

00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:24.489
how many times am I to forgive my brother if he sins against me up to seven times?

00:01:25.489 --> 00:01:27.489
Now, what was wrong with that question?

00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:37.489
Well, Peter had been influenced by a hard, hearted spirit that was prevalent in those days and in some instances even today.

00:01:38.489 --> 00:01:40.489
But what do we mean?

00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:44.489
Well, Peter measured forgiveness.

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:48.489
And that was common among the Pharisees.

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:52.489
Jesus went on to say what in verse 22.

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:57.489
We know it very well. I say to you, not up to seven times, but up to 77 times.

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:10.490
And then in connection with divine forgiveness, Jesus responds in a way that helps us to see the contrast in the human understanding of forgiveness and God.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.490
Notice what he says in verse 23.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:23.490
That is why the kingdom of the heavens may be likened to a king who wanted to settle accounts with his slaves.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.490
Now notice the king wanted to settle accounts.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:29.490
It wasn't the slaves.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:40.490
The slaves had built up a debt with the king and just as called for the king to handle matters, balance the books as it were.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:48.490
But then he found one slave who owed him 10,000 talents, $40 million.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:50.490
That's a lot of money.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.490
Jehovah, if we think about that illustration, is telling us something.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:07.490
He has given those that is his slaves, us a lot of leeway.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.490
He has forgiven us thousands of times.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.490
So often that we are not aware really of the many sins we commit against Jehovah.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:28.490
Now going back to the illustration of verse 26, this slave begs because he can't afford to pay off.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:36.490
And he says to the master, be patient with me and I'll pay everything I owe you. Well, how in the world could he do that?

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:44.490
It was a slave. How could he pay back for me? And the master knew there's no way he could pay this back.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:53.490
When I'm putting the illustration in today's terms, the average yearly wage for the United States, I Googleize this.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:02.490
In 2014 was almost $52,000. That's everybody just averaging out.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:08.490
There are a lot of people who don't make that much and many who make more than that. But the average was $52,000.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:23.490
Now if the 10,000 talents equal $40 million, it would take a man 770 years to pay off that debt if he gave everything that he made to pay off the debt.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.490
So the master knew this slave, he can't pay me.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:36.490
So verse 27 says, move with pity at this. The master of the slave let him off and canceled his debt.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:48.490
What a relief that would be. But the slave should have recognized something. He could never be in the same position as the master.

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.490
He didn't have the resources.

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:59.490
Nor could anyone possibly owe him what he owed the master.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:11.490
Now if he had captured the spirit of forgiveness shown to him, there would hardly be any debt owed to him that he couldn't tolerate or even forget it.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:20.490
But in verse 28, look at his attitude. That slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves, same plain as him,

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:30.019
who owed him $100 in the area, $70. Now notice he went out and found that slave.

00:05:31.019 --> 00:05:44.019
So he was rather than looking to overlook the debts of those who were indebted to him, he was looking for those who owed him.

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:54.019
Now we're going to read verses 29, 30, 32, 33, 35 notice.

00:05:55.019 --> 00:06:03.019
So his fellow slave fell down and began to beg him saying, be patient with me and I'll pay you back.

00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:09.019
However, he was not willing. Now let's stop there.

00:06:10.019 --> 00:06:18.019
Is it possible that this slave that owed him could pay him back? Yes, it possible he could work it out within his resources, $70.

00:06:19.019 --> 00:06:28.019
But then how was the reaction? The account says he went and had him thrown into prison until he could pay back what he owed.

00:06:29.019 --> 00:06:32.019
Boy, how petty.

00:06:33.019 --> 00:06:41.019
Verse 32, then the master summoned him and said to him, wicked slave, I cancel all that debt for you.

00:06:42.019 --> 00:06:50.019
When you pleaded with me, that debt that you could never have paid off, should you not also have shown mercy to your fellow slave?

00:06:51.019 --> 00:06:57.019
That slave who possibly could have paid it off, the same as I showed you mercy.

00:06:58.019 --> 00:07:06.019
And then the clincher, verse 35, Jesus' point, my heavenly father will also deal with you.

00:07:06.019 --> 00:07:20.019
That's me and that's you. In the same way, if each of you does not forgive your brother, not by root, not by formula, but from our heart.

00:07:20.019 --> 00:07:32.529
Now the king, as we said, forgave the debt of $40 million. That slave was unwilling to forgive his fellow slave for amount of $70.

00:07:32.529 --> 00:07:41.529
Jehovah is a big forgiver. And we thank him for that. Last evening, he helped us to see how big.

00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:57.839
Really grasping the death of our indebtedness to Jehovah and the death of his forgiveness should compel us to constantly work at having a forgiving spirit.

00:07:57.839 --> 00:08:08.839
And inside volume says that in the Bible, the Hebrew word nasa, made to note pardon or forgiveness extended by God or by humans.

00:08:08.839 --> 00:08:19.839
But as we stated originally, salah is used extensively for God's forgiveness, the act by which a sinner is restored to divine favor.

00:08:19.839 --> 00:08:26.839
Now remember, our forgiveness can't begin to match Jehovah's.

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:40.840
So there's nothing that any human can do to us that matches what we, born in sin, alienated from God and climbed to do wrong, have done to offend Jehovah.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:55.840
And yet, as we discussed yesterday last evening and were reminded of, God recommends his own love to us. And that while we were yet sinners, he had his son die for us.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:07.840
I'd like to quote to you a watchtower of October 15, 1999, page 13, October 15, 1999. The article is forgive from your heart. It says this.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:23.840
You should see in God's willingness to forgive a pattern as to how you ought to treat other humans. Paul focused on this writing, become kind to one another, tenderly compassionate, freely forgiving.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:32.840
Not like an accountant, keeping track, but freely forgiving one another, just as God also by Christ freely forgave you.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:41.840
Then the watchtower says this. Do you see the link? Jehovah God forgave you. It's me.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:51.840
So Paul forcefully reasons you need to imitate God and be tenderly compassionate, freely forgiving of others.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:58.840
And then the watchtower asks some penetrating questions. Is it ask yourself, am I really doing that?

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:06.840
If it is not in my nature, am I working in that direction, really striving to imitate God and being forgiving.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:15.309
Now we might say, well, I'm forgiving. I forgive a lot of people. Proof, proverb 179.

00:10:15.309 --> 00:10:23.309
Whoever forgives a transgression seeks love, but the one who keeps harping on a matter separates close friends.

00:10:23.309 --> 00:10:31.309
If we keep talking about what somebody's done to us, we haven't forgiven in the heart. Jehovah doesn't do that.

00:10:31.309 --> 00:10:38.309
So forgiving others for personal offenses, regardless of the number of times involved, is a Christian requirement.

00:10:38.309 --> 00:10:50.309
God's forgiveness is not extended toward those who refuse to forgive. Remember what Jesus said. Forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors.

00:10:50.309 --> 00:10:57.309
And what a beautiful God we have. His action and that of his son compels us to be freely forgiving.
