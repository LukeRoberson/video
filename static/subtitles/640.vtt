00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:06.400
If you're an elder or you're reaching out to be one, then Peter's words have special meaning

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:14.640
for you. First Peter chapter five, he says, I make this appeal to the elders among you,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:21.920
shepherd the flock of God. As elders, we may have many different assignments, but this is one

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:30.960
key responsibility. We are shepherds. Shepherds, doesn't that evoke a heartwarming picture?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:41.359
You see a loyal man leading and feeding and protecting the sheep. So let's look at Peter's

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:47.520
instructions to shepherds and we're going to answer three important questions. Who owns the sheep?

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:54.240
What is the job of a spiritual shepherd? How does he keep the sheep safe?

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.359
Peter's instructions. I've turned to first Peter chapter five and we're going to start

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:05.840
at verse two. You may want to put a bookmark there. We're going to come back to this a lot.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:13.280
First Peter five, two, shepherd the flock of God under your care, serving as overseers,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.799
not under compulsion, but willingly before God, not for love of dishonest gain, but eagerly,

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.519
not lauding it over those who are God's inheritance, but becoming examples to the flock.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:38.459
Who owns the sheep? They are the flock of God. And Peter goes further, he calls them in verse three,

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:48.939
God's inheritance. What does that mean to you? Well, the Apostle Paul used a similar point

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.340
and he helps us to understand it. In Acts chapter 20, he was talking to the elders in Ephesus.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:03.579
Acts 20 verse 28, he tells them to shepherd the congregation of God which he purchased with the blood

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:12.860
of his own son. Jehovah paid the most precious price because he views the sheep as that precious.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.300
And because we really love and want to please Jehovah, we take the same view. So coming back to

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:29.020
first Peter five and verse two, because of this, we serve not under compulsion, but willingly

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:38.939
before God. We want to please Jehovah, not for love of dishonest gain, but eagerly, because we love

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:47.500
the sheep as their owner, Jehovah does. Second question, what is the job of the shepherd? We're in

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:56.300
first Peter chapter five of us two. And he says, shepherd the flock, serving as overseers.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:05.979
What does that mean to you? What is an overseer? Perhaps we think of him as the one who's in charge,

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:13.500
the one who makes the decisions. But is that what is meant here? Let's go back to Paul's words in

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.580
Acts chapter 20. If you'd like to turn there, Acts 20 and verse 28, remember Paul's talking to

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:27.659
elders. And he says, pay attention to yourselves into all the flock among which the Holy Spirit has

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:35.500
appointed you overseers to shepherd the congregation of God. You notice Paul does some of the

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.659
thing to what Peter does. He says that shepherds are overseers. Now in this verse, we have the benefit

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:50.930
of a study note. So if you can find the study note for overseers, the basic meaning to watch carefully

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:58.289
or to inspect. Now go about a quarter way down and you see a sentence that begins protective

00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:06.849
supervision. Protective supervision is a basic idea inherent in the Greek term. Overseers in the

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:12.610
Christian congregation have the responsibility to care for spiritual concerns of their fellow

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:21.970
believers. So the key phrase, protective supervision. It's not about authority. Rather, it's about

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:32.019
care. It's about keeping the sheep well-fed, healthy, safe. How does an overseer care for spiritual

00:04:32.019 --> 00:04:40.339
concerns of the sheep? We imagine someone approaches you as the elder. He's got a big decision

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:46.500
that he has to make. And so he asks, what should I do? For example, should I sign up for that

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:54.290
college course? Should I go into debt to buy that new car? Should I marry that sister? What are you

00:04:54.290 --> 00:05:01.649
going to tell him? He comes to you as the shepherd because you perhaps have greater experience,

00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:08.850
spiritual experience. It's easy to think, well, yes, I know exactly what's going to keep him safe.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:16.769
So let me tell him what decision he should make. Would we do that? No, not really. Because if we

00:05:16.769 --> 00:05:26.129
go back to 1 Peter 5, yes, it's true in verse 2, we serve as overseers. But then in verse 3,

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:33.089
Peter balances that he says, not lauding it over those who are God's inheritance. Right there,

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:40.610
notice we have a marginal reference. So tap on that little E and you'll see in the study

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:49.490
pain, 2 Corinthians 1 and verse 24. Paul made a similar point. He says, not that we are the

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:58.209
masters over your faith or literally the lords of your faith, but we are fellow workers for your joy,

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:05.250
for it is by your faith that you are standing. So the overseer doesn't make decisions for others.

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:11.649
Rather, he works closely with them to help them to understand and have faith in Jehovah's

00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:17.569
Principles so that their decisions made in faith will give them an approved standing before Jehovah.

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:25.009
Then our dear carries through to the other role of a shepherd. So back to 1 Peter 5,

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:35.410
we were in verse 3 and not lauding it, Peter said, but becoming examples to the flock,

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:41.730
examples. Now again, this is not the kind of example where the shepherd says,

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:47.490
this is the way that I've done it, you should do it this way. Now his example is not a template

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:54.610
for others to follow that closely or exactly. Rather, it's more like what the apostle Paul described

00:06:54.610 --> 00:07:01.009
when he talked to the Hebrews. If you wouldn't mind turning to Hebrews chapter 13 and verse 7.

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:09.250
In this case, Paul is talking to the sheep about the shepherds and in verse 7 he says,

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:16.370
remember those who are taking the lead among you who have spoken the word of God to you, not their

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:24.370
own word, the word of God. And as you contemplate how their conduct turns out, imitate their

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:34.850
faith. So we teach the sheep Jehovah's words and then as shepherds, the way we make decisions should

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:44.129
show such a deep faith in Jehovah's ways in his principles that our faith and the way our decisions

00:07:44.129 --> 00:07:52.209
turn out should be a good example for the sheep. So what is the job of a shepherd carrying over

00:07:52.370 --> 00:08:00.930
here? An example of faith. And did you notice that we really have covered the third question too?

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:09.250
How does the shepherd keep the sheep safe? Well, by word and by example, he builds a strong faith

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:15.569
in Jehovah so that the sheep are able through their faith to stand approved before Jehovah.

00:08:18.459 --> 00:08:27.040
So shepherds, trainee shepherds, what have you learned from Peter's words? Who owns the sheep?

00:08:28.399 --> 00:08:35.360
Well, these are Jehovah's precious sheep and we learn to view them exactly the same way and so

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.279
we look after them willingly. We are eager to care for them on Jehovah's behalf.

00:08:42.639 --> 00:08:48.639
What is the job of the shepherd? He's the carrying overseer. He's an example of faith.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:54.639
He provides protective supervision. How does he keep the sheep safe?

00:08:55.759 --> 00:09:01.360
By his word and his example, he builds a strong faith in Jehovah.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:09.519
An elder's life contains many different assignments but whatever else we do as elders,

00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:16.320
we thank Jehovah that he has entrusted us with this one special privilege to shepherd his

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.320
precious sheep.
