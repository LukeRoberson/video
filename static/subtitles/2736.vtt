00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.219
All who truly followed Jesus reflected the light he radiated.

00:00:07.219 --> 00:00:13.080
But Jesus foretold that after the death of his apostles,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.160
there would be a falling away from pure worship.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.160
That apostasy would be so extensive that genuine disciples

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.160
would practically disappear until the conclusion of the system of things.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.159
At the same time, a counterfeit form of Christianity would flourish.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:49.329
And so it happened.

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.329
So-called Christian churches deviated from Christ's teachings.

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:01.380
The result was the abuse of power and untold suffering.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:09.340
This was a period of deep darkness.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:19.200
In the centuries after the establishment of the Christian congregation,

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.200
we see how many of those who were taking the lead in the Christian church

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.200
or the Christian congregation started to likewise love worldly wisdom.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.200
These ideas that came from Plato and other of the Greek philosophers

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.200
started to infiltrate the so-called Christian thinking.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.200
And so the apostates wished to blend a Christian teaching

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.200
and Christian tradition with pagan religious ideas.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.200
And the idea was to make these things more acceptable to other pagans

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.200
so that pagans could be drawn into the Christian religion.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.930
As the centuries passed,

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.930
apostate religious leaders obscured the light even further

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.930
by keeping the Bible in Latin,

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.930
a language no longer understood by most people.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.930
Yet, at certain points during this darkness,

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.930
there were still individuals who felt keenly the need to read

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.930
and understand God's word.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.930
For example, in the 1100s,

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.930
a French merchant known as Vodet commissioned a translation of Bible books

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.930
into the language of the common people.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.930
Two centuries later,

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.930
Catholic priest John Wickliffe wrote powerfully against unbiblical practices of the church.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:50.159
By 1382, Wickliffe's team released the first translation of the Bible into English.

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.159
His students, known as Lollards,

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:56.159
preached the Bible's message to anyone who would listen.

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:03.330
By 1495, the invention of movable type

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:10.250
made it possible to print all or part of the Bible in 12 languages.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.620
Soon, people were reading it for themselves.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:22.620
And some who did began to discern that the church had gone off course.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.620
In the 1500s, such men as Haldraik Swingley,

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.620
Martin Luther and John Calvin preached the need to return

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.669
to the original principles of Christianity.

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:41.669
These men and others tried to expose hypocritical practices

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:43.669
and uphold Bible teachings,

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:49.919
even though this put them at odds with powerful religious authorities.

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:53.919
You can see ones that were willing to stand out as being different,

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:59.939
even though they didn't have a full knowledge of the truth.

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:02.939
But standing out led to persecution

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:10.110
and persecution often led to compromise,

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.110
especially when it came to preacher.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:19.500
Nevertheless, in many lands,

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.500
the 16 and 1700s were marked by a strong upsurge in Bible study.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:34.250
In England, many learned men refuted the Trinity doctrine as unscriptural.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.250
Among them, scientists Sir Isaac Newton,

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.250
poet John Milton,

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.250
and chemist Joseph Priestley.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.250
Besides rejecting the Trinity doctrine,

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.250
Priestley declared that the teaching of the inherent immortality of the soul was false.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.250
He held that the first century Christians had the true faith,

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.250
and that any change to that pattern of belief was a corruption.
