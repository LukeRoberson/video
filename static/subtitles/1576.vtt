00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.219
Abner had been chief of Saul's army.

00:00:05.219 --> 00:00:07.219
He pursued David in the wilderness

00:00:07.219 --> 00:00:11.220
and supported David's rival after David became king.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.220
So why was Abner coming to see David?

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:22.420
My lord, the king, make a covenant with us.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.420
We now support you as king.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.420
Because Jehovah has promised a salvation by means of your hand.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:38.000
I will make a covenant with you.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.759
David trusted Abner and hoped that he would now remain loyal.

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:52.530
But Joab saw things differently.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.530
What have you done? You know Abner.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.530
He came here to fool you and to get to know your every move

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.530
and find out everything that you're doing.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.899
Careful. You know the law.

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.900
You must not hold a grudge and you must love your fellow men as yourself.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.900
Joab's distrust grew into vengeance.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.900
He later killed Abner.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.620
Those who hate expect the worst.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.620
But those who love never lose hope.
