00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:11.779
9 o'clock already?

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:17.300
Looks like it's going to be another late night.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.820
I just can't seem to catch up.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:35.939
I'm trying to keep up with everything, but there just never seems to be enough time

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:37.420
in the day.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.299
I'm not a Superman.

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:44.409
Nobody here.

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:48.000
Hmm.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.640
Could anyone have been busier than Jesus?

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.560
But you know what?

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.840
He wasn't alone.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.079
He had help.

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.759
He had his faithful disciples.

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:05.000
He took the time to patiently train them.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.159
He showed his trust in them by giving them assignments.

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.400
And he empowered them by giving them the tools that they needed.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.400
Hmm.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.769
How about that?

00:01:21.769 --> 00:01:35.489
I don't have to be a Superman.

00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:38.689
I just have to imitate the greatest man.

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:39.689
Hey Brandon.

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:40.689
It's John.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.250
Wonder if you can help me with something.
