00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:09.820
India, known as the world's largest democracy, is home to more than 1.2 billion humans,

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.820
speaking 1,652 languages.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:23.820
While the majority are Hindus by religion, Islam, Christendom, Sikhism, Buddhism,

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.820
Jainism all have their adherence.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:35.820
The climate culture, customs and living conditions vary greatly in the 29 states of India.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:43.820
Thus the India branch cares for a vast and diverse field full of challenges.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:53.820
Happily, Jehovah God has blessed the hard work of His people with a 7% increase in 2014.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.820
Spiritual food from the faithful steward is available in 23 major languages

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.819
and we have 11 remote translation offices.

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:12.290
Also, there's a great need for decent meeting places.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:20.290
And over the past 10 years, 168 kingdom halls have been constructed.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:29.290
But it will be many years before all congregation will have their own suitable meeting places.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.290
You see, we are restricted from receiving funds from other countries,

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.290
hence we have to rely on our local resources.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.290
I would like to share an experience with you.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:52.290
A temporary special pioneer couple was assigned to work in the distant northeastern state of Nagaland,

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.290
which was last worked by pioneers 35 years ago.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.290
Most people in Nagaland are nominal Christians.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.290
The pioneer couple met an elderly lady in her 70s.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.289
In the discussion that followed, the lady asked the pioneers who they were

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.289
and what denomination they belonged to.

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:16.289
On hearing that they were Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:22.289
she was overjoyed, so overjoyed that she got up and excitedly invited them inside.

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:29.289
She said that she is also a witness, although not baptized.

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:35.289
She mentioned that she had studied earlier and showed the pioneers her collection of our literature

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:43.289
from the 1970s, including yearbooks, the songbook and other publications.

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:47.289
She said that she used to attend meetings at the kingdom hall,

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:52.289
but her husband, a staunch Baptist, was very opposed.

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:56.289
After the pioneers who taught her the truth moved away.

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:59.289
She did not have any contact with witnesses.

00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:04.289
However, this lady was thoroughly convinced

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:10.289
that she had found the truth and had been talking and reasoning with her children

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:14.289
and relatives about the truth for more than 30 years.

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:19.289
She said that she had been praying to Jehovah God through Jesus Christ,

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:23.289
asking that she should show her the way to serve Him again.

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:30.289
Meanwhile, recently, her children began to put pressure on her to go to church

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:37.289
so that she would be recognized as a member and get a church burial.

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:44.289
Under pressure, she had gone just two days ago to meet the clergymen to renew her membership,

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:47.289
but she could not meet the clergymen.

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:54.289
Now she was so happy that the witnesses had found her in answer to her prayers.

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:59.289
She said that she wants to get baptized as a witness

00:03:59.289 --> 00:04:02.289
and now she's attending all meetings regularly

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:07.539
and a Bible study has again been started with her from the Bible Teachbook.

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:15.539
This shows that the seed of truth can sprout even years later in sincere hearts.

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:26.850
The 377 members of India Bethel family send you their warm Christian love and greetings.
