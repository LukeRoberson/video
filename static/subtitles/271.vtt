00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:09.570
When I was 17 years old, I was very shy and had low self-esteem.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.570
Almost all my classmates had girlfriends and looked like they were having fun.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.570
This made me feel really lonely.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.570
I had been baptized for four years.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.570
At school, my classmates respected me because of my conduct.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.570
But something was about to happen that could have changed my life forever.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.570
There were a lot of girls at my school.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.570
One girl in particular was really pretty.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.570
Although we were not in the same class, we would often see each other in the hall.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:47.570
In the school cafeteria or during gym class, I noticed that she would look at me.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.570
One day, two girls handed me a letter from her.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.570
The letter said, I think we would get along.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.570
I'm attracted to you.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.570
I like your personality, and that's not all.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.569
I hope you make the right decision.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:08.569
We could really have fun together, with love yours truly.

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:10.569
I felt dazed.

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:13.569
I honestly didn't know what to do.

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:17.569
My classmates urged me to accept her proposition immediately.

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:21.569
When I got home, I was really confused.

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:27.569
My parents asked me what was going on, but I couldn't talk to them about it.

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:33.569
I wondered whether I would ever meet another girl as beautiful as she was.

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:38.569
During those days, it was as if I had lost my Christian identity.

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:40.569
I prayed a lot.

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:44.569
I had dedicated my life to Jehovah, and I couldn't let him down.

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:48.569
So I opened up to my parents, and they were patient with me.

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:53.569
We did some intensive study together using the young people's last book.

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:56.569
Going through articles that applied to me,

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:59.569
helped me overcome the problem.

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:02.569
I also spoke to my true brother in the congregation,

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:07.569
and decided to spend more time with him as well as other brothers.

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:09.569
I mustered up courage.

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.569
I went to her and told her my decision.

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:20.569
I explained my Bible-based convictions, and said, no, it was a very wise decision.

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.569
I then had a clean conscience, and I hadn't brought reproach on Jehovah's name.

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.569
I had safeguarded my relationship with him.

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.569
I learned that if we are determined to be loyal to Jehovah,

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.569
and we have the courage to remain chased,

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.569
well, we won't have any regrets.

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.569
Until age 17, I had not understood this.

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.569
Jehovah has truly blessed me since then,

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.569
giving me the privilege of serving in the congregation in many ways,

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.569
and giving me a lovely wife to serve him with.

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.569
I thank Jehovah for having helped me to make the right decision.
