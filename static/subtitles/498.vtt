00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:08.009
This morning we're going to discuss the thought of keeping the belt of truth tight around our

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:10.009
wastes.

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:12.210
Now why is that so important?

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.530
Well we see in the world today there's just no end to the misinformation, the lies,

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.410
the falsehoods that are being spread.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:27.609
But in addition to that, as Jehovah's people, we face all sorts of verbal attacks, don't

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:32.130
worry, people accusing us of horrific things.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.530
And this can be very discouraging.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.770
So that's why we need to make sure that we've got the belt of truth firmly around our waste

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.289
tight.

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:43.929
But how can we tighten it?

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:50.369
Well of course there are many different ways that we can reassure ourselves of the truth.

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:55.170
But this morning I thought we might talk about just one thing that may help us.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.729
And that is to go back to the basics.

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:06.969
From time to time to think about this question, what was it that convinced me or my family

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:09.209
that this is the truth?

00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:15.930
And if we meditate on that, it can help to strengthen our resolve to continue in the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:16.930
truth.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.290
And in this way, figuratively speaking, it's as if we tighten the belt.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.209
We all know those of us that wear belts, you need a tight belt for it to be effective.

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:32.250
Now with that in mind, if ever you visit me in my office, you'll notice that I have two

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.329
things that from time to time I'll look at.

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.530
One is this publication.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.489
Now when you look at it, you might say the same as my wife did a few days ago, don't you

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:47.489
have a better copy of that addition?

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:49.730
It's not really looking so good.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.489
So why is this in my collection of books in the office?

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:59.730
Well because this is the book, let God be true, that my mother started studying in 1956

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.689
when she was contacted in the door to door work.

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.370
Now I have a connection to this because at that time I was 18 months old.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:15.569
And as you can see in the front, I had no potential whatsoever of being in the writing department

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.610
or the art department.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.930
But I guess it did prove that an early age I was interested in books.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:29.490
Anyway, this book is close to my heart because it helped my mother at a time when she faced

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.689
some opposition.

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:37.289
She just started using this book when a minister from the Methodist Church and a missionary

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:42.969
came along to her house to try to force her to stop studying with Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:45.689
Now what did they do?

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:52.289
Well they berated the witnesses, they said all sorts of falsehoods and they said everything

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:56.770
they could, there was negative about Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:02.610
Once they left, my mother said that she felt very discouraged and disheartened after being

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.129
the victim of this verbal abuse.

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:07.810
So what did she do?

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:14.889
She took her King James Bible and turned it to a scripture that she had just studied

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:19.250
in paragraph 5 of this book in the first chapter.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.610
Maybe you'd like to read it with me if you would.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.810
If you have a electronic device, you have an advantage this morning because I'd like

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.129
you to turn to the book of Isaiah chapter 8 and verse 20.

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:35.610
But I'd like you to read it from the King James version.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.610
So Isaiah chapter 8 verse 20.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:44.370
And if you tap on the verse 20, you'll see the King James version may come up.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.009
It says to the law and to the testimony.

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:55.569
If they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:02.210
Now that touched her heart and helped her to make the decision to continue on studying.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:07.490
Now if you're like me, you're probably trying to work out what is the testimony, what's

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.490
this all about.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.689
And if you look at the revised text of the New World Transition in verse 20, it helps

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:15.129
us, doesn't it?

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:22.730
There it says, instead, they should inquire of the law and of the written confirmation.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:28.529
When they do not speak according to this word, they have no light.

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:34.370
So she realized that these two who had come to visit her did not show her anything from

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.370
the scriptures.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.089
Rather, they just said what they felt about your harvest witnesses.

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:45.689
So that helped her because she realized, as the Let God be true, book says in chapter

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:54.689
1, that everything we will leave about God needs to be based on the Word of God, the Bible.

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:58.329
In other words, written confirmation.

00:04:58.329 --> 00:05:03.170
So that's the first lesson, the first point that is a good reminder to me personally.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:10.889
No matter what people say about us, no matter what negative comments are made, we can always

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:18.769
take comfort in the thought that our beliefs are solidly based on the Bible.

00:05:18.769 --> 00:05:25.410
Now the second thing that you may notice in my office is this watch out magazine.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.610
It's from February 15, 1955.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.810
If I'm not in my office and you see it, you may think, ah, he's got that there because

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.889
he was born just a couple of weeks after this.

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:41.930
No, that's not the reason it's there.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.769
The reason is that this was the second thing that helped my mother to take a stand for

00:05:46.769 --> 00:05:47.769
the truth.

00:05:47.769 --> 00:05:52.250
There were two beautiful articles in this watch out.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:06:00.250
The first one was entitled Only One Right Religion and notice how it starts off.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.689
If you pay for wheat, will you settle for straw?

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:08.250
If you buy wine, will you accept water?

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:13.009
Or if you thirst for water, will you be satisfied with mud?

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:18.089
What if someone came to prove that you were being defrauded in these ways?

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:22.610
Would you be angry with him or with the one who was cheating you?

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.370
What a great start to the article.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:30.569
And then it went on to show how the truth of God's word is being taught by Jehovah's

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:32.329
people today.

00:06:32.329 --> 00:06:37.050
But there's a second scripture that was in this magazine that really helped my mother.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:44.930
So if you'd like to turn with me to the book of Jeremiah, Jeremiah chapter 23.

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:51.250
Now in the context of this, we're going to read verses 28 and 29.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:55.449
But in the previous verses, it mentions false prophets.

00:06:55.449 --> 00:07:02.370
Those who tell lies, who are dreaming and they try to explain their dreams.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:09.170
And verse 27 says, these are the same ones who teach people or intend to make them forget

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:11.209
my name.

00:07:11.209 --> 00:07:15.209
So what does verse 28 and 29 say?

00:07:15.209 --> 00:07:19.129
Let the prophet, who has a dream, relate his dream.

00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:25.410
But the one who has my word should speak my word truthfully.

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:30.329
What does the straw have in common with the grain, the class Jehovah?

00:07:30.329 --> 00:07:35.129
You see how the watched our article was tied in there about grain and straw?

00:07:35.129 --> 00:07:40.810
But the point being that we need to speak God's word truthfully.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:47.129
Now the second article in this magazine, which is equally good, helps persons to see the

00:07:47.129 --> 00:07:49.529
need to select the true religion.

00:07:49.529 --> 00:07:55.009
It says choosing the one right religion.

00:07:55.009 --> 00:08:01.129
In this article, it raises the point that sometimes people say, well, I just don't have time

00:08:01.129 --> 00:08:03.769
to investigate all the religions in the world.

00:08:03.769 --> 00:08:06.970
How can I find the truth?

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:11.129
It's just like trying to find a needle in a haystack.

00:08:11.129 --> 00:08:17.730
Well this magazine, building on what was said in Jeremiah, said, well, if you go to a haystack

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:22.129
looking for a needle, you don't have to look at every straw in a haystack.

00:08:22.129 --> 00:08:27.129
Actually, they recommend quite a radical move, burn the haystack and then with a magnet

00:08:27.129 --> 00:08:29.370
you can find the needle.

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:30.889
Now what's the point?

00:08:30.889 --> 00:08:36.730
Well as it goes on to say, you see as Jeremiah said, God's word is like a fire.

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:41.210
You see in verse 29, it says, a fire that consumes a rubbish.

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:46.889
So we don't have to go around investigating all the various teachings of different religions

00:08:46.889 --> 00:08:49.529
that would be like a huge haystack.

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:55.450
But rather, when we study the Bible and we see the pure truth in the Scriptures, then

00:08:55.450 --> 00:09:03.009
we can identify anything that's virtually rubbish or straw and we have the real thing.

00:09:03.009 --> 00:09:09.649
Yes, that helps to really convince us that we have the truth because if people don't

00:09:09.649 --> 00:09:13.730
even know Jehovah's name, why would we believe them?

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:18.970
And if they believe that people are going to hellfire, why would we believe everything

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:24.610
that they say, particularly if they're criticizing Jehovah's people?

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:26.850
So what about you?

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:31.850
What was it that convinced you that you found the truth?

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:36.009
Well, it's good from time to time to think about that question.

00:09:36.009 --> 00:09:40.409
In my case, I think of those things that my mother taught me.

00:09:40.409 --> 00:09:47.009
The first one from the book of Isaiah, to make sure that what we believe is based on the

00:09:47.009 --> 00:09:48.009
Bible.

00:09:48.009 --> 00:09:53.690
And then the second thing, we don't have to investigate every story that's told to us.

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:59.169
Once we have the truth from the Bible, we can recognize what's right and what's wrong.

00:09:59.169 --> 00:10:05.529
Yes, we don't need to listen to the father of the lie, but we certainly believe in the

00:10:05.529 --> 00:10:06.529
God of Truth.
