00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:08.820
When you hear the word realistic, what comes to your mind?

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:16.620
Realistic conveys the idea of something that is practical, rational, reasonable, and sensible.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:22.460
Having expectations that are realistic is essential to joy and success in Jehovah's

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.660
service.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:34.259
In contrast, unrealistic expectations cause discouragement, as Proverbs 13-12 says.

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:42.899
Expectation postponed makes the heart sick, but a desire realized is a tree of life.

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.179
Appropriately, we often use this verse when referring to expectations that are not achieved

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:51.740
as quickly as we would like.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:01:00.179
However, expectations that are too high can also make our hearts sick.

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:06.219
Notice this quote from the August 8, 1983 issue of awake.

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:13.739
Disappointment is often not so much a matter of expectation postponed, as expectations

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:15.219
too high.

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:21.620
Now at times it is good to have high goals, to aim for the stars, but always expecting

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:28.299
to come out on top is a surefire way to beckon disappointment.

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:36.219
To avoid disappointment, our expectation should be reasonable and sensible.

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:43.819
In our discussion, we're going to answer the following three questions about our expectations.

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:51.540
Number one, why must we be realistic about what we expect from ourselves?

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.859
Number two, why must we be realistic and what we expect from our brothers and sisters?

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:06.379
And number three, why is it realistic to expect that Jehovah will reward us for our faithful

00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:09.810
sacred service?

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:17.650
Our first question is, why must we be realistic about what we expect from ourselves?

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:24.090
Of course, we love Jehovah with our whole heart, mind, and soul, and we want to do everything

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.969
for His glory.

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:33.610
However, the reality is that no matter how much we love Jehovah and want to obey Him,

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.930
we are sinful descendants of Adam.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:43.969
As a result, we occasionally transgress and thought, word, and deed.

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:51.409
Ecclesiastes 7.20 states, for there is no righteous man on earth who always does good and

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.849
never sins.

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:59.490
And James 3.2 reads, for we all stumble many times.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.810
If anyone does not stumble in word, he is a perfect man.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.610
Perhaps you can relate to the feelings of the Apostle Paul at Romans chapter 7, verses

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.210
18-20.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:20.569
For I know that in me, that is in my flesh, there dwells nothing good.

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:27.129
For I have the desire to do what is fine, but not the ability to carry it out.

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:35.370
For I do not do the good that I wish, but the bad that I do not wish is what I practice.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.930
Not then, I do what I do not wish, I am no longer the one carrying it out.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.610
But it is the sin dwelling in me.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.889
Paul struggled with his sinful flesh, made him feel miserable.

00:03:50.889 --> 00:04:00.689
At times, we too might feel dejected, disappointed, and frustrated over our shortcomings.

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:04.930
We may begin to feel like a failure.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.569
Not enable Paul to continue serving Jehovah with joy and zeal.

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:16.370
He honestly acknowledged his sinful condition and had complete confidence in the ransom sacrifice

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.449
of Jesus Christ.

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:28.529
Paul went on to say at Romans 7, 24 and 25, miserable man that I am, who will rescue me from

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:31.850
the body undergoing this death?

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.689
Thanks to God through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:42.569
Yes, through Jehovah's undeserved kindness and his loving provision of the ransom, we

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:48.610
can confidently remain in Jehovah's love and render worship that is acceptable to him,

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.449
even in our imperfect state.

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:58.529
How powerful is the ransom in allowing us to have a clean conscience and retain Jehovah's

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:00.529
approval?

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:05.449
Next, chapter 3, verse 19, answers this question.

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:12.730
Repet therefore and turn around so as to get your sins blotted out so that seasons of

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.290
refreshing may come from Jehovah himself.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:23.810
The original language word translated blotted out means to cause to disappear by wiping,

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.250
to remove so as to leave no trace.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.850
You know, it completely wipes out our sin.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.730
Illustrate.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.889
Imagine a white riding surface representing our clean standing before Jehovah.

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:45.970
Now, imagine that red dots are drawn on it representing our sins.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:53.050
We should not view the ransom as if Jehovah draws an X over each dot to cross them out.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.730
Those red dots would still be visible.

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:03.170
Rather, we should imagine Jehovah based on the ransom completely erasing the red dots

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:07.610
so that a clean white riding surface is restored.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:13.930
Jehovah further reassures us of the completeness of his forgiveness with the words recorded

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:18.769
at Psalm 103 verses 12 to 14.

00:06:18.769 --> 00:06:28.089
Jehovah remembers that we are dust and does not expect perfection from us.

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:37.089
As a merciful Father, He puts our sins as far off as the sunrise is from the sunset.

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:40.850
Even if a servant of Jehovah commits a serious sin.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:53.009
If he is truly repentant with godly sadness, his sin can be blotted out completely forgiven.

00:06:53.009 --> 00:07:00.569
Therefore, it is essential for us to maintain a reasonable, sensible, realistic view of

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:03.529
our imperfect state.

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:10.209
We're going to make mistakes, but we must have full trust in the reality of Jehovah's

00:07:10.209 --> 00:07:13.329
forgiveness based on the ransom.

00:07:13.329 --> 00:07:19.610
Also, we can learn valuable lessons from our errors so that we'll be less likely to

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.579
repeat them.

00:07:22.579 --> 00:07:31.139
We need patience, though, because some personality flaws and bad habits may not go away overnight.

00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:37.220
Some of them may even be a life-long battle.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:42.620
At times, we may need counsel and discipline.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:47.300
What should we realistically expect when receiving discipline?

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:55.620
Hebrews 12, 11 through 13, makes it clear that initially it will not be joyous.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.379
It is painful.

00:07:57.379 --> 00:08:05.100
However, when we humbly accept discipline and apply the counsel, we can be sure that

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:10.259
we will gain inner peace and be a better servant of Jehovah.

00:08:10.259 --> 00:08:18.060
Therefore, do not give up, but keep making progress.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:23.379
Never allow the devil to convince you that you are a failure.

00:08:23.379 --> 00:08:31.860
As stated in the September 1, 2001 issue of the Watchtower on page 18, Satan would like

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:35.379
nothing better than to rob you of your peace.

00:08:35.379 --> 00:08:40.460
He would surely like you to feel that your imperfection makes your service unacceptable

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.500
to God.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:47.379
Never allow the devil to demoralize you.

00:08:47.379 --> 00:08:53.860
Our second question for consideration is, why must we be realistic and what we expect

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:57.740
from our brothers and sisters?

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:04.379
Just as it's essential to avoid having expectations that are too high for ourselves, we must

00:09:04.379 --> 00:09:09.779
also avoid expecting too much from our brothers and sisters.

00:09:09.779 --> 00:09:17.740
Such unreasonable expectations create stress, disappointment, and frustration.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:25.299
The awake of September 8, 1994 quoted a factory supervisor who said,

00:09:25.299 --> 00:09:28.820
you have to accept people as they are.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:35.460
If you expect more than they can give, you will elevate the stress level, making everyone

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:39.289
unhappy.

00:09:39.289 --> 00:09:46.490
We should expect from our fellow workers what Jehovah and Jesus expect from them.

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:54.570
Jesus' illustration of the talents recorded in Matthew chapter 25 conveys their thinking.

00:09:54.570 --> 00:10:01.090
The main point of this illustration is that the master Jesus expects each of his anointed

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:09.049
brothers, the slaves, and by extension those who are of the other sheep to do his or her

00:10:09.049 --> 00:10:14.970
best in the assigned work of preaching the good news.

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:18.169
How did Jesus distribute the work?

00:10:18.169 --> 00:10:23.570
Matthew chapter 25 verse 15 provides the answer.

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:32.610
He gave five talents to one, two to another, and one to still another, to each according

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:37.529
to his own ability, and he went abroad.

00:10:37.529 --> 00:10:44.570
Jehovah and Jesus are pleased with and will reward each of us when we do our best within

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:48.649
our circumstances and ability.

00:10:48.649 --> 00:10:54.889
When the slave of two talents gained two more, the master did not say to him, why did you

00:10:54.889 --> 00:10:58.850
not gain five more like your fellow slave?

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:06.169
He gave the two talents slave the same commendation as the one who was given the five and gained

00:11:06.169 --> 00:11:08.330
five more.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:13.049
Well done, good and faithful slave.

00:11:13.049 --> 00:11:15.450
You were faithful over a few things.

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:18.809
I will appoint you over many things.

00:11:18.809 --> 00:11:22.490
Enter into the joy of your master.

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:29.889
As a result, the two talents slave could be just as successful and joyful as the five

00:11:29.889 --> 00:11:32.129
talents slave.

00:11:32.129 --> 00:11:40.649
They both met their master's reasonable expectations, and their master was joyful too.

00:11:40.649 --> 00:11:45.889
What a fine lesson for all of us, including those serving as elders.

00:11:45.889 --> 00:11:53.370
In imitation of Jehovah and Jesus, we should never put pressure on our brothers to do more

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:56.129
than they're capable of doing.

00:11:56.129 --> 00:12:04.809
Earlier to take this reasonable and realistic approach, can result in much frustration.

00:12:04.809 --> 00:12:10.009
Another way that we show we have reasonable expectations is to acknowledge that from

00:12:10.009 --> 00:12:16.690
time to time, disagreements and hurt feelings will arise among our brothers.

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:22.490
Have you ever heard someone say, I expect to be treated that way by the world, but not

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:24.450
by my brother?

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:30.250
Is it reasonable to expect that there will not be any difficulties among brothers?

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.049
No.

00:12:32.049 --> 00:12:37.769
Does Jesus expect that at times his disciples will have difficulties among themselves?

00:12:37.769 --> 00:12:40.009
Yes.

00:12:40.009 --> 00:12:43.210
Why can we say this?

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:49.500
Remember some of the expressions Jesus used throughout the sermon on the Mount.

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:55.379
Happy are the peacemakers, since they will be called sons of God.

00:12:55.379 --> 00:13:00.139
If you are bringing your gift to the altar, and there you remember that your brother

00:13:00.139 --> 00:13:06.980
has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar and go away.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:15.620
First, make your peace with your brother, and then come back and offer your gift.

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:22.700
Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:27.899
Not judging that you may not be judged.

00:13:27.899 --> 00:13:34.419
These verses show that Jesus knew his disciples would have challenges among themselves.

00:13:34.419 --> 00:13:41.340
That was a realistic expectation, but it's also reasonable to conclude that these problems

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:46.899
can be successfully resolved if godly principles are applied.

00:13:46.899 --> 00:13:53.700
When peace can be restored, additionally, we should expect some tensions to arise among

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.139
the brotherhood today.

00:13:56.139 --> 00:14:04.019
But by applying Bible principles, peace can be restored and maintained.

00:14:04.019 --> 00:14:07.460
We'll now consider our third question.

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:14.419
Why is it realistic to expect that Jehovah will reward us for our faithful sacred service?

00:14:14.419 --> 00:14:21.299
In Hebrews 116, the Bible tells us that Jehovah is the rewarder of those earnestly seeking

00:14:21.299 --> 00:14:23.500
him.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:30.019
And at 1 Corinthians 1558, the Apostle Paul encourages us to have plenty to do in the work

00:14:30.019 --> 00:14:37.419
of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain.

00:14:37.419 --> 00:14:42.019
Paul was absolutely sure of his heavenly reward.

00:14:42.019 --> 00:14:48.340
Despite his sins prior to becoming a Christian and his battles with sinful inclinations, please

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:56.059
note his confidence, expressed at 2 Timothy chapter 4 verses 7 and 8.

00:14:56.059 --> 00:14:58.820
I have fought the fine fight.

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.580
I have run the race to the finish.

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:04.299
I have observed the faith.

00:15:04.299 --> 00:15:10.340
From this time on there is reserved for me the crowned of righteousness, which the Lord

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:17.179
the righteous judge will give me as a reward in that day, yet not to me only, but also

00:15:17.179 --> 00:15:21.740
to all those who have loved his manifestation.

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:27.059
We can have similar confidence in the reward Jehovah has promised.

00:15:27.059 --> 00:15:34.940
Whether our hope is heavenly, or to enjoy everlasting life on a paradise earth, this is

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:42.620
a realistic expectation because our reasonable and loving God has promised it and he does

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:44.460
not lie.

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:53.379
Therefore, may we develop and maintain realistic expectations for ourselves and for our fellow

00:15:53.379 --> 00:15:55.100
workers.

00:15:55.100 --> 00:16:01.299
May we never lose sight of the reality that Jehovah will reward those earnestly seeking

00:16:01.299 --> 00:16:03.659
him.

00:16:03.659 --> 00:16:09.740
If we have realistic expectations, we can find joy and success in our service to Jehovah

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:15.340
now, as well as have the prospect of doing so forever.
