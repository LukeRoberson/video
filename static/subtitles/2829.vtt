00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.579
O Jehovah, the God of Israel, sitting and thrown above the cherubes.

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.579
You alone are the true God of all the kingdoms of the earth.

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.579
Here, all the words as an acrifice sent to taunt the living God.

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:23.700
Kings of Assyria have devastated the nations in their lands.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.140
But now, O Jehovah, our God,

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:37.140
please save us out of his hands so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone are God, O Jehovah.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:56.530
You have come from Isaiah? Yes, my Lord.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.530
He says, this is what Jehovah says about the king of Assyria.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.530
The virgin daughter of Zion despises you.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.530
She scoffs at you.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.530
The daughter of Jerusalem shakes her head at you.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.530
Whom have you taunted and blasphemed?

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.530
It is against the holy one of Israel.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.530
Your rage against me and your roaring have reached my ears.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.530
So I will put my hook in your nose

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.530
and my bridal between your lips

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.530
and I will lead you back the way you came.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:03:31.009
Are you still sleeping?

00:03:31.009 --> 00:04:16.730
As you command, he stood.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.730
He stood.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:27.230
Not a mark on them.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.230
I was at my post, my Lord.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.230
All of the night, my King, I swear it.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.230
I heard nothing. I saw nothing.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.230
What are we to do?

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.230
My Lord, who could have done this?
