WEBVTT

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.349
You will be going home or to a new assignment.

00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:08.750
We want you to know that you will be missed.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.949
It was good for the Bethel family to have you with us.

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:16.149
It was a blessing from Jehovah.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:20.750
Like a pregnant woman, your bellies are swell to the limit.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:27.149
All the signs tell you that a baby is about to be born.

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:29.350
You're rushed to see the doctor.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.149
He examines you, and you ask,

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:33.149
when?

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.750
He says any day now.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.350
Your minds and hearts are about to burst with spiritual things

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.549
to deliver to others.

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:48.549
Yes, this is a day for delivering.

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:51.149
Your spirituality is contagious.

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.149
When you walk into a room, you bring sunshine with you.

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.549
Notice what Jesus said to some of His followers.

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:02.450
Matthew 5, 14-16,

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.349
you are the light of the world.

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:09.849
The city cannot be hid when located on a mountain.

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:14.250
People light a lamp and set it not under a basket,

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.650
but on the lamp stand and it shines on all those in the house.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.650
Likewise, let your light shine before men,

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.849
so that they may see your fine works and give glory

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:33.049
to your father who is in the heavens.

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.250
First of all, your spiritual brothers and sisters

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.750
are in the house with you.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.049
Shine on them, but don't limit it to them.

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.049
We want others to see the light.

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:51.650
For the past five months,

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.849
you have been studying the personality of Jehovah

00:01:55.849 --> 00:02:00.950
and talking to Him by means of prayer.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.950
While it's true,

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.150
humans cannot see the literal person, Jehovah.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:12.449
For Jehovah God to set down a description of Himself

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:17.550
in spirit terms would be like trying to explain colors

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.330
to a person born blind.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.430
You have been asking for Him

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.830
to help you in your studies,

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.530
and He has helped you.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.530
Without His help, you would not be graduating.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.330
Now you're ready as never before

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.330
to let your light shine on your fleshly family members,

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.330
your Bible students,

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.729
and your spiritual brothers and sisters.

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:53.830
But don't make it so bright and intense

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.430
that you put out the eyes of those around you.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.430
Turn the wick down in your lamp.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.430
There is no need to say every time.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.729
We were taught this in Gilead.

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:14.830
We were taught this in one of our Gilead classes.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.830
A member of the governing body called this

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.240
to our attention in a lecture he gave.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.840
You knew some things before you come to Gilead.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.039
You knew God's name is Jehovah

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:31.240
and that it is unique,

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.409
meaning the only one of its kind.

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:38.409
My name is Sam.

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:41.909
Samuel or Sammy.

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:44.409
It is not unique.

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:47.610
There are many others with the same name.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.810
I was named after my father's brother, Uncle Sam.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.009
Did you get that?

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:55.610
Uncle Sam.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.110
I did not name myself.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.210
A baby doesn't say when eight months in his mother's womb.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:08.889
Mommy, when I get out, call me Sammy.

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:12.490
God Almighty chose His name Jehovah.

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.590
He named Himself.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.389
That is different.

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.290
That is unique.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.490
You Gilead students soon to be Gilead graduates.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.490
No Jehovah, but not completely.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.389
Not the whole person, just the fringe.

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:38.490
Compare what you see to an ornamental edging

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.290
of hanging threads of a garment.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.829
You don't see the whole garment.

00:04:46.829 --> 00:04:50.129
Romans 11, 33 to 36 says,

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:54.730
all the depth of God's riches and wisdom and knowledge.

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.730
How unsearchable His judgments are

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:02.329
and beyond treason out His ways are.

00:05:02.329 --> 00:05:07.129
For who has come to know Jehovah's mind

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:10.730
or who has become His advisor

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:14.930
or who has first given to Him

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.129
so that it must be repaid to Him?

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:22.430
Because from Him and by Him and for Him

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.829
are all things.

00:05:24.829 --> 00:05:27.930
To Him be the glory forever.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.430
Amen.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.329
Jehovah 36, 26, tells us,

00:05:34.329 --> 00:05:38.930
yes, God is greater than we can know.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.930
The number of His years is beyond comprehension.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.029
No matter how much knowledge we have accumulated

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:51.329
in our brain, it amounts to a grain of sand

00:05:51.329 --> 00:05:56.829
on a seashore when we live forever.

00:05:56.829 --> 00:06:02.730
Forever, that is an interesting word.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.129
It is defined as never ending.

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:10.930
Incessantly ceaseless.

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:16.029
That's enough to blow an imperfect man's mind away.

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:18.730
But not Jehovah's mind.

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:23.230
And He promises obedient humans ever lasting,

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:28.089
never ending life.

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:30.189
I'm going to read a scripture to you

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:35.089
without revealing where it is found in the Bible.

00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:37.990
It is one of the first that captured my attention

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.790
back in 1956.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:44.189
Now, that was before any of you were born.

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:49.089
With that, I heard a loud voice from the Sronesee.

00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:54.689
Look, the tet of God is with mankind.

00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:57.290
And He will reside with them.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:00.589
And they will be His people.

00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:03.290
And God Himself will be with them.

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:07.990
And He will wipe out every tear from their eyes.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.189
And death will be no more.

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:17.790
Neither were morning nor outcry nor pain be anymore.

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:22.889
The former things have passed away.

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:24.990
Where in the Bible?

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:28.089
Revelation 21, 3 and 4.

00:07:28.089 --> 00:07:31.589
I knew you would know that one.

00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:34.589
We're limited to how much knowledge our brains

00:07:34.589 --> 00:07:38.290
can understand and sort out correctly.

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:42.389
Yes, one day we will know much more

00:07:42.389 --> 00:07:44.990
than we know today.

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:49.089
But we will not know it all.

00:07:49.089 --> 00:07:50.689
That's good.

00:07:50.689 --> 00:07:56.149
You will never be a know it all.

00:07:56.149 --> 00:08:00.850
Now is the time to let your light shine.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:04.050
Our work at the present is to inform people

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:08.250
that the kingdom of God, a heaven of government,

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:12.550
is the only remedy to the woes of mankind

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:19.120
that is causing so much suffering and death.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.920
Inform people of the kingdom.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.120
But don't blind them with your bright light

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.220
of knowledge learned at Gilead.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.420
A little light will be enough

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:35.559
for them to see where to go.

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:39.960
When I was in the army in Germany years ago,

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.759
I drove a truck with five men inside

00:08:42.759 --> 00:08:46.960
and M-101, howitzer artillery gun,

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.259
attached to the rear of the truck.

00:08:50.259 --> 00:08:52.659
We traveled during a pitch dark night

00:08:52.659 --> 00:08:55.059
with no lights used.

00:08:55.059 --> 00:09:01.159
We could only see the tail light of the vehicle in front.

00:09:01.259 --> 00:09:06.059
That was enough light to follow.

00:09:06.059 --> 00:09:11.659
Keep in mind, there may not be enough time left

00:09:11.659 --> 00:09:15.259
for your students and new brothers and sisters

00:09:15.259 --> 00:09:19.759
to learn all that you know.

00:09:19.759 --> 00:09:25.960
Feed them not a heavy meal of steak and baked potatoes

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:33.559
but an appetizer to stimulate the juices in the mouth.

00:09:33.559 --> 00:09:38.360
Any day now, nations will cause the peoples

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.259
who are looking to them for guidance

00:09:41.259 --> 00:09:47.860
to think they have finally established peace.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:51.360
The need for peace is already being talked about

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:55.059
by national leaders.

00:09:55.059 --> 00:10:01.559
We're not fooled by this sham cry of peace and security.

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:04.659
First, Cecilonian 5.3 says,

00:10:04.659 --> 00:10:09.960
whenever it is that they are saying peace and security,

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:15.960
then sudden destruction is to be instantly on them.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:21.360
Just like birth pains on a pregnant woman

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.659
and they will, by no means, escape.

00:10:25.659 --> 00:10:29.960
Jehovah will have the political powers of this world turn

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.460
against Babylon the Great.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.960
That's false religion.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:39.259
After they see the handwriting on the wall for her

00:10:39.259 --> 00:10:44.960
and destroy her, sudden destruction.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.860
Instantly, it won't take long.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:53.159
Her supporters will cry out weeping and mourning

00:10:53.159 --> 00:10:57.860
and say, too bad, too bad.

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:04.960
But we will be thinking, I'm glad, I'm glad.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.460
Revelation 18, 20 says,

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.659
be glad over her.

00:11:09.659 --> 00:11:15.860
Oh heaven, also you holy ones and apostles and prophets

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:22.860
because God has pronounced His judgment on her in your behalf.

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.460
Are you ready?

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:31.610
Are you ready to be glad over her destruction?

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:33.610
I think you are.

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:38.009
But I can't make that determination.

00:11:38.009 --> 00:11:43.610
We will know if we were ready as Jehovah protects us

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:49.009
when the nations turned their guns on us.

00:11:49.009 --> 00:11:52.610
Now is the time for us to continue

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:58.210
strengthening our faith and trust in Jehovah's love for us.

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:07.419
Study, meditate, associate, and preach the kingdom.

00:12:07.419 --> 00:12:11.220
Young David, when facing Goliath,

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:17.620
had five smooth stones in his pouch,

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.419
pouch of his shepherd's bag.

00:12:20.419 --> 00:12:22.620
He only used one.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:27.529
But he was prepared in case he needed more.

00:12:27.529 --> 00:12:31.629
When we read the Bible and meditate on it,

00:12:31.629 --> 00:12:36.730
our figurative heart absorbs God's Word,

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:42.129
like putting symbolic stones in our figurative heart.

00:12:42.129 --> 00:12:46.029
This gives us the inner strength we need

00:12:46.029 --> 00:12:48.830
to preach the kingdom message now

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:52.529
and to proclaim the hard-hitting judgment message

00:12:52.529 --> 00:12:57.730
that we may deliver in the near future.

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:05.559
The day for salvation will be clothed any day now.

00:13:05.559 --> 00:13:08.860
When Noah had gathered all the creatures

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:12.960
that Jehovah had designated along with all necessary food

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:18.960
needed for all in the ark, they went into the ark.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:24.659
Note it was Jehovah that closed the door, not Noah.

00:13:24.659 --> 00:13:27.159
Genesis 7 and 16 says,

00:13:27.159 --> 00:13:31.860
so they went in male and female of every sort of flesh

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:34.659
just as God had commanded him.

00:13:34.659 --> 00:13:40.360
After that, Jehovah shut the door behind him.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:44.759
We don't take it upon ourselves to close the door to salvation.

00:13:44.759 --> 00:13:46.860
Jehovah shuts the door

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:53.059
and we can't push it open to let mom or anyone else in.

00:13:53.059 --> 00:13:56.860
You, Gileadites, are professional preachers and teachers.

00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:00.059
You have received training that not many of your brothers

00:14:00.059 --> 00:14:03.460
and sisters will have the privilege to receive

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:06.860
this side of Armageddon.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:12.460
Yes, without a doubt, you are wiser now than you used to be,

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:16.960
but not as wise as Jesus was when He said,

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:20.360
what I teach is not mine,

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:26.059
but belongs to Him who sent me, John 7, 16.

00:14:26.059 --> 00:14:31.559
We believe Jehovah sent you to Gilead.

00:14:31.559 --> 00:14:35.259
Keep foremost in mind that what you teach

00:14:35.259 --> 00:14:39.460
belongs to Jehovah and conduct yourselves

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.759
in a manner that displays that.

00:14:42.759 --> 00:14:46.759
Let your light shine not too bright,

00:14:46.759 --> 00:14:51.059
just a flicker as needed before night falls.

00:14:51.059 --> 00:14:53.159
Any day now.
