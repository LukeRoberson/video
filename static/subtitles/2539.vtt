00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:08.689
I just went up to the lookout overlooking where we live here and all you see is water.

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:13.250
You see the trees and then underneath them just water it, everywhere.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.250
So it was pretty nerve-wracking.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.329
There was two firemen standing there and they said you got ten minutes, get out of the

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:21.329
house.

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:25.530
I took them off under two to sink in, that this was really happening, there was a sense

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:35.060
of urgency and confusion and potential disaster happening around you.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.420
The warnings were going on, so we couldn't drive onto our roads, we had to use the hills.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:56.890
You're pretty overwhelmed and I think in somewhat of shock because everything happened so fast.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.369
I went down the basement steps and there was muddy water.

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:16.980
This is a pretty stressful feeling, you know, how much damage is going to be done.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.980
Our mandate as a committee was to, first of all, make sure that all the brothers and sisters

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.140
were safe and accounted for.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.099
That was done with the cooperation of circuit overseers, local bodies of elders.

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:33.140
One of the first days we could go into high river, we found out about 830 in the evening

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.900
that we had to go ahead.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:45.739
By 7am to the next morning we had up 120 volunteers ready to go and that was very, very impressive,

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:48.859
very heartwarming to see that.

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:52.819
I didn't know the extent of the help that I would receive.

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:57.280
They're cleaning everything out for me.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.560
While the house here had water in it, three feet deep on the main floor, there are houses

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.480
around the area here that have had basements compromised, walls cave in.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.520
This water that was different here from some of the other areas in town is this was a river

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:22.419
coming through here.

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:28.180
This house here probably had somewhere around 3 to 4 inches of real heavy silk sitting

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.699
on the floor.

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:36.979
The Sheparding Program was an answer to prayers because you're just feeling so overwhelmed

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:43.259
and the brothers specially trained to help people with this traumatic event.

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:45.699
It was awesome.

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:47.659
This morning we probably had 100 here.

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:51.939
Jehovah's Holy Spirit, I mean, is very powerful and I wonder how these things happen so

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:52.939
fast.

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:54.939
How many brothers are here?

00:02:54.939 --> 00:03:01.060
Equipment, trucks, trailers to haul garbage away and then how organized it is shows

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.349
where Jehovah's Spirit is.

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:11.550
The ones that were helped were very grateful for the help.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.990
Some of them continue to get assistance from the brothers from the Sheparding side and

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.310
encouragement that way spiritually, but they really appreciated the hard work of the

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.310
Sheparding Program.
