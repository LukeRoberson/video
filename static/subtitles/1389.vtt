If you go to this career restaurant, you know, they have grilled meats and then you can also get barbecued and then you can lie down on the side.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.399
I'm so the soup and all these desserts. That's where we're going to go for lunch after service. Do you want to glass?

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:22.399
Let me check with a wife.

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:25.870
So, karma.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:49.060
I'm one of Joe's witnesses and can you completely simply phrase your read?

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.060
No, thank you.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.060
Okay, have a nice day.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.390
Wish you came to the door.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.390
I can't turn the witness to that thing.
