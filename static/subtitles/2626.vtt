WEBVTT

00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:07.620
While there is a lot of work to be done on a local level, there's an unprecedented global

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.099
effort to provide spiritual food to all of God's people.

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:16.859
Under the direction of the teaching committee of the governing body, the audio video services

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.899
department or AVS takes the lead in producing audio and video publications.

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:30.320
It's been said that if a picture is worth a thousand words, then a video is worth a

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.759
million videos stir our emotions, don't they?

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:37.920
And they can be very powerful teaching tools.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.520
Brother Russell recognized this fact.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.920
Back in 1914, the small group of Bible students presented the photodrama of creation to

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.159
over nine million people worldwide.

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:53.479
And the response was overwhelming.

00:00:53.479 --> 00:01:00.159
It was clear that Jehovah blessed their efforts at spreading the Bible's message in a visual

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:01.159
way.

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:08.200
Well, over a hundred years later, the faithful discrete slave is producing videos.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:16.480
And for many years, basically, one large public release video was being released or produced

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.480
each year.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:24.959
For example, back in 2011, the video faith and action part two was released.

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:31.840
It required a tremendous effort to produce the video master, the audio tracks, the graphics,

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.079
the music, the on-screen text for one video.

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:43.239
However, just five years later, the work has grown from producing an average of one

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:49.879
video per year to one video per day.

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:56.840
This is because videos are now a regular part of our website, the broadcasts, our ministry,

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.840
the conventions, meetings, and other special events.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.000
In 2016, more than 350 videos were produced.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Under the direction of the teaching committee, audio video services has been entrusted with

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.319
this work.

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:21.000
But with this rapid increase in the amount of videos produced, how is all this accomplished?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.240
Perhaps you've heard the expression, it takes a village.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.719
In this case, it takes an entire globe.

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:34.360
Please enjoy the following video for a close-up look at how audio and video work is accomplished

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.360
worldwide.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.360
Ready?

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:45.250
Action.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.889
To assist with the growing workload in audio video services, the governing body has approved

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:56.370
11 full-time regional video teams in branches around the world.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.169
But it doesn't stop there.

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:03.370
Bethelites, commuters, and remote workers in many other branches also provide valuable

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.370
assistance.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.409
How do we work with all these teams?

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:13.810
After receiving direction from the governing body committees for upcoming videos, AVS then

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.479
assigns each video to a capable team.

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:24.759
Once the team accepts the assignment, we provide them with a necessary direction as well

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:28.159
as answer any questions they may have.

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:47.620
Then the team goes to work.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.099
Because of being a small group, each team member may have to wear multiple hats to get

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:53.939
the job done.

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:59.900
From start to finish, they all work very hard to deliver a completed edited video to

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.060
us by the designated time.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:15.909
Later you may see these videos on JW Broadcasts, JW.org or other places.

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:22.350
Would you like to meet some of our RVT family?

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.189
It's a privilege.

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:32.310
We meet friends who have suffered some hardships and trials.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.029
But because of their trust in Jehovah, they were able to overcome them and we see the

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.709
results of their loyalty.

00:04:39.709 --> 00:04:48.870
I think it strengthens our determination to also stay loyal.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.350
We are a joyful team, with a lot of humour, and we work together very harmoniously.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.709
You could say that we are like a little family.

00:04:56.709 --> 00:05:00.550
We look forward to the next day when we go to work again.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.509
It's unbelievable how many dear brothers and sisters we've gotten to know through

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:06.430
these projects.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.149
This ties can develop and it is not uncommon that tears flow when the project is over and

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:14.790
it is time to say goodbye.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:21.790
Sometimes we would film on private or state property and I would have to approach the

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.829
manager and let them know what we were planning to shoot at the location.

00:05:26.829 --> 00:05:31.629
This wasn't easy for me because I'm not very good with words.

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:36.949
And many people in Korea tend to have a biased view of Jehovah's Witnesses so this made

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:41.189
it even harder for me.

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:46.750
So I pray to Jehovah asking for his guidance and wisdom.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:54.040
I was surprised to find that many were more than willing to help us.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:06:00.680
These experiences helped me to realise that Jehovah always answers our prayers for strength

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.680
and courage.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:12.639
You have to balance your time around work, around being ahead of family, being an elder

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:16.519
or other responsibilities that you have with congregation.

00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:24.040
That's when you really see Jehovah's Hand when you see the mountain of challenge but you

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.480
overcome it and you know it wasn't you.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.800
It was impossible for you to do it yourself.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:36.360
When I put even half the amount of energy and effort that I do into working for Jehovah

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:41.040
into something secular, I'm wiped out I need a vacation.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:47.160
But the more I put into working for Jehovah, the more I want to work.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.839
To know that you are offering your skills to Jehovah, that is a blessing.

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:58.160
But really the blessing is seeing your relationship with Jehovah thrive and be stronger and you

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:03.959
can see that he does keep his promises and that he supports you more than you're supporting

00:07:03.959 --> 00:07:06.600
him.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:12.720
Many of us aren't able to be full-time bethulites but commuting really helps us get that

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:18.560
small snippet of what it's like to be a bethulite and realise what a privilege it is.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.199
And if you've got a specific talent, use it.

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:26.839
One day in paradise someone's going to come to you and say, how did you use your talent?

00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:32.199
Maybe you're brilliant artist and you can proudly turn around and say, you know what, I used

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:33.959
for Jehovah.

00:07:33.959 --> 00:07:40.839
Even if you're young, you can learn skills and you can really assist Jehovah's organisation

00:07:40.839 --> 00:07:43.839
now and in the future.

00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:47.480
And there is no better boss to work for than Jehovah.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:51.800
My advice to young ones, go for it.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:58.399
During this past year, we were excited to add a new team to our AVS family located in

00:07:58.399 --> 00:08:02.800
Miroloma, California.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:07.040
All in this group have made themselves available for video needs out there.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:12.420
You're able to take a person, you're able to take an individual that has dedicated their

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:13.420
life to Jehovah.

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.860
And maybe they didn't know at the time that they were going to inspire somebody else and

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:21.899
have somebody somewhere across the planet say, wow, that's exactly my life too.

00:08:21.899 --> 00:08:28.180
I am so glad that this person was selected to be on here because that's my life.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:33.059
And that has triggered me to want to do more for Jehovah.

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:37.620
You know, Jehovah's Holy Spirit, he's putting together a team, he's the great producer.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.899
And what he really wants is he wants people that have the talent, but he wants people that

00:08:40.899 --> 00:08:44.419
have the Holy Spirit more and are willing to work for it.

00:08:44.419 --> 00:08:49.059
But he gives you the ability, like a holy ab and bezel, to be able to put your talents

00:08:49.059 --> 00:08:52.500
that you've learned to work for him.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:58.340
As you can see, we're part of a beautiful, hard-working, global team.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:03.740
With so many hands helping the load in so many time zones, we're literally working on

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:08.850
videos 24-7.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:12.889
It's a great privilege to work alongside our extended family.

00:09:12.889 --> 00:09:14.450
We learn from each other.

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:20.490
They're willing spirit, humble attitude, and contagious joy inspire all of us here in

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:21.490
ABS.

00:09:24.779 --> 00:09:31.100
Additionally, we receive incredible support right at home to virtually every department

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:39.860
at Bethel supports the audio video work in some way, and we are very, very thankful.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:45.179
With everyone's help, the Bible's message is being spread visually throughout the earth

00:09:45.179 --> 00:09:51.690
at unprecedented levels.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:54.889
But how is any of this possible?

00:09:54.889 --> 00:09:57.250
Brother Russell said it best.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:02.700
This is not man's work, it's God's.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.500
Jehovah is certainly at the helm.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:12.059
As he foretold at Haggai chapter 2 and verse 7, I will shake all the nations and the precious

00:10:12.059 --> 00:10:19.179
things of all the nations will come in, and I will fill this house with glory.

00:10:19.179 --> 00:10:26.580
There is certainly a great shaking taking place worldwide, and many of these precious ones

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:32.019
are offering themselves willingly to help audio video services accomplish this great

00:10:32.019 --> 00:10:33.019
work.

00:10:33.019 --> 00:10:37.940
Thanks to Jehovah God, our grand and visual instructor.
