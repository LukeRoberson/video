00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:10.789
An introduction to the book of Daniel. Daniel wrote this prophetic book in Babylon. He was

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:17.910
taken to Babylon, likely as a young Judean prince, along with other nobles. In time, Daniel served

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:25.579
as a government official for the Babylonians and later for the Meadow Persians. Daniel

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:33.500
opens his book by relating events that began in 618 BCE when he was still a young man. He

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:43.329
completed his writing in approximately 536 BCE. Obediah, Ezekiel, and Jeremiah were Daniel's

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:50.090
contemporaries. They lived during a tumultuous period of Israel's history that included the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.770
destruction of Jerusalem. Daniel witnessed the Meadow Persian conquest of Babylon and the

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:03.530
return of a faithful remnant of God's people to Jerusalem. However, he did not join those returning

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:10.859
to Jerusalem, likely because of his advanced age. The book of Daniel has twelve chapters.

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:18.459
Chapters 1 to 6 record in chronological order the experiences of Daniel and those of his three

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:25.260
companions. Chapters 7 to 12 contain Daniel's account of prophetic dreams and visions that he

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:34.620
received by inspiration. Chapters 1, 3 and 6 recount the various tests of integrity that Daniel and

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:41.140
his Hebrew companions successfully meet. As young men, they reject food and drink that would

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:48.299
make them unclean in God's sight. Sometime after this, Daniel's three companions, Shadrach,

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.739
Meshach, and Abednego, bravely face death in a fiery furnace for refusing to worship an

00:01:54.739 --> 00:02:01.840
image representing the Babylonian state. Years later, despite an official decree prohibiting

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:10.080
petitions to anyone but Dorias, Daniel perseveres in prayer to Jehovah, and as a result, is thrown

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:18.439
into alliance pit. With each test, Daniel and his companions maintain their integrity and Jehovah

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:26.560
protects them. Chapters 2 and 4 describe how Jehovah gives Daniel the ability to interpret two of

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:34.639
King Nebuchadnezzar's dreams. Each of these divinely sent dreams has prophetic significance. The

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:41.919
first dream is of an immense image made of various metals. This image represents successive world

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:48.240
powers that have had a major influence on God's people. The prophecy ends with the destruction

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:55.680
of these powers, and with God's kingdom as the only government ruling over mankind. Nebuchadnezzar's

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.240
second dream features a tree that reaches to the heavens. It is cut down, and the stump is

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:09.840
banded for seven times. This symbolizes an interruption of rulership. However, the stump is allowed

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:18.479
to remain, indicating a restoration of rulership. Chapter 5 relates that handwriting miraculously

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:25.360
appears on the wall of the palace where Babylonian King Belshazzar holds a feast. Daniel tells

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.879
Belshazzar that the handwriting warns of the conquest of Babylon by the Meads and the Persians.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:42.740
Babylon falls that very night. Did you know A large portion of the book of Daniel was written in

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:49.699
the Aramaic language. Aramaic was commonly spoken in ancient times, having the same letters in

00:03:49.699 --> 00:04:00.039
its alphabet as did Hebrew. Chapter 7 and 8 describe the visions Daniel sees of a series of

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:10.479
beasts that picture the rise and fall of Babylon, Medopersia, Greece, and Rome. Also, Jehovah gives

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:18.399
his son an everlasting kingdom that will replace all human governments. Chapter 9 relates that

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:24.319
Daniel discerns from his study of God's written word that the Jews release from captivity is imminent.

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:32.319
Next, we read that while Daniel is praying, an angel appears to him and reveals details concerning

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:41.120
the Messiah. Chapter 10-12 discuss the event when an angel again visits Daniel, encourages him,

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:48.079
and gives him an additional vision of the future. A large part of the prophecy describes a conflict

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:54.480
between two kings locked in a struggle for supremacy. The fulfillment of the prophecy would

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:02.160
extend to the final part of the days. The angel reassures Daniel of God's approval and tells him

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:08.079
that, although he will soon rest in death, he will stand up in the resurrection at the end of the

00:05:08.079 --> 00:05:19.199
days. As you read this book, note how much Jehovah values Daniel's faithfulness, how Jehovah

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:26.399
maneuvers kings in kingdoms according to his purpose, and how Jehovah gives his son an everlasting

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:34.959
kingdom that will replace all human governments.
