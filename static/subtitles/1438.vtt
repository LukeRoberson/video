00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:12.369
When I learned I was invited to work for a few weeks on the upcoming construction projects,

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:19.050
I was thrilled by their excitement, quickly turning to anxiety because of what I had to

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.050
do.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:44.350
I pray to Jehovah for weeks to give me the strength to have the conversation with my employer.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.030
So I wanted to first of all say thank you for taking it.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.030
I began to explain about a construction project and how it had been invited to volunteer.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.030
So you want time off during the busiest time of our year?

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.210
Well yes.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.209
It's your choice but under no circumstances will uphold your position.

00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:18.180
Suddenly this beautiful privilege felt like a huge risk.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.180
Was I making my life more complicated by doing this?

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:41.030
I read the account about the people in Nehemiah's day.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:51.030
Their will in spirit demonstrated faith and Jerusalem's walls were built by people who put their heart into the work.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:02:00.189
I didn't want to miss out on the opportunity to serve Jehovah in that way.

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:02.189
This is my resignation letter.

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:11.219
I had to have faith that Jehovah would bless my decision.

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:23.060
I'm not sure what the future holds when I get back but I know Jehovah will take care of me.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.060
For now I'm going to focus on putting my heart into the work.
