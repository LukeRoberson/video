00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:11.060
I received the phone call that a sister had passed away while giving birth.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:15.740
When people in the area had that a sister had died, they got angry.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:22.300
They assumed that a sister had died because of having refused the blood transfusion.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.379
On the day of the burial, there was a difficult situation.

00:00:27.379 --> 00:00:32.740
Some family members did not want Jehovah's Witnesses to carry out the funeral ceremony.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.299
They just took the coffin away and headed to the cemetery without giving us a chance to deliver the talk.

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:45.299
As soon as possible, we came up with an alternative plan since we saw their need for encouragement.

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:48.500
We decided to go to the Kingdom Hall to have the talk there,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:55.039
which made it possible for the brothers and sisters to be strengthened by the Kingdom Hall.

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:01.500
The news of what happened on this day spread like wildfire.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.420
We were nervous when we thought of going out in the ministry.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.659
So we had to rely on Jehovah to go and preach to the same people who had reacted aggressively at the funeral.

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:19.900
Without a doubt, Jehovah and his spirit helped us and we were able to preach to these people.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.340
We were also relieved when the medical officials explained why a sister died.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.299
That it was not because she refused the blood transfusion.

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.810
That really was an answer to our prayers.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.129
At first, the husband of the deceased sister was the only witness in his family.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.890
But eventually, after all of this took place, two of his relatives became Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.090
Another interesting fact is that two chiefs who were present at the funeral attended the memorial.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.890
The wrong view some people had toward us changed.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.969
Thanks to the power of the good news and the peaceable attitude of our brothers and sisters.
