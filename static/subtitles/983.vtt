00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:09.910
Imagine the scene. It's nighttime. You're in the Garden of Gethsemane with your close friends and beloved teacher.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:16.910
Suddenly, you hear a crowd coming. They're being led by a man you know, Judas Iscariot.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:25.910
He approaches Jesus and kisses him on the cheek. He then steps aside as men move into a rest Jesus.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.910
Your emotions turn inside you. Your master and Lord is being arrested. The Son of God.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:38.909
How can this be happening? What do you do before you can even decide what to do?

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:44.909
Peter draws his sword and chops off the ear of the slave of the high priest.

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:51.909
Then Jesus says to Peter, return your sword to its place.

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:56.909
For those who take up the sword will perish by the sword.

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:03.909
And then you watch the unbelievable as Jesus heals the man's ear.

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:09.909
Peter must have thought he was a great and noble thing to fight in behalf of the Son of God.

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:18.909
But Jesus didn't think so. With six words, return your sword to its place.

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.909
Jesus taught his disciples an important lesson.

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.909
This was not their fight, nor was it the time to fight.

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:37.909
So in this talk, we're going to focus our attention on an insidious way that any of us,

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:46.909
like Peter, can become inadvertently involved in this world's conflicts without even realizing it.

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.909
And we will talk about how we can avoid making that serious mistake.

00:01:52.909 --> 00:02:03.909
But first, let's discuss why Jesus did not ask his father to send 12 legions of angels to help him when being arrested.

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.909
It has to do with Jesus' name.

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:14.909
So please open your Bible to Isaiah chapter 9 and let's read verse 6.

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:21.909
Isaiah chapter 9 and verse 6. Now we know Jesus has many titles.

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:27.909
But in this verse, we're going to focus on on just one, verse 6.

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:35.580
For a child has been born to us. A son has been given to us.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.580
And the rulership will rest on his shoulder.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:46.580
His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.580
Why is Jesus called Prince of Peace?

00:02:50.580 --> 00:03:00.580
Well, consider what Jehovah's Angels declared to the shepherds in the field at Jesus' birth at Luke chapter 2 and verse 14.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:08.580
They said, Glory in the heights above to God and upon earth peace among men of good will.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:19.580
How appropriate for the angels to announce at the birth of the destined Prince of Peace that they would be divine peace for those who have God's good will.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:29.580
But when will this become a reality? It didn't happen when Jesus was on earth and we certainly don't see peace today instead of peace, what do we see?

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.580
We see the nations that are locked in hostilities and aggression and a competition for world dominance.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:42.580
We see global violence and bloodshed. But please don't lose heart.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.580
Because we don't see peace now does not mean it's not coming.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:56.580
Isaiah chapter 9 and verse 6. It's not just wishful thinking. It's a promise from Almighty God and Jehovah cannot lie.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:05.580
All his prophecies come true. In fact, let's read the last portion of verse 7 in Isaiah chapter 9.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:15.580
The last verse, the last portion of verse 7. It says, the zeal of Jehovah of armies will do this. What does that mean?

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:21.579
It means that Jehovah does nothing in a half-hearted way. He's zealous to bring peace and he will.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.579
We can be sure that whatever Jehovah promises he will fully accomplish.

00:04:26.579 --> 00:04:34.879
So how will peace come to the earth? Did the Prince of Peace give us a clue?

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:42.879
Yes, he did. In fact, the key to everlasting peace is on the lips of millions of people throughout the world.

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:53.819
They know it by heart. But let's read it at Matthew chapter 6 and verse 9 and 10.

00:04:53.819 --> 00:05:01.819
Matthew chapter 6 and verse 9. What a beautiful thought for us. This is where everlasting peace is going to come through.

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:09.819
It depends on the fulfillment of these verses. Verse 9. You must pray then this way.

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:16.819
Our Father in the heavens, let your name, the name Jehovah, be sanctified.

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:22.819
The emphasis that we place on the name of God is not merely a matter of religious knowledge.

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:27.819
Everyone must know God's name and treat it as something wholly and respected.

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:34.819
It has to be something sacred. It must be cleared of all the reproach that has been heaped upon it.

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:44.819
In fact, the well-being of the entire universe and its inhabitants depends upon the sanctification of Jehovah's name.

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:56.819
Now let's look at verse 10. Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place as in heaven also on earth.

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:08.819
God's kingdom. Two words, but so important. God's kingdom is the most powerful government humanity will ever see.

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:15.819
There is no nation or empire that can withstand the might of God's kingdom.

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:25.819
And any nation who thinks they can block the coming of God's kingdom is like an ant who plants itself firmly on the railroad track.

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:33.819
And with his hand raised, defiantly shouts to the oncoming locomotive, stop! You can't run over me.

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:41.819
Well, God's heavenly government has the power to destroy all present-day violent regimes. They're like ants to Jehovah.

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:48.819
And he will eliminate their ability to wage war, format, conflict, and to shed blood.

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:54.819
So yes, Matthew 6, 9, and 10, it's that valuable and important for lasting peace.

00:06:54.819 --> 00:07:10.819
God's kingdom is the only road to lasting peace. And in his role as king, Revelation chapter 19 and verse 15 describes Jesus as striking the nations with an iron rod.

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:19.819
Soon, Jehovah will give the command to his son, and he will destroy all the things that disrupt peace.

00:07:19.819 --> 00:07:25.819
God will be the terror that we have grown accustomed to living with day in and day out.

00:07:25.819 --> 00:07:32.649
So what will happen next? This is what will happen.

00:07:32.649 --> 00:07:47.649
Psalm 37, 10 and 11. Let's open our Bibles here to Psalm 37, 10 and 11, and just allow this prophecy to absorb and to thrill our minds and our hearts and give us a hope for the future.

00:07:47.649 --> 00:07:51.649
Verse 10, Psalm 37.

00:07:51.649 --> 00:07:58.649
Just a little while longer, and the wicked will be no more, a little while longer.

00:07:58.649 --> 00:08:07.649
You will look at where they were, and they will not be there. Just a little while longer, just like children saying to their parents going on a trip,

00:08:07.649 --> 00:08:17.649
are we there yet? And the parents say, just a little while longer, and that brings comfort to them, and it's the same with us.

00:08:17.649 --> 00:08:29.649
So imagine that. This means you go into the streets. You're looking for a wicked person. You would not be able to find even one the wicked will be no more.

00:08:29.649 --> 00:08:36.649
But the meek will possess the earth. That's what we're speaking about in verse 11. Let's read that.

00:08:36.649 --> 00:08:44.649
But the meek will possess the earth, and they will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:52.649
We love reading that. Men will be at peace. They will be at peace with themselves, with their neighbors, with their God.

00:08:52.649 --> 00:08:56.649
God, how does that sound to you? Meditate on that.

00:08:56.649 --> 00:09:04.649
Can you see yourself there in a peaceful new world, where the only news to tune into is regarding who's getting resurrected today?

00:09:04.649 --> 00:09:09.649
Which new person will you be assigned to teach about Jehovah?

00:09:09.649 --> 00:09:16.649
Can you imagine the joy of studying with a person, not just from a different culture, but from a different time period?

00:09:16.649 --> 00:09:30.120
Seeing things through their eyes, as they come to love Jehovah as you do, well soon the Prince of Peace will turn this world into one of sheer delight.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:39.120
No more borders, no more threats, no more worries, just an abundance of peace with your brothers and sisters.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:44.120
Do you want to be there? Me too.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:49.120
So how can we show our loyal support for the Prince of Peace?

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:55.120
Please watch the following video and notice the different ways we can do this right now.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:09.990
I am no part of the world, but is the world a part of me?

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:27.980
I'm pressured every day to get involved in political issues that affect me socially.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:46.570
Iron mentally and economically.

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:53.289
That pressure could rob me of my peace of mind.

00:10:53.289 --> 00:10:56.289
And influence how I think.

00:10:56.289 --> 00:11:08.710
I could take sides in my heart even if I'm not aware of it.

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:50.620
But I know that Jehovah will care for all of mankind's concerns by means of His kingdom ruled by His Son, Jesus Christ.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:55.899
I show my support for Him in my prayers.

00:11:55.899 --> 00:12:08.470
In how I think and feel.

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:13.470
And by teaching others what the kingdom will do for mankind.

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:19.470
I know there are millions of brothers and sisters all over the world.

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:24.470
Who lawyerly support the Prince of Peace just like me, because I...

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:29.610
I...

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:32.610
I am no part of the world.

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:44.090
So what takes away the peace in the country where you live, in your community, in your town, in your society?

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:48.090
Most likely it's the hot button social issues.

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:54.090
Did you notice how our two brothers and sisters showed their loyal support for the Prince of Peace?

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:56.090
What issues affected them?

00:12:56.090 --> 00:13:01.090
Unfair tax heights, blatant injustice, a disregard of the environment.

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:06.090
All things in themselves seem like noble causes worthy to get involved.

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:08.090
How can they get away with this?

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:11.090
It's not right. We should do something.

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:13.090
Does that sound familiar?

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:16.090
We may not have a literal sword in our hand.

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:19.090
But we all have our Peter-like moments.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:27.090
And if we're not careful, issues that are close to our heart can charge our emotions and we could lose our spiritual balance.

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:31.090
So what can help us when we see things that are wrong?

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:37.090
Remember what the Prince of Peace said to Peter in that highly charged moment.

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:41.090
Return your sword to its place.

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:44.090
In other words, this is not your fight.

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:46.090
So what do we do?

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:49.090
We do something far better than fight.

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:50.090
We preach.

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:57.090
Each time that we share the Kingdom news, we proclaim our support for Jesus' rule.

00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:59.090
But here's the thing.

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:07.090
If we truly believe in the good news of the Kingdom, we will not do anything that hinders our ability to tell it.

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:10.090
Once again, it's so important.

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:19.090
If we truly believe in the good news of the Kingdom, we will not do anything that hinders our ability to tell it.

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:20.090
Why?

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:21.090
Let's find out.

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:29.850
Let's open up to Peter's words himself, Peter 1 Peter 2 and verse 12.

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:32.850
First Peter 2 and verse 12.

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:38.850
Peter helps us here with why we need to maintain our conduct properly.

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:40.850
First Peter 2, 12.

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:50.850
Maintain your conduct fine among the nations so that when they accuse you of being wrongdoers, they may be eyewitnesses of your fine works.

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:55.850
And as a result, glorify God in the day of his inspection.

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:58.850
So Peter had to learn this.

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:00.850
But do we see the connection?

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:04.850
Our actions and words are directly linked to Jehovah.

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:09.850
When people see us, they see it people that worships Jehovah.

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:14.850
And when people hear us, they hear of people that worship Jehovah.

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:23.850
Imagine how our freeness of speech to speak about God's Kingdom would be hindered if we were to voice a position for a political issue.

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:26.850
And it can happen so easily.

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:30.850
It can happen at work or at school with relatives and so forth.

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:33.850
Satan sets the trap masterfully.

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:35.850
He's just waiting.

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:42.850
If he can only make us chop off the ear of anything in this world that causes hurt and indignation in our heart.

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:50.850
If he can hook our heart strings by getting us emotionally charged, he can then step back and reel us in.

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:56.850
The new world, our hope for true peace, it all starts to fade into the background.

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:59.850
Don't give him that chance.

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:05.850
Be determined to do what Titus chapter 3 and verse 1 and 2 tell us.

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:07.850
Let's read that.

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:15.370
Titus chapter 3 and verse 1 and 2.

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:20.370
Here's the scriptural admonition.

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:28.370
Continue reminding them to be in subjection and to be obedient to governments and authorities.

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:30.370
To be ready for every good work.

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:33.370
To speak injuriously of no one.

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:40.370
Not to be quarrelsome, but to be reasonable displaying all mildness toward all men.

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:46.370
Be in subjection and be obedient to governments and authorities.

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:49.370
Now let's break that down in practical terms.

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:50.370
What does it mean?

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:54.370
It means to obey the laws of the land and pay taxes.

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:58.370
Not to speak negatively about the superior authorities.

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:04.369
To be careful not to take sides on political issues, not even in our hearts.

00:17:04.369 --> 00:17:07.369
Do you remember that expression from the video?

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:12.369
I'm not a part of the world, but is the world a part of me.

00:17:13.369 --> 00:17:18.369
Of course, when we find ourselves between Caesar's law and God's law, we know what to do.

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:23.369
We apply Acts chapter 5 and verse 29 and obey God as ruler rather than men.

00:17:23.369 --> 00:17:24.369
We know that.

00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:29.369
But like Jesus who healed the ear of the armed guard Malcus,

00:17:29.369 --> 00:17:39.190
we're determined to react with mildness when provoked by an injustice or cruelty in this world.

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:43.190
In conclusion, we have the indescribable privilege

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:50.190
to honor the Prince of Peace and how reassuring it is to know that Jesus understands our feelings.

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:56.190
He understands our emotions when we see things that we know are wrong.

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:59.190
He knows these things hurt our heart.

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:02.190
We just want to make things right.

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:08.190
But remember the critical lesson he taught his apostles in the Garden of Gethsemane.

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:14.589
This is not your fight.

00:18:14.589 --> 00:18:20.589
Rather, Jehovah the King of Eternity and Jesus the Prince of Peace are telling us,

00:18:20.589 --> 00:18:22.589
this is our fight.

00:18:22.589 --> 00:18:24.589
Leave it in our hands.

00:18:24.589 --> 00:18:30.589
Soon the prophecy at Isaiah chapter 9 verse 6 and 7 will be fulfilled completely.

00:18:30.589 --> 00:18:34.589
In the meantime, keep preaching about the kingdom.

00:18:34.589 --> 00:18:39.589
Avoid saying or doing anything that suggests taking sides on a political issue.

00:18:39.589 --> 00:18:45.589
Don't allow yourself to chop off the ear of the injustices and the causes of conflict of this old world.

00:18:45.589 --> 00:18:49.589
Peter tried that, but it didn't work.

00:18:49.589 --> 00:18:54.589
He learned a big lesson that day in the Garden and he never forgot it.

00:18:54.589 --> 00:18:56.589
May we never forget it either.

00:18:56.589 --> 00:19:02.589
Now is the time to show your active and loyal support for the Prince of Peace

00:19:02.589 --> 00:19:07.589
as we echo Peter's words at 2 Peter 3.14

00:19:07.589 --> 00:19:12.589
and do our utmost to be found finally by Jehovah and the Prince of Peace,

00:19:12.589 --> 00:19:16.589
spotless and unblemished and in peace.
