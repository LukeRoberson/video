00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:13.199
Father, for me, the time has now come,

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:16.960
fulfilling the words that were said by your son.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.199
If they persecuted me, then they'll do it to you.

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:25.199
It's not a surprise, really, nothing that's new.

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.199
Jehovah, I pray, please, let me be strong.

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.200
My life and devotion to you, they belong.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.039
My record of faith will never be lost.

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:41.039
I'll be loyal to you, no matter the call.

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:49.390
To talk, talk to threats, enduring in faith.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:01:07.230
I won't give...
