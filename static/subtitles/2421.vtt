00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:13.619
When we were woven in the depths of the earth

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:22.699
Before we even came into this world

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:27.699
Jehovah saw right from the start

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:36.090
Deep down inside our beating heart

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.090
Just stop and think what that means

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.090
He knows you, He knows me

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.090
What we feel, what we see

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.090
When we try hard to give our best

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.090
The joys we feel and our regrets

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.090
He knows you, He knows me

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.090
What we need, what we believe

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.090
When we can't find the words to say

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.090
We're not alone

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:19.030
He knows like a father

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.030
Wants his child to succeed

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:31.280
That's how he feels about you

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.280
He sifts through us and sees

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.280
Where we shine

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.849
And who we can be in paradise

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:50.379
So always know that he cares

00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:53.379
He knows you, He knows me

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:57.379
What we feel, what we see

00:01:57.379 --> 00:02:00.379
When we try hard to give our best

00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:04.379
The joys we feel and our regrets

00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:07.379
He knows you, He knows me

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:10.379
What we need, what we believe

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:18.300
And not alone

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:28.599
He knows like a father

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.599
Wants his child to succeed

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.599
That's how he feels about you

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:49.340
He knows you, He knows me

00:02:49.340 --> 00:03:07.000
What we feel, what we see

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
When we try hard to give our best

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
The joys we feel and our regrets

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
He knows you, He knows me

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
What we feel, what we see

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
When we try hard to give our best
