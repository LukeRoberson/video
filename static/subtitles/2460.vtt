00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:08.099
Although many of our construction projects are the result of growth in a branch territory,

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:15.619
our donations also are put to good use when disaster strike.

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:20.820
The organization is quick to respond to the needs of our brothers and sisters in affected

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.539
areas.

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:27.500
This includes the distribution of release supplies.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:35.100
It also involves helping our brothers repair or rebuild their homes and kingdom halls.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:44.219
This was the case in 2011 when a large tornado ripped through the state of Missouri in the

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.990
United States.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.630
When a disaster strikes, the disaster relief does take the lead in caring for the needs

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:53.829
of the field.

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.229
This is done by using volunteers.

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:58.350
Our brothers know how to work together.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.270
We're using volunteers that are used to crawling over each other and working in a kingdom hall.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:08.310
So they have the ability to get into a disaster situation and take direction and just take

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.310
care of it.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.829
It's an evaluation process to see what's needed.

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:17.069
Then the purchasing department locally will then go ahead and start buying materials.

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:21.790
Those will be delivered and volunteers will come to prepare the home back to livable

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.349
conditions so that our brothers and sisters can get back into their homes.

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:31.510
So we stabilize the friends, we stabilize the houses, we can stabilize the congregation.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.150
We had a group of brothers that went in to drop them as early after the tornado destroyed

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.670
30% of the city.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.510
We had probably 30, 40 volunteers working on the house.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.189
And a woman comes down the street from the neighborhood.

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.469
She sees all the volunteers working.

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:48.269
She thinks it's a construction organization.

00:01:48.269 --> 00:01:51.590
She says, can I pay you to come over and fix my garage?

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.189
It was basically a shed that had been picked up off the slab and turned upside down and

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.989
moved a few feet away from the slab.

00:01:58.989 --> 00:02:00.989
So the brothers said, well let's go take a look at it.

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:03.349
So they went over and they took a look at it.

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:04.989
It wasn't that hard.

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:06.430
The shed was still intact.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.430
They said we could do this in a few minutes.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.750
So they went and got all their volunteers.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.030
They went over, they picked the shed up, they got about 30 brothers on it and they turned

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.669
it over and put it on the slab.

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:19.189
And the woman was so thankful, she says, okay, so what do I owe you?

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:20.590
They said, no, we're all volunteers.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.590
We're joe is witnesses.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.150
We're working through the local kingdom hall here, a relief center.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.110
And she says, you're kidding me, you're all volunteers.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.909
She says, yeah.

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:29.909
And we're out.

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:30.909
She says, what are you doing here?

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:35.949
So we're out working on our brothers and sisters homes and trying to help them get stabilized.

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:37.469
She was in tears.

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:42.310
She came back down the street a few minutes later with a lot of money in her hand.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.949
She said, I want to tell you a story.

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:49.870
She says, I called my church after this happened and I asked them to come work, do this work

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.110
for me, to put this shed back on its slab.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.550
They said, we can do that, we'll be there in about three weeks and it's going to cost

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.349
you this much.

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.389
She says, and here you folks come over to my house, you don't charge me, you don't even

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:07.229
know who I am and you put my home back together.

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:10.270
What I needed have done, she says, here's the money.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.710
You have this, you put it in your contribution box.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:18.629
When someone helps in building a kingdom hall, when someone helps in building an assembly

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:26.550
hall, when someone aids in caring for a natural disaster, their lives are changed forever.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:36.129
When someone is benefited by one of these programs, their lives are changed forever.

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:44.490
The love demonstrated in the organization is truly faith strengthening to see.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:51.289
The same arrangement to respond to disasters is in place all around the world.

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:55.810
It is your contributions that make this possible.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.050
For this we sincerely thank you.
