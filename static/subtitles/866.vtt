00:00:01.780 --> 00:02:09.789
What's right to be switched into more new love?

00:02:09.789 --> 00:04:26.370
Evidence is a dream

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.370
By those you choose

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:37.579
They're conduit in their predication

00:04:37.579 --> 00:05:19.660
What's right to be switched?

00:05:19.660 --> 00:06:57.139
Touch my thoughts, my Asian

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:18.420
The words I speak was not foresaw

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:32.750
You saw my thoughts, words, eyes and praise

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:45.120
And spot my soul

00:07:45.120 --> 00:09:23.940
Not in front, not in the grain

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:37.399
The sea, not in the dawn
