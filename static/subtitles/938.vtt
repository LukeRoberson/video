00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:09.570
We are living in critical times.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.570
Hard to deal with.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.570
Many people have lost all hope.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:23.570
And servants of Jehovah are not free from trials.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.570
We may face loss of property.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.570
Loss of health.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:37.380
Loss of loved ones.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.380
We may experience deep emotional trauma.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.380
Or even imprisonment for our faith.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:53.770
Our trials are similar to those of Job.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:00.770
A faithful servant of Jehovah who was so saddened that he once asked,

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.770
why didn't I die at birth?

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.140
Perhaps we've had moments like that.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.140
But why should we not lose hope?

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:21.129
Because with every trial comes Jehovah's support.

00:01:21.129 --> 00:01:25.129
Support received in many forms.

00:01:25.129 --> 00:01:42.400
Material support.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.400
Emotional support.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:02:03.430
And spiritual support.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:19.889
And while Jehovah will not remove all our trials now,

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:22.889
we trust that with his support,

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:32.460
we can endure them until they disappear in the real life to come.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.460
Psalm 34, 17 and 18 says,

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.460
they cried out and Jehovah heard.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.460
He saves those who are crushed in spirit.
