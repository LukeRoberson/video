00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:07.419
An introduction to First Kings.

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:13.419
First and Second Kings were originally one volume, which was later made into two.

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:17.420
Jeremiah is believed to be the writer.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.420
First Kings continues where Second Samuel leaves off.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:30.420
The account covers a period of some 129 years, beginning about 1040 BCE with King David's final days,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.420
and ending in about 911 BCE when King Jahashifat dies.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:44.420
In the first part of the book, after the death of King David, Israel enjoys peace and prosperity under Solomon's rule.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:51.420
In the second part, false worship takes root, and Israel is split into two kingdoms.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.530
In chapter 1, Solomon is anointed as King.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:08.030
In chapter 3, Jehovah blesses King Solomon with extraordinary wisdom, along with riches and glory.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.030
In chapter 4, God's people prosper under Solomon's rule.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:23.030
Chapters 5 through 8 discuss the construction of the temple, the making of its utensils, and Solomon's dedication prayer.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:31.030
In chapter 10, the queen of Shiba hears a report about Solomon, and then travels to Jerusalem to see him.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.030
After observing the king's wisdom and prosperity, she says,

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.030
Look, I had not been told the half.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:47.760
In chapter 11, Solomon and disobedience to Jehovah loved many foreign women.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:56.760
These pagan wives gradually incline Solomon's heart to worship other gods, including Ashtarath and Milcom.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:03.760
After reigning for 40 years, Solomon dies, and his son Reoboam takes the throne.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.759
In chapter 12, Reoboam promises to add to the already heavy burden on the people.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.759
Ten tribes revolt and make Jeroboam their king.

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:18.759
Reoboam is left with the tribes of Judah and Benjamin.

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:26.759
Jeroboam sets up the worship of golden calves to discourage his subjects from worshiping in Jerusalem.

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:35.759
Idolatry becomes entrenched in the northern kingdom, and this leads to oppression, power struggles, and assassinations.

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:47.710
In chapters 14 and 15, Reoboam and Abijum, after him, allow false worship to take root in the southern kingdom.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.710
Did you know?

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:57.710
About 33 years after Solomon inaugurated the temple, Jehovah allowed Pharaoh's shy shack to plunder its treasures.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:07.699
This shows that Jehovah is pleased not by impressive buildings, but by pure worship.

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:14.699
In chapter 15, Asa becomes king in Jerusalem, and he does what is right in God's eyes.

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:19.699
He is succeeded by his son, Jahashafat, who imitates his good example.

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:25.699
The next chapter mentions a number of wicked kings in the northern kingdom.

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:30.699
These include Ahab, who marries the pagan princess Jezebel.

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:34.699
She and her husband bring bail worship into the kingdom.

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:44.699
In chapter 18, the prophet Elijah proposes a test on Mount Carmel to show who is the true God, Jehovah or bail.

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:48.699
Jehovah demonstrates that he is the true God.

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:55.699
In chapter 19, Elijah flees for his life when he receives a death threat from Jezebel.

00:03:56.699 --> 00:04:02.699
Jehovah appears to Elijah at Mount Horeb and comforts him in a calm, low voice.

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:05.699
He gives Elijah further assignments.

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:12.699
In the final chapter, Ahab disregards the prophet Micaiah's warning against fighting Syria.

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:16.699
As a result, Ahab is killed in battle.

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:20.699
His son Ahaziah takes the throne in Israel.

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:30.000
Later, Jahashafat also dies, and his son Jahorum becomes king in Judah.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000
As you read first kings, note how false worship leads to great suffering.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
See how true worship promotes peace and happiness.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:51.000
And take comfort that Solomon's wisdom pales in comparison to that of Jesus Christ, the incorruptible king of God's kingdom.
