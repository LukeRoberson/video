When we offer a printed publication in our ministry, we try to have a basic knowledge of its contents.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.910
Likewise, when we feature JW.org using publications in our teaching toolbox,

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.910
we want to have a basic knowledge of how to find information on the website.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:27.800
For example, if we offer a contact card and simply say that the website has a lot of good information,

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.799
that may not be enough to motivate our listener to visit the site.

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:37.799
But mentioning something specific could peak a person's curiosity.

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:39.799
You could say to the person,

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:44.799
you might be surprised to know that one of the most popular questions answered is,

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:47.799
what does the Bible say about tattoos?

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:51.799
Another is, what does 666 mean?

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:58.000
You too may find the answers interesting.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
These articles can be found by typing tattoos or 666 in the search box.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
You can also use the website to help people who have specific questions.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:19.700
For example, where can you find information that would appeal to someone who doubts that God exists?

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:27.700
On the homepage, click Bible teachings, then Science in the Bible.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:38.730
There you will find interviews and well-documented articles that support the existence of a creator.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.730
Where could you find information that would help an inactive publisher?

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:56.329
To find the brochure, return to Jehovah, type in the search bar, then click the search button.

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:04.049
Or what if someone asks you how our work is financed?

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:12.050
At the top of the homepage, click About Us, then click About Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:18.050
There you will find a link to the article, how is the work of Jehovah's Witnesses financed?

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:29.599
If we can navigate JW.org, we can help people of all sorts to accept the good news.
