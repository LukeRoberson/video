00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:09.509
Today's text reminds us of our loving God, Jehovah, and what he's done for you and for me and all humans.

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:15.310
He is the originator of marriage. Yes, he is the marriage bond maker.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:21.809
So his purpose, from the very beginning, from Adam and Eve to our day, was that they would stick together,

00:00:21.809 --> 00:00:29.010
that they would be one flesh, be bonded together, and it would be a permanent and lasting and happy relationship.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:35.509
But here's the problem. On the other hand, we have Satan, who is the original bond breaker.

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:44.009
He wants to break marriages and families. He wants to get in between your marriage and my marriage and cause a wedge.

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:48.509
So what will make or break our marriage?

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:57.009
Well, the key is to the extent to which we show and prove our love to Jehovah and be loyal to his commandments,

00:00:57.009 --> 00:01:02.509
including the marriage arrangement and our love and our loyalty to our mate.

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:10.510
We must also prove our hatred for what Satan has done and is doing today by breaking up families and marriages,

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:18.510
and making sure that nothing will interfere with the tight bond and secure bond that we have within our marriage.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.010
When the marriage bond breakers, the Pharisees were trying to test Jesus in his day,

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:31.510
do you remember what Jesus did? Well, the first thing he did was go back and quote what Jehovah said about Adam and Eve.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:37.310
So if you go to your Biobles, let's go to Matthew chapter 19 and verses 5 and 6.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.109
And Jesus tells these Pharisees that, didn't you read about this already?

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:46.510
In verse 5, he goes on to say, for this reason,

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:54.510
a man will leave his father and his mother, and he will stick to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.510
So he quoted exactly what Jehovah said, but then he went a little bit further in verse 6.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.510
He says, so that they are no longer two, but one flesh.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:10.509
Therefore, what God has yoke together, let no man put apart.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.009
It's interesting that our study notes help us to appreciate what stick to means.

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:22.509
Literally, it means to glue, to join or bind closely together to cling to.

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:28.009
So when it comes to a union of a husband and wife, they need to be glued together.

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:34.009
What about the term one flesh? They could also mean one body, one person.

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:40.509
It describes the closest bond between a husband and wife, inseparable companions.

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:47.509
It says in a study note that such a union cannot be broken up without damage to the partners bound by it.

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:53.509
So something that's supposed to be permanently glued, you try to tear it apart, there will be problems.

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:58.509
People often say when newly married couple gets married that they tied the knot.

00:02:58.509 --> 00:03:00.509
I think we've all heard that.

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:06.509
But unfortunately, some couples and many couples go from being stuck on their partner,

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:15.509
being attracted to them because of maybe looks or because of things in common, to actually being stuck with them.

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:16.509
Big difference.

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:22.509
They quickly want to untie the knot, separate the bond, and become unglued.

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:25.509
That's many in the world, but that's not you.

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:27.509
And that's not Jehovah's people in general.

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:32.509
Millions are enjoying a happy, successful marriage.

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:37.509
Well, what are these marriages missing? Why are they becoming unglued?

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:40.509
Well, they don't have the right kind of glue.

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:48.509
Well, what is the glue that will bond your marriages, your marriage and all marriages around the world? What do we need?

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:57.509
Notice what Paul tells us in Colossians chapter three in verse 14, the secret to success, the glue that bonds us together.

00:03:57.509 --> 00:04:01.509
Colossians three in verse 14.

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:08.509
He says, love. Love is a perfect bond of union.

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:18.509
That's the glue that is missing in most marriages, not a romantic type of love, but the attachment that will not let go, that will continue to be bonded.

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:21.509
Not only the couple, but with Jehovah.

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:27.509
As we know, if we're trying to glue something together with wood glue or plastics or some kind of adhesive,

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:36.509
there's many different types of components or ingredients within glue that give it maximum holding power or strength.

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:40.509
What are the bonding ingredients or materials found in love?

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:48.509
If you're still in Colossians chapter three, Paul lists many bond makers, as well as bond breakers.

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:53.509
Let's go through the list of bond breakers so we know what to avoid.

00:04:53.509 --> 00:05:06.509
There in Colossians chapter three, notice verse five, the bond breakers are sexual immorality, uncleaness, uncontrolled sexual passion, hurtful desire, and greediness.

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:09.509
Total selfishness, we see this in most marriages today.

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:17.509
Verse eight goes on to say, wrath, anger, badness, abusive speech, and obscene talk, verse nine, line.

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:23.509
Well, these are things that will tear our marriage apart. It will not keep it together.

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:31.509
So we know this, but we need to ask ourselves, if I know this, why would I want to bring it to my marriage, anything that would tear it apart?

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:37.509
In appropriate material, entertainment, pornography.

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:44.509
Why would I form an attachment, an emotional attachment with someone who is not my mate or flirt with them?

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:54.509
It would break the marriage bond. Why would I speak in such a harsh sarcastic, critical way to my best friend, to my marriage mate?

00:05:54.509 --> 00:06:02.509
Before using glue and trying to put something together, both surfaces need to be clean.

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:05.509
That's in a physical way, but also with the marriage itself.

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:11.509
We need to make sure that everything is removed that would prevent permanent bonding.

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:17.509
So we need to have a clean conscience and be clean with what we think and what we see and what we do.

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:23.509
So what are the bond makers that will help us, that will help love be part of our marriage?

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:27.509
What are the ingredients? Notice Colossians chapter three in verse 12.

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:39.509
It says we're to put on, as though we strip off the old things, clothe ourselves with tender affections of compassion, kindness, humility, mildness, and patience.

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:42.509
These are keys to our success.

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:49.509
And in verse 13, we should continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely.

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:52.509
So these will lead to a happy family life.

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:56.509
We all want to be happier than we are now.

00:06:56.509 --> 00:07:05.509
It's been said that the first to apologize is the bravest, the first to forgive is the strongest, and the first to forget is the happiest.

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:08.509
So that's the key to success as well.

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:14.509
And there are many fine examples in the Bible and modern day examples that we can try to imitate.

00:07:14.509 --> 00:07:19.509
One of the couples that come to my mind from the Bible is Aquila and Priscilla.

00:07:19.509 --> 00:07:21.509
And what do we know about them?

00:07:21.509 --> 00:07:23.509
Amazingly, they were always together.

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:26.509
One was never mentioned without the other.

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:29.509
They were in their theocratic activities and their social life.

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:33.509
They were together and they were running the race for life together.

00:07:33.509 --> 00:07:35.509
And we appreciate how they were bonded together.

00:07:35.509 --> 00:07:37.509
It made them a success.

00:07:37.509 --> 00:07:38.509
We want to imitate that.

00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:45.509
And all the modern day examples that help us to appreciate that we want to continue to stick together.

00:07:45.509 --> 00:07:47.509
We're all running in the race for life.

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:48.509
That's true.

00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:51.509
But if we're married, we're not running alone.

00:07:51.509 --> 00:07:54.509
We have our partner, and we need to run with them.

00:07:54.509 --> 00:07:58.509
It's sort of like running in a three-legged race.

00:07:58.509 --> 00:08:00.509
What is a three-legged race?

00:08:00.509 --> 00:08:05.509
Well, it's when two people are joined together at the ankle and they run to the finish line.

00:08:05.509 --> 00:08:10.509
Here, we have Caleb and Sofia's parents helping us to demonstrate this for us.

00:08:10.509 --> 00:08:14.509
They're tied together, but how do we know that their marriage will be successful?

00:08:14.509 --> 00:08:17.509
Well, first, the partners must remain tied.

00:08:17.509 --> 00:08:20.509
It must be bound together, permanent.

00:08:20.509 --> 00:08:27.509
They need to cling tightly to their partner, support them, stabilize them if they were to stumble or fall.

00:08:27.509 --> 00:08:36.509
They need close communication to start off on the right foot and continue to run in the same direction toward the same goal.

00:08:36.509 --> 00:08:42.509
And it's vital that they run together, move as one body, one flesh, not two,

00:08:42.509 --> 00:08:48.509
and in harmony with synchronized steps and run in the same pace at the same speed.

00:08:48.509 --> 00:08:50.509
And they will be successful.

00:08:50.509 --> 00:08:56.509
Likewise, when it comes to your marriage and my marriage, we need partners that are strong.

00:08:56.509 --> 00:08:59.509
That will support us. That will stabilize us.

00:08:59.509 --> 00:09:06.509
Work together to achieve goals that will make Jehovah happy and in turn make us happy.

00:09:06.509 --> 00:09:09.509
Communication is the key to our success.

00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:16.509
We can reach the finish line together with this bonding and with Jehovah in the marriage.

00:09:16.509 --> 00:09:21.509
But what if our partner were to fall or feel down?

00:09:22.509 --> 00:09:28.509
Ecclesiastes 4.10 says, for if one of them falls, the other can help his partner up.

00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:38.509
So if our partner is stressed out, anxiety, emotionally spent, feeling down, we can pick them up by giving them our full attention.

00:09:38.509 --> 00:09:42.509
Yes, we're busier than ever with our work assignments. And we're trying to exercise.

00:09:42.509 --> 00:09:44.509
We're trying to be with all of our friends.

00:09:44.509 --> 00:09:53.509
But that cannot overshadow the communication that is needed with our best friend, our running mate, our wife or our husband.

00:09:53.509 --> 00:10:00.509
So we need to put the work away, put down our device, and give undivided attention to our partner.

00:10:00.509 --> 00:10:10.509
And each day we want to communicate through prayer, talk to Jehovah, the three of you, and make Jehovah part of that marriage.

00:10:10.509 --> 00:10:15.509
And that's what Ecclesiastes 4.12 says, that a three-fold cord cannot quickly be torn apart.

00:10:15.509 --> 00:10:18.509
So just love between a man and a woman is not enough.

00:10:18.509 --> 00:10:23.509
We need Jehovah to make it the strongest and happiest possible.

00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:31.509
So as you keep Jehovah as a central strand in your marriage, you will be married at heart, you will stick together with the right kind of glue.

00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:36.509
Yes, love. The perfect bond of union that will never fail.
