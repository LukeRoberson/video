00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.660
Every day we make choices that can affect our relationship with Jehovah.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.660
When there's a clear scriptural command, the right choice may seem easy.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.660
But what if there's not?

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.660
How can we be sure we're making a wise decision?

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.649
An invitation to our niece's wedding arrived.

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:34.320
Thomas was excited about it.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.320
I was excited too.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.399
But the ceremony was being held at a local church.

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:48.710
I wondered if it would still be okay for me to attend.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.710
Even though Thomas wasn't yet willing to accept a Bible study,

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.710
he gradually softened over the years since I came into the truth.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.710
I knew he understood why I would never enter a church for worship.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.710
But what about attending a wedding?

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.709
Jehovah approves of weddings.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.790
That afternoon, I went to help Amy plan a menu for the Pioneer School lunch coming up.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:22.189
She noticed I was a bit distracted.

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.189
So I told her my concerns about the wedding.

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.189
But you're not thinking of going, are you?

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.189
Amy sure had a strong opinion on the matter.

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.140
But I didn't feel she really understood my situation.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.140
Although I appreciated her concern, I felt like she was judging me.

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.159
The next day, I decided to visit Charlotte and Ellen and ask their advice.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.140
Like me, Charlotte had come into the truth many years before Ellen.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.140
So they really understood my situation.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.140
Is Amy right?

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.140
Would it be wrong to attend the wedding?

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.139
What would you do if you were moon?

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:13.139
Charlotte explained that in situations with is no specific Bible command,

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:16.139
it becomes a matter of conscience.

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:21.139
And what one person's conscience allows may be different from another.

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:28.780
The important thing is that we make decisions that leave us with a good conscience.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:44.969
But how do I do that?

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:48.969
Dear Emma, it's really a matter of training.

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:53.969
Ellen showed me the scripture in Hebrews 5 is 14 where the Apostle Paul wrote,

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:56.969
solid food belongs to mature people.

00:02:56.969 --> 00:03:03.969
To those who through use have the powers of discernment trained to distinguish both right and wrong.

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:11.009
But Paul didn't just write those words.

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:13.009
He lived them.

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:19.569
He carefully studied the principles in God's Word.

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:26.569
And as a result, you was able to make decisions that left him with a good conscience.

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:39.219
So even when there's no stated law on a matter, we can always find a Bible principle that can give us insight into God's thinking.

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.639
So I made it a matter of prayer and then I got to work.

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:57.270
I researched articles in the Watchtower Publications Index and Research Guide.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:08.030
I found a really good thought in chapter 2 of the God's love book.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:14.030
I also read about others who faced similar situations and what Bible principles they found helpful.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:26.420
Then I meditated on all these.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:45.240
As I kept studying, I was able to bring my conscience in harmony with Jehovah's spirit, not just with my heart.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:53.240
I realized that having a Bible-trained conscience doesn't mean everyone will always think exactly alike.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.240
And that's okay.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:04.240
But if we train our conscience by applying Bible principles, it will guide us along in life so that each of us can remain in God's love.
