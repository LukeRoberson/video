WEBVTT

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:03.549
Well now we have something exciting

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:09.710
We're pleased to feature a new part on our Giliad program this year

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.710
Now they've made me promise not to say another word

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.629
So let's enjoy this new feature together

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.179
Thanks for coming follow me. I need to talk to Ken about something really important come on

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:35.369
Ken, I have some interesting news. I need to share with you. It's exciting. I can tell by the look on your face

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:40.649
Something's up. It is. It's about the great graduation program. Oh, no, not a change. Yeah a change

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.689
But it's so intricate it's positive

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:46.450
You know the student experiences part that we've had for many years

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.490
They share their field service experiences and I do too

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:56.570
But the teaching committee wants to broaden it out look Ken the students are from all over the world coming from various branches

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.170
They have experiences they can share perhaps from their own branch or maybe something about the kingdom work

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.769
That has taken place in that country. It's going to be exciting different interesting. I like it

00:01:08.769 --> 00:01:14.469
But I'm wondering yeah, but I'm wondering you know everybody's used to that experience is format

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:20.450
What I know what's the format of this new segment going to love it a talk show a talk show a talk show

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.170
It means though you're gonna have to build a set you're gonna have to have lighting

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.849
What about if they can sing or there's musical instruments that they can play we'll need a little spot for them to actually

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:37.049
Perform a song. I'm thinking though if it's gonna be a show. Mm-hmm. It's got to have a nice you make it unique. Okay

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:40.890
The inside story can

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:48.930
Because you're getting it resonates you're getting inside the inside story. Let's go with that. Okay, but Mark

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.170
We are weeks away from Gilead graduate. I know we'll have to work hard to pull this off. Do you think we can get this down in time?

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.450
Let's see

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:28.490
Friends you are in for a real treat

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.490
I'm here with the whole class of Gilead and they've gotten together to get better acquainted with some of their classmates and

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.810
We have been invited to this occasion

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:45.770
You are going to meet some lovable brothers and sisters and you're going to hear some exciting faith strengthening experiences

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.030
You're going to also hear some delightful music because some in this class have musical talent

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.030
So come with me and we're going to get the inside story

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:07.879
Our first guest is sister Evelyn Huber who is a single sister in this class and she's serving in Paraguay

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:16.729
Evelyn, thank you so much. You were living in a neighborhood like this in

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:20.069
Munich a culturally rich city

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.870
You lived in an apartment

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.069
Like this very sleek modern nice

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.110
You had a good paying job and you were pioneering

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:35.550
How did you end up clear around the world in Paraguay?

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.590
That was actually quite a change for me

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:44.669
So there was this German Kingdom Ministry back then in 2005 that mentioned

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:52.310
Large German-speaking community in Paraguay and a great need for German-speaking publishers

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:57.469
They're in South America and that call that announcement really touched my heart

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:00.030
I wanted to go there. I wanted to serve there

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:05.669
So I wrote my letter to the branch they invited me over and a few months later

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:12.189
I arrived in Paraguay and they sent me together with seven others to Santa Rosa de la Guadalu and

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:15.789
There we started a German activity from zero

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.790
Now when you got there though you got a little bit of a surprise so we arrived in the first colony

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:29.389
And I talked to a man and after my nice introduction he just looked at me was big eyes and he said

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.750
I couldn't even for stone. So sorry. I can't understand you

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.589
And I looked at him and I said I can't understand you either

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:46.470
That was the moment when I realized these people the men on nights they don't speak our German

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.149
They have their own language. They're so called low German. How do you learn low German?

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.389
They don't exist any books

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:59.790
For learning the language low German and we didn't have internet at that time in our area in Paraguay

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.470
So we really didn't know how to learn the language

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:10.149
We pray to Jehovah and we said Jehovah we really want to preach to these people and the 80-year-old man onite man

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.230
Was the answer to our prayer

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:15.029
That's him that's Willie

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:22.189
He really wanted to study the Bible so we taught him the Bible and he taught us the language low German

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:27.509
And he was an excellent Bible student and also a fantastic language teacher

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:31.750
Well, isn't that amazing now I do understand though that you

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.069
You learned a trick that helped you to be better understood by those low German speakers

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:42.389
We found out when we spoke our German like Americans with an American accent

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:48.990
No, with with an American accent. What do you mean by that? I give you an example good morning in German

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.269
We would say good morning and Americans would say good turn more against there

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:59.550
Please talk to us like that. This is so much better to understand you

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:07.990
So for quite a while we kept on going like that. So the American accent really helped you

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.990
Okay

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:15.790
Finally you came to a realization that you were beginning to get fluid in the language. How did that happen?

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.790
We went out again in ministry and

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:25.230
very furious lady man onite lady came out of her house and while she was yelling at us

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:30.149
I realized wow, I understand everything the word that she's saying to me

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.670
So I looked at my pioneer partner Tanya. She looked so happy too and

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.790
And the lady thought we couldn't understand her because you're smiling at her

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:43.509
So she repeated the whole thing again, and that was our confirmation

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:48.110
Wow, we really understood her and we really understood low German

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:54.310
So with a big smile and very happy we left her farm. I see. I'm sure she was really confused

00:06:55.709 --> 00:07:03.310
Evelyn could you just kind of explain to us? What are some of the challenges you face as a single sister in your territory there in Paraguay?

00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:06.029
Let's go to Paraguay

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:09.670
Would you join me traveling to a man onite colony?

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:11.949
Let's go

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:38.560
The trip takes us approximately three hours

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:42.480
Now we enter the real Paraguayan roads

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:50.040
Bright red sand sometimes dry and dusty and sometimes just muddy and dirty

00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:00.439
There we are, traveling, having time to enjoy Chihau's wonderful creation and to think about the people we are going to visit today

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:13.579
Do you know what we especially love when we enter a colony and the following happens?

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:19.980
Children come running out of their homes asking for new Caleb and Sophia videos

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:26.620
Kids just love the videos and we are so happy to have them now also in low German

00:08:28.829 --> 00:08:32.110
Ah now you see what man onite homes look like

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:36.110
They have nice houses lovely gardens

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:38.830
They all have their own farm

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:45.289
It's really a pleasure when you get to study with the man onites

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:53.340
It's so encouraging when one of your studies progresses enough to come to the meetings

00:08:56.169 --> 00:08:58.330
It takes great courage for them

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:05.149
And you really have to meet my congregation

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:10.830
Santa Rosa, low German, full of Salis pioneers and publishers

00:09:11.309 --> 00:09:20.919
Ah look at them

00:09:20.919 --> 00:09:25.320
Here I might be love brothers and sisters so good to see them all again

00:09:26.039 --> 00:09:32.840
They all send us their love

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.039
That was a very touching video it seems like such an exciting life

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.399
I realized how much Chihauva can do with single sisters how he uses them

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:46.440
And in my congregation there are actually more than 50% single sisters

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:55.580
The long heritage actually for sisters going to Gilia serving in foreign assignments

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:59.019
Chihauva really loves single sisters they are precious for him

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.019
Well that's certainly the truth

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:05.179
And we are very proud of you and all the single sisters

00:10:05.419 --> 00:10:11.100
And very appreciative of the huge contribution that you've made to the worldwide work

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:15.500
And the kingdom efforts it's it's amazing and we know Chihauva loves you

00:10:15.899 --> 00:10:18.460
It's been such a pleasure getting to know you Evelyn

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:21.100
Thank you so much for sharing your experiences with us

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.139
That was my pleasure

00:10:22.139 --> 00:10:22.620
Thank you

00:10:26.269 --> 00:10:28.029
Now Evelyn I have one more question for you

00:10:28.509 --> 00:10:32.350
Were you surprised to find out that there was so much musical talent in your class?

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:34.029
Oh I definitely was

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:37.950
Well now it's time to get a sample of that musical talent

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:39.549
We have a band

00:10:39.549 --> 00:10:43.389
They're going to perform an original song composed by one of your classmates

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:47.950
And the song is entitled Pronto Serra Realidad

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:50.750
In English that means soon it will be a reality

00:10:51.309 --> 00:10:53.870
Let's listen to Pronto Serra Realidad

00:14:10.919 --> 00:14:13.720
That was a great song very touching

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.120
Our next guest is actually one of the band members

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.039
Let's welcome brother Joel Hurley

00:14:27.519 --> 00:14:30.879
So Joel you're serving at the branch in Australia now

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:36.559
But you have a rich heritage in the truth that given to you by your grandparents

00:14:36.559 --> 00:14:39.440
Parents could you just explain a little bit about that to us

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.519
My grandfather actually learnt the truth from a fellow band member

00:14:43.519 --> 00:14:46.080
He was so impressed with the use of God's name

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.000
And that God's name was Chihauva

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.360
That he made sure that he taught the truth to many family members

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.600
But sometime later in 1960

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:58.480
They decided as a family to move to serve with a need was greater

00:14:58.559 --> 00:15:00.720
So they moved to the Pacific Islands in Fiji

00:15:01.759 --> 00:15:03.519
So my dad grew up in Fiji

00:15:03.519 --> 00:15:05.039
I see, I think we have a picture yeah

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.240
This is my dad next to the car

00:15:08.799 --> 00:15:12.240
They're witnessing to the village chief and his family

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.759
So memories of them growing up in Fiji

00:15:15.759 --> 00:15:16.960
Later on he married my mum

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.360
They continued to serve there for some time

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.919
They really did have a big impact on my early years

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.559
Preaching in the villages

00:15:24.559 --> 00:15:27.440
Organising special conventions events

00:15:27.519 --> 00:15:29.679
Such as the around the world convention

00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:31.519
So we see brother friends

00:15:31.519 --> 00:15:35.919
So now as a young person then you decided to learn Japanese

00:15:35.919 --> 00:15:36.720
Why did you do that?

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:43.679
In the early 80s there was a Japanese group attached to the Kingdom Hall where we attended

00:15:43.679 --> 00:15:45.840
So there was a need at the time in that group

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.879
In fact many from Japan came to help out

00:15:48.879 --> 00:15:51.039
They encouraged me to learn Japanese

00:15:51.039 --> 00:15:52.879
So I began to learn the language

00:15:52.879 --> 00:15:55.279
So you've been speaking Japanese now for a how long?

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.519
30 odd years, my goodness

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:02.240
Now you went to MTS and after MTS graduation

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.799
Tell us about some of your assignments

00:16:04.799 --> 00:16:07.120
For the first assignment was with the Japanese group

00:16:07.919 --> 00:16:11.279
And shortly after it became a congregation

00:16:11.279 --> 00:16:14.240
A whole range of different backgrounds came into the truth

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.320
CEOs in Japanese companies

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:19.200
Young ones for the first time who learnt the truth

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:24.000
Even a Buddhist monk learnt the truth and became a zealous pioneer in the congregation

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.120
What was your next assignment?

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:28.720
Was the other side of the country, to Western Australia, to a country assignment

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.720
Western Australia, now is that the outback?

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.000
We've all heard about the outback

00:16:32.879 --> 00:16:35.279
Well parts of it are called the golden outback

00:16:35.279 --> 00:16:37.279
But there's a lot of bushland

00:16:37.279 --> 00:16:39.279
There's a large farming community

00:16:39.279 --> 00:16:40.960
Wait, she have a picture here

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.080
Some of the things

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:46.080
In fact there's a variety of people we were able to speak to in that territory

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.000
You say a variety of people

00:16:49.919 --> 00:16:53.120
I don't see too many people in that picture

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.799
Where did this variety come from?

00:16:54.799 --> 00:16:56.240
Well there were townships

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.759
There were the farmers

00:16:57.759 --> 00:17:00.159
There were bushes, ones who live off the land

00:17:00.159 --> 00:17:02.000
Australia and Aborigines

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.360
And tourists

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.400
Tourists

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.960
So we're out there in rural Australia

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.160
There are tourists

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.279
What is there to see?

00:17:09.279 --> 00:17:12.240
Well they'd come to visit the famous icons in the area

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.440
For example Waverock

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:18.079
This is a natural rock formation in the shape of a breaking wave

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.880
In fact one time there was this Japanese man

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.799
He'd cycled across Australia

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:25.279
And he was capping not far from the rock

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:28.240
I was able to speak and use my Japanese

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.440
He was interested

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:33.440
The next day he traveled 100 or so kilometers to where I was living

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.720
Followed up the interest

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.920
And then was able to pass it on to Japan for further follow up

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:41.440
Were there a congregation out there in the rural area?

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.440
It was a small family like congregation

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.720
We stuck together

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.839
I see, so how far were they have to drive sometimes?

00:17:47.839 --> 00:17:50.559
Over 100 kilometers in many instances

00:17:50.559 --> 00:17:52.160
On gravel roads

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.799
Roads whereby a mob of kangaroos

00:17:54.799 --> 00:17:56.000
Could actually come out

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.119
So quite changed

00:17:57.119 --> 00:17:58.640
Sorry, one second

00:17:58.640 --> 00:17:59.839
A mob of kangaroos?

00:17:59.839 --> 00:18:00.799
What's that?

00:18:00.799 --> 00:18:01.839
I was wondering the same thing

00:18:01.839 --> 00:18:03.440
What do you mean a mob?

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.559
For example

00:18:04.559 --> 00:18:08.079
Coming home from a Bible study on dusk one night on a dirt road

00:18:08.079 --> 00:18:10.319
Suddenly I find this mob of kangaroos

00:18:10.319 --> 00:18:12.400
10, 15 kangaroos around the car

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.359
So just have to be careful in those areas

00:18:15.359 --> 00:18:17.839
To make sure we take caution at all times

00:18:17.839 --> 00:18:18.880
That's quite a picture

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:21.920
You know, middle picture all these kangaroos bouncing around the car

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.359
After that rural assignment

00:18:23.359 --> 00:18:25.519
You had some assignments to some bigger cities

00:18:26.319 --> 00:18:28.160
And then you did some substitute circuit work

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:31.119
And then you were reassigned to Bethel

00:18:31.119 --> 00:18:34.240
So at Bethel you're back in the Japanese congregation

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.200
So Joel, tell us

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.720
What is it like being at Bethel serving in a Japanese congregation

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.319
But would you like to have a look at a video

00:18:42.319 --> 00:18:44.240
Which explains what our territories like?

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:50.890
Of course we would

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:53.769
We only have one Japanese language congregation in Sydney

00:18:53.849 --> 00:18:55.369
So our territories are vast

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:59.049
We typically spend long days in the ministry

00:18:59.849 --> 00:19:01.930
Some of us will leave early in the morning

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:05.289
To catch the ferry and go to a popular tourist place

00:19:05.289 --> 00:19:06.329
Called Circular Key

00:19:07.769 --> 00:19:09.529
There's many Japanese tourists here

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:12.329
We'll often find a group of Japanese tourists

00:19:12.329 --> 00:19:13.609
Setting up to take a photo

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:16.250
And we might approach them and say

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:17.849
Shushin or Torimashoka

00:19:17.849 --> 00:19:19.130
Can I take a photo for you?

00:19:19.849 --> 00:19:21.690
A good conversation then begins

00:19:24.619 --> 00:19:27.900
The many young Japanese pioneers still in school

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.059
May join up with us later in the afternoon

00:19:32.279 --> 00:19:36.039
The interested person may hear the message for the first time

00:19:36.039 --> 00:19:37.640
And attend the meeting that night

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:47.769
We often enjoy refreshing association with each other in the congregation

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:50.490
Particularly after a long day in the ministry

00:19:51.289 --> 00:19:54.970
Recently we just had our first pioneer school in Japanese

00:19:56.170 --> 00:20:00.170
They were so grateful they didn't have to travel back to Japan to attend the school

00:20:02.779 --> 00:20:06.220
There's really no separation between ministry and life

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:08.619
It is life

00:20:09.819 --> 00:20:11.019
The best life

00:20:11.019 --> 00:20:19.119
Thank you for sharing that video

00:20:19.599 --> 00:20:21.759
It seems like you have a very nice assignment there

00:20:23.119 --> 00:20:25.039
Now looking back over your life, Joel

00:20:25.039 --> 00:20:28.640
Would you have chosen now looking back to do anything else

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.160
At times they have been challenges

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.799
Whether that be loneliness or isolation

00:20:35.359 --> 00:20:37.599
Because of language or the environment

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:42.079
But it's really given me an opportunity to rely on Jehovah God at that time

00:20:42.079 --> 00:20:43.039
To learn endurance

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:47.119
He's provided family, friends, wherever I've gone

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.400
And to be able to sense Jehovah's pleasure

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:54.079
And Jehovah's support at these times is something that I'm really grateful for

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:58.160
Joel this has been very pleasurable talking to you

00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.119
And very encouraging

00:20:59.119 --> 00:21:01.039
Thank you for sharing your experiences with us

00:21:05.069 --> 00:21:07.069
Now Joel is time for you to go back to the piano

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.039
Our band is going to play another song for us

00:21:12.519 --> 00:21:15.720
And like the first one, this is an original composition

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.319
Written by one of your classmates

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:21.799
This song is entitled The Promised Land

00:21:22.599 --> 00:21:23.240
Let's listen

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.400
What a beautiful song

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.480
What wonderful sentiments are expressed there

00:24:39.839 --> 00:24:41.279
Well we've been to Paraguay

00:24:41.519 --> 00:24:42.720
We've been to Australia

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.039
Now it's time to go to Russia

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.400
Our final guest is Brother Moses Ejiboya

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.599
Who's serving in the Russia brand

00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:02.410
Back in 1988, you were a man in your late teens

00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:04.170
Pioneering in Britain

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:06.970
But somehow you ended up in Soviet Russia

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:09.369
Pioneering in a country under band

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:11.849
How did that happen Moses?

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:14.890
In my pioneer partner and myself

00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:18.250
We were out in the ministry and met a man

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:20.970
Who happened to be a diplomat from Russia

00:25:21.609 --> 00:25:26.569
And he was interested and we would go back to him and make return visits regularly

00:25:27.289 --> 00:25:30.650
And after a few weeks he told us that

00:25:31.369 --> 00:25:33.289
We want to go to Moscow

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:38.650
He offered us actually a free language scholarship for three months

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:40.569
That was back in 1988

00:25:40.809 --> 00:25:42.170
What happened in the meantime?

00:25:42.569 --> 00:25:45.450
Following the three months during the language course

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:48.650
The professor, one of the professors who was teaching the language

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:53.690
helped to upgrade my language scholarship into a medical scholarship

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:54.730
A medical scholarship?

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:55.930
Like a medical student

00:25:56.009 --> 00:25:59.450
My goodness, so now you're going to medical school

00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:01.769
And you're pioneering

00:26:01.769 --> 00:26:02.970
That's right, absolutely

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:13.960
But even so, you really didn't plan to finish the medical degree

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.160
But what happened?

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.799
I thought that the band will be lifted pretty soon

00:26:17.799 --> 00:26:21.400
And I will be serving as a pioneer

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:24.680
Where in the territory where the need is great

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:28.599
But you see, the lifted of the band took several years

00:26:28.599 --> 00:26:30.359
And so you kept going to medical school?

00:26:30.359 --> 00:26:30.839
That's right

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:35.000
1991, March 27th, could you just explain to us about that?

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.920
The band was lifted, we are registered

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.920
It means that we have freedom of religion

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:41.880
So we cannot stay in those private homes anymore

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:42.759
I think we have a picture, yeah

00:26:42.759 --> 00:26:45.640
And so yeah, this is the first place we actually got

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.880
It was a movie theater

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.400
And one part of Moscow

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:55.400
We rented and read the first letter that we got from the organization

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.240
About the lifting of the band

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.599
The brother who read it

00:26:58.599 --> 00:27:01.559
It took him about 20 minutes to read

00:27:02.839 --> 00:27:04.519
One and a half pages later

00:27:04.519 --> 00:27:05.720
Why did it take so long?

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:07.880
Well, you can imagine

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:10.039
Many years, they were on the band

00:27:10.039 --> 00:27:11.160
And now the band is lifted

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.359
The friends cannot believe

00:27:12.359 --> 00:27:13.640
Even the brother himself

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.400
There was a lot of crying

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.839
And cries of joy

00:27:16.839 --> 00:27:18.680
And it's touching moment

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:19.559
I never forget that

00:27:20.359 --> 00:27:22.839
How did you care for all the new ones coming in?

00:27:22.839 --> 00:27:27.400
By 1992, we already have four large congregations in Moscow

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.160
When you say large, how many we talking?

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:31.240
Well up to 800 publishers

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.960
And each of them, if we had enough elders

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:37.559
Those congregations would have split into three, four or even five

00:27:37.559 --> 00:27:39.960
We used to have, for example, book studies

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:42.680
You only had a few elders, how did you have enough book study conductors

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:46.039
We figured out that any male member of the congregation

00:27:46.039 --> 00:27:47.559
Who get baptized

00:27:47.559 --> 00:27:49.559
Will get a book study

00:27:49.559 --> 00:27:51.559
They were happy, they made themselves available

00:27:51.559 --> 00:27:52.920
They were very zealous

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.759
But some of the material we discussed

00:27:54.759 --> 00:27:55.880
To the book study was pretty deep

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:57.799
How did they manage to teach it correctly?

00:27:57.799 --> 00:27:59.799
We would put all these newly baptized

00:27:59.799 --> 00:28:03.880
The brothers who have book study together on the Sunday evening

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:06.839
And have three to four hours sections with them

00:28:06.839 --> 00:28:10.039
Yes, they had a brother, some of them

00:28:10.039 --> 00:28:11.960
These brothers are newly baptized

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:13.400
Book study conductors

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:16.519
And this was just one of the groups, there were several groups like this

00:28:16.519 --> 00:28:17.160
Many

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.200
My goodness

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:22.839
How did you manage even on the weekend to have enough speakers for public talks and things?

00:28:22.839 --> 00:28:23.640
Absolutely

00:28:24.599 --> 00:28:28.200
In Moscow, at that time there were only a few elders

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:30.359
So we were all grouped together

00:28:30.359 --> 00:28:33.240
Basically into one body of elders

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:38.440
And each one of us were on a rotating list of giving public talks

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:40.440
So some brothers on the weekends

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:43.000
Saturday and Sundays we had many meetings

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.400
They would go and give two or three talks

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:48.440
Myself, because I was single

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:51.799
Very often gave four to five talks every weekend

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:55.240
Oh my goodness, amazing

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:59.480
Now, let's take a look at this next picture we have here

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.400
So here we see Brother Jeris

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.759
This is shortly after the ban

00:29:02.759 --> 00:29:05.640
And can you tell us one of the things he's explaining to you here?

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:08.599
We were all in the audience and he told us of the importance

00:29:08.599 --> 00:29:11.240
To go through the baptismal questions

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:15.000
With each individually

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.680
And then we sat in the audience

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:19.480
Most of us said, oh, how on earth are we going to do that?

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.720
Because before that, you know, Brother Stomo

00:29:21.799 --> 00:29:24.920
Where we put 30, 40 people together

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:26.680
And just go through the questions with them

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:29.000
Because the influx was so big

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.799
We basically cannot handle them individually

00:29:31.799 --> 00:29:35.079
But Brother Jeris proved the point by telling us that

00:29:35.079 --> 00:29:37.720
The organization to accomplish a ministry book

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.319
Is for that purpose

00:29:39.319 --> 00:29:43.400
Because we want a spiritually strong organization

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.559
Not just the statistics

00:29:45.559 --> 00:29:46.680
We obeyed

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.839
But it was not easy in the beginning

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.519
So, how did you do it?

00:29:50.519 --> 00:29:54.519
I mean, how long did it take to go through these questions with these baptismal candidates?

00:29:54.519 --> 00:29:57.240
Well, it took many hours for many others to do that

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.720
Myself because I was single

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.880
And young back then, I remember occasions

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:06.119
Where you will sit at 8 a.m. with the first candidate

00:30:06.119 --> 00:30:09.880
Baptismal candidate and end up only at 12 midnight

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:11.240
They will take their turns

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:12.519
After work, they will come

00:30:12.519 --> 00:30:14.680
They will not want to miss their turn

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.880
That was how zealous the harvest was

00:30:18.839 --> 00:30:20.119
So, let me get this straight

00:30:20.119 --> 00:30:22.039
So, you're pioneering

00:30:22.039 --> 00:30:23.720
You're going to medical school

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:26.440
You're giving five talks on the weekend

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:30.519
You're spending three hours in sessions with book study conductors

00:30:30.519 --> 00:30:33.880
You're spending from 8 to midnight with baptismal candidates

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:35.160
How did you do it?

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:37.799
Holy Spirit

00:30:37.799 --> 00:30:38.759
And we went young

00:30:38.759 --> 00:30:40.839
When we went young, we think we can move mountains

00:30:40.839 --> 00:30:44.519
But the Holy Spirit was actually obvious

00:30:44.519 --> 00:30:46.759
The branch then has asked you to come

00:30:46.759 --> 00:30:50.759
Or ask you to come to the branch from the field

00:30:50.759 --> 00:30:54.279
And probably you were happy because that would have been relief

00:30:54.279 --> 00:30:56.440
I mean, from this schedule

00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:00.440
You know, to be honest, Burstova, it was the opposite

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:02.359
It was the harvest time

00:31:02.359 --> 00:31:07.480
And you know, to experience the joy of what Jesus said about the harvest

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.920
That the harvest is great

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:12.039
And the workers are joyous

00:31:12.039 --> 00:31:13.559
Many things were happening

00:31:13.559 --> 00:31:14.599
People were coming in

00:31:14.599 --> 00:31:17.799
We were studying the Bible with hundreds of people

00:31:17.799 --> 00:31:23.400
You say you've actually been involved with helping hundreds of people into the church?

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:26.759
Directly or indirectly sitting and studying the Bible

00:31:26.759 --> 00:31:29.480
And so, I didn't hurry to go down there

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:33.000
Conventions were going on all these meetings

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000
But, they tracked you down

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.599
Oh yes, they did

00:31:36.599 --> 00:31:40.440
And I was obedient when they tracked me down

00:31:40.519 --> 00:31:44.039
And later on, I apologize for my behavior

00:31:44.039 --> 00:31:48.440
So, what did you do when you went to the branch?

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:53.160
The branch actually wanted me to set up the hospital information desk work

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:58.279
Amazing, so that medical training really has been very valuable

00:31:58.279 --> 00:32:04.519
So, what is it like then, working with HID in Russia?

00:32:04.519 --> 00:32:07.240
How about if we look at the video, it would be easier

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:09.960
To just give you a chest of what happens

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:12.599
And how is that work is going on in Russia?

00:32:12.599 --> 00:32:15.980
That would be great

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:20.700
One of our sisters was told she needed a blood transfusion

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:23.579
But the doctor said, they should forget about the religion

00:32:23.579 --> 00:32:26.859
Because I am like God to them

00:32:26.859 --> 00:32:34.000
Incidentally, I cut a cockroach crawling on the floor of his office

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.160
Then I smashed the cockroach

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:39.839
And I told him, that cockroach is dead

00:32:39.839 --> 00:32:47.359
Now, if you can bring it back to life, then I believe you are a God

00:32:47.359 --> 00:32:50.880
Well, he could say nothing at all

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:57.440
Righteous indignation gave me the courage to go and plead our case with the director of the hospital

00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:02.079
There's no doubt Jehovah really was helping us

00:33:02.079 --> 00:33:08.240
That director became one of our strongest advocates and bloodless surgeries

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:14.480
Later, he would even speak on our behalf to many doctors and conferences

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.960
Look at this beautiful little girl

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:20.079
She was born with a blood condition

00:33:20.079 --> 00:33:24.400
It was a real fight not to give her blood

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:30.079
Her case went all the way to the European court and we won the case

00:33:30.079 --> 00:33:34.079
There she is now, healthy and happy

00:33:34.079 --> 00:33:43.950
Experiences like these in the HLC work have really touched my heart

00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:50.839
Moses, thank you so much for those very encouraging experiences

00:33:50.839 --> 00:33:54.920
It wasn't just an amazingly enjoyable occasion

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:58.920
It's been so thrilling, so faith-strengthening to

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:01.559
Get to know these brothers and sisters who have worked so hard

00:34:01.559 --> 00:34:04.920
Who Jehovah has blessed to such a degree

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:08.360
Really, we wish and hope that Jehovah blesses you

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10.840
As you continue to work hard in his service

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:33.480
Until the next time we get together to get the inside story

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:46.780
Well, what did you think of the new feature?

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:49.019
I'm sure we'll be seeing more of that in the future

00:34:49.019 --> 00:34:50.860
We can certainly hope

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:53.260
Well now it's time for you to participate again

00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:54.940
If you can, would you please stand?

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:57.659
We'll sing song number 110

00:34:57.659 --> 00:35:00.380
Which is entitled The Joy of Jehovah

00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:01.900
Song 110
