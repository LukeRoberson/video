WEBVTT

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:10.529
I'm booing when you step out of town

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:13.490
So, you gonna talk to any group of people?

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.330
I don't think so.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.530
Look, I know you got a part-time job lined up

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.250
and you're gonna find your...

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.690
Yeah, so...

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.809
So, the video production people are here.

00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:26.769
I'm sure they have part-time.

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.050
Yeah, I still don't know.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.329
Look, Dennis, you're good at it.

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.969
Besides, they do corporate videos.

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.090
Nothing bad.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.409
Come on, just talk to them.

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:49.859
All right, I'll check it out.

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:51.460
I hear you.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.780
Eventually, you want to work part-time

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.899
to pursue other passions.

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.380
Well, I'd like to start part-time.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.420
It's doable.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.700
But after you're established,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.739
after a few years of hard work and dedication,

00:01:05.739 --> 00:01:07.299
you'll be able to pick your own jobs

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:11.019
and you'll even get to set your own schedule.

00:01:11.019 --> 00:01:12.900
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.379
Hey, thanks so much for your time.

00:01:15.379 --> 00:01:18.540
One second, before you leave.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:26.010
Just so you know, here's what you can make in your first year.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.409
My advice?

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.170
Try not to get too caught up in the sacrifice.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.829
Think about the payback.

00:01:33.829 --> 00:02:12.759
Thanks.

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:15.680
Money.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.479
No.

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:21.389
Wealth.

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:26.020
Proverbs 23, 4 and 5.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.580
Do not wear yourself out to gain wealth.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.289
Stop and show understanding.

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:39.020
When you cast your eyes on it, it is not there.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.819
For it will surely sprout wings that can eagle

00:02:42.819 --> 00:03:00.199
and fly off into the sky.

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:02.400
Hey, you ready to go?

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.080
Yeah, ready.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.919
So you talk to anybody?

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:10.120
Yeah.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.159
Learned anything good?

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:13.280
I did.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.819
We'll tell you.

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.740
Do not set your mind on lofty things,

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.219
but be let along with the lowly things.

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:30.919
Romans 12, 16.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.520
Oh, Lena, do you still have your study

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.280
before the Chinese meeting?

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.199
Yeah, thank you for picking me up after work.

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:37.280
OK, have fun.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.879
Bye, honey.

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:38.879
Enjoy your study.

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:39.280
Thanks.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.639
Love you.

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:54.500
Bye.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.099
Good morning, Lena.

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:57.060
Oh, good morning.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.979
So sales team dropped the ball and didn't tell us

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:01.379
that the clients this morning speak Chinese.

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:04.539
You can do this, right?

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:05.620
Yeah, sure.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.460
Perfect.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.979
Thanks.

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:10.129
See you soon.

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:11.969
Thank you, you guys.

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:22.600
I hope you guys will like my cooking.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.240
Now.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.199
Nice job, Lena.

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:26.199
Well done.

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:27.199
OK.

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:36.899
You wanted to see me?

00:04:36.899 --> 00:04:38.819
Lena, come on in.

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:41.139
Thanks.

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:42.500
Great job this morning.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.019
Thank you.

00:04:43.019 --> 00:04:44.459
Yeah, really well done.

00:04:44.459 --> 00:04:46.180
And what we saw in there confirmed something

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.860
that we've been thinking about for a while.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.019
About what?

00:04:50.019 --> 00:04:53.180
A TV network wants to do a new reality series.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.019
That's right.

00:04:54.019 --> 00:04:57.100
In each episode, we do a project for a customer.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.139
You want to cast from among our designers and builders,

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.180
and they need a young person to host.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.699
Hello?

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:05.180
Lena, you are a top pick.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.019
Listen, this can change your life.

00:05:07.019 --> 00:05:09.259
We want you to think it over, but we need to know soon.

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:10.180
Sorry, Lena.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:23.480
Vanessa, where are we at with me?

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.839
Generation of design.

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:34.660
We're mirroring tonight at 8.30 Central.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.420
Generation of design.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:41.439
All new season, tonight at 8.30 Central.

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:43.800
Sorry, it didn't work out, Lena.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.439
We had to go with a new host this year.

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:51.160
Do not set your mind on lofty things,

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.560
but be led along with the lonely things.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.360
I could sacrifice all these spiritual things,

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.839
and I still might not make it in the business world.

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:07.240
But even if it did work out, I'd be worse off.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.040
Either way, I don't want to give up spiritual things.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.560
OK, where were we?

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.680
Lena, this sounds big, right?

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.240
It does.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.560
And I know this seems quick, but my mind's

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.319
already set on some big things.

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:34.800
So thank you so much, but I just can't do both.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.560
Hey, hey, you ready to go?

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.959
Yeah, but where's your car?

00:06:40.959 --> 00:06:41.879
Are you serious?

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:43.879
Your car's busted again.

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:45.720
You need a new car, man.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:46.680
Can your parents drive us?

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.199
Or?

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:48.839
Well, they want to study right now.

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:50.439
We can walk, they'll meet us there.

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:51.800
The bakery's just down the street.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.279
We'll pick something up for the radencoes.

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:58.170
All right.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.170
Hey, you want some coffee?

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.930
Yeah, sure.

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:01.930
OK.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:10.839
Then I'm going to have two coffees and a box of targets.

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:11.800
Thanks so much.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.399
You're welcome.

00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:15.560
Your coffees will be ready in a car.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.699
You're just waiting on our drinks.

00:07:18.699 --> 00:07:20.019
Hey, what are you so into?

00:07:20.019 --> 00:07:22.459
Bro, they just released the entire season

00:07:22.459 --> 00:07:26.220
to Let's Binge Watch This Weekend.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.579
Yeah, I don't watch that show anymore.

00:07:28.579 --> 00:07:30.019
It started getting weird.

00:07:30.019 --> 00:07:31.939
All the heroes lived together in that house

00:07:31.939 --> 00:07:33.620
and date each other.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.980
Right, but it's both the action scenes.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:41.029
It's not like it shows them having sex.

00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.790
Order's up.

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:42.870
Your coffees are ready.

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:53.560
I'll get it.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:54.160
Here you go.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.720
Thanks, man.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.439
Hey, Jake, I bought the show.

00:07:58.439 --> 00:08:00.560
Here's a scripture that helped me out.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.810
Romans 12 verse 2.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:04.769
Right.

00:08:04.769 --> 00:08:07.649
That one says stopping molded by the system of things.

00:08:07.649 --> 00:08:10.730
But you know I wouldn't do those things.

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:11.649
Yeah.

00:08:11.649 --> 00:08:16.850
But it also says, be transformed by making your mind over.

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:20.889
I honestly felt that that show was making my mind over

00:08:20.889 --> 00:08:23.449
in the wrong direction.

00:08:23.449 --> 00:08:26.490
OK, but it still do it, right?

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:27.850
Sure.

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:32.210
But let's say, for example, you're interested in someone.

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:34.490
Let's say Vicki.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:35.730
Maybe.

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:42.019
Well, imagine the two of you start dating.

00:08:42.019 --> 00:08:46.549
You'd find good ways to get to know each other

00:08:46.549 --> 00:08:51.399
and see each other in different situations.

00:08:51.399 --> 00:08:56.350
But if your mind isn't fully made over to Jehovah's way,

00:08:56.350 --> 00:09:07.379
how far might you go?

00:09:07.379 --> 00:09:09.379
OK, a seer point.

00:09:09.379 --> 00:09:14.139
But I'm still not convinced it tripped me out.

00:09:14.139 --> 00:09:49.580
Yeah, but it's worth thinking about.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.340
I saw you looking at Dennis.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.659
Please, you and Jake were inseparable.

00:09:53.659 --> 00:09:57.659
He is cute and doing pretty good spiritually.

00:09:57.659 --> 00:09:59.700
Pretty good or really good?

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:00.740
Let's just say good.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.460
Besides, it's not like we're dating.

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:04.100
It's just observing.

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.899
That's good to hear, girls.

00:10:05.899 --> 00:10:09.019
You're both still young.

00:10:09.019 --> 00:10:11.899
But you can't help notice.

00:10:11.899 --> 00:10:16.820
It's spirituality or the looks.

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:20.539
Hey, Mom, what was the first thing that you noticed about Dad?

00:10:20.539 --> 00:10:22.019
Oh, well.

00:10:22.019 --> 00:10:25.179
Oh, I wasn't the first one she noticed.

00:10:25.179 --> 00:10:29.350
Oh, you have to tell us.

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:31.509
OK.

00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:34.230
His name was Tony.

00:10:34.230 --> 00:11:00.120
And it was definitely looks first.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:04.399
But then her parents said, you need to look deeper.

00:11:04.399 --> 00:11:05.960
Yeah.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:10.399
They definitely gave me a lot to think about.

00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:15.879
The verse at Proverbs 31 and 30 had a big impact on me.

00:11:15.879 --> 00:11:20.559
It says, charm may be false and beauty may be fleeting.

00:11:20.559 --> 00:11:25.720
But the woman who fears Jehovah will be praised.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:29.240
When I thought about that verse, I realized it applied to me,

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.720
but it also applied to Tony.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:36.159
Neither of us was looking for the person who fears Jehovah.

00:11:36.159 --> 00:11:38.600
I tried to think what my life would be like,

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:51.840
married to somebody who didn't put spiritual things first.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:12:03.120
And I really didn't like what I saw.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:07.120
So I decided that it was best to end things with Tony.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.279
And I started pioneering.

00:12:09.279 --> 00:12:14.200
And a year later, at Pioneer School, I noticed someone else.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.120
You were hard to miss, too.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.360
Thanks.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.759
Still, it took time.

00:12:19.759 --> 00:12:20.360
It did.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:25.840
It really took until we could see ourselves putting Jehovah first,

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.559
but together.

00:12:27.559 --> 00:12:33.960
This is a choice that could either bring laughter or sorrow.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.960
And the feelings that start in it with the heart,

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.399
they could be gone tomorrow.
