00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:19.570
The one standing among you, him you do not know, the one coming behind me, the lace of

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.699
whose sandal, I am not worthy to untie.

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:54.549
We have found the Messiah, loved the world so much that he gave his only begotten son,

00:00:54.549 --> 00:01:05.030
so that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed, but have everlasting

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.030
life.
