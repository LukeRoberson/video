00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:07.679
Turn your life around so that seasons of refreshing may come from Jehovah himself.

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:13.839
Those words changed my life and they saved the life of my little girl.

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:30.859
I was raised in a witness family but I chose a dark underworld of practically everything that

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:40.299
Jehovah hates. After about 15 years, although financially secure, I was confronted with the

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:51.460
failure that my life had become. I was trying to raise a child while addicted to drugs.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.380
I just didn't want to live like that anymore and I wanted to be a good mother.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.659
So for the first time in years, I prayed to Jehovah.

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:21.950
The knock came on my door the very next day. I began studying with a vengeance. I had 15 years to catch

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:33.819
up on. I had a lot of help. I progressively changed my lifestyle. I changed my associates and I conquered

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:39.579
my addictions. I slowly began to overcome feelings of worthlessness.

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:49.469
So none of these changes were easy to make but it made me feel clean and happy knowing that Jehovah was

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:56.269
pleased. My burning desire at that point really was to begin sharing with other people what I was

00:01:56.269 --> 00:02:02.430
learning. But I didn't qualify to engage in the public ministry because I was still living with

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.989
my boyfriend at the time and he didn't understand some of the changes I was making.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:14.669
I was determined to turn my life around and overcome this last hurdle that was preventing me from

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:28.180
serving Jehovah fully. Two weeks later, I found out I was pregnant. I was devastated. I didn't know

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.580
what all those people who had helped me what they would think and how Jehovah felt about what was

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:46.900
happening. I was so ashamed. I actually blamed Jehovah for letting it happen. I was so confused.

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:58.180
My first inclination was just to get an abortion but deep down I knew that was wrong. I thought now

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:06.560
everyone would know that I'm still the worthless person that I always knew I was. At that point,

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:15.629
I just felt like giving up. I told my aunt and uncle Jehovah's Witnesses about my situation.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:23.550
They didn't judge me at all but they did offer a curious suggestion. They invited me up to

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:31.469
Bethel for a visit. They introduced me to an elder who was very kind and I talked to him about my

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:41.870
situation. I was shocked by how loving he was so he shared with me Acts 319. Repent

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:50.990
therefore and turn around so as to get your sins blotted out at seasons of refreshing may come from

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:59.949
the person of Jehovah. Well, he told me I had already sinned but why should I sin a second time?

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:06.990
Why should this innocent child pay for what I had done wrong? He suggested I teach my baby about

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:15.550
Jehovah and raise the child up to know him and have a friendship with him. I loved that he took

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:22.509
something that was sad and depressing for me and turned it into something beautiful.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.750
Well, I had a new plan now. I was really determined to do everything I had to do to turn my life

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:34.910
around in order to please Jehovah. So eventually I qualified to become an unbaptized publisher

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:44.670
and later I was baptized in 2010. I gave birth to a healthy baby girl. I already dedicated my life

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:52.350
to Jehovah so two of my goals are to get baptized and pioneer. I'm as determined as ever to raise

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:59.949
Julie up to love Jehovah and to avoid the traps that almost cost us our lives.
