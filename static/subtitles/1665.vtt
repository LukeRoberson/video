00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:06.830
Our team met a sister from Louisiana in the United States who spent many years as a political

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.589
activist, hoping to make a difference by changing the decisions of a secular government.

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:20.649
But instead, the truth transformed her life.

00:00:20.649 --> 00:00:22.929
My name's Nancy Simon.

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:28.050
I'm a private music teacher in a small town in southwest Louisiana.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.450
I have a very productive and a happy, satisfying life.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.770
But it wasn't always that way.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:43.409
Back in the 1970s, I became involved with a group of young people who were heavily involved

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:48.530
in protesting the government and in particular, the Vietnam War.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:56.789
We felt so strongly about the war that we actually blockaded a presidential candidate in his

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.969
hotel so that he would come down and talk to us.

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.810
In that time period, I also became heavily involved with drug use.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.890
As a matter of fact, I would say that it was pretty much a constant stream of drug use

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.409
just about every day.

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.290
Sometimes I knew what drugs I was using and sometimes I didn't because other people would

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.250
give them to me and I would accept that.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.930
Drugs led to a lot of immorality and my sense of what was right and what was wrong was

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.769
really affected and I just didn't care anymore.

00:01:34.769 --> 00:01:37.409
I didn't care what people thought.

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.209
I didn't care if something was a sin.

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:49.010
I did whatever I wanted to do and with whoever I wanted to be involved with.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.489
One night, a friend of mine asked me about my lifestyle and what kind of future could

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:57.250
I foresee for myself living the way I was living.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.890
When he told me that he used to study the Bible, I gave that a little bit of thought and

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.049
I went out and bought a Bible for myself and I started to read it.

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:12.289
What really hit me the hardest I think was when I prayed and realized that God heard

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:18.210
my prayer in spite of the fact that I had so turned my back on him in the past.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.650
But when I was ready to come back to him, he was ready to have me.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:30.569
Then July the 10th, 1973, this friend of mine asked me if I would marry him.

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.729
I said yes and he had been studying with the witnesses so he also asked me if I would

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:41.009
go to the kingdom hall with him and I said yes to that too.

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:46.610
After the meeting, a couple invited us to have a Bible study with them and that night

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.129
I took the book, the truth that leads to eternal life and I read that book from one end of

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:58.469
it to the other end and I knew that I had found the truth.

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:04.389
That very same day, I immediately started making changes in my life.

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:11.830
Both Harry and I knew that this had to be all or nothing and within that same year,

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.949
both of us were baptized as Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:22.509
Forty-one years, Harry and I have been happily serving Jehovah together and we are so grateful

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:27.949
to Jehovah that he gives us the help that we need to keep our marriage happy for all

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:31.310
these many years.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.789
Another great blessing we have is that our two wonderful girls have been able to avoid

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:42.629
falling into some of these pitfalls that I experienced and the reason why is because

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:50.229
they were raised according to Bible standards that were taught to us by Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:55.110
Almost every year for the last 20 years, Harry and I have been able to travel to remote

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:02.669
areas to help different congregations and bringing the message of God's kingdom to people.

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:10.990
Along the way, we made many true lasting friendships and what a contrast this is with the people

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.509
that we used to protest with.

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:23.110
I know that I owe all of this to my loving father in heaven, Jehovah, and I would hope

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:30.269
that everybody who's possibly has experienced some of the things that I've gone through in

00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:36.189
my life would give the Bible a chance to be able to help them the way that it's been

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:37.189
able to help me.
