00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.620
Let's look at Matthew 1129 in its entirety.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.619
It comes after Jesus made a rather profound statement in verse 27.

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:16.620
Do you have that Matthew 1127?

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.620
Jesus said, All things have been handed over to me by my Father

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.620
and no one fully knows the Son except the Father.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.620
Neither does anyone fully know the Father except the Son.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:36.619
But then he adds, And anyone to whom the Son is willing to reveal him.

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:39.619
Isn't that profound?

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:46.619
Part of Jesus' mission in coming to the earth was to more clearly reveal Jehovah's thinking and personality.

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:50.619
Now with that thought in mind, let's read verse 29.

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:56.929
Take my oak upon you and learn from me.

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:59.929
For I am mild tempered and lowly in heart.

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:02.929
And you will find refreshment for yourselves.

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:09.930
Verse 30 has the detail for my oak is kindly and my load is light.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.930
I think we all know what it means being mild tempered.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.930
But what about lowly in heart?

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.930
Well, our study notes explain that that means humble and unpretentious.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:32.930
Now what can we glean if we magnify verse 29?

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.930
Well, let's start with the yoke.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.930
That's a neck yoke depicted on screen.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.930
And I think we can often picture two animals yoke together.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.930
In this case, it's a head yoke.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:53.930
By the look on the cattle's faces, they don't seem particularly thrilled to be yoke together like that.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:00.930
But it allows them to unitedly pull in the same direction and accomplish a common task.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.930
However, Jesus said in verse 30, my oak is kindly.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.930
Some farmers kindly padded the yoke for that purpose.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.930
Jesus' yoke is comfortable for us.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.930
But you notice in the verse, he said, take my yoke.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.930
What are we to understand from that?

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.930
Well, insight offers two possibilities.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:34.930
The first is if Jesus' yoke is one that Jesus or Jehovah places on Jesus,

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.930
then that signifies that others can get under the yoke with Jesus and he'll assist them.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.930
But the second possibility.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.930
If Jesus' yoke refers to one that Jesus puts on us,

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:55.930
then the reference is that we submit to his authority and direction as his disciples.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.930
The September 2019 watch tower alludes to those same two possibilities.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.930
Now the yoke is an illustration.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.930
Our publications have applied it to Jesus putting his yoke on us.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.069
Let's extend the illustration a little.

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:24.069
Farmers often train their oxen to respond to verbal commands so that they could keep their hands on the plow

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.069
and not have to deal with the reins and the plow.

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:34.069
The governing body could be likened to the voice of Jesus, the head of the congregation.

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:43.069
So when we willingly submit the faithful slave, we're ultimately submitting to Jesus' authority and direction.

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:48.069
And that nicely harmonizes with Matthew 28, 18 through 20.

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:56.069
You recall Jesus had considerable authority as a human on earth.

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:01.069
But looking at the context of Matthew 28, 18,

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:06.069
Jesus words here were spoken after he was resurrected to the spirit life.

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.069
Now you'd not yet ascended to his father,

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.069
but since Jehovah spoke to him as a human,

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:18.069
likely he communicated with Jesus immediately after his resurrection

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:22.069
because that was the ultimate sacrifice for mankind.

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:30.069
So now the resurrected Jesus says in Matthew 28, 18,

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:38.319
all authority, all authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:40.319
Well, back to Matthew 1129.

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:44.319
It says, if we take that yoke,

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:49.319
we will find refreshment for ourselves.

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:51.319
That sounds wonderful, doesn't it?

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:58.110
Relaxing, luxurious, sweet refreshment.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.110
But that's not the intent.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.110
A yoke does not represent a vacation.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.110
A yoke in and of itself implies work.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.110
A farmer does not put cattle in a yoke

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.110
and send them out to graze in a refreshing pasture.

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.110
He puts them in a yoke to accomplish work.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.110
Well, Jesus now has authority in heaven.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.110
So the resurrected anointed one's refreshment

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.110
does not mean floating on a cloud, strumming a harp

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.110
as Christendom sometimes suggests.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.110
Jesus' personality did not change when he went to heaven

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.110
and a yoke refers to meaningful work,

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.110
but Jesus is mild tempered,

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.110
so that work is kindly and refreshing.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.110
And just think of the near future.

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.110
Try to imagine all of the anointed following

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.110
in Jesus' direction at Armageddon.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.110
They're going to assist in dismantling

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.110
Satan's entire wicked system.

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.110
That is work.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.110
But since it's under Jesus' direction,

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.110
that work is refreshing.

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.110
It's invigorating.

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.110
It's fulfilling.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.110
And for those of us on earth,

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.110
refreshment does not mean lounging

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.110
in our favorite easy chair with the beverage of our choice.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.110
We have work to do.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.110
But the yoke is padded.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.110
It's kindly.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.110
We don't chafe under it.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.110
Jesus is mild tempered.

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.110
Now, back to Matthew 1129,

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.110
did you notice Jesus said,

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.110
and learn from me?

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.110
Why did he include those words?

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.110
The sentence would have made perfect sense without them.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.110
But he specifically said, and learn from me.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.110
Now, why might that be significant?

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.110
Well, what about contrast?

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:02.110
Who had Jesus' followers learn from all their lives?

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.110
It was the religious leaders of the day.

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.110
What a contrast between their attitude and personality

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:11.110
when compared with Jesus.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:14.110
Matthew 23, please.

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:19.189
His disciples have learned from the scribes and Pharisees,

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:24.189
and so they had picked up a flaws in their attitude and personality.

00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:26.189
And as we read Matthew 23, 4,

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:29.189
please allow Matthew 1130 to be ringing in your ear.

00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:31.189
Do you recall?

00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:32.189
Jesus said,

00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:34.189
My load is light.

00:07:34.189 --> 00:07:37.189
Well, what had the disciples learn previously

00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:40.189
from the religious leaders, 23, 4?

00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:43.189
They bind up, not light,

00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:45.189
but heavy loads,

00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:47.189
and put them on the shoulders of men.

00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:49.189
And if you glance at verse 5,

00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:53.189
you'll see that they'd like to piously be seen by men.

00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:58.189
They'd like the most prominent seats and meals in the synagogue.

00:07:58.189 --> 00:08:01.189
But now, verse 11,

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:03.189
Learn from Jesus.

00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:04.189
He said,

00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:08.189
But the greatest among you must be your minister.

00:08:08.189 --> 00:08:13.189
Do you remember an entrenched personality flaw of the apostles?

00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:15.189
They often defaulted,

00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:18.189
and to argue about who's the greatest one among us.

00:08:18.189 --> 00:08:20.189
They likely learned that

00:08:20.189 --> 00:08:23.189
from the religious leaders, poor example.

00:08:23.189 --> 00:08:27.189
So it makes sense in our text today that Jesus pleaded,

00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:29.189
Learn from me.

00:08:29.189 --> 00:08:31.189
And in fact, I am different.

00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:32.190
Learn.

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:36.190
I am mild-tempered and lowly in heart.

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:40.190
While the Yoke of Jesus does definitely include disciple-making,

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:46.190
we need to learn Jesus in all aspects of Christian discipleship.

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.190
First, but you're 221.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:49.190
It says,

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:52.190
He left a model for us to follow with steps closely.

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:53.190
That verse,

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:56.190
the context does not talk about the preaching work.

00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:00.190
It's talking about dealing with suffering and interpersonal relationships.

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:02.190
For example, 3-1, it says,

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.190
In the same way as the model,

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:07.190
you wives be in subjection to your husband.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:08.190
3-7.

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:09.190
It says,

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:10.190
In the same way,

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:11.190
husbands treat your wife.

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:14.190
In verse chapter 3, verse 8,

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.190
It's addressed to all of us interacting with one another.

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:23.190
It has four beautiful Christ-like qualities we need to display with one another.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:25.190
Now it's true,

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.190
due to him perfection

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:30.190
and misunderstandings,

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:33.190
we all make mistakes.

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:37.190
But the baseline is.

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:40.190
Learn from Jesus,

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:43.190
including the fact that he was mild-tempered

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:45.190
and lowly in heart.
