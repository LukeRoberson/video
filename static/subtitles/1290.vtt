00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:10.599
The earth is home to over 7 billion people divided into countless cultures and languages.

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:16.600
People are on the move, and in many lands immigrant populations are growing.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.600
These cultural differences are often an obstacle to true communication.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.600
And yet, there exists a group of people united the world over by the pure language of truth.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:39.649
Together they joyfully feed on published spiritual food, prepared just right and translated into languages that touch their hearts.

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.649
How is this work being accomplished?

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:53.929
And how can you have a share in the fulfilment of prophecy that everlasting good news is being declared to those of every nation, tribe and tongue?

00:00:53.929 --> 00:01:04.180
Over 6,000 different languages are spoken on earth today.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:11.180
Even though some may speak of more common language, why is it important to learn the good news in their native tongue?

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.180
When you learn another language, it's an intellectual exercise.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:24.180
But you may not feel the same way emotionally about the words that you're learning as you would with your own language, the language which you were born.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.180
While I was in Tahiti, there in Tahiti people speak Tahitian and French.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.180
And my wife and I were visiting with a family, the wife spoke some English.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:42.180
So I was asking her, now what language is easier for you? French or Tahitian?

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.180
They are the same.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.180
I said, what language do you dream in?

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.180
I dream in both.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.180
Then I said, when you're angry with your husband, what language do you use Tahitian?

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.180
And that little antidote highlights that language is something close to the heart.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.180
The language that we speak when we're eating, when we're emotionally feeling strong about a certain subject,

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.180
that's usually the language is best to initially hear the truth in.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:19.180
To reach these diverse peoples with the good news, accurate translation of Bible truth is necessary.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.180
But where and how is this translation work done?

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.180
It is done by thousands of volunteers around the world in various circumstances.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.180
Many translation teams work at the local branch facilities of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:43.180
others work at translation offices, ideally near where their particular language is primarily spoken.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:53.180
For example, in the city of Amzuzu in northern Malawi, a translation team of 16 works at the location of a former missionary home.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:04.180
The Chitambuka language is their assignment, and this location puts them right in the middle of their territory of approximately 1 million people.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:12.180
The translation team, along with others assigned for support, start the day together with a spiritual discussion.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:21.180
It's another time to begin our morning worship program, and therefore, like to ask rather a million young guys to introduce the text.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:31.180
Typically, they will then begin working in small groups. The first step is thorough preparation.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.180
During preparation, we read the whole text carefully and look up the scriptures,

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.180
and if there's a difficult text, we think of how we can solve it.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.180
After that, they begin translating.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.180
One does the initial translation, another checks the translation against the English,

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:58.180
and the third one proof reads the Tumbuka text for clarity and naturalness.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:05.180
It is demanding work, and it comes with its own set of unique challenges.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.180
It may be that some articles explain things that are unknown to a Malawiian audience.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:18.180
They are known only in other countries. Sometimes they use illustrations that cannot be understood here, because people have never seen them.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:26.180
If we just retain some illustrations without thinking about our audience, chances are high our audience would miss the point.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.180
On this challenge, Jehovah's Organization is helping us. We receive ongoing training.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.180
First, to understand English and translate not words, but thoughts,

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:44.180
so that when our brothers receive the publication, they can understand and be encouraged.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:51.180
For translators in remote areas, there's great satisfaction in seeing the words of truth and print,

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:57.180
and from the appreciation in the field.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.180
We feel good preaching using the publications we have translated,

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:07.180
because during translation time, it's like you are not very sure how people will react after reading the article,

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.180
or they understand the point, but when you go out preaching using those books,

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:20.180
you show them the magazines. Their reaction tells you that your translation was clear.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:28.180
The translation team for the Maya language is located in Merida, on the Yucatan Peninsula in eastern Mexico.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:35.180
This location puts them in the middle of their language territory of over 900,000 people.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:42.709
To improve their work, the translators regularly interview local Maya brothers and sisters,

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:48.709
regarding the accuracy and meaning of expressions difficult to translate.

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:54.709
It is a necessary technique, because in those indigenous languages to which we translate,

00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:58.709
or in sign languages, there are no works of reference.

00:05:58.709 --> 00:06:05.709
There is very little information written. The translators don't have dictionaries in cyclopedias or newspapers,

00:06:05.709 --> 00:06:12.709
and they cannot consult the internet about how the ideas are expressed, or how some terms are used.

00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:22.709
Then the field test is necessary, so that the translator can have confidence that what he is writing is really how it should be.

00:06:22.709 --> 00:06:31.709
We have learned which words are not too common anymore, and which words are known more widely in the territory.

00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:41.709
The translated publications are having good results. For example, in 2005, there were 116 Maya congregations in Mexico.

00:06:41.709 --> 00:06:52.709
When the Require brochure and Bible stories book were released that year, they added 42 congregations in just eight months.

00:06:52.709 --> 00:06:57.709
Increasingly, more effort is being focused on smaller groups of language speakers.

00:06:57.709 --> 00:07:07.709
For example, Native Americans living in Canada on the Blood Tribe Reserve are hearing the Kingdom message in the Blackfoot language.

00:07:07.709 --> 00:07:15.709
A congregation of about 50 publishers in southern Alberta preaches to a population of over 15,000.

00:07:15.709 --> 00:07:21.709
They cover this vast territory working with a limited number of Blackfoot publications.

00:07:21.709 --> 00:07:30.709
The translation team works at the home of Bert Talman, brother Talman is a blood tribe member, and along with other native speakers,

00:07:30.709 --> 00:07:33.709
they are working to produce more tools for their ministry.

00:07:33.709 --> 00:07:40.709
The title of the track is You Can Trust the Creator. This one was written especially for Native people.

00:07:40.709 --> 00:07:49.709
When you open the track and you see the pictures on there too, there's a picture of a Native chief on their chief Joseph.

00:07:49.709 --> 00:07:56.709
People can identify right away with that, and the beautiful paradise scene, they're all Native people in there.

00:07:56.709 --> 00:08:03.709
Sometimes it reminds them of how conditions must have been in the past with the Native people, but we always tell them,

00:08:03.709 --> 00:08:10.709
this is the promise that our creators holding out to us for the future, and so that really touches their heart.

00:08:10.709 --> 00:08:18.709
There's been a lot of misrepresentation by Christendom and other religions.

00:08:18.709 --> 00:08:27.709
Because of this lack of trust that has developed over the years from their experience, from Christendom's religions,

00:08:27.709 --> 00:08:34.710
they have a hard time trusting in non-Native religions.

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:45.710
A lot of Native people have been hurt in the past by broken promises, so this track helps them to see that there is a creator who doesn't break his promises.

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:52.710
Everything he's promised has come true, and so the things he's promised for the future, they can trust it.

00:08:52.710 --> 00:09:01.710
When we show them that we have something especially for them in the black foot language, and they see it, and to see their eyes light up,

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:04.710
they're so happy like, wow, this is for us.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:09.710
Well, I remember one girl when I showed her the creator track. She was a young girl, and she took it out of my hand.

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:16.710
She looked at it, and she said, you mean this was made just for Native people? This is made for us.

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:23.710
And I said, yeah, it was made just for you. And she kept looking at and turning the page over, and she was pretty amazed by that.

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:30.710
She kept saying, wow, it was really nice to see that reaction because they feel like they are special.

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:36.710
The creator is really thinking of them, and they're not just being pushed aside or forgotten.

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:44.710
We read about experiences in the yearbook where in other countries, there's great efforts going on to help them,

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:49.710
and we never thought as Native people that we would be a part of that.

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:56.710
And so now to see the attention there on that tube is so heartwarming, and it's very, very encouraging,

00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:12.179
and it makes us want to do our very best to try and help as many people as we can.

00:10:12.179 --> 00:10:16.179
This is no ordinary literature delivery to the branch office in Kigali, Rwanda.

00:10:16.179 --> 00:10:24.500
Translated locally, the contents were printed in the United States. They traveled by boat to South Africa,

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:30.500
then rode a truck over land for eight days to arrive at their final destination.

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:40.500
And today, the governing body is pleased to announce the release of the complete new world translation of Holy Scriptures in the Kingdom of Rwanda language.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:57.889
How happy I was. I was so full of joy that I wanted to stand up and dance,

00:10:57.889 --> 00:11:01.889
but it was not possible to do it in the middle of the talk. I was very happy.

00:11:03.889 --> 00:11:10.889
How can I explain it? Yesterday, when this Bible was released, I shed tears of joy.

00:11:10.889 --> 00:11:18.889
It's like the expectation made my heart sick, and when I got the thing desired, my heart healed.

00:11:18.889 --> 00:11:24.889
So the thing desired is the Bible that we have waited for for years.

00:11:24.889 --> 00:11:29.889
Now, because that thing desired has come, my heart is no longer sick.

00:11:34.889 --> 00:11:41.940
Now, God's Word can be clearly read in the language of the heart.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:49.940
What indescribable joy I felt, I looked at the heavens, and I thanked our Heavenly Father.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:58.940
For me, it is difficult to express the way I am feeling. I am happier than ever.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:05.940
During the release talk, tears were about to come from my eyes because of the joy of having the Bible in Kingdom of Rwanda.

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:17.700
I am determined to continue to thank Jehovah and to trust his organization because I have evidence that his organization is real and international.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:24.700
The release of this Bible touched my heart. I was about to cry because of joy.

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:31.700
I do not know how I can express my feelings. It is beyond my expectations.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:40.700
Translated material, all freely available and supported by voluntary donations, is having a good effect in the field.

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:48.700
As for me, I have appreciated it. It will help me not only in the ministry, but also in personal study.

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.700
I am eager to start reading it from cover to cover.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:13:05.340
This Bible will help me in my personal study and it will help me in the ministry because I will use it with full confidence.

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:15.169
Knowing that anywhere I read, it has been accurately translated. That made me really happy.

00:13:15.169 --> 00:13:19.169
It will be a pleasure to read it because it is easy to understand.

00:13:19.169 --> 00:13:25.169
We used to read other versions which used archaic words that were difficult, even though they were in our own language.

00:13:25.169 --> 00:13:35.740
But having this Bible well translated, I think that will help us to apply what we learn in order for us to be closer to Jehovah than ever.

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:45.740
Most Rwandis do not know foreign languages and they only speak in Rwanda. When they receive publications in their language, they are interested in the good news increases.

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:57.500
In the recent past, other publication releases in Rwanda have touched our brothers deeply.

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:05.500
At the release of the new songbook, we sang that song about the resurrection and at the end of it, brothers were crying.

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:12.500
Guess why? Because they understood what they were singing. Why don't they cry when they sing in French?

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:22.500
They can understand the words of the songs, but in a foreign language, it is difficult for the message to touch the emotions in our heart.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:30.500
But your mother tongue speaks to the heart and arouses the emotions.

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:36.500
The availability of the songbook in Kenya Rwanda, it was the happiest moment at Bethel.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:42.500
The sisters were so happy. They were joining their voices and they sang in loud voices.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:48.500
Because we were working in offices, we wondered what was happening. But those sisters told us,

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:56.500
you translators, we are very grateful because of your work. It touched my heart very much.

00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:06.309
For more than a century, Jehovah's Witnesses have made a priority of translating Bible truth.

00:15:06.309 --> 00:15:13.309
At the making of this video, we translate in over 600 languages with more being added regularly.

00:15:13.309 --> 00:15:17.309
No group anywhere even attempts such a task.

00:15:17.309 --> 00:15:27.309
The Watchtower magazine is produced in over 200 languages and it is the only journal that is published regularly in some 50 of those languages.

00:15:27.309 --> 00:15:35.309
In scores of other languages, Jehovah's Witnesses produced the only literature that is readily and freely available to the people.

00:15:36.309 --> 00:15:43.879
Typically, the publisher growth in these languages is much higher than the worldwide average.

00:15:43.879 --> 00:15:48.879
In recent years, more emphasis has been given toward the effort to translate the Bible.

00:15:48.879 --> 00:15:56.879
In 2005, the New World Translation was available in whole or in part in 56 languages.

00:15:56.879 --> 00:16:04.879
But in just seven years, by 2012, the number of languages more than doubled to 117.

00:16:04.879 --> 00:16:20.039
So what if we meet someone in our ministry who speaks another language?

00:16:20.039 --> 00:16:28.039
Nihao, Wajau, perhaps we can learn just a few words or a simple presentation in that language.

00:16:28.039 --> 00:16:32.039
And we can always make full use of the tools available.

00:16:32.039 --> 00:16:40.039
They first of all need to ascertain, could they use publications such as the Good News booklet and ascertain what language.

00:16:40.039 --> 00:16:45.039
And then hope the person by letting them read the message that's been printed there.

00:16:45.039 --> 00:16:50.039
In addition to that, we encourage them to go onto the website.

00:16:50.039 --> 00:16:56.039
Many of these languages already have files there that can be printed and downloaded.

00:16:56.039 --> 00:16:59.039
And perhaps they could be passed immediately onto the person.

00:16:59.039 --> 00:17:08.039
It's always interesting to see the look of surprise on someone's face when maybe the next day or even that same day the publisher comes back.

00:17:08.039 --> 00:17:15.440
And here they have a printout of something in their own language.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:19.440
By filling out the please follow up form for foreign language speaking people that you meet,

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:23.440
a visit can be arranged by someone who speaks their language.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:27.440
These referrals are coordinated by the local branches.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.440
Good morning. Good morning.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.440
I had a really nice call.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.440
Were you standing in for me?

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.440
I certainly will. Great.

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:44.440
Taking it a step further, some publishers have embarked on learning a new language by enrolling in classes organized by individual branches.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:53.440
This group of publishers is learning Chinese in order to speak to a growing local population where they live in New Jersey, USA.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:58.440
It's helping to give me the confidence to practice more in the field.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:11.440
Instead of going right to my English and apologizing that I don't know much Chinese, it's forcing me to practice what we're learning in the class in the field and actually use it with Chinese people.

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:18.440
One of the language class principles is to use the course material as soon as possible in the field.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:22.440
Often times the students will see fast results.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:29.440
Immediately, the very first door I went to in Chinese, the people were so impressed that we were trying to learn Chinese that they invited us right in.

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:33.440
People come to the meeting just from giving them an invitation. They're so excited.

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:37.440
And they just want to know what the truth is about and it's nice to see that excitement.

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.440
Well, they want to know why are you learning Chinese?

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.440
Why would you attempt to learn such a difficult language?

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:51.440
And so when we tell them it's because we want to teach the Bible and we want people to know the good things in the Bible, they're very interested.

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:55.440
When you extend yourself out there and then you see the positive response.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:00.440
Just being able to extend yourself and see the rewards is just wonderful.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:07.440
For some, knowing a language reasonably well can open up opportunities for expanded service.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:14.440
A number of publishers have chosen to serve in foreign language fields by moving to those territories in other countries.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:23.440
Ecuador has long benefited from the preaching work carried on by those willing to serve in areas of greater need.

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:28.440
I presently we have about 600 foreigners from 23 different countries serving here.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:33.440
We have people from all walks of life and all ages, even some that come down here with small children.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:41.440
Some are young and use their energy to go out into rough territory, they're walking, they're biking, they're using local transportation.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:49.440
Others with more years, they're using the maternity to stabilize the congregations and all have been a significant factor in the steady growth here in Ecuador.

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:54.440
We wanted to be somewhere where the ministry was productive, where people really would respond when we spoke to them.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:58.440
So that was one thing and the other thing is simply the time we wanted to spend more time in the service.

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:06.440
And because of the economy we had to work a lot and so when we changed to a different economy we were able to have more time for the ministry.

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:15.440
Because we were a nice congregation but it was very difficult to find a lot of studies and we had seven elders at that time.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:25.440
And then when you hear of congregations here where they have one elder, zero elders and where you can make a greater contribution, wow, this is what we want to do.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:33.440
The field service in these lands will likely be much more productive than in the more affluent countries they have left behind.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:38.440
The ministry, before I didn't have any studies, I would never have dreamed of having to study in.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:43.440
But now I have returned visits, I have studies and it's a lot easier.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:54.440
Well people answer the doors a lot, they want to study, they progress and people get baptized, maybe even in the same year that they start studying.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:21:01.440
Just to give you an example of the blessings that one can have, there was a brother with his wife here for a span of 10 years.

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:10.440
During those 10 years he saw the number of congregations in his city go from two to ten and he helps start five of those congregations.

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:18.440
And during those 10 years he and his wife had on the average two people that they brought to baptism each year.

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:23.440
Families with children see amazing benefits and not just in the ministry.

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:28.440
One reason we did this is to be able to focus on our children, raising them in the truth.

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:39.440
So we felt like we didn't really have much time to waste and so we got busy trying to put ourselves in the situation so that we could focus on our children and help them to grow up and be strong on the truth.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:46.440
The big thing is that we have time as a family, we spend more time in the ministry, more time just relaxing together.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:52.440
And so that's really good and we've seen Drew progress significantly since we've arrived.

00:21:52.440 --> 00:22:01.440
She had spiritual goals before but now she talks about what she wants to go to Bethel, she wants to be a missionary and she was just baptized a few months ago.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:05.440
So she's really took a hold of the truth solid.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:10.440
That's been the biggest thing for us is to see her progress.

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:19.440
Well just experiencing everything here, all the Bible studies and mom and dad have a lot of nice studies and it's really nice.

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:25.440
We're not focused on material pursuits and obviously under God's Kingdom we're not going to be focused on our career.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:32.440
We're going to be focused on doing just what your hubby tells us to do, we're happy, we're united as a family and we have, we feel like we have a little purpose.

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:36.440
However, there are some challenges.

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:48.440
There's going to be a lot more work because that's why it's called a greater need and there's a lot more work with the congregations, a lot more work with the brothers and a lot more work even in the field service.

00:22:48.440 --> 00:23:02.440
And you walk a lot sometimes for miles and we're physically tired but there's just so much more joy because you know you're using your life the way you're supposed to be using it, the way it was meant to be used and it's just a better way of life overall.

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:07.440
It doesn't feel like we left something behind, this is where we want to be.

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:14.440
The wonderful thing about translation work is that it proved Jehovah's love for each individual.

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:23.440
Language divides people and obviously since the time of the Tower of Babel we've seen a lot of divisions, earth wide.

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:29.440
And yet the pure language of Bible truth is something that unites God's people.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:48.440
Jehovah's Witnesses stand out as absolutely different from any other organization because here we have all these volunteer workers that are translating, putting the message into other languages so that we have the same logic, the same goal and all worship the same God.
