00:00:02.319 --> 00:00:06.320
How will the kingdom benefit its citizens?

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:12.320
When on earth Jesus showed through his miracles what God's kingdom would do.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:21.600
When Jesus calmed a storm, he showed that as king, he will control earth's natural forces,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.600
solving environmental problems.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.600
By miraculously feeding thousands,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:36.299
he demonstrated that the kingdom will eliminate world hunger.

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:41.299
When Jesus healed the sick, lame, death and blind,

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:50.950
he gave us a preview of the perfect health that all will enjoy under his rule.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:58.950
And by resurrecting people, he showed that through the kingdom he will reverse death itself.
