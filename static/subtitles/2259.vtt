00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.960
Let's face it. You're busy.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.960
Keeping up with friends,

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.960
keeping up with school,

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.960
and maybe even keeping a job.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.010
So when it comes to keeping things clean,

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.010
who has time for that?

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.010
But here are three reasons why being clean is something we should all make time for.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.009
First, it shows respect for others.

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:38.960
Second,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.960
it makes you feel good about yourself.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.780
And third,

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.780
it can actually make your life easier and less stressful.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.689
So how can you do it?

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:55.689
Start with the basics.

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:57.689
Wash your hands often.

00:00:58.689 --> 00:01:00.689
Especially before meals.

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:02.689
And after using the restroom,

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:07.019
this gets rid of germs.

00:01:07.019 --> 00:01:11.579
And keeps you healthy.

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:13.579
Make it a habit to wash regularly

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:17.579
after any sports or intense activities.

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:20.930
Don't forget your teeth.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.819
They need cleaning too.

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.439
And ask your parents how to do laundry.

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:31.439
Because when you leave home,

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.439
you may have to do it for yourself.

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:38.719
So always make time to organize and clean your home,

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:40.719
your car,

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:43.719
and anything else that's important to you.

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:47.859
The Bible says a smart person

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:50.859
sees the wisdom of everything being done properly

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:55.739
and in order.

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:57.739
Yes, you are busy.

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:03.299
But don't be too busy.

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.299
To keep things clean.
