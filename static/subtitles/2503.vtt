00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.780
I drew a family in school today.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.280
Oh, wow!

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.280
I didn't have time to finish Caleb's face.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.280
Carried you two mommies.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.280
She told me they're married to each other.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.780
My teacher says that all that matters is that people love each other and that they're happy.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.780
Well, people have their own ideas about what is right and wrong.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.780
But what matters is how Jehovah feels.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.780
He wants us to be happy, and he knows how we can be happiest.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.280
That's why he invented marriage the way he did.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.280
You mean one man and one woman?

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.780
Exactly! Look at Genesis 127.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.780
Jehovah created Adam and Eve, male and female.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.280
Then in Genesis 2.24, he said that a man will stick to his wife.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.280
Later, Jesus said the same thing.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.280
Jehovah's standards haven't changed.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.280
It's kind of like going on an airplane.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.780
What would happen if someone wanted to bring something on the plane that wasn't allowed?

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.780
It couldn't go on the trip.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.780
Right!

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.780
It's the same with Jehovah.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.780
He wants us to be his friend and live in paradise forever.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.780
But we have to follow his standards to get there.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.780
At Matthew 7, 13, and 14, it talks about the road leading to paradise.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.780
To get there, Jehovah says we have to leave some things behind.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.780
That means anything Jehovah doesn't approve of.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.200
Everyone to get to paradise.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.200
So does Jehovah, and you know what?

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.200
People can change.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.200
That's why we share his message.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.200
So, what can you say to Kerry?

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.200
Well, I could tell her about the paradise.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.200
I could tell her about the animals and the resurrection.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.199
That's awesome!

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:09.199
Let's practice!
