00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:13.599
Mom, something's burning.

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.099
Got it.

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:16.600
Did you brush your teeth yet?

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.600
Mom.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.600
No, Mom.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.600
We're running late.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.600
Come on, go brush your teeth.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.600
Aiden, are you dressed?

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.600
Come here, baby.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.600
Your shirt is inside out.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.600
Aiden.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.600
Okay.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.600
Madison.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.600
We got to be out the door in five minutes.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.130
Other arm.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.979
Are we good?

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:41.979
Okay.

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:42.979
One more time.

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:45.979
What did we learn from what we read today in the Daily Times?

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:46.979
It's about ASA, right?

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:47.979
Very good.

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:48.979
And?

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:51.979
We don't want to envy people that don't love Jehovah.

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:52.979
Very good.

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:53.979
So, question.

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:57.979
When kids at school do things that look like fun,

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:00.979
but we know that Jehovah doesn't like, what should we do?

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:01.979
Right.

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:02.979
Perfect.

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:03.979
You're so smart.

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:04.980
Okay.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:10.519
Come on, let's go to the train.

00:01:10.519 --> 00:01:11.519
There are five more minutes to clean.

00:01:11.519 --> 00:01:12.519
The ones that are circled.

00:01:12.519 --> 00:01:13.519
No, okay.

00:01:13.519 --> 00:01:14.519
All right.

00:01:14.519 --> 00:01:18.780
Thanks.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:37.900
Hey, Heather.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.900
Hey, Simone.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:39.900
I just made some tea.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.900
Would you like some?

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:41.900
Thank you.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.200
Sure.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.200
How's your day going?

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.200
Good.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.200
Did you see Laura's pictures?

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.200
No.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.200
Pictures of what?

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.200
Her vacation.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.200
It looks so nice.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.200
That's great.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.200
Oh, did I tell you I'm going the way too?

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.200
Where are you going?

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.200
My boyfriend bought me an all-inclusive vacation package.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.200
And the island retreats sounds really great right now.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.200
Yeah, are you going anywhere taking any trips?

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.200
No, you know, the kids I can't really afford to do my-

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.539
She's made for sure.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.539
Sometimes I just feel so trapped.

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:17.539
I know I need to keep my life simple.

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:20.539
And stay focused on spiritual things.

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:25.539
But it just seems like I'm constantly seeing others around me.

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:28.539
Being rewarded with nice things.

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:31.539
And I just feel forgotten.

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:32.539
Hmm.

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:36.539
When we discussed the text this morning on envy,

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:40.539
I never thought I'd be applying it to myself.

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:46.539
Before I became envious when I would see the peace of the wicked,

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:52.539
what did Aiden say Asaf did to overcome his envy?

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:56.539
But as for me, drawing near to God is good for me.

00:02:56.539 --> 00:03:00.539
I have made the sovereign Lord Jehovah my refuge.

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:02.539
That's right.

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:03.539
He prayed.

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:23.530
And that's exactly what I need to do.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.530
When a pointed servant makes a mistake,

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.530
let us continue to do all things free from hermoring.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.530
Philippians 242.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.530
Does that mean we're going to be late?

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.530
Yes.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:42.530
Yes, we are.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.530
Finish that.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:56.900
I really appreciate the scripture because it helps us to guard against the spirit of the world.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:04.370
And how might these scriptures help us in choosing our entertainment?

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:10.530
Sister Edwards?

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.530
Vampires, werewolves, witches are all associated with the spirit world.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.529
So if our entertainment involves any of these,

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:22.529
we might meditate on Psalms 9710 and ask ourselves,

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:25.529
do I really hate what Jehovah hates?

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:32.230
Sister Thorn.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.230
And let's hear from Young Sister Wakeler.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.230
Any other thoughts before we move on?

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.230
Sister Perez.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.560
Excuse me.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.560
Thanks for all that you've done.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.560
Good night.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.560
You know, we have the congregation cleaning tonight.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.560
Any chance you might be able to take care of the maframs?

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.560
Shormatize is nothing I'd love to do more.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.560
It's not like I'm doing enough of this all day, every day.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.560
Oh, and did I mention how much I appreciate all the brothers not calling on me tonight?

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.560
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.560
Mommy didn't mean that.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.560
It's okay, Mom. I know you're tired.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.560
That's no excuse.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.699
Here, let's go sit together.

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:23.699
I was just frustrated.

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:25.699
I never should have said that.

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:28.699
You know, in the train, I was actually listening to an article

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:30.699
about not murmuring against the elders,

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:32.699
even if they make mistakes.

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:37.699
I guess I should have meditated on that a little more.

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:43.699
Madison, I want you to know that our elders work very, very hard.

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:46.699
Do you remember last week when they came for that shepherding visit?

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:50.699
Yeah, Matias and his wife brought groceries the next day.

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:53.699
That's right. They brought us groceries.

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:56.699
The elders care about us so much,

00:05:56.699 --> 00:05:58.699
and they truly deserve our respect.

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:01.699
I never should have said that.

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:02.699
You understand?

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:03.699
I understand.

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:04.699
Okay. Good girl.

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:05.699
All right, you know what?

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:07.699
Why don't we finish up the mirrors together?

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:08.699
Sound good?

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:09.699
All right.

00:06:09.699 --> 00:07:05.860
Okay.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.860
There's nothing on...

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:09.860
Wait.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.860
This is the show everyone at work has been talking about.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.860
It's supposed to be great,

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:26.100
but it looks really spiritualistic.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:31.100
Vampires, werewolves, witches are all associated with the spirit world.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.100
So if our entertainment involves any of these,

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:38.100
we might meditate on Psalms 9710 and ask ourselves,

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:42.100
do I really hate what Jehovah hates?

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.100
Hmm.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.100
It doesn't look that bad.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.100
But I know Jehovah hates spiritism,

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:53.100
and I want to hate what Jehovah hates.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:57.100
That verse also says Jehovah will guard his loyal ones.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:00.100
I want to show him that I'm...

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.100
one of his loyal ones.
