00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:12.630
The governing body of Jehovah's Witnesses provides spiritual food throughout publications and website.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.129
The writing desk supplies material to the writing department at the World Headquarters of Publication.

00:00:19.129 --> 00:00:23.129
We also archive historical material.

00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:30.820
News paper creepings and experiences are sorted and filed in cabinets.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.820
These are translated into English and sent to the writing department at the World Headquarters.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.320
Also, we arrange the shooting of photographs for articles.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.320
These photographs help us to get a better understanding of what is being taught.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:55.780
The archive team collects historical material of the witnesses in Japan.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:03.780
Such as photos, fabrications from the early days and other mementos which brothers have donated.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:11.780
We take protective measures to save these precious items from damages close by such things as light and humidity.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:21.780
Also, we computerize a collection of items numbering tens of thousands so that we can immediately find any of them from the database.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:31.780
We use these items for exhibition displays as well as video programs produced at this branch or at the World Headquarters.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.780
Like a family album of memories, the collection in the archives tells us much about our spiritual family.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:49.780
About their faith, courage, joys, challenges, and about Jehovah's guidance and support.
