00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:09.300
Welcome. In this month's program, we'll meet a brother who overcame a troubled and violent childhood

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.300
and found genuine love and peace among Jehovah's people.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:21.300
We'll learn how couples can make good decisions and work together even when they don't see eye to eye.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:30.300
And our music video will remind us of why it's important to stop and reflect on every precious minute we have with our loved ones.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.299
Welcome to this month's edition of JW Broadcasting.

00:00:36.299 --> 00:01:02.340
We know what the future holds. Bible prophecy clearly indicates that we are living in the last days.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.340
We understand what events will lead to Amageddon and the arrival of God's new world.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.340
However, we do not know the exact events that will experience personally.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.340
For example, you might wonder, will I experience a natural disaster?

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.340
And if so, what kind of disaster?

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.340
How will persecution affect me? Will I end up in prison?

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.340
As I get older, who will care for me?

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.340
Have you ever asked yourself similar questions?

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.340
Has this uncertainty made you anxious or fearful?

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.340
Such feelings can make it hard to think clearly.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:55.340
But these feelings can go away when we realize that we are well prepared.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.340
For example, do you remember the feature drama from the 2023 Convention?

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.340
Commit your way to Jehovah?

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:15.060
It illustrated how following the organization's direction saved lives during times of political unrest.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:22.060
But is there anything else we can do to be fully equipped for tomorrow?

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.060
Absolutely. In fact, we are preparing ourselves every day.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:35.060
Let's review what we are already doing and why we really have no reason to be fearful or anxious.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:42.729
The Apostle Peter wrote his letters during times of trials and instability.

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:50.729
The brothers and sisters of the first century knew they were living in the last days of the Jewish system of things.

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:55.729
Based on Jesus' warning, they expected personal challenges.

00:02:55.729 --> 00:03:01.729
However, they did not know exactly when and how these events would affect them.

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:09.039
It was impossible for them to plan for every possibility.

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:19.479
And Peter, who was getting older, may have wondered how he and other elderly ones would be cared for later in life.

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:27.479
He may have perceived that aging and declining health could create uncertainty and fear in some.

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:32.479
Doesn't that sound a lot like the situation we were in today?

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:39.889
What did the Apostle Peter recommend in view of future uncertainties?

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:43.889
At 1 Peter 1 verse 13, he said,

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:47.889
So brace up your minds for activity.

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:51.889
Keep your senses completely.

00:03:51.889 --> 00:04:00.889
Set your hope on the undeserved kindness that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:07.889
So did Peter tell the brothers and sisters to stockpile money or supplies? No.

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:13.889
He encouraged them to strengthen their faith and trust in Jehovah.

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:17.889
There are no uncertainties for Jehovah.

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:23.889
He had promised to protect the Christians in the first century, and he would provide salvation.

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:32.199
In verse 13, what are the three things Peter encouraged Christians to do?

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:38.199
One, brace up your minds for activity.

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:43.199
Two, keep your senses completely.

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:48.199
And three, set your hope on the undeserved kindness.

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:56.279
Let's look at each point and see what helps us to be fully equipped for tomorrow.

00:04:56.279 --> 00:05:01.279
First Peter tells us to brace up our minds for activity.

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:05.279
Brace up means to be ready for activity.

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:08.279
What kind of activity?

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:16.279
Among other forms of activity, notice what Peter wrote a little later in his letter at 1 Peter 2 verse 9.

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:24.279
You should declare abroad the excellencies of the one who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:32.279
In the first century, Christians were active in telling others the good news about Jesus Christ.

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:34.279
We do the same today.

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:42.279
We are active in the ministry, sharing the good news that Jesus is king in heaven, and we speak about the hope for all.

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:50.589
Now, how does this sharing in this activity prepare us for the uncertainties of tomorrow?

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:59.160
Talking to others about our hope for the future, strengthens our own conviction and faith.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:06.160
This ministry keeps us focused and we see the positive changes in those we teach.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:13.160
Sharing in this activity depends our gratitude for being part of Jehovah's family.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:19.439
Has this gratitude motivated you to be active in the ministry?

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:26.439
Maybe your circumstances even allow you to share in full-time service.

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:35.439
By being active, you showed Jehovah that his kingdom is the most important thing in your life.

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:41.439
And Jehovah promises to care for those who put his kingdom first.

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:48.439
You are in his protective hands. There is no need to be anxious or fearful.

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:56.439
Therefore, being active in the ministry is the first step towards being prepared for tomorrow.

00:06:56.439 --> 00:07:04.459
Next, the Apostle Peter tells us to keep our senses completely.

00:07:04.459 --> 00:07:08.459
This means being balanced in our thinking.

00:07:08.459 --> 00:07:18.459
Thus, we are able to evaluate matters properly, come to the right conclusions and make good decisions.

00:07:18.459 --> 00:07:21.459
Isn't this what we want?

00:07:21.459 --> 00:07:27.459
How can we make good decisions, especially when we face unexpected events in our life?

00:07:27.459 --> 00:07:34.930
In developing Christian qualities helps us keep our senses.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:39.930
For instance, Peter mentions one important quality at 2 Peter 2 verse 9.

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:46.930
So then, Jehovah knows how to rescue people of godly devotion out of trial.

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:53.930
So what quality can help us to keep our senses completely and make good decisions?

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:55.930
It's godly devotion.

00:07:55.930 --> 00:08:00.930
This means being loyal to Jehovah and doing what he asks.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:06.930
Is this not what we promised to do when we dedicated our lives to him and got baptized?

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:07.930
Yes.

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:16.930
And since then, we've made many decisions to follow his directions which often come through his organization.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:25.930
Some changes were easy. Others were hard, especially when we did not fully understand the direction or agree with it.

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:31.930
Can you think of a time when you made a difficult change for Jehovah?

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:37.929
Did you later see how following his direction led to good results?

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:45.929
Your love for Jehovah and your deep devotion to him helped you to make wise decisions.

00:08:45.929 --> 00:08:48.929
What's the point?

00:08:48.929 --> 00:08:58.929
Doing what Jehovah asked us today not only brings good results now, but also prepares us for tomorrow.

00:08:58.929 --> 00:09:07.929
It ensures that when we are faced with a critical situation, we will naturally follow Jehovah's directions.

00:09:07.929 --> 00:09:10.929
Isn't this the best way to prepare for the future?

00:09:10.929 --> 00:09:17.929
For example, you may remember Sister Margaret Weirich who had to flee from wildfires.

00:09:17.929 --> 00:09:24.929
She learned from Jehovah's organization how important it is to obey those directing traffic.

00:09:24.929 --> 00:09:31.929
Although she wanted to drive a different way, she followed directions and was safe.

00:09:31.929 --> 00:09:35.929
Her godly devotion was evident.

00:09:35.929 --> 00:09:40.929
It's what prepared her for the future and ultimately saved her life.

00:09:40.929 --> 00:09:45.929
So Peter said, we must keep our senses.

00:09:45.929 --> 00:09:47.929
How?

00:09:47.929 --> 00:09:51.929
By cultivating qualities like godly devotion.

00:09:51.929 --> 00:09:59.460
This allows us to make good decisions and experience Jehovah's care.

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:04.460
What was the third point that Peter mentioned at 1 Peter 1 verse 13?

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:10.460
He tells us to set our hope on the undeserved kindness.

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.460
What was Peter trying to say?

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:21.460
How can these two elements, hope and undeserved kindness help us to prepare for tomorrow?

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:28.710
First, we have reminded of this stabilizing effect that hope can have on us.

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:33.710
Hope is compared to an anchor that keeps a ship secure during a storm.

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:46.179
When we become anxious about what we might have to endure tomorrow, persecution, disaster or health issues,

00:10:46.179 --> 00:10:50.179
don't we feel like we are in a storm?

00:10:50.179 --> 00:10:56.179
Without hope, we might easily lose our balance.

00:10:56.179 --> 00:11:08.179
Peter encourages us here to see beyond the uncertainties and focus on what is certain, solid and secure.

00:11:08.179 --> 00:11:15.179
Our hope, our view of future blessings stabilizes us.

00:11:15.179 --> 00:11:22.179
Did you notice that Peter made a connection between hope and undeserved kindness?

00:11:22.179 --> 00:11:31.179
The hope that we have is a gift from Jehovah, and Jesus' resurrection is the basis for our hope.

00:11:31.179 --> 00:11:38.179
The more we reflect on this, the stronger our gratitude and hope become.

00:11:38.179 --> 00:11:43.179
This grateful attitude influences our daily life.

00:11:43.179 --> 00:11:45.179
How so?

00:11:45.179 --> 00:11:53.179
For example, notice the mindset Peter mentioned at 1 Peter 2 verse 11.

00:11:53.179 --> 00:12:04.179
Beloved, I urge you as foreigners and temporary residents to keep abstaining from fleshly desires which rage war against you.

00:12:04.179 --> 00:12:12.179
Our daily choices show that we do not belong to this world or seek its protection.

00:12:12.179 --> 00:12:16.179
We are residents of God's kingdom.

00:12:16.179 --> 00:12:20.179
Peter reminds us to be different.

00:12:20.179 --> 00:12:26.179
For instance, we are different because of our view of material things.

00:12:26.179 --> 00:12:36.980
Materialism, a fleshly desire has affected people around us, and many would sacrifice everything for material things.

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:43.980
For example, many people are overly concerned about their financial future.

00:12:43.980 --> 00:13:02.480
While it's the course of wisdom to do some planning, excessive worry about material needs later in life may cause some to put undue pressure on children and other family members to pursue a secular career.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:09.480
This is common in some cultures, and it can affect us if we are not careful.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:23.889
We might feel pressured to imitate others, and this could even affect our friendship with Jehovah or what others in our family can do for him.

00:13:23.889 --> 00:13:32.889
In the following interview, notice how parents living in such a culture chose to prepare for the future.

00:13:32.889 --> 00:13:40.230
Hong Kong is an international city, and it is known for having high property prices.

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:56.539
I was a teacher, and as a teacher, I advise my students to study hard and choose the majors that can help them find a job with a higher income and a stable future.

00:13:57.539 --> 00:14:05.539
Before I learned the truth, I also hoped that our children could have a better future by getting a good job when they grew up.

00:14:05.539 --> 00:14:10.539
That way, they could also support us financially.

00:14:10.539 --> 00:14:18.539
Being Christian parents in the truth, we didn't want them to neglect their studies in school, but we also wanted them to know about the Bible.

00:14:18.539 --> 00:14:25.539
Therefore, we started studying the Bible with them and took them to meetings and helped them to preach to others.

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:33.860
Since they were young, I emphasized the blessings from God, and that we should always give things to him.

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:41.860
So when one of my sons told me, Dad, I want a pioneer. I was thrilled, and I said, You should do it.

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:49.860
But when I heard that he wanted to pioneer and work part-time, I worried about how that would affect our income.

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:55.860
However, we never had a problem. I really saw how Jehovah blessed us.

00:14:55.860 --> 00:15:02.860
The amount of money that we earned was more than enough, and I felt cared for and provided for by Jehovah.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:10.860
When my eldest son told me that he wanted to stop his current studies and start learning at construction trade, I was disappointed.

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:17.860
I thought that even students who didn't do well could do that job, and that type of work would be physically harder for him.

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:24.860
But he explained to us that being a construction worker would be useful now and forever in the New World.

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:28.860
I eventually respected his decision.

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:38.860
We taught our children to put Jehovah first, but when it came to putting it into practice, I needed to respect the decision made by my son.

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:46.779
In order to make it possible for our whole family to pioneer, we needed to simplify our lives.

00:15:47.779 --> 00:15:53.779
During family worship, we discussed ways to reduce expenses so that everyone in the family was on the same page.

00:15:53.779 --> 00:16:00.779
I noticed that we did not lack anything, and that the whole family could all share the burden of our expenses.

00:16:00.779 --> 00:16:07.889
Our children are now all grown up, and they willingly served Jehovah.

00:16:07.889 --> 00:16:14.889
I am so grateful to Jehovah because they have come to love him with their whole hearts.

00:16:15.889 --> 00:16:18.889
We are all so happy.

00:16:18.889 --> 00:16:25.889
I am thankful to Jehovah every time I see the smiling faces of my family.

00:16:25.889 --> 00:16:30.889
I have clearly felt that Jehovah always takes care of his servants.

00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:35.889
Like it says, at Matthew, chapter 6, verse 33,

00:16:35.889 --> 00:16:42.889
If we keep seeking first God's kingdom and His righteousness, Jehovah will take care of us.

00:16:42.889 --> 00:16:50.889
And if our prayers are according to God's will and we try our best, He will undoubtedly bless our efforts.

00:16:50.889 --> 00:16:55.889
Therefore, I have strong faith and hope for our future ahead.

00:16:55.889 --> 00:17:09.769
Being different can be challenging, but wasn't it encouraging to see how this couple resisted cultural expectations and pressure?

00:17:09.769 --> 00:17:20.369
Instead, they agreed with their children's desire to pursue goals in Jehovah's service, and they supported them.

00:17:20.369 --> 00:17:26.369
Strengthening our friendship with Jehovah is the best preparation for tomorrow.

00:17:26.369 --> 00:17:36.369
And whether Jehovah ultimately uses children to care for their parents or provides help in another way,

00:17:36.369 --> 00:17:41.369
Jehovah will stick to his promise to care for us.

00:17:41.369 --> 00:17:54.349
To be fully equipped for tomorrow, we set our hope with gratitude on our God, the God we trust.

00:17:54.349 --> 00:18:02.349
In this discussion, did you find that you are already doing these things? Likely so.

00:18:02.349 --> 00:18:13.349
Therefore, we do not have any reason to be overly anxious or fearful about future trials or other uncertainties.

00:18:13.349 --> 00:18:25.420
We face the future with confidence because we are fully equipped for tomorrow.

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:29.420
We are also fully equipped for the ministry.

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:34.420
We have the tools and training we need to reach all kinds of people.

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:38.420
And those who are not religious.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:43.420
How can we preach to people like that more effectively?

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:49.420
We'll learn in this episode of Iron Sharpen's Iron.

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:52.420
Hello, I am Akihiro.

00:18:52.420 --> 00:19:04.769
And this is Iron Sharpen's Iron.

00:19:04.769 --> 00:19:11.769
Have you ever been in the ministry and just as you're starting a conversation, the individual stops you and says,

00:19:11.769 --> 00:19:13.769
I'm not religious.

00:19:13.769 --> 00:19:15.769
How did you react?

00:19:15.769 --> 00:19:17.769
Did you freeze up?

00:19:17.769 --> 00:19:19.769
I'm sure of what to say.

00:19:19.769 --> 00:19:22.769
I know it's happened to me.

00:19:22.769 --> 00:19:33.769
In this episode of Iron Sharpen's Iron, we're going to discuss three tips to help us reach the hearts of non-religious people.

00:19:33.769 --> 00:19:40.769
But what comes to your mind when you hear the word non-religious?

00:19:40.769 --> 00:19:44.769
You might assume this means the person doesn't believe in God.

00:19:44.769 --> 00:19:54.769
But the truth is that although the person may not belong to an organized religion, they might very well have a belief in God or in a higher power.

00:19:54.769 --> 00:19:59.769
So we don't want to make assumptions.

00:19:59.769 --> 00:20:04.769
Lesson 9 of our brochure, Love People Make Disciples says,

00:20:04.769 --> 00:20:10.769
Empathy moves us to care about people, not just about our message.

00:20:10.769 --> 00:20:17.769
So let's focus on letting the person express themselves and then empathizing with their situation.

00:20:17.769 --> 00:20:26.170
Let's talk about three tips we can use to do that with non-religious people.

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:30.170
1. Be Positive

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:34.170
2. Listen with Understanding

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:39.170
3. Share information that addresses their needs

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:44.170
Now, let's see how we can apply these tips.

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:52.170
You know, with so many crazy things happening in the world right now, a lot of people feel like world peace is an impossible dream.

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:55.170
What's your opinion?

00:20:55.170 --> 00:21:01.769
If this is about religion, I'm not interested.

00:21:01.769 --> 00:21:05.769
Everyone is free to believe what he wants.

00:21:05.769 --> 00:21:11.769
What is important is not a bunch of rules and rituals.

00:21:11.769 --> 00:21:16.769
But believing in God from our heart, that's my opinion.

00:21:16.769 --> 00:21:19.769
Hmm, I agree.

00:21:19.769 --> 00:21:23.769
Believing in God from our heart is very important.

00:21:23.769 --> 00:21:30.769
If you don't mind, may I ask you why you're not interested in religion?

00:21:30.769 --> 00:21:35.269
I used to belong to a religion.

00:21:35.269 --> 00:21:41.269
In the hypocrisy, I saw it just completely turned me off.

00:21:41.269 --> 00:21:46.269
Hmm, I'm so sorry you experienced that.

00:21:46.269 --> 00:21:53.000
I can understand why you feel the way you do.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:22:01.000
If religion cannot be of much help, what do you turn to for reliable guidance during these tough times?

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:14.329
Did you see how well our sisters put our first two tips into practice?

00:22:14.329 --> 00:22:18.329
Our sisters maintained a positive spirit.

00:22:18.329 --> 00:22:24.329
Even after the householder told them, he wasn't interested in religion.

00:22:24.329 --> 00:22:33.329
This gave the householder the opportunity to speak and allowed our sisters to apply our second tip, listen with understanding.

00:22:33.329 --> 00:22:37.329
They listened as the man expressed himself.

00:22:37.329 --> 00:22:45.329
That allowed them to understand where he was coming from and then to respond empathetically and keep the conversation going.

00:22:45.329 --> 00:22:51.329
But what if you meet someone who doesn't believe in God at all?

00:22:51.329 --> 00:22:53.329
Let's take a look.

00:22:53.329 --> 00:22:59.079
Hmm, it's a beautiful season isn't it?

00:22:59.079 --> 00:23:01.079
I love the lavender.

00:23:01.079 --> 00:23:03.079
So beautiful.

00:23:03.079 --> 00:23:09.079
Oh, yeah, I love it too. The color is lovely isn't it?

00:23:09.079 --> 00:23:12.079
Hmm, it is.

00:23:12.079 --> 00:23:20.079
Oh, you know, to me flowers are like an amazing gift from God.

00:23:20.079 --> 00:23:24.079
Have you ever wondered if there is a God?

00:23:24.079 --> 00:23:28.079
Hmm, a God?

00:23:28.079 --> 00:23:32.079
Well, it would be nice if there were.

00:23:32.079 --> 00:23:36.079
But I don't believe in God.

00:23:36.079 --> 00:23:40.079
Hmm, you know, many feel the same way you do.

00:23:40.079 --> 00:23:49.079
If you don't mind me asking, have you ever wondered why some people do believe in God?

00:23:49.079 --> 00:23:52.079
Hmm, honestly, I have.

00:23:52.079 --> 00:24:01.500
But I haven't found a reasonable answer.

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:10.500
Once again, our sister maintained a positive spirit and wasn't put off by the woman stating that she doesn't believe in God.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:18.500
Instead, she sought further understanding by asking a simple yet genuine question.

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:23.500
Have you ever wondered why some people do believe in God?

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:30.500
Did you see how the woman relaxed when she realized that the sister was actually interested in understanding her?

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:35.500
And was willing to continue the conversation?

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:43.500
Now, if the person is willing to talk and the opportunity arises, we can apply our third tip.

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:47.500
Share information that addresses their needs.

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:54.500
With our last householder, what do we have in our library of publications that we could share with her?

00:24:54.500 --> 00:25:02.099
We could share one of the brochures in our teaching toolbox that addresses creation.

00:25:02.099 --> 00:25:10.099
Or if they are available in your language, a video from the series, was it designed?

00:25:10.099 --> 00:25:14.099
Or viewpoints on the origin of life?

00:25:14.099 --> 00:25:21.099
So, let's make it our goal to be more familiar with all the tools Jehovah has given us.

00:25:21.099 --> 00:25:29.700
Every year, there are non-religious people who become Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:36.700
So, we have reason to be positive when we speak to those not interested in religion.

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:48.069
And as we listen with understanding, and when appropriate, share information that addresses their needs.

00:25:49.069 --> 00:25:56.579
We will be doing our best to reach the hearts of non-religious people.

00:25:56.579 --> 00:26:07.890
These tips have helped me in my ministry, and as iron sharpens iron, I hope they help you too.

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:16.890
Never underestimate how the hearts of our neighbors can be moved when we listen to them with empathy and show we really care.

00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:25.890
Even those who seem unlikely to listen to our message can be touched by God's word and the genuine love we show.

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:31.890
That's exactly what happened to a young man named Lucas Lacra. Here is his story.

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:53.910
I was a bully. I used to steal from others. And I was very, very angry.

00:26:53.910 --> 00:27:00.910
Inside, I had feelings of taking revenge. I wanted revenge.

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:11.849
I spent my childhood in a small city of India. My family was very poor.

00:27:11.849 --> 00:27:17.849
My parents both had the habit of drinking. Often they had fights at home.

00:27:17.849 --> 00:27:24.849
My father would beat my mother with wood. And sometimes, he would beat us too.

00:27:25.849 --> 00:27:37.849
So me and my siblings, we would run and hide to the outside toilets and we would wait there until the shouting and fighting would stop.

00:27:37.849 --> 00:27:49.359
One day, I saw my father. He was full drunk. I was very small.

00:27:49.359 --> 00:27:59.700
Maybe six years old and I was playing near the house. My uncle came to the house screaming at my father.

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:05.700
I ran to see what was happening. But there was nothing I could do.

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:10.700
When in front of my own eyes, my father was murdered.

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:22.799
Later, I was taken away from my mother to work as a servant.

00:28:25.079 --> 00:28:32.079
They treated me terribly. With punches and kicks, they even strangled me once.

00:28:32.079 --> 00:28:39.029
I missed my mother. I felt so alone.

00:28:39.029 --> 00:28:46.029
My mother was suffering from cancer. I asked them many times that I want to go and see my mother.

00:28:46.029 --> 00:28:53.029
But they wouldn't let me go. I started crying. I said, I want to go home.

00:28:53.029 --> 00:29:03.029
But they said, going now will be of no use because your mother has already been dead for four days.

00:29:03.029 --> 00:29:19.069
I cried a lot. I could not see my mother one last time. All of this made me feel so angry inside.

00:29:19.069 --> 00:29:27.480
I was always fighting, bullying and stealing. Eventually, I was thrown out of the house.

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:34.480
This time, a relative took me in. I noticed her daughter would go somewhere every Sunday.

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:42.480
And this made me very curious. So I asked her where she would go and she said to Bible meetings.

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:50.269
Her daughter also told me that a couple would come every Friday to study the Bible with her.

00:29:50.269 --> 00:30:00.750
She invited me to join her if I wanted. So I decided to sit in on her study.

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:12.440
I was impressed with the brothers studying with her. They were so kind. They cared a lot and showed love.

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:20.299
That was not seen in churches. On one occasion, I found myself running again.

00:30:20.299 --> 00:30:27.279
But this time, I was running to the Kingdom Hall to see my new family.

00:30:27.279 --> 00:30:32.279
It was about 10 kilometers away. But I had no money to go by vehicle.

00:30:32.279 --> 00:30:37.279
So instead, I went by foot. But every step was worth it.

00:30:37.279 --> 00:30:43.279
Because at meeting, I really felt Jehovah's love through the brothers and sisters.

00:30:43.279 --> 00:30:52.819
As my study slowly progressed, I began to realize I'm not an orphan.

00:30:52.819 --> 00:31:07.029
Jehovah is with me. He is my father. Eventually, I was able to throw all my burdens on my father, Jehovah.

00:31:07.029 --> 00:31:14.029
And I started to have peace of mind. So I dedicated my life to Jehovah.

00:31:14.029 --> 00:31:24.029
On December 26, 1998, I was baptized. After my baptism, I wanted to give Jehovah my best.

00:31:24.029 --> 00:31:31.029
Today, me and my wife, Julian, we are so happy to be in full-time service together.

00:31:31.029 --> 00:31:36.029
And thanks to Jehovah, we have enjoyed a variety of assignments as a couple.

00:31:36.029 --> 00:31:48.089
My past cannot be erased. Neither can I stop these memories from coming into my mind.

00:31:48.089 --> 00:31:54.589
But Jehovah has completely changed my life.

00:31:54.589 --> 00:32:02.319
I no longer feel anger or the need for revenge anymore.

00:32:02.319 --> 00:32:08.319
So there is no need to feel orphaned. Give yourselves completely to the hands of Jehovah.

00:32:08.319 --> 00:32:13.319
He's your father. He will take care of you. He will never leave you.

00:32:13.319 --> 00:32:22.369
Brother Lacra's story shows how learning the truth really is life-changing.

00:32:22.369 --> 00:32:29.369
Even feelings of intense anger and revenge can give way to real peace of mind.

00:32:29.369 --> 00:32:39.369
Like Lucas, all of us appreciate the way Jehovah teaches us to deal with difficulties in life, including in our family life.

00:32:39.369 --> 00:32:48.369
If you are married, have you ever found yourself in a situation where you and your maid just don't see things the same way?

00:32:48.369 --> 00:32:56.369
If so, you're not alone. And you will appreciate the suggestions in this episode of For A Happy Marriage.

00:32:56.369 --> 00:33:26.859
You found that special someone. You can't believe how compatible you are.

00:33:26.859 --> 00:33:37.529
Yet you soon discover that compatible does not mean identical.

00:33:37.529 --> 00:33:43.529
The Bible describes a husband and wife as complements, not competitors.

00:33:43.529 --> 00:33:47.529
A complement completes what another may lack.

00:33:47.529 --> 00:33:51.529
This means your differences can strengthen your marriage.

00:33:51.529 --> 00:34:16.460
Still, with two imperfect people, disagreements will happen, but they don't have to become arguments.

00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:31.150
If the two of you don't see a matter in the same way, for example, how to manage money, what should you do?

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:37.559
Should you insist until you get your way?

00:34:37.559 --> 00:35:12.639
Say nothing at all. There is a better way to work through the occasional difference before it becomes a conflict.

00:35:12.639 --> 00:35:22.639
A Bible Principal states, let each one keep seeking, not his own advantage, but that of the other person.

00:35:22.639 --> 00:35:31.639
You may need to set aside your cherished point of view and really try to see the value of your maid's perspective.

00:35:31.639 --> 00:35:42.659
Remember, seek his or her advantage, not your own. Take each issue one at a time.

00:35:42.659 --> 00:35:47.659
You may be able to resolve most of your differences and meet in the middle.

00:35:47.659 --> 00:35:57.400
With practice, you will learn to tackle your disagreements, not each other.

00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:03.400
This is a skill you will work at for a lifetime, since we all change as we age.

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:11.030
For example, what if your viewpoints differ on how to care for aging parents?

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:43.380
Start with your common ground.

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:52.380
In addition to the financial cost, consider the cost to your time, health and relationship with each other and with God.

00:36:52.380 --> 00:37:00.570
Recognise the merits of your spouse's viewpoint.

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:10.570
And even if your differences cannot be solved by a mutual compromise, conceding and supporting will be a win for your friendship.

00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:17.570
You might also agree to discuss the question again at a later date or a circumstances change.

00:37:17.570 --> 00:37:24.360
Even if you don't always agree, you can still work as a team.

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:35.610
Different viewpoints broaden your horizons, add colour to your marriage, and in the end draw you closer to one another.

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:43.860
Here are three questions to discuss that can help you handle situations in your marriage where viewpoints differ.

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:49.860
If it's convenient, pause this video now and really talk.

00:37:49.860 --> 00:38:02.179
What practical advice for handling difficulties in ways that can make your marriage stronger and happier?

00:38:02.179 --> 00:38:09.179
Whether married or single, we all encounter times when someone we know is experiencing serious illness or

00:38:09.179 --> 00:38:12.179
emotional distress.

00:38:12.179 --> 00:38:18.179
Do you feel a deep desire to provide them with relief and support?

00:38:18.179 --> 00:38:27.179
In this morning's Worship program, Brother Harold Corcoran highlights the importance of consoling others.

00:38:27.179 --> 00:38:40.179
Our text today highlights the importance of consoling which basically conveys the idea to soothe and courage uplift fortify.

00:38:40.179 --> 00:38:54.179
It also encourages us to support the weak and the basic meaning of that expression support the weak is to hold fast to, cleave to the person that's needing assistance.

00:38:54.179 --> 00:38:58.179
By doing that, we are certainly imitating Jehovah, aren't we?

00:38:58.179 --> 00:39:05.179
At Psalm 3418, it says, Jehovah is close to the broken hearted. He's right there.

00:39:05.179 --> 00:39:12.179
He saves those who are crushed in spirit. He lifts up those who are depressed.

00:39:12.179 --> 00:39:21.179
Well, what can help us to imitate Jehovah to the best of our ability and consoling, supporting and doing all that with patience?

00:39:21.179 --> 00:39:28.179
Well, one thing that will certainly help is the relationship between the one giving the assistance and the one receiving it.

00:39:28.179 --> 00:39:32.179
If there's friendship there, it makes a big difference.

00:39:32.179 --> 00:39:39.179
Because the one receiving the help feels comfortable, they may have something very embarrassing or sensitive to talk about,

00:39:39.179 --> 00:39:44.179
and doing so with a true trusted friend makes it a lot easier.

00:39:45.179 --> 00:39:54.179
And the one rendering the assistance, if he's a friend, then it doesn't come across like he's interrogating or he's investigating something.

00:39:54.179 --> 00:39:58.179
But rather, he's showing genuine interest.

00:39:58.179 --> 00:40:06.500
Well, building up an understanding of the background of each other certainly helps, doesn't it? That's what friends do.

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:10.500
We understand a lot about that person, don't we?

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:19.500
For example, what could build up our desire to be consoling, to be supportive and to do it with patience?

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:28.500
The background. Here are just a few examples of background that can motivate us to do just what our text says today.

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:33.500
Here they are. Did they grow up in a dysfunctional family?

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:43.739
Was one of their parents an alcoholic? Did the mother or father abandon them when they were young?

00:40:43.739 --> 00:40:51.739
Did a beloved family member turn against the truth and is now a bitter opposer? There could be many other reasons.

00:40:51.739 --> 00:41:03.739
But such background gives us not only the desire to help with the willingness and the ability to do it in a way that will be most helpful.

00:41:03.739 --> 00:41:13.739
The one thing we have to keep in mind about the variety of things that require assistance is based on something that said in Romans chapter 8 and verse 22.

00:41:13.739 --> 00:41:16.739
And we invite you to open your Bibles there.

00:41:16.739 --> 00:41:20.739
Romans chapter 8 and verse 22.

00:41:20.739 --> 00:41:27.739
And this will help us to appreciate that regardless of the problem, there is a common reason for it.

00:41:27.739 --> 00:41:36.739
Romans 8, 22 Paul is talking about the bad effects that have come from the Adam's sin. And here's what he says.

00:41:36.739 --> 00:41:46.739
For we know that all creation keeps on groaning together and being in pain together until now.

00:41:46.739 --> 00:41:58.739
That pain and groaning as descendants of Adam's can manifest itself in physical ailments like heart trouble, diabetes, cancer or others.

00:41:58.739 --> 00:42:09.739
But it's not limited to physical ailment. Emotional and mental issues also arise because of being descendants of Adam.

00:42:09.739 --> 00:42:24.739
And so just as we had never looked down or condemned someone who had a physical ailment, we would never want to do that with something that's going through an emotional issue such as depression or another mental illness.

00:42:24.739 --> 00:42:35.739
And one of the things that we want to do for those regardless of what their needs may be is to use the scriptures and to be a good shepherd.

00:42:35.739 --> 00:42:44.739
And sisters can help other sisters, friends can help friends elders, of course, have that responsibility to help everyone too.

00:42:44.739 --> 00:42:48.739
But now there's something that we need to keep in mind when we're trying to help.

00:42:48.739 --> 00:42:53.739
And it's recorded for us in Proverbs chapter 12 and verse 18.

00:42:53.739 --> 00:42:56.739
And we invite you to turn there. Proverbs 12, 18.

00:42:56.739 --> 00:43:01.739
We want to help. We want to console. We do not want to hurt.

00:43:01.739 --> 00:43:03.739
Proverbs 12, 18.

00:43:03.739 --> 00:43:12.739
Foughtless speech is like the stabs of a sword, but the tongue of the wise is a healing.

00:43:12.739 --> 00:43:20.739
So our desire is to console, to support, to uplift, to cheer up, not to make them at or worse.

00:43:20.739 --> 00:43:24.739
So thoughtful speech is a key.

00:43:25.739 --> 00:43:30.739
Now just illustrate how much pain can be caused if that's not done.

00:43:30.739 --> 00:43:38.739
Notice the expressions of one of our Christian sisters who went through a period of depression. She said this.

00:43:38.739 --> 00:43:43.739
One lesson I'll never forget. I learned empathy.

00:43:43.739 --> 00:43:49.739
Before, I used to think that all you had to do was to pump yourself up and get going.

00:43:49.739 --> 00:43:54.739
So I never had much fellow feeling for others who were sick.

00:43:54.739 --> 00:44:03.739
Now I know. When some of the friends told me to snap out of it, there wasn't anything that I wanted to do more.

00:44:03.739 --> 00:44:07.739
But at that point, I had no control.

00:44:07.739 --> 00:44:10.739
Their comments really hurt.

00:44:10.739 --> 00:44:20.739
Well, how sad. In an effort to help, we unintentionally can inflict more pain by thoughtless speech.

00:44:20.739 --> 00:44:28.739
What can help us to prevent thoughtless speech? Well, we can consider these questions based on Bible principles.

00:44:28.739 --> 00:44:35.739
Is what I'm about to say true, kind, necessary?

00:44:35.739 --> 00:44:39.739
How would I feel if someone said that to me?

00:44:39.739 --> 00:44:42.739
Will it show respect?

00:44:42.739 --> 00:44:47.280
Is this the right setting to even bring it up at all?

00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:54.280
Thinking before we speak can do a lot to do healing rather than to inflict more pain.

00:44:54.280 --> 00:45:00.280
And in this connection and helping to press ones, patience is required.

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:08.280
Perhaps you've experienced this. Someone that's suppressed may pour out their feelings with great feeling and intensity.

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:11.280
We listen. We offer encouragement.

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:20.280
And then a short time later, they're back with the same intense feelings and concerns as if it had never been discussed before.

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:26.280
Patients is required to keep consoling and to keep supporting.

00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:32.280
In doing so, we would imitate Jehovah at limitations 32 and 23.

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:35.280
The Bible says about Jehovah.

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:40.280
It is because of Jehovah's loyal love that we have not come to our finish.

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:44.280
For his mercies never end.

00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:50.280
They are new each morning. Your faithfulness is abundant.

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:54.280
Jehovah gives us help every day.

00:45:54.280 --> 00:46:04.280
And though it's not easy, we want to be just as patient and just as consoling and just as helpful as Jehovah.

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:15.280
Well, after listening and offering thoughtful, scriptural advice, the scriptures are powerful, but sometimes something more than that is needed for someone who's depressed.

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:17.280
Why do we say that?

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:20.280
Luke 531, Jesus said this.

00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:29.280
Those who are healthy do not need a physician, but those who are ill do.

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:36.280
Depression may not be because of some temporary disappointment or temporary feeling of low or discouragement.

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:39.280
It might be more clinical.

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:45.280
It might have been inherited as part of a family trait or weakness.

00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:51.280
And scriptures alone, although very valuable, will not be all the help they need.

00:46:51.280 --> 00:47:01.280
In some cases, seeking medical attention is the course of wisdom and perhaps in some cases even medication.

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:05.280
Well, if a person is in that situation, what should they do?

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:08.280
They've been helped, but they're still needing more help.

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:19.280
Well, with humility and modesty, recognizing their limitations, they will seek the help they need, not only spiritually, but medically.

00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:28.559
Well, there's one thing about it, living in these last days, all of us are going to go periods of time where we need encouragement.

00:47:28.559 --> 00:47:35.559
In fact, we may be encouraging somebody today, and next week, we need it.

00:47:35.559 --> 00:47:41.559
That's why the Apostle Paul and process only in chapter 5 and verse 11 said,

00:47:41.559 --> 00:47:51.559
keep encouraging one another and building one another up just as, in fact, you are doing.

00:47:51.559 --> 00:48:00.559
And if we do that, then we can help each of us endure through these last days to the point where, as foretold Isaiah,

00:48:00.559 --> 00:48:07.559
no one will say, I'm sick, either spiritually, mentally, emotionally or physically.

00:48:07.559 --> 00:48:21.559
So in line with today's text, let us keep what we're doing, speak consolingly to those who are depressed, support the week, be patient toward all.

00:48:21.559 --> 00:48:31.559
What a blessing it is to have spiritual brothers and sisters to keep encouraging and building one another up during these last days.

00:48:31.559 --> 00:48:56.190
This month's music video titled, every minute, is about just that.

00:50:25.619 --> 00:52:43.280
In this program, we've learned about many of the things we can do to prepare our spiritual go back.

00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:47.280
This will help us to be fully equipped for the future.

00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:57.230
We can preach zealously to people of all sorts, cultivate qualities that bring peace to our family life,

00:52:57.230 --> 00:53:04.480
and build our trust in Jehovah by reflecting on the blessing he's given us.

00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:08.480
One of those blessings is our worldwide brotherhood.

00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:14.480
Every month, we get to meet another part of that brotherhood through our video postcard.

00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:21.480
And this month, we are going to the western edge of Europe, to the Azores Archipelago.

00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:31.480
The Azores are a chain of nine volcanic islands, about 1,600 kilometers or 1,000 miles west of Portugal.

00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:40.480
Here, vineyards and plantations meet steep, emerald peaks, crater lakes and hot springs.

00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:46.480
Steemen volcanic gases escape from the earth through vents called fumaroles.

00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:55.480
On the island of Sao Miguel, this brother prepares a local dish in a fumarole, letting it cook for up to seven hours.

00:53:55.480 --> 00:54:07.480
Thanks to the subtropical climate, the Azores produce an abundance of pineapples, oranges, bananas and tea.

00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:14.480
Our brothers enjoy making beautiful crafts from local resources, such as fish scales.

00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:22.480
And they enjoy preparing regional foods, like these bolo lef du cakes, which can be found at any meal.

00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:32.889
The first seeds of truth were planted here in the early 20th century by Azoreans who learned the truth in the United States,

00:54:32.889 --> 00:54:37.889
and shared what they learned with relatives and friends back home.

00:54:37.889 --> 00:54:46.889
Despite decades of church-led opposition, publishers have always found cheap-like ones.

00:54:46.889 --> 00:54:53.889
Today, there are more than 800 publishers in 15 congregations in the Azores.

00:54:53.889 --> 00:54:57.889
Our brothers conduct more than 500 Bible studies.

00:54:57.889 --> 00:55:02.889
Memorial attendance was more than twice the number of witnesses here.

00:55:02.889 --> 00:55:09.889
The good news is preached in both Portuguese and Portuguese sign language.

00:55:09.889 --> 00:55:15.889
This is the Santa Cruz-deche Flores congregation. It has 17 publishers.

00:55:15.889 --> 00:55:20.889
Their territory includes the islands of Flores and Corvo.

00:55:20.889 --> 00:55:29.889
From the Azores, our brothers and sisters in the Santa Cruz-deche Flores congregation sent you their warm love and greetings.

00:55:29.889 --> 00:55:39.889
And we send our love to all of you as well. From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.
