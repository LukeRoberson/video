00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:12.279
At Luke chapter 6 and verse 40, Jesus said a student is not above his teacher, but everyone

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:18.679
who is perfectly instructed will be like his teacher.

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:22.519
Now what comes to your mind when you think about this verse?

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:28.079
Maybe you tend to think of it in terms of when you conduct a Bible study with someone.

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:33.520
Or you might think about it when you go to a program like Gilead and you're instructed

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.200
there.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:46.240
But in reality, we are all teachers every day in the classroom of Christian living.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:53.119
If we have responsibilities, if we enjoy certain privileges, our brothers and sisters

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:56.359
will watch us.

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:06.709
And those who work closely with us will learn from us and they will become like us.

00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:10.109
Take the example of the Apostle Paul.

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:13.430
Now we know Paul was an outstanding teacher.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.909
Can you imagine under inspiration he had the privilege to write 14 books of the Christian

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.069
Greek scriptures?

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:28.189
Yet that was not the only way that the Apostle Paul taught others.

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:33.750
His example in Christian living was very powerful.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.069
Now what could people learn from the example of Paul?

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:39.510
Let's consider some examples.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:48.420
Let's go first to 1 Thessalonians chapter 2, 1 Thessalonians chapter 2, and let's

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.219
look at verse 7.

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:57.859
On the contrary, we became gentle in your midst as when a nursing mother tenderly cares for

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:59.939
her own children.

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.920
So having tender affection for you, we were determined to impart to you not only the good

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:17.099
news of God, but also our very selves because you became so beloved to us.

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.099
Paul worked hard for the brothers.

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.900
He was kind, he was gentle with them.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.780
He was willing to give not just the message of the truth, but as he says in verse 8, our

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:37.780
very selves and brothers, that was the truth.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:44.219
Paul said he was willing to do all things for the sake of the good news and just consider

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:46.180
some of the things that he did.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.580
Let's go to 2 Corinthians chapter 11 and just remind ourselves of some of the things

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.180
Paul went through.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:01.500
2 Corinthians 11 verse 23, Paul says, are they ministers of Christ?

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.219
I reply like a man, man.

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:05.419
I am more outstandingly one.

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:11.620
I have done more work, been imprisoned more often, suffered countless beatings and experienced

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.819
many near deaths.

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.020
Five times I received 40 strokes, less one from the Jews.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:24.900
Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I experienced shipwreck,

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:33.180
a night and a day I have spent in the open sea and the list just goes on.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:40.099
What was, what could these ones who worked with Paul learn from him?

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:48.219
In other words, how did Paul's powerful example of love for God, of endurance, of hard work

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:54.460
and true unselfishness affect those around him?

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.219
Well consider Timothy who worked so closely with Paul.

00:03:58.219 --> 00:03:59.939
What did Paul say about him?

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:09.930
Let's go to Philippians chapter 2, Philippians chapter 2 and verse 20.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:18.810
Paul said, for I have no one else of a disposition like his who will genuinely care for your concerns,

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.250
for all the others are seeking their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:30.610
But you know the proof he gave of himself that like a child with a father, he slaved with

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.410
me to advance the good news.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.769
Well now here's a question.

00:04:36.769 --> 00:04:39.689
Why was Timothy that way?

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.410
Why was Timothy so unselfish?

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.730
Why did he work so hard for other people?

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:56.930
Well no doubt he was perfectly instructed, not just by the words, but by the example of Paul.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.170
Well the same thing could be true of Priscilla and Aquila.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:05.730
Paul said about them that they had risked their necks for him.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.009
Well where did they learn that from?

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:13.610
You see we could go on with other examples of other close associates of Paul, but what

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.889
is the point?

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:24.329
Paul's example in Christian living instructed those around him, they became like Paul.

00:05:24.329 --> 00:05:31.209
Now why is that important to you who are graduating today from the Watchtower Bible School of

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:32.209
Gilead?

00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:38.970
Well very soon you're going to be graduates and your mandate is to go forth.

00:05:39.329 --> 00:05:45.170
And strengthen and stabilize the field and branch territory.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.730
But now that's a big long term isn't it?

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.730
What is the field and branch territory?

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:59.050
It's people, it's people, spiritual men and women who want to be learned, who want to

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:05.730
learn, who want to be trained, who want to reach the spiritual goals that they've set

00:06:05.769 --> 00:06:11.449
for themselves, and who want to grow to Christian maturity.

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:19.930
And because you are a Gilead graduate, they will watch you, they will listen to you,

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:25.050
and they will be instructed by your example.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:30.810
When I went to serve many years ago where the need was great on the island of Newfoundland,

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:37.290
we were so blessed to have in our congregation a graduate of the seventh class of Gilead,

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.410
brother Fred Weins.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:45.529
Brother Weins was an anointed brother who was baptized in 1928.

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:52.930
Now I'll be honest with you, I don't remember even one talk that Fred Weins gave.

00:06:52.930 --> 00:07:00.689
But his warmth, his sense of humor, his zeal for the ministry and his love for people,

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:06.250
the example that he set is truly unforgettable.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:11.129
Fred talked to everyone, and I mean everyone in the ministry.

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:16.329
One time we were out in the service, we pulled into the gas station, as soon as we stopped

00:07:16.329 --> 00:07:22.250
the car, Fred jumped out, and when we were ready to leave, we looked around to try to find

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.250
Fred.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:28.170
Wasn't in the store, wasn't in the bathroom, he was nowhere to be seen.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:34.129
Finally we thought we'd check the other cars, well that's exactly where Fred was.

00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:38.930
Fred had knocked on the window and gotten in the car and started to preach to all the

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:42.170
people in that car.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:50.769
Fred has now gone on to his reward, but his example of warmth, kindness, zeal, and love

00:07:50.769 --> 00:07:58.129
for people continue to teach me and many others who knew him well right down to this day.

00:07:58.769 --> 00:08:03.410
So here is the question that rests before you.

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:08.209
What will you teach others by your example?

00:08:08.209 --> 00:08:10.370
Be like Paul.

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:14.089
Love your brothers and sisters right from your heart.

00:08:14.089 --> 00:08:21.930
Through your example, create an atmosphere of warmth and love like a greenhouse where

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:26.410
young plants can blossom and grow.

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:33.289
Your fine example can warm up a congregation, a circuit, a Bethel department, perhaps even

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:44.409
a branch office, never allow yourself to be a cold executive who creates an atmosphere

00:08:44.409 --> 00:08:54.409
like a freezer, because those little plants will shrivel up and they will stop growing

00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:56.090
in that environment.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:01.690
Be willing to impart not just the many wonderful truths of God's word that you learned at

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:06.730
Gilead, but your own heart and your own soul.

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:14.730
And then because those beautiful spiritual people you work with will be properly instructed.

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.490
What will they be like?

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:21.330
They will be just like you.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:25.889
And may the blessing of our marvelous God, Jehovah, go with you wherever you go.
