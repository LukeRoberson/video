00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:05.299
A second Corinthians 6 verse 13 says,

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:13.300
it's good for us to open our hearts wide or widen out in our affections for our brothers and sisters.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.300
We really need one another, especially in these difficult times.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:24.300
In no way do we want our love for our brothers to be restricted somehow.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.300
There are many ways that we can display this aspect of our Christian personality.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.299
One way is by assisting those in our congregations who perhaps are housebound.

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:48.299
The following experiences will highlight how being shown loving kindness has proven to some that although they are isolated, they are not forgotten.

00:00:48.299 --> 00:01:22.010
My friends and I decided to go swimming at a lake.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:29.010
But when I dove in, I ended up hitting my head at the bottom of the lake.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:41.959
I hurt my fourth and fifth vertebra and ended up becoming tetraplegic.

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:51.959
In July 1989, I suffered a stroke and my life changed completely.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.400
I was a normal person, but with this stroke, it came its after effect.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.400
I can't get around without help.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:11.400
In 2009, my dad started to notice muscle weakness.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:20.400
After going to a few orthopedic doctors, because he thought it might be an orthopedic issue like a back problem or not walking correctly.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.400
He was finally referred to a neurologist.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:34.400
After two long years researching his illness, the neurologist diagnosed him with amiotrophic lateral sclerosis, ALS.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:53.370
I found out about the diagnosis along with the rest of my family and it was devastating to learn that his illness is progressive, degenerative and ultimately fatal.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.370
Jehovah doesn't forget what we do for him.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:07.770
And I feel that Jehovah is always present in my life.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.770
Right now, I have some privileges in the congregation.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:20.770
I'm a ministerial servant and I've received a few assignments.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:32.770
My brothers are really encouraged by Fernando because even though he faces some difficulties, he makes an effort to attend the meetings and give talks.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:41.770
A brother made his stand for Fernando's computer so that even lying in his bed, he can access JW.org.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.770
He also do his research in various other jobs to fill his time.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:52.770
A tablet holder was also made for him to use with his wheelchair.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.770
I feel really grateful for the brother's help.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:02.770
They're always interested in knowing how I am.

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.770
They're always trying to help me when I need it.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:14.770
They don't just say they'll help but they try to live up to their promises.

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:24.769
We start to feel Jehovah's presence in his help and it's really worth having this help.

00:04:24.769 --> 00:04:31.769
If the various challenges and problems Marley faces in her life, she has all the reasons in the world to feel sorry for herself, but she doesn't.

00:04:31.769 --> 00:04:36.769
She helps others in a practical way, especially the young ones.

00:04:37.769 --> 00:04:44.769
I didn't know how to do telephone witnessing, I'd never done it before, but Marley taught me how to witness over the phone.

00:04:44.769 --> 00:04:49.769
She was able to help me learn a new type of witnessing.

00:04:49.769 --> 00:04:55.769
It was very difficult for me to attend the meetings.

00:04:55.769 --> 00:05:05.769
So the congregation set up an internet connection and it's been a gift from Jehovah.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.980
So I'm able to watch the meetings on the computer.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.980
Jehovah is extremely good. He really cares for us.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.980
He is the God of all comfort.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:27.980
And in all this time, Jehovah has never stopped helping my family.

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.790
Rather Miru is still an act of publisher in the congregation.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.790
He continues to witness to his nurses.

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.790
How does he do it?

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:49.790
Every month his wife receives the publications, shows him all the articles, and then, during the week, he talks to the nurses.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.790
To be honest, he listens to their problems.

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.790
So how does he manage to witness to them?

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:00.790
He blinks at his wife, and he remembers the subject that he had discussed with the nurse.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:05.790
And he blinks to point out which publication should be given to the nurse.

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:11.790
At the end of the month, his wife writes down how much time was spent talking and which publication was left.

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:15.790
We've also made arrangements to record the meetings and take them to Miru.

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:28.019
Jehovah gives us strength by means of our brothers and sisters, by means of friends who know about our struggles.

00:06:30.019 --> 00:06:37.019
The brothers in the congregation got together and did small repair jobs around the house, so it's to improve his quality of life.

00:06:38.019 --> 00:06:48.019
At that point, he was still able to speak and very lucid, and he was really grateful for these arrangements made by the brothers in the congregation.

00:06:48.019 --> 00:06:52.019
Loving brothers were willing to spend weeks helping out around the house.

00:07:08.779 --> 00:07:12.779
Sometimes I feel isolated, but not forgotten.

00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:16.779
It's worth putting up with everything we face.

00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:26.779
We have a wonderful hope, which is something we should never forget, and we feel like Jehovah literally carries us in his arms.
