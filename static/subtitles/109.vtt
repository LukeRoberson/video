00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:24.570
Welcome to JW Broadcasting for December 2023.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.570
On September 9, 2023, the 48 students of the 154th

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.570
Class of Gilead graduated in the presence of their family, friends,

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.570
and the United States Bethel family.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.570
Mature brothers serving at Bethel, along with their Gilead instructors,

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.570
gave the students loving encouragement and reminders

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.570
to help them fulfill their commission, to strengthen and stabilize

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.570
God's people wherever they are assigned.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.570
We are sharing these motivating talks with you in Part 1 of this Gilead graduation program.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:08.569
Well, we are here to celebrate with graduating class number 154

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:11.569
of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead.

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:26.590
Are you excited?

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.590
Well, we're excited for you.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.590
And this is the culmination of five months of hard work on your part.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.590
And we want to say that we are proud of each and every one of you.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.590
And we love you.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.590
And we know that you're going to do a tremendous amount of good in your assignments.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.590
Now, unlike the Chairman of the Midweek Meeting,

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.590
I'm not going to be able to give you an overview of the information

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.590
that we're going to hear this morning.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.590
But I can tell you one thing.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.590
I've looked over the themes that the instructors and other responsible brothers have turned in.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.590
And they're mighty interesting.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.590
So let's get started.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.590
Let's hear the first talk.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.590
Now, the first talk is going to be given by brother, Judy Jadley,

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.590
who was recently chosen as a helper to the service committee.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.590
And brother, Jadley's theme is, remember the builder.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.590
Let's listen.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:40.740
A master builder is responsible for every aspect in the creation of a building,

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.740
beginning to end, including oversight of those performing the work.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.740
Jehovah is mankind's master builder.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:56.740
As Gilead students, soon graduates, you have the precious privilege of further supporting the master builder

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.740
by strengthening and stabilizing his building up Jehovah's people.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.740
How can you do that successfully?

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.740
Well, turn to me, please, to the book of the Psalms.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.740
Psalm 127.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.740
127 Psalm.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.740
We'll look at verse one, words of wise King Solomon.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.740
Psalm 127 and verse one.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.740
Unless Jehovah builds the house.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.740
And in Hebrew, a house can also refer to family.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:33.740
So unless Jehovah builds the house, it is in vain that its builders work hard on it.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.740
Unless Jehovah builds the house.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:37.740
That's powerful.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.740
Any endeavor, even well-intentioned that doesn't have Jehovah's blessing,

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.740
will ultimately be in vain.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:52.740
So to build up Jehovah's family, we have to align our efforts with Jehovah's building methods.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.740
So how can we, or how can you successfully do that?

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.740
Build up the branch family where you're assigned.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.740
But I'd like to invite you to the book of Nehemiah.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.740
We'll turn to Nehemiah chapter one.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.740
And we'll see how he applied King Solomon's wise counsel to remember the builder,

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.740
and then what lessons we can learn from him.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.740
We'll begin in chapter one and verse three, where Hanani, Nehemiah's brother,

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.740
is explaining Jerusalem's sad situation.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.740
Let's pick up their conversation.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.740
Verse three, they, or Hanani, and those who traveled with him replied,

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.740
those remaining there in the province who have survived the captivity,

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.740
are in a terrible situation, and in disgrace,

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.740
the walls of Jerusalem are broken down,

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.740
and its gates have been burned with fire.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.740
Now how did Nehemiah react when he heard that information?

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.740
Well, let's look at verse four.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.740
Nehemiah says, as soon as I heard these words,

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.740
I sat down and began to weep and mourn for days.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.740
I kept fasting and notice and praying before the God of the heavens.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.740
This news had a profound impact on him.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.740
He wept, he mourned, he fasted.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.740
Why? Because he loved Jehovah.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.740
Jerusalem was a center of pure worship,

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.740
and he loved his brothers and sisters.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.740
But the question is, what should he do about it?

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.740
He probably wanted to jump in and fix things right away.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.740
But did you notice how he remembered the builder?

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.740
His feelings were appropriate.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.740
Something was needed, but he didn't get ahead of things.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.740
He took time to deal with his feelings,

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.740
and it says he prayed repeatedly.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.740
He focused on the builder.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.740
And it's interesting, Jehovah waited some four months or so

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:36.740
to answer those prayers.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.740
Kids left to nice and,

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.740
whereas the rebuilding itself only took about 52 days.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.740
Now four months may not be a long period of time,

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.740
but it's also not the next day.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.740
In either case, Nehemiah waited for Jehovah's direction.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.740
And when the direction came when the king granted all of the things he had prayed for,

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:02.740
Nehemiah could be confident that it was Jehovah doing the building.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.740
Well, you know how Nehemiah felt.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.740
You've seen Jehovah answer prayers in your life.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.740
Continue to rely on prayer.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.740
Even more so now as you take on new assignments,

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.740
encounter new situations.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.740
And yes, when you have strong feelings on a matter.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.740
Remember the builder.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.740
Get his direction.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.740
Another thing to remember about getting Jehovah's direction

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.740
is that it's not a passive process.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.740
It's an active process.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.740
While Nehemiah waited, he didn't just sit around killing time.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.740
He was active in his spiritual routine and assignment.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.740
And he kept meditating on the situation,

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.740
looking for solutions that Jehovah could bless,

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.740
and then including those in his prayers.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.740
His spiritual routine helped him through the discouraging moments,

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:54.740
and it also helped him remain ready for when the answer did come.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.740
We know this because in Nehemiah chapter two, verses four through eight,

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.740
when King Arthur Zerxes granted his request,

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.740
he asked Nehemiah, how long would your journey be?

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.740
When will you return?

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.740
Nehemiah already had a timetable in mind.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.740
Nehemiah also asked for authorization letters for the governors,

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.740
and for building materials from the keeper of the royal park.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:20.740
Nehemiah had been waiting actively, praying, meditating.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:25.740
Well, situations today will not always be resolved in a day.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.740
But like Nehemiah, your spiritual routine will provide you with stability,

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.740
and it'll help you be ready when the direction comes.

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.740
Another beautiful effect is that your example in the ministry

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:40.740
and in the meetings and in your assignments will also strengthen the friends.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:46.740
As they two face challenges, they'll be helped to remember the builder.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:51.740
Another way to remember the builder is to remember Jehovah's love for people.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:55.740
Nehemiah even under difficult circumstances noticed people.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.740
Turn to chapter three.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.740
We'll look at some of the highlights here in chapter three.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:04.740
Nehemiah is going around the city wall counterclockwise,

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.740
but notice what he describes there in chapter three.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.740
We'll look first in verse one.

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.740
Says the high priest and his brothers were building the sheepgate.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.740
Look at verse two.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.740
The men of Jericho were building.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:18.740
Let's go down to verse five.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:22.740
There we see the humble tocoites working hard,

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.740
but the prominent ones, not so much.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:26.740
There's a lesson in that.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.740
Don't be a prominent tocoite.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.740
We all want to work on the walls.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.740
Go down to verse 12.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.740
Here we notice Shalom who's a prince,

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.740
but who's working with him?

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.740
His hard-working daughters.

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:42.740
It helps us remind us our sisters that do so much in today's efforts to advance kingdom interests.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.740
Turn to verse 20 here in the chapter.

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:49.740
This is barrack worked with fervor.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.740
Nehemiah noticed people,

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.740
and Jehovah inspired him to write about them.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:57.740
Why?

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:01.740
One reason is Jehovah wants us to remember why we're building.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.740
He loves people.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.740
Rebuilding the walls wasn't the end goal.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.740
Rather, rebuilding the walls supported the end goal.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.740
That of glorifying Jehovah, fulfilling prophecy,

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.740
and yes, protecting Jehovah's people.

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.740
Those actual walls were destroyed again later,

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.740
but the account of Nehemiah lives on today.

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.740
And those who worked on the wall,

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.740
they too hoped to live forever.

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:26.740
So get to know the people you're building with.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:27.740
We're wonderful people.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:29.740
Jehovah chooses amazing friends.

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:34.740
And like Nehemiah, appreciate their qualities.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:38.740
Think of your congregation and your department as a spiritual building.

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:41.740
And the individual brothers and sisters were all the stones.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:44.740
The mortar that binds us together

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:48.740
is the love and consideration we show each other.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:51.740
For those of you brothers who may contribute to decision-making

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.740
when you return to your assignments,

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:56.740
humbly consider the ideas of others,

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:59.740
including brothers and sisters under your oversight.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:04.740
Additionally, consider how a decision will affect others.

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:08.740
To strengthen others, we need to know and love them,

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.740
just like the builder does.

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.740
One final thought regarding our master builder.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.740
Jehovah is a happy God.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.740
Imperfection in Satan's system caused suffering.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:19.740
That's true.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.740
But remember that serving Jehovah brings joy

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.740
despite those challenges.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.740
And there is strength in that joy.

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.740
After completing the wall in Nehemiah chapter 8 verse 10,

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:35.740
Nehemiah reminded the people that the joy of Jehovah was their stronghold.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:37.740
Knowing that they had done Jehovah's will

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.740
and had Jehovah's approval gave them strength.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.740
And that had an impact in them.

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:45.740
Notice that in Nehemiah chapter 12,

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:49.740
Nehemiah chapter 12 verse 43.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.740
This verse talks about the day of inauguration

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.740
after all of the challenges had been overcome.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:57.740
And notice how the people felt.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.740
1243.

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:04.740
On that day, they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:08.740
for the true God made them rejoice with great joy.

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.740
The women and the children also rejoiced

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:16.740
so that the rejoicing of Jerusalem could be heard far away.

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:20.740
Even with brand new high walls, they could be heard at a distance.

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.740
Sounds like the joyful noise before our meetings and assemblies

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:26.740
are even here this morning before your graduation program.

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:27.740
But did you notice?

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:31.740
It was Jehovah who made them rejoice.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.740
Despite the challenges now and those to come,

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:39.740
strengthen others by remembering to enjoy Jehovah's service.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:42.740
He's a happy God.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:46.740
His psalmist said, unless Jehovah builds the house,

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.740
well, Jehovah is building the house.

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:52.740
And you dear graduates, along with all of us,

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:56.740
have the wonderful privilege of working alongside him in this building work.

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:59.740
As you strengthen and stabilize Jehovah's people,

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.740
humbly remember the builders.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.740
Seek his direction and prayer.

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:05.740
Stay busy in your spiritual routine.

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:09.740
Love the brothers and sisters and enjoy serving Jehovah.

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:12.740
Like Nehemiah, your guaranteed success

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:15.740
and Jehovah will remember you favorably

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:18.740
when you remember the builder.

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:37.480
I don't know about you, but it makes me want to read the book of Nehemiah all over again.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:41.480
Well, now we're going to hear from another recently appointed helper

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.480
to the service committee, brother Betty Georges,

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:49.480
and he's going to talk to us on the subject, the steps of love.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:54.340
So what do you think?

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:57.340
What are the steps of love?

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:59.340
There are three.

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:02.340
Step one, love of God.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:06.340
Step two, love of neighbor.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:10.340
And step three, love of self.

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:13.340
Now, of course, we're not talking about the selfish, self-centered attitude

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:15.340
that people have today.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:18.340
We all need a measure of self-worth, self-respect.

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.340
If we were to take a picture of these steps,

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:24.340
they would look something like this.

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:26.340
It makes sense that the highest step

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:29.340
and the first love of God

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:33.340
and the lowest and the third step, love of self.

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.340
Because according to the love of the Christ,

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:37.340
we ought to love our neighbor more than self

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:41.340
because we ought to be willing to die for our neighbor.

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:44.340
For the sake of this talk, we'll focus on step three.

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:49.340
Reason being, though the lowest for some,

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:54.340
it may be the hardest to climb because of lack of self-esteem.

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:56.340
The question to use this,

00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:02.340
how can we help others build or boost their self-esteem?

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:04.340
What do you think?

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:05.340
By imitating Christ.

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:06.340
What did He do?

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:09.340
He gave love to others in three ways,

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:11.340
by being encouraging,

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:16.340
by caring and by trusting.

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:18.340
One example of Jesus being encouraging

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:20.340
is found at Luke, chapter 10.

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:23.340
So please follow with me, Luke, chapter 10.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:27.340
And there, as we glance down to verse 27,

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:30.340
we have a man, verse in the law.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.340
And there, he clearly identified the three steps

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:38.340
according to the love of Moses, the Mosaic love.

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:43.340
But note the encouragement Jesus gave him in verse 28.

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:46.340
Verse 28, Luke 10, 28.

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:48.340
Jesus, he said to him,

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:50.340
you answered correctly.

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.340
Keep doing this or giving love,

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:54.340
keep showing love,

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.340
and you will get life.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:59.340
What's the lesson for us?

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:02.340
We want to be quick to give,

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:06.340
yes, commendation, but also motivation.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:08.340
One watcher said this,

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:09.340
he said, watcher said,

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:12.340
at this point, in their ways for life,

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:14.340
our brothers, they don't need critics.

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.340
There's enough critics in the world,

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:22.059
but they need friends to help them reach the finish line.

00:15:22.059 --> 00:15:24.059
At Luke, chapter 18,

00:15:24.059 --> 00:15:28.059
we have an example of Jesus being caring,

00:15:28.059 --> 00:15:30.059
showing tender, loving care.

00:15:30.059 --> 00:15:31.059
So look 18.

00:15:31.059 --> 00:15:33.059
And the context looks,

00:15:33.059 --> 00:15:35.059
look 18, we are, well,

00:15:35.059 --> 00:15:38.059
it's close to spring 33.

00:15:38.059 --> 00:15:39.059
Jesus is on his way.

00:15:39.059 --> 00:15:41.059
He's on a mission going to Jerusalem

00:15:41.059 --> 00:15:43.059
to observe his last Passover.

00:15:43.059 --> 00:15:45.059
And there in verse 35,

00:15:45.059 --> 00:15:47.059
look 18, I'm sure you remember that,

00:15:47.059 --> 00:15:48.059
the context.

00:15:48.059 --> 00:15:50.059
Look 18 is near Jericho,

00:15:50.059 --> 00:15:54.059
and Jericho to Jerusalem is a day's journey.

00:15:54.059 --> 00:15:57.059
And there look 18, 35.

00:15:57.059 --> 00:15:58.059
Near Jericho,

00:15:58.059 --> 00:16:03.059
there's a blind man sitting beside the road begging.

00:16:03.059 --> 00:16:06.059
What did Jesus do for this man?

00:16:06.059 --> 00:16:09.059
Please scroll down to verse 40.

00:16:09.059 --> 00:16:10.059
Verse 40.

00:16:10.059 --> 00:16:12.059
Look 18, verse 40.

00:16:12.059 --> 00:16:14.059
Jesus cared enough to stop.

00:16:14.059 --> 00:16:18.059
He's on a mission, but he stopped.

00:16:18.059 --> 00:16:20.059
Verse 41.

00:16:20.059 --> 00:16:24.059
He cared enough to show personal interest.

00:16:24.059 --> 00:16:25.059
You know this is a question?

00:16:25.059 --> 00:16:26.059
Jesus asked the man,

00:16:26.059 --> 00:16:29.059
what do you want me to do for you?

00:16:29.059 --> 00:16:31.059
And we can try to picture,

00:16:31.059 --> 00:16:33.059
imagine the tone of voice of Jesus.

00:16:33.059 --> 00:16:35.059
What do you want me to do for you?

00:16:35.059 --> 00:16:37.059
Let's think about this a little bit.

00:16:37.059 --> 00:16:40.059
Is it possible Jesus could see the man was blind?

00:16:40.059 --> 00:16:41.059
Probably.

00:16:41.059 --> 00:16:42.059
So why the question?

00:16:42.059 --> 00:16:46.500
Probably to take in consideration his feelings.

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:47.500
What do you need?

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:48.500
What do you want?

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.500
And interestingly, in verse 39,

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:56.500
the crowd was trying to keep this man quiet.

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:59.500
But now in verse 41,

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.500
Jesus speak to me.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.500
What do you want?

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:03.500
What do you need?

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:04.500
How can I help you?

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:07.500
Personal interest.

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:10.500
And to drive home the lesson of this account,

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.500
here's a verified experience.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:19.500
A brother took his nephew 13-year-old to visit Bethel.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.500
And at the time the nephew was going through a family turmoil.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.500
To the point that it caused him to lack motivation.

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.500
So as it turned Bethel,

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:34.480
Bethel light stopped and took a few minutes

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.480
to show personal interest.

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.480
The result?

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.480
At the very next assembly,

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.480
the 13-year-old got baptized.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.480
Two years later, at 15, he started regular pioneer.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.480
At 17, he was appointed a ministeral servant.

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:54.480
Now, as 19, he put in his application for Bethel.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:58.480
All of this because someone stopped

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:01.480
and showed personal interest.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:06.359
Can you think of an example?

00:18:06.359 --> 00:18:09.359
Jesus shone trust to others.

00:18:09.359 --> 00:18:11.359
Well, let's go to look.

00:18:11.359 --> 00:18:13.359
This time, look 32.

00:18:13.359 --> 00:18:14.359
No, 32.

00:18:14.359 --> 00:18:15.359
22.

00:18:15.359 --> 00:18:16.359
Look 22.

00:18:16.359 --> 00:18:20.359
And as we look at verse 34,

00:18:20.359 --> 00:18:23.359
look 22, verse 34.

00:18:23.359 --> 00:18:26.359
It's when Jesus reminded,

00:18:26.359 --> 00:18:28.359
or for war, not reminded for Warren Peter,

00:18:28.359 --> 00:18:31.359
that he would deny him three times.

00:18:31.359 --> 00:18:33.359
Now, let's pause there.

00:18:33.359 --> 00:18:38.359
At that moment, when Peter denied his master three times,

00:18:38.359 --> 00:18:42.359
what do you think was his level of self-worth?

00:18:42.359 --> 00:18:43.359
Yeah.

00:18:43.359 --> 00:18:45.359
At an all-time low.

00:18:45.359 --> 00:18:47.359
Would I be so easy for Peter to just give up?

00:18:47.359 --> 00:18:49.359
Never get back up.

00:18:49.359 --> 00:18:54.359
But what helped him to climb back on to step three?

00:18:54.359 --> 00:18:58.359
Probably what Jesus told him in the verse 32.

00:18:58.359 --> 00:19:01.359
Look at the latter part of verse 32.

00:19:01.359 --> 00:19:03.359
We'll focus on four words.

00:19:03.359 --> 00:19:06.359
You notice once you have returned,

00:19:06.359 --> 00:19:09.359
once you have returned.

00:19:09.359 --> 00:19:11.359
And probably with these words,

00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:13.359
I mean, I'm bringing in Peter's ears,

00:19:13.359 --> 00:19:15.359
as he was down and out,

00:19:15.359 --> 00:19:17.359
and slowly getting back up.

00:19:17.359 --> 00:19:18.359
Once you have returned.

00:19:18.359 --> 00:19:20.359
Because Jesus is expressing what's here,

00:19:20.359 --> 00:19:23.359
expressing confidence.

00:19:23.359 --> 00:19:25.359
Yes, you will fall,

00:19:25.359 --> 00:19:27.359
but you will get back to step three.

00:19:27.359 --> 00:19:28.359
But not only that,

00:19:28.359 --> 00:19:29.359
hey, don't forget step two,

00:19:29.359 --> 00:19:32.359
because you notice the latter part of verse 32,

00:19:32.359 --> 00:19:33.359
once you have returned,

00:19:33.359 --> 00:19:35.359
what's the mission?

00:19:35.359 --> 00:19:37.359
Strengthen.

00:19:37.359 --> 00:19:42.359
And the Greek word little means make firm your brothers.

00:19:42.359 --> 00:19:52.069
Love is eager to believe the best in others.

00:19:52.069 --> 00:19:56.740
Love is trusting.

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.740
So what could be the result,

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:01.740
as we help others to boost their self-esteem?

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.740
Well, let's go back to our image.

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:04.740
What could be the result?

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:07.740
Well, as you climb up to step three,

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:09.740
you agree, it makes it a little bit easier to go on to step two,

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:11.740
love of others,

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:13.740
or love of neighbor,

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:17.740
which is a prerequisite for love of God.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:18.740
Step one.

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:20.740
What did Apostle John say?

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:21.740
What did he say?

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:25.740
Well, we cannot say we love God if we don't love our neighbor.

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:30.690
Having attended Gilead,

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:33.690
so you heard the fine talk about it gently.

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:41.509
What is expected of you to strengthen and stabilize the organization?

00:20:41.509 --> 00:20:43.789
It has been said,

00:20:43.789 --> 00:20:46.789
this can be done one publisher at a time.

00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:49.789
And that reminds me about 10 years ago,

00:20:49.789 --> 00:20:50.789
actually 10 years ago,

00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:53.789
my wife and I were transferred from Canada to Congo.

00:20:53.789 --> 00:20:55.789
And I'll never forget what a friend told me.

00:20:55.789 --> 00:20:56.789
He said, you know what?

00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:57.789
The friends in Congo

00:20:57.789 --> 00:20:59.789
they don't need another Messiah.

00:20:59.789 --> 00:21:00.789
Trust me they don't.

00:21:00.789 --> 00:21:09.150
All they need is love.

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:16.150
So keep on loving as Jesus taught us

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:18.150
by being encouraging,

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:20.150
by caring,

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:23.150
by trusting.

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:27.150
And the friends will give you love back in return.

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:30.150
May Jehovah help you to do just that.

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:46.970
Yes, we love you.

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:49.970
Well, that was worthwhile, wasn't it?

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:51.970
Beautiful presentation.

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:53.970
Now, brother David Ionelli,

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:55.970
who's a member of the writing staff,

00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:57.970
is going to speak to us on the theme,

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:04.279
never forget what Jehovah remembers.

00:22:04.279 --> 00:22:07.279
There's something Jehovah remembers

00:22:07.279 --> 00:22:11.279
that we do well never to forget.

00:22:11.279 --> 00:22:14.279
It involves the way he views us

00:22:14.279 --> 00:22:17.279
and treats us right now.

00:22:17.279 --> 00:22:19.279
And all of us, including you,

00:22:19.279 --> 00:22:21.279
who are graduating from Gilea today,

00:22:21.279 --> 00:22:24.279
do well never to forget it.

00:22:24.279 --> 00:22:26.279
What is it?

00:22:26.279 --> 00:22:30.279
Well, open your Bible please to Psalm 103.

00:22:30.279 --> 00:22:32.279
And the answer is in the familiar words

00:22:32.279 --> 00:22:34.279
recorded at verse 14.

00:22:34.279 --> 00:22:37.279
And just please keep your Bible open here.

00:22:37.279 --> 00:22:39.279
The Psalmist David,

00:22:39.279 --> 00:22:42.279
speaking of Jehovah, says,

00:22:42.279 --> 00:22:45.279
for he well knows how we are formed,

00:22:45.279 --> 00:22:50.279
remembering that we are dust.

00:22:50.279 --> 00:22:54.279
Jehovah remembers that we are dust.

00:22:54.279 --> 00:22:56.279
What does it mean?

00:22:56.279 --> 00:22:59.279
And why should we never forget it?

00:22:59.279 --> 00:23:02.279
Well, first, what does this expression mean?

00:23:02.279 --> 00:23:04.279
Jehovah remembers that we're dust.

00:23:04.279 --> 00:23:07.279
Simply put, this,

00:23:07.279 --> 00:23:11.279
Jehovah is mindful of our sinful nature

00:23:11.279 --> 00:23:16.279
and inclined to forgive repentant sinners.

00:23:16.279 --> 00:23:18.279
Notice how the context indicates this.

00:23:18.279 --> 00:23:21.279
If you look up at verses 1 and 2,

00:23:21.279 --> 00:23:25.279
David begins the Psalm by exhorting himself

00:23:25.279 --> 00:23:29.279
never to forget what Jehovah has done.

00:23:29.279 --> 00:23:31.279
And what has Jehovah done?

00:23:31.279 --> 00:23:35.279
Verse 3, first David mentions,

00:23:35.279 --> 00:23:37.279
Jehovah forgives.

00:23:37.279 --> 00:23:40.279
And in the verses that followed,

00:23:40.279 --> 00:23:43.279
David four times refers to mercy,

00:23:43.279 --> 00:23:47.279
the tender quality that moves Jehovah to forgive,

00:23:47.279 --> 00:23:50.279
and he four times refers to loyal love,

00:23:50.279 --> 00:23:53.279
the love that moves Jehovah to treat us

00:23:53.279 --> 00:23:56.279
as his special property.

00:23:56.279 --> 00:24:00.279
Forgiveness, mercy, loyal love,

00:24:00.279 --> 00:24:02.279
they're connected.

00:24:02.279 --> 00:24:04.279
How so?

00:24:04.279 --> 00:24:08.279
Well, mercy prompts forgiveness.

00:24:08.279 --> 00:24:10.279
As one scholar put it,

00:24:10.279 --> 00:24:13.279
God's mercy is the cause,

00:24:13.279 --> 00:24:17.279
the removal of sin, the result.

00:24:17.279 --> 00:24:19.279
And in this context,

00:24:19.279 --> 00:24:22.279
mercy and forgiveness are part of

00:24:22.279 --> 00:24:25.279
Jehovah's loyal love.

00:24:25.279 --> 00:24:29.279
You might think of Jehovah's loyal love as a large house.

00:24:29.279 --> 00:24:34.279
Well, mercy and forgiveness are spacious rooms in that house.

00:24:34.279 --> 00:24:37.279
And then we come to verses 11 through 13.

00:24:37.279 --> 00:24:41.279
David uses a series of three similes,

00:24:41.279 --> 00:24:45.279
powerful word pictures to describe first the height,

00:24:45.279 --> 00:24:49.279
then the breadth, then the paternal tenderness

00:24:49.279 --> 00:24:52.279
of what one Bible reference where it calls,

00:24:52.279 --> 00:24:56.279
Jehovah's forgiving love.

00:24:56.279 --> 00:24:58.279
And then we come to verse 14.

00:24:58.279 --> 00:25:03.279
David now explains why Jehovah is inclined

00:25:03.279 --> 00:25:06.279
to show us his forgiving love.

00:25:06.279 --> 00:25:10.279
He says, he well knows how we are formed.

00:25:10.279 --> 00:25:13.279
Jehovah is well aware that he formed Adam out of dust

00:25:13.279 --> 00:25:16.279
from the ground and that even perfect humans

00:25:16.279 --> 00:25:19.279
have natural limitations,

00:25:19.279 --> 00:25:22.279
the need to eat, to sleep, to breathe.

00:25:22.279 --> 00:25:24.279
But when Adam and Eve sinned,

00:25:24.279 --> 00:25:28.279
being dust took on new meaning.

00:25:28.279 --> 00:25:30.279
Regarding verse 14,

00:25:30.279 --> 00:25:33.279
the watchtower once explained,

00:25:33.279 --> 00:25:36.279
David was speaking about human frailties

00:25:36.279 --> 00:25:40.279
caused by inherited imperfection.

00:25:40.279 --> 00:25:43.279
So Jehovah is well aware of the frailties,

00:25:43.279 --> 00:25:46.279
the limitations of our sinful nature.

00:25:46.279 --> 00:25:49.279
He understands, he knows how easy it is

00:25:49.279 --> 00:25:51.279
for a how prone we are to sin

00:25:51.279 --> 00:25:55.279
and how strong the temptation to sin can be.

00:25:55.279 --> 00:25:59.279
But Jehovah is not just aware of this.

00:25:59.279 --> 00:26:03.279
David goes on to say, he remembers it.

00:26:03.279 --> 00:26:07.279
And the Hebrew here can mean active remembering.

00:26:07.279 --> 00:26:11.279
It implies a response from the one remembering.

00:26:11.279 --> 00:26:14.279
In other words, because Jehovah remembers

00:26:14.279 --> 00:26:16.279
that we're dust,

00:26:16.279 --> 00:26:19.279
he is moved to do something.

00:26:19.279 --> 00:26:21.279
Do what?

00:26:21.279 --> 00:26:23.279
Well, according to the context,

00:26:23.279 --> 00:26:28.279
to show mercy by forgiving repentant sinners.

00:26:28.279 --> 00:26:29.279
So what's the lesson?

00:26:29.279 --> 00:26:30.279
What's the meaning?

00:26:30.279 --> 00:26:32.279
Jehovah remembers that we're dust?

00:26:32.279 --> 00:26:34.279
Again, put simply,

00:26:34.279 --> 00:26:37.279
he is mindful of our sinful nature

00:26:37.279 --> 00:26:41.279
and inclined to show us his forgiving love.

00:26:41.279 --> 00:26:44.279
We might sum up the lesson with three words.

00:26:44.279 --> 00:26:46.279
Limitations,

00:26:46.279 --> 00:26:48.279
expectations,

00:26:48.279 --> 00:26:51.279
and dealings or actions.

00:26:51.279 --> 00:26:54.279
Because Jehovah understands the limitations

00:26:54.279 --> 00:26:56.279
of our sinful nature,

00:26:56.279 --> 00:27:00.279
he expects that we will fall short at times.

00:27:00.279 --> 00:27:02.279
And when we do,

00:27:02.279 --> 00:27:06.279
he is inclined to deal mercifully with us

00:27:06.279 --> 00:27:09.279
to forgive our repentant heart.

00:27:09.279 --> 00:27:12.279
What about the second question, though?

00:27:12.279 --> 00:27:16.279
Why should we, including you graduating today,

00:27:16.279 --> 00:27:20.279
never forget what Jehovah remembers?

00:27:20.279 --> 00:27:23.279
Well, for you members of the hundred fifty-fourth class,

00:27:23.279 --> 00:27:25.279
not forgetting what Jehovah remembers,

00:27:25.279 --> 00:27:28.279
can actually help you fulfill the purpose

00:27:28.279 --> 00:27:30.279
of your Gilead training,

00:27:30.279 --> 00:27:32.279
which, as we heard,

00:27:32.279 --> 00:27:35.279
is to stabilize and strengthen the work.

00:27:35.279 --> 00:27:39.279
Now, consider two ways that this psalm can help you

00:27:39.279 --> 00:27:42.279
and, by extension, all of us listening in

00:27:42.279 --> 00:27:44.279
to do just that.

00:27:44.279 --> 00:27:47.279
First, to strengthen the work,

00:27:47.279 --> 00:27:51.279
be a force for peace and unity

00:27:51.279 --> 00:27:55.279
by imitating Jehovah's forgiveness.

00:27:55.279 --> 00:27:57.279
How?

00:27:57.279 --> 00:27:59.279
Well, recall the three key words.

00:27:59.279 --> 00:28:04.279
Limitations influence expectations

00:28:04.279 --> 00:28:08.279
which affect how we deal with others.

00:28:08.279 --> 00:28:09.279
Now, it's interesting.

00:28:09.279 --> 00:28:11.279
We often do this automatically.

00:28:11.279 --> 00:28:13.279
Imagine a group of brothers playing soccer,

00:28:13.279 --> 00:28:16.279
one twists his ankle badly.

00:28:16.279 --> 00:28:18.279
The other brothers do not now expect him

00:28:18.279 --> 00:28:21.279
to run, kick, do body feints.

00:28:21.279 --> 00:28:23.279
They see the limitation.

00:28:23.279 --> 00:28:26.279
They adjust their expectations.

00:28:26.279 --> 00:28:29.279
And then they deal kindly,

00:28:29.279 --> 00:28:32.279
perhaps gently helping him off the field.

00:28:32.279 --> 00:28:37.279
And yet, in our everyday interactions with others,

00:28:37.279 --> 00:28:42.279
it is so easy to forget what Jehovah remembers,

00:28:42.279 --> 00:28:46.279
the limitations of our sinful nature.

00:28:46.279 --> 00:28:48.279
So try this.

00:28:48.279 --> 00:28:51.279
When you feel resentment welling up in you

00:28:51.279 --> 00:28:54.279
because of what a fellow worker has said or done,

00:28:54.279 --> 00:28:57.279
stop and ask yourself,

00:28:57.279 --> 00:29:01.279
am I forgetting what Jehovah remembers,

00:29:01.279 --> 00:29:06.279
the limitations of my brother's sinful, imperfect nature?

00:29:06.279 --> 00:29:10.279
You see, by reflecting on the limitation,

00:29:10.279 --> 00:29:13.279
you can adjust your expectations

00:29:13.279 --> 00:29:17.279
which makes it easier to deal mercifully

00:29:17.279 --> 00:29:19.279
by letting go of that resentment

00:29:19.279 --> 00:29:24.279
and thus being a force for peace and unity.

00:29:24.279 --> 00:29:26.279
What about the second way?

00:29:26.279 --> 00:29:29.279
Here's the second way the psalm can help.

00:29:29.279 --> 00:29:34.279
To strengthen the work, strengthen the workers,

00:29:34.279 --> 00:29:40.279
for example, by helping others accept Jehovah's forgiveness.

00:29:40.279 --> 00:29:43.279
At times, you may learn that a fellow worker

00:29:43.279 --> 00:29:48.279
is struggling with stubborn guilt over past mistakes.

00:29:48.279 --> 00:29:52.279
He's forgetting what Jehovah remembers,

00:29:52.279 --> 00:29:55.279
that Jehovah is mindful of our limitations

00:29:55.279 --> 00:29:58.279
and inclined to forgive.

00:29:58.279 --> 00:30:02.279
But perhaps the brother is also remembering

00:30:02.279 --> 00:30:04.279
what Jehovah forgets,

00:30:04.279 --> 00:30:07.279
the sins that he's already forgiven

00:30:07.279 --> 00:30:10.279
and will never hold against that brother.

00:30:10.279 --> 00:30:12.279
How can you help him?

00:30:12.279 --> 00:30:13.279
Well, try this.

00:30:13.279 --> 00:30:16.279
Use Psalm 103, 14 to remind him

00:30:16.279 --> 00:30:20.279
of why Jehovah is inclined to forgive

00:30:20.279 --> 00:30:22.279
and then perhaps use verse 12

00:30:22.279 --> 00:30:26.279
to remind him of how far-reaching that forgiveness is.

00:30:26.279 --> 00:30:28.279
Verse 12 reads,

00:30:28.279 --> 00:30:31.279
as far off as the sunrise or east

00:30:31.279 --> 00:30:34.279
is from the sunset or west,

00:30:34.279 --> 00:30:39.279
so far off he has put our transgressions.

00:30:39.279 --> 00:30:42.279
How far is east from west?

00:30:42.279 --> 00:30:46.279
The close to Jehovah book explains it this way.

00:30:46.279 --> 00:30:49.279
In a sense, east is always

00:30:49.279 --> 00:30:54.279
at the utmost distance imaginable from west.

00:30:54.279 --> 00:30:57.279
The two points can never meet.

00:30:57.279 --> 00:31:01.279
So what does that mean for our sins?

00:31:01.279 --> 00:31:04.279
One reference work explained it this way.

00:31:04.279 --> 00:31:08.279
If sin be removed so far,

00:31:08.279 --> 00:31:11.279
then we may be sure that the scent,

00:31:11.279 --> 00:31:14.279
the trace, the very memory of it

00:31:14.279 --> 00:31:18.279
must be entirely gone.

00:31:18.279 --> 00:31:21.279
A scent can trigger a memory.

00:31:21.279 --> 00:31:23.279
But when Jehovah forgives,

00:31:23.279 --> 00:31:25.279
he puts our sins so far off

00:31:25.279 --> 00:31:28.279
that there remains not even the trace of a scent

00:31:28.279 --> 00:31:31.279
that could possibly trigger him to remember it

00:31:31.279 --> 00:31:34.279
and hold it against us.

00:31:34.279 --> 00:31:38.279
Use Psalm 103 to help others

00:31:38.279 --> 00:31:42.279
except Jehovah's far-reaching forgiveness.

00:31:42.279 --> 00:31:44.279
If you strengthen the worker,

00:31:44.279 --> 00:31:47.279
you strengthen the work.

00:31:47.279 --> 00:31:50.279
So for you members of the 144th class,

00:31:50.279 --> 00:31:52.279
as you leave here today,

00:31:52.279 --> 00:31:56.279
may you be determined to use your gillied training

00:31:56.279 --> 00:31:59.279
to strengthen the work and the workers.

00:31:59.279 --> 00:32:02.279
And to that end, let the beautiful words

00:32:02.279 --> 00:32:05.279
of Psalm 103 help you to number one,

00:32:05.279 --> 00:32:08.279
be a force for peace and unity

00:32:08.279 --> 00:32:11.279
by imitating Jehovah's forgiveness.

00:32:11.279 --> 00:32:15.279
And number two, help downhearted ones

00:32:15.279 --> 00:32:19.279
to correct that far-reaching forgiveness.

00:32:19.279 --> 00:32:23.279
The lesson for you is really a lesson for us all.

00:32:23.279 --> 00:32:27.279
May we never forget what Jehovah remembers

00:32:27.279 --> 00:32:28.279
and while we're at it,

00:32:28.279 --> 00:32:31.279
may we also do our best not to remember

00:32:31.279 --> 00:32:47.529
what Jehovah forgets.

00:32:47.529 --> 00:32:51.529
We appreciate that warm reassurance.

00:32:51.529 --> 00:32:54.529
Now the next three speakers

00:32:54.529 --> 00:32:57.529
are all members of the teaching staff

00:32:57.529 --> 00:33:00.529
and Brother Clark here is the latest addition

00:33:00.529 --> 00:33:02.529
to the teaching staff.

00:33:02.529 --> 00:33:04.529
He was serving in Czechia,

00:33:04.529 --> 00:33:07.529
the Czech Republic, before he came here.

00:33:07.529 --> 00:33:08.529
I guess it was this year.

00:33:08.529 --> 00:33:10.529
Was it Jeremy? You came here?

00:33:10.529 --> 00:33:13.529
Anyway, he's going to speak to us on the theme,

00:33:13.529 --> 00:33:15.529
may Jehovah know.

00:33:15.529 --> 00:33:20.769
He was buried with the kings,

00:33:20.769 --> 00:33:22.769
but he was not a king.

00:33:22.769 --> 00:33:24.769
He lived 130 years,

00:33:24.769 --> 00:33:27.769
but perhaps for the first 90 years of his life,

00:33:27.769 --> 00:33:30.769
there is nothing recorded what he achieved.

00:33:30.769 --> 00:33:33.769
And one major event that was recorded,

00:33:33.769 --> 00:33:35.769
he had to keep secret

00:33:35.769 --> 00:33:38.769
without others knowing for about six years.

00:33:38.769 --> 00:33:40.769
Who is this man?

00:33:40.769 --> 00:33:42.769
Hi, priest Jehojada.

00:33:42.769 --> 00:33:46.769
What does Jehovah want you to know about him?

00:33:46.769 --> 00:33:47.769
It is this.

00:33:47.769 --> 00:33:50.769
Jehojada was loyal to Jehovah

00:33:50.769 --> 00:33:53.769
even without recognition from others.

00:33:53.769 --> 00:33:55.769
So the question to you is,

00:33:55.769 --> 00:33:58.769
if only Jehovah knows

00:33:58.769 --> 00:34:01.769
what you do and your loyalty,

00:34:01.769 --> 00:34:03.769
without recognition from others,

00:34:03.769 --> 00:34:07.769
is that enough to sustain you in your loyalty?

00:34:07.769 --> 00:34:09.769
For how long? A year?

00:34:09.769 --> 00:34:11.769
Two?

00:34:11.769 --> 00:34:12.769
Six?

00:34:12.769 --> 00:34:13.769
Longer?

00:34:13.769 --> 00:34:18.460
Before you came to Gilead School,

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:20.460
maybe it mattered more to you

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:22.460
what others saw on you,

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:23.460
what they thought of you,

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:25.460
your achievements.

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:29.460
But in class, a deep study of the scriptures

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:31.460
opened up your heart.

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:33.460
You looked at attitudes and feelings

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:37.460
and thoughts, perhaps hidden there for a long time.

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:39.460
You looked long and hard

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:42.460
at the secret person of the heart,

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:45.460
which is of great value in the eyes of God.

00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:48.460
The inner you.

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:50.460
And this drew you closer to Jehovah.

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:52.460
You felt his reassuring love.

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:54.460
Now more than ever,

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:57.460
I realize how much Jehovah sees you

00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:59.460
and knows you.

00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:01.460
Do you not have the same thoughts

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:05.780
as we find in Psalm 139?

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:11.489
Let's read the first four verses.

00:35:11.489 --> 00:35:15.469
Psalm 139.

00:35:15.469 --> 00:35:17.469
Oh, Jehovah,

00:35:17.469 --> 00:35:19.469
you have searched through me

00:35:19.469 --> 00:35:21.469
and you know me.

00:35:21.469 --> 00:35:24.469
You know when I sit down

00:35:24.469 --> 00:35:27.469
and when I rise up.

00:35:27.469 --> 00:35:29.469
You discern my thoughts from afar.

00:35:29.469 --> 00:35:33.469
You observe the way I travel

00:35:33.469 --> 00:35:35.469
and when I lie down.

00:35:35.469 --> 00:35:38.469
You're familiar with all my ways.

00:35:38.469 --> 00:35:40.469
There is not a word on my tongue,

00:35:40.469 --> 00:35:42.469
but look, oh, Jehovah,

00:35:42.469 --> 00:35:47.670
you know it well.

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:50.670
You have joy that Jehovah knows you.

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:51.670
He always knew you,

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:54.670
but now you know that he knows you.

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:57.670
And you feel more secure in your relationship with him,

00:35:57.670 --> 00:36:01.670
less concern about recognition from others.

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:07.690
This was Hyper-East Jehovah.

00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:09.690
Now, he was born some years

00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:13.690
after King Solomon's Temple was completed in 1027 BCE.

00:36:13.690 --> 00:36:16.690
That means in his lifetime,

00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:18.690
the nation of Israel split into

00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:21.690
leaving only the two tribe kingdom

00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:23.690
using the temple.

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:25.690
He saw kings of Judah

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:28.690
introduce idolatry, sex worship.

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:30.690
There were two good kings,

00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:32.690
Asa and Jehoshaphat.

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:35.690
But remember, Jehoshaphat had his son,

00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:37.690
Mary Jezebel's daughter,

00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:38.690
Athalia from the north,

00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:40.690
and brought her wicked influence

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:42.690
right into Jerusalem.

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:46.690
Things were going from bad to worse.

00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:48.690
And in just a hundred years,

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:50.690
the temple was so neglected

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:52.690
that it needed a major repair

00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:55.690
just to be structurally sound again.

00:36:55.690 --> 00:36:59.690
Meanwhile, they built a temple for bail worship.

00:36:59.690 --> 00:37:00.690
Judah sees all this.

00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:03.690
Here he's an old man, the high priest.

00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:05.690
How did he keep his loyalty

00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:08.690
through those distressing years?

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:10.690
The Bible doesn't say.

00:37:10.690 --> 00:37:14.610
But Jehovah knows it all

00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:17.610
through meditation, prayer.

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:20.610
Wouldn't he have to look at his own heart,

00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:22.610
his inner person?

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:23.610
Look at his attitude

00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:26.610
and his feelings towards pure worship?

00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:29.610
Not becoming lax

00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:30.610
and standing for what is right.

00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:32.610
Unlike high priest Eli,

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:34.610
when he got old.

00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:36.610
And here, Jehoya is a man of authority,

00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:38.610
yet he doesn't step outside

00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:41.610
of the bounds of his assignment.

00:37:41.610 --> 00:37:44.610
But he patiently waits on Jehovah.

00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:48.179
Well, these years of loyal love

00:37:48.179 --> 00:37:50.179
helped him face a greatest challenge

00:37:50.179 --> 00:37:52.179
when he was old.

00:37:52.179 --> 00:37:53.179
And this he had to do

00:37:53.179 --> 00:37:56.179
without others knowing.

00:37:56.179 --> 00:37:58.179
What was that?

00:37:58.179 --> 00:38:01.179
Well, it's around 905 BCE.

00:38:01.179 --> 00:38:03.179
And let's pick up the account

00:38:03.179 --> 00:38:09.019
in 2 Chronicles 22.

00:38:09.019 --> 00:38:11.019
Here we find King Ayazaya of Judah

00:38:11.019 --> 00:38:13.019
has died.

00:38:13.019 --> 00:38:17.019
And then the unimaginable happens.

00:38:17.019 --> 00:38:19.019
2 Chronicles 22,

00:38:19.019 --> 00:38:22.869
we'll start at verse 10.

00:38:22.869 --> 00:38:25.869
When Atholaya, Ayazaya's mother,

00:38:25.869 --> 00:38:27.869
saw that her son had died.

00:38:27.869 --> 00:38:29.869
She rose up and destroyed

00:38:29.869 --> 00:38:32.869
the entire royal line

00:38:32.869 --> 00:38:36.340
of the house of Judah.

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:38.340
Atholaya kills her own grand sons

00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:40.340
and makes herself queen illegally.

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:42.340
Now the Davidic line

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:44.340
to the promised offspring

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:46.340
is at risk of being cut off.

00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:48.340
Let's read verse 11.

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:49.340
However,

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:52.340
Geosabius, the daughter of the king,

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:54.340
took Jehoash, the son of Ayazaya,

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:56.340
and stole him away from among

00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:58.340
the sons of the king,

00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:00.340
who would have been put to death.

00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:02.340
And she put him and his nurse

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:04.340
in an inner bedroom.

00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:05.340
Who's Geosabius?

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:06.340
Read on.

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:08.340
She's the daughter of King Jehorim.

00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:10.340
She was the wife of Jehoaida,

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:11.340
the priest,

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:16.070
and the sister of Ayazaya.

00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:19.070
And she managed to keep him,

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:21.070
the baby, concealed from Atholaya

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:24.070
so that she did not put him to death.

00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:26.070
He remained with him for six years,

00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:28.070
hidden at the house of the true God,

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:31.070
while Atholaya was ruling over the land.

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:33.070
For six long years,

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:35.070
Jehoaida, Geosabius,

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:37.070
and a nurse had a big secret,

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:38.070
a small baby,

00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:41.070
in the last living air.

00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:42.070
Now,

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:46.070
it's possible that this inner bedroom

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:48.070
could have been a storage room

00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:50.070
at the palace.

00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:51.070
And when it was safe,

00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:53.070
they smuggled the baby into a chamber

00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:55.070
in the temple.

00:39:55.070 --> 00:39:56.070
If that happened,

00:39:56.070 --> 00:39:58.070
imagine the risk,

00:39:58.070 --> 00:39:59.070
the timing would have to be perfect

00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:02.070
so they wouldn't get caught.

00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:04.070
And in the temple for six years,

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:08.070
do you think there were some close calls?

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:09.070
While at one point,

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:11.070
Atholaya's own sons broke into the temple,

00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:13.070
stole items for bail worship.

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:15.070
If that happened during this period,

00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:17.070
imagine if they saw the child,

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:19.070
game over.

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:21.380
This means that not once,

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:23.380
could Jehoaida or Geosabius

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:25.380
let out their secret.

00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:27.380
They couldn't complain to others.

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:29.380
They couldn't give up.

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:31.380
They couldn't give up.

00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:34.380
That means they had no recognition.

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:36.380
No acknowledgement,

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:38.380
no appreciation for their effort.

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:42.980
That means they rely on prayer,

00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:44.980
looking to only Jehovah

00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:47.980
for support and reassurance.

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:49.980
They would look to the scriptures,

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:50.980
like Psalm 139.

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:51.980
Oh, Jehovah,

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:52.980
you know me.

00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:54.980
You can hear them adapted to their situation.

00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:59.980
You know that we're protecting the rightful king.

00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:01.980
And they're not just babysitting for six years,

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:03.980
they're teaching the child to love Jehovah.

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:04.980
Love his law.

00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:08.579
Be a good king for Judah.

00:41:08.579 --> 00:41:11.579
They would have to work unitedly as a couple.

00:41:11.579 --> 00:41:15.119
And that brings us to her.

00:41:15.119 --> 00:41:17.119
Let's talk about her for a moment.

00:41:17.119 --> 00:41:18.119
Geosabius.

00:41:18.119 --> 00:41:20.119
Clearly, Jehovah gives her the credit

00:41:20.119 --> 00:41:23.119
for saving her nephew, Jehoash.

00:41:23.119 --> 00:41:26.119
But at this point, how old is she?

00:41:26.119 --> 00:41:28.119
Well, her father, King Jehorim,

00:41:28.119 --> 00:41:30.119
who died the year before,

00:41:30.119 --> 00:41:33.119
was only 40 years old.

00:41:33.119 --> 00:41:36.119
So she is still quite young.

00:41:36.119 --> 00:41:38.119
And yet married to a man,

00:41:38.119 --> 00:41:41.119
some decades older than her.

00:41:41.119 --> 00:41:43.119
So here we have a young woman,

00:41:43.119 --> 00:41:45.119
who is royalty,

00:41:45.119 --> 00:41:47.119
married to a much older man,

00:41:47.119 --> 00:41:49.119
who has a position of high rank.

00:41:49.119 --> 00:41:50.119
What's her angle?

00:41:50.119 --> 00:41:52.119
Is she abusing her authority?

00:41:52.119 --> 00:41:54.119
Is she trying to manipulate things,

00:41:54.119 --> 00:41:57.119
like her stepmother Athalia?

00:41:57.119 --> 00:42:00.119
No, she's risking her life

00:42:00.119 --> 00:42:02.119
to protect the rightful king

00:42:02.119 --> 00:42:04.119
in line with Jehovah's will,

00:42:04.119 --> 00:42:07.119
supporting her husband and, apparently,

00:42:07.119 --> 00:42:11.099
without recognition from others.

00:42:11.099 --> 00:42:15.099
She reminds us of you, dear sisters.

00:42:15.099 --> 00:42:17.099
Much of what you achieve

00:42:17.099 --> 00:42:18.099
may not be as noticeable

00:42:18.099 --> 00:42:21.099
as your husband's achievements.

00:42:21.099 --> 00:42:25.099
And that could just be the nature of the assignment.

00:42:25.099 --> 00:42:28.099
Which means you may get less attention.

00:42:28.099 --> 00:42:30.099
But you take pleasure

00:42:30.099 --> 00:42:33.099
in that Jehovah knows all that you do for him.

00:42:33.099 --> 00:42:35.099
And we love you for that.

00:42:35.099 --> 00:42:38.670
So you brothers,

00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:41.670
many things you do will be noticed.

00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:43.670
There may be some things

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:45.670
where you won't get recognition,

00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:47.670
perhaps for a long time.

00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:49.670
And by the way,

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:52.670
it's not wrong to get recognition.

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:55.670
As humans, we thrive on it.

00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:57.670
And if you're ever in a position

00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:59.670
where you can recognize the good work

00:42:59.670 --> 00:43:01.670
or loyalty of someone else,

00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:02.670
don't pass it up.

00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:03.670
Let them know.

00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:05.670
They appreciate it.

00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:09.670
However, your loyalty is based on

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:11.670
not what others will see and know,

00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:13.670
but on the unseen.

00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:16.670
Loyalty from the heart.

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:19.670
Remember, Jehojada.

00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:22.670
Yes, eventually everybody found out what he did

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:23.670
and he got honored.

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:26.670
But what was the secret to his success?

00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:28.670
Was it not in the years before?

00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:30.670
The small things, the hidden things,

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:34.670
the unseen, things only Jehovah knows?

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:37.670
The name Jehojada means

00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:39.670
may Jehovah know

00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:42.670
how fitting may Jehovah know

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:45.670
all your loyal acts.

00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:46.670
Seen and unseen

00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:49.670
and your father, who looks on in secret,

00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:50.670
will repay you.

00:43:50.670 --> 00:44:07.820
That certainly brought Jehojada to life, didn't it?

00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:09.820
Well, Mark, New Mary,

00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:12.820
usually has something very interesting to say.

00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:17.199
Today, no pressure.

00:44:18.199 --> 00:44:21.199
Today, he's going to talk to us on the subject,

00:44:21.199 --> 00:44:27.210
side by side.

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:29.210
We don't know her name,

00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:32.210
but we know her husband.

00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:34.210
He was a hard-working fisherman,

00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:36.210
outspoken apostle,

00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:38.210
writer of two Bible books,

00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:41.210
and the only person besides Jesus to walk on water,

00:44:41.210 --> 00:44:44.210
we know Peter.

00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:47.210
But sometimes we forget his wife.

00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:49.210
What was Peter's wife like?

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:52.210
What were they like as a married couple?

00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:56.210
And what can they teach you 24 married couples?

00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:59.210
This is the first time in close to a decade

00:44:59.210 --> 00:45:03.210
we've had an entire class of only married couples.

00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:06.210
Thus, we've chosen Peter and his wife

00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:10.210
so that you can learn specific lessons

00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:15.210
that you can bring to your places of assignment,

00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:17.210
but especially to strengthen your marriages

00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:19.210
as you apply this

00:45:19.210 --> 00:45:23.210
and you serve together side by side.

00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:28.210
Let's begin by reading Mark chapter 1.

00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:33.210
Mark chapter 1 verse 16.

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:36.210
While walking alongside the sea of Galilee,

00:45:36.210 --> 00:45:38.210
he saw Simon. That's Jesus saw Simon

00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:41.210
and Simon's brother Andrew casting their nets

00:45:41.210 --> 00:45:44.210
into the sea for their fishermen.

00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:48.210
Peter's a fisherman.

00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:50.210
He brings home the fish.

00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:52.210
His wife cooks the fish.

00:45:52.210 --> 00:45:54.210
And if she doesn't cook the fish,

00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:55.210
she sells the fish.

00:45:55.210 --> 00:45:58.210
Like a capable proverbs 31 wife,

00:45:58.210 --> 00:46:01.210
brings home the money that helps support the house.

00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:05.210
It allows Peter to handle his responsibilities.

00:46:05.210 --> 00:46:07.210
All as well.

00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:08.210
A great couple,

00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:10.210
working side by side together.

00:46:10.210 --> 00:46:12.210
However,

00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:16.210
life changes suddenly.

00:46:16.210 --> 00:46:19.210
Verse 17 and 18.

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:21.210
So Jesus said to them,

00:46:21.210 --> 00:46:24.210
come after me and I will make you fishers of men

00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:29.210
and at once they abandon their nets and followed him.

00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:31.210
In faith,

00:46:31.210 --> 00:46:35.210
Peter abandons his fishing business and follows Jesus.

00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:38.210
What did she think about that?

00:46:38.210 --> 00:46:40.210
Did she expect that?

00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:42.210
Did she become insecure

00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:45.210
and uncertain now about the future?

00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:49.210
Did which he feel that her life now has been upended

00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:51.210
by the decisions of her impulsive,

00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:52.210
big-hearted husband?

00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:55.210
Peter, what are you doing?

00:46:55.210 --> 00:46:59.210
We have very good reason to conclude

00:46:59.210 --> 00:47:03.210
that Peter's wife supported the decision

00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:07.210
and willing to and ready to stand right at Peter's side

00:47:07.210 --> 00:47:12.210
as he took on added responsibilities.

00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:15.210
Let's gain more insight into the life of Peter

00:47:15.210 --> 00:47:19.210
and his wife with verse 29.

00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:22.809
At that, they left the synagogue

00:47:22.809 --> 00:47:26.809
and went to the home of Simon and Andrew,

00:47:26.809 --> 00:47:29.809
with James and John.

00:47:29.809 --> 00:47:31.809
Well, this verse explains that they went to the home

00:47:31.809 --> 00:47:33.809
of Simon and Andrew.

00:47:33.809 --> 00:47:36.809
They lived together.

00:47:36.809 --> 00:47:38.809
So Peter's wife was agreeable

00:47:38.809 --> 00:47:42.809
to sharing her living space with Andrew.

00:47:42.809 --> 00:47:44.809
Peter's brother.

00:47:44.809 --> 00:47:48.809
And likely the close friends of Peter,

00:47:48.809 --> 00:47:52.809
James and John, were frequent guests.

00:47:52.809 --> 00:47:54.809
And you can hear Peter saying,

00:47:54.809 --> 00:47:56.809
come over anytime.

00:47:56.809 --> 00:47:59.809
And his wife does the cooking.

00:47:59.809 --> 00:48:01.809
That's the way it would work.

00:48:01.809 --> 00:48:05.809
She could most likely hear the sons of thunder coming.

00:48:05.809 --> 00:48:09.059
Here they come.

00:48:09.059 --> 00:48:12.059
And Peter says, that's them.

00:48:12.059 --> 00:48:15.059
Cook more fish.

00:48:15.059 --> 00:48:18.059
That's the way it probably would be.

00:48:18.059 --> 00:48:20.059
But here's the question.

00:48:20.059 --> 00:48:25.059
Why could Peter feel free to bring his friends home?

00:48:25.059 --> 00:48:30.780
And sometimes most likely they came in an unexpected manner

00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:34.780
because he knew his wife.

00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:37.780
And interestingly, when he wrote his first letter,

00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:41.780
he advised husbands to dwell with their wives

00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:44.780
according to knowledge.

00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:47.780
Peter knew his wife.

00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:50.780
And he knew that she would be willing to accommodate

00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:55.780
the guests because she knew her husband.

00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:56.780
That's Peter.

00:48:56.780 --> 00:49:00.099
Come on over.

00:49:00.099 --> 00:49:03.099
She and Peter were a team.

00:49:03.099 --> 00:49:06.099
She knew that having them in the home

00:49:06.099 --> 00:49:09.099
inconvenience, we get that.

00:49:09.099 --> 00:49:13.099
But think of the conversations that she would be privy to

00:49:13.099 --> 00:49:17.099
as Peter and you, James, John, would discuss Jesus' ministry.

00:49:17.099 --> 00:49:20.099
She would sit there, oh my, I'm so glad they came.

00:49:20.099 --> 00:49:25.099
The blessing that she would get as they talked about Jesus' ministry.

00:49:25.099 --> 00:49:28.099
So here's your first big lesson.

00:49:28.099 --> 00:49:32.099
Something very similar can happen to you as a couple.

00:49:32.099 --> 00:49:35.099
Your husband's good shepherding.

00:49:35.099 --> 00:49:39.099
It will result in warm conversations

00:49:39.099 --> 00:49:43.099
and strong friendships are forged.

00:49:43.099 --> 00:49:48.099
And that could lead to spontaneous invitations.

00:49:48.099 --> 00:49:52.099
Like, say, come on over for a snack.

00:49:52.099 --> 00:49:56.099
And you get a text, guess who's coming to dinner?

00:49:56.099 --> 00:50:00.099
But is it inconvenient at times?

00:50:00.099 --> 00:50:01.099
Yes.

00:50:01.099 --> 00:50:04.099
But there is a Bible principle.

00:50:04.099 --> 00:50:08.099
And the Bible principle here overrides all cultures past and present.

00:50:08.099 --> 00:50:13.099
Be self-sacrificing and hospitable.

00:50:13.099 --> 00:50:16.099
So be like Peter and his wife.

00:50:16.099 --> 00:50:20.099
And think of the spiritual blessings you would receive

00:50:20.099 --> 00:50:23.099
as you get to know your brothers and sisters better.

00:50:23.099 --> 00:50:28.099
That overrides even the inconvenience.

00:50:29.099 --> 00:50:33.099
But the self-sacrificing spirit of this dynamic couple

00:50:33.099 --> 00:50:35.099
doesn't stop there.

00:50:35.099 --> 00:50:38.860
Let's read verse 30.

00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:41.860
Now Simon's mother-in-law was lying down sick with a fever.

00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:44.860
And they at once told her about, they once told him,

00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:47.860
Jesus about her.

00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:51.860
So now we learn that Peter and his wife are caring for a parent.

00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:54.860
And at this moment she is sick.

00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:57.860
And what demands that place is on a married couple

00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:01.860
you know that, caring for a sick parent.

00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:03.860
And for a married couple to live with one in law

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:06.860
naturally has its challenges.

00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:09.860
But living with a brother-in-law and a mother-in-law,

00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:14.860
now that brings it to an entirely new level.

00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:18.860
Can you hear Peter's wife whispering to Peter?

00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:22.860
Your brother Andrew is driving me crazy.

00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:24.860
And Peter being tempted to blurt out,

00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:26.860
well what about your mother?

00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:32.329
No, but we're not saying that ever happened.

00:51:32.329 --> 00:51:38.329
Nevertheless, we know that living with in laws and caring

00:51:38.329 --> 00:51:43.329
for aging parents poses unique challenges for a couple.

00:51:43.329 --> 00:51:46.329
That would require great sacrifices.

00:51:46.329 --> 00:51:48.329
That's what we're talking about.

00:51:48.329 --> 00:51:53.329
However, with sacrifices comes blessings.

00:51:53.329 --> 00:51:56.329
Just as we've discussed over and over in class,

00:51:56.329 --> 00:51:59.329
where the sacrifice comes a blessing.

00:51:59.329 --> 00:52:01.329
Verse 31.

00:52:01.329 --> 00:52:04.329
Jesus performs a miracle right in the home.

00:52:04.329 --> 00:52:06.329
Mom is cured.

00:52:06.329 --> 00:52:07.329
Imagine that.

00:52:07.329 --> 00:52:08.329
Mom is cured.

00:52:08.329 --> 00:52:11.329
What a tender intimate moment this must have been

00:52:11.329 --> 00:52:13.329
for Peter and his wife.

00:52:13.329 --> 00:52:14.329
Thank Jehovah.

00:52:14.329 --> 00:52:18.329
They probably said it heartfelt prayer thanking Jehovah.

00:52:18.329 --> 00:52:22.329
Intimate, quiet, prayerful.

00:52:22.329 --> 00:52:24.329
But look what happens next.

00:52:24.329 --> 00:52:27.329
Verse 32 and 33.

00:52:27.329 --> 00:52:30.329
After evening had fallen, when the sun had set,

00:52:30.329 --> 00:52:34.329
the people began bringing to him all who were ill and demon possessed.

00:52:34.329 --> 00:52:38.329
And the whole city was gathered right at the door.

00:52:38.329 --> 00:52:40.329
Where's the intimacy now?

00:52:40.329 --> 00:52:43.329
It went from quiet to chaos.

00:52:43.329 --> 00:52:46.329
Imagine the scene, sick people from all over.

00:52:46.329 --> 00:52:49.329
Come to Peter's house to get healed.

00:52:49.329 --> 00:52:56.699
How would you feel the whole city of sick and demon possessed people showed up at your door?

00:52:56.699 --> 00:52:58.699
Talk about uninvited guests.

00:52:58.699 --> 00:53:03.699
And Peter's wife didn't have time to prepare and plan and make the house a perfect.

00:53:03.699 --> 00:53:05.699
And not yet the table's not right.

00:53:05.699 --> 00:53:06.699
The chairs aren't right.

00:53:06.699 --> 00:53:08.699
No, that wasn't it.

00:53:08.699 --> 00:53:09.699
Things weren't perfect.

00:53:09.699 --> 00:53:13.699
And what if a crowd that size damaged the home?

00:53:13.699 --> 00:53:16.699
Like the desperate Jews who won a later occasion

00:53:16.699 --> 00:53:22.699
made a hole in someone's roof to drop down someone so that they could be healed?

00:53:22.699 --> 00:53:28.909
At this point, Peter's wife certainly could have complained.

00:53:28.909 --> 00:53:30.909
Get these people out of here.

00:53:30.909 --> 00:53:33.909
But there is no record of a complaint.

00:53:33.909 --> 00:53:37.320
Consider this.

00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:44.320
Years later, when Peter counseled wives to cultivate the quiet and mild spirit,

00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:48.320
did his wife's example give him the freedom of speech

00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:51.320
to offer that advice?

00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:55.320
And Peter must have thanked his wife, thanked her,

00:53:55.320 --> 00:54:03.320
for her loyally being by his side as they supported Jesus' ministry.

00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:06.320
Another big lesson for you.

00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:09.320
As you deal with aging parents and health issues,

00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:15.320
look for Jehovah's Blessing and enjoy your periods of calm.

00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:21.320
However, remember that we are living at a time when the scene of the world is changing.

00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:23.320
And it can change quickly.

00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:28.320
A natural disaster, civil unrest, can break out unexpectedly.

00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:31.320
And you might have to accommodate those seeking aid.

00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:35.320
And though you might not be ready for that, things aren't perfect.

00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:38.320
Don't worry about that.

00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:43.320
But allow yourself sacrificing spirit to just move forward,

00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:45.320
going the extra mile.

00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:53.320
And husbands don't forget to thank your wife for being by your side

00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:57.320
as you respond to the needs of the organization.

00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:04.369
First Corinthians chapter 9 and verse 5 indicates that Peter's wife traveled with him

00:55:04.369 --> 00:55:07.369
for at least some of the time.

00:55:07.369 --> 00:55:13.369
Traveling with Peter would have included hard trips, dangerous conditions.

00:55:14.369 --> 00:55:18.369
Peter was arrested in Jerusalem one time, two times, three times arrested again,

00:55:18.369 --> 00:55:19.369
flogged.

00:55:19.369 --> 00:55:21.369
This time James was arrested with him.

00:55:21.369 --> 00:55:23.369
James is beheaded.

00:55:23.369 --> 00:55:27.369
Would Peter's wife say, well, I see my husband again?

00:55:27.369 --> 00:55:36.219
It could not have been easy to be married to a man so involved in sacred service.

00:55:36.219 --> 00:55:44.219
Between the year 62 and 64, we find Peter who is now perhaps in his 60s.

00:55:44.219 --> 00:55:51.219
Going with the need is greater in Babylon, where Jehovah inspired him to write two letters.

00:55:51.219 --> 00:55:59.539
As he is finishing his second letter and what now would become the twilight of his life,

00:55:59.539 --> 00:56:13.070
how thankful he must have been to have had such a faithful, loving, loyal wife by his side over the years.

00:56:13.070 --> 00:56:19.070
The things considered, here's the gold, work on selflessly as a team.

00:56:19.070 --> 00:56:24.070
Be positive when confronted with unexpected challenges.

00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:30.070
And husbands highly value the loyal support of your wife and thank her.

00:56:30.070 --> 00:56:38.070
Wives realize that after Jehovah in Jesus, you are probably the closest person that can work intimately

00:56:38.070 --> 00:56:43.070
with your husband for his success and, of course, your own.

00:56:43.070 --> 00:57:12.309
And for you 24 dear couples, be determined to maintain your stride as you serve together side by side.

00:57:12.309 --> 00:57:15.309
Well, that was very enjoyable, wasn't it?

00:57:15.309 --> 00:57:18.309
We hope you enjoyed Part 1.

00:57:18.309 --> 00:57:24.309
Parts 2 and 3 will be available on JW.org later this month.

00:57:24.309 --> 00:57:28.309
Our postcard for this month is from Uruguay.

00:57:28.309 --> 00:57:38.309
Located between Argentina and Brazil, Uruguay has beautiful coastlines along the Atlantic Ocean and rolling hills in its interior.

00:57:38.309 --> 00:57:44.309
The pristine beaches of Punta del Este is a popular tourist destination.

00:57:44.309 --> 00:57:50.309
Several rivers in the country, such as the Rio Negro and the Rio de la Plata,

00:57:50.309 --> 00:57:55.309
create stunning landscapes and make the soil fertile.

00:57:55.309 --> 00:58:02.309
These breathtaking views provide a picturesque backdrop for preaching the good news.

00:58:02.309 --> 00:58:11.309
Uruguay currently has 149 congregations preaching in five different languages, including Uruguay and Sign Language,

00:58:11.309 --> 00:58:18.309
and Portuinal, a pigeon language composed of Spanish and Portuguese.

00:58:18.309 --> 00:58:24.309
Like the fertile productive fields where they preach, the harvest in the ministry is great,

00:58:24.309 --> 00:58:30.309
as the 12,000 publishers average 11,000 Bible studies per month.

00:58:30.309 --> 00:58:38.309
In the 1960s, missionaries use rafts to traverse the Sabayati River in order to reach remote territories,

00:58:38.309 --> 00:58:41.309
and the tradition continues to this day.

00:58:41.309 --> 00:58:47.309
Trucks loaded with carts are varied across the river so that publishers can witness

00:58:47.309 --> 00:58:50.309
in the local town squares.

00:58:50.309 --> 00:58:58.309
After a long day of preaching, brothers and sisters enjoy relaxing around campfires, singing and enjoying mate,

00:58:58.309 --> 00:59:05.309
a traditional herbal drink made with yerba that pairs well with tortas fritas or fried cakes.

00:59:05.309 --> 00:59:12.309
The 30 publishers of the Sabayati congregation and all the brothers and sisters in Uruguay

00:59:12.309 --> 00:59:16.309
send their love and greetings to the worldwide brotherhood.

00:59:16.309 --> 00:59:21.309
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.
