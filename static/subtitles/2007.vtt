00:00:02.319 --> 00:00:06.320
and introduction to the book of Micah.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:12.320
Micah was a prophet from the rural village of Moresheth in Judah.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.320
He foretold that devastation would come upon Israel in Judah.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.320
Micah's familiarity with rural life is seen in the kind of illustrations he used.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.320
He served as a prophet for about 60 years

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.320
during the reigns of Judean kings Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:40.320
And he completed his book in Judah sometime before 717 BCE.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.320
Hosea and Isaiah also recorded their prophecies during that time.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:52.320
Although the destruction of Jerusalem foretold by Micah occurred many years after his death,

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.320
he probably lived to see the destruction of Israel's capital, Samaria.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.320
The book of Micah has seven chapters.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.319
Chapters 1 and 2 disclose the revolt of Israel in Judah.

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:12.319
The injustices committed, including those against women and children.

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:17.319
Jehovah's warning that Samaria will become a heap of ruins.

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:25.319
And God's promise that his people will return to Jerusalem and be gathered together like sheep in the pen.

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:35.730
Chapters 3 to 5 contain Micah's denouncements of the leaders, the prophets and the priests for their wickedness and greed.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:43.730
As a result, Zion will be plowed like a field and Jerusalem will become heaps of ruins.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:52.730
However, Micah also foretells that in the final part of the days, true worship will be elevated above all false religion

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:59.730
and people of all nations will stream to the mountain of the house of Jehovah.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:08.729
Did you know Jehovah inspired Micah to foretell that Bethlehem Epitha would be the birthplace of the Messiah.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.729
This was fulfilled when Jesus was born in that town.

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:15.729
You can find this prophecy at Micah 5 too.

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:24.699
Chapters 6 and 7 highlight the deplorable spiritual condition of the people.

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:36.699
As if conducting a legal case, Jehovah requires his people to exercise justice, to cherish loyalty and to walk in modesty with him.

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:45.210
But merchants ignore God's laws and cheat their brothers with fraudulent weights and scales.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:55.210
Micah also expresses his confidence that Jehovah will hear his pleas for justice and show loyal love toward his people.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:02.210
As you read the book of Micah, notice how Jehovah asks of us only what is reasonable and beneficial,

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:14.210
how Micah trusts Jehovah to carry out judgment against the wicked, and how true worship will be restored to an elevated position by means of God's kingdom.
