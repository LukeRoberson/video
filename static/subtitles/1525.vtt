00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.360
Nick, thanks so much for being willing to come along and answer some questions for us.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.879
Yes, I'm glad to come.

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:10.960
Well, now that we've got you here, the first question I'd like to ask you is,

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.919
what really are these so-called J references?

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:18.160
Well, the J in the J references stands for Jehovah.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.519
And this is mainly a list of Bibles in Hebrew and other languages

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.800
that use the divine name Jehovah in the main text of the Christian Greek scriptures,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.199
or at least some form of the name Jehovah.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.240
And this list began to be compiled by the New World Bible translation committee in the 1940s.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.000
So where would we find a list like that now?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.159
Well, originally there was a list of 21 such references in the 1950 edition of the Christian

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:57.600
Greek scriptures. Then in 1984, 27 such references were included in the reference Bible in English.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.560
And since that time, many more J references have been found.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.840
And now the list includes over 90 such translations and reference works.

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:13.439
And you can find an up-to-date list in Appendix C4 of the reference Bible.

00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:18.079
Very good. So I guess the main question we're interested in asking you is,

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.599
do these J references prove in themselves that the tetragramatham should be in the Christian

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.760
Greek scriptures? Actually no, they don't. I'm sure most of us weren't expecting you to say that.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.879
So can you expand a little bit more please? Well, the New World translation committee did not rely

00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:42.879
on the J references as the basis for their decision to restore the divine name in the Christian

00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:48.239
Greek scriptures. You already discussed the basis for the decision earlier in the broadcast.

00:01:48.879 --> 00:01:55.120
Rather, these J references provide proof that other translators have made similar decisions

00:01:55.599 --> 00:02:02.480
when restoring the divine name to their editions of the Christian Greek scriptures or the so-called

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.519
New Testament. So now you're talking about these other Bible translators. Could you give us

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:13.759
an example of who you're talking about? Well, a number of them were well-known Bible scholars.

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:20.879
For example, 19th century Lutheran theologian Franz Delech is still considered to be a foremost

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:28.080
Bible scholar and a scholar of biblical Hebrew. Delech's translation of the New Testament in Hebrew

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:35.280
was produced in 1877 and it's one of the J references. In fact, it's still one of the best known

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.840
New Testaments in the Hebrew language. In that translation, he discerned when to use Jehovah's

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:49.759
name in places where the Greek text contains the term Kideos or Lord. The New World Bible Translation

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:55.680
Committee studied all those occurrences from his translation as well as the occurrences and

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:03.599
other others of the J references. So how would you summarize what the value is of these J references?

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:09.759
Well, all the J references, including the new ones in the study Bible, represent the view of

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:15.439
translators and scholars who arrived at the same conclusion that the New World Bible translation

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:23.439
committee did, namely that Jesus Christ and the apostles used the name Jehovah in their teaching

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:29.919
and in their writings and this conclusion is reflected in their translation and reference works.

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:36.080
Very interesting. That's fascinating. So if I've got to write then what you're saying is if we go

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:43.280
to Appendix C in C3, there we've got a list of the reasons why the brothers and the New World

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:50.240
Translation Committee decided to put Jehovah's name in certain verses. But then C4 is virtually

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:56.159
a list of other Bible translations where the translators made exactly the same decision.

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:00.400
Is that? That's exactly right. That's good. Well, thank you very much, Nick, for coming along.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.159
We really appreciated hearing those expressions from you. Before you go though, can we ask you,

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:11.840
please, can you take back the love and greetings and an expression of appreciation to all those hard

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.800
working brothers and sisters, they're in translation services? Yes, I'd be happy to. Thank you very
