00:00:00.910 --> 00:02:38.900
We're having a memorial, and you have to come.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.900
It's the most important event.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.900
This invite is for you and your mom.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.900
I can tell you more about it at our study.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.900
Okay, thanks.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:54.310
That's right, Camille.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.310
Okay, let's move on to the next paragraph.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.310
Do you mind reading?

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.310
Okay, sure.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.310
Many people hope for good things to happen.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.310
But they cannot be sure that they're home.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.550
Okay, now it's your turn.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.550
Life was perfect.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.550
Adam and Eve just obeyed Jehovah.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.550
They lost their perfect life and died.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:19.550
Right.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.550
After that, nobody was perfect.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.550
So everyone would grow old and die.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.550
Jesus came to earth and taught everyone about Jehovah.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.550
He gave his life.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:34.550
He died for us.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:35.550
That's right.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.550
So that in the future, nobody will have to die.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.379
Has anybody ever given you a special gift?

00:03:43.379 --> 00:04:00.099
Why do you think they gave it to you?

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:02.099
Because she loved me.

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:03.099
Right.

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.099
Jehovah and Jesus gave us the greatest gift.

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:08.099
It costs a lot.

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.099
But they gave it to us because they love us.

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.099
And I want us to live forever.

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.100
But what about my grandma?

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.100
Their gift is for her too.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.670
There's somebody in the Bible I'd like you to meet.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.670
She's a lot like you.

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.009
Luke chapter 7.

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:37.660
She lived in a city called Nain.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.610
She had a husband and a son.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:05:54.540
Her husband died.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.540
She still had her son to keep her company.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:26.389
But then her son died too.

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:28.389
They both died.

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:31.769
She was already a widow.

00:06:31.769 --> 00:06:34.769
And now she was all alone.

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:41.660
The day of the funeral.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.660
Jesus came to Nain.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:07:28.329
And he saw the widow.

00:07:28.329 --> 00:07:54.569
Young man, I say to you, get up.

00:07:54.569 --> 00:07:56.569
Why do you think Jesus brought him back to life?

00:07:56.569 --> 00:08:01.730
He loved them.

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:05.779
He loves all of us.

00:08:05.779 --> 00:08:07.779
He loves you.

00:08:07.779 --> 00:08:10.779
That's why he died for us.

00:08:10.779 --> 00:08:13.779
The Jehovah brought Jesus back to life.

00:08:13.779 --> 00:08:16.779
Soon, Jesus will resurrect people.

00:08:16.779 --> 00:08:20.779
And because he died for us, we could all live forever.

00:08:20.779 --> 00:08:24.779
It's the greatest gift anyone could give us.

00:08:24.779 --> 00:08:29.779
When we go to the memorial, it's a way to say thank you.

00:08:29.779 --> 00:08:32.779
I hope my mom wants to come too.

00:08:32.779 --> 00:08:42.539
Hi, baby.

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:46.539
Should we get ready for the memorial?

00:08:46.539 --> 00:08:48.539
Oh honey, it was a long day.

00:08:48.539 --> 00:08:49.539
I'm so sorry.

00:08:49.539 --> 00:08:51.539
I don't think we can make it.

00:08:51.539 --> 00:09:01.220
Just see you tonight.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:04.909
Let us know if you need a ride.

00:09:04.909 --> 00:09:05.909
It's Sophia's mom.

00:09:05.909 --> 00:09:10.409
Mom, we can do this.

00:09:10.409 --> 00:09:16.429
Let's do it.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:24.580
Yes, my little princess.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:26.580
I'm glad you're studying the Bible.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.580
Me too.

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:40.580
At this time, we'll have the passing of the wine.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:46.580
As we all go home tonight, think about what Jesus sacrificed

00:09:46.580 --> 00:11:20.740
means to you.

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:27.220
Zoe, turn around.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:41.830
Wait, my baby girl.

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:46.899
What's here now?

00:11:46.899 --> 00:12:03.409
Jehovah has shown love in many ways.

00:12:03.409 --> 00:12:06.409
But when he gave Jesus life for us,

00:12:06.409 --> 00:12:10.409
that was the greatest act of love.
