00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:08.880
Trish and I had the privilege of joining Joel and Lordus Dellinger on branch visits to Mozambique and Angola.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:18.879
Our Mozambique visas were delayed. They would not be available for pickup until January 6th in Washington, D.C. the day before our departure.

00:00:18.879 --> 00:00:25.879
But there was a storm and a power outage on January 6th and the embassy did not open its doors.

00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:33.880
So brother from the legal department was at the embassy early on the morning of January 7th, the date of our departure.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:42.880
He secured the visas in Washington, D.C. caught a train to New York City and handed them to us a half hour before we departed.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:50.640
Well that heightened the excitement at the start of our visit. But now please follow the rest of the story.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:01:02.640
On January 7th, 2015 we first flew by way of Germany and South Africa, landing in Macuto, Mozambique on the east coast of Africa.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.640
For years Mozambique has been one of the most impoverished countries in the world.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:16.969
However, for the last three years its economy grew 7 to 8%.

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:22.969
This was evident in the new construction that was seen on the trip from the airport to the branch.

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:33.969
However, unlike the economy there, our branch visit revealed that the spiritual vibrancy of Jehovah's Witnesses is at an all-time peak.

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:39.969
Last year they crested the 56,000 publisher figure and well beyond.

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:47.219
From the minute we entered the gate we felt the radiant welcome of this Bethel family.

00:01:48.219 --> 00:02:00.170
It didn't take long for Trisha and Lordis to adapt to the joyous Mozambique and spirit.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:08.169
A branch expansion project is in its early stages. It will include a 30 room residence building.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:22.169
And we would like all of you future warwick residents to note that the building will have an unobstructed view, not of a small little lake, but of the magnificent Indian Ocean.

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:33.169
Since there are currently about 170 at the branch, some Bethel family members and construction servants live in temporary quarters on site.

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:40.169
The branch is also renting one half of a large house across the road from the entrance to the branch.

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:49.169
And behind the branch they've purchased a portion of a apartment building, shown here with newly painted blue trim for additional housing.

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:56.169
Of course the purpose for the expanded branch facility is in support of the all-important preaching work.

00:02:56.169 --> 00:03:07.060
The use of public witnessing carts has become popular in the larger cities such as Maputo.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:21.590
During the branch visit there was heavy flooding in northern Mozambique. Bridges were destroyed.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:32.889
This isolated a major portion of the population in that region. 74 homes of our brothers were destroyed.

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:40.580
Other homes of our brothers were flooded with several feet of water and mud.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:48.580
Trucks were used to carry over 20 tons of relief supplies as far as the roads would allow.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:55.580
Truck load after truck load was unloaded at this location in Moorambella.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:03.580
The branch rented a helicopter and it made 30 trips to five different Kingdom Hall locations.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.580
Delivering supplies to our needy brothers and sisters.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.580
They were very appreciative of the immediate response to their plight.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:24.800
Our meeting with 56 missionaries was introduced by some children from one of the local congregations.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:49.160
Afterward a special meal was prepared for the missionaries and the Bethel family.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.160
Brother Dillinger was the chairman.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.160
What captured the attention of this Bethel family?

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:06.120
They were focused on some cultural entertainment on stage.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:25.810
The program ended with what has now become a common practice in our gatherings.

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.810
On Sunday a special meeting was held at the Matola Assembly Hall.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.810
The open sighted hall seats about 3,000.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.810
However, almost 18,000 were in attendance.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:44.810
With most sitting on the ground under trees with loudspeakers connecting them through the program.

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:52.220
All too soon it was time to leave the Children of God in Mozambique.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:58.220
On January 20th the four of us flew to Lawanda Angola for the branch visit to that country.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.220
It is a sprawling city of well over 5 million people.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.220
There are modern looking apartment buildings.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.220
However, the majority live in less desirable conditions.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:19.220
But even if one does not read Portuguese, there is no question that this is our JW.org branch property.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:30.759
It is a very beautiful Bethel facility and has a kingdom hall that local congregations use.

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:37.759
However, it is also used for the Bethel families Monday evening spiritual programs.

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:47.759
This branch supports a growing number of publishers, going well over the 100,000 mark in 2014.

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:56.759
And they conduct over 450,000 Bible studies, averaging over four studies per publisher.

00:06:56.759 --> 00:07:09.170
And an interesting phenomenon is that half of those Bible studies are with children and teenagers whose parents are not personally interested in the truth.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:17.170
These are some of the Bible students in one congregation who have arrived early for the meeting, yes, without their parents.

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:26.170
And amazingly, the vast majority of these dedicate their lives to Jehovah and serve faithfully on into adulthood.

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:39.509
In fact, this is a picture of members of the Bethel family who came from that very background, including one member of the branch committee.

00:07:39.509 --> 00:07:45.509
The local Angolans are mild tempered and somewhat reserved or shy by nature.

00:07:45.509 --> 00:07:51.509
So early in the visit, we arranged for a meet and greet evening.

00:07:51.509 --> 00:08:00.509
We invited the entire branch family to come, even if just for a few minutes before leaving for their congregation meetings.

00:08:00.509 --> 00:08:07.509
Brother Mancoca, a dearly beloved 88-year-old member of the branch committee joined the gathering.

00:08:07.509 --> 00:08:16.509
During the years when our work was under ban, he was in and out of prison five times, with a total of 18 years in prison.

00:08:17.509 --> 00:08:20.509
Well, all bonded and had a lovely time together.

00:08:20.509 --> 00:08:24.509
Enthusiasm for the visit was running high.

00:08:24.509 --> 00:08:34.509
For the rest of our time there, the dolingers and flow deans were inundated with offers of hospitality with a wonderful Angola Bethel family.

00:08:34.509 --> 00:08:39.509
Of course, the primary work on every continent is the preaching of the good news of the kingdom.

00:08:40.509 --> 00:08:49.509
Trish and I had the pleasure of joining a missionary couple, now serving at the branch, at a meeting for service in a witness family's humble home.

00:08:49.509 --> 00:08:56.509
This was our service group, doing the very same thing that you regularly do in your congregation territory.

00:08:56.509 --> 00:08:59.509
And then it was off to the field.

00:08:59.509 --> 00:09:15.879
I was happy that we found a young man who spoke English and had a thirst for Bible truth.

00:09:16.879 --> 00:09:24.879
It was then off to another part of the territory to conduct a few of those 450,000 Bible studies.

00:09:24.879 --> 00:09:30.879
This young man is studying in the God's love book and continues to make fine progress.

00:09:30.879 --> 00:09:38.879
Well, here to an Angola, we had a meeting with some of the happy, hardworking missionaries scattered throughout the country.

00:09:38.879 --> 00:09:41.879
But the big event was on Sunday.

00:09:41.879 --> 00:09:48.879
This was the largest single gathering of Jehovah's Witnesses in Angola's history.

00:09:48.879 --> 00:09:53.879
Over 41,000 packed out this large outdoor venue.

00:09:53.879 --> 00:10:00.879
Another 11,500 were tied in in their large open-sided assembly hall.

00:10:00.879 --> 00:10:07.879
And recordings were made for indigenous language publishers to view on the following weekend.

00:10:07.879 --> 00:10:12.879
Interestingly, when they first approached the management, asking to use this facility,

00:10:12.879 --> 00:10:18.879
the manager did not feel it would be appropriate to have a religious event in a soccer stadium.

00:10:18.879 --> 00:10:25.879
However, simultaneously they had made the same request to the minister of youth and sports.

00:10:25.879 --> 00:10:31.879
He agreed with a request and asked permission of the vice president of Angola.

00:10:31.879 --> 00:10:34.879
The manager agreed to rent the stadium.

00:10:34.879 --> 00:10:42.879
At the conclusion of the program, he came down immediately to tell us how excited he was to have Jehovah's Witnesses at the stadium.

00:10:42.879 --> 00:10:50.879
For 20 minutes, he told us how impressed he was with the beautiful people and their exemplary behavior.

00:10:50.879 --> 00:10:57.879
But he also actually quoted from our talks, explaining how practical and beneficial it was for all,

00:10:57.879 --> 00:11:02.879
but especially for the many young ones in attendance.

00:11:02.879 --> 00:11:09.879
We are quite confident this stadium will be used on future occasions by Jehovah's people.

00:11:09.879 --> 00:11:12.879
We very much enjoyed our visit to Angola.

00:11:12.879 --> 00:11:44.559
But in particular, seeing evidence of our spiritual paradise was the true thrill of the visit.

00:11:44.559 --> 00:11:49.559
At the conclusion of our branch visit, the entire Bethel family came down to see us off.

00:11:49.559 --> 00:11:53.559
They sang more songs to wish us farewell.

00:11:54.559 --> 00:11:58.559
In fact, it was as if they couldn't let Jehovah's.

00:11:58.559 --> 00:12:01.559
The feeling was mutual.
