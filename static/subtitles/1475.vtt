00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:14.849
As recorded at Luke 6 and verse 38, Jesus encouraged His followers to practice giving.

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.089
Your generous gifts of time, energy and financial resources have shown that you take this encouragement

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:22.250
to heart.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.489
You have made a practice of giving by continuing to look for ways you can support one another,

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:30.530
both locally and globally.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.770
The governing body has asked me to convey to you their sincere appreciation for your practice

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.049
of giving.

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:44.369
Your kindness contributes to the spirit that Jesus goes on to describe at Luke 6, 38.

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:47.369
Practice giving and people will give to you.

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:54.170
They will pour into your laps a fine measure, press down, shake it together and overflowing.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.210
Forward the measure that you are measuring out, they will measure out to you in return.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.850
And if you feel your contributions are small.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.170
Never forget that every one of your acts of generosity contributes to a ripple effect that

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.450
goes from person to person and promotes generosity throughout our entire brotherhood.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.650
In the following video, notice some examples of how your donations were used to help our

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:27.090
brothers and sisters recently, and how those same ones were then motivated to practice

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.180
giving themselves.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.739
I am deeply grateful for the valuable help I receive from the videos for the midweek

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:39.700
meetings.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.060
These have helped me to make simpler presentations in many times to find just the right scripture

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.540
to answer a certain question.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.420
They have also helped me to make better use of the videos in the ministry.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.900
I feel happy and very cared for by Jehovah who gives us what we need and in the best

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.780
way.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.260
And I am also aware that to have all these beautiful things resources are needed, resources

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.099
to continue producing videos that teach us and that move us so much.

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:18.080
So I am determined to continue planning my donations so that I can contribute and show

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.370
my gratitude to Jehovah for the wonderful work they do.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.090
I have enjoyed life at Bethel for almost 60 years and I have lived in various different

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.330
buildings.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.810
The needs of the work were cared for at the previous branch for more than 30 years.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.330
It was very nice and I experienced a certain nostalgia when I left it.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.330
Now we have something that we would never even have imagined when we started talking about

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.370
a new branch.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:57.889
It is really comfortable, beautiful, functional and worthy of the God we represent.

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:05.490
Today I thank our loving Heavenly Father Jehovah for this new branch and I do not forget

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.449
to thank the brothers for their generous contributions.

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:16.169
This reminds me that I also have to make my own donations just as every other member of

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:17.969
the Bethel family does.

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:24.409
I am very happy and very grateful to Jehovah for allowing me to enjoy this beautiful

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:25.409
provision.

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:39.210
I work with the Bulu translation sim in Ibaloa in the south of Cameroon.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:44.810
Voluntary donations help to cover the basic needs of translators such as food, offices,

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.889
accommodations and transportation.

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:52.330
Also, thanks to these donations, we are happy to have received the enjoy life forever

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.530
book in Bulu.

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.050
There is no longer have to translate the material for their students.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:04.449
With the book in Bulu, they can go straight to the point which makes the study more interesting.

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:09.449
Knowing that my donations help to realize such projects, not only for the Bulu language

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:14.810
but for the many other languages Jehovah's organization translates into is an amazing

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:15.810
privilege.

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:31.529
When the towel volcano erupted, it had a very big effect on me personally and for my

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:41.899
part as a wife and a mother of three, it was truly difficult for me to face.

00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:46.899
Jehovah provided for our needs by means of the brothers.

00:04:46.899 --> 00:04:54.259
This truly brought us joy and happiness, so we never felt that we were lacking anything.

00:04:54.259 --> 00:05:00.779
That was what encouraged us to also help our brothers by giving our time and energy

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:04.720
especially to those in need.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:10.800
Whether it is a little or a lot, when Jehovah sees that it comes from our heart, he will

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.459
surely value it.

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:19.139
It is heartwarming to see the practice of giving that is evident throughout Jehovah's

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:21.220
organization.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:27.699
Your ongoing contributions, regardless of the size or method, all contribute to the growth

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:29.699
and unity of our brotherhood.

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:35.180
This pattern of giving is part of our worship and brings honor to our Heavenly Father.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:41.019
Despite challenging circumstances, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters,

00:05:41.019 --> 00:05:46.819
and even economic uncertainty, you have been overwhelmingly generous.

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:52.579
Jehovah certainly takes note of your generous spirit and we do as well.

00:05:52.579 --> 00:05:56.860
It is our prayer that Jehovah continues to bless your practice of giving with a fine

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:02.740
measure pressed down, shaken together, and overflowing.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.339
Thank you for all you have done and continue to do.
