00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:05.860
These are challenging times, aren't they?

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.419
Think of the challenges this pandemic has created.

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:16.260
It has closed down businesses, delayed school openings, postponed sporting events and more,

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.500
but it has not stopped the flow of spiritual food.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.620
Jesus knew long ago that his followers would find themselves in the time of the end, facing

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.460
the most distressing period in human history.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.579
And he assured them that through a faithful slave, they would receive food at the proper

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:40.659
time, which would give them hope and strengthen them to endure.

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:45.380
True, we've had to adjust how we prepare and serve the spiritual food.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.500
However, we've continued to receive the watch, share, and awake magazines, meeting

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.939
workbooks, new original songs and videos, an entire convention program, and even the release

00:00:56.939 --> 00:01:01.619
of the New World translation in more languages.

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:09.180
This is exactly what Jehovah promised he would provide, as stated at Isaiah 65 and verse

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.180
13.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.980
Therefore, this is what the sovereign Lord Jehovah says.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.500
Look, my servants will eat, but you will go hungry.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.299
Look, my servants will drink, but you will go thirsty.

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:33.540
Look, my servants will rejoice, but you will suffer shame.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.060
Those words aren't just a reassurance, they're a promise.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.980
Despite all the chaos in the world around us, we will have the spiritual food that we need

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.459
to stay strong.

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:51.459
So you might wonder, what adjustments has the governing body made to provide spiritual

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:56.219
food at the proper time, despite the pandemic?

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.180
How have we seen Jehovah's blessing on these adjustments?

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:07.180
And on a personal level, what can each one of us do to show our appreciation for these

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.530
provisions?

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.289
Restrictions and lockdowns haven't stopped the work of writing and publishing spiritually

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:17.650
upbuilding food.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.610
One example of this is the recent update to the study edition of the New World Translation

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.770
of the Holy Scriptures.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:33.330
Ideas and Ephesians are now available in English, with over 340 new study notes, a video,

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.370
media gallery items, and new articles in the appendix.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.310
Now how about JW.org website?

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.169
The brothers have been hard at work there too.

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:50.969
Articles such as, what does the Bible say about pandemics?

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:55.729
And how to deal with isolation have been added?

00:02:55.729 --> 00:03:01.889
Historical is about distance learning, domestic abuse, and alcohol consumption have also been

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:03.090
added.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.689
The very issues that are on many people's minds right now.

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:14.449
How has the pandemic affected the production of our various video projects?

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:20.250
As you can imagine, with Bethel facilities on lockdown and with physical distancing measures

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.370
in place, we've had to rethink how videos can be safely produced.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.650
In the following video report, Brother Bob Batco, a member of the Central America Branch

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:39.020
Committee, explains adjustments the regional video team has made.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.939
To keep the cameras rolling, the regional video team hosted here at the branch had

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:46.340
to overcome some pretty big challenges.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.580
One of them was casting.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:54.199
We couldn't invite local brothers and sisters to come in to play roles, nor could the

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:58.099
Bethel team go out to shoot on location.

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:04.060
So what did it require, adapting to the local circumstances?

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.460
That meant shooting on Bethel property with Bethel personnel.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:16.620
Now that may seem limiting, but they found solutions, the green screen.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:25.600
That meant that they could shoot in studio and the actor could virtually be anywhere.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.639
When working on a set here, rigorous safety precautions need to be taken.

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:35.000
Casting crew members get their temperature checked at the beginning, and the end of each

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.120
day, and everyone, everyone wears face masks, including the actors, unless they're being

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.120
filmed.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:49.360
The actors maintain physical distancing, win with anyone other than their mate or roommate.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.560
To minimize contact with a hair and makeup team, they've taken advantage of video conferencing.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.779
So they would teach the wives how to put beards on their husbands in their Bethel rooms.

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:07.519
This way only touch ups need to be done on set, and even then, personal protective equipment

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:09.120
is used.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.920
And everything is disinfected before and after each session.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:19.279
In doing all of this, there was a wonderful spirit of unity.

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:24.959
During the lockdown, no commuters have been able to come in, so many from other Bethel

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.279
departments have been made available to help with the work.

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:36.040
Some are helping on the production team, others by sewing wardrobes, building sets, and

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.800
nobody went hungry, all the meals were provided.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:47.000
In all of this, it's obvious that Jehovah bless not just these arrangements, but also

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.399
the governing body, so that they could provide the much needed spiritual food right on time.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:03.920
As you can see, we've had to adjust many aspects of video production, and we're grateful

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.839
for the hard work of all involved.

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:12.480
In fact, all of our video teams, including the ones at World Headquarters, are taking

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:18.680
similar steps to keep production going while remaining safe.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.120
But do you see the point?

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:26.879
The menu of spiritual food prepared well before the pandemic will be presented just as

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:28.800
planned.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:34.720
You might say we've had to adjust some of the kitchen utensils and cooking methods, but

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:43.120
the meal itself is unchanged and just as nourishing, so you won't miss a thing.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.800
Another vital part of the process in providing spiritual food to Jehovah's people worldwide

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:54.199
is translation, and that hasn't stopped either.

00:06:54.199 --> 00:07:00.000
Animation teams have been able to continue their work by video conference, and the results

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.480
have been thrilling.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:08.920
For example, since the start of the pandemic, the new world translation has been released

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:15.399
in whole or in part in 19 languages.

00:07:15.399 --> 00:07:20.399
Some of these releases had been planned in conjunction with regional conventions that

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:23.360
were to be held later this year.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:30.279
So when the decision was made to present a global convention program by video, the teaching

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:37.199
committee asks if these newly translated Bibles could be released before the convention began

00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:39.279
in July.

00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:45.879
That way, translators could use the new Bibles when translating the convention program,

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:53.079
and publishers could follow along with all six sessions using their newly released Bibles.

00:07:53.079 --> 00:08:01.360
Well, through a tremendous effort and with Jehovah's blessing, 13 Bibles were released

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:08.199
in digital format as special meetings in the weeks leading up to the convention.

00:08:08.199 --> 00:08:13.360
You can imagine how thrilled the brothers were to receive these Bibles in their local

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:18.800
languages just in time for the convention.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:23.800
One of those new translations was in the O'Roma language.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:30.399
In this video report, Brother Delroy Williamson, a member of the Ethiopia Branch Committee,

00:08:30.399 --> 00:08:38.529
describes the challenges that they faced and how they overcame them with Jehovah's help.

00:08:38.529 --> 00:08:43.929
We were very excited to learn that despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the complete new world

00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:48.850
translation would be released digitally in the O'Roma language.

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:53.649
So all congregations in Ethiopia were invited to attend a special meeting which would be

00:08:53.649 --> 00:08:57.409
streamed countrywide over the internet.

00:08:57.409 --> 00:09:03.450
But just five days before the release date, civil unrest broke out in the country, and

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:08.049
due to this, the government shut down the internet.

00:09:08.049 --> 00:09:12.690
Suddenly there was no way to access the program online.

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:16.330
But this is where we really saw Jehovah's hand in matters.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:21.049
When the program was being planned, the branch committee received approval to pre-record

00:09:21.049 --> 00:09:26.690
the release talks and to broadcast the program via satellite.

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:31.490
This will enable the meeting to reach the most distant parts of our branch territory.

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:38.169
Well, that satellite broadcast became the main way for over 12,000 of our brothers

00:09:38.169 --> 00:09:40.929
to view the special meeting.

00:09:40.929 --> 00:09:44.850
And in the areas of the country not covered by the satellite, the brothers listened to

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.610
the program by telephone.

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:52.850
Just two days after the program, internet access was restored and the brothers with an internet

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:59.529
connection downloaded the Bible and then transferred the files to those without internet access.

00:09:59.529 --> 00:10:06.610
It was really face strengthening to see how despite a pandemic, despite unrest, despite

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:14.860
the country being in a state of emergency, our spiritual food supply continued to flow.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:19.820
What a blessing for our Roma-speaking brothers and sisters.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:26.259
Besides new Bibles, our translation teams have also been busy with other projects.

00:10:26.259 --> 00:10:31.860
For example, the 2020 governing body update reports, such as the one you're watching

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:37.980
right now, have been a landmark in simultaneous communication.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:44.259
The second report was uploaded in about 400 languages simultaneously.

00:10:44.259 --> 00:10:50.580
That's the largest simultaneous multi-language video release in our history.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:56.340
And this turned out to be a dry run for an even bigger task.

00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:05.220
The first day of the 2020 Always Rejoice Convention was also uploaded in about 400 languages

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:09.620
within 24 hours of English.

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:17.820
Preparing translations for every talk was a massive effort on a very tight schedule.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:23.259
Many local brothers used their own resources to assist and worked tirelessly to provide

00:11:23.259 --> 00:11:26.139
quality translations.

00:11:26.139 --> 00:11:32.980
In many cases, the dubbing of the talks was so well-sinked that some brothers actually

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:37.299
thought the talks were being delivered in their language.

00:11:37.299 --> 00:11:44.029
Here's just one example from Kenya, in the Kikamba language.

00:11:44.029 --> 00:11:47.789
I learned your fluke awa kukuyama kuy.

00:11:47.789 --> 00:11:52.230
Why we were at the local kongrui si kui kanehsa?

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:04.230
Now don't be fooled.

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:08.149
Brother Shaffer hasn't mastered Kikamba.

00:12:08.149 --> 00:12:13.950
But thanks to the skills of our translation team, the results were convincing enough for

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:20.190
some to say, it's so wonderful these brothers learned our language.

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:25.830
Well regarding all this work being done in writing, video production, translation and

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:34.509
more, we might ask, how has all this been possible, especially now?

00:12:34.509 --> 00:12:41.710
We find the answer at Zechariah chapter 4 and verse 6.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:51.669
Not by a military force nor by power, but by my spirit says Jehovah of armies.

00:12:51.669 --> 00:12:57.389
None of this would be possible without Jehovah's Holy Spirit.

00:12:57.389 --> 00:13:02.090
Have them we all show appreciation for the way we're being spiritually fed during this

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:04.830
difficult time?

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:07.590
Consider three ways.

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:14.509
First and foremost, take full advantage of the spiritual banquet that Jehovah is providing.

00:13:14.509 --> 00:13:21.509
Read the Bible every day and to the extent that you can, read each new magazine and publication

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:26.909
and watch each new video available in your language.

00:13:26.909 --> 00:13:33.509
Not long ago, receiving our spiritual food digitally would have been hard to even imagine.

00:13:33.509 --> 00:13:40.070
And yet now, we probably wonder how we'd be coping with this pandemic without tools like

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:42.590
JW Library.

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:49.149
Jehovah has been preparing us over the years to be ready for something like this.

00:13:49.149 --> 00:13:53.629
And the older ones in our congregation have gotten more comfortable with their electronic

00:13:53.629 --> 00:13:56.070
devices.

00:13:56.070 --> 00:14:02.029
Even though some of our brothers have very limited access to this technology, just think

00:14:02.029 --> 00:14:08.549
about how much these tools are helping us as an organization to study, share and distribute

00:14:08.549 --> 00:14:13.590
God's Word in the face of this crisis.

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:19.070
Keeping ourselves well fed spiritually will help us to focus our minds on what Paul

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:25.590
described at Philippians chapter 4 and verse 8.

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:32.629
Whatever things are of serious concern, whatever things are righteous, whatever things are

00:14:32.629 --> 00:14:39.830
chased, whatever things are lovable, whatever things are well spoken of, whatever things

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:48.990
are virtuous and whatever things are praiseworthy, continue considering these things.

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:56.629
Second, we can show our appreciation by praying for those working hard to support the Kingdom

00:14:56.629 --> 00:15:02.590
work at world headquarters and in the branches and remote translation offices around the

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:04.470
world.

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:09.710
Many Bethel families have been on lockdown for over five months.

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:15.269
Our Bethel family members have willingly obeyed the direction given in order to protect

00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:19.750
the Kingdom work and the flow of spiritual food.

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:25.750
We are very proud of them and truly appreciate their cooperation as well as that of their

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:28.950
families and congregations.

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:34.590
Third, we can be generous with our spiritual food.

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:40.029
Have a full share in preaching and teaching despite the limitations we are facing right

00:15:40.029 --> 00:15:42.409
now.

00:15:42.409 --> 00:15:48.649
Also, if you find a verse you love in your Bible reading or a point that stands out in an

00:15:48.649 --> 00:15:55.289
article or video, don't keep it to yourself, share the good things Jehovah has given us

00:15:55.289 --> 00:15:59.049
with your brothers and sisters.

00:15:59.049 --> 00:16:04.090
One aspect of our spiritual food is our songs.

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:09.129
While you may have missed singing together at your meetings or the convention, our brothers

00:16:09.129 --> 00:16:15.409
and sisters are still finding ways to sing together virtually.

00:16:15.409 --> 00:16:22.129
The following video clip of the song, Our Joy Eternally, was made by brothers and sisters

00:16:22.129 --> 00:16:27.570
serving as remote volunteers in France while they were under lockdown.

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:34.649
Each person recorded his or her part individually and then they were edited together to create

Dear brothers and sisters, please be assured of the warm love of the governing body

00:18:23.319 --> 00:18:26.559
and our prayers in your behalf.
