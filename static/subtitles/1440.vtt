00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:07.230
When my wife and I visit different branches on various speaking assignments, what encourages

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:14.470
us the most is seeing how our brothers and sisters' worldwide remain loyal to Jehovah.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:19.309
Brother Mark Duman and his wife went on such a trip recently and came back with many

00:00:19.309 --> 00:00:21.710
fine experiences.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:29.489
You probably remember Brother Numea as the co-anchor in the December 2014 monthly program.

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:35.130
As a headquarters representative, Brother Numea had the privilege of visiting three branches

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:47.200
in Africa.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.679
Recently, Sister Numea and I had the privilege of joining Brother and Sister Maray in visiting

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:55.840
three countries in East Africa.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:02.200
Our first stop was Tanzania, where we visited the remote translation office which is located

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.280
in Dar Salam.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.840
There are 41 devoted brothers and sisters working at this office assisting with Swahili

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.680
translation.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.719
We also had the opportunity to join the brothers in the ministry and to witness firsthand their

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:22.010
zeal for the truth.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.609
Many recall Clinton, Wendy, Winkleman.

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:30.969
They served at Patterson before being assigned to Tanzania as Besselites in Foreign Service.

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:36.010
Here you'll notice Wendy is conducting a Bible study with a woman on the right, but woman

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:43.349
on the left is also her Bible student that came early and is waiting her turn.

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:48.659
The people in Tanzania are hungry for the truth.

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.980
The metropolitan witnessing is now being done in Dar Salam.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:02:00.060
Since it began nine months ago, over 150,000 pieces of literature have been taken.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.500
Hundreds of requests for Bible studies have been made and several people have begun attending

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.099
meetings and are making spiritual progress.

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:14.539
In the village areas of Tanzania, people are also receiving a witness, but from their

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:22.219
mobile devices, they are able to get in contact with their students, direct them to the website,

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:28.539
and show them videos.

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:34.979
During our visit, the brothers arranged for a special meeting connecting 19 other locations

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:40.460
and they had a combined attendance of over 18,500.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.699
This is Tanzania's broadcasting department.

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:49.219
They utilized a simple router to connect all 18,000 friends, and if that for some reason

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:52.259
didn't connect, they had a B plan.

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:57.900
Each location had its own designated cell phone, and the brothers on standby ready to connect

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.699
each one.

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:06.180
Thanks to these young brothers, we had smooth connections the entire program.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.270
On to our next stop, Kenya.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.849
The patty and I, it was like coming home.

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:22.490
30 years later, some things still haven't changed, patty's still making great coffee.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.090
When we arrived as missionaries, Kenya had about 3,000 publishers.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.530
Now they have over 27,000.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.490
Shella is one of the many young ones we met when we were in the circuit work.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.210
Now, he is serving as a translator in the RTO.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:44.250
This family adopted us when we were new missionaries and helped us learn Swahili.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:51.340
The little girl on the bike is now serving at Bethel along with her husband.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.300
We were so happy to see many of these young ones grow up into spiritual men and women.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.419
The parents of these ones really took to heart the importance of training their children,

00:04:02.419 --> 00:07:08.079
and we can see the good results that came from it.

00:07:08.079 --> 00:07:14.199
The total attendance for the special program in Kenya was over 35,000, and it was streamed

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:22.250
to 25 locations, including Sudan.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.970
On to our next stop, Malawi.

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:32.079
Branch office is located in Lillongui.

00:07:32.079 --> 00:07:43.699
The attendance for the special meeting was 43,479 from seven different locations.

00:07:43.699 --> 00:07:48.740
Not long ago, our Bethel family listened to a branch report from Malawi about unity

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.540
players.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:55.379
They have a battery that can be charged by a solar panel or a hand crank.

00:07:55.379 --> 00:08:00.420
Traveling overseas, gallon load new songs and videos onto a memory stick.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:05.220
From there, they connect the memory stick to the unity player, which acts as a sound system

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.959
for playing the new songs.

00:08:09.959 --> 00:08:15.079
The player also has a microphone, which helps when they are teaching the congregation.

00:08:15.079 --> 00:08:19.519
When they want to show one of our videos with the projector, they connect the memory stick

00:08:19.519 --> 00:08:23.839
in the projector and the unity player for sound.

00:08:23.839 --> 00:08:29.360
This wonderful provision from Jehovah's organization has helped so many of our dear brothers

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.720
and sisters to really benefit even in remote areas.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:40.340
They get to know more of their international brotherhood and the governing body.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:47.100
The brothers are keen on helping as many as possible to obtain and practice the new songs.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:51.700
The brothers take out their cell phones and turn on the Bluetooth setting.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:56.299
They share the music via Bluetooth from one brother's phone to another brother's phone

00:08:56.299 --> 00:09:02.379
in just a short time the whole congregation has the new music on their phones.

00:09:02.379 --> 00:09:10.490
They just can't wait to get home and start learning and singing the new songs.

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:15.730
A portion of our visit was spent strengthening and encouraging translation teams.

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:22.250
The Marei was particularly pleased to speak with all four of the remote translation offices.

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:28.889
Even though the internet is limited, people are still benefiting from JW.org in Malawi.

00:09:28.889 --> 00:09:37.029
The brothers have traveled out to Nomuera to do recordings for the Yao language.

00:09:37.029 --> 00:09:42.710
While the RTO is under construction, the audio video department will set up a mobile studio

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:45.940
in the local kingdom hall.

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:52.779
Yao is mainly a spoken language, so the brothers download recordings or videos on a memory stick

00:09:52.779 --> 00:09:57.700
and take it in the field service.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:02.059
So the brothers play the audio publication for the householder on their own radio while

00:10:02.059 --> 00:10:04.779
they follow along in the printed publication.

00:10:09.679 --> 00:10:15.679
A big lesson we learned during our visit is that it's not about technology, it's not

00:10:15.679 --> 00:10:19.919
about possessions, it's all about people.

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:23.559
And their willing spirit that is getting the work done.

00:10:23.559 --> 00:10:27.440
And there is so much work yet to do in the lands we visited.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:33.240
It is our prayer that the sharp sickle in the hand of Christ continue to reap the people

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.120
of Tanzania, Kenya and Malawi.
