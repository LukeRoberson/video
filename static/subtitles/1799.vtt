00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:05.299
Brother John Foster has served as a member of the United States

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.300
Bethel family for more than 50 years,

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.300
but one day something unexpected happened

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.019
that changed his life.

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:25.019
I was baptized in 1958 and January the 11th

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.019
at a high school in Detroit.

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:36.020
The ministry was very important to me because I meant the lives of individuals

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:44.020
and so I considered it a priority to go out into the ministry.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.020
I applied for Bethel in 1962 as a District Convention

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:57.020
and I arrived there on my birthday in December of 28, 1962.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.020
I came to Bethel and I was determined to use my strength

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.019
the best way possible.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:12.019
And so I worked very hard to produce the publications

00:01:12.019 --> 00:01:18.019
because I realized that it meant lives of individuals.

00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:23.019
It was a very good time for me because I could

00:01:23.019 --> 00:01:30.019
give my all to Jehovah at any young age when I was strong

00:01:30.019 --> 00:01:34.019
and could carry out more.

00:01:34.019 --> 00:01:39.689
In 2006 everything changed.

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.689
I was in a Jehovah car accident.

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:47.689
We were on our way to the congregation

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.689
and we hit a tree.

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:59.260
I got a broken neck and a broken leg

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.260
and unfortunately the driver did not survive.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:11.259
The others that were in the car didn't receive injuries as severe.

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:15.259
I was in the coma for three weeks.

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:19.259
When I woke up, I dealt with the pain of my recovery

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:23.259
by witnessing to people.

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:29.259
I wanted to place literature with the people in the hospital

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:34.259
and almost seem like an unworked feel.

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:39.259
I placed a Bible teachbook with my surgeon

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:44.259
and I told him that you saved my life

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:48.659
so I want to save your life.

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:51.659
If I was concerned after the accident

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:56.659
whether Bethel would be able to use me in a meaningful way

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:00.659
and not simply tolerate me,

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:04.659
the responsibilities that I have now

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:12.659
are to work with the books that have been printed from all over the world

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:17.659
and we put them in archives as examples

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:21.659
of the printing that have been done.

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.659
Another job I have once in a while

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:27.659
is to talk to departments

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:33.550
and give them encouraging talks.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.550
I assume that I would heal

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.550
and be better than I am now

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.550
and be able to return to what I used to do

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.550
when I was wrong in that.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.550
I feel that I'm doing the best I can

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.550
so I feel comfortable.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.550
I wish I could do more

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.550
but I just don't have the ability to do more

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.550
and so I met peace with Jehovah.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.550
I know that he understands my situation

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.550
and I'm doing the best I can

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:19.550
and that any real improvement

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.550
is going to come from life in a new system of things.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.550
So that's where my hope is

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.550
that I'll make it to the new system of things

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.550
and that I'll yet see

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.550
and improve my own well-perfect health really.
