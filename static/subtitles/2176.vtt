00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:12.830
In what ways have you seen people treat others who are different from them?

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:20.829
When I was at school, a common viewpoint of my schoolmates was that you should be accepting of whatever lifestyle someone chooses to lead.

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:25.829
Teachers would encourage us to support those with different sexual orientations.

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:32.810
In my final year of high school, a new teacher arrived.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:41.899
He was different. He came from the capital and I lived in a small town.

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.899
He had spent many years at university and didn't believe in God.

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.899
On social media, it was very common to see extreme viewpoints about different lifestyles.

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.789
I often saw comments attacking others for their lifestyles.

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:07.829
The teacher had a very different personality. He seemed to like attacking the students and putting them on the spot.

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:16.829
He would ask probing questions about controversial topics in class and even made comments to the class like the people from here aren't made for learning.

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:25.829
Of course, the students didn't react very well. Many of them refused to attend his classes or if they did, they refused to speak to him during the class.

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:29.829
I remember them saying, I'm not going to talk with that atheist.

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:36.829
I remember that some classmates would say to me, don't Jehovah's Witnesses hate gay people?

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:49.650
It seemed like many students assumed that we must have an extreme viewpoint and that we would completely reject those who don't conform to our beliefs.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.650
What helped you get the Bible's viewpoint?

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.930
My parents always helped me to have a balanced viewpoint.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:06.930
As I was growing up, they helped me understand that even though we completely reject certain conduct, we don't hate the person who practices it.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:17.930
I learned a lot from my mom's example. She used to work at a beauty salon and I saw how she was always kind to others she worked with, regardless of their sexual orientation.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.930
I thought of Jesus' example, how he shared the message with everyone, no matter their thinking or background.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.930
Jesus took the time to talk with them, no matter who they were or what others thought of them.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:39.930
I love the scripture at Matthew 5.45, where it says that Jehovah makes the sunshine and the rainfall on all people.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.930
This is an expression of his love, to provide what each person needs, no matter who they are.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:55.930
As I was thinking about Jesus' example, I remembered his words recorded at Matthew, where he tells us that, what you want men to do to you, you also must do to them.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.930
This helped me to think about how I should act around my teacher.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.930
It made me treat him differently.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:13.930
I mean, if Jehovah, the Almighty God, is kind, good, and respectful toward all, why shouldn't I be?

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.930
And that would include those whose conduct I don't agree with.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:27.580
Jehovah has given us the best way to show our love for our neighbor by helping them to come to know him.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.580
What has been the outcome of applying Bible principles?

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.580
At my previous job, I worked at a hotel where there was a waiter who was gay.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.580
Some of his coworkers would treat him poorly.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.580
So I made sure I didn't join in with them and treated him like I would anyone else.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.580
I was able to have conversations with my teacher about the Bible and share scriptures with him.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.580
He was impressed by what the Bible had to say on scientific matters and said he wanted to find out more.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:02.580
One day, the waiter came up to me and thanked me for being different from the others in the way I treated him.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.580
Even some of the other waiters asked me why I was like that.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:14.580
This opened up the opportunity to explain that I tried to apply Bible principles in my life, including how I treat others.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.579
There was a noticeable change in the teacher as the school year went on.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:25.579
He told me that he was impressed by my conduct and because I had spoken with him when none of the other students would.

00:04:25.579 --> 00:04:30.579
His classes became so much better because he started to be nicer to his students.

00:04:30.579 --> 00:04:33.579
Little by little, the students returned to class.

00:04:33.579 --> 00:04:38.579
And by the end of the year, it had become one of the classes that we enjoyed the most.

00:04:38.579 --> 00:04:47.579
When I think about the way that Jehovah treats people and how he gives everyone a chance to learn about him, I'm drawn to him even more.
