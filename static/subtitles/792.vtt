00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.280
Welcome to this edition of the Inside Story.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:40.280
Today, we will get to know six of the 48 students representing the 156th Class of Gilead.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.280
To my left, I have Sister Hanta Razaf Mandimbi from Madagascar.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.280
Next to Hanta is Adalia and Manny Luna from the United States.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.280
To my far right is Simon and Yoshi Hori from Japan.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.280
And last but not least, we have Brother Marco Caproni from Italy.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.280
Welcome to all six of you.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.280
And we look forward to hearing what you have to share with us today.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.280
Why don't we start by first hearing how long you've been in your respective Bethels

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.280
and what your current assignments are?

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.280
Why don't we start with you, Hanta?

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.280
I've been serving at Madagascar Bethel for 24 years.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.280
Nice.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.280
And currently I'm serving in one of the translation teams there.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.280
Excellent. Adalia.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.280
We are currently serving in the United States branch, Joaquil Complex for about 13 years.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.280
And my assignment is actually a split assignment between food service and health care department.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.280
Okay, very good. Manny.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.280
And I, along with Adalia, have been serving at the United States branch for about 13 years.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.280
And I currently work with the service department.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.280
Very good.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.280
Let's switch over to you, Simon, please.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.280
I have been in the Japan branch for 16 years.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.280
And my assignment is the computer department.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.280
Okay, very good. And Yoshi?

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.280
And I've been in the Japan branch for six years.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.280
And now I serve in the legal department.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.280
Okay, very good. And please, Marco.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.280
I've been serving an Italy branch in Rome for 18 years.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.280
And actually I'm serving in the public information department.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.280
Excellent. Well, now that we've got a chance to learn a little bit about you,

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.280
let's start off with Simon.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.280
Simon, I understand that you are baptized at 10 years of age.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.280
Yeah.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.280
Can you tell us about what your father did to help you make spiritual progress at such a young age?

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.280
Well, my father was very creative.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.280
Explain.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:57.280
For example, as a family, we enjoyed playing a game, named Bible Golf.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.280
Okay.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.280
It's a simple game.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:10.280
So the winner is whoever can open to a specific Bible verse in the fewest attempt.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.280
So if I can open the verse in the first attempt, it's a hole in one.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.280
All right.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.280
And three attempts, it's a buddy.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.280
Something like this.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.280
And another game I can still remember is Jehovah's Witnesses Game of Life,

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.280
which is a bold game with two circles on it.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.280
And you can start from outside circle, which represents non-witness life.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.280
Non-witness life.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.280
Okay.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:49.280
And if you progress properly, Bible study, and dedication, assembly, or convention,

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.280
then you can enter into inner circle, which represents witness life.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.280
But there is a time limit called Armageddon.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:08.280
So when the alarm goes off, you can enter into paradise if you are in the inner circle.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.280
And it's so much fun because there are also something blocks along the way.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.279
And your father came up with this game.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:19.279
Yes.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.279
Obviously he was very creative.

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.279
Did he do anything else to help you?

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:26.279
Well, the knowledge book came out.

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:32.279
He asked me and my sister if we wanted to get baptized within six months.

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:34.279
And we said yes.

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:40.279
From then on, each morning, he would leave the house, knock on the door,

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:46.279
introduce himself as brother Hori, and conduct a Bible study with us.

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:50.279
And we have to serve tea for him.

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:59.779
Now I understand he wanted to teach us the Bible study is a serious thing in our life.

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:04.779
It's unique, but I was able to get baptized within a year.

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:09.779
Well, obviously it worked because you are with us today.

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:15.779
Well, once you were baptized, was it always smooth sailing for you Simon?

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:18.779
Honestly, no, not always.

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:25.779
As I grew older, I started struggling because I wanted to be exemplarily in congregation,

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:28.779
but I liked computer very much.

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:33.779
So I wanted to be an engineer in an IT company.

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:35.779
It was a big dream, huh?

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:37.779
Yeah, okay.

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:42.779
But eventually, the Timothy drama came out.

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:52.779
And in that drama, the apostle Paul encouraged Timothy not to use his skill in sailing world, but for Jehovah.

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:55.779
That was the turning point for me.

00:05:55.779 --> 00:06:00.779
Instead of pursuing secular work, I started pioneering.

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:02.779
And then I came to love it.

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:06.779
Let's talk to your wife Yoshi for just a moment.

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:13.779
Now Yoshi, you were born in Japan, but I understand that you and your family moved around a bit.

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:15.779
Can you tell us a little bit about that?

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:22.779
Yes, so my father, he wasn't a witness at the time, and his work necessitated that we move around quite a bit.

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:28.779
So I remember I was five when we were living in Osaka in Japan.

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:32.779
Then we moved to London in Britain.

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:35.779
We were there for four years.

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:38.779
And then after that, we all moved to Scotland.

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:41.779
So I lived in Glasgow for five years.

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:45.779
After that, we all moved back to Tokyo.

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:53.779
And later, when I was an adult, I moved on my own to serve where the need was great in Tanzania.

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:55.779
I stayed there for six years.

00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:57.779
I moved back and now we're here.

00:06:57.779 --> 00:07:00.779
And we're happy to have you.

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:05.779
Now you've got to live in some pretty fascinating places over those years.

00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:12.779
What did you learn about yourself and culture from living in those places?

00:07:12.779 --> 00:07:18.779
Well, you know, when I was young, I honestly didn't really appreciate it.

00:07:18.779 --> 00:07:31.779
But now that I've grown older, I feel that it's taught me to understand that there's so many different ways of looking at something in so many different ways of doing something.

00:07:31.779 --> 00:07:34.779
But actually, all of them are really, really good.

00:07:34.779 --> 00:07:39.779
And it's a blessing to have so many different personalities with us.

00:07:39.779 --> 00:07:43.779
And I just love working with these variety of brothers and sisters now.

00:07:43.779 --> 00:07:46.779
Oh, obviously looking back on it, you learned quite a bit.

00:07:46.779 --> 00:07:47.779
Thank you for sharing that.

00:07:47.779 --> 00:07:50.779
Let's switch over to you now, Hanta.

00:07:50.779 --> 00:07:56.779
Now I understand that you were not raised as one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:07:56.779 --> 00:07:59.779
Can you tell us a little bit about your background, please?

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:03.779
I was raised in a religious family.

00:08:03.779 --> 00:08:07.779
We used to go to a Protestant church every week.

00:08:07.779 --> 00:08:11.779
And my siblings and I even attended Sunday school for a while.

00:08:11.779 --> 00:08:21.779
Okay. Now, although your father never became one of Jehovah's Witnesses, how was he instrumental in leading you to the truth?

00:08:21.779 --> 00:08:29.779
My father welcomed anyone who knocked at our door in the name of religion.

00:08:29.779 --> 00:08:34.779
And Jehovah's Witnesses were among these people.

00:08:34.779 --> 00:08:40.779
Every time they stopped by, they would leave magazines, books, brochures.

00:08:40.779 --> 00:08:48.779
What I really appreciate in those publications is God's promise of a paradise Earth.

00:08:48.779 --> 00:08:52.779
I really like the pictures of paradise in those publications.

00:08:52.779 --> 00:09:01.779
So much so that my siblings and I would trace those pictures, paint them, and hang them on the wall.

00:09:01.779 --> 00:09:07.779
Your parents were okay with you re-decorating like this.

00:09:07.779 --> 00:09:13.779
One day our father bought the leaf forever book from the Witnesses.

00:09:13.779 --> 00:09:17.779
It was then that the Bible study was started.

00:09:17.779 --> 00:09:26.779
From the first meeting I attended, I was so impressed by the warm welcome I received that I said to myself,

00:09:26.779 --> 00:09:30.779
I want to belong to these people.

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:36.779
Eventually all my siblings and I, along with our mother, embraced the truth.

00:09:36.779 --> 00:09:42.779
Actually, one of my brothers and I got baptized together on the same day.

00:09:42.779 --> 00:09:44.779
That must have been really special for you.

00:09:44.779 --> 00:09:46.779
Thank you for sharing that with the Santa.

00:09:46.779 --> 00:09:50.779
We'll come back to you. Let's go over to Adalia now.

00:09:50.779 --> 00:09:57.779
Adalia, you were born, raised, and spent your early teenage years in Brooklyn, New York.

00:09:57.779 --> 00:10:01.779
How was that for you growing up around World Headquarters?

00:10:01.779 --> 00:10:04.779
It was a beautiful, positive experience.

00:10:04.779 --> 00:10:09.779
Getting to see self-sacrificing brothers and sisters give all they could to Jehovah

00:10:09.779 --> 00:10:15.779
and also see how happy and excited they were in their service was a beautiful example.

00:10:15.779 --> 00:10:22.779
This helped instill in me goals and really plant seeds and put in me the desire to want to live that same kind of life.

00:10:22.779 --> 00:10:24.779
We could understand that.

00:10:24.779 --> 00:10:29.779
Now eventually, you and your family moved to Florida.

00:10:29.779 --> 00:10:31.779
That's where you met Manny.

00:10:31.779 --> 00:10:34.779
You two were eventually married.

00:10:34.779 --> 00:10:38.779
You should have stayed in Brooklyn, see?

00:10:38.779 --> 00:10:41.779
You met Manny and you two were married.

00:10:41.779 --> 00:10:42.779
What next?

00:10:42.779 --> 00:10:48.779
So shortly after we got married before our first year anniversary, we started regular pioneering.

00:10:48.779 --> 00:10:54.779
Then after that, we were invited to serve with Anita's great in a very rural part of Florida.

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:58.779
The Orange Grove region, very different to what we both grew up.

00:10:58.779 --> 00:11:05.779
We were both used to the city life, but we went to that area and immersed ourselves with the congregation.

00:11:05.779 --> 00:11:09.779
Beautiful, young congregation who worked hard in the ministry

00:11:09.779 --> 00:11:16.779
and we grew to really love those brothers and Jehovah blessed the hard work that was being done in that area.

00:11:16.779 --> 00:11:18.779
How long were you there?

00:11:18.779 --> 00:11:25.779
We were there for ten years and during that time period, that one congregation that we were at actually turned into five congregations.

00:11:25.779 --> 00:11:28.779
Five congregations, over ten years, excellent.

00:11:28.779 --> 00:11:34.779
Now Manny, clearly, yourself and Adalia, you were busy in Jehovah's service.

00:11:34.779 --> 00:11:39.779
Was that the end of the extent of your pursuing theocratic goals?

00:11:39.779 --> 00:11:47.779
No, not at all. Adalia and I made an effort to live a simple life so that we could give all we could to Jehovah without any distractions.

00:11:47.779 --> 00:11:53.779
That allowed us to pioneer, it also allowed us to move to that area where there was greater need.

00:11:53.779 --> 00:12:00.779
But to further make ourselves available, we applied to Bethel several times.

00:12:00.779 --> 00:12:03.779
Okay, that's a little nebulous.

00:12:03.779 --> 00:12:08.779
Several times, how many times did you apply to Bethel?

00:12:08.779 --> 00:12:12.779
It was only twelve times.

00:12:12.779 --> 00:12:18.779
Twelve times. What part of know did you not understand?

00:12:18.779 --> 00:12:20.779
No, please tell us.

00:12:20.779 --> 00:12:26.779
What caused you to keep applying when you weren't receiving a response to come?

00:12:26.779 --> 00:12:31.779
As you can see, certainly, we were very persistent.

00:12:31.779 --> 00:12:36.779
We wanted to keep our options open and allowed Jehovah to decide where we would serve.

00:12:36.779 --> 00:12:46.779
But you know when we looked back at it, we realized that applying to Bethel all those times and not getting accepted was just simply because it wasn't our time.

00:12:46.779 --> 00:12:49.779
What do you mean by that? Was it your time?

00:12:49.779 --> 00:12:54.779
There we were in our assignment, but wanting to be at Bethel.

00:12:54.779 --> 00:13:02.779
Jehovah knew we had a lot to learn and he allowed that assignment to give us the training that we needed.

00:13:02.779 --> 00:13:13.779
And those twelve applications or those twelve times that we applied taught us a lot, taught us patience, taught us to wait on Jehovah, taught us appreciation.

00:13:13.779 --> 00:13:21.779
Even though we wanted to make ourselves available to do more by means of Bethel service, there was a lot of lessons that we still needed to learn.

00:13:21.779 --> 00:13:33.779
We needed to learn to focus, love and appreciate the privileges we already had up to that point in order to be able to fully appreciate our future Bethel assignment.

00:13:33.779 --> 00:13:40.779
And what a blessing it was, being with those brothers and sisters for those years and being able to witness that growth.

00:13:40.779 --> 00:13:47.779
It was amazing and we finally looked back at it and certainly are memories that we truly treasure.

00:13:47.779 --> 00:13:50.779
Well, those are some valuable lessons that you learned.

00:13:50.779 --> 00:13:54.779
We're glad that Jehovah gave you that training. We're sure it has served you well.

00:13:54.779 --> 00:13:57.779
Let's shift over to you now, Marco.

00:13:57.779 --> 00:14:02.779
Would you mind telling us a little bit about your family background?

00:14:02.779 --> 00:14:12.779
Sure. So growing up I was raised as a Catholic and I used to go every Sunday to the church.

00:14:12.779 --> 00:14:25.779
Yes. But then when I was seventeen years old my uncle began to study the Bible with Jehovah's Witnesses and observing the big changes that it made in his life, in good.

00:14:25.779 --> 00:14:30.779
And how happy he became, maybe really curious about the Bible.

00:14:30.779 --> 00:14:35.779
What's a powerful book? Now it is to change life in such a way.

00:14:35.779 --> 00:14:42.779
And so I accepted to study the Bible as well and when I was nineteen years old I got baptized.

00:14:42.779 --> 00:14:46.779
And later on I started the service as a regular pioneer.

00:14:46.779 --> 00:14:50.779
I attended the ministry at Trinity School or the MTS.

00:14:50.779 --> 00:14:55.779
And yes, as I told you, for the last eighteen years I've been serving a bettered in Rome.

00:14:55.779 --> 00:15:05.779
Okay, excellent. Now during your time here at Gilead it became clear that you have a real love for history, Marco.

00:15:05.779 --> 00:15:18.690
We all thought, was there anything that was part of the Gilead curriculum that particularly caught your attention?

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:23.690
Yes. Here at Gilead we have many artifacts on display.

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:29.690
But there is something in particular that caught my attention and I brought it here to show you.

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:33.690
Really? Does the Gilead office know that you have this?

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:36.690
I will bring it back, sure.

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:38.690
Where do we have?

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:39.690
It's a coin.

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:41.690
Okay, tell us about it.

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:47.690
This coin is authentic coin minted by Emperor Niro in 66th Common Era.

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:51.690
He wanted to celebrate a period of peace.

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:56.690
In fact, if you look carefully on one side you can see one door.

00:15:56.690 --> 00:16:00.690
Okay, I can see that but can you all see this?

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:04.690
Oh, okay. Oh, where is it? There it is.

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:08.690
So this door is the door of ancient temple in Rome.

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:12.690
And this door was kept closed during the period of peace.

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:18.690
And if a Niro wanted to boast that it was capable to bring peace into the empire.

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:26.690
But there was 66th Common Era and the prophecy of Jesus about the destruction of Jerusalem had to be fulfilled.

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:27.690
There it is.

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:40.690
But few months after minting this coin, Niro was forced to send the military army down to Judea to settle the Jewish revolt.

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:46.690
And this fact we know that led to the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple in 70th Common Era.

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:54.690
So you see, a coin like this can remind us a precious lesson that Bible prophecies always fulfill.

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:59.690
Even though propaganda of this war can say differently.

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:00.690
Nice lesson.

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:05.690
I see that you like this story. Would you like to know more about Bible history and Rome?

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:07.690
Of course.

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:16.799
I have a short video to watch together.

00:17:16.799 --> 00:17:17.799
Let's see it.

00:17:17.799 --> 00:17:27.690
Visiting some of the archaeological sites of Italy can help us to imagine what life was like for the early Christians.

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:30.690
Would you like to come with me for a quick tour?

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:32.690
Let's begin here.

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:40.690
Located about 10 kilometers or 6 miles west of Naples, was the ancient poor city of Puthulai.

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:43.690
Today it is known as Potswali.

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:49.690
In about 59 C.E., the Apostle Paul arrived here by boat as a prisoner.

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:57.690
From here, Paul will now begin the long journey to Rome, where he would eventually stand before Caesar himself.

00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:02.690
One of the most famous Roman highways is called the Appian Way.

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:07.690
It averages 6 meters or 20 feet in width.

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:10.690
And was paved with large lava blocks.

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:16.690
It was on this very road that pulled travel to the city of Rome.

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:23.690
Along the way, Paul eventually came to a busy 3D center known as the Marketplace of Apius.

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:30.690
And a leader for the north was a rest area, like an inn, known as the Three Taverns.

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:38.690
Having heard about Paul coming, Christians from Rome organized a group of brothers to meet the Apostle aboard of these stops.

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:46.690
Acts 28-15 tells us that, upon seeing them, Paul thanked God and took courage.

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:50.690
Next, we come to the impressive ruins of Boston, Tika.

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:58.690
This was Rome's most important port. It is about 25 kilometers or 16 miles southwest of Rome.

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:05.690
We get a glimpse of Roman life back then, with this multi-story apartment buildings known as Insule,

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:10.690
along with temples, theatres, thermal baths, and shops.

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:15.690
Walking through the old streets, it's easy to imagine our brothers witnessing to the people.

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:30.690
Perhaps they stopped to eat at a food shop similar to this one, called Thermopolyur, where you could buy bread, wine, roasted meat, cheese, and have some refreshment.

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:36.690
Next, we arrive in Rome, where perhaps the most well-known monument stands.

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:40.690
Yes, you guessed it, the Colosseum.

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:52.690
The Mamoth structure was built in the first century CE, with a seating capacity estimated to be from 40,000 to 87,000 persons.

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:55.690
This was Rome's entertainment center.

00:19:55.690 --> 00:20:04.690
There were mainly two types of games or exhibitions, combat between two gladiators and the hunting of wild animals.

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:11.690
The criminals were also put to death here. Interestingly, entry to the Colosseum was free.

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:18.690
This was part of the policy of the Amperors, who offered free entertainment in order to keep the people under control.

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:24.690
In reality, these pedacles were like a drug that corrupted people's consciences.

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:30.690
Through Christians back then, courageously refused to take any part as spectators.

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:36.690
By the way, do you know where the Romans got the funds to build this huge stadium?

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:40.690
It came from the conquest of Jerusalem in 70 CE.

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:45.690
In fact, there is even an inscription at the Colosseum that reads,

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:56.690
The Amperors tied to Caesar, Vespasian Augustus, ordered the new amphitheater to be made from the proceeds from the sale of the booty.

00:20:56.690 --> 00:21:06.690
To remember this important event, Emperor Domitian had a Trojan full arch built in honor of his brother Titus, who conquered Jerusalem and later became Emperor.

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:18.690
If you look carefully, you can see a bus relift with a scene of Roman soldiers carrying the spoils from Jerusalem, with a lampstand taken from Jehovah's Temple.

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:26.690
The arch stands today as a clear fulfillment of Jesus' words about the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple.

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:39.690
So you see, if we use the Bible as a map, even the stones can be silent witnesses that the Bible is a book of true history, true life and true prophecies.

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:41.690
I hope you enjoyed the tour.

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:52.220
Thank you for taking us on that wonderful tour, Marco.

00:21:52.220 --> 00:22:02.220
After seeing that video, we all want to go to Italy ourselves. Don't we see those sites in person? Be prepared.

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:09.220
So, Maddie, let's come back to you now. What has been the highlight of your Gilea training?

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:21.220
You know, I wasn't raised in the truth. So as a teenager, I was interested in making sure I improved my situation by means of secular education.

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:28.220
I thought education was the answer. I thought it was my ticket out. And boy, did Jehovah fool me?

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:29.220
How so?

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:39.220
Well, secular education wasn't the answer, but education was. Jehovah knew I needed the very best education, the vine education.

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:50.220
And the truth is that what I've learned from our grand instructor, Jehovah, surpasses by far anything that the secular education could have provided me.

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:58.220
It's truly helped me see that, in fact, the education that Jehovah provides us makes us better people.

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:08.220
So in Gilea's school, I have been able to appreciate how Jehovah has continued to train us and provide us with something that's helpful not only to myself but to others.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:15.220
And honestly, I'm really grateful that I've had this opportunity to get better acquainted with my Heavenly Father.

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:25.220
Oh, well stated. Now tell us the final question to you. How do you plan on using in your assignment, which you've learned at Gilea?

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:36.220
I would tend to steer or guide myself toward guidelines, but Gilea has taught me that while guidelines are important,

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:41.220
I can't lose sight of what's more important to Jehovah, and that's people.

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:42.220
Yes.

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:48.220
And Jesus knew that, and he saw that. Therefore, I want to imitate Jesus in my dealings with people.

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:53.220
When he was on earth, who knew the rules better than Jesus?

00:23:53.220 --> 00:24:01.220
Yet, what was his focus? People. He put people first. He loved them. He didn't hold that against them.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:14.220
In my assignment, I hope to imitate Jesus fully in that I can balance guidelines with principles, but never losing sight of loving Jehovah's people.

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:19.220
Oh, that's beautiful. Nice lesson learned. Thank you for sharing that.

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:30.220
In fact, why don't we get an expression from the rest of you on those very same questions? How about you, Adalia? What has been the highlight of your Gilea training?

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:38.220
To be honest with you, Brother Chilson, I came to Gilea very scared and apprehensive of the unknown.

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:49.220
Not knowing what our future assignment might be was very unsettling to me, but after several lessons, I feel positive and better equipped for what the future holds for us.

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:55.220
We did a deep dive into the sermon on the Mount, and one particular illustration touched me.

00:24:55.220 --> 00:25:03.220
Matthew 7, verse 9 and 10, Jesus asks which father, when his son asks for a fish, would hand him a serpent.

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:11.220
Now, his listeners understood that a fish could resemble a serpent, so that illustration took on a little bit more meaning.

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:19.220
Even though a son could have been initially deceived if he received a serpent, a loving father would never do such a thing.

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:27.220
So I realize that my Heavenly Father Jehovah would never give me something bad and make it appear as something good.

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:38.220
So after meditating on this, I realize that Jehovah will only give me something that will be beneficial for us, and whatever he asks, it will only be for my eternal happiness.

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:51.220
Ah, that's beautiful. Yeah, we pray that you have success in that. In the final question for you, Adalia, how do you hope to use in your assignment what you've learned at Gilea?

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:57.220
I know our brothers and sisters are going through a lot. I want to be able to help strengthen their faith.

00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:04.220
The way mine has been built, by sharing with them things that I've learned in school, and also just by living examples,

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:13.220
being a living example for them, and also making sure that they understand whatever challenge or trial that they face, Jehovah will sustain them.

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:19.220
There's no doubt about it. So with all that being said, I know that we're ready for whatever the future holds for us.

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:25.220
And the way my faith has been strengthened, it's my treasure, my possession that I'm never going to let go of.

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:29.220
Ah, that's beautiful. Thank you for sharing with us.

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:36.220
Hanta, let's ask you that question. What has been the highlight of Gilea training for you?

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:49.220
I've learned many times, I've read in our publications, many times, that Jehovah never fails to reward his faithful ones.

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:54.220
But Gilea helped me to understand that more fully.

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:55.220
What do you mean?

00:26:55.220 --> 00:27:12.220
For example, Jehovah used Nebuchadnezzar to conquer Tyre, but Nebuchadnezzar and his men did not get many things, many riches from Tyre.

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:21.220
So it was as if Jehovah told him Nebuchadnezzar, thank you very much for your labor for me.

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:35.220
Here I give you treasures from Egypt. Nebuchadnezzar was not his servant, but he rewarded him for the labor he did for him.

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:48.220
So if Jehovah can't do that to someone who is not worshiping him, how much more so will he reward those who are loyal to him?

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:50.220
So that really is trying for me.

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:55.220
Oh, what a beautiful lesson you learned. Thank you. Thank you for sharing that.

00:27:55.220 --> 00:28:04.220
And final question to you, Hanta, how do you plan on using what you've learned in your assignment from what you've gathered here at Gilea?

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:15.220
Yes, when a sister comes to me with her problem, I quickly think of a solution even when the sister is still speaking.

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:22.220
But Gilea told me to listen, to show empathy.

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:28.220
The person may not need a solution at all. Maybe what she needs is a listening ear.

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:39.220
But when help is needed, I'm determined to use Bible principle, to reason with the person and allow the person to draw the conclusion.

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:43.220
So I allow the person to draw conclusion as well.

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:48.220
We wish you success in that, Hanta. Thank you so much for sharing that with us.

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:54.220
Simon, let's go over to you. What has been the highlight of your Gilea training?

00:28:54.220 --> 00:29:01.220
For me, the growing spiritual course lessons have a huge impact.

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:05.220
I even changed my prayer a little bit.

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:17.220
For example, I used to pray to Jehovah, please help me to show love to my wife and friends and brothers and sisters.

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:20.220
Good prayer, great prayer.

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:28.220
But it's a little bit vague. But now I understand what love is specifically.

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:44.220
Love is unselfish cruelty, focusing on doing good to others, regardless of the merit of the recipient or any benefit I could get back.

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:58.220
So now I know that when I pray to Jehovah to show love, I am asking for help to be more unselfish person.

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:02.220
That's beautiful. That's a good lesson you've learned.

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:11.220
Now tell us how do you plan on using in your assignment what you've gathered here at Gilea?

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:20.220
You know, the Gilea training made me understand that why I loved computers so much.

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:24.220
We have to know more about that. What do you mean?

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:32.220
Because I can program the computers how they work and they will just work.

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:39.220
But people are not like that. They are unpredictable.

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:44.220
And they don't always do what I want them to do.

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:54.500
So because of this, when I am focusing on something technical, it is not always easy for me to switch my mind to love people.

00:30:54.500 --> 00:31:04.500
So my goal is to love people that way Jehovah loves them. Remembering they are doing their best as I am.

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:11.500
Good lesson learned. Thank you for sharing that with us. Let's talk to your wife now, Eoshi.

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:14.500
What has been the highlight of your Gilea training?

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:21.500
Yeah. Well, I'm seeing the footage of the spirit in a way that I never thought of before.

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:22.500
Can I give you an example?

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:23.500
Please.

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:30.500
So our culture is generally viewed as being humble and polite.

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:40.500
Gilea has taught me that that kind of humility, though, is not a result of the Holy Spirit or a footage of the Holy Spirit.

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:47.500
Gilea has taught me that humility, love, kindness, all those good qualities.

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:55.500
They have to come from much, much deeper down, not culture or your natural tendency or personality.

00:31:55.500 --> 00:32:03.500
It has to be driven by Jehovah, by his Holy Spirit, for it to be a footage of the Holy Spirit.

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:10.500
In that understanding of Jehovah helping us in our good points, that just really blew my mind.

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:13.500
Okay. Nice.

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:18.500
So how do you plan on using in your assignment what you've learned at Gilea at Eoshi?

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:22.500
Yes. So the Holy Spirit power is very strong.

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:33.500
So my goal is when I get to my new assignment, is to be able to expand my comfort zone by denouncing what Jehovah's help,

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:42.500
so that I can be more people oriented, and I can be comfortable with people, and I hope they'll be comfortable with me, too.

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:48.500
We have every confidence that they will be. Well done, Yoshi. Thank you.

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:57.500
Now finally, Marco, you're our last one here. So what has been the highlight of your Gilea training?

00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:02.500
I think that Gilea helped me to love the Bible even more.

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:10.500
I realized that digging into it, the more I studied the Bible, the more I found new things to learn that I didn't imagine.

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:20.500
And I could compare the Bible now to a suitcase with a double or triple bottom layer, and full of things.

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:28.500
And because the more I look into it, the more I can take out more things that maybe I didn't see at the beginning.

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:39.500
So the lesson for me is that when I study the Bible, I should slow down, take my time to meditate, find the different angles, study all the aspects.

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:45.500
Because nothing in the Bible is random or written by chance.

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:51.500
Nice, nice lesson, you've learned there. And how do you plan on using in your assignment what you've learned?

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:56.500
Yes, I think to be aware of how rich is the Bible will help me in any assignment.

00:33:56.500 --> 00:34:06.500
I'm more convinced that in any circumstances, I will face in the future new circumstances, could be challenging or unexpected.

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:17.500
I think that the only thing I have to do is to go back to the Bible and look for a similar situation or a lesson or a Bible principle that can apply.

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:24.500
Because I'm sure that Jehovah has a loving father, has already written in the Bible everything that I need.

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:28.500
Excellent, well done, and we'll pray for your success in that too, Marco.

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:37.500
Well, we have thoroughly enjoyed getting to know the six of you better and we appreciate so much you sharing with us your personal expressions.

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:45.500
We echo the words of the Apostle Paul written at 2 Timothy, chapter 4, verse 22, when he said,

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:52.500
The Lord be with the Spirit you show. His undeserved kindness be with you.

00:34:52.500 --> 00:35:01.500
It is our prayer that Jehovah's rich blessing continue upon you six and the rest of your Gilead Class 156.

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:07.500
And to all of you in our viewing audience, thank you for joining us.

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:13.500
We look forward to being with you again on the next edition of the Inside Story.
