00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:15.539
If I had known what was going to happen that day,

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:17.539
I probably would have stayed in bed.

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:22.989
My name is Ethan.

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:29.980
I'm 14 years old.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.479
And like any teenager, the first day of school

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:46.390
can be a little scary.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.890
In junior high,

00:00:47.890 --> 00:01:01.280
there's always someone who wants to cause trouble.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.280
So, there I was.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.219
The first day in my new class,

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:12.349
all I wanted to do was make a good first impression

00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:17.840
and stay out of trouble.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.340
But it came looking for me.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:02:29.710
My life in junior high was now over.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.210
I started to imagine what the rest of the year might be like.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:51.240
It wasn't a pretty picture.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:58.030
Things got better when I talked to dad.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.030
I told him everything that happened that day.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.030
He listened to me,

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.030
told me we would face it together

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.030
to make it the subject of our next family worship.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.530
Dad said,

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.530
we're going to talk about a real challenge David faced

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:24.229
and what helped him.

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:27.229
David had enemies that were determined to hurt him.

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:30.229
Instead of taking matters into his own hands,

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:33.229
he trusted in Jehovah.

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:35.229
He wasn't weak.

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:39.229
In fact, many celebrated his victories.

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:53.590
And this made King Saul very jealous.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.590
His friends wanted him to fight Saul.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:03.939
But instead, he relied on Jehovah.

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:06.939
Saul's son Jonathan was a true friend.

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:09.939
He warned David when he was in danger.

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:20.480
I learned a lot from that Bible account.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.959
Don't take matters in my own hands.

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:26.959
Avoid the bully when possible.

00:04:26.959 --> 00:04:32.360
Be a real friend to those in trouble.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.600
Talk to someone that can help.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:42.160
Like parents, a teacher, or a responsible adult.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.160
And most importantly, pray to Jehovah and rely on him.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.279
That weekend, we went out in service as a family.

00:04:52.279 --> 00:05:05.079
I wouldn't believe who came to the door.

00:05:05.079 --> 00:05:07.079
It was the bully.

00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:09.079
I quickly said a prayer.

00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:13.089
I started with my presentation.

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:18.449
I even showed him a video.

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:22.449
You know, my parents used the Bible to give me the confidence

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:25.449
I needed to deal with a bully.
