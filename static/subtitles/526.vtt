00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:10.380
The text for today, here in Colossians 4, verse 6, sets a standard for us in our speech.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:18.019
It says, let your words always be gracious, seasoned, with salt.

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:19.940
So we will consider three questions.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.260
The first one, what is gracious speech?

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.539
Secondly, why are gracious words so important?

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:38.420
And third, how can we learn to speak graciously?

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.420
So that first one, what is gracious speech?

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.619
The word gracious has a special meaning.

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:54.740
The Apostle Paul used his Greek word more than 100 times in his writings.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.619
So what is so special about this word?

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:05.140
This word is translated also as undeserved kindness.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.700
And in some cases, it is translated as a kind gift.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:17.739
So apply it to the words in the text, let your words always be a kind gift.

00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:24.659
We can compare this concept with the words of Paul in Ephesians chapter 4.

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:35.420
It says in Ephesians 4, verse 29, the second part of the verse, only what is good for building

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:42.299
up as the need may be to impart what is beneficial to the hearers.

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:50.980
But now note what he says in the first part of this verse, let a rotten word not come out

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.180
of your mouth.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.459
That's a strong concept.

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:04.459
Maybe you have had in your refrigerator some food that went off on the outside, it looks fine.

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:11.460
But when you open that lid and that putrid smell comes out, you turn your head away, you close

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.509
the lid and you get relevant as fast as you can.

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:21.710
Now think of a conversation you have with your close friend.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.750
You're expecting to hear something really good and upbuilding from him.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:35.669
But out comes these critical, nasty and negative comments about somebody else or about

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:37.509
some arrangement.

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:40.030
How disappointing.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.629
The smell is just overwhelming, but you cannot react as you would with that container

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:50.710
of food in case you become the next target.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:51.710
So what do you do?

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:57.430
Just quietly put a lid on that conversation and throw it away.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:06.250
Now I'm sure all of us have been there at some time, on either side of the conversation,

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.889
but now we come to the second part.

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:14.050
Why is it so important to have gracious speech?

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.569
Consider the words here in James, James chapter 3.

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:26.569
Now here it says in verse 6, James 3 verse 6, the tongue is also a fire.

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:34.330
The tongue represents a world of unrighteousness among our body members, for it defiles all

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:44.810
the body and sets the whole course of life on fire and it is set on fire by Gehenna.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.610
So who is liable to Gehenna?

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.090
It's the one misusing their tongue.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.289
Jesus said the same thing.

00:03:53.289 --> 00:04:05.289
Consider his words here in Matthew, Matthew chapter 12, and here Jesus says in verse 36,

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:16.050
he says, I tell you that men will render an account on judgment day for every unprofitable

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.370
saying that they speak.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:25.410
We may say, but is Gehenna judging us on the person we are on the inside?

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.410
Exactly.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:32.970
Look what it says in verse 34, the second part of verse 34, for out of the abundance

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.529
of the heart, the mouth speaks.

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:46.410
The words seem to appear from the top of the head, but they really come from the heart.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:54.490
And Jehovah judges a person on the inside and on the impact day words might have on other

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:55.490
people.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:02.810
Of course, Jehovah says the most beautiful example for us of kind and gracious speech.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:09.769
Look at this example in Zechariah, Zechariah chapter 1.

00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:18.689
And here in Zechariah chapter 1, an angel of Jehovah is speaking to Jehovah in verse 12.

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:24.730
Now this angel is very distressed because it seems that false worship is gaining the upper

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:32.769
hand and true worship is being pushed aside and he says here in verse 12, oh Jehovah

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:40.370
of armies, how long will you withhold your mercy from Jerusalem and the cities of Judah,

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:45.050
with whom you have been indignant these 70 years?

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:53.290
Now look at verse 13, Jehovah answered the angel who was speaking with me with kind and

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.089
comforting words.

00:05:55.089 --> 00:06:02.569
Now the account does not say what Jehovah said, but we know Jehovah is gracious and

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:04.769
kind.

00:06:04.769 --> 00:06:14.769
So now we come to our third question, how can we learn to be gracious or to have gracious

00:06:14.769 --> 00:06:15.769
speech?

00:06:15.769 --> 00:06:21.689
Well, there are two principles we would highlight because this is a very complicated subject.

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:27.529
And the first one we would like to highlight is in Ephesians chapter 5, verse 1, Ephesians

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:30.329
chapter 5 is 1.

00:06:30.329 --> 00:06:39.730
And there it says, therefore, become imitators of God as beloved children.

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:47.529
Now we know children imitate their parents, they just find it so enjoyable to do something

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:50.529
for their parents, they imitate them.

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:55.689
You see this little girl, she gives a gift to her mother.

00:06:55.689 --> 00:07:03.569
Now it is not the best gift to the greatest gift ever, but to the mother it is wonderful.

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:05.569
Why?

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:06.810
Because she is imitating her.

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:12.449
She probably saw her being generous to other people and she imitates that.

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:15.569
And that makes her feel very, very good.

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:17.970
The same with Jehovah.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:23.689
When we imitate him, we bring joy to his heart.

00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:29.889
It is all a matter of appreciation, isn't it?

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:38.610
Nothing builds appreciation more than being grateful to say, thank you.

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:44.370
So thank Jehovah for everything it does for us, every day.

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:50.050
No, we probably don't need to know the half of what he really is doing for us.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:53.529
But if we thank him all the time.

00:07:53.529 --> 00:07:58.569
Every day, make it a point to thank him for the things we see he does for us.

00:07:58.569 --> 00:08:04.769
It will engender in our hearts an appreciation for Jehovah.

00:08:04.769 --> 00:08:06.569
And we will admire him.

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:15.490
And the more we admire Jehovah, the more we will be inclined to imitate him.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:21.689
And there is no need to feel unworthy saying, oh wow, I cannot imitate Jehovah.

00:08:21.689 --> 00:08:31.610
Now the only qualification needed is to have an appreciative heart.

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:37.169
The second principle we would like to highlight is contained in our text for today, which

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:41.970
says, our words should be seasoned with salt.

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:47.049
Now in Bible times, they didn't have refrigeration.

00:08:47.049 --> 00:08:51.250
So in order to preserve food, they would salt them.

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:59.409
They would season them with salt to make sure that the food is not spoiled.

00:08:59.409 --> 00:09:09.129
Our words, our gracious words, should preserve the dignity of other people.

00:09:09.129 --> 00:09:18.769
It should preserve love and friendships that will last forever.

00:09:18.769 --> 00:09:24.490
These words that we speak will come from an appreciative heart.

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:29.250
So look for the good in other people.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:34.970
And say the right thing to strengthen the good in them.

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:40.009
And we do say the nicest things to those we love, don't we?

00:09:40.009 --> 00:09:48.210
So in conclusion, regardless of what we go through or how we feel, always be gracious.

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:53.009
It is never wrong to do good and be kind.

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:59.570
Don't give up and make this the standard of the Sais and Sam 1914.

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:08.769
Let the sayings of my mouth and the meditation of my heart become pleasurable before you,

00:10:08.769 --> 00:10:11.690
Jehovah, my rock and my redeemer.
