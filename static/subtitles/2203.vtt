00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:20.070
No one can slay for two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or he will stick to the one and despise the other

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.589
You cannot slay for God and for riches

00:00:24.629 --> 00:00:28.670
Excuse me. I have to talk to other clients as well. I thought I could do both

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.270
But tonight I had to make a choice. How's it going everyone? I guess doing okay. Oh, yes good

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:42.950
When is Marty going to be here? He was supposed to show me some other offerings in this building

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.509
Yes, Marty will be here very soon sir

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:52.990
Would you care for another glass of wine? No, I don't have much time. I can't stay long. I have another important meeting tonight

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:58.859
Everyone had tried to warn me

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.420
They told me to remember to remember the wife of lot

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:41.780
You can do it. Okay, keep practicing. Okay. I'm almost done good good

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.500
We are going to make a grandma special best told daddy today. I'm gonna help me sure

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.659
Hey girls from home. Hey

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.700
Wow, you guys are busy

00:01:54.819 --> 00:02:00.140
Hey, Gloria, you went on Thursday. How did it go? Yes? We had really nice time

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.620
I had some nice calls over an east side of town. Oh really? Yeah, hey, you know

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.419
Joe the contractor. I've been doing accounts for all these years. Uh-huh

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.819
Well, I got a chance to witness to him today and he agreed to start a study

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.539
Wow, dad. That's awesome. Oh, that's great. I hope he works out. Yeah, I do too. Oh, what's that?

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:22.419
Hey, you can't wait a little bit

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.020
I don't know what you're making, but I'm sure it's really good. Well if you let us finish making it

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.979
Okay, all right, all right. I give up. I give up. I'm gonna work on the budget. Okay, so just call me when it's ready

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:35.979
All right, okay, sure

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.900
Oh, Tina, by the way, is your talk ready?

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.180
Circuit will still be there so you want it to be perfect. It will be, but that's not till next week anyway

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.139
How about your score?

00:02:48.139 --> 00:03:12.080
Already dead. Hmm. Hey dad

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.120
There's some strange man walking into our building strange man

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:33.849
Let me check. It's okay. It's Joe. Joe

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.370
Why is he coming here? I didn't tell you. Yeah, he's gonna pick up his books for the study, okay?

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:50.129
Joe, thanks for coming over man. Yeah, come on in. Oh, if you don't mind. Can you take off your shoes? You can just put it on the rack over here

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.469
Serious. Yeah, this is where we put all our shoes

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.259
Okay, those are nice boots. Yeah, thanks. I want you to meet my family. This is a

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:09.620
This is my wife, Gloria. What's up? And our daughters Tina and Anna. Hi. Yeah, hello

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:18.040
Okay, why don't we come into my office? Mm-hmm. All right, come on over. Okay. All right, here's a chair

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:33.740
Get that for you and you can take a seat and oh before you do so can you grab the door cozy, isn't it?

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:40.019
How do you get anything done in here, man? I mean, it's really convenient. I mean everything said arms reach

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:42.339
It works. It's good

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.860
Okay, so what we're gonna study or what um we can if you like

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:55.540
But today I was just planning on giving you the book I was talking to you about and also I want to give you your own copy of the bible

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.540
So you could look up the scriptures. So this is for you

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.240
Coming from my background as an accountant. It's organized so nicely

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:14.000
It explains everything in such logical order and it also helps us to see how the bible applies to every day topics

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:18.399
Like what being a diligent worker you're gonna see the bible

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:25.120
It says that working with your hands. That's good work, too. Just as long as you're honest. I'm telling you, man

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:32.399
Nobody's honest today, man. Not even my suppliers. If I had it my way, I take those guys and I give them what they deserve. Okay

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.079
Joe

00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:43.120
Look, I understand it's not easy making a living. No, it's not but you know many people deal with upsetting situations by applying

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.360
Scriptural principles the bible shows us how we could find true peace and

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.959
And also to get our emotions under control. I can't help it man. I was born angry

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:56.800
Joe

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.660
You're gonna learn that the bible tells us that we have to make our minds over

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:07.160
We had to put on the new personality and personality. I can't be somebody. I'm not man. I

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.560
Understand I tell you what why don't we talk about this some more?

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.839
You know when I come over to your place for the study, okay? Yeah, all right. Whatever

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:25.019
So we'll see that your place Joe. Okay. All right. Do you want to have something to eat before you go?

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:33.040
I'm good. Thanks

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:38.920
Again for coming by and picking up the books. Okay. Okay, Joe. All right, be safe man. Bye soon. Bye

00:06:52.870 --> 00:07:04.439
Boys your dad's home start getting ready for dinner, okay? Hey boys. Hey, yeah, all right

00:07:05.439 --> 00:07:07.439
Hey, how's it going?

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.040
Good good. How was your day? All right?

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.560
Hey, so what are those books? Oh these

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:20.720
Those are just some books from my accountant Brian. Are they financial books because that looks like a bible. Yeah

00:07:21.519 --> 00:07:23.839
Yeah, Brian's a pretty religious guy

00:07:25.399 --> 00:07:29.360
Yeah, it's got nice family too. Anyway, so what we have for dinner?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
What what when did you meet his family? Oh, I just saw him around

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.360
Yeah, he said it might be good to come over

00:07:36.959 --> 00:07:43.120
Bring his wife maybe to meet you and they've got two daughters about Ricky and Arthur's age put the phone away. Come on

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.279
Let's go turn that game off. Let's eat. You made your favorite dinner. Oh

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:48.800
tacos

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:59.759
Okay, let's say a prayer

00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:04.800
Ruby you have to convince Gloria. She's your daughter. She is making me look bad

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.680
She is my niece. So the way she lives reflects on me, too

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.279
She just needs to come work for my company. Then she'll be successful

00:08:12.959 --> 00:08:31.860
You should talk to her about that. All right? Okay. Bye. Would you like the crystal gel today? Oh, it's okay

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:35.059
It's too expensive. You need more money

00:08:36.019 --> 00:08:40.740
Not super rich, but just enough to have what our relatives have

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:46.259
Oh, they look down on you mom. We have enough money. Maybe enough for today

00:08:47.139 --> 00:08:53.620
But what if you get sick mom, please listen to me. Okay, you're done. I can try. Okay

00:08:54.899 --> 00:09:00.019
Hasn't Brian lost some of his clients lately. Now you have to take care of yourself

00:09:00.659 --> 00:09:06.100
You know your uncle can help you find a good job in his real estate company mom

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:11.779
Jehovah will take care of us as long as we trust in him you waste time on God

00:09:13.059 --> 00:09:15.059
Doing that pioneering thing

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.019
The time that you could use to make money

00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:23.860
How would you have enough when you're old mom? Please listen to me

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:31.779
What an old lady can't give you some advice no, but we already talked about you never listen. I listen

00:09:34.059 --> 00:09:37.820
Mom, I listen, but would you please listen to me once

00:09:44.639 --> 00:09:51.120
Your girls have to help you have no sons. So they are your most important investment

00:09:51.679 --> 00:09:55.519
You have to get them into good jobs like your brothers kids

00:09:55.759 --> 00:10:01.039
We don't expect our girls to provide us with money or support or anything. No, you just don't know

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.120
What it's like to be poor. I

00:10:03.759 --> 00:10:11.840
Know I remember when I was young all I had to eat was turn off that I dug out of the cold ground

00:10:12.559 --> 00:10:16.080
And I had to wear my sister shoes with holes in them

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.200
Look at my shoes

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:26.029
Do you see holes in them? How do you think I got shoes with no holes, huh?

00:10:26.509 --> 00:10:47.340
I can help us to cope with any stress or

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:49.740
Endary when they face in the future

00:10:50.379 --> 00:10:55.820
My husband just lost his job. So this might help. Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that

00:10:56.059 --> 00:11:00.620
Oh, please be sure to read it and also check out our website. Okay. Thank you. Have a good day

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:11.009
Hey, that was good. Yeah, it's okay. Are you okay?

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:17.250
Well, Brian, I'm worried what happened to her can happen to us too

00:11:18.049 --> 00:11:22.529
I mean we need a stable income and I can get a job in my uncle's real estate firm

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:25.330
Maybe this is an answer to our prayers

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:29.090
I might have to quit pioneering until I settle into work and stuff

00:11:29.169 --> 00:11:34.610
But just for a while until we're financially more stable. Oh, yeah, we have enough

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:38.610
Besides you hope it will take care of us. He always has

00:11:39.409 --> 00:11:45.330
We just have to trust in him. What about our girls? They need a stable income to be pioneers. They have

00:11:49.759 --> 00:11:54.799
They need a stable income to be pioneers and they need to know where their next meal is going from and that they have

00:11:54.799 --> 00:11:59.039
You know, close to keep them more. I mean don't you believe that you hope we'll keep this promise to help us?

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.000
Of course, but you never know what could have happened tomorrow

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.759
We don't expect to do it just to drop everything we did into our last. Do we?

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:11.279
Money is protection, right? We just need to be realistic and balanced

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:15.440
Gloria Jesus said never be anxious about the next day

00:12:17.759 --> 00:12:19.759
Hello

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.960
Can I just take one of these? Yes, please do. Please be sure to visit our website for more information

00:12:28.659 --> 00:12:31.700
Oh, anyways, my Bible study Joe texted me earlier today

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:35.779
So he's looking forward to seeing us later at their place. I almost forgot

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.340
What time I was supposed to be there?

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.980
Right after we're done here and we take the cart back to the kingdom home

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:43.700
Okay, I want us to buy home in fresh enough to

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:51.470
So you guys meet a lot of different people when you do this work

00:12:52.269 --> 00:12:56.990
Yes, as Jova's witnesses, we like to meet people from different backgrounds and cultures

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:01.470
Yeah, we like to meet people from other countries. Don't we marry?

00:13:02.429 --> 00:13:04.429
Yeah, we do

00:13:04.429 --> 00:13:06.990
But we already have our own religion and traditions

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:09.870
They're part of who we are

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:13.230
Didn't become a witness mean you had to give that all up not at all

00:13:13.629 --> 00:13:15.950
We'll still enjoy our traditional food

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:18.350
Music and clothes. There's so many other things

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:21.789
Yes, so we enjoy the best parts of all cultures

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:24.909
We just avoid the parts that God disapproves of like what

00:13:25.549 --> 00:13:31.710
Well, for example, my mother still prepares food to offer to our dead ancestors and special days. Oh wow

00:13:32.429 --> 00:13:34.429
Yeah, I don't think I would ever do that

00:13:35.149 --> 00:13:41.710
Well, it's like with the first century Christians. There were certain common attitudes and Jewish customs that they had to leave behind

00:13:42.269 --> 00:13:47.950
So what did your family say when you changed your religion? My mother was very upset

00:13:48.509 --> 00:13:52.190
She's not so angry anymore, although she doesn't understand. Oh

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:55.789
Gloria Brian. These are our boys Arthur and Ricky. Oh, hi

00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:06.830
And Ricky. They're amazing boys. Yeah, my boys. How y'all doing good? Yeah good to meet you both. So how old are you? I'm 16

00:14:07.149 --> 00:14:09.149
You're not almost

00:14:09.149 --> 00:14:15.070
16. I'm 18. Oh, which high school do you attend the one right down the street? Oh, that's our girl school, too

00:14:15.549 --> 00:14:17.870
Um, do you know Anna and Tina?

00:14:18.509 --> 00:14:22.669
Oh, yeah, I've I've definitely seen them around. They're both so

00:14:23.549 --> 00:14:25.549
Uh, really brainy

00:14:26.669 --> 00:14:31.730
Okay

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:33.730
Your girls are very lovely

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:41.009
I'm sure they're very good girls. Oh, thank you. You know, actually they both want to be full-time Bible teachers. Oh

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:45.730
Oh, uh, by the way, you know, we wanted to invite you all of you

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:51.250
To the hall of the Sunday. We have a special speaker. He's very special. Yes, he's dear to us

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:53.490
And we've known him for years

00:14:56.529 --> 00:14:58.529
I don't know

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:03.730
Well seen maybe just to check it out, but we'll have to talk about that

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:18.909
Gloria, why did you give me that look when I said that girls wanted to be in full-time service? Well

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:24.830
I was reminded recently that the safest road is to get a good job with a good company

00:15:27.889 --> 00:15:29.649
Has your mom been talking to you about this again?

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:33.169
She's my mom. I have to listen to her. I owe it to her

00:15:34.049 --> 00:15:37.649
You know, my father died when my brother and I were young and then after that

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:41.409
My mom had to raise her son. They are doing nothing. You know, if they were

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:44.210
Yes, I know she was very brave

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:46.610
Okay, but she didn't know Jehovah

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:47.809
We do

00:15:47.809 --> 00:15:51.809
Shouldn't we be encouraging our girls to serve him full-time? Why can't they do both?

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:54.450
Everyone has to work, right?

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:56.690
Okay, but what comes first work or Jehovah

00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:01.809
But you see there are so many witnesses that have prestigious high-paying jobs

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:06.450
Yeah, but should we be pushing Anna and Tina to succeed in this system?

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:09.090
No, I'm not. I just want them to have normal life

00:16:09.649 --> 00:16:12.289
And who knows how long this system will last

00:16:12.529 --> 00:16:15.009
And what is wrong with living comfortably in the meantime

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:20.529
Okay, this is not a last day's question. Okay, it's always been wrong to strive to be rich

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:23.090
No, not rich just plenty

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:26.370
Just enough to give them peace of mind so that they can sleep soundly

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:29.730
That's exactly the opposite of what the Bible says

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:32.370
Sweet is the sleep of the one serving

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:36.129
But the plenty belonging to the rich does not permit him to sleep

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:41.090
But don't you think they need a fallback career just in case

00:16:42.929 --> 00:16:45.409
Just in case what in case Jesus was wrong

00:16:58.110 --> 00:16:59.389
So

00:16:59.389 --> 00:17:03.230
Guess what what mom's not freaked out because we recognize my picture

00:17:04.509 --> 00:17:08.269
Yeah, that figures he's cute, but mom would never approve anyway

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:12.829
Of course not she'd say you're too young and he's not in the truth

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:17.630
Yeah, not just that their family isn't as well off as we are

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:20.430
I don't forget the oh

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:22.990
Factor right if gamma heard of it should go

00:17:23.789 --> 00:17:25.789
Oh

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:28.589
Hey girls

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:34.190
You know what I always told you you need to marry someone with the same standard as ours

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:38.269
You have to consider their family background and parents career

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:44.670
Mom doesn't the Bible say marry only in the Lord not only in your social class. Yeah, never mind

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:48.269
Have you guys finished your homework yet and your finals coming up?

00:17:48.509 --> 00:17:51.390
I don't want you missing anymore meetings than necessary. Okay

00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:00.019
Why should they miss any meetings you know putting school before Jehovah?

00:18:00.019 --> 00:18:03.779
That's just practice for putting work before Jehovah sometimes they have to

00:18:08.019 --> 00:18:10.579
What are those you're not going out in your sister shoes

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:17.700
Why not because I said so but these are perfect. She doesn't worry them anymore never never your grandma had to wear her sister shoes

00:18:17.779 --> 00:18:23.220
And they had holes in them mom calm down. I don't wear them anymore. She was so ashamed

00:18:23.539 --> 00:18:28.900
I made up my mind to make a lot of money so no one would ever send me bottle clothes and you are not going to borrow it either

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.740
Hey, so you're gonna go or what all right? I'll go now really me alone

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:47.099
Well, you don't have to go if you don't want to well if you don't want me to go then I won't

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:54.619
I do okay. I said I do I want you to go so I said I'd go I'd go just to see

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.980
Okay, okay, good

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:08.240
Good, thank you, but this may be the only time

00:19:09.279 --> 00:19:12.400
Maybe yeah, I'm gonna tell you exactly what's gonna happen

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:18.160
It's the same thing that happens when I go to church the people don't even know that I'm there. So why go

00:19:19.119 --> 00:19:21.119
What nothing?

00:19:21.839 --> 00:19:44.349
You'll see you'll see

00:19:44.349 --> 00:19:45.869
We'd like to welcome back

00:19:45.869 --> 00:19:49.470
Brother Lee Williams to deliver his final talk entitled

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:54.269
No one can slave for two masters brother Williams, please

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:13.089
There are billions of people who are enslaved without even realizing it

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:19.170
They unintentionally do it to themselves because they feel obligated to follow the

00:20:19.569 --> 00:20:24.769
Traditions of their culture and they put family and money ahead of God

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:28.130
But Jesus made it clear that sooner or later

00:20:28.849 --> 00:20:34.130
Everyone on earth will have to choose who or what they will serve as master

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:36.930
either Jehovah or

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:40.369
Money and the power and prestige that goes with having it

00:20:40.849 --> 00:20:47.250
Notice how Jesus explained this at Matthew chapter 6 and verse 24 I invite you to open your Bibles there

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.849
Matthew chapter 6 and verse 24

00:20:51.809 --> 00:20:56.210
And Jesus said no one can slave for two masters

00:20:57.089 --> 00:21:00.210
For either he will hate the one and love the other

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:03.890
Or he will stick to the one and despise the other

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:09.569
You cannot slave for God and for riches

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:15.009
Now how can someone be divided in loyalty like this

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:18.690
Well, let's think of a Bible example

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:21.490
Lot in his family

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:25.170
Now a lot moved his family near Sodom

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:33.730
And then later into the city although knowing that the men there were wicked gross sinners against Jehovah

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:36.529
Was he seeking material security?

00:21:37.329 --> 00:21:39.569
Did he give into pressure from his wife?

00:21:41.089 --> 00:21:42.769
Did they

00:21:42.769 --> 00:21:44.769
Try to serve two masters

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:53.250
Well, whatever the case we know the results the family suffered spiritually and they put their lives at risk

00:21:55.089 --> 00:22:03.170
Eventually this attitude affected Lot's wife so much that she loved the comforts of Sodom more than Jehovah

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:08.049
Even while Jehovah used the angels to try to get them out of that wicked city

00:22:08.769 --> 00:22:10.769
Lot's wife looked back

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:14.289
Possibly because of her attachment to her things

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:18.769
And she became a pillar of salt

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:23.410
Now could Lot's wife have avoided that tragic outcome?

00:22:24.369 --> 00:22:27.009
Of course it didn't have to end that way

00:22:28.289 --> 00:22:35.650
No wonder Jesus made the very direct comments at Luke chapter 17 verse 32 when he said

00:22:36.609 --> 00:22:39.329
Remember the wife of Lot

00:22:41.089 --> 00:22:43.089
And there was the lesson for us

00:22:43.809 --> 00:22:49.009
We are living at a time when it is vital that we do not look back

00:22:52.690 --> 00:23:02.930
What a sobering reminder that we should put Jehovah God first and seek his approval before family money and things

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:07.490
Tell your folks. I said okay. All right. Thank you. Bye-bye

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:16.930
Brother Williams that was very inspiring. Oh, thank you Brian. I'm glad you thought so. I want you to meet Joe and Mary

00:23:17.089 --> 00:23:23.009
This is their first meeting. Oh nice to meet you Joe and Mary. Yeah. Hey Gloria. Hey, brother Williams

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:29.490
I gotta tell you all of this is so different from my church. I mean, I liked your sermon

00:23:30.049 --> 00:23:33.009
But believe me we're not a family that expects to ever get rich

00:23:33.809 --> 00:23:35.809
We never have any money for anything anyways

00:23:36.769 --> 00:23:42.690
Right just a lot of debt. Yeah, but you know the important thing is that we can have our spiritual needs taken care of

00:23:43.329 --> 00:23:45.329
God can take care of all the other needs

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:47.490
Well, I'm glad you were able to make it today

00:23:47.809 --> 00:23:53.329
Hopefully this won't be your last time now maybe thanks again with the way it's take care. Yeah. Take care

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:58.769
Hey, so thanks for coming over man. I really appreciate the effort you made to come today. Yeah, man

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:01.650
It was good. I enjoyed it

00:24:02.049 --> 00:24:05.970
Speech as he gave it good. Yeah, man. Pretty nice. Yeah, so

00:24:06.849 --> 00:24:08.849
Don't see who did Mary think

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:16.049
Well, I know I got to check with her. Um, I mean, this is a lot different than her church. Yeah, so later on out

00:24:16.369 --> 00:24:21.569
I'll get her take on it too. Yeah, Brian. Thanks again brother Williams. Good to see you. I appreciate it

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:25.809
And Joe, this next meeting. Yeah. All right. Bye

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:30.740
Hey, Brian

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:32.900
Where's mr. Williams wife? He's a widower

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:38.660
Julia died a few years ago. Oh, but he took good care of her right to the end man. That's sad. Yeah

00:24:39.539 --> 00:24:41.539
Especially when it's your wife

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:46.819
Oh, but you know what he's convinced and we're all convinced we'll see her again in the new world

00:24:47.299 --> 00:24:54.660
And you know despite his grief he continues his work. Well, yeah, so how much does he make that? Oh, well, he doesn't make anything

00:24:54.660 --> 00:25:00.500
He's he's a volunteer volunteer. Yeah. Well, how does he afford that nice car? He's phone in his suit

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:05.940
Well, the congregation covers his basic expenses. What the congregation

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:11.299
When it sounds to me like he's living off others instead of working like you say. Oh, no, no, Joe

00:25:11.619 --> 00:25:16.019
You got it all wrong. He's busy. Just like the rest of us. He's he's busy preaching. He's

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:19.220
Preparing teaching listening to it. It's not like that

00:25:19.299 --> 00:25:23.859
Yeah, but you suppose he ever asked himself can I make it in this real world like you and I do every day?

00:25:24.019 --> 00:25:29.460
Joe trust me. He knows what this world is really like. I mean, he's in it every day helping people

00:25:30.259 --> 00:25:35.460
Sides before you learn the truth. He had a prestigious career. He just doesn't talk about it

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:38.420
Man, I got to go

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:44.500
Hey, Mary and we're trying to follow Bible principles as much as Mary. Yeah, you ready to go? I'm ready

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:48.339
Well, I gotta go so okay. I'll see you next time. Hey girls

00:25:49.619 --> 00:25:53.700
Yeah, we gotta get back. So thanks again, man. I'll see you next week. Mm-hmm. All right

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:56.500
All right

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:01.460
Really enjoyed by the Williams talk today

00:26:01.859 --> 00:26:05.299
The part where he said you cannot save for two masters

00:26:06.019 --> 00:26:09.220
You cannot serve God and riches. I really like that

00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:17.140
Yeah, brother Williams always gives nice talk, but are there many brothers who are successful in the world and in the truth too?

00:26:17.539 --> 00:26:19.539
How can you say you cannot do both?

00:26:19.539 --> 00:26:24.900
But Gloria it wasn't brother Williams who said no one could slay for two masters. It was Jesus. I know

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:28.900
But I see witnesses who were very active in the truth and also hold down

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:33.859
Your high-paying jobs some even pioneer. That's why you have to exert yourself

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:36.500
Gloria

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:40.579
Jesus said to exert yourself to get into the narrow door not to serve two masters

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:43.460
evidently lots wife tried to serve both

00:26:44.579 --> 00:26:46.579
But we live in different times though

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:52.660
Don't you think our girls need to try as hard as they can but think of those in our own congregation who push their kids too far

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:56.019
They couldn't do it all they had to take a break from the truth

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:58.660
So they could pursue their material goals

00:26:59.539 --> 00:27:01.700
So far they haven't returned to Jehovah

00:27:02.579 --> 00:27:05.539
Can you guys walk any faster? I don't want to miss my TV show

00:27:13.819 --> 00:27:19.420
So mom how was your baptism? What baptism didn't you get baptized this morning?

00:27:20.059 --> 00:27:25.339
How was it? Yeah, was it as good as dad said? Yeah, I enjoyed it

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:27.900
Everyone was so pleasant

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.940
It's not what I thought it would be. Are you serious? Yes, I'm serious

00:27:31.259 --> 00:27:34.140
We'll listen to a sermon and look up a lot of scriptures

00:27:35.099 --> 00:27:39.019
I couldn't even keep up. I didn't know the Bible had so many books

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:44.460
But you know now I can see why your dad's so interested. So what does that mean?

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:48.539
Yeah, like what happens now? Are you like ready to get baptized?

00:27:49.099 --> 00:27:51.099
Shall I baptize now now?

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:56.619
It's wrong with you. Stop that. You know both of you just get up and let me clean this table. Let's go

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:06.420
I told them that I would sit in the next time they came to study with your dad

00:28:07.059 --> 00:28:10.579
I got to keep my word. No, you don't you don't oldest people anything

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:14.180
Have they'll understand anyways? Listen that would be rude

00:28:14.579 --> 00:28:17.619
I'm many things, but I've never been rude besides

00:28:18.259 --> 00:28:20.900
I'm curious who knows what I could learn from all of this

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:35.250
Billis Menas so funny

00:28:37.089 --> 00:28:38.130
Mom

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:45.089
They're gay couple so a year ago that shocked you thinks change and we need to get used to it

00:28:50.269 --> 00:28:53.390
You see that's the only way to survive

00:28:54.349 --> 00:28:57.950
Your girls need to get big money jobs

00:28:58.589 --> 00:28:59.789
You have no choice

00:29:00.509 --> 00:29:04.589
Otherwise your sister-in-law and a family will look down on them

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:06.670
And on you

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:10.750
Mom why are you trying to even impress them? You don't even like those people

00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:21.140
Never mind

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:24.539
I'm studying school tomorrow

00:29:24.539 --> 00:29:27.339
School?

00:29:27.339 --> 00:29:28.140
You

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:30.940
What's going on?

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:35.339
I'm going to take a realistic glasses so that I can earn my own money

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:38.140
I want to move to better apartment

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:42.539
Mom, can you please speak to uncle for me about working for his real estate company?

00:29:42.539 --> 00:29:45.740
Now you talk like a good dad

00:29:51.579 --> 00:29:53.980
Next time on remember the wife of lot

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:56.779
What's going on? Why are you being so serious?

00:29:56.779 --> 00:29:58.779
I'm just trying to tell you that I love you all

00:29:58.779 --> 00:30:00.380
And I want what's best for us

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:03.180
Glory's mother keeps badgering her meat to move up

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:05.980
I'm just trying to make her happy

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:07.980
If I make the sale today

00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:11.980
I'll have enough to make down payment on the bigger apartment that I told you about

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:13.980
The one on the east side
