00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:05.940
Mary kept listening to what Jesus was saying.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.620
How commendable.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.699
She said the right priorities

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:11.539
and is a good example for us.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.699
Martha, her sister, however,

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:16.820
received loving correction from Jesus

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.620
as our printed comment puts it.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.899
Now, let us today put ourselves

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:24.820
in the shoes of Martha for a moment.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.739
She showed great interest in supporting Jesus

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:32.380
by providing him a base during his ministry

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.100
in the difficult area of Judea.

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:39.979
Now, this time, Mary and Martha were probably working together

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:42.659
to prepare things for Jesus.

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:45.100
But after Jesus arrived, Mary stopped helping

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.460
as our text indicates.

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:49.740
How did Martha feel about it?

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.460
Now, she had to care for everything herself.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.659
Can we imagine the tension rising

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.060
within Martha's heart,

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.140
the stress level increased,

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.700
and her dear sister sits and listens to Jesus.

00:01:08.379 --> 00:01:11.459
So she asked Jesus to correct Mary

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:13.459
to order her back to work.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.060
But to her surprise, she, Martha,

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.980
received counsel from Jesus.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.060
How would we feel in such a situation?

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.459
We are doing something well-intentioned

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.019
and yet instead of commendation, we receive counsel.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.900
Maybe our eyes fill with tears.

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:36.219
We feel the pain on our chest.

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:38.500
We might think we can't breathe anymore.

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:41.980
And did Martha think for a moment

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.939
replying to Jesus saying,

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:45.299
this is not fair.

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.140
I am doing everything to support you.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.659
And now this, you know, from now on,

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.340
I am listening to and I'm curious to find out

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.790
who prepares the meals for you.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.829
Of course, we don't know what Martha thought and said.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.909
But what we do know, as our printed comment puts it,

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.590
she took to heart Jesus' loving correction.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.229
What can help us to overcome such a painful moment

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:15.629
and to progress?

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.830
The term often used in this connection is resilience.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.310
People who are resilient are able to recover easily

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.349
and quickly from unpleasant and damaging events.

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.430
It is like the ability of this piece of metal

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.430
to tolerate pressure and get back to its original form.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.349
Let us therefore look at three factors

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.389
that make us resilient and different

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:48.389
from those who easily give up and surrender.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.150
Now, the first factor is facing reality.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.349
Facing reality.

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.789
Let us please open to Proverbs chapter 28.

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:02.710
The question we are asking ourselves

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.629
in a difficult moment is,

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.349
do I truly understand and accept the reality of my situation?

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.310
Here in Proverbs 28 verse 26, it starts by saying,

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:23.069
whoever trusts in his own heart is stupid.

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:28.990
We might tend to put on emotional blinders

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.110
and see only what we want to see.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.909
Many people slip into denial as a coping mechanism.

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:38.830
However, the Proverbs continues in the second part

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.830
by saying what the one who walks in wisdom will escape.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.110
This means seeing the things the way they are.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.909
Facing reality.

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:57.509
Really, facing reality is a grueling work.

00:03:57.509 --> 00:04:00.150
Indeed, it can be unpleasant

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.669
and often emotionally branching.

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:06.349
The Apostle Peter had this experience

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:10.349
when Jesus looked at him after Peter denied him three times.

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:12.990
Peter faced reality.

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.629
He went outside, broke down, wept bitterly.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.350
For sure, he was not looking for any excuses.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.790
This experience as well as other situations

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.870
where he received counsel helped him to make progress

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.350
and to fulfill his assignments even better.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.269
Now, what is the second factor?

00:04:34.269 --> 00:04:37.189
We call it meaning making.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.750
We might know people who under pressure

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.269
throw up their hands and cry and say,

00:04:44.269 --> 00:04:46.189
why can this happening to me?

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.310
Such people see themselves as victims

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.430
and living through hardship does not teach them any lessons.

00:04:55.709 --> 00:04:57.990
We, however, based on our Bible knowledge,

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.269
understand why difficulties and challenging situations

00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:02.750
are sometimes unavoidable.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.230
Seeing the bigger picture adds meaning.

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:09.990
This helps us as a resilient person

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.589
not only to endure an unpleasant situation

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:14.589
or a new circumstance,

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:18.189
but also to look at seeming obstacle

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:21.189
and see an opportunity in it.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.430
We all know no one is perfect.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.589
Everyone fails at something sometime.

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:35.629
So our choice is the manner in which we respond.

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:39.029
We are actively trying to make the best out of it,

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:43.230
looking ahead rather than behind.

00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:46.069
Setting goals, maybe new goals.

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:50.389
We might remember how Brother Harold King showed

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:52.829
this resilient disposition

00:05:52.829 --> 00:05:54.670
when he was in solitary confinement.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.389
How did he give meaning to his difficult situation

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:00.829
by making the best out of it?

00:06:00.829 --> 00:06:01.550
He said,

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.230
I arranged for a program of preaching activity,

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:10.389
but to whom does one preach when in solitary confinement?

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:15.189
I decided that I would build up some appropriate Bible sermons

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:17.589
from the things I could remember

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:20.990
and then preach to imaginary characters.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.990
End of quote.

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:25.589
So in our context, we can say,

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:28.990
meaning making is like building a bridge

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.189
from present-day hardship to a better future.

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:33.990
By means of this bridge,

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.589
we make the difficult situation manageable.

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:44.000
We remove the sense that the present is overwhelming.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.800
Now let's look at the third factor,

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.600
a balanced view of ourselves.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.399
While we said at the beginning

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:54.199
that we have to face reality

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:57.600
which can go along with feelings of sadness and disappointment

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.600
as resilient people,

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.600
we don't take the failure

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.399
or a challenging situation personally.

00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:09.399
Let us please open to Romans chapter seven

00:07:09.399 --> 00:07:11.399
because we want to demonstrate this point

00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:14.399
by the means of the example of the Apostle Paul.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.399
At times, he felt discouraged over his weaknesses.

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:22.399
Here in chapter seven,

00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:25.000
he describes the pain of conscience

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
that he suffered because of feeling captive to sin.

00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:33.399
But then in verse 24,

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.000
he cries out saying,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:43.420
miserable man that I am evidently though,

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:48.420
Paul realized that his imperfection did not define him.

00:07:49.339 --> 00:07:50.620
Nine years later,

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:55.019
in his second letter to his friend Timothy,

00:07:55.019 --> 00:07:56.720
shortly before his death,

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:00.420
he stated his personal conclusion of the matter.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:04.740
Here in second Timothy, chapter four in verse seven,

00:08:04.939 --> 00:08:07.810
he said,

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:10.810
I have fought the fine fight.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.709
I have run the race to the finish.

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:22.269
I have observed the faith.

00:08:22.269 --> 00:08:24.670
Paul's problems and inner struggle

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:26.870
did not miraculously disappear.

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:29.170
Still, it did not prevent him

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:31.769
from accomplishing remarkable things

00:08:31.769 --> 00:08:34.070
in Jehovah's service.

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:36.669
So therefore, we do not berate ourselves

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:39.570
with self-defeating language such as,

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:43.269
I'm a failure or I'm useless.

00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:47.370
Reflecting on positive aspects of our lives

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:50.169
and reflecting on our strengths helps us

00:08:50.169 --> 00:08:53.370
to maintain a balanced view of ourselves.

00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:56.070
So in conclusion,

00:08:57.169 --> 00:09:00.470
the experience of Martha reminded us today

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:02.870
of the importance of building

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:05.470
and maintaining resilience

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:07.870
by facing reality,

00:09:09.269 --> 00:09:10.470
meaning making,

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:14.669
and maintaining a balanced view of ourselves.
