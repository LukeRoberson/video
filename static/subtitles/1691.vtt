00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:12.580
My name is Narangirit, I was born and raised in Olambata, Mongolia.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.140
My father, my younger brother and I were in the army.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:24.339
During that time, I had money to buy whatever I wanted and enjoyed going drinking with

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:32.140
my friends, which made me feel better at times insatisfied and happy.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.060
But my stress with life quickly returned.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.380
One of my best friends started to study the Bible with Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:50.820
She used to give me tracks and talk about Jehovah often, but I never read them.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:59.579
One day, when I was feeling really down, I wondered what was in those tracks and decided

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:14.049
to read them.

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:16.370
I really liked what I read.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.879
I wanted to know more about it, so I called my friend and said, can you please teach

00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:28.840
me about the Bible?

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.719
Then I started to study the Bible and go into the meetings.

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:38.519
At one meeting I heard Jehovah God listens and answers his servant's prayers.

00:01:38.519 --> 00:01:41.959
This truth touched my heart.

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:48.760
I decided to learn more about God and to cultivate a close relationship with him and to worship

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.959
him.

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:55.599
I told my father about my decision to retire from the military.

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:58.200
Of course, he didn't want to accept it.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.239
He tried everything to stop me.

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:08.080
I felt bad that I was letting my family down.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.270
I really loved Jehovah.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:24.210
I never looked back, but I had another obstacle to overcome.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.050
I lived with my boyfriend.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.050
He never accepted the Bible truth.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.849
I loved both Jehovah and him.

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.129
I didn't want to lose either of them.

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:45.250
So I prayed to Jehovah, please help me that he legally marries me and let me be a servant

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.569
of you.

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.009
I did everything I could do.

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:58.599
But he said, if you don't leave this religion, I will never marry you.

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:03.479
Later he told me, I'm going abroad.

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:06.819
Come with me.

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:16.669
To be honest, I thought I could go with him and get married then become a servant of God.

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:23.270
But I prayed to Jehovah, please help me to make the right decision.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:29.310
When I realized that I had to cut off the relationship with him, who didn't want to marry

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:42.780
me, I cried until I had no tears left.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:50.740
I really loved him, but my love for Jehovah was much stronger.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:58.979
I was surprised at myself that I made this decision.

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:07.879
In March 2008, I was baptized and I started regular pioneering from that December.

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:15.080
I was appointed to be a special pioneer in August 2010, and I'm joyfully serving in

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.399
the city of Dharham.

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:32.949
I'm still single, but now I have many friends who love Jehovah and care for me.

00:04:32.949 --> 00:05:00.029
I have more self-respect than before.

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:09.670
For me, the real satisfaction and happiness come from working with Jehovah and serving him.

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:17.790
I have more self-respect than before, but now I have many friends who love Jehovah and care for me.
