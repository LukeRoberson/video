00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.620
So Peter, let's hear from you next.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:12.619
Well, when we informed everyone that the publishers were going to be redistributed to the north or south congregation,

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:21.899
let's just say some struggle with the idea.

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:33.899
Paula, did you see? They have us going to the south congregation and everybody else from our group is going to north.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.899
Yeah, I saw that. My aunt and cousins will be going there, too.

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.950
Well, that doesn't make any sense. They should keep you together.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.950
Well, at least the brothers said that the list was just a recommendation.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.950
Well, they didn't say it exactly like that. They said if we had extenuating circumstances.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.950
So you don't have to go if you don't want to go.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.950
But Kim, if everyone did that, don't you think?

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.950
Hi, sister Taylor. Oh, hello, girls. I saw your name on the list for the south congregation.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.950
But your grandkids and their families, they're going to north.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.950
So what are you going to do?

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.950
What do you mean?

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.030
Well, are you going to north or are you going to south?

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.030
Now, sweetie, didn't you say you saw my name listed under the south congregation?

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.030
Yeah, but so I'll be going to the south congregation.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:40.599
Well, don't you think it would make more sense if you were in the same congregation as your grandkids and their families?

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:44.010
Does it make more sense?

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:50.010
Well, that's a whole different question. The brothers outlined an arrangement.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.010
They said they hope we could support that arrangement.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:59.010
Unless we had extenuating circumstances and I don't have any right now.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.010
So for me, it's simple.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.010
Whether I do all of the reasons or not, I'm going to support that arrangement.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.479
Oh, look, girls, I've got to go.

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:15.479
Oh, and by the way, I hope to see you both in the south congregation.

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:27.849
I think this experience well illustrates one way to show courage now.

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.849
And that's by following the direction of the brothers taking the lead.

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:37.849
Even if we don't fully understand the reasons why this direction has been given.

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.849
Exactly.

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:44.849
We've been told when God of May, God, attacks Jehovah's people,

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.849
we may receive direction that may not seem practical.

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:56.849
So courageously following directions now will help us to do so then.

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:02.759
So brothers, we're almost done.

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:05.759
So brothers, we're almost done.

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:09.759
And if you don't mind, I'd like to share what happened with my group.

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:14.759
The Monroe's asked if I would join them on one of their family worship evenings.

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:17.759
So let's ask our final review question.

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:21.759
How can we prepare ourselves for the events that are to come?

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:23.759
Sarah?

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:28.759
We want to develop heartfelt obedience to the guidance that we receive now.

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:33.759
So that we'll obey any future instructions Jehovah may give us.

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:37.759
So doing this will help us survive Armageddon.

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.759
Well said.

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:43.520
Very nice to hear.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.520
May I ask Brad a question?

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.520
Sure.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.520
Go ahead.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.520
Brad, I noticed you've really been focused on that picture.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.599
You might have asked what you're thinking about.

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:02.599
Will the brothers tell us how to fight the people who will be attacking us?

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:04.599
We won't need to do any fighting.

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.599
Now what will we need the instructions for?

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.599
Are we just going to stand there and do nothing?

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.599
We don't know what those instructions will be, son.

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:20.600
Brad, when Armageddon comes, we'll have nothing to worry about.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.600
And we won't have to fight.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.600
We know that because of what Jehovah has done for us people in the past.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:36.600
I'd like to show you an account in 2 Chronicles chapter 20.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:43.600
It was a time when Moelbites and Ammonites started the war against the land of Judah,

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.600
who's been ruled by King Jehoshaphat.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:53.839
Some of those Israelites were likely anxious, just like you.

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:58.839
Jehoshaphat gathered Judah at the temple and began to inquire of Jehovah.

00:04:58.839 --> 00:05:07.920
And Jehovah caused the Levite named Jezile to give an answer that gave everyone courage.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.000
What did he say?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Do not be afraid or be terrified because of this large crowd.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
For the battle's not yours, but God's.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
You will not need to fight this battle.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Take your position, stand still, and see the salvation of Jehovah in your behalf.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:47.370
Jehovah turned the enemies against each other.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:56.269
By the time the Israelites arrived, now one soldier was left.

00:05:56.269 --> 00:06:01.269
It was obvious that Brad's courage was strengthened after reviewing this Bible account.

00:06:01.269 --> 00:06:09.269
And I'm happy to say that after our discussions, the friends in our group are more aware of how they own acts of courage now

00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:14.189
that will help them be courageous in the future.

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:17.189
Enough from me. It's your turn, Albert.
