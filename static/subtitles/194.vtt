00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.099
My theme is the King of the North in the time of the end.

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:13.099
In recent years, the Russian government has persecuted our brothers and sisters who live in that country.

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:19.100
You've heard reports about the police invading kingdom halls and breaking up meetings.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.100
The government has labeled Jehovah's Witnesses as an extremist group.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.100
It has seized our properties and imprisoned our brothers.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:38.799
Please watch a brief video that reviews some of the trials Jehovah's people in Russia have faced.

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:49.490
On April 20, 2017, the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation criminalized the activity of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:57.490
As of July 4, 2019, authorities have progressively seized 131 of the properties owned by Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.490
with an additional 60 properties subject to confiscation.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.489
One of the seized properties was the former Russia branch complex in Solishnoia.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:13.219
At the time of filming, the Russian authorities continued their aggressive attack on Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:21.219
As of August 17, 2020, there were 42 witnesses who were in pre-trial attention or sentenced to prison people.

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:27.219
32 who were under house arrest and 169 who were not allowed to leave their hometown.

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:37.219
All have been charged with organizing, participating in or financing the activity of so-called extremist organization.

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:45.219
At least 380 witnesses were at the time under investigation, ranging in age from 19 to 89 years old.

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:49.219
What has this meant for the individuals affected?

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:56.219
As an example, on June 3, 2018, whether Sergei Klymov was arrested.

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:03.219
Local authorities initiated criminal charges against him, placing him in pre-trial detention for two months.

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:14.219
This detention was extended seven times, separating him from his wife and family for a year and five months before he was finally tried and sentenced.

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:20.219
On November 5, 2019, he was sentenced to six years in prison.

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:29.569
Two of our dear young people in Russia, whether Yegor Baranov and Sister Daria Dulova,

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.569
are courageously facing criminal conviction and potential long-term imprisonment.

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.569
Whether Baranov is only 19 years old.

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:45.490
When the authorities raided her home, Sister Dulova was only 18 years old.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.490
By means of the newsroom on JWWorg, we're informed of updated news events.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.490
This page includes links to name lists of witnesses currently in prison for their faith,

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.490
which can help us include them specifically in our prayers.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:04.490
Our brothers and sisters in Russia are resolved to remain loyal to Yegor, despite any opposition.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:10.490
And they put their confidence in him in the assurance that Yehova is on their side.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:31.840
It shouldn't surprise us that this powerful government has been persecuting our peaceful law-abiding brothers and sisters.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.840
Why not? Because that government is fulfilling Bible prophecy.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.840
Please find Daniel chapter 11.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.840
In verse 40, it refers to what the Bible calls the King of the North.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.840
Of that King, Daniel 11.41 says,

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.840
he will also enter into the land of the decoration,

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.840
and many lands will be made to stumble.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:09.840
Today, Russia and its allies are filling the role of the King of the North.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.840
Daniel foretold that this King would enter the land of the decoration,

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:21.839
meaning that he would interfere in a significant way with the activities of God's people.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:24.839
As discussed in the May 2020 watchtower,

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:30.839
Russia and its allies are not the first political power to act as the King of the North,

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:34.839
but they may well be the last.

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:38.839
In this program, we will do three things.

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:45.839
First, we'll briefly trace the fulfillment of the prophecy recorded in Daniel chapter 11.

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:51.839
Second, we'll look at how that prophecy is being fulfilled today.

00:04:51.839 --> 00:05:00.839
And third, we'll discuss how knowing this information should affect the decisions that we make.

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:04.839
Brother Herman Vansom, a helper to the writing committee,

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:12.839
will help us review some of the key points of the prophecy recorded in Daniel 11.

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:15.839
Thank you, Herman, for helping me with this presentation.

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:18.839
It's a pleasure to be with you, Ken.

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:21.839
Thank you for inviting me.

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:28.839
First, let's briefly trace how the prophecy has been fulfilled so far.

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:34.839
The prophecy in Daniel 11 mentions the King of the North and the King of the South.

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:37.839
Now, why are they described like that?

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:45.839
Well, initially these powers were located north and south of the literal land of Israel,

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:50.839
thus the names King of the North and King of the South.

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:54.839
These powers could be viewed as two thrones.

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:59.839
Over time, those thrones have been occupied by various political powers

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:03.839
and these rival kings compete for world domination.

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:06.839
And what about Jehovah's people?

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:11.839
They are right at the center of this conflict.

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:14.839
But let's start at the beginning.

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:20.839
Ken, what is the origin of the kings of the North and of the South?

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:28.839
The kings of the North and of the South both rose from the empire established by Alexander the Great.

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:33.839
One line of kings ruled over Egypt, which is south of Israel,

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:39.839
and that dynasty was the first to fill the role of King of the South.

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:44.839
During this period, another line of kings ruled an area north of Israel,

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:49.839
and those kings filled the role of King of the North.

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:56.250
Then, the Roman Empire took over as King of the North.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.250
As discussed in the May 2020 watchtower,

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:06.250
God's people are the focal point of the prophecy recorded in Daniel chapter 11.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:12.250
The angel who spoke with Daniel said that the prophecy would help him understand

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:18.250
what will befall your people, that is the nation of Israel.

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:21.250
And what in fact happened?

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:26.250
Well, the Jewish nation was God's people until 33CE.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.250
But after that, a change occurred.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:33.250
Jehovah poured out his Holy Spirit on Christ's followers,

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:40.850
and from then on, the congregation of true Christians became God's people.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:47.850
Galatians 6 verse 16 refers to them as the Israel of God.

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:52.850
That point is significant, because the kings of the North and South

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:59.850
can only be identified when there is a clearly defined group of God's people on earth.

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:01.850
Why is that the case?

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:10.850
Because, as we just considered, the angel had told Daniel that the prophecy centers on God's people.

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:19.850
In the second century CE, true Christians were overgrown by wheat-like false Christians.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:25.850
In this illustration of the wheat and the weeds, Jesus foretold that this would happen.

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:31.850
That illustration is recorded at Matthew 13 verses 36 to 43.

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:39.850
So, from the second century onward, we can no longer identify an organized group of true Christians

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:47.850
and, as we considered, for that same reason, we also cannot identify the king of the North and the king of the South.

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:55.850
But, in the 1870s, a group of Bible students began to separate itself from false Christians.

00:08:55.850 --> 00:09:03.850
This group, which included Charles T. Russell, rejected teachings that were not based on the Bible.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:10.850
And, like the first century Christians, they promoted the truths taught in God's Word.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:17.850
Now, this group underwent a development that is foretold at Malachi chapter 3 verse 1.

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:24.850
They were the messenger who would clear up a way before Jehovah.

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:30.850
And, as events that followed proof, this group clearly had God's backing.

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:37.850
So, from the 1870s onward, when true Christians began to organize themselves as a group,

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:46.850
we can again identify the political powers that fill the roles of the king of the North and king of the South.

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:56.850
At that time in history, Britain was the dominant political force, and it filled the role of the king of the South.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:06.850
It was also in the 1870s that the German Empire emerged and soon began to challenge Britain for world domination.

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:12.850
This political power now filled the role of the king of the North.

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:23.850
Daniel 11, verse 25 and 26, indicate that the two kings would clash and that the king of the North would lose many soldiers in the battle.

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:28.850
And that is exactly what happened during World War I.

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:37.850
And it was during that war that Britain and its close ally, the United States, forged a special bond.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:47.850
So, from this point on during these last days, the Anglo-American power has been the king of the South.

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:50.850
That brings us to our second point.

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:59.850
How has Daniel 11 been fulfilled from that time onward until recent times?

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:09.850
During World War I, the king of the North and the king of the South persecuted those of God's people who refused to fight in the war.

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:15.850
The king of the South even threw into jail those who were taking the lead in the preaching work.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:19.850
But let's take a closer look at the king of the North.

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:25.850
Has the political power filling that role changed during the last days?

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:28.850
And how has it treated God's people?

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:34.850
The identity of the king of the North has changed three times during the last days.

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:44.850
Starting in the 1870s, through to the end of the Second World War, the German Empire filled the role of the king of the North.

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:58.850
In the period leading up to and including World War II, it persecuted God's people without mercy, imprisoning thousands of our brothers and killing hundreds of them.

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:02.850
Who replaced the German Empire as the king of the North?

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:05.850
That's an important question, Herman.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:16.850
After World War II, the Soviet Union took on that role. It also attacked God's people, imprisoning them or sending them into exile.

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:29.850
But can Daniel 11 for 34 says that they, that is God's people, would be given a little help? What's the significance of that statement?

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:34.850
This passage points forward to the time when the Soviet Union collapsed.

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:43.850
Although God's people suffered terribly under that government, they were given a little help in what way?

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:50.850
After the USSR collapsed, God's people there could worship freely for a number of years.

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:57.850
In time, though, Russia and its allies took on the role of the king of the North.

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:06.850
And like the other powers that filled the role of King of the North, this government has continued to oppress God's people.

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:13.850
How are our brothers and sisters coping with the current persecution? Let's take a look.

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:23.309
And what you're going to see will break your heart, but also strengthen your faith.

00:13:23.309 --> 00:13:28.309
At 6 a.m., my husband and I were woken up by a loud bang on the door.

00:13:28.309 --> 00:13:34.309
As soon as my husband had opened the door, people burst in shouting, everyone on the floor.

00:13:34.309 --> 00:13:41.309
I saw them taking my husband into the kitchen and heard them very aggressively ordering him to do something.

00:13:41.309 --> 00:13:46.309
Then I heard some noise and I realized that he was being beaten.

00:13:46.309 --> 00:13:52.309
My husband Felix and I were on our way back from the shopping mall to the car park.

00:13:52.309 --> 00:14:00.309
A jeep with tinted windows blocked our path and people with weapons jumped out shouting, on the ground, don't move.

00:14:00.309 --> 00:14:03.309
We were thrown against the vehicle.

00:14:03.309 --> 00:14:08.309
Felix was sent to a pretrial detention facility where he spent a year.

00:14:08.309 --> 00:14:17.460
From the very first bang on the door, I began praying to Jehovah for wisdom, calmness and for Holy Spirit

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:23.460
so that I could make the right decisions and act in the right way and for the whole day I was praying.

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:28.460
Jehovah answered all my prayers and I felt that he was close at my side.

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:39.240
Before each court hearing, when I was very afraid and felt overwhelmed by emotion and couldn't calm myself down,

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:42.240
it was prayer that helped me to settle down.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:53.899
When they took us for interrogation, I started panicking and at that moment I realized that I needed to meditate on something positive.

00:14:53.899 --> 00:15:01.899
So I thought, I need to sing our songs and just one song came into my mind, he will make you strong.

00:15:01.899 --> 00:15:10.899
It really strengthened me, those words about how a Jehovah gave his son for us, shows he loves us and will never leave us.

00:15:10.899 --> 00:15:18.389
Brothers and sisters pray and tell me that they are praying for me.

00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:27.259
It gives me the feeling that I am part of a large family.

00:15:27.259 --> 00:15:30.259
After the interrogation, he was sent home.

00:15:30.259 --> 00:15:34.259
My husband and I continued to stick to our spiritual routine.

00:15:34.259 --> 00:15:40.259
We continued to conduct family worship and we are always in the ministry.

00:15:40.259 --> 00:15:44.259
Our brothers and sisters constantly support us.

00:15:44.259 --> 00:15:50.259
They write kind words, they commend us, they send us encouraging scriptures from the Bible.

00:15:50.259 --> 00:16:01.799
In September 2019, Felix was found guilty and sentenced to three years in a general regime colony.

00:16:01.799 --> 00:16:07.799
When he and the other brothers arrived there, they were beaten up by officers from the colony.

00:16:07.799 --> 00:16:14.879
Felix told me that he prayed while he was being beaten.

00:16:14.879 --> 00:16:19.879
And he noticed that at that moment he stopped feeling the pain.

00:16:19.879 --> 00:16:28.600
While he is behind bars, Felix tries to conduct family worship with me by letters.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:33.600
He picks certain themes and some specific questions.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:37.600
Then I do research in the publications and send back what I find.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:43.450
The scripture at Isaiah 30 really strengthens me.

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:49.450
Where it says that your strength will be in keeping calm and showing trust.

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:57.450
Although I tend to worry, I understood that calmness is expressed by fully trusting in Jehovah.

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:10.359
I have become stronger because thanks to Jehovah, in a way I have developed almost a shell against the difficulties that used to scare me.

00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:13.359
That confidence and faith help me.

00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:17.359
Jehovah was with me and he will remain close by me.

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:20.359
And we will be made stronger thanks to him.

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:23.359
And we will get through these trials.

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:32.210
How can we develop courage like our brothers and sisters in Russia?

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:40.210
Well, we must be convinced that the prophecy in the Bible are trustworthy.

00:17:42.099 --> 00:17:51.099
As we have discussed, each detail of the prophecy recorded at Daniel 11 has come true so far.

00:17:51.099 --> 00:17:58.099
We must have confidence that the remaining events described in that prophecy will also come true.

00:17:58.099 --> 00:18:03.099
We are living in the last days of the time of the end.

00:18:03.099 --> 00:18:11.099
Soon, the nations will fulfill the prophecy at 1 Thessalonians 5-3.

00:18:11.099 --> 00:18:23.099
Whenever it is that they are saying peace and security, then sudden destruction is to be instantly on them just like birth pains on a pregnant woman.

00:18:23.099 --> 00:18:27.099
And they will by no means escape.

00:18:27.099 --> 00:18:33.099
Then sudden destruction comes upon all parts of Satan's system.

00:18:33.099 --> 00:18:38.099
As you can see on the screen, Daniel 121 says,

00:18:38.099 --> 00:18:42.099
During that time, Michael will stand up.

00:18:42.099 --> 00:18:46.099
The great prince who is standing in behalf of your people.

00:18:46.099 --> 00:18:54.099
And there will occur a time of distress such as has not occurred since there came to be a nation until that time.

00:18:54.099 --> 00:18:58.099
And during that time, your people will escape.

00:18:58.099 --> 00:19:03.099
Hey, everyone who has found written down in the book.

00:19:03.099 --> 00:19:07.099
That leads us into our third point.

00:19:07.099 --> 00:19:15.099
How should knowing the information that we have just discussed affect the decisions that we make?

00:19:15.099 --> 00:19:19.099
Well, what we have reviewed is not just interesting history.

00:19:19.099 --> 00:19:25.099
It's a dramatic prelude to what will soon happen here on Earth.

00:19:25.099 --> 00:19:30.099
Jehovah has given his people this knowledge so that we can act on it.

00:19:30.099 --> 00:19:35.099
It should influence the choices we make.
