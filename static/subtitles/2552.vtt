00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:04.419
We begin with a report from Ukraine.

00:00:04.419 --> 00:00:13.419
In 2014, political tensions in eastern Ukraine boiled over into a full-blown military conflict.

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:20.420
Within months, over 7,600 witnesses needed to flee the area to seek refuge.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.420
Others sheltered in their homes.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.420
How did our brothers survive physically and spiritually through the fighting?

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.420
Relief was organized from hundreds of miles away at the branch office in Lviv.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:42.420
In the following interviews, our brothers and sisters described the love and care they received from the organization and from each other.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:01:06.109
It happened, but the hostility started without warning, and the brothers needed to flee quickly.

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:18.450
There was not enough food, there was nothing in the stores, there was lack of medicine, there was no water, no electricity.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.450
It was scary, there was no stability at all, we did not know what to do.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.450
Should we stay or should we leave?

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.879
There were triplets, there were seven years old.

00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:37.879
As soon as they got into the shelter, they started singing a kingdom song.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.500
The adults also joined them in singing, and because of that, we couldn't hear the explosions that were happening outside.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:02:01.670
True, we ran out of foodstuffs, and we had no money, but I knew we would be able to get by. God would not let us die of hunger.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.670
Because the shelling was happening so often, it was impossible to conduct our usual meetings.

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:14.669
We also could organize the ministry in the normal way. It was just too dangerous.

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:22.669
When we received the first reports about the unrest in the east, our branch communicated and we prayerfully analyzed the situation.

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:29.669
We asked Jehovah for wisdom, how to act, how to help our brothers to be spiritually and physically safe.

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:33.669
We also sending regular updates reports to the governing body.

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:46.669
More than 156 tons of food and 21 tons of clothing donated by local brothers have been distributed to fellow believers and also to some non-witnesses.

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:56.669
We had been told that we would be receiving about 5 tons of relief supplies, so we were astounded when instead of 5 tons, we received 15 tons.

00:02:56.669 --> 00:03:02.669
It was lovely to find little notes that our brothers and sisters had written and included in the packages.

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:15.669
Brothers from neighboring cities responded and offered their homes, provided foodstuffs, and more importantly, their brotherly hospitality.

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:26.669
So we are ready to make sacrifices to adjust our schedules and even take time out from our families to run the practical help to our brothers.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:39.189
For example, beginning at 6 a.m., I would visit the brothers and sisters and bring them the things that they needed.

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:51.189
So, during two and a half months of war and two months of reconstruction, I wrote my bicycle 6,500 kilometers.

00:03:51.189 --> 00:04:00.189
The local elders from Slaviansk organized small congregations and regularly conducted meetings to support them spiritually.

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:10.189
Major repairs have been carried out on 20 houses of brothers and sisters, and minor repair work was done on 72 houses and apartments.

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:20.189
We prepared two more programs, this time not only for the congregations in the Warsaw, but for the whole country of Ukraine, even for Russia and Belarus.

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:24.189
We even had 325,000 in attendance.

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:31.189
An interesting experience was the response of the people who were not Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:42.189
They belonged to another religion, yet they said, you are the only ones that really care. Your genuine love is shown by your deeds.

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:49.189
This is what makes us different from all other religions.

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:55.189
They some selfish love, shown by our brothers, did not go unnoticed by my husband and my son.

00:04:56.189 --> 00:05:06.189
My husband started studying the Bible, and he regularly attends the meetings now. Recently, he enrolled in the Socratic Ministry School.

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:13.189
I experienced this love personally, and I started studying the Bible again with the brothers.

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:21.189
Now, I am preparing for baptism. Unfortunately, one of our sisters was killed.

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:31.189
I realized that a person can lose everything, but that is really nothing compared to losing your children.

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:38.189
The brothers and sisters listened to us, we cried together. I just can't put it into words.

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:48.189
It is as if Jehovah is holding you in his arms. He doesn't let you fall, as if he's saying to you, don't let go my dear one.

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:53.189
I am helping you. I am supporting you.

00:05:53.189 --> 00:06:03.110
With Jehovah, there are no borders between nations. I could see that this is the true religion.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:13.110
We continue to pray for our brothers in Ukraine. We are confident of Jehovah's love for them, and we know he will sustain them through any tribulation.
