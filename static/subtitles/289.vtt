00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
My husband did not recognize me for three days.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It was a very dark time.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.750
We went to BSCC Bible School for Christian Couples in January of 2014.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.750
It definitely helped prepare us for everything that would come our way.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.750
The good and the bad.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.750
We were assigned to Jackson, Alabama.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.750
It was a great assignment.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.750
But then a very short time we were asked to apply for LDC.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.750
We traveled quite a bit, looking at different assembly halls.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.750
And then the focus went more toward Keenem halls.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.750
Each field rep couple was assigned a state.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.750
And we were assigned the state of Louisiana.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.750
On a Sunday night we had been invited to a dinner party.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.750
Just a normal went to bed at night.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.750
We basically woke up to a stroke.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.750
I walked over to him and I could see that something was wrong.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.750
And so I called 911.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.750
Once they assessed him, they brought me in, told me that they needed to life light him

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.750
to a larger hospital in New Orleans.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.750
Thankfully, though, they said if you're going to have a stroke,

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.750
this was the kind you'd want to have because it is fully recoverable.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.750
We made adjustments.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.750
We adapted so that we could continue in the assignment.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.750
Well, he went from being a wheelchair to being on a walker.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.750
And then later he started using a cane.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.750
And then now he walks without assistance.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.750
It's not a pretty walk, but we're working on that.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:47.750
She really has a durability that I think excels just the way that she,

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.750
no matter what situation, how stressful the circumstances may be.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.750
She understands it's necessary for her to continue forward.
