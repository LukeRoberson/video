00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:07.900
I've known James and Linda well forever.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:23.879
They were there when my family fell away and I fell away.

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:35.520
I knew it was the truth.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.520
I just wanted more.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:01:00.219
But when the pandemic hit, I knew the end was close.

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:12.019
I started studying again and got baptized just in time.

00:01:12.019 --> 00:01:32.540
He keeps passing this blog information and asking for everyone's opinion.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.540
I saw it.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.540
It's the third one this week.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.780
I'll talk to him.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.780
He just needs to verify his sources.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.459
Did you get a chance to read the links I sent you?

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:52.459
Of course I read it.

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:55.459
And it's exciting to think we could be so close.

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:59.459
And when you watch the news, you realize it could be any day now.

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:01.459
What's all the excitement?

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:03.459
The cry of peace and security.

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:05.459
Thanks again for sharing.

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:07.959
See you.

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:09.960
Too lonely.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.960
Remember Jesus said.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.960
No one knows the day or hour.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.960
But he said we should keep on the watch.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.960
I think it's great you're keeping the end close in mind.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.960
Because of you and Linda, both of you have shown me how close we really are.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.490
I have to take this quickly.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.490
But I'll see you on Friday.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:42.509
I saw what was happening in the world and you both helped me.

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:44.509
Put it all together.

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:48.509
We just want to be sure you are focused on the right things.

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:54.509
We can all start thinking too much about when the end will come.

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:57.509
But I'm just being alert.

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:59.509
Isn't that what you taught me to do?

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:01.509
A alert is good.

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:04.509
And if the end is really so far off,

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:07.509
why did I need to change my life now?

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:29.020
You are asking the right questions.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:35.020
There was a moment in our lives when we focused too much on the wind.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.020
Rather than the why we were saving Jehovah.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:49.020
It affected our zeal, our happiness, our perspective.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.020
And we never want that for you.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.379
This is the answer.

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:06.500
Since all these things are to be dissolved in this way,

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.500
consider what sort of people you ought to be in holy acts of conduct

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.500
and deeds of godly devotion.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:20.329
We don't know when the end will come.

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:26.170
Could be tomorrow.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.170
It could take a little longer.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:35.170
But what matters is the kind of person we are.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.170
When it comes.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:42.860
So focus on your love for Jehovah,

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:52.310
his organization, his work.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:59.310
Take the excitement you have and direct it to the right way.
