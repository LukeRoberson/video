00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.500
Go to the wilderness.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.599
That would make a terrible advertisement on a travel website, wouldn't it?

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.400
Right next to pictures of beaches, cruise liners, and ski resorts.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.600
Why would anyone want to go to the wilderness?

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.800
Here's one reason.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.600
Open your Bible to Matthew 14, 13.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.600
Now, the earlier part of this chapter relates how John the baptizer was beheaded.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.799
No one saw this coming, not even Jesus, the suddenness, gruesomeness,

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:43.000
an enormous injustice of John's execution led to what we read at Matthew 14, 13.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.299
At hearing this, Jesus departed from their by boat into an isolated place to be alone.

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:52.500
Let's stop there.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.299
The Greek word for isolated place is elsewhere translated wilderness.

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.700
In this verse, one Bible renders it a place where there were no people.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.000
This wasn't the only time Jesus went to such a place.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.099
For example, Matthew 4.1 says after his baptism,

00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:15.500
Jesus was led by this spirit into the wilderness.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.700
Now, why?

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.400
Well, think about what had just happened.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.900
Matthew 3.16 says that Jesus' baptism, the heavens were opened up.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.299
According to the study note, that expression might mean that at that moment,

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.680
Jehovah restored Jesus' memory of his pre-human life in heaven.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:44.280
Now, we can't fathom what that moment must have been like.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.280
I mean, even a blade of grass would look different to Jesus now

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.780
because now he could recall things about its creation.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.180
Historical accounts like the deluge, the parting of the red sea,

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.980
the fall of Adam and Eve.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.480
Jesus didn't need to imagine those events anymore.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.680
It's likely he could remember them now just as they occurred.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.180
He was in heaven alive when they happened.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.979
Now, to process his restored memory and much more,

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.680
Jesus needed to go to the wilderness for 40 days.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.180
To wonder, he didn't need 40 weeks, right?

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.680
But the point is, at times Jesus needed solitude

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.479
and he made sure that he got it.

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:38.379
And not just on rare occasions, Luke 5.16 says, and I quote,

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.580
he often went into the desolate areas.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.879
We need to do that, too.

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:48.479
To go to the wilderness, in a figurative sense,

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:51.680
to create periods of solitude in our life,

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.379
to study God's Word, to pray, to be alone with our own thoughts.

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.580
But today, many people view solitude as distasteful,

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.479
something to avoid.

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:08.379
One Watchtower article includes this statement.

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:10.780
We seem so frightened today of being alone

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.080
that we never let it happen.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.639
Another Watchtower article says,

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:20.080
simplicity of living has been replaced by a life of complexity.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.280
People today fear being alone with their own thoughts.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.280
Now, the Watchtower articles I just quoted were published

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.379
in the 1950s.

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.080
Back then, the big electronic threats to solitude

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.180
were TV and radio.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.680
And the Watchtower called that a life of complexity.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.879
At the time, it was.

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:55.620
But now we have this, and this, and even this.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.919
There's always some device ringing,

00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:59.719
dinging, or buzzing.

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:02.319
If we power off, we get anxious.

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:07.919
What if I miss something good, or what if someone needs me?

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:10.219
Even our sense of duty tells us,

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:13.419
shouldn't I always be available?

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:16.420
Try to spend just one hour in the wilderness

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.519
with all the interruptions we only get fractions of an hour,

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.420
what's been called a mess of minutes.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.220
We shouldn't just accept that as an inevitable part

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.319
of modern living.

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:31.920
Instead, we should view it as all the more reason

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.519
to make sure we have periods of solitude in our life

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:40.319
to study God's Word, to pray, to meditate.

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:47.649
We need to take time to go to the wilderness, like Jesus did.

00:04:47.649 --> 00:04:50.550
But let's be honest, that's hard to do.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.750
Our plans for solitude can be disrupted.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.649
It happened to Jesus in the account we read earlier

00:04:55.649 --> 00:04:58.350
at Matthew 14.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.250
In fact, the second part of Matthew 14 13

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.750
says that the crowd followed him into the wilderness.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.649
So what did Jesus do?

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:08.649
Well, verse 14 says,

00:05:08.649 --> 00:05:13.449
he took the time to cure their sick ones.

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:16.949
Verses 19 to 21, he even fed them.

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:20.949
But does that mean Jesus sacrificed his solitude

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:23.449
for the sake of people?

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:24.449
Not at all.

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.449
Look at verses 22 and 23.

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:30.550
And notice what Jesus did after he fed the crowd.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.350
Then without delay, he made his disciples board the boat

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.550
and go ahead of him to the opposite shore.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.250
While he sent the crowds away,

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.649
after sending the crowds away,

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:46.850
he went up on the mountain by himself to pray.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:52.550
When evening came, he was there alone.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.449
So Jesus got his solitude after all.

00:05:57.449 --> 00:05:59.250
But how did it come about?

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.449
Let's look closer at two statements in verse 22.

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:06.750
First, he made his disciples board the boat

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.449
and go ahead of him to the opposite shore.

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:12.949
According to a translation handbook,

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:15.750
the original language word for he made

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.850
has a sense of urgency to it

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.550
and can mean he compelled or even forced.

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.149
What does that tell us?

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:26.550
Jesus realized he wouldn't have solitude

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.649
unless he made it happen.

00:06:29.649 --> 00:06:34.850
Now we too need to make room for solitude in our schedule.

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.649
For example, if our social calendar is so full

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:42.949
that we have no time for study, prayer, and meditation,

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:47.050
we need to take control like Jesus did.

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:51.250
To help us do that, the December 8, 1987 awake article,

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.449
time or you, it's master or it's slave,

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:56.850
gives this advice, do not feel obligated

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:01.250
to accept every social invitation that comes your way.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.850
Learn to say no tactfully.

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:08.649
Now, on those occasions,

00:07:08.649 --> 00:07:11.250
when we do need to say no,

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:14.649
we might feel like we're putting our friends on a boat

00:07:14.649 --> 00:07:17.550
and sending them to the opposite shore.

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:21.980
And in a sense, we are.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:25.079
But we're not being cruel.

00:07:25.079 --> 00:07:27.579
And we won't lose them as friends.

00:07:27.579 --> 00:07:29.779
They're spiritual people, so they'll understand.

00:07:29.779 --> 00:07:33.079
They can't say yes to everything either.

00:07:33.079 --> 00:07:35.879
Not if it crowds out all their time

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:39.980
for study, prayer, and meditation.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.079
Our friends also value their opportunities

00:07:43.079 --> 00:07:46.399
to go to the wilderness.

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:49.899
Now, the second statement in verse 22,

00:07:49.899 --> 00:07:52.500
Jesus sent the crowds away.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.600
Notice he didn't wait for them to make the first move.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.300
No, he sent them away.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.899
What does that tell us?

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:09.300
That even if some people wanted more from Jesus,

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.600
he wasn't always available.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.399
And he didn't feel guilty about it.

00:08:15.399 --> 00:08:18.699
Jesus needed uninterrupted periods of solitude

00:08:18.699 --> 00:08:21.800
for prayer and meditation.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.399
After all, if he didn't maintain a spiritual strength,

00:08:25.399 --> 00:08:30.500
eventually he'd be of no help to anyone.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.299
Now, like Jesus at times,

00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:34.799
we might need to send the crowds away.

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:39.200
In other words, to make sure our solitude isn't interrupted.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.299
For example, as we study,

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:45.299
we might want to turn off notifications on our devices.

00:08:45.299 --> 00:08:46.700
Send the crowds away.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.700
It's just for a little while.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:50.899
You know, researchers say

00:08:50.899 --> 00:08:53.500
that the mere presence of a phone can distract us.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:58.500
So if we're the type that can't stop checking for messages,

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.000
we might even need to put our phone in another room.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.500
The point is, whatever it takes,

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:09.200
we don't want to deprive ourselves of the benefits

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.679
that solitude can bring.

00:09:12.679 --> 00:09:15.179
Now, one final point, verse 25,

00:09:15.179 --> 00:09:17.879
says Jesus didn't return to his disciples

00:09:17.879 --> 00:09:19.980
until the fourth watch.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:24.279
That's somewhere between 3 and 6 a.m.

00:09:24.279 --> 00:09:26.980
What does that tell us?

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:32.879
Jesus didn't sacrifice his solitude for the sake of people.

00:09:32.879 --> 00:09:38.080
He sacrificed his sleep for the sake of solitude.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.080
People were important to Jesus,

00:09:40.179 --> 00:09:43.779
but not at the expense of his spiritual condition.

00:09:43.779 --> 00:09:48.080
And that's why he made it a point to go to the wilderness

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.980
and to do it often.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:55.080
Now, if Jesus, the perfect son of God needed to do that,

00:09:55.080 --> 00:10:01.169
how much more so do we in our imperfect condition?

00:10:01.169 --> 00:10:04.370
Now, you students of the 157th class of Gilead

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:07.570
will be going to your assignments with added training,

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:12.570
added responsibility, and added demands.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.370
After all, Luke 1248 says,

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:19.470
everyone to whom much was given, much will be demanded.

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:23.470
But no matter how many demands your assignment may bring,

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:27.169
don't neglect your need for uninterrupted private time

00:10:27.169 --> 00:10:31.570
to study God's Word, to pray, to meditate.

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:34.169
You will draw closer to Jehovah

00:10:34.169 --> 00:10:36.470
and be a greater asset to his people

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:40.870
if you value your opportunities to go to the wilderness.
