00:00:05.139 --> 00:00:11.599
Oh, hospitable?

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.599
Hmm, what does that mean?

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.600
It's a quality mission in the Bible.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.600
We can be hospitable by being kind to others

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.600
and making them feel welcome.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.600
Does it make you happy when others share with you?

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.600
Hospitality is like sharing,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.600
but it's not just about sharing what you have.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.600
It's about how we feel on the inside when we do it.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.600
Because we love others.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.600
There are many ways to be hospitable.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.600
You can make others feel welcome when they visit your congregation.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.600
Hello, my name is Sophia.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.600
It's so nice to meet you.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.600
Welcome to our congregation.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.600
My name is Caleb.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.600
Do you like dinosaurs?

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.600
Yeah!

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:05.099
You can also make others feel welcome when they come to your home.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:10.840
You can even share a meal together.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.709
I wonder who that could be.

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:19.709
Oh, I invited the whole congregation.

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:29.030
Make sure you have your parents' permission before you invite someone over.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.030
And remember, we don't need to have a lot of things to be hospitable.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.340
Some of the most precious things we can share with others

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.340
is our time and attention.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.280
So, can we invite someone over?

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.290
Sure.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.290
Who did you have in mind?

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:59.549
Sounds like a wonderful idea.
