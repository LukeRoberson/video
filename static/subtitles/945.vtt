00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:11.460
As long as we live in Satan's world, all of us will face situations that can rob us of our peace.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.460
Regaining that peace can be difficult, but not impossible.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:29.460
In this video, we will hear from three sisters and two couples who will speak candidly about their trials and how they struggle to cope with them.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:42.460
But in spite of what they have endured, please take note of their smiles, their joy, what they did to regain or maintain their peace.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:50.020
And take special note of how Jehovah helped them.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:59.020
The governing body knows that many of you are suffering circumstances not unlike the ones we will hear about.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:10.019
And they trust that the examples in this video will help each of you to maintain your peace as you endure various trials.

00:01:10.019 --> 00:01:36.439
Brothers and sisters all over the world are facing natural disasters, economic collapse, illness, persecution, despite all that, they keep joy and peace.

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:41.640
I can learn a lot from them.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:53.189
My name is Antoineette. I live here in Las Vegas, Nevada with my super mom and my trouble making sister.

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.189
Family and friends have always been important to me.

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:09.189
As a child, I lived with my mom and dad, and I was very close to my dad's side. The family was very loving, unified, and fun.

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:13.189
I was pretty happy.

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:19.189
But Ari was starting to feel the effects of my cancer. We just didn't know what it was really.

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:24.189
One day I was okay and the next day I started feeling bad, you know.

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:40.870
In my childhood, I played an unusual game. I would catch insects, put them in a jar, and then bring them home.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:51.460
Then I would get books, such as a criminal procedural code. Open them up and start judging one of the books.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.460
I would play the role of investigator and judge at the same time.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:08.129
I was born into a family where everyone, starting with my grandparents, was either wearing an officer's uniform or a judge's robe.

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:22.169
That's why I had this strong sense of justice. But in 1989, my mother was in a tragic car accident.

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:30.169
She got severe burns on her face, hands, and body.

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:40.169
Then my father, I'd seen my mom's condition, decided to leave us.

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:52.300
It was at that moment, I guess, that my world, my ideals, they crumbled.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:58.960
As a little kid, I always wanted one big happy family.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:04.960
Once we moved to New York for my treatment, I no longer had that big family bond anymore.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:15.069
While I was feeling back then, in New York was just sadness. Never really peace.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:36.420
Well here in California, we're used to fires. But when I got the call to evacuate that morning, I never knew by that evening,

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.420
the whole town of Paradise would be gone.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:05:01.379
Just before the fire, we had the needs of the congregation, where they instructed us of what to do in the case of a disaster.

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:10.379
I had the truck full of gas. I had my gold bag ready, and I had a map of where I was going.

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:20.579
I was ready. The brothers also in their instructions said to obey the traffic instructors.

00:05:20.579 --> 00:05:25.579
The instructor told us to turn right, and I didn't want to turn right.

00:05:25.579 --> 00:05:30.579
But they said, obey them, so I turned right.

00:05:30.579 --> 00:05:47.899
Though I thought it'd be really bad. The smoke got darker and darker, and finally it got black.

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:58.740
You couldn't see anything.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:05.740
My mom always told me I've always been a caregiver ever since I was a little girl.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:13.740
It was just part of who I was. I don't like to see people suffer. It's very difficult for me.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:24.370
I remember when I first started working as a nurse. I would always cry.

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:32.379
I cried. Literally, I cried every day that I had to go to work.

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:42.379
Not only was I overwhelmed being a new nurse, but also I was bowing my depression.

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:52.870
In 2017, I was the treasurer for a prestigious bank in Nicaragua, and I was the father of a one-year-old son.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:59.980
We were very happy, but then I lost my job.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:05.980
So I said, I have the experience, and Jehovah will help me find another job.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:10.980
Something similar, and I kept looking for jobs, but doors kept closing.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:21.980
I felt very tense. It made me feel very useless. I can't even provide for my family.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.980
It was something very difficult for me.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:37.500
These dear brothers and sisters face serious challenges.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:45.500
They may have had moments when they felt like job, when he said, I loathe my life.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:50.500
That is not an unusual human emotion.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:58.500
Sometimes things in life don't work out as we had hoped, and it can hurt us deeply.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:04.500
Does this mean that we are helpless victims of our circumstances?

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.500
Not at all.

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:20.500
Please pay close attention, and take note of why we can say that Margaret, Felix, Miguel, Nikki, and Antoinette are not helpless victims.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:25.500
To the contrary, they are conquerors.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:33.500
As you watch and listen, look for specific actions they took to maintain their peace.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:40.500
And please, give thoughtful attention to ways that you can imitate their faith.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:54.350
Growing up, I wondered, why does a supreme judge, God, allowing justice and suffering?

00:08:54.350 --> 00:09:02.629
And inside of me, I had this need to restore justice. It was such a burning desire within me.

00:09:02.629 --> 00:09:09.139
And with that in mind, I moved to Russia to stay with my sister.

00:09:09.139 --> 00:09:16.539
She started to study the Bible, and was overflowing with the truth.

00:09:16.539 --> 00:09:27.220
We talked for hours to lay into the night, so that's when my special relationship with Jehovah began.

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:31.220
That's when I got a taste of what it's like to have a caring father.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:35.220
It had been a while since I was able to feel that.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:40.919
My baptism day was very exciting.

00:09:40.919 --> 00:09:51.230
The spiritual family I inherited was very vast.

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:54.230
You can instantly feel the love.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:10:00.230
I got baptized, and it seemed like miracles happened one after the other.

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:09.590
We had a great life.

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:21.460
And then the persecution started with Brother Christensen, and then there was a ripple effect of arrests.

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:24.460
One after the other, then it was our turn.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:31.460
In June of 2018, a huge group of armed men came to us to our home.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:38.700
They represented the ideals of my childhood.

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:50.210
But now these people, this judicial system, became the source of injustice to me.

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:59.450
I was sitting in a cage, the same way my bugs used to be in a jar.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:06.110
I guess I felt like they did in your head.

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:11.110
At that moment, when you hear the verdict that you'll stay in prison,

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:14.110
it's like you've been knocked unconscious.

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:21.740
You've been hit in the head with something, and there's just a ringing sound in your ears.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:25.740
And so, I was taken away in handcuffs.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:29.740
Of course, I wasn't in the best mood.

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:40.029
But then, the doors of the elevator opened up, and in front of us,

00:11:40.029 --> 00:11:59.220
a lot of brothers and sisters clapping their hands as hard as they could,

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:04.220
and some were crying, but not crying because they felt sorry for me.

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:07.220
They cried because they loved us.

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:13.220
And because they were proud of us, that's what always happens.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:16.220
When you're just about to lose all your strength,

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:21.220
Jehovah does that something for you that gives you a second wind.

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:28.220
And so, the applause, the love, the tears, the shouts hanging there,

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:31.220
everything will be okay.

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:36.220
They gave me a second wind.

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:41.740
The renewed strength that could run the next part of the race.

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:45.740
One of the guards was so surprised that he said,

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:49.740
no, that's some support you've got.

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:51.740
Yeah.

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:54.740
Without friends, I would be very lonely.

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:58.740
I would constantly be focusing on my illness.

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:01.740
The day I met Marissa was at a convention.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:05.740
She's a really great friend, a spiritual friend.

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:08.740
When she takes me to my hospital appointments, we would eat out.

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:12.740
I think food is just the common language between everyone.

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:14.740
When you talk about food, you know, like,

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:16.740
yes, we have something to talk about.

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:20.740
I would be excited when she takes me to my hospital appointment.

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:22.740
She always makes me laugh.

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:26.740
She always helps me have a good time, no matter what.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:31.740
Again, friends really help encourage me.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.740
Proverbs 17 and 17 says,

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:37.740
a true friend shows love at all times

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:41.740
and is a brother who is born for times of distress.

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:46.090
And I have seen this come true in my life.

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:48.090
When I lost my job at the bank,

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:52.090
well, I felt very depressed, troubled, tense,

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:55.090
and I have a good friend that I can talk to.

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:57.090
And when I told him how I was feeling,

00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:00.090
he told me, look Miguel,

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:04.090
don't look for the same line of work.

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:08.090
Maybe what you need to do is make a change in your life.

00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:14.090
Why don't you find some simple work outside of an office for a time

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:17.090
that can help you to keep your eye simple

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:19.090
and allow you to provide for your family?

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:23.460
I watched my wife make bread for our family,

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:28.179
and one day I told her,

00:14:28.179 --> 00:14:31.179
I'm going to make that bread, but not for our family.

00:14:31.179 --> 00:14:33.179
I'm going to make it to sell.

00:14:33.179 --> 00:14:36.179
So she told me, no, are you crazy?

00:14:36.179 --> 00:14:39.179
It was a big change, right?

00:14:39.179 --> 00:14:42.179
From having a position at a bank

00:14:42.179 --> 00:14:46.179
and handling a lot of money to selling on the street.

00:14:46.179 --> 00:14:49.179
So I told her, look, I'm going to put this hat on,

00:14:49.179 --> 00:14:52.179
and I put like a chef's hat on.

00:14:52.179 --> 00:14:56.179
And I told her, I'll be back in less than an hour,

00:14:56.179 --> 00:14:59.179
whether I sell or not, and that's what happened.

00:14:59.179 --> 00:15:02.179
And to her surprise, I came back without any bread.

00:15:02.179 --> 00:15:05.179
So when I got ready to leave the second time to sell,

00:15:05.179 --> 00:15:09.179
she said, okay, go, but leave the hat here.

00:15:09.179 --> 00:15:32.740
I also started to iron clothes for people in their homes,

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:34.740
and it looked strange because normally where we live,

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:37.740
that type of work is done by a woman.

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:41.740
But for a man to go and iron clothes at someone's home,

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.740
you don't see that, but I didn't want to just sit back

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.740
with my arms crossed and see what would happen.

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:50.740
No, I had to put my hands to work

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:52.740
to earn a living for my family.

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:57.850
So I would preach one day, and the next day I would iron clothes.

00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:00.850
The next day I would preach, and the day after that I would go out

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:01.850
and sell bread.

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:03.850
So my mind was always occupied on doing something,

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:05.850
either for the kingdom or my family.

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:07.850
And that helped me a lot.

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:13.879
I was feeling so sad.

00:16:13.879 --> 00:16:15.879
I really needed Jehovah's help to figure out

00:16:15.879 --> 00:16:17.879
what was going on with me.

00:16:17.879 --> 00:16:22.879
And I remember the 2009 article

00:16:22.879 --> 00:16:25.879
about depression came out.

00:16:25.879 --> 00:16:29.879
And I realized, okay, Jehovah, you're telling me,

00:16:29.879 --> 00:16:31.879
this is what I have.

00:16:31.879 --> 00:16:33.879
So now that I realize I have this,

00:16:33.879 --> 00:16:36.879
I got to figure out how I can manage it.

00:16:36.879 --> 00:16:39.879
So I changed my eating habits.

00:16:39.879 --> 00:16:41.879
I started exercising a lot more.

00:16:41.879 --> 00:16:44.879
I realized that exercising and eating healthy

00:16:44.879 --> 00:16:47.879
really, really did help.

00:16:47.879 --> 00:16:51.879
Also, I made a journal,

00:16:51.879 --> 00:16:55.879
and I made different sections of the different aspects

00:16:55.879 --> 00:16:57.879
of my depression that I dealt with.

00:16:57.879 --> 00:17:01.879
Each section I would put scriptures,

00:17:01.879 --> 00:17:03.879
I would put articles,

00:17:03.879 --> 00:17:06.880
and the illustrations, the pictures.

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:11.880
They speak, they speak a lot without saying anything.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:15.880
Jehovah shares us.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.880
Jehovah cares.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:26.180
After some time in prison,

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:30.180
they transferred me to a different cell.

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:35.180
And it were inmates who followed the orders of the investigators.

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:39.180
They did everything they could to other inmates

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:43.180
to make life unbearable.

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:45.180
Why did they do this?

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:48.619
To break a person,

00:17:48.619 --> 00:17:51.619
so that they would start to collaborate with the investigators,

00:17:51.619 --> 00:17:53.619
confess to everything,

00:17:53.619 --> 00:18:01.009
and then be able to get transferred to another area.

00:18:01.009 --> 00:18:03.009
1373.

00:18:03.009 --> 00:18:05.009
Trust in Jehovah,

00:18:05.009 --> 00:18:07.009
and do what is good.

00:18:07.009 --> 00:18:08.009
I said,

00:18:08.009 --> 00:18:11.009
Jehovah, please help me to stay loyal to you.

00:18:11.009 --> 00:18:13.009
Please help me.

00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:15.009
My prayers were really simple.

00:18:15.009 --> 00:18:16.009
Actually, like two words,

00:18:16.009 --> 00:18:17.009
Jehovah help.

00:18:17.009 --> 00:18:18.009
Jehovah help.

00:18:18.009 --> 00:18:20.009
Jehovah help.

00:18:20.009 --> 00:18:22.009
Despite how they treated me,

00:18:22.009 --> 00:18:24.009
when I dealt with others,

00:18:24.009 --> 00:18:27.009
I tried to treat them with kindness.

00:18:27.009 --> 00:18:29.009
These people,

00:18:29.009 --> 00:18:34.009
they made life uncomfortable, unbearable.

00:18:34.009 --> 00:18:37.009
But when they were treated kindly,

00:18:37.009 --> 00:18:39.009
they started to soften.

00:18:39.009 --> 00:18:43.009
They began to treat me differently.

00:18:43.009 --> 00:18:47.009
When I was being transferred out of that cell,

00:18:47.009 --> 00:18:50.009
the inmate that ran the area,

00:18:50.009 --> 00:18:52.009
called me over to him and said,

00:18:52.009 --> 00:18:55.009
come sit beside me.

00:18:55.009 --> 00:18:58.009
And I sat down, then he said,

00:18:58.009 --> 00:19:01.009
if anybody in this prison touches you,

00:19:01.009 --> 00:19:05.009
tell them that I'll come looking for him.

00:19:05.009 --> 00:19:08.009
Then he said,

00:19:08.009 --> 00:19:10.009
get his things.

00:19:10.009 --> 00:19:13.009
He told the other prisoners,

00:19:13.009 --> 00:19:16.900
the cell doors opened,

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:20.900
and the guards saw a crowd of inmates,

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:25.900
graphing my things and putting them out into the hallway.

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.900
I left the cell without having to carry a thing.

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:32.900
The guard quietly closed the door.

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.900
And before the inmates returned to their cells,

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:36.900
they even said goodbye.

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.900
Hug me and said, hang in there.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.900
You're going to be okay.

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.900
They went into the cell and the guard closed the door and asked me,

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.900
boy, how long have you been in there?

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:50.900
I sit three weeks.

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:53.900
He said, well normally people leave this cell beaten up

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.900
and they're thrown out by the other inmates.

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.900
They have to carry their own things,

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.900
and that's if the other inmates haven't thrown their stuff out the door.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:04.900
He couldn't believe what had just happened.

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:06.900
That's Jehovah.

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:12.420
Exercising, changing my diet,

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.420
the publications,

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:15.420
journaling.

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:16.420
That was my lifeline.

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:20.420
That really actually helped me for a long time.

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:25.420
But it came to a point where it stopped working as effectively.

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:28.420
I remember getting ready dressed for the meeting.

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:30.420
And I was fine.

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:32.420
Getting dressed for the meeting,

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:34.420
about to walk off the door.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:35.420
But I couldn't.

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:38.420
There was this overwhelming fear that came over me.

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:41.420
An overwhelming sadness that came over me.

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:43.420
And I just lost it.

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:45.420
I just started crying.

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:48.420
I couldn't get myself together.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.420
It was bad.

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:51.420
It got really bad.

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:57.049
My depression got really bad.

00:20:57.049 --> 00:21:00.049
So it was very difficult for me to approach the brothers

00:21:00.049 --> 00:21:02.049
to ask them for help.

00:21:02.049 --> 00:21:06.049
But at that time, I knew that if I didn't,

00:21:06.049 --> 00:21:13.440
that something bad would happen.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.440
So I decided, you know what?

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.440
I'm going to ask for a shepherding call with my brothers,

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.440
because I never talked about my depression with the elders at all.

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.440
This was my first time speaking with them.

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:27.440
And there was one brother, one of the elders,

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.440
who also battled depression.

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.440
And he suggested,

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:38.799
have you thought about seeking medical help?

00:21:38.799 --> 00:21:41.799
Seeking professional help was something I never wanted to do.

00:21:41.799 --> 00:21:45.799
I thought that I didn't need to do it.

00:21:45.799 --> 00:21:52.799
But sometimes there comes a point where you need additional help.

00:21:52.799 --> 00:21:55.799
And what you're doing is not enough.

00:21:55.799 --> 00:21:59.799
In this world, they make you feel like it's a bad thing

00:21:59.799 --> 00:22:01.799
that depression is a dirty word,

00:22:01.799 --> 00:22:04.799
or seeking medical help is something that you don't do.

00:22:04.799 --> 00:22:09.799
But I realized also that seeking medical help

00:22:09.799 --> 00:22:13.799
was part of my being able to worship Jehovah effectively.

00:22:13.799 --> 00:22:15.799
That's me doing my part.

00:22:15.799 --> 00:22:17.799
Not everyone needs to take that step,

00:22:17.799 --> 00:22:19.799
but for me, this is what I need to do.

00:22:19.799 --> 00:22:21.799
And I'm glad I did it,

00:22:21.799 --> 00:22:32.039
because the fact that I've never felt this good in my life.

00:22:32.039 --> 00:22:36.539
About a year later, we were released.

00:22:36.539 --> 00:22:41.400
But my wife and I understood

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:44.400
that they could put me back in prison again.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:49.400
So we needed to use a time until then to the fall

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.400
in the best way possible.

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:56.130
So what did we do?

00:22:56.130 --> 00:23:00.130
Psalm 119, 165.

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:05.130
Abundant peace belongs to those who love your law.

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:08.130
We had family worship,

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:12.130
read the Bible, and prayed together.

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:17.130
That's how I spent my four months of freedom

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:26.500
then I was put into prison for three years.

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:34.410
When they told me about my cancer being gone,

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:36.410
I was really happy, I was ecstatic.

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:39.410
I was like, finally, I'm going to get to do normal things

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:42.410
that a kid, my age, should be able to do.

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:46.410
I don't need to be afraid or anxious anymore.

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:53.630
Unfortunately, I did relax again.

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:58.630
And basically right now, my private condition is,

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:00.630
there's nothing really more to do.

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:05.630
They're just waiting to let nature take its course, basically.

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:09.650
That's it.

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:16.880
Then Harmony was Ephesians chapter 4 verse 26.

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:19.880
I had to let myself process the news

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.880
and let myself be sad and angry.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:27.880
Let yourself feel those feelings.

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:30.880
Do not try to repress them,

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:34.880
but you can control your thoughts and your actions.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.880
Pretty much my whole life,

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.880
it hasn't revolved around my illness,

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.880
but I learned how to shift focus.

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.880
I just don't focus on myself all the time.

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:45.880
I focus on others.

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.880
They're trials that are different,

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:50.880
but just as hard.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:55.880
You read the stories on JW.org in the newsroom.

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.880
The Russian brothers and sisters,

00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.880
I pray for them constantly,

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:04.880
because they are going through a very tough time.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:10.640
There is definitely more happiness in giving them receiving.

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:14.640
And in our situation, this proved true.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:21.640
I would say this really helps to relieve your pain.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.640
If you focus on yourself,

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.640
your pain gets worse.

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.640
When you focus on others,

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.640
and on their problems,

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.640
your pain lessons diminishes.

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:56.230
Until then,

00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:58.230
I was so...

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:02.700
When I was told that we would talk with each other,

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:05.700
this was something very special for me.

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:07.700
Same for me too,

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:09.700
when the brothers told me as well,

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:12.700
about meeting you, I was really excited.

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:16.700
Thank you for your prayers on behalf of the brothers in Russia.

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:19.700
They are precious.

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:21.700
We can learn so much from you.

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:26.140
Thank you.

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:30.140
It's really nice that you can say that.

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:34.140
We've both been through very hard, many hardships.

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:38.140
I'm sure President was super hard.

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:40.140
You know, in prison,

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:43.380
as brothers had a saying,

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:45.380
if you ask,

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:47.380
how much worse can it get?

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:52.049
You won't have to wait long to find out.

00:26:52.049 --> 00:26:54.049
Or in other words,

00:26:54.049 --> 00:26:56.049
when you think, how much worse can it get

00:26:56.049 --> 00:26:59.049
for sure something worse is bound to happen?

00:26:59.049 --> 00:27:03.049
And when we received our sentence, we thought,

00:27:03.049 --> 00:27:05.049
well, that's it.

00:27:05.049 --> 00:27:14.730
That's the worst that could happen.

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:16.730
And then,

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:19.730
of course, it got worse.

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:24.009
Upon arrival at the prison,

00:27:24.009 --> 00:27:27.319
we were beaten up.

00:27:27.319 --> 00:27:39.779
And for hours, we were humiliated.

00:27:39.779 --> 00:27:44.349
We thought, how much worse can it get?

00:27:44.349 --> 00:27:46.349
Then the next day, we were told,

00:27:46.349 --> 00:27:48.349
you're going to the punishment so,

00:27:48.349 --> 00:27:51.349
we thought, well,

00:27:51.349 --> 00:27:54.349
how much worse can it get?

00:27:54.349 --> 00:27:57.349
At first, it started with one floor.

00:27:57.349 --> 00:27:59.349
Then it went to another floor.

00:27:59.349 --> 00:28:01.349
And then, the whole entire hospital,

00:28:01.349 --> 00:28:04.349
every floor, had COVID patients.

00:28:04.349 --> 00:28:08.660
That was some of the hardest nursing,

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:11.660
that I've ever done in my life.

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:14.660
And all my years of nursing.

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:18.660
And we lost a lot of good nurses,

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:20.660
that were right in the trenches with me,

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:22.660
that were in there doing their best.

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:25.660
We lost a lot of good people.

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:28.660
Even though I was on medication to help me,

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:31.660
it still didn't take the depression away.

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:33.660
You're like, what's the point?

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:35.660
I can't save anyone.

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:39.660
I can't help anyone.

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:41.660
It was devastating.

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:48.049
It truly, truly was devastating.

00:28:48.049 --> 00:28:51.049
Have you ever felt, as Felix did,

00:28:51.049 --> 00:28:56.049
when he asked, how much worse can it get?

00:28:56.049 --> 00:29:00.049
Nevertheless, a spiritual person can see

00:29:00.049 --> 00:29:04.049
each new challenge as an opportunity

00:29:04.049 --> 00:29:07.049
to rely on Jehovah.

00:29:07.049 --> 00:29:11.049
As we watch the concluding part of this video,

00:29:11.049 --> 00:29:15.049
please take note of how Jehovah strengthened

00:29:15.049 --> 00:29:17.049
these brothers and sisters,

00:29:17.049 --> 00:29:20.049
and deepened their friendship with him.

00:29:20.049 --> 00:29:23.049
Think about your own circumstances,

00:29:23.049 --> 00:29:28.049
and the ways that Jehovah has helped you through trials,

00:29:28.049 --> 00:29:34.049
and have full confidence that he will continue to do so.

00:29:34.049 --> 00:29:41.660
And then I decided that I was going to stop asking

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:44.660
how worse it could get.

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:47.660
I asked Jehovah for endurance.

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:52.660
Enjoy for that day, just for that day.

00:29:54.700 --> 00:30:00.700
And at those times, I just cry to Jehovah,

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:05.700
talk to Jehovah about how I'm feeling,

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:09.700
and just ask for his peace to help me to deal.

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:15.980
I've talked to Jehovah very intimately and personally,

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:20.980
but never like I have when I was so alone there.

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:27.440
I realized that I was going to die.

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:33.490
I asked Jehovah, if he saw enough good in me,

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:36.490
if he would just resurrect me,

00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:39.490
that I'd love to be in his new world,

00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:43.490
and see my husband again and my children.

00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:48.490
And I thanked him so much for the life that I had.

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:56.490
And I felt such a peace that I never felt before.

00:30:56.490 --> 00:31:06.029
And then I just knew was Jehovah getting me out.

00:31:06.029 --> 00:31:09.029
The obedience, just doing what we were told,

00:31:09.029 --> 00:31:12.029
it came from Jehovah, and it was so simple

00:31:12.029 --> 00:31:16.029
that gave him something to bless, and it may have saved my life.

00:31:16.029 --> 00:31:26.589
I just never wanted to be a burden on people,

00:31:26.589 --> 00:31:31.589
but the brothers and sisters have come from all over the country

00:31:31.589 --> 00:31:36.589
to work from this house, the other houses, all of them.

00:31:36.589 --> 00:31:44.289
They may be feel wanted, and they may be feel loved.

00:31:44.289 --> 00:31:52.269
To feel like Jehovah cared enough to give attention to you,

00:31:52.269 --> 00:31:59.269
I just felt so unworthy in hearing all these people,

00:31:59.269 --> 00:32:03.269
or here taking care of me, and you just look at them,

00:32:03.269 --> 00:32:07.269
and then you think, I'm part of this organization.

00:32:07.269 --> 00:32:09.269
I got to do better.

00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:18.420
I got to be like them and make other people happy.

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:21.420
When I'm able to help people who are bottling depression,

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:24.420
I feel like Jehovah is using me in that way.

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:28.420
And it makes me happy that I can be of use to Jehovah.

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:32.420
It's good to feel, it's so nice to feel good again,

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:35.420
to feel happy again, to be able to smile,

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:39.420
to be able to take enjoyment in the small things

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:45.420
in Jehovah's creation, and just be happy that I'm alive.

00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:50.630
So, yeah.

00:32:50.630 --> 00:33:01.269
Now I have a stable job.

00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:03.269
I work at a hardware store.

00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:06.619
Man, I feel that peace.

00:33:06.619 --> 00:33:09.619
The universities have made me stronger, and overall,

00:33:09.619 --> 00:33:12.619
I have a much closer relationship with Jehovah,

00:33:12.619 --> 00:33:15.619
but I'm still making bread.

00:33:15.619 --> 00:33:18.619
And at home, yeah, I'm the one who wires the clothes.

00:33:18.619 --> 00:33:28.160
After a while, I found out that I was being deported.

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:32.890
I remember getting off the train.

00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:34.890
They took me through the back door,

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:36.890
but my wife, Genia, was standing at the main entrance.

00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:39.890
She was on the phone, she couldn't see me.

00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:42.890
She was looking at the main entrance.

00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:48.890
And I threw my bag down, as I ran to her.

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:52.890
She could see from the corner of her eyes, someone was running.

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:55.890
She was a little confused, even scared.

00:33:55.890 --> 00:34:12.179
And there I was, hugging the person I loved the most.

00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:16.179
It was one of the most beautiful days of my life.

00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:39.010
When I heard that you were praying for us

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:43.010
and for the brothers and sisters in Russia,

00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:46.010
it really encouraged me and Felix.

00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:49.010
It's such an example for me personally.

00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:52.010
We mentioned it in our prayer yesterday.

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:55.010
Felix was saying that you are a great example

00:34:55.010 --> 00:35:01.010
of how we need to genuinely care for our brothers and sisters.

00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:05.289
We love you very much.

00:35:05.289 --> 00:35:18.989
Goodbye.

00:35:18.989 --> 00:35:20.989
Good night, Genia.

00:35:20.989 --> 00:35:22.989
Good night, guys.

00:35:22.989 --> 00:35:27.739
My cancer is uncurable,

00:35:27.739 --> 00:35:33.739
but I know the cure isn't the new system, so that's the cure.

00:35:33.739 --> 00:35:42.349
I like to imagine when that time happens, what will I be doing?

00:35:42.349 --> 00:35:45.349
Obviously, I'm going to be jumping for joy

00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:47.349
because I'm going to be rid of my cancer.

00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:51.349
I'm going to enjoy food that we never really got to enjoy.

00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:54.349
I'm going to have so many animals.

00:35:54.349 --> 00:35:56.349
I'm going to make a house.

00:35:56.349 --> 00:36:01.349
I'm going to learn how to make a house.

00:36:01.349 --> 00:36:12.849
Peace in this world is not the absence of illness, danger, persecution,

00:36:12.849 --> 00:36:15.849
or economic problems.

00:36:15.849 --> 00:36:21.849
Peace in this world is listening to Jehovah's guidance,

00:36:21.849 --> 00:36:26.510
praying to Jehovah constantly,

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:30.510
meditating on Jehovah's word, and his promises.

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:38.389
Peace in this world is also having good friends by our side

00:36:38.389 --> 00:36:47.630
or having a good sense of humor.

00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:53.630
What I've learned from all of this is peace isn't

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:56.630
from what's outside, from what's going on,

00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:58.630
or what you're experiencing.

00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:02.630
I've learned that peace is on the inside,

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:11.409
and that comes from Jehovah.

00:37:11.409 --> 00:37:19.409
These examples we've just seen are of ordinary people with feelings like ours.

00:37:19.409 --> 00:37:25.409
Yet they felt peace even when confronting serious trials.

00:37:25.409 --> 00:37:28.409
How did they do it?

00:37:28.409 --> 00:37:34.409
When Miguel lost his job, he kept his focus on serving Jehovah,

00:37:34.409 --> 00:37:40.409
and he was not too proud to do humble work to provide for his family.

00:37:40.409 --> 00:37:45.409
Margaret was prepared for a natural disaster,

00:37:45.409 --> 00:37:51.409
and throughout her ordeal she prayed to Jehovah.

00:37:51.409 --> 00:37:54.409
While struggling with depression,

00:37:54.409 --> 00:37:58.409
Nikki did research using her publications

00:37:58.409 --> 00:38:02.409
and asked for help from the elders.

00:38:02.409 --> 00:38:06.409
Even when facing brutal persecution,

00:38:06.409 --> 00:38:10.409
Felix showed kindness to his persecutors.

00:38:10.409 --> 00:38:16.409
He knew that the way he responded would reflect Christian qualities.

00:38:16.409 --> 00:38:21.409
And dear Antoinette, despite her diagnosis,

00:38:21.409 --> 00:38:27.409
focuses not on herself, but on helping others.

00:38:27.409 --> 00:38:33.409
As she said, the cure for her, as it is for all of us,

00:38:33.409 --> 00:38:40.750
is God's kingdom, if you are experiencing trials.

00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:44.750
Focus on what you can control.

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:46.750
Help others.

00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:53.750
Be grateful and rely on Jehovah and his organization.

00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:57.750
If you are not experiencing serious trials,

00:38:57.750 --> 00:39:04.750
do what you can to prepare for them by building yourself up spiritually.

00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:07.750
Do not be anxious.

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:14.750
Fear of what might happen is often worse than the trial itself.

00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:23.750
Trust in Jehovah and be assured that he will never abandon his friends.

00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:28.750
The dear brothers and sisters whom we've just listened to

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:31.750
are doing well spiritually.

00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:35.750
We thank them for participating in these interviews.

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:39.750
We'd also like to thank all our brothers and sisters

00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:46.750
working in the medical field who have gone the extra mile during this pandemic.

00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:49.750
James 5-11 reads,

00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:53.750
we consider happy those who have endured.

00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:56.750
You have heard of the endurance of Job

00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:59.750
and have seen the outcome Jehovah gave

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:05.750
that Jehovah is very tender in affection and merciful.

00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:10.750
The blessings we receive by enduring trials

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:13.750
can strengthen us for the future

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:19.750
and help us to become the kind of person that Jehovah wants us to be.

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:24.750
The inner peace and joy we experience

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:27.750
is a gift from Jehovah.

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:33.750
As these brothers and sisters from around the world have reminded us,

00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:38.750
we need never doubt that our wonderful Heavenly Father

00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:43.750
will bless all those who continue loving Him.
