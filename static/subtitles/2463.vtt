00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.509
Welcome to this special news update.

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:11.269
In September 2017, Hurricane's Irma and Maria devastated much of the Caribbean, and our

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.070
brothers were affected as well.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.829
How was the relief work progressing?

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:21.269
Well recently, Brother Mark Sanderson went with Brother Gary Bro, a helper to the service

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:27.030
committee, to visit some of the affected territories under the United States, France, and Barbados

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.030
branches.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:38.840
We're sure you will enjoy this video report.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.880
To me, Irma was a monster.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.039
At times, the whole place was shaking so much that I thought the whole house was going

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.560
to bust apart.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.640
It's hard to find the words to describe, but I think it's been a shock.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.759
And I felt like the whole house was going to fall on us.

00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:13.000
And I keep praying to Joe, I keep praying, I will keep praying and praying.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:22.319
Even though there was a lot of plundering on the island, the supermarkets, the big businesses

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:24.319
were ruined.

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:30.189
But we immediately saw Johova send us the help we needed.

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:40.329
The congregation, the branch, Barbados, friends, they immediately sent brothers here.

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:48.090
In our bedroom, someone's roof came from another house, landed in the back of our home,

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.329
and the two by four came straight through our bedroom roof.

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:59.290
And we went into that closet, five of us, and we prayed and we sang.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:13.020
I've never, uh, uh, uh, subplicated Johova so much in my life.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.900
The brother also took the initiative to come to our house under the rain and wind to

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.060
secure a tarp we have put in place so that it will not fly away.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:30.060
And then eventually, the big 40-foot container came in, and it was so wonderful.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.219
He received little letters in it, but the brothers selling them their prayers with us and

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:40.379
they sent nice little notes to encourage us with the food supplies, we started giving

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:46.060
that out to the brothers, and they were very happy Johova has performed.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.020
A rescue team was put into place.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:58.379
Very quickly, we had to analyze the situation, to come to grips with the task ahead of us.

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:03.860
One of the disaster reliefs committee's first objective is to urgently provide the spiritual

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.020
help to our brothers.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.460
The goal is to encourage and strengthen the brothers and sisters by visiting them at

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:16.770
their home and most importantly, listening to them.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:26.849
We had made up a group to provide medical, technical and emotional help.

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:32.770
Once the food supplies had arrived, an on-site team prepared the shipment so that the merchandise

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:40.539
could be sent by shipping crate that same weekend.

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:45.139
But for the moment, the objective is to repair, to shelter our brothers and sisters from

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:47.139
the rain.

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:52.099
The congregations really cooperated well because they were quick to react.

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:54.300
The friends are very generous.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.020
So a lot of food kits are arriving.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.340
First aid supplies as well.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.860
What's moved us the most is the courage that the brothers and sisters showed.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.139
They really appreciated that we came.

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:26.680
They felt the brunch was supporting them.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.519
Now when the tremendous hurricane affected this part of the world, Brother Bro of course

00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:37.240
came to the studio and he said that when he arrived here, the brothers and sisters were

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.319
out in the parking lot of the Kingdom Hall and that they had been waiting.

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:47.519
Not because they knew anyone was coming, but because they knew that if there was going

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:52.480
to be some help, it was going to come from the Kingdom Hall and it made me feel like

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.000
I want to go to Tortola.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.040
Now that all the work has been finished, it's all completed, is it your desire, brothers

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.519
and sisters, that we should dedicate this beautiful Kingdom Hall to the worship and

00:05:04.519 --> 00:05:15.279
to the praise of our wonderful, our magnificent God, Jehovah.

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:17.759
And it's a big talking of Tortola.

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:23.600
Everyone is surprised, they're happy to see it and they want their churches to be prepared

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.199
just like all of us, like all Kingdom Hall.

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:31.800
Jehovah does good things to us under a hurricane, a bad hurricane.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.199
That's how I look at Jehovah.

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:39.480
The type of God he is, he does good to people.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.519
The friends here tell us very often that they really feel the help and comfort from the

00:05:44.519 --> 00:05:46.800
brothers that are far.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.040
They have often said that they feel Jehovah's organization is showing a special interest

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.040
in them.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:58.000
Once as a hurricane, we can depend on ourselves, we have to depend on Jehovah at all times

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.240
because Jehovah is a protector and he's the one that's going to protect us and we have

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.839
to put forth faith and trust in him.

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:13.000
I felt a calm, a peaceful calm feeling that Jehovah is going to take care of.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Why are you worrying about?

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.720
Jehovah is going to take care of us and don't put your choice and mind on nothing,

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.560
grabbing everything, don't do that.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.160
Jehovah is there for us.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.920
So don't you worry.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:31.519
To see people from all different races, from all different ethnicities and nationalities

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:39.360
who speak different languages, all come together to work on a project just because of love.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.040
It's just something that is so deeply moving.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.439
There's nothing that compares to it in the world.

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:48.079
There's nothing that you could liken it to.

00:06:48.079 --> 00:06:51.600
When we see things like this, it's a miracle.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:57.079
It's actually a miracle that Jehovah is performing all around us.

00:06:57.079 --> 00:07:03.079
When Jesus said in John 13 verse 34, he said, I'm giving you a new commandment that you

00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:08.800
love one another just as I have loved you, that you also love one another.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:16.199
By this all will know that you are my disciples if you have love among yourselves.

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:21.639
People can talk all day about love and they can talk about service and charity and all

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:26.560
these different things, but when you come here and you see the love and action, you see

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:32.360
it in your unselfishness to come here and work so hard every day.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.480
This is what Jesus is talking about.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:43.139
All the world will know that you are my disciples.

00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:45.459
What an encouraging report.

00:07:45.459 --> 00:07:49.300
It is clear that Jehovah is blessing the relief efforts.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:54.620
Now this report highlighted the work taking place in just some of the areas affected by recent

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.660
hurricanes.

00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:02.420
In a previous broadcast, we mentioned that we could spend up to $25 million for disasters

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.420
this year.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:09.899
However, now that the damage has been fully evaluated and also factoring in other disasters

00:08:09.899 --> 00:08:15.500
that have occurred since that broadcast, we're currently estimating that our disaster relief

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:19.939
globally will cost about $60 million.

00:08:19.939 --> 00:08:27.060
So far, over 4,100 of our brothers and sisters from dozens of countries have assisted with

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:30.699
disaster relief in just the Caribbean.

00:08:30.699 --> 00:08:34.539
We want to thank all those involved with the relief work.

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:38.620
We appreciate your sacrifices and willing spirit.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:44.139
Majorhovah continue to enrichly bless all of you and your families who are working so

00:08:44.139 --> 00:08:48.820
hard to help our brothers and sisters recover.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:55.899
A report like this makes us proud of Jehovah's people who truly love one another just as Jesus

00:08:55.899 --> 00:08:59.340
said his true disciples would.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:05.899
The governing body is grateful for your constant support as shown by your generous contributions,

00:09:05.899 --> 00:09:10.259
your willing volunteer spirit, and your prayers.

00:09:10.259 --> 00:09:14.379
