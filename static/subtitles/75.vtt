00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:07.910
Welcome, brothers and sisters. Here are some highlights from this month's program.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.910
We'll discuss the many ways that prayer can help us resist temptations.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:20.910
For example, we'll see how prayer helped Nassiso leave behind practices that conflicted with Bible principles.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.910
Last year, millions were delighted to receive the revised New World Transition in Spanish.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.909
We'll go behind the scenes and see what it took to produce this translation of God's Word.

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:39.909
Among Jehovah's most endearing qualities is His willingness to forgive.

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:46.909
Our new music video reminds us that with Jehovah's help, we too can forgive others.

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:49.909
This is JW Broadcasting.

00:00:49.909 --> 00:01:17.060
This month we're going to discuss the theme pray continually so that you may not enter into temptation.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.060
Those words of Jesus are recorded at Matthew 26 verse 41.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.060
In this discussion, we'll answer three important questions.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.060
One, why did Jesus pray?

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.060
Two, what temptations did He face?

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.060
And three, what lessons can we learn from Jesus' example?

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:48.060
Let's start by reading that verse together. That's Matthew 26 and verse 41.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:55.060
Keep on the watch and pray continually so that you may not enter into temptation.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.060
The Spirit, of course, is eager or willing, but the flesh is weak.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.060
Why did Jesus pray?

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.060
Jesus uttered these words on the final night before His execution.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.060
No doubt this was the most difficult evening that Jesus had ever faced.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:22.060
The surrounding verses tell us that He began to feel grieved and to be greatly troubled.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:29.060
It's hard for us to comprehend fully the stress and pressure Jesus was facing on that night.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.060
He knew that Satan was about to throw everything He could at Him.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.060
Jesus also knew that He'd soon die an agonizing death.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.060
But something else was even harder for Him to handle.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:57.060
He realized that He was about to be falsely charged and convicted of the despicable crime of blasphemy against Jehovah's holy name.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.060
The study note on Matthew 26 verse 39 says,

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:14.060
Jesus no doubt felt great concern over the reproach that His death as one charge with blasphemy and sedition could bring on God,

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.060
moving Him to pray that this cup pass away from Him.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.060
In the face of all that pressure, would Jesus remain faithful until death?

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.060
The lives of countless people hung in the balance.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:36.060
Even more important, His Father's reputation was involved.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.060
Under all that intense emotional stress, what did Jesus do?

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.060
He prayed not just once, but three times.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:55.060
Notice how Luke describes what happened as recorded at Luke 22 and verse 44.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.060
But He was in such agony that He kept praying more earnestly,

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:07.060
and His sweat became as drops of blood falling to the ground.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.060
What's the lesson for us? Well, think about it.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.060
Jesus knew Satan well.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:22.060
Jesus had observed from heaven all the temptations that Satan uses in His efforts to ensnare God's servants.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:29.060
Yet Jesus did not feel that He could easily handle whatever the tempted might place before Him.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.060
So this is a clear lesson for us.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:41.060
If the perfect Son of God felt the need to pray for divine help and strength, how much more so should we?

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:50.060
How appropriate then is the admonition, pray continually, so that you may not enter into temptation.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.060
But what does it mean to enter into temptation?

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.060
The watchtower back in 1951 explained.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:11.060
We ourselves, under Satan's influence, create the temptation by thinking how nice it would be to do or have something contrary to God's will.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:19.060
And they're not dismissing the desire created by this improper thinking by considering it more and more.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:25.060
In this way, we are drawn out and led to ignore God's counsel and warning.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.370
We enter into temptation.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.370
Prayer helps us when we face temptation.

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:42.370
It helps us to focus on what Jehovah wants us to do and to ask Him for the strength not to enter into temptation.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.370
Our second question.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.370
What temptations did Jesus face while He were on earth?

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:57.370
We probably immediately think of the occasion shortly after Jesus' baptism when He was tempted three times by the devil.

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.370
Let's quickly summarize those three temptations.

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:09.370
First, Jesus was asked to turn stones into bread at a time when He was extremely hungry.

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:14.370
Basically, Satan appealed to Jesus' desire for food.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:22.370
However, Jesus immediately rejected the temptation to satisfy that desire in an inappropriate way.

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:29.370
Second, Satan challenged Jesus to throw himself off the temple battlement.

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.370
Jesus rejected this temptation as well.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:42.370
Why? Because He knew that such a spectacular display would amount to a prideful testing of Jehovah.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:51.370
Finally, Satan offered Jesus all the kingdoms of the world and their glory, but at what price?

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:57.370
Satan demanded that Jesus offer Him in return an act of worship.

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:05.370
What was Jesus' answer? He flatly refused saying, go away, Satan.

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.370
Have you had to face similar temptations?

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:20.370
Well, you might quickly answer, no one has asked me to turn stones into bread or to jump off a tall building and certainly no one has offered me the rulership of all the governments in the world.

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:24.370
But notice please, we said similar, not the same.

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:29.370
So have you faced similar temptations? No doubt you have.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:34.370
Most of us have faced temptations involving fleshly desires.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:45.370
It may have been temptations to commit immorality or temptations that appeal to greed or an unbalanced concern about material things.

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:54.370
Other temptations may have appeal to our pride or tested our humility or our desire to impress others.

00:07:54.370 --> 00:08:04.370
And who of us hasn't been tempted by opportunities offered to us by Satan's world for wealth, power or position?

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:16.370
No matter what temptation comes our way though, remember Jesus' words, pray continually so that you may not enter into temptation.

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:23.370
But were those the only temptations that Jesus faced? No. How do we know?

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:30.370
Well, notice Luke's words found at Luke chapter 4 and verse 13.

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:40.370
So the devil, having finished all the temptation, departed from him until another convenient time.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:51.370
Did Satan never come back again to tempt Jesus? He must have, because of what we're told at Hebrews chapter 4 and verse 15.

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:59.370
Let's read that. For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses.

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:07.370
But we have one who has been tested in all respects as we have. But without sin.

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:16.370
Have you ever wondered what are the convenient times Satan selected to test Jesus? Well, let's consider some possibilities.

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:24.370
One example occurred in 32 CE, about two and a half years after the initial temptations.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:30.370
Please turn to John chapter 6 and verse 15.

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:39.370
Then Jesus, knowing they were about to come and seize him to make him king, withdrew again to the mountain all alone.

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:49.370
This seems like a similar temptation to what Jesus had already faced. But this time the setting was different.

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:56.370
Satan didn't directly offer the kingship to Jesus. There was no demand for Jesus to worship the devil.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:10:05.370
Rather, those following Jesus wanted to make him their king. This temptation was going to be by popular demand.

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:16.370
How did Jesus react? Well, even before they could make their move, Jesus withdrew from them to a mountain just by himself.

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:25.370
And what did he do on the mountain? We find the answer in a detail added in the parallel account recorded by Matthew.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:32.870
Let's read it together. It's Matthew 14 and verse 23.

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:39.870
After sending the crowds away, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:46.870
Yes, Jesus went there, not just to avoid the crowds, but to pray.

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:52.870
The third question. What lesson can we learn from Jesus' example?

00:10:53.870 --> 00:11:14.870
Even though we may have passed the test or avoided entering into temptation in the past, we shouldn't be surprised if a similar temptation may arise again, but in a different form or situation, and at a convenient time, for whom? For Satan, not us.

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:23.870
Another occasion occurred when Jesus and His apostles were in the vicinity of Mount Hermann near Caesarea Philippine.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:34.870
Jesus' apostles had just acknowledged him as the Christ, the Son of the Living God. So Jesus took the opportunity to expand their thinking further.

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:40.870
Notice what's recorded in Matthew chapter 16 and verse 21.

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:58.870
From that time forward, Jesus began explaining to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things, from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day, be raised up.

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:06.870
What was the reaction of His apostles to this information? Let's read on in verse 22.

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:16.870
At this Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, Be kind to yourself, Lord, you will not have this happened to you at all.

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:27.870
Although these words were uttered by a close friend, Jesus immediately recognized that they reflected Satan's wishes, not Jehovah's.

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:39.870
So He firmly responded, Get behind me, Satan. You are a stumbling block to me, because you think not God's thoughts, but those of men.

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:49.870
Although this account doesn't specifically refer to Jesus praying at that time, we know that Jesus was a man of prayer.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:13:02.870
The apostle Paul tells us at Hebrews 5.7 that during his life on earth Christ offered up supplications and also petitions with strong outcries and tears.

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:08.870
So no doubt those prayers helped Jesus to focus on the reason why He came to earth.

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:17.870
That clear focus helped him to see that Peter's misguided counsel would only help to further the temptus cause.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:20.870
What does this teach us?

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:27.870
This shows us that temptations don't always come from those who are Jehovah's enemies.

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:36.870
Some who are close to us may even serve Satan's ends unintentionally, as was the case with Peter.

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:47.870
He could be an employer, a workmate, a schoolmate, a friend, a relative, a parent, a brother, or a marriagemate.

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:52.870
Let's examine another example of how Satan returned to Jesus.

00:13:52.870 --> 00:14:03.870
This time it was by means of the religious leaders. They attacked Jesus verbally, misquoting scripture, and hurling senseless accusations at Him.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:11.870
But Jesus understood what they were up to, and frankly told them, you are from your father the devil.

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:18.870
We shouldn't be surprised if apostates and other opposes use similar tactics today.

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:32.870
Just as Jesus was accused of blasphemy and political sedition, so two God's people have been labeled as extremists and have been the victims of all sorts of false accusations.

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:38.870
Like Jesus, we remember who really is behind all these attacks.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:41.870
Satan, the great tempter.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:47.870
What will help us to avoid the temptation of giving up because of discouragement?

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:53.870
How can we successfully handle all these types of attacks?

00:14:53.870 --> 00:15:02.220
Paul tells us what to do. We read at Ephesians 6 and verse 11,

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:12.220
put on the complete suit of armor from God so that you may be able to stand firm against the crafty acts of the devil.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:19.220
After speaking about the importance of putting on the spiritual suit of armor, Paul goes on to say at verse 18,

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:31.220
that this should be done together with every form of prayer and supplication, as we carry on prayer on every occasion in spirit.

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:35.220
So what have we learned from our discussion?

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:42.220
It seems that Satan didn't try again to tempt Jesus directly, but he was persistent.

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:45.220
He kept coming back in different guises.

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:54.220
He used others to give Jesus wrong advice, to oppose and ridicule him, as well as to try to make him a king.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:16:05.220
Perhaps we've rejected some serious temptations in the past, but remember, Satan doesn't give up on us just because he failed in the past.

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:18.220
At a time convenient to him, he may come back to tempt us with something completely different, or the same temptation dressed up in a different form.

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:23.220
So what's the key to not entering into temptation?

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:28.220
We need to remember and apply Jesus' admonition.

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:34.220
Pray continually so that you may not enter into temptation.

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:41.220
So far, we've discussed how we could enter into temptation to do something wrong.

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:47.220
However, we may also be tempted not to do something right.

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:54.220
For example, although we know that we should forgive another person for something to have done against this,

00:16:54.220 --> 00:17:05.220
perhaps we may enter into the temptation of avoiding that person and not forgiving them, even though there may be a basis for doing so.

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:09.220
What can help us in such a situation?

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:14.220
Again, the answer is, pray for Jehovah's help.

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:18.220
This is the theme of our music video for this month.

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:24.220
It involves a very painful situation between a mother and a daughter.

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:33.220
Let's see the role of prayer in starting to resolve what might seem to be an impossible problem.

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:44.220
But it's so heavy, it pulls me down.

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:48.619
Wish I could turn this around.

00:17:48.619 --> 00:18:07.460
I understand it's not easy if it's not as true.

00:18:07.460 --> 00:21:15.490
I'm sure this video touched our hearts.

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:18.490
What a difficult situation.

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:23.490
And of course, such situations are not resolved overnight.

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:27.490
Some wounds take a long time to heal.

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:33.490
But it's possible to start the process of healing by trying to forgive.

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:36.490
But we can't do it alone.

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:39.490
Remember what our song beautifully emphasized?

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:47.769
Keep praying. Jehovah, please help me. Help me forgive freely.

00:21:47.769 --> 00:21:53.769
In our next video, we'll see another example of how prayer helps us today.

00:21:53.769 --> 00:21:59.769
Nassisa Garcia worked hard to bring his life in harmony with Bible principles.

00:21:59.769 --> 00:22:01.769
But it wasn't easy.

00:22:01.769 --> 00:22:22.579
Notice how he dealt with temptations similar to those Jesus faced.

00:22:22.579 --> 00:22:32.029
I sweated blood to train myself in martial arts.

00:22:32.029 --> 00:22:37.029
So when I joined a big competition, I won the fight.

00:22:37.029 --> 00:22:40.029
My life changed.

00:22:40.029 --> 00:22:47.029
I became a bodyguard of a well-known politician and taught martial arts to some popular celebrities.

00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:56.019
My students, my boss, and his family, they all became part of my life.

00:22:56.019 --> 00:23:03.890
But I was still looking for something.

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:17.180
One day, some Jehovah's Witnesses came by and gave me a tract.

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:25.420
I was surprised and really happy to learn God's name.

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:29.420
I thought this could be what I've been looking for.

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:49.670
So I accepted a Bible study and I realized that I owed everything to God.

00:23:49.670 --> 00:24:03.420
When I attended my first meeting, I saw how humble and caring the witnesses were.

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:06.420
But my neighbors made fun of me.

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:17.529
I wanted to beat them because I knew I could.

00:24:17.529 --> 00:24:23.529
I was ashamed that I couldn't do anything to defend Jehovah's name.

00:24:23.529 --> 00:24:30.529
Then one morning, before going to the meeting, for the first time,

00:24:30.529 --> 00:24:35.529
I approached Jehovah in prayer, asking him to give me courage.

00:24:35.529 --> 00:24:40.700
I couldn't do it alone.

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:45.700
After that prayer, I felt that Jehovah really strengthened me.

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:55.019
And I humbly told the neighbors that I was going to the Kingdom Hall.

00:24:55.019 --> 00:25:01.019
Since then, I've always prayed to Jehovah when making decisions.

00:25:01.019 --> 00:25:04.019
I needed to leave martial arts.

00:25:04.019 --> 00:25:09.019
I had to quit my job as a bodyguard and stop carrying guns.

00:25:09.019 --> 00:25:23.970
Doing his will wasn't always easy.

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:33.470
But Jehovah gave me the courage to do so.

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:36.470
My boss asked me to visit him.

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:43.740
He offered me a new car and doubled my salary.

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:46.740
His offer was very tempting.

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:56.779
So I went to the washroom and intensely prayed again to Jehovah for courage.

00:25:56.779 --> 00:26:01.779
Jehovah, help me please, I said.

00:26:01.779 --> 00:26:04.779
I can't do this on my own.

00:26:10.099 --> 00:26:14.099
In the end, I chose Jehovah.

00:26:14.099 --> 00:26:20.099
Jehovah is more precious to me than anything this world could offer.

00:26:20.099 --> 00:26:23.099
I told him.

00:26:23.099 --> 00:26:27.099
Sorry, but I'm not accepting your offer.

00:26:27.099 --> 00:26:31.470
It felt like losing a family and death.

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:37.680
Eventually, I got baptized.

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:43.680
I realized that it didn't matter what people thought about me.

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:47.680
It's how Jehovah sees me that matters.

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:53.680
Now, I am very grateful to be with the brothers in serving Jehovah.

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:57.680
I am now serving as a regular pioneer.

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:05.200
And this is the life that I had been looking for.

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:13.990
How was Nassiso tempted?

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:17.990
When his neighbors made fun of him for going to the kingdom hall,

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:23.990
he thought about using these and going back to using martial arts.

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:27.990
Yes, ridiculed tested Nassiso's humility.

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:34.990
But through prayer, he was able to speak calmly and confidently with his neighbors.

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:39.990
Nassiso's boss tempted him with a new car and a raise.

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:42.990
What did Nassiso do?

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:49.990
He immediately went to a quiet place and prayed intensely.

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:54.990
Jehovah gave him the courage to make the right decision.

00:27:54.990 --> 00:28:00.990
When we face similar temptations, we can be confident that through prayer,

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:04.990
Jehovah will help us to do the right thing.

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:10.990
One way Jehovah responds to prayer is by directing us to the scriptures.

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:18.990
There we find wonderful examples of faithful servants who ever came all sorts of challenges.

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:31.339
In the following dramatization, let's see what we can learn from the Apostle Peter.

00:28:31.339 --> 00:28:49.769
After working on a scientific theory, I made up my mind to put in my application for a regular pioneer.

00:28:49.769 --> 00:29:01.480
However, things were going really well at work.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:10.079
Is this the right time to make a drastic change?

00:29:10.079 --> 00:29:20.539
A new foreign language group was being formed in our congregation.

00:29:20.539 --> 00:29:22.539
There's no way I'm joining.

00:29:22.539 --> 00:29:27.180
Do you know how difficult it is?

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:29.180
Maybe this isn't right for me.

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:32.180
The culture and language are so different.

00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:53.339
What do you think?

00:29:53.339 --> 00:29:56.339
With our youngest now in his own assignment.

00:29:56.339 --> 00:29:59.339
Maybe we could serve rather neat as greater.

00:29:59.339 --> 00:30:01.339
Like we did before the kids.

00:30:01.339 --> 00:30:21.140
We're not that energetic couple anymore.

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:40.579
Maybe it's too much.

00:30:40.579 --> 00:30:45.579
I showed my concerns about pioneering with someone who's been doing it for a long time.

00:30:45.579 --> 00:30:51.500
He reminded me of the Apostle Peter's example.

00:30:51.500 --> 00:31:08.950
He was a fisherman by trade, but Jesus knew he could be so much more.

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:20.849
Peter hadn't caught anything all night, but with Jesus next to him, things would be different.

00:31:32.529 --> 00:31:34.529
But Peter felt overwhelmed.

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:49.539
Simon, stop being afraid.

00:31:49.539 --> 00:32:03.869
From now on, you'll be catching men alive.

00:32:03.869 --> 00:32:13.500
The ministry would be his life's work.

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:18.500
The Apostle Peter faced a situation similar to mine in Syrian Antioch.

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:22.500
Initially, he associated freely with Gentile Christians.

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:29.119
But then, some from the congregation in Jerusalem visited.

00:32:29.119 --> 00:32:45.730
And his fear of their opinion closed his heart.

00:32:45.730 --> 00:33:10.660
Jehovah used the Apostle Paul to help Peter put aside his fear of men.

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:20.710
So I prayed to Jehovah to help me open my heart wide.

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:24.710
We turned to the wisdom of older ones.

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:31.230
And they reminded us of Peter's ministry.

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:36.230
He may have been our age when he moved to where the need was greater in Babylon.

00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:39.230
They must have had concerns like ours.

00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:41.230
Could they make the trip?

00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:45.630
Adept to a different place.

00:33:45.630 --> 00:34:07.420
But they trusted in Jehovah to help them succeed.

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:19.889
We can do the same.

00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:31.389
If we overcome our doubts.

00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:38.480
And open our hearts wide.

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:50.460
We can conquer fear.

00:34:50.460 --> 00:35:02.210
And receive Jehovah's blessing to the full.

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:04.210
Peter was like us.

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:06.210
He loved Jehovah.

00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:08.210
He loved his brothers.

00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:13.210
He also had doubts and fears that sometimes hold him back.

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:17.210
But Peter relied on Jehovah to conquer fear.

00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:20.550
We can do the same.

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:26.550
Our prayers are not limited to asking Jehovah for help with our concerns and our needs.

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:30.550
We can also ask Jehovah to help others.

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:39.650
We'll see that in action in our next video.

00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:44.650
I pray for my brothers and sisters every day.

00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:48.650
Because I know Jehovah is the hero of prayer.

00:35:48.650 --> 00:36:07.619
Ever since our baptism, we as a family were fully engaged in Christian activities.

00:36:07.619 --> 00:36:15.719
It was a busy yet fulfilling life.

00:36:15.719 --> 00:36:17.719
I really loved preaching.

00:36:17.719 --> 00:36:23.719
I enjoyed conducting Bible studies and talking to others about the truth.

00:36:23.719 --> 00:36:28.719
At one point, I was the only elder in the congregation.

00:36:28.719 --> 00:36:38.190
I tried to make shepherding calls on everyone, but I just did not have the time.

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:44.190
So I developed a habit of praying for them many times during the day.

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:48.190
I would mention them individually by name.

00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:54.190
I wanted Jehovah to protect his precious sheep from Satan's attacks.

00:36:54.190 --> 00:37:03.769
Some time later, my wife felt seriously ill.

00:37:03.769 --> 00:37:12.139
After being hospitalized for a while, I decided to take care of her at home.

00:37:12.139 --> 00:37:16.139
I needed to step down from pioneering.

00:37:16.139 --> 00:37:21.139
Kuniko served Jehovah faithfully until her death.

00:37:21.139 --> 00:37:27.670
After a while, I became sick as well.

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:44.699
One morning, I felt especially bad and couldn't move.

00:37:44.699 --> 00:37:51.699
Fortunately, I managed to survive somehow, but now I'm confined to a wheelchair.

00:37:51.699 --> 00:37:58.699
I can no longer walk in the ministry as I used to or handle congregation responsibilities.

00:37:58.699 --> 00:38:04.949
I need help to change clothes and take a shower.

00:38:04.949 --> 00:38:11.949
I get really depressed when I think of the times when I was able to move around freely.

00:38:11.949 --> 00:38:24.179
But Jehovah never forgets the love we've shown.

00:38:24.179 --> 00:38:32.179
He is pleased to see us doing our very best in whatever circumstances we are in.

00:38:32.179 --> 00:38:39.179
I am limited in what I can do, but I can still pray.

00:38:39.179 --> 00:38:46.179
In my prayers, I mention a name of those in my congregation and my personal friends.

00:38:46.179 --> 00:38:52.179
I make a list of their names so as not to forget anyone.

00:38:52.179 --> 00:39:00.179
Through JW.org, I read about the brothers in Russia being arrested and the situation in an erratria.

00:39:00.179 --> 00:39:05.179
So I make sure to include them in my prayers.

00:39:05.179 --> 00:39:12.179
The governing body and its helpers, those in full-time service, also need Jehovah's support.

00:39:12.179 --> 00:39:19.559
Jehovah is without a doubt the hero of prayer.

00:39:19.559 --> 00:39:26.559
When I was the only elder in the congregation, or when my wife was sick and bad,

00:39:26.559 --> 00:39:29.559
he listened to my prayers.

00:39:29.559 --> 00:39:37.969
So I am confident prayers that I offer will help my fellow friends.

00:39:37.969 --> 00:39:46.940
Now, I do what I can in service, such as witnessing to caregivers.

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:51.940
When I meet those who might have not seen for a long time and tell them,

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:53.940
I've been praying for you.

00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:56.940
They often tell me how it has really helped them.

00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:00.940
Some even shed tears out of gratitude.

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:05.699
I feel happy too.

00:40:05.699 --> 00:40:13.699
Although I'm getting physically weaker every day, my prayers are becoming more and more meaningful.

00:40:13.699 --> 00:40:31.150
I want to cherish this precious gift of prayer that Jehovah has given us as long as I live.

00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:35.150
Takashi could easily dwell on all the things he can't do.

00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:39.150
Instead, he focuses on his brothers and sisters.

00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:42.150
He prays for them every day.

00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:45.150
And they're not generic prayers.

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:48.150
He makes lists so that he doesn't miss anyone.

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:54.150
And he goes to JW.org to learn about our brothers in need.

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:56.150
Why does he make this effort?

00:40:56.150 --> 00:41:03.150
Takashi said, I know that Jehovah is the hero of prayer.

00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:11.429
Whether we're dealing with the effects of old age and illness or with persecution and unrest,

00:41:11.429 --> 00:41:16.429
we face a common enemy, Satan the Devil.

00:41:16.429 --> 00:41:20.429
How does Jehovah help us win this spiritual warfare?

00:41:20.429 --> 00:41:27.429
Brother Harold Cochran explains how in this Bethel morning worship.

00:41:27.429 --> 00:41:33.429
Our text highlights the fact that we are at war with Satan.

00:41:33.429 --> 00:41:44.429
War is defined as a state of hostility accompanied by actions to conquer or to destroy those viewed as the enemy.

00:41:44.429 --> 00:41:56.429
And the context of our text today, 1 Peter 5.8, talks about the type of enemy we have, a roaring lion seeking to devour someone.

00:41:56.429 --> 00:42:03.429
And that expression roaring denotes the howl of a beast and feast hunger and fierce hunger.

00:42:03.429 --> 00:42:06.429
So we have a real enemy.

00:42:06.429 --> 00:42:13.429
And that's why the words of Jesus are so meaningful for us when he gave the model prayer.

00:42:13.429 --> 00:42:24.429
He said that Matthew 6.13, do not bring us into temptation, but deliver, or the footnote, rescue us from the wicked one.

00:42:24.429 --> 00:42:34.429
Now, other Bible translations like the King James Version or the Revised Standard Version use an expression like deliver us from evil.

00:42:34.429 --> 00:42:40.429
Or the contemporary English version says, protect us from evil.

00:42:40.429 --> 00:42:44.429
But that doesn't convey the real fierceness of a real enemy.

00:42:44.429 --> 00:42:46.429
It's more generic.

00:42:46.429 --> 00:42:52.429
And so Jesus knew the devil was real and he is a real enemy.

00:42:53.429 --> 00:42:58.429
And the devil has no remorse, he's fierce, he has no pity.

00:42:58.429 --> 00:43:05.429
He will take a person and with his traps and lures get him to do something bad in Jehovah's eyes.

00:43:05.429 --> 00:43:16.429
And then the person is overcome with guilt and then like a fierce enemy, the devil comes along and stomps on him and makes him feel worse because he caved in and sinned.

00:43:16.429 --> 00:43:21.429
So how do we deal with such a powerful enemy?

00:43:21.429 --> 00:43:24.429
Well, in war, there are soldiers.

00:43:24.429 --> 00:43:30.429
So let's use an expression that the Apostle Paul used to describe our situation.

00:43:30.429 --> 00:43:36.429
Let's open our Bibles, please, to the book of 2nd Timothy, 2nd Timothy chapter 2.

00:43:36.429 --> 00:43:43.429
And we're going to read verses 3 and 4 and talk for a few moments about our being soldiers.

00:43:43.429 --> 00:43:45.429
2nd Timothy, 2, 3.

00:43:45.429 --> 00:43:51.429
As I find soldier of Christ Jesus, take your part in suffering adversity.

00:43:51.429 --> 00:44:02.429
No man serving as a soldier involves himself in the commercial businesses of life in order to gain the approval of the one who enrolled him as a soldier.

00:44:02.429 --> 00:44:09.429
We become soldiers of Christ when we accept Jehovah's arrangements for salvation through Christ Jesus.

00:44:09.429 --> 00:44:16.429
And we dedicate our lives to Him unreservedly for our entire life.

00:44:16.429 --> 00:44:18.429
We become a soldier.

00:44:18.429 --> 00:44:23.429
And like a soldier, we know that it's not going to be easy.

00:44:23.429 --> 00:44:26.429
There are going to be hardships and trials.

00:44:26.429 --> 00:44:34.429
And yet a fine soldier, his main objective is to stay loyal to his commanding officers and to those who are giving instructions.

00:44:34.429 --> 00:44:37.429
And likewise, we know it's not going to be easy.

00:44:37.429 --> 00:44:42.429
It's not easy, but we have chosen to become a soldier of Christ.

00:44:42.429 --> 00:44:49.429
Now, a soldier like this loyal one being described as far different from a mercenary.

00:44:49.429 --> 00:44:56.429
A mercenary is one who hires himself out to fight, but he may not have any devotion really to the cause.

00:44:56.429 --> 00:45:02.429
He's a hired man, and he's doing it for the reward only or for something else that he may gain.

00:45:03.429 --> 00:45:05.429
But we're not mercenaries.

00:45:05.429 --> 00:45:16.429
We're those with godly devotion, holy devoted to Jehovah and loyal to Christ so that we can be fine soldiers loyal and true.

00:45:16.429 --> 00:45:26.429
Now, another aspect of soldiers are that they are identified by their distinctive uniforms or their particular fighting equipment.

00:45:26.429 --> 00:45:32.429
And that's why it helps to identify who's the friend and who's the foe in the middle of the battle.

00:45:32.429 --> 00:45:37.429
Their appearance makes that possible.

00:45:37.429 --> 00:45:46.429
Well, today there is a clear difference, isn't there, between the soldiers of Satan and the soldiers of Christ.

00:45:46.429 --> 00:45:55.429
There's great enmity, but there's a sharp contrast in appearance, in attitude, in disposition, in motivation,

00:45:55.429 --> 00:46:08.429
in conduct. And that's why when we think about that, we think about the contrast between the works of the flesh described in Galatians chapter 5 and those who have the fruit of God's spirit.

00:46:08.429 --> 00:46:15.429
There is such a strong distinction between one serving God and one not serving Him.

00:46:15.429 --> 00:46:21.429
And that's why, too, we think about the type of armor we bear.

00:46:22.429 --> 00:46:28.429
Ephesians chapter 6 says, put on the complete suit of armor from God.

00:46:28.429 --> 00:46:39.429
So our very armor is from God. We do not use the tactics and the methods of the devil, but we are clearly identified as a soldier of Christ.

00:46:39.429 --> 00:46:45.429
And there can be no great area here. We're either on one side or the other, correct?

00:46:45.429 --> 00:46:58.429
For example, suppose that you're a soldier and you're on guard duty, and it's evening, and you see someone approaching, and you cry out, halt, who goes there, friend or foe?

00:46:58.429 --> 00:47:07.599
And you hear back, I'm both. There's an enemy. You can't be on both sides.

00:47:07.599 --> 00:47:11.599
Now what is another aspect of being a good soldier in this fight?

00:47:11.599 --> 00:47:27.599
Well, let's open our Bibles to Philippians chapter 1, Philippians chapter 1, and we get to the concept of unity and working closely together in peace, because an army needs to be unified.

00:47:28.599 --> 00:47:55.170
Philippians chapter 1 verse 27 says, only behave in a manner worthy of the good news about the Christ, so that whether I come and see you or I am absent, I may hear about you and learn that you're standing firm in one spirit with one soul, and the footnote are with one accord, striving side by side for the faith of the good news.

00:47:55.170 --> 00:48:07.170
And in no way, being frightened by your opponents, this very thing is a proof of destruction for them, but a salvation for you, and this is from God.

00:48:07.170 --> 00:48:24.170
Well, we have this matter of unity, don't we? Shoulder to shoulder side by side, and yet one of the tactics of the devil is to get us divided and disjointed and fighting among ourselves.

00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:31.170
To turn the enemy on itself is a very effective war strategy. Even Jehovah used that, remember against his enemies.

00:48:31.170 --> 00:48:42.170
In 2 Chronicles chapter 20 verses 20 through 23, there was the attack of Ammon, Moab, in the mountainous region of Seer, against Judah.

00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:50.170
And what did Jehovah do? He confused them, they struck down each other, they to help destroy one another.

00:48:50.170 --> 00:49:05.170
And the devil, in a very sinister way, uses that same approach. How? Well, if we can get us to not get along with each other and turn on one another, then that's a very effective tactic.

00:49:05.170 --> 00:49:19.170
In fact, we remember the expression in Ephesians chapter 4 verses 26 and 27 about getting along, be wrathful, but do not sin, do not let the sun set while you're still angry,

00:49:19.170 --> 00:49:28.170
do not give the devil an opportunity. So when he sees discord and disunity, he can really amplify that.

00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:40.170
So we have to remember who are our real enemies. Now, our brothers may disappoint us, they may frustrate us, they may hurt us at times, do their imperfections, but they're not the enemy.

00:49:40.170 --> 00:49:52.170
The devil in his ports, those are the enemies, so we don't get to fighting with the wrong person. We keep in mind our brothers are with us.

00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:59.170
And in this connection, we just read in that scripture in Philippians that talked about not being afraid.

00:49:59.170 --> 00:50:06.170
And do you remember something about being afraid when it related to a soldier in Israel's army?

00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:14.170
Deuteronomy chapter 20 verse 8 says, the officers should also ask the people who is fearful and faint-hearted.

00:50:14.170 --> 00:50:21.170
He should return to his house so that he may not cause his brothers to lose heart as he has.

00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:30.170
Well, we do have an effect on each other. Can you imagine being in Joshua's army, getting ready to battle, into your left as a soldier?

00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:35.170
And as you've got ready to leave for battle, he says to you, we're going to die.

00:50:35.170 --> 00:50:40.170
We're not going to come back, say goodbye to your family, this is it.

00:50:40.170 --> 00:50:47.170
Or he may say, I'm not sure Joshua has Jehovah's backing like Moses did. All of that would be terrible.

00:50:47.170 --> 00:50:53.170
And so anyone in that category was to go home because they do have an effect on others.

00:50:53.170 --> 00:50:58.170
How grateful though we are that we have positive courageous brothers who trust in Jehovah.

00:50:58.170 --> 00:51:05.170
Examples in the Bible, but also modern day examples just like our brothers in Russia.

00:51:05.170 --> 00:51:11.170
Well, as soldiers in this battle, we're not ignorant of Satan's designs.

00:51:11.170 --> 00:51:16.170
And yet, he studies us very carefully and he knows our weaknesses.

00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:23.170
So, September 1st, 1988, watchtower had an article stand firm against Satan's machinations.

00:51:23.170 --> 00:51:29.170
And in that it said, the devil knows what our weaknesses are, but do we?

00:51:29.170 --> 00:51:35.170
If we don't identify them and then correct them, we will be defenseless at times.

00:51:35.170 --> 00:51:44.170
But it takes honesty and humility and an earnest desire to address that which is bad. Otherwise, we become a victim.

00:51:44.170 --> 00:51:50.170
So we need to ask, what are my weaknesses? Do I identify them? Do I work with them?

00:51:50.170 --> 00:51:54.170
And yet would Jehovah's help? We can come off victorious in this battle.

00:51:54.170 --> 00:52:01.170
1 Peter 510 says that Jehovah will finish our training, he will make us firm, he will make us strong.

00:52:01.170 --> 00:52:04.170
So would Jehovah's help? We can succeed.

00:52:04.170 --> 00:52:12.170
So maybe all continue as fine soldiers of Christ trusting in Jehovah and when the battle against the enemy, the devil.

00:52:13.170 --> 00:52:24.380
As Brother Corcoran mentioned, Satan has no pity. He'll try everything to lure us to sin against Jehovah.

00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:29.380
Last year, the revised New World Transition in Spanish was released.

00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:34.380
This was exciting news for millions of our brothers and sisters.

00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:42.380
Since Spanish is the most widely spoken language among Jehovah's Witnesses, this took special effort.

00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:45.380
Enjoy the following report.

00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:58.579
Soon after the governing body released a revised English edition of the New World Translation, they decided to revise a Spanish edition.

00:52:58.579 --> 00:53:05.579
They wanted it to be a modern, understandable translation for the entire Spanish-speaking world.

00:53:05.579 --> 00:53:16.579
Spanish is a mother tongue of around 480 million people and it is also the most widely spoken language among Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:53:16.579 --> 00:53:25.579
This translation project would be a unique challenge. It eventually took four and a half years to complete. Why did it take so long?

00:53:25.579 --> 00:53:34.579
Apart from the translation process itself, the work was complicated by the wide, graphic range of these Hispanic countries

00:53:34.579 --> 00:53:44.579
under different cultures. These diversity meant that in different countries, the same Spanish word could mean different things.

00:53:44.579 --> 00:53:51.579
In other cases, the word may be unknown in certain areas or even sound objectionable to some.

00:53:51.579 --> 00:54:02.579
To overcome these difficulties, the translators used 100 outside readers for many different countries to review the translated text progressively.

00:54:02.579 --> 00:54:16.579
These readers were of different ages, cultures and backgrounds. These outside readers regularly received chapters of the Bible electronically and then they introduced their suggested revisions.

00:54:16.579 --> 00:54:25.579
The translation teams took note of all their recommendations and in some cases they also sent them specific inquiries.

00:54:25.579 --> 00:54:34.579
Every verse was checked by 130 different people. Naturally, all of this took time.

00:54:34.579 --> 00:54:41.579
The work was finished in the spring of 2019, but then another challenger rose.

00:54:41.579 --> 00:54:47.579
We needed to print millions of Bibles to satisfy the demand of the Spanish-speaking field.

00:54:47.579 --> 00:54:52.579
This was a huge job for our printing presses in the United States and Japan.

00:54:52.579 --> 00:55:01.579
Despite working night and day, the task would take a long time and naturally everyone wanted to have the Bible right away.

00:55:01.579 --> 00:55:07.579
So right at the Madrid International Convention, the Governing Body decided to release the Bible in digital format.

00:55:07.579 --> 00:55:11.579
This was several months before all the Bibles could be printed.

00:55:11.579 --> 00:55:17.579
The highlight of the Friday morning convention program was when Brother Loas presented the new revised Bible.

00:55:17.579 --> 00:55:24.579
But there was another surprise. Since I take a mention, most brothers and sisters had their phones and tablets with them.

00:55:24.579 --> 00:55:28.579
They were able to immediately download the revised Bible.

00:55:28.579 --> 00:55:30.579
How is that possible?

00:55:30.579 --> 00:55:40.579
500 portable Wi-Fi devices were distributed among each of the 11 convention venues in Spain that were tied in with the Madrid Stadium.

00:55:41.579 --> 00:55:50.579
During the lunch break on Friday, practically everyone in attendance could download the revised Spanish edition of the New World Translation.

00:55:50.579 --> 00:55:56.579
More than 1,200 volunteers were trained to give technical support to those who needed it.

00:55:56.579 --> 00:56:03.579
In this way, the brothers started to use the revised translation right away during the afternoon program.

00:56:04.579 --> 00:56:12.579
We laughed and cried with joy. We knew it was a gift from Jehovah, which he was given as at that moment.

00:56:12.579 --> 00:56:17.579
And also, we felt so happy because we'd been waiting a long time for it.

00:56:17.579 --> 00:56:22.579
What I most like about this revision is that it's very easy to understand.

00:56:22.579 --> 00:56:28.579
Sometimes I think, but was this what we had before? It seems that it reaches my heart much quicker.

00:56:29.579 --> 00:56:38.579
As you use it, you realize that many scriptures have been adjusted, and that the faithful slave has worked very hard to make it easier to understand.

00:56:38.579 --> 00:56:49.090
Without a doubt, this revised edition of the New World Translation is a wonderful gift for all our Spanish-speaking brothers.

00:56:49.090 --> 00:56:58.090
The Word of God has power, and this will be a powerful tool to help many people get to know Jehovah.

00:57:02.289 --> 00:57:09.289
This month's theme was, pray continually so that you may not enter into temptation.

00:57:09.289 --> 00:57:19.289
By trusting in prayer, Nassiso made major changes in his life, and resisted temptations that tested his humility.

00:57:19.289 --> 00:57:28.289
The Apostle Peter's example showed us how to overcome fear, so that we can show more love for Jehovah and our brothers.

00:57:28.289 --> 00:57:37.289
Rather than dwell on his limitations, Takashi finds joy in praying for his brothers and sisters every day.

00:57:37.289 --> 00:57:50.289
And the song, forgive freely, reminds us that we can imitate Jehovah's quality of forgiveness to heal the pain of being hurt by someone we love.

00:57:51.289 --> 00:57:59.289
Before we conclude, let's visit our brothers and sisters in the Tierra del Fuego Province of Argentina.

00:57:59.289 --> 00:58:07.289
Tierra del Fuego is a group of islands off the southernmost tip of the South American mainland.

00:58:07.289 --> 00:58:16.289
The main island rises to mountain glaciers and peaks of nearly 8,000 feet or 2,400 meters.

00:58:16.289 --> 00:58:26.289
Here, daylight varies greatly throughout the year, from about 17 hours during summer to some 7 hours during winter.

00:58:26.289 --> 00:58:34.289
But no matter how much sunlight there is, there can be wind, ice and snow every season of the year.

00:58:34.289 --> 00:58:40.289
Three congregations are in the city of Usuaia on the main island.

00:58:40.289 --> 00:58:50.289
To attend assemblies, the brothers have to cross a mountain range, a trip of about 125 miles or 200 kilometers.

00:58:50.289 --> 00:58:54.289
Sometimes snow and ice make the roads impossible.

00:58:54.289 --> 00:58:59.289
Our brothers are out in the ministry no matter what the weather has in store.

00:58:59.289 --> 00:59:07.289
In the winter, the sun doesn't rise high enough to be seen above the mountains in some parts of Usuaia.

00:59:07.289 --> 00:59:15.289
When days are short, the brothers adapt and start preaching later to make the best use of sunlight.

00:59:15.289 --> 00:59:26.289
The brothers have organized the campaign to preach in rural communities and on remote islands such as Navarino Island across the Beagle channel.

00:59:26.289 --> 00:59:35.289
Recently, some made a special effort to learn English so that a good witness can be given to the many tourists who visit.

00:59:35.289 --> 00:59:43.289
There are over 300 publishers and some 47 regular pioneers in Usuaia's three congregations.

00:59:43.289 --> 00:59:47.289
They're conducting 286 Bible studies.

00:59:47.289 --> 00:59:55.289
Our brothers and sisters in Usuaia, Tierra del Puego, send their warm love and greetings.

00:59:55.289 --> 01:00:03.289
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.

01:00:03.289 --> 01:00:13.289
Our brothers and sisters in Usuaia, Tierra del Puego, send their warm love and greetings.
