00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.459
Our scripture texts and article highlight the important

00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:10.259
several of submission and why we should submit to Jehovah.

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:13.460
Of course, we find it a pleasure to submit to Jehovah

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.960
because we love him.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.859
That's why we submit to Jehovah.

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:22.059
But there is that occasion when submitting to Jehovah is difficult.

00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:22.960
It's hard.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.059
Perhaps we have to take a firm stand in front of a posers.

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:28.559
We have to stand up for Jehovah.

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:30.559
That means we stick out

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.660
from the world.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.359
That's hard.

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:36.359
What perhaps we have to change something in our personal life

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:40.960
to bring our lives more harmony with Jehovah's will and standards.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.060
That's hard.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.359
What perhaps we want to give whole-hearted support

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:47.560
to an organizational adjustment or arrangement

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.759
that we don't fully understand?

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:51.759
That may be hard.

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:54.759
So what can help us?

00:00:54.759 --> 00:01:00.960
Confidence that God is with His people.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.260
When we know that God is with His people with us,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.959
then we know He will bless us each time

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:12.359
we're going to make any adjustment in our life

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:14.659
or submit to Jehovah's way of doing things

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.859
we're going to get a blessing.

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:19.459
Can we have such confidence?

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:20.959
Absolutely.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.659
In fact, we can say that Jehovah gives us signs

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.859
or solid evidence that He is with us.

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:35.159
For example, let's open our Bibles to Isaiah chapter 7.

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.359
Let's go back in time

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:42.859
and review this historical account in Isaiah chapter 7.

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:46.260
The background is in verse 1 and 2

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:49.159
during the days of King Ahaz.

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.560
Let's see what we can learn.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.060
Now in the days of Ahaz, the son of Joseph,

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.159
the son of Uzziah, the king of Judah,

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.760
king Risen of Syria,

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.959
and Pika, the son of Remalaya, the king of Israel,

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:06.260
came to wage war against Jerusalem

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.360
but He could not capture it.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.460
A report was made to the House of David.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.860
Syria has joined forces with Ephraim

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.960
and the heart of Ahaz

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.860
and the heart of his people

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.460
began to tremble like the trees of the forest

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.360
shaking in the wind.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.460
Well, it's true the situation was terrifying.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.759
Both the king of Israel and the king of Syria,

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:34.659
they joined forces, they declared war on Judah.

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:35.460
Why?

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.259
They wanted to dethrone Ahaz

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:40.460
as the king and replace him with another man,

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.659
perhaps one that was not in the line of David.

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:46.960
So what a triumph that would be for Satan

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.159
if he could install

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:53.259
his own diabolical dynasty on the throne in Jerusalem.

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:56.159
Would Jehovah allow that?

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:57.360
What did Ahaz do?

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.860
What affected it have on him?

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.860
Did he show faith and confidence in Jehovah?

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.159
He began to tremble in fear.

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:06.159
Verse two says,

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:08.659
tremble in fear like the trees of the forest

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:09.860
shaking in the wind.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.360
No faith at all.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.659
So what does Jehovah do?

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.460
Well, verse 11.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.259
Jehovah continued speaking to Ahaz.

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:23.659
Ask for a sign from Jehovah.

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:26.259
Make it as deep as the grave or as high as the sky.

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:28.460
Ahaz just ask for a sign.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.669
I want to help you.

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:32.870
And what does Ahaz say?

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.569
No, I'm not going to ask for a sign.

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:36.569
So Jehovah says,

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:37.569
what?

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.870
You're not going to ask for a sign?

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.469
Well, I'm going to give you a sign.

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:45.469
And that's in verse 14.

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:47.169
Therefore,

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:50.069
Jehovah himself will give you a sign.

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.069
Look,

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.370
the young woman will become pregnant

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.469
and will give birth

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:57.669
to a son.

00:03:57.669 --> 00:03:59.469
And she will name him

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:02.069
Emmanuel.

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.870
Jehovah assures Ahaz

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.469
that he will protect the line of David.

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:11.969
Not just with words, notice, but with a sign.

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:13.469
You're going to have this son.

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:16.870
You're going to see a boy named Emmanuel.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.769
And that name is not just random.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.069
The name means something.

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:23.769
The name means with us is God.

00:04:23.769 --> 00:04:25.769
Ahaz with us is God.

00:04:25.769 --> 00:04:27.670
I'm not going to allow the covenant

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.370
that I made with David to be broken.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.170
Ahaz, I don't tell lies.

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.269
Jehovah says I don't tell lies to David.

00:04:35.269 --> 00:04:38.769
Psalm 89 verse 35.

00:04:38.769 --> 00:04:40.470
Assign.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.069
What happens?

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:43.269
Verse 16.

00:04:43.269 --> 00:04:47.569
Jehovah goes more gets more specific.

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:50.069
And before the boy knows how to reject the bad

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:51.569
and choose the good,

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:54.370
the land of the two kings whom you dread

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.170
will be completely abandoned.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:58.069
So notice,

00:04:58.069 --> 00:04:59.870
that's exactly what happened.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.269
The birth of Emmanuel held true.

00:05:02.269 --> 00:05:04.269
And before the boy was old enough to know

00:05:04.269 --> 00:05:05.569
between good and bad,

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:06.670
those two kings,

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.970
Pika and reason they were killed.

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.970
They were out of the picture.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:11.970
Why?

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.670
Because God is with his people.

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.720
That's the lesson in Emmanuel.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.220
Jehovah goes further.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.720
Chapter 8 and verse 10.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.019
And what a warning this is for all of us,

00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:30.220
all of those who want to try to oppose Jehovah's way

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.019
of doing things.

00:05:31.019 --> 00:05:33.220
Notice chapter 8 and verse 10.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.519
There's no conspiracy that can win or somehow

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:40.319
interrupt Jehovah's purpose.

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:42.519
Verse 10.

00:05:42.519 --> 00:05:44.819
Devise a plan.

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:47.519
And it will be thwarted.

00:05:47.519 --> 00:05:49.319
Say what you like,

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:51.420
but it will not succeed.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.920
For God is with us.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.519
A warning to all those who oppose Jehovah.

00:05:58.519 --> 00:05:59.720
In the days of Hezekiah,

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.319
you had the Assyrians 185,000 Assyrians find camp

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:05.019
out near Jerusalem.

00:06:05.019 --> 00:06:05.819
You're going to die.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.620
185,000 died.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:08.620
Why?

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.620
Because clearly God is with his people

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.620
and the royal line of David.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.560
No conspiracy will succeed.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.259
So what does this mean for you and me?

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:21.259
What does this mean for us?

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:22.759
Does it have meaning?

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:26.060
Can we have confidence that God is with us today?

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:32.259
Now let's open our Bibles to Matthew chapter 1 and verse 23.

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:33.959
Matthew 1, verse 23.

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:36.060
Here we have now the angel speaking to Joseph

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.259
about the birth of Jesus,

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:41.160
but notice what he says in verse 23.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.160
Look, the Virgin will become pregnant

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.060
and will give birth to a son

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.259
and they will name him in manual.

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:49.360
There it is again,

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.360
which means when translated with us is God.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.160
Do we see the connection?

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.259
The name and manual comes again.

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:01.060
This time representing Christ Jesus,

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:05.860
his role, his leadership, his rulership.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.459
The title given to Jesus,

00:07:07.459 --> 00:07:09.459
do we see the connection?

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:13.459
The prophecy about a manual is completely fulfilled in Jesus.

00:07:13.459 --> 00:07:15.459
He rules as our Heavenly King.

00:07:15.459 --> 00:07:18.560
And due to the blessing and the protection of his rulership,

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.160
we have every reason to declare with confidence today

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.660
with us is God.

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.860
Do you see the signs?

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.660
Do you see the evidence that Jehovah is giving us

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.860
to prove he is with us?

00:07:33.959 --> 00:07:40.360
Do you see Jesus living up to that wonderful name in manual?

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.560
For example,

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.560
several weeks ago,

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.360
we had a report from the writing committee.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.860
And despite the obstacles for the past year,

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:51.560
do you recall that report?

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.360
The work in the writing department,

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.160
art department,

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.959
MEPS text processing translation services,

00:07:56.959 --> 00:07:58.160
the work didn't stop.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.060
It didn't even slow down.

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:05.160
Bible translations of 2019, 33 were released.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.759
2020, 33 were released.

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:10.560
Add the comments from Wednesday about a country

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.660
that is now having more and more Bible studies

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:16.660
and an increase in interested ones and baptisms.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.959
These are more than just updates.

00:08:18.959 --> 00:08:22.660
These are more than just statistics.

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:27.060
Do we see them as evidences that with us is God

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:30.360
and that He is backing us up in our undertakings?

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.860
That's what we want to understand.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.159
No, we're not perfect.

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:37.960
We'll get there at the end of the thousand year reign

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.559
but compare the leadership and rulership of a manual.

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:43.960
Christ Jesus with the world's leadership.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.759
Look what we have.

00:08:45.759 --> 00:08:48.460
It's wonderful to contemplate.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.159
So what's the lesson for you and me?

00:08:52.159 --> 00:08:56.559
Don't miss the clear evidence that God is with us.

00:08:56.559 --> 00:09:00.360
Keep your spiritual vision sharp and clear.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.309
So here's a tip.

00:09:03.309 --> 00:09:06.210
After reading a portion of the Bible,

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:07.710
ask yourself,

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:14.409
how did Jehovah keep his word in this situation?

00:09:14.409 --> 00:09:19.610
How does this show God is with us today?

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:22.610
Then take that knowledge and assimilate it

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:25.210
into your own life and personal circumstances,

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:31.179
build your confidence in the situation that you are in.

00:09:31.179 --> 00:09:33.879
So what have we learned?

00:09:33.879 --> 00:09:36.779
One, when we know that God is with us,

00:09:36.779 --> 00:09:39.879
we are convinced that He will bless us every time

00:09:39.879 --> 00:09:44.279
we have to bring ourselves into submission to Jehovah.

00:09:44.279 --> 00:09:49.580
And two, in Ahaz Day, Jehovah assured him

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.580
that he would protect the line of David,

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:54.679
not just with words, but with a sign,

00:09:54.679 --> 00:09:58.279
a boy and manual with us is God.

00:09:58.279 --> 00:10:02.179
Today, Jesus in his role as a manual rules

00:10:02.179 --> 00:10:05.580
because our Heavenly King and due to the blessing of his rulership,

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:10.879
we have every reason to declare with confidence with us as God.

00:10:10.879 --> 00:10:14.080
The sign of a manual is all around us.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:19.080
The question is, do we see and appreciate the evidence?
