00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:08.289
Modesty is absolutely essential to having a good relationship with our Heavenly Father,

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:09.289
Jehovah.

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:13.609
We remember what Micah chapter 6 and verse 8 tells us.

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:21.969
He has told you, oh man, what is good and what is Jehovah requiring of you only to exercise

00:00:21.969 --> 00:00:31.410
justice, to cherish loyalty and to walk in modesty with your God.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.530
Now what does modesty mean to you?

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.649
You probably, when you listen to the comments this morning, you heard a variety of different

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:41.250
definitions.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.210
All of them had a common theme, but each one had a slightly different sense.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:53.090
The watchtower of 2000 made some very interesting comments about the definition of modesty.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:00.590
It said, modesty can mean a number of things, such as a lack of conceit or vanity and a

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:07.430
reluctance to boast about one's abilities, achievements and possessions.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:14.189
According to one reference work, modesty also means keeping within bounds.

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.829
A modest person stays within the bounds of good behavior.

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:27.069
He also acknowledges that there are limits to what he ought to do and is able to do.

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:31.390
He knows that there are things to which he is not entitled.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.549
That's a very interesting definition, isn't it?

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.189
And it kind of helps us to see that there's many shades of meaning involved with this

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:40.790
word.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.629
But let's center our discussion this morning on that last thought.

00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:52.269
A modest person acknowledges that there are limits to what he ought to do and is able

00:01:52.269 --> 00:01:53.950
to do.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:00.349
Now to be modest, we understand involves recognizing our own personal limitations.

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:04.909
And sometimes it's easier to be able to see our physical limitations.

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.469
For example, if you're not a strong swimmer, probably when you go to the beach, you won't

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:11.909
swim right out into the ocean, will you?

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:14.229
You'll recognize your limitation.

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:19.789
Or if you're not in good shape, you probably won't sign up for the New York Marathon.

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:26.349
You see, we are able to see that we're not able to do some of these physical tasks.

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:32.789
But modesty goes far beyond just simply acknowledging our own physical limitations.

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:37.949
Now let's look at an example from the scriptures that can help us to see this perhaps more clearly.

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:45.590
Let's go to 1 Samuel, chapter 26, and we're going to start reading here at verse 7.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.030
So 1 Samuel 26, verse 7.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:55.509
Now just to set the context for you here, you'll remember that David had been hiding from

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:59.150
King Saul who was seeking to kill him.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:06.349
Now a golden opportunity came for David now to be able to put an end to Saul and to all

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.870
of this hiding that David had had to be doing for so long.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.710
Now let's read what it says, verse 7.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.909
So David and Abyssal made their way to the troops by night.

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:22.909
They found Saul lying asleep in the camp enclosure with his spear stuck to the ground next to

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:24.669
his head.

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:28.509
Abner and the troops were lying all around him.

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:35.389
Abyssal, I now said to David, today God has surrendered your enemy into your hand.

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:42.229
And now please let me pin him to the ground with the spear just once, and I will not need

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:44.189
to do it twice.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:52.949
However, David said to Abyssal, do not harm him for who can lift his hand against the

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:57.229
anointed of Jehovah and remain innocent.

00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:04.870
David continued, as surely as Jehovah is living, Jehovah himself will strike him down,

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:11.270
or his day will come and he will die, or he will go down into battle and perish.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:16.829
It is unthinkable from Jehovah's standpoint for me to lift my hand against the anointed

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:17.829
of Jehovah.

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:25.310
So now take please the spear next to his head and the water jug and let us be on our way.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:31.350
Well now it would have been so easy for David to kill Saul, right?

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:37.149
But what helped David to act modestly in this situation?

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:40.230
Well, let's consider the first factor.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:45.550
David had to consider his own position or his own authority.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.709
Now had Jehovah instructed David to kill Saul?

00:04:50.709 --> 00:04:51.709
No.

00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:56.189
Jehovah had never assigned David to carry out that task.

00:04:56.189 --> 00:05:02.029
After all, Saul was anointed by Jehovah to be the king of Israel.

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:07.670
So David acknowledged that he simply did not have the authority to kill Saul.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.670
It was not his place.

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.509
But now let's consider a second factor.

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:17.990
Notice verse 10, do you remember what David said?

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:24.829
He said, as surely as Jehovah is living, Jehovah himself will strike him down, or his day

00:05:24.829 --> 00:05:30.069
will come and he will die, or he will go down into battle and perish.

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:32.389
Well, what's the point?

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:36.189
You see, David had complete confidence in Jehovah.

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:42.069
You see, instead of taking matters into his own hands, he had the total confidence

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:48.430
that Jehovah was going to handle this situation in his own way and in his own time.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.550
David modestly trusted in Jehovah.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.790
Well, David acted modestly on that occasion, but perhaps you can think of a few other

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.430
occasions later in his life when he didn't act so modestly.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.910
What's the lesson?

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:12.550
Modesty is a quality that we must work hard to develop, but we must also work hard to

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.069
maintain our modesty.

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:22.470
Otherwise, our minds can begin to focus on our strengths, on our talents, and on our

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:30.709
abilities to such an extent that we begin to get a very distorted view of self.

00:06:30.709 --> 00:06:38.310
When that happens, our modesty can begin to disappear and we can begin to behave presumptuously.

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.990
Now, who's one of the greatest examples of this in the Bible?

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:47.949
Well, perhaps a way you think of the example of Eusiah.

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:53.990
If you go in your Bible to 2 Chronicles chapter 26, let's just review for a minute what

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.589
we know about Eusiah and what happened to him.

00:06:57.589 --> 00:07:03.589
You see in 2 Chronicles 26 and verse 4, do you see what it says?

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:10.350
He, speaking of Eusiah, continued to do what was right in Jehovah's eyes, just as his father

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:14.790
Amaziah had done, and he kept, you notice this?

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:21.470
He kept searching for God in the days of Zechariah who taught him to fear the true God.

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:25.910
During the time he was searching for Jehovah, the true God made him prosper.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.949
Now, do you hear the modesty there?

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:29.949
Did you hear it?

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:36.790
Well, you see, it says Eusiah was not a self-satisfied person at that point in his life.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.350
He was searching for Jehovah.

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:46.310
He felt the need for Jehovah's guidance and wisdom and blessing in his life.

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:48.189
But what happened?

00:07:48.189 --> 00:07:51.149
If you go down to verse 16, do you see?

00:07:51.149 --> 00:07:58.509
However, as soon as he was strong, his heart became hotty to his own ruin.

00:07:58.509 --> 00:08:04.149
And he acted unfaithfully against Jehovah his God by entering the temple of Jehovah to

00:08:04.149 --> 00:08:07.709
burn incense on the altar of incense.

00:08:07.709 --> 00:08:09.230
Can you imagine?

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:14.550
He became so emboldened that he actually went into Jehovah's temple and burned incense

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:16.149
on the altar of incense.

00:08:16.149 --> 00:08:18.750
Well, the priests came running.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:19.910
And what did they say to him?

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:26.910
You see, verse 18, it is not proper for you, Eusiah, to burn incense to Jehovah.

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:29.750
It is only the priests who should burn incense.

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:36.230
For there, the descendants of Aaron, those who have been sanctified, go out from the sanctuary.

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:42.750
For you have acted unfaithfully and you will receive no glory from Jehovah God for this.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:47.350
Well, Eusiah started out fearing God.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:50.789
He started out searching for Jehovah.

00:08:50.789 --> 00:08:54.070
But when he became powerful, what happened?

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:56.750
He quickly lost his modesty.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:02.950
Well, now, brothers, why is this an important discussion really for all of us?

00:09:03.269 --> 00:09:08.149
Well, all of us face trying situations in life.

00:09:08.149 --> 00:09:16.710
And when we face those situations, we may be tempted to want to rush in and handle them.

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:23.710
We may be tempted to ignore Bible principles and even publish direction that we have

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:26.669
from the faithful and discreet slave.

00:09:26.669 --> 00:09:28.269
How wise we are.

00:09:28.269 --> 00:09:35.470
In those moments, in those situations, to step back for a moment, take a deep breath,

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:44.070
account to ten, and say to ourselves, do I really have the authority to do what I'm about to do?

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:48.990
Is it really my place to say what I'm about to say?

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:56.230
Instead, would it be better to wait on Jehovah to correct this situation?

00:09:56.230 --> 00:10:04.029
You see, by having a proper view of self, by sticking closely to the direction that we have from Jehovah

00:10:04.029 --> 00:10:10.110
and from the faithful and discreet slave, and by maintaining our full and complete confidence

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:15.549
that Jehovah will correct any matters that need to be rectified,

00:10:15.549 --> 00:10:19.429
we can have the privilege to walk, not just for a short time,

00:10:19.429 --> 00:10:26.629
but to walk eternally in modesty with our magnificent, our wonderful God, Jehovah.
