00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.620
Welcome to the program, brothers and sisters.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.620
During the next hour, you'll hear the story of a brother

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.619
who previously protected the president of a country.

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:13.619
But seeing the love among God's people made him refocus his life

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:17.620
to bearing witness about the sovereign of the universe.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.620
We cherish our international brotherhood.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.620
Our brothers and sisters in the former Soviet Union

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.620
took great risks during the Cold War to convey their love

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.620
to fellow witnesses on the other side of the globe.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.619
Does our love for Jehovah motivate us to avoid living a double life?

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:40.619
This dramatization will remind us of key principles to protect us

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:43.619
when we're tempted to draw closer to Satan's world.

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:47.619
This is the July program of JW Broadcasting.

00:00:47.619 --> 00:01:09.959
In the book, Inside on the Scriptures, under the heading Christian,

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:14.959
it makes clear that claiming to be Christian requires more than simply

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:17.959
a mere confession of faith.

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:22.959
It is more than being a nominal Christian, a Christian in name only.

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:26.959
For example, according to the Bible, it is necessary that belief

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:30.959
be demonstrated by works, not just words.

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:34.959
And since we were born as sinners, those who become Christians

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:39.959
need to repent, to turn around, to dedicate their lives to Jehovah,

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:44.959
to worship and serve Him, and then to submit to water baptism.

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:49.959
They must keep themselves clean from fornication, from idolatry,

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:51.959
and from consuming blood.

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:57.959
They are to strip off the old personality, including such things as fits of anger,

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:02.959
obscene talk, lying, stealing, drunkenness.

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:07.959
And as Galatians chapter 5 says, things like these.

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:12.960
Yes, they are to bring their lives into accord with Bible principles.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.960
Christians are to be kind and considerate, mild tempered, and patient,

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.960
and are to exercise self-control.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.960
They provide and care for their own, and love their neighbor, as themselves.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.960
That's a lot, isn't it?

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.960
It's not a matter of just glibbly saying, I am a Christian.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.960
But despite all of those impressive characteristics that we just enumerated,

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:46.960
what did Jesus say the main identifying quality of a true Christian would be?

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.960
Most of you know the answer to that.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:56.960
But let's read it again from John 13, 34, and 35.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.960
It says, I am giving you a new commandment that you love one another,

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.960
just as I have loved you.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.960
You also love one another.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:15.960
By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourself.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.960
Those are the theme verses for my discussion with you this month.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.960
The topic is love, the identifying mark of a disciple of Jesus.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:35.960
Did you notice in verse 34 that Jesus said that he was giving them at that time a new commandment?

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.960
But it sounds like a very old commandment, doesn't it?

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.960
Why over 1,500 years before Jesus said that the words we just read,

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:52.960
the law given to Moses said, you must love your fellow man as yourself, Leviticus 1918.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.960
So what was new about Jesus' command in John chapter 13?

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:06.960
He said that true Christians were to love each other just as I have loved you.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.960
That is what was different.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.960
That was new.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:20.959
Not just love the other person as you love yourself, but love him just like Jesus loved his followers.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.959
Well, what kind of love would that be?

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:26.959
Self-sacrificing love.

00:04:26.959 --> 00:04:32.959
And usually we think of Jesus' ultimate sacrifice, his willingly giving his life,

00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:37.959
so that we might have the hope of everlasting life.

00:04:37.959 --> 00:04:45.959
But when you think about it, that aspect of Jesus' love was simplified and a self-sacrificing death.

00:04:45.959 --> 00:04:52.959
Now it's true that as a Christian we might, at some time, have to give our life for a fellow Christian.

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:54.959
But we hope it doesn't come to that.

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:59.959
So instead of talking about a self-sacrificing death,

00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:07.959
we want to discuss showing this new kind of love as evidenced in a self-sacrificing life.

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:09.959
Not necessarily our death.

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:15.959
You see, Jesus' life, his three-and-a-half year ministry,

00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:20.959
was a self-sacrificing life of loving others.

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:26.959
In addition to doing good when something requires it,

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:33.959
a true follower of Jesus is to take the initiative to help others spiritually and otherwise.

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:36.959
He has to work actively for their good.

00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:40.959
They preaching and teaching of the good news to others,

00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:43.959
some of whom may even be hostile,

00:05:43.959 --> 00:05:46.959
is one of the greatest expressions of love,

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:50.959
for it can result in everlasting life to the recipients.

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:56.959
However, according to Paul's words at 1 Thessalonians 2 verse 8,

00:05:56.959 --> 00:06:01.959
a true Christian must impart not only the good news of God,

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:08.959
but also his very self in helping those who accept the good news.

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:15.959
It's that kind of love that Jesus said would be an identifying mark of his disciples,

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:22.959
not specifically that his followers would all be dying for each other,

00:06:22.959 --> 00:06:27.959
but more so that they would all be living for each other.

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:33.959
Yes, displaying self-sacrificing love for one another every day of their lives.

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:39.959
The four gospels are a treasure trove of Jesus' self-sacrificing love,

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:45.959
and yet they do not cover his actions every day of his life as the Christ.

00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:52.959
History in a half-year ministry amounts to nearly 1,300 days of life and love.

00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:56.959
The written record of Jesus' life is admittedly brief,

00:06:56.959 --> 00:06:59.959
but it is grand indeed.

00:06:59.959 --> 00:07:08.959
However, the reality of observing Jesus every day must have been far grander than what we have in print.

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:13.959
What we have in print might be likened to a photo album of Jesus' life,

00:07:13.959 --> 00:07:16.959
some snap shots.

00:07:16.959 --> 00:07:23.959
By comparison, what his apostles' experience with Jesus' day after day

00:07:23.959 --> 00:07:28.959
was like a continuous video of his example of love.

00:07:28.959 --> 00:07:34.959
No wonder that at John, chapter 21, verse 25, the apostles said,

00:07:34.959 --> 00:07:39.959
there are also many other things that Jesus did,

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:43.959
which if ever they were written in full detail,

00:07:43.959 --> 00:07:49.959
I suppose the world itself could not contain the scrolls written.

00:07:49.959 --> 00:07:53.959
It said there were many other things.

00:07:53.959 --> 00:08:00.959
Jesus did not many other things that he said, but that he did.

00:08:00.959 --> 00:08:06.959
Yes, deeds or acts demonstrating his self-sacrificing life of love.

00:08:06.959 --> 00:08:12.959
We already mentioned the all-important preaching work as being an act of love on our part,

00:08:12.959 --> 00:08:18.959
but how else do we manifest the most obvious trait of a genuine Christian?

00:08:18.959 --> 00:08:22.959
Love like Jesus had.

00:08:22.959 --> 00:08:26.959
Let's start by thinking of the elders and the congregation.

00:08:26.959 --> 00:08:29.959
At the Philippians chapter 2, verse 17,

00:08:29.959 --> 00:08:36.960
Paul said that he had poured himself out to the congregation like a drink offering.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.960
What did that mean?

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:43.960
It meant that he drained himself out, both physically and emotionally,

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.960
to support the Philippians.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:53.960
Many of the elders in our congregations have the same self-sacrificing love for those under their care.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.960
They give of their time to shepherd and readjust those in need.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.960
They take the lead in the ministry.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.960
They respond when there is a serious health issue or tragedy.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:11.960
They pour themselves out for the friends, thus identifying themselves as disciples of Christ.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:17.960
But we do not have to be an elder to provide a word of encouragement, Dewey.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:23.960
If we all keep focused on others in the congregation, not just ourselves,

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:30.960
we will know who needs to be bolstered because of trials or circumstances that they face.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.960
Giving in this way is evidence of Christ-like love.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.960
You may be thinking,

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:44.960
but I am just a little old sister who finds it hard to squeeze out a word of encouragement to others.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.960
Perhaps you do not have to say anything.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:53.960
Just be there at the meetings or in the service.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.960
When others see your face, they are encouraged.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:02.960
Follow along as I read Acts chapter 28 and verse 15.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.960
It reads,

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:13.960
From there the brothers when they heard the news about us came as far as the marketplace of Appius and three taverns to meet us.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:17.960
On catching sight of them,

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.960
Paul thanked God and took courage.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:30.269
Paul took courage just by seeing the brothers who came out to meet Him.

00:10:30.269 --> 00:10:35.269
You encourage your brothers and sisters by your presence.

00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:41.269
Please follow along as I read Philippians chapter 2, 1 through 4.

00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:46.269
Paul here describes it as encouragement in Christ.

00:10:46.269 --> 00:10:47.269
He says,

00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:51.269
If then there is any encouragement in Christ.

00:10:51.269 --> 00:10:54.269
If any consolation of love,

00:10:54.269 --> 00:10:57.269
if any spiritual fellowship,

00:10:57.269 --> 00:11:00.269
if any tender affection and compassion,

00:11:00.269 --> 00:11:07.269
make my joy full by being of the same mind and having the same love,

00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:11.269
being completely united, having the one thought in mind,

00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:17.269
do nothing out of contentiousness or out of egotism but with humility.

00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:21.269
Consider others superior to you.

00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:25.269
As you look out not only for your own interests,

00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:29.269
but also for the interests of others.

00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:35.269
Did you notice the self-sacrificing aspect of this love and encouragement?

00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:37.269
Yes, he talked about having love,

00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:39.269
but then he said,

00:11:39.269 --> 00:11:41.269
Not for your own interests,

00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:44.269
but for the interests of others.

00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:47.269
That type of love in the interests of others

00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:51.269
is the identifying mark of true Christians.

00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:54.269
What about visiting the sick in your congregation

00:11:54.269 --> 00:11:57.269
or those who are housebound?

00:11:57.269 --> 00:12:01.269
Sometimes these dear ones are out of sight, out of mind.

00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:05.269
We visit with those we see when at the kingdom hall,

00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:10.269
but do we think about those who are shut-ins?

00:12:10.269 --> 00:12:15.269
What was a major part of Jesus' loving acts went on earth?

00:12:15.269 --> 00:12:19.269
Our numerous accounts of Jesus and His apostles healing the sick.

00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:23.269
It's true that we cannot heal the sick,

00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:28.269
but it is in our power to visit the sick.

00:12:28.269 --> 00:12:31.269
And what a healing that is to their spirit.

00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:37.269
It means so much when they are not just prayed for at a meeting,

00:12:37.269 --> 00:12:42.269
but when those words of prayer are backed up with an act of love,

00:12:42.269 --> 00:12:45.269
a visit to them in person,

00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:50.269
that is Christ-like love and action.

00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:54.269
Why not scroll down the list of those in your service group

00:12:54.269 --> 00:12:57.269
with the thought in mind of checking on those

00:12:57.269 --> 00:13:00.269
who have been missing from the meetings?

00:13:00.269 --> 00:13:02.269
Do they need a meal?

00:13:02.269 --> 00:13:04.269
Do they need some help?

00:13:04.269 --> 00:13:06.269
Perhaps around the house?

00:13:06.269 --> 00:13:10.269
Do they need transportation to the doctor?

00:13:10.269 --> 00:13:14.269
Can we allow our love to expand to fill their needs?

00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:16.269
Contributing to the worldwide work,

00:13:16.269 --> 00:13:19.269
which cares for the needs of our brothers around the world,

00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:22.269
is another act of love.

00:13:22.269 --> 00:13:26.269
It demonstrates that we are a true disciple of Christ.

00:13:26.269 --> 00:13:31.269
Related to that, many of you have at your own expense traveled

00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:37.269
to far-fung places to help rebuild after a natural disaster history.

00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:41.269
The overwhelming response from the victims is evidence

00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:46.269
of your self-sacrificing life and love for your brothers.

00:13:46.269 --> 00:13:51.269
It is hoped that the reminder of Jesus at John 1334 and 35

00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:53.269
will be good for all of us,

00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:55.269
not just for this month,

00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:59.269
but for our whole course of life.

00:13:59.269 --> 00:14:04.269
You know about one-third of the world's population claims to be Christian,

00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:12.269
but how many of them show self-sacrificing love outside of their immediate family.

00:14:12.269 --> 00:14:16.269
Most are like a baseball team in a uniform.

00:14:16.269 --> 00:14:21.269
They think having the word Christian emblazoned across the front of their uniform

00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:24.269
is all that is required.

00:14:24.269 --> 00:14:30.269
However, most of them simply sit on the bench or on a pew entrance.

00:14:30.269 --> 00:14:33.269
And many do not even attend the game.

00:14:33.269 --> 00:14:37.269
They do not live the life of a Christian.

00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:44.269
Jesus made clear that being a true disciple of his is not merely wearing a uniform.

00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:47.269
Simply claiming to be his follower.

00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:53.269
No, it involves actively demonstrating works of love,

00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:56.269
swing hard for the team,

00:14:56.269 --> 00:15:00.269
imitating the all-time greatest examples of love,

00:15:00.269 --> 00:15:04.269
Jehovah God and his son Jesus Christ.

00:15:04.269 --> 00:15:08.269
As Paul said his second Corinthians chapter 8 verse 8,

00:15:08.269 --> 00:15:13.269
we need to test the genuineness of our love.

00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:19.269
Yes, we need to daily prove that we are a genuine disciple of Jesus.

00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:26.269
Brother Ryan Mueller will now share some examples of how the Bible principles we just discussed

00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:29.269
have helped people around the world, Alex.

00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:32.269
Thank you, Brother Heard, for that warm encouragement.

00:15:32.269 --> 00:15:37.269
We're more motivated than never to prove our love for Jehovah and others.

00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:41.269
We recently met Mamuka Taktu Manashvili from the country of Georgia.

00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:46.269
He was a high-ranking officer in the special forces there for many years.

00:15:46.269 --> 00:15:53.269
What made him realize that defending his country is not the highest honor a man can have in his life?

00:15:53.269 --> 00:16:18.289
This is his story.

00:16:19.289 --> 00:16:24.289
For 18 years I served in a special unit responsible for presidential security.

00:16:24.289 --> 00:16:27.289
This mission demanded total self-sacrifice.

00:16:27.289 --> 00:16:32.289
For example, the first and the last vehicles of the presidential escort belong to this unit.

00:16:32.289 --> 00:16:37.289
So if an attack occurred on the president, we were the first ones to be hit with the fire.

00:16:37.289 --> 00:16:50.299
For the last 10 years of service, I worked as an instructor and trained new staff to provide presidential security in the future.

00:16:50.299 --> 00:16:53.299
Those working in this field must be fearless.

00:16:53.299 --> 00:16:55.299
They must be professionals.

00:16:55.299 --> 00:17:02.570
And that is what I taught to succeeding generations.

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:05.569
I just love my job.

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:07.569
I was a fervent patriot.

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:10.569
I had a special regard for the flag of my country.

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:13.569
In one bag, I always had weapons and the flag.

00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:22.200
Patriotism was so deep-rooted in me that I would beat up a person simply because he was of another nationality.

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:30.380
I always thought that God would never allow people like me to draw close to him.

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:33.380
One day, Jehovah's Witnesses came and preached to my wife and me.

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:38.380
We were so interested in the truth that my wife even expressed the desire to study the Bible.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.380
Because there were rumors circulating about Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:45.380
I decided first to make sure that everything was decent that their meetings,

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:48.380
and only then allow my wife to associate with them.

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.380
After the meeting, I was absolutely thrilled.

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:54.380
Everyone was well-mannered with friendly smiling faces.

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:59.380
I realized that there was nothing there to threaten my wife's well-being.

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:03.380
On the contrary, their association would be beneficial for her.

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.380
Soon my wife and our eldest daughter got baptized.

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:10.380
As for me, I enjoyed associating with Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:13.380
Later, I also started to study the Bible.

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:16.380
I knew that I had to make drastic changes in my life,

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:20.380
but my job prevented me from doing so.

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:26.380
Moreover, I felt that door-to-door preaching was far more difficult than engaging in combat.

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:32.380
I respected Jehovah's Witnesses for their courage and strength.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:35.380
Little by little, I too was changing for the better.

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:42.490
I wanted to quit my job and inform my colleagues about my religious beliefs.

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:45.490
So I wrote down all the Bible verses I had recently learned

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:50.859
and then pinned them on the wall in my office.

00:18:50.859 --> 00:18:53.859
I also started to think about how to make a living after leaving my job

00:18:53.859 --> 00:18:56.859
and decided to learn a trade.

00:18:56.859 --> 00:19:00.859
I started to buy tools in order to be ready to take care of my family.

00:19:00.859 --> 00:19:04.859
I realized that the time had come to make a decision.

00:19:06.859 --> 00:19:11.859
The day I quit my job was one of the happiest days of my life.

00:19:11.859 --> 00:19:15.859
Since then, I have been able to dedicate every minute of my life to Jehovah

00:19:15.859 --> 00:19:17.859
with a clean conscience.

00:19:17.859 --> 00:19:20.859
In a few months, I got baptized.

00:19:20.859 --> 00:19:23.859
In the beginning, we were hardly making a living.

00:19:23.859 --> 00:19:27.859
However, this taught me to trust in Jehovah.

00:19:27.859 --> 00:19:30.859
I tried my best to keep service to Jehovah in first place.

00:19:30.859 --> 00:19:35.859
I deeply appreciate the support of my brothers and sisters and association with them.

00:19:35.859 --> 00:19:50.950
Before, I used to carry out the orders of men,

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:53.950
some of which I carried out reluctantly.

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:56.950
But now I am happy to carry out an assignment from Jehovah

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:59.950
with the same spirit that the prophet Isaiah had, who said,

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:02.950
here I am, send me.

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:05.950
As a family, we decided to move where the need was greater.

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:08.950
And this has united our family even more.

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:14.859
This is the bag in which I always carried weapons.

00:20:14.859 --> 00:20:18.859
But now they are replaced with the Bible and Bible literature.

00:20:18.859 --> 00:20:22.859
In the past, I thought I could never preach from door to door.

00:20:22.859 --> 00:20:27.859
But now I can say with conviction that the words of Jesus have proved true in my case.

00:20:27.859 --> 00:20:31.859
All things are possible with God.

00:20:31.859 --> 00:20:40.789
Brother Tech to Manashvili now serves as an elder.

00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:44.789
And he's also been a regular pioneer since 2014.

00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:48.789
While Brother Tech to Manashvili served the government for many years,

00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:51.789
there are those who live on the other side of the law.

00:20:51.789 --> 00:20:55.789
How does Jehovah's Unprejudiced love reach out to them?

00:20:55.789 --> 00:21:00.789
Join us as we travel to the Democratic Republic of Congo in Africa,

00:21:00.789 --> 00:21:07.789
where our brothers make special efforts to reach people we would not normally find from door to door.

00:21:07.789 --> 00:21:18.369
I could say that my past was really an unhappy past.

00:21:18.369 --> 00:21:23.369
I went through very difficult times during my childhood.

00:21:23.369 --> 00:21:29.369
I lost hope that I could ever have a better life.

00:21:30.369 --> 00:21:36.869
Because of that, I started to associate with the wrong people in my life.

00:21:36.869 --> 00:21:41.869
One night I was arrested and sent a bolo prison.

00:21:41.869 --> 00:21:50.500
It is a high security prison in Congo.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.500
Prison is a very dangerous place.

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:56.500
But I was surprised how they accepted the truth so easily.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:00.500
Really, I was amazed.

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:05.500
We needed to obtain permission to be able to continue to preach in the prison.

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:11.099
I had so enjoyed the preaching work there.

00:22:11.099 --> 00:22:16.099
I went to see the authorities in the city to find out what was required

00:22:16.099 --> 00:22:21.470
so that we could have permission to preach in the prison.

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:27.470
To my great amazement, they simply handed me a paper and told me to put my request in writing.

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:29.470
They asked me to wait.

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:35.470
Within minutes, I had the authorization in my hands without paying anything at all.

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:41.470
Every time the situation seemed insurmountable to us, impossible to us.

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:49.289
We saw the hand of Jehovah providing us with the suitable solution.

00:22:49.289 --> 00:22:53.289
The authorization gave a great boost to the special witnessing initiative.

00:22:53.289 --> 00:22:58.289
In harmony with 1 Corinthians 9 verses 22 and 23,

00:22:58.289 --> 00:23:02.289
the brothers could then become all things to people of all sorts,

00:23:02.289 --> 00:23:07.289
so that they might by all possible means save some.

00:23:08.289 --> 00:23:14.289
Some religious leaders, who were also prisoners, were extremely opposed to our presence.

00:23:14.289 --> 00:23:20.289
They conspired and had us thrown out of our meeting place.

00:23:20.289 --> 00:23:24.289
The prisoners themselves were concerned about this.

00:23:24.289 --> 00:23:28.289
They found another meeting place even more spacious than the former.

00:23:28.289 --> 00:23:39.140
Since Boulevard is 8 kilometers away from our congregation,

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:42.140
to transport the group who support the preaching organ meetings,

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:48.140
the body of elders organized too many buses to go out every Saturday to Boulevard.

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:56.140
Once they arrived, they began the preaching work at 8.30 and at 10 o'clock the meetings start.

00:23:56.140 --> 00:24:03.460
All the meetings of the week are held on the Saturday.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:07.460
Concerning Jehovah's Witnesses personally, I'm very impressed.

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:11.460
It's more than three years, they've been more active in helping the detainees.

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:15.460
The re-education of the prisoners is assured by Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:19.460
This is a good collaboration on the part of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:30.079
With this, I'm very happy.

00:24:30.079 --> 00:24:34.079
175 attended the Circuit Assembly in December 2014,

00:24:34.079 --> 00:24:39.079
which was held in the prison, and seven were baptized.

00:24:39.079 --> 00:24:44.829
Local media covered the event.

00:24:44.829 --> 00:24:50.829
This is the first time I've seen Jehovah's Witnesses baptized here in the Boulevard prison.

00:24:50.829 --> 00:24:55.829
This is a good thing. I encourage you to continue with this assistance.

00:24:55.829 --> 00:25:02.829
Every week, there are more than 18 attendants, and sometimes more than that, even 140.

00:25:02.829 --> 00:25:07.829
In the attendance, there are the 36 publishers, the brothers who learned the truth in Boulevard prison,

00:25:07.829 --> 00:25:15.660
30 are baptized and 6 are baptized.

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:19.660
I visited many churches because I had a lot of questions,

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:25.660
but I never got any exact answers.

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:31.660
When I went to see Jehovah's Witnesses, they gave me accurate answers from the Bible

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:39.660
to know that Jehovah is compassionate and ready to forgive these other qualities that touched me.

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:45.509
I used to be a soldier. I was in the military.

00:25:45.509 --> 00:25:50.509
I attended various churches because I had a question that bothered me a lot.

00:25:50.509 --> 00:25:57.509
I wondered why God allows bad things to happen to people all the time.

00:25:57.509 --> 00:26:07.509
While I was in prison, Jehovah's Witnesses came to visit and talk to us.

00:26:07.509 --> 00:26:14.509
I asked them the same question, why does God allow sickness and suffering to continue?

00:26:14.509 --> 00:26:18.509
They replied by using three Bible verses.

00:26:18.509 --> 00:26:25.509
I was very happy because I received the answer to my question.

00:26:25.509 --> 00:26:33.650
Papiokito is a brother who learned the truth in prison.

00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:41.650
He made such remarkable progress that those in charge now have confidence in him.

00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:47.650
Like Joseph in the Bible, he has been placed in a position of supervision over the other prisoners.

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:55.650
He also made further progress, and thus the management has requested that his prison sentence be reduced.

00:26:55.650 --> 00:27:00.990
When I arrived in the prison, I had lost hope.

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:02.990
I thought for me it was the end.

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:07.990
By means of the Bible, I have found joy and hope in my life.

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:32.059
That is why today I am happy, even though I am still here, but I know that the paradise is for me.

00:27:32.059 --> 00:27:36.059
It has been five years since the brothers started preaching in the Bulu prison.

00:27:36.059 --> 00:27:41.059
At times, the publishers placed up to 500 magazines in one weekend.

00:27:41.059 --> 00:27:45.059
Although our success is not measured by the number of placements,

00:27:45.059 --> 00:27:51.059
this response does paint a clear picture of the spiritual thirst among these prisoners.

00:27:51.059 --> 00:27:58.059
In the last few months, inside these prison walls, 11 more unbaptized publishers have been approved.

00:27:58.059 --> 00:28:07.059
What a loving act by Jehovah and his organization to help such individuals satisfy their spiritual needs.

00:28:07.059 --> 00:28:15.059
In the late 1950s, the opposition against Jehovah's Witnesses in the former Soviet Union resulted in homes being searched,

00:28:15.059 --> 00:28:24.059
brothers being followed, and many of our brothers and sisters being sent to communist concentration camps in Siberia among other places.

00:28:24.059 --> 00:28:35.059
In 1956 and 1957, over 462,000 convention delegates worldwide unanimously adopted a petition,

00:28:35.059 --> 00:28:39.059
which clearly outlined the treatment Jehovah's Witnesses were enduring.

00:28:39.059 --> 00:28:45.059
It was sent to the Soviet authorities, but sadly not much changed.

00:28:45.059 --> 00:28:51.059
The next year, at the 1958 International Convention at Yankee Stadium in New York,

00:28:51.059 --> 00:28:55.059
a talk was given entitled Behind the Iron Curtain.

00:28:55.059 --> 00:29:03.059
During the talk, delegates were surprised when a recording of greetings and songs from brothers and sisters in the Soviet Union was played.

00:29:03.059 --> 00:29:09.059
Despite the risk of losing their freedom, the brothers produced and sent these recordings.

00:29:09.059 --> 00:29:17.059
Well, a few months ago, some of those who were involved in making the recording were able to listen to it for the first time.

00:29:18.059 --> 00:29:24.059
Several of them found out only then that the recording had been played at the convention at Yankee Stadium.

00:29:24.059 --> 00:29:43.640
Our team was present at that gathering.

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:48.640
The brothers told us to prepare songs for a recording.

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:55.640
When we were singing, I never imagined that it was for a convention, because I did not know about that.

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:58.640
We sang as usual.

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:12.690
The chorus was made up of about 20 persons, and the recording was made in a room in a barrack-like building.

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:17.690
I just looked after the chorus to give them the right tone.

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:21.690
If someone sang a little off key, she would right away remark,

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:32.539
halt us, you are off, or tenor, you are off, so that there would be no slips, no mistakes.

00:30:32.539 --> 00:30:37.539
We had to be very careful when we were recording.

00:30:37.539 --> 00:30:41.539
And so we knew not to talk. I could not tell anyone about it.

00:30:41.539 --> 00:30:50.029
It was secret, absolutely secret.

00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:56.029
They chose a brother who spoke very good Russian, who had good intonation, and who had a good voice.

00:30:56.029 --> 00:31:03.029
And as I recall, we made the recording on our first attempt.

00:31:03.029 --> 00:31:08.029
Brother Yuri Davichin said the greetings.

00:31:36.549 --> 00:31:47.930
As the brothers who made the recording told me, the most difficult assignment for them was how to get this recording across the border.

00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:57.930
The brothers cut it up into pieces and sewed it into the lining of a jacket, because that's how confidential letters were sent.

00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:08.930
One married couple from Poland, who were vacationing in Russia, agreed to take it back with them, to take it out of the Soviet Union.

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:17.420
And that's where they ran into serious problems.

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:21.420
From Brother Shiders letter, we received the audio recording in Poland.

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:28.910
The security officers separated our brother from the others.

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:36.480
Then an officer said to him, please give us the film and the three letters you have with you.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:42.480
The brother saw now, of course, that there had been a traitor somewhere. He and his wife were now thoroughly searched.

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:48.480
Every square centimeter of their cases was carefully examined, together with their contents.

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:51.480
Then, both were stripped naked.

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:58.480
While this was going on, they yelled at the brother, tell us where you have hidden everything, or to whom you have given it.

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:03.480
They were absolutely convinced that he had everything with him.

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:13.480
Several times, they took him to the office of the Frontier Police and to the Security Police, searching him again and again and being terribly angry.

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:16.480
But they finally had to give up.

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:22.480
They kept him back for 24 hours and questioned him in the presence of 10 specialists.

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:30.380
But he came out victorious.

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:38.380
Sadly, even the brothers who were involved don't know who this couple who brought the tape into Poland was.

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:46.380
And now we have yet a surprise for you. A message directly from our brothers in Russia to this convention.

00:33:46.380 --> 00:34:19.380
And now we give you a part of their message to you in Russia.

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:46.820
Thank you so much to all of you, God and God, we can live and work hard.

00:34:46.820 --> 00:35:00.820
In the last period, in the end of the Second World War, the real time, the last, quite difficult and difficult path of fighting for the protection of faith and independence in this old world.

00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:07.820
However, due to all the difficulties, the defeat, the defeat, the repression, we are also very happy.

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:18.820
We are happy, we have had all the great people come to know the history of the old people, the great people of the past and the great people of Jesus Christ.

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:28.940
Well, for me it was of course a great joy, since the goal was reached after all.

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:33.940
Everything was so wonderful at that time. I really enjoyed it all.

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:36.940
Nothing could describe the joy I felt.

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:40.940
I was overwhelmed with feelings.

00:35:40.940 --> 00:36:12.570
These dear brothers and sisters have no regrets.

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:17.570
They are happy that their efforts encourage so many thousands back then and today.

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:24.570
The kind of love these brothers and sisters showed is often noticed by those not in the truth.

00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:29.570
A young couple from the United States, Jeremiah and Holly Draper,

00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:33.570
experienced just that.

00:36:33.570 --> 00:36:43.940
The blessings that I enjoy today are so numerous.

00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:49.940
I have a true inner sense of joy and happiness.

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:55.940
I can't help but be appreciative, so grateful for all that Jehovah does.

00:36:55.940 --> 00:37:00.940
But it wasn't always this way for us.

00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:16.170
It wasn't always this way for us.

00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:22.750
It was a dark world growing up.

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:29.300
I never knew what being a child was like.

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:35.420
I was afraid of who I would grow up to be.

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:39.760
I felt like I had no choice.

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:45.760
I did at a very young age, I as well started to partake of what I saw going on around me.

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:50.760
I learned quickly that it helps numb the feelings that I had.

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:54.760
Drugs were a way to escape that.

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:56.760
I was in a lot of trouble with the law.

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:59.760
I knew I needed change.

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:05.010
So I joined the military at a young age.

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:09.010
Around my teenage years, my life became difficult.

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:14.010
I started to turn to drugs and alcohol and self-destructive ways.

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:17.010
But none of these things were making me happy.

00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:20.010
I was very lonely.

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:21.010
No one knew me.

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:24.010
No one cared to know me.

00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:26.010
I felt so lost.

00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:32.010
And I was trying to fill this big hole in my heart with so many things.

00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:35.010
And none of it worked.

00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:40.010
One of my many car accidents due to drugs and alcohol.

00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:49.389
Ended me up in jail for 30 days straight.

00:38:49.389 --> 00:38:53.389
I felt like a hopeless mass.

00:38:53.389 --> 00:38:57.389
I just knew something's got to change.

00:38:57.389 --> 00:39:05.389
So I joined the military thinking it was going to be the positive, great change that I needed.

00:39:05.389 --> 00:39:08.389
But it was not.

00:39:08.389 --> 00:39:15.389
I remember joining the military, hoping that it would bring some sort of authority into my life.

00:39:15.389 --> 00:39:24.389
But I again started to spiral into my anger, my alcohol and drug abuse.

00:39:24.389 --> 00:39:29.389
The military decided to let me out.

00:39:29.389 --> 00:39:33.389
But during deployment is where I met Holly.

00:39:33.389 --> 00:39:36.389
Holly also got out of the military.

00:39:36.389 --> 00:39:39.389
And we started to live a life together.

00:39:39.389 --> 00:39:44.389
But we were still searching for something to fill the emptiness that we both felt in our lives.

00:39:46.389 --> 00:39:51.389
Jeremiah and I were both working in a steel factory in Montana.

00:39:51.389 --> 00:39:57.389
During this time, I was being trained on a drill by one of Jova's witnesses, a sister named Molly.

00:39:57.389 --> 00:40:01.389
Molly said, you're going to have downtime on this machine.

00:40:01.389 --> 00:40:05.389
Maybe a couple hours, so feel free to read whatever I have in my toolbox.

00:40:05.389 --> 00:40:10.670
I opened it and immediately a little yellow book.

00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:13.670
What does the Bible really teach caught my eye?

00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:17.670
I love the pictures, the scriptures and the beginning of the book.

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:19.670
They touched my heart immediately.

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:26.670
And I felt like these answer all the questions I've been searching for my entire life.

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:29.670
Another sister came over, her name was Corey.

00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:34.670
And she said, Molly and I can come over and we can talk to you about the Bible tomorrow.

00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:38.670
If you have any questions, we'd love to answer them using the Bible.

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:41.670
I said, yes, come over.

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:43.670
I was a little bit more apprehensive.

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:45.670
I stayed just to make sure nothing got weird.

00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:49.670
But this was finally something very different.

00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:53.670
And I realized what they were saying came from the Bible.

00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:55.670
I've never seen that before.

00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:58.670
They invited us to the Kingdom Hall.

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:03.670
We went in, everybody had their Bible, had time to look the scriptures up together.

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:06.670
And everybody was so warm and inviting.

00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:10.670
These were the people I've been searching for my entire life.

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:13.670
All of a sudden change was possible.

00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:16.670
We knew what changes we needed to make in our life.

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:21.670
What we were doing, our actions, we had to clear out things that Jehovah hates.

00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:25.670
Like, just going through our house and deciding what it is, do we need to get rid of?

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:30.670
By allowing the truth to transform our lives, Holly and I have received many blessings.

00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:34.670
And eventually, we were able to come here together and serve at Bethel.

00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:36.670
We got the truth in a world shop.

00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:40.670
And now I get to weld here in Jehovah's house for him.

00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:46.670
I perform maintenance on water fountains, refrigerators, coolers.

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:52.670
Being trained by the brothers and sisters I work with just helps me to refine my Christian personality.

00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:57.670
It's so nice to know that Jehovah is looking down on us.

00:41:57.670 --> 00:42:02.670
That he was able to see through all of the trash that was there in our life.

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:06.670
He was able to find something and decided to work with it.

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:11.670
And I really think of a scripture Psalm 145 verse 19.

00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:16.670
He satisfies the desire of those who fear him.

00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:21.670
He hears their cries for help and rescues them.

00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:23.670
Jehovah did that for us.

00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:30.670
If you asked Jehovah to display his hand in your life, no doubt at all in my mind that will happen.

00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:42.420
Did you notice how Jeremiah and Holly were touched by the Christian love shown to them when they visited the kingdom hall for the first time?

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:47.420
Jeremiah said that everybody was so warm and inviting.

00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:53.420
Yes, love truly is the identifying mark of Jesus' disciples.

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:59.420
But Jesus taught that love for fellow believers in our neighbor is second to our love for Jehovah.

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:09.420
Being kind and encouraging to others is of little value if it's not rooted in a deep desire to please our Heavenly Father.

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:17.420
In the following dramatization, a young brother is reminded of the value of carefully examining his heart.

00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:32.449
My name is Sean.

00:43:32.449 --> 00:43:36.619
I was raised in the truth.

00:43:36.619 --> 00:43:38.619
I was doing everything right.

00:43:38.619 --> 00:44:17.980
But I was doing everything wrong.

00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:20.980
I was in my senior year of high school.

00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:23.980
Everything was going great.

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:37.110
Until this new girl joined our school, I really don't know how it even started.

00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:41.110
We just sort of hit it off and became good friends.

00:44:41.110 --> 00:45:11.889
I mean, she was so easy to talk to.

00:45:11.889 --> 00:45:15.889
Before I knew it, we were texting all the time.

00:45:15.889 --> 00:45:21.349
Then, one thing led to another.

00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:26.349
Honestly, when things started to get physical, I thought I could control it.

00:45:26.349 --> 00:45:42.219
But it was only getting worse.

00:45:42.219 --> 00:45:45.219
I didn't want to let my parents down.

00:45:45.219 --> 00:45:51.090
So I started lying to them.

00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:57.489
And then I started lying to myself.

00:45:57.489 --> 00:46:07.380
I thought if I could just keep going to the meetings and do my parts, it could somehow be okay.

00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:13.949
But I was far from okay.

00:46:13.949 --> 00:46:19.000
The next night, we had family worship.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:29.380
We were reading about the account of Ananias and his wife, Sophia.

00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:35.380
When a special fund was set up for Needy Christians, Ananias sold a field.

00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:41.380
But then he boldly claimed he was contributing the entire proceeds of its sale.

00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:48.380
In reality, though, Ananias had secretly held back some of the price for his personal gain.

00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:51.380
Peter boldly said to him,

00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:53.380
You have lied.

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:56.380
Not to men, but to God.

00:46:56.380 --> 00:47:05.500
Jehovah wasn't fooled by their pretence.

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:09.500
Then we read Psalm 4421.

00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:25.130
God is aware of the secrets of the heart.

00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:29.130
Reading this account of Ananias and Sophia made me realize,

00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:40.900
I wasn't just lying to my parents or my friends.

00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:50.320
I was lying to Jehovah as much as I didn't want to let my parents down.

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:54.320
Even more so, I didn't want to let Jehovah down.

00:47:54.320 --> 00:48:05.639
I prayed long that night.

00:48:05.639 --> 00:48:14.780
I didn't hold anything back.

00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:51.429
By the next morning, I knew what I wanted to do.

00:48:51.429 --> 00:48:55.429
It wasn't easy, but my parents were very supportive.

00:48:56.429 --> 00:48:59.429
And I also got the help I needed from the elders.

00:48:59.429 --> 00:49:16.840
It's been a few years, but as I look back now,

00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:22.559
I was one of those kids living in double life.

00:49:22.559 --> 00:49:33.159
But now, with Jehovah's help, I'm living the best life.

00:49:33.159 --> 00:49:35.159
What a clear warning this is.

00:49:35.159 --> 00:49:41.159
Not only for young ones, but also for those of us who've served Jehovah for many, many years.

00:49:41.159 --> 00:49:46.159
As we well know, serving Jehovah faithfully for many decades

00:49:46.159 --> 00:49:50.159
is only valuable if we endure to the end.

00:49:50.159 --> 00:49:53.159
By developing intense love for Jehovah,

00:49:53.159 --> 00:49:58.159
we'll be able to overcome whatever temptations or trials we face.

00:49:58.159 --> 00:50:00.159
And speaking of enduring to the end,

00:50:00.159 --> 00:50:04.159
Brother Mark Sanderson recently spoke at Morning Worship in Bethel

00:50:04.159 --> 00:50:08.159
about how our eager expectation of the day of Jehovah

00:50:08.159 --> 00:50:12.159
will help us to endure faithfully in this system of things.

00:50:12.159 --> 00:50:18.159
A close attention to some of the ways we show such expectation.

00:50:18.159 --> 00:50:21.159
Well, here's the question we want to ask this morning.

00:50:21.159 --> 00:50:26.159
Is it actually possible to speed up the day of Jehovah?

00:50:26.159 --> 00:50:33.159
Well, if we look at our text this morning in 2 Peter 3 and verse 11,

00:50:33.159 --> 00:50:35.159
we've had that read for us.

00:50:35.159 --> 00:50:39.159
So we know that expression at the end that we should consider

00:50:39.159 --> 00:50:44.159
what sort of people you want to be in holy acts of conduct

00:50:44.159 --> 00:50:46.159
and deeds of God the devotion.

00:50:46.159 --> 00:50:48.159
But then it goes on to say,

00:50:48.159 --> 00:50:55.159
as you await and keep close in mind the presence of the day of Jehovah.

00:50:55.159 --> 00:51:00.159
Well, now if you look at the footnote on this expression in verse 12,

00:51:00.159 --> 00:51:05.159
you'll notice that the expression keep close in mind literally means

00:51:05.159 --> 00:51:09.159
to speed up the day of Jehovah.

00:51:09.159 --> 00:51:11.159
Well, now how can we do that?

00:51:11.159 --> 00:51:13.159
Well, it's true.

00:51:13.159 --> 00:51:17.159
We cannot bring the day forward of Jehovah even one day

00:51:17.159 --> 00:51:20.159
nor can we move it back even one day.

00:51:20.159 --> 00:51:22.159
That is not within our power.

00:51:22.159 --> 00:51:24.159
That day is set.

00:51:24.159 --> 00:51:29.159
But how can we then speed up the day of Jehovah?

00:51:29.159 --> 00:51:31.159
As it says there in verse 12,

00:51:31.159 --> 00:51:35.159
well, we keep that day close in our mind.

00:51:35.159 --> 00:51:38.159
We never let it be out of our sight.

00:51:38.159 --> 00:51:40.159
As the footnote also says,

00:51:40.159 --> 00:51:43.159
we eagerly desire it.

00:51:43.159 --> 00:51:46.159
Well, now if we're persons like that,

00:51:46.159 --> 00:51:49.159
Peter says that we're going to be busy

00:51:49.159 --> 00:51:52.159
in deeds of God the devotion.

00:51:52.159 --> 00:51:54.159
Well, now just as a quick reminder,

00:51:54.159 --> 00:51:56.159
what is God the devotion?

00:51:56.159 --> 00:52:00.159
Well, just looking at our new world translation glossary,

00:52:00.159 --> 00:52:02.159
here's the definition.

00:52:02.159 --> 00:52:05.159
It's reverence, worship,

00:52:05.159 --> 00:52:11.159
and service to Jehovah God with loyalty to his universal sovereignty.

00:52:11.159 --> 00:52:14.159
Well, what do we get from that definition?

00:52:14.159 --> 00:52:18.159
You can notice reverence, worship, service.

00:52:18.159 --> 00:52:21.159
You see, godly devotion is not passive.

00:52:21.159 --> 00:52:23.159
It's active.

00:52:23.159 --> 00:52:27.159
It's reflected in action and inactivity.

00:52:27.159 --> 00:52:31.159
That's why the Apostle Peter used the expression in verse 11

00:52:31.159 --> 00:52:34.159
deeds of God the devotion.

00:52:34.159 --> 00:52:38.159
Well, what are some of the ways that we demonstrate this quality?

00:52:38.159 --> 00:52:40.159
Well, some of them are just very small.

00:52:40.159 --> 00:52:43.159
For example, what about hospitality?

00:52:43.159 --> 00:52:46.159
In 1 Peter, chapter 4,

00:52:46.159 --> 00:52:49.159
and verse 9, when the Apostle Peter wrote his first letter,

00:52:49.159 --> 00:52:54.159
he said, be hospitable to one another without grumbling.

00:52:55.159 --> 00:52:59.159
Well, there are so many opportunities for us to imitate Jehovah

00:52:59.159 --> 00:53:04.159
and be hospitable to share with others according to their needs.

00:53:04.159 --> 00:53:08.159
And this really is an expression not only for another person,

00:53:08.159 --> 00:53:11.159
but it's an expression of our love for Jehovah,

00:53:11.159 --> 00:53:14.159
our desire to want to imitate him.

00:53:14.159 --> 00:53:16.159
Well, we all acknowledge that.

00:53:16.159 --> 00:53:18.159
But here's the question.

00:53:18.159 --> 00:53:23.159
When was the last time that you acted hospitably

00:53:23.159 --> 00:53:26.159
or when was the last time I acted hospitably?

00:53:26.159 --> 00:53:30.159
You see, it's not enough just to love the quality of hospitality.

00:53:30.159 --> 00:53:33.159
If we're going to have deeds of God the devotion,

00:53:33.159 --> 00:53:35.159
we're going to have to practice it.

00:53:35.159 --> 00:53:37.159
Here's another one.

00:53:37.159 --> 00:53:41.159
What about helping the elderly that are in our midst?

00:53:41.159 --> 00:53:44.159
You know, our elderly brothers need help.

00:53:44.159 --> 00:53:46.159
They need help to get to the meetings.

00:53:46.159 --> 00:53:49.159
They need help to get out in the field ministry.

00:53:50.159 --> 00:53:52.159
Some of them are confined to their homes.

00:53:52.159 --> 00:53:57.159
Well, if that's the case, they may need help from younger ones

00:53:57.159 --> 00:54:00.159
to assist them with shopping or doing errands

00:54:00.159 --> 00:54:04.159
or just doing some chore around the house.

00:54:04.159 --> 00:54:07.159
Well, that's something that has been mentioned in many

00:54:07.159 --> 00:54:09.159
watched our articles.

00:54:09.159 --> 00:54:11.159
It's been mentioned at many conventions and assemblies.

00:54:11.159 --> 00:54:15.159
It's been mentioned at many congregation meetings.

00:54:15.159 --> 00:54:17.159
But now here's a question.

00:54:17.159 --> 00:54:20.159
When was the last time that you did something

00:54:20.159 --> 00:54:22.159
for an elderly brother or sister?

00:54:22.159 --> 00:54:24.159
Or when was the last time I did?

00:54:24.159 --> 00:54:29.159
You see, we need to think about not just loving these ideas,

00:54:29.159 --> 00:54:32.159
but what are we doing to really help?

00:54:32.159 --> 00:54:36.159
See, that's showing deeds of God the devotion.

00:54:36.159 --> 00:54:40.159
Well, of course, we also have to think about the more major things.

00:54:40.159 --> 00:54:44.159
What about attending our congregation meetings?

00:54:44.159 --> 00:54:47.159
Hebrews chapter 10 verses 23 to 25,

00:54:47.159 --> 00:54:50.159
that scripture that we quote so many times

00:54:50.159 --> 00:54:54.159
says that we should not forsake our meeting together.

00:54:54.159 --> 00:54:59.159
But it goes on to say that we should encourage one another.

00:54:59.159 --> 00:55:02.159
So it's not enough just to be at the meeting.

00:55:02.159 --> 00:55:04.159
When we're there, we want to reach out

00:55:04.159 --> 00:55:07.159
and do everything that we can to encourage our brothers

00:55:07.159 --> 00:55:10.159
and really participate in the meeting.

00:55:10.159 --> 00:55:15.159
You see, God the devotion is not passive, it's active.

00:55:15.159 --> 00:55:19.159
And so what sort of persons ought we to be when we're at the meeting?

00:55:19.159 --> 00:55:25.159
Well, we know we want to be active, fully involved with the program.

00:55:25.159 --> 00:55:28.159
But now, of course, what's the most important way

00:55:28.159 --> 00:55:31.159
that we exercise these deeds of God the devotion?

00:55:31.159 --> 00:55:34.159
Well, you'll remember that the Apostle Paul,

00:55:34.159 --> 00:55:37.159
in 1 Timothy chapter 3 and verse 16,

00:55:37.159 --> 00:55:42.159
referred to the sacred secret of God the devotion.

00:55:42.159 --> 00:55:46.159
And he showed there that Jesus really was that secret.

00:55:46.159 --> 00:55:50.159
You see, he was the one who demonstrated God the devotion

00:55:50.159 --> 00:55:53.159
in a perfect sense.

00:55:53.159 --> 00:55:56.159
Now, Paul in that verse, 1 Timothy 3, 16,

00:55:56.159 --> 00:56:01.159
went on to say that Jesus was preached among the nations.

00:56:01.159 --> 00:56:05.159
Well, then that really is a vital part of our deeds

00:56:05.159 --> 00:56:07.159
of God the devotion.

00:56:07.159 --> 00:56:10.159
Preaching about Christ Jesus, His kingdom,

00:56:10.159 --> 00:56:13.159
and everything that will be accomplished.

00:56:13.159 --> 00:56:17.159
But brothers, how much incentive we have today

00:56:17.159 --> 00:56:20.159
to be involved fully in our preaching work?

00:56:20.159 --> 00:56:25.159
We have tools today like we have never had before.

00:56:25.159 --> 00:56:28.159
You know, over the summer, as I was attending a number of different

00:56:28.159 --> 00:56:31.159
regional conventions and different parts of the world,

00:56:31.159 --> 00:56:35.159
I enjoyed so much, no doubt just as you have,

00:56:35.159 --> 00:56:39.159
using the JW Library app.

00:56:39.159 --> 00:56:42.159
And downloading the Why Study the Bible video

00:56:42.159 --> 00:56:45.159
in a number of different languages.

00:56:45.159 --> 00:56:48.159
We had one really interesting experience when we were in Europe.

00:56:48.159 --> 00:56:52.159
We got into a taxi with a driver from Africa.

00:56:52.159 --> 00:56:55.159
And right away, we asked him what his language was.

00:56:55.159 --> 00:56:59.159
Well, he told us it was a language not familiar to us at all.

00:56:59.159 --> 00:57:05.159
But while he was driving, we managed to download the Why Study the Bible video.

00:57:05.159 --> 00:57:09.159
And it automatically began to play as we were in the car.

00:57:09.159 --> 00:57:12.159
Well, as soon as the man heard it, he started shouting,

00:57:12.159 --> 00:57:14.159
what's happening? What's happening?

00:57:14.159 --> 00:57:17.159
I think he thought he was hearing a voice from heaven

00:57:17.159 --> 00:57:20.159
when he heard his own language in the taxi.

00:57:20.159 --> 00:57:23.159
But we reassured him that that was not the case.

00:57:23.159 --> 00:57:25.159
But he was so moved.

00:57:25.159 --> 00:57:29.159
He almost didn't want to take the fare, if you can imagine.

00:57:29.159 --> 00:57:33.159
And initially, he had been quite unfriendly.

00:57:33.159 --> 00:57:36.159
But when he saw what was available on our website,

00:57:36.159 --> 00:57:38.159
he was deeply moved.

00:57:38.159 --> 00:57:41.159
Well, maybe you've had a similar experience.

00:57:41.159 --> 00:57:43.159
Just as a note of future reference,

00:57:43.159 --> 00:57:48.159
probably not a good idea to play the video when someone's driving.

00:57:48.159 --> 00:57:52.159
Well, if we have real godly devotion that's active,

00:57:52.159 --> 00:57:57.159
we're going to be busy in doing deeds of godly devotion.

00:57:57.159 --> 00:57:59.159
You know, there's an old saying that says,

00:57:59.159 --> 00:58:02.159
time flies when you're having fun.

00:58:02.159 --> 00:58:07.159
Well, you know, even scientists acknowledge that there's truth in that.

00:58:07.159 --> 00:58:11.159
A study that was published in the year 2012 in the journal

00:58:11.159 --> 00:58:15.159
Psychological Science said this.

00:58:15.159 --> 00:58:20.159
Although we tend to believe that time flies when we're having a good time,

00:58:20.159 --> 00:58:25.159
these studies indicate that what it is about the enjoyable time

00:58:25.159 --> 00:58:28.159
that causes it to go by more quickly.

00:58:28.159 --> 00:58:33.159
It seems to be the goal pursuit or achievement-directed action

00:58:33.159 --> 00:58:36.159
we're engaged in that matters.

00:58:36.159 --> 00:58:41.159
Just being content or satisfied may not make time fly.

00:58:41.159 --> 00:58:47.159
But being excited or actively pursuing a desired object can.

00:58:47.159 --> 00:58:49.159
Isn't that interesting?

00:58:49.159 --> 00:58:54.159
If we're the sort of persons that are busy with holy acts of conduct

00:58:54.159 --> 00:58:59.159
and deeds of godly devotion reaching out for that most important goal

00:58:59.159 --> 00:59:05.159
of everlasting life, we will speed up the coming of the day of Jehovah

00:59:05.159 --> 00:59:08.159
in our hearts and our minds.

00:59:08.159 --> 00:59:13.159
What deeds of godly devotion do you remember from that fine presentation?

00:59:13.159 --> 00:59:18.159
Among other things, Brother Sanderson explained that one deed of godly devotion

00:59:18.159 --> 00:59:21.159
may be hospitable to one another.

00:59:21.159 --> 00:59:25.159
Well, hospitality is also the theme of this month's music video,

00:59:25.159 --> 00:59:50.500
which is entitled, Follow the Course.

00:59:50.500 --> 01:00:05.860
Just talking Jehovah, you put it on a tape

01:00:05.860 --> 01:02:36.500
so could we be...

01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:37.500
What a nice song.

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:41.500
And while that music video brings this program to its conclusion,

01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:45.500
we'd like to encourage you to watch a video that will be posted later this month

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:48.500
about Sister Cindy Macintosh.

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:53.500
She was in the military for many years and described herself as having become a dark

01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:55.500
and uncaring person.

01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:59.500
But then, Jehovah taught her what true love means.

01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:02.500
The video is entitled, I put down my rifle,

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:07.500
and is available on video on demand in the interviews and experiences category.

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:12.500
Yes, love truly is the identifying mark of true Christian.

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:16.500
That's what stands out when you visit other congregations,

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:18.500
perhaps when traveling.

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:21.500
One good example is the Nung Hai congregation

01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:24.500
in the north-eastern corner of Thailand.

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:27.500
The 32 publishers send their love.

01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:30.500
There's a great need in Thailand,

01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:33.500
which is why half of the 10 appointed brothers

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:39.500
in the congregation and half of the 18 pioneers are need-graders.

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:43.500
Witnessing carts have been set up at a nearby border crossing

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:46.500
with 10 languages regularly featured.

01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:51.500
Many copies are placed with visitors from countries where our work is restricted.

01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:56.500
Sometimes, over 1,000 pieces of literature are placed in a single day at the border crossing.

01:03:56.500 --> 01:04:01.500
The Nung Hai congregation had the privilege of being a host congregation

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:06.500
when a special convention was arranged in October of last year.

01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:10.500
And during the convention, they were surprised and overjoyed to hear

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:17.500
that the new world translation was now available in the Thai language.

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:21.500
We pray that Jehovah continue to bless the brothers and sisters in Thailand

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:23.500
and all of you around the world.

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:25.500
We love you very much.

01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:30.500
This is JW Broadcasting from Brooklyn, New York.
