00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.559
There's an ongoing need for volunteers at Bethel and on theocratic construction projects.

00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:23.359
Are you interested in serving in these ways?

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.800
If so, we encourage you to watch the video,

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.559
making yourself available for Bethel's service,

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:33.280
which can be found on JW.org.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.799
In addition, pioneers between the ages of 23 and 65

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:41.479
who are interested in expanding their ministry,

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.399
are invited to contact their congregation secretary

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:50.200
and fill in the online application to attend the school for kingdom evangelizers.

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:57.899
How can we maintain our faith during these difficult last days of this system of things?

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:03.259
We learn many lessons from a time remarkably similar to ours.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.939
Please follow along in your Bible as brother Anthony Morris of the governing body,

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.659
introduces and applies the dramatic Bible reading entitled,

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:17.900
Noah, faith moved him to obey.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.379
Three days before Jesus was put to death,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.780
his disciples posed a question that has great importance for all of us today.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.260
They asked Jesus,

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:42.340
what will be the sign of your presence and of the conclusion of the system of things?

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:50.260
In reply, Jesus foretolded a time period preceding the promised new world would be marked by events,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:56.340
such as wars, earthquakes, food shortages, and pestilence.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.900
Jesus then said,

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.060
for as they were in those days before the flood,

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.099
eating and drinking, men marrying, and women being given a marriage,

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:15.780
until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and they took no note until the flood came

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.460
and swept them all away, so the presence of the Son of Man will be.

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:31.300
With those words, Jesus confirmed that Noah was a real person and that the flood was an actual

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.860
historical event. He also warned us that the period just before the flood

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:46.340
mirrors the period in which we live today, so it's important to consider closely what happened

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:53.860
in Noah's day and to see what we can learn from it. The opening chapters of the book of Genesis

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.180
give us a picture of what life was like in the centuries prior to Noah

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:07.539
after Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden. Everyone spoke the same language.

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:11.620
And people had possibly developed the art of writing.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:18.979
They had built a city, maybe several cities. They had learned how to forge copper and iron.

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:27.780
They made musical instruments, harps and flutes. And because they were much closer to the physical

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:34.180
perfection of Adam and Eve, they lived long lives, hundreds of years.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:45.699
But, all was not well. People turned away from Jehovah, and as a result, they became very violent

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:53.460
and immoral. Things got so bad that Jehovah moved a righteous man named Enoch, the seventh man,

00:03:53.460 --> 00:04:01.300
and the genealogical line from Adam to prophesy that God would not forever tolerate a wicked and

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:09.379
rebellious world. He'd execute judgment against the ungodly. Of course, the ungodly people in

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:16.259
Enoch's day didn't like what he was saying. They hated Enoch, and they may have tried to kill him.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:25.779
Enoch never saw the fulfillment of this prophecy. Another 600 years passed, and by then,

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:36.250
conditions on earth had become even worse. Let's read Genesis chapter 6, verses 1 through 7.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.959
Now when men started to grow a number on the surface of the ground, and daughters were born to them,

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:51.319
the sons of the true God began to notice that the daughters of men were beautiful.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.000
So they began taking as wives all whom they chose. Then Jehovah said,

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:05.639
My spirit will not tolerate men indefinitely, because he is only flesh. Accordingly, his days will

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:13.800
amount to 120 years. The Nephilim were on the earth in those days and afterward. During that time,

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.240
the sons of the true God continued to have relations with the daughters of men, and these

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:27.560
bore sons to them. They were the mighty ones of old times, the men of fame. Consequently,

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:33.879
Jehovah saw that man's wickedness was great on the earth, and that every inclination of the

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:41.399
thoughts of his heart was only bad all the time. Jehovah regretted that he had made men on the earth,

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:49.079
in his heart was saddened. So Jehovah said, I am going to wipe men whom I have created off the

00:05:49.079 --> 00:05:56.600
surface of the ground, man together with domestic animals, creeping animals, and flying creatures

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:06.740
of the heavens, where I regret that I have made them. During that time, some angels from heaven

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:15.699
noticed beautiful human women and developed lustful feelings for them. These angels rebelled against

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:24.899
God by coming to earth and taking on human bodies in order to have sex with the women. They became

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:33.860
selfish and wicked demons. They may have been charming, intelligent, handsome, and they had supernatural

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:42.740
powers. They must have been irresistible, especially to women who themselves had no love of God.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:51.779
Perhaps the angels took some women by force, whatever the case, the angels took all whom they chose.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:07:01.939
What human on earth at that time could hope to stop demons? To these godless creatures people

00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:12.470
lost their daughters, their sisters, and possibly even their wives. The women became pregnant

00:07:13.269 --> 00:07:19.910
and gave birth to sons, but their sons were not like other boys. They were stronger,

00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:29.110
they were bullies, aggressive, fierce, and brutal. Those qualities stayed with them as they grew.

00:07:30.069 --> 00:07:36.949
The boys became men, but they were unusually cruel. They were called Nephilim,

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:46.230
possibly meaning those who caused others to fall down and people feared them. Like their fathers,

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:55.189
the Nephilim had no love for God, and they cared only about their fame for being strong and vicious.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:08:05.750
The materialized angels in their savage offspring dominated the world of that time and people followed

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:14.920
their lead. Jehovah saw that man's wickedness was rampant and that every inclination of the thoughts of

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:25.399
his heart was only bad all the time. How Satan must have delighted to see most humans reject Jehovah,

00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:37.720
and become more and more corrupt. And that world of depraved people there was a man who was faithful

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:50.490
to Jehovah. Let's read about him in Genesis chapter 6 and verse 8. But Noah found favor in the eyes

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:58.330
of Jehovah. This is the history of Noah. Noah was a righteous man. He proved himself faultless

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:06.330
among his contemporaries. Noah walked with the true God. In time Noah became father to three

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:14.570
sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. But the earth had become ruined in the sight of the true God,

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:21.929
and the earth was filled with violence. Yes, God looked upon the earth and it was ruined.

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:31.450
All flesh had ruined its way on the earth. Some people today say that there was no such person

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:38.169
as Noah, and that the account of the ark and the flood is just a legend or a fairy tale.

00:09:39.129 --> 00:09:46.009
But the Bible writer knew that Noah really existed and that the flood truly happened.

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:54.169
The prophet Isaiah and Ezekiel both referred to Noah. Ezra, the writer of first chronicles in

00:09:54.169 --> 00:10:02.250
the gospel writer Luke, both include Noah and the chronologies they compiled. The apostles Peter

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:10.730
and Paul both confirmed the Genesis account of the flood. And as we mentioned earlier, the son of God

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:19.049
himself testified that Noah was a real person and that the flood really happened.

00:10:21.639 --> 00:10:28.440
Noah's faith was outstanding. He lived in an evil world, a world dominated,

00:10:29.159 --> 00:10:34.759
a terrorized angels there, violent offspring, and a society of ungodly people.

00:10:36.519 --> 00:10:41.399
Noah lacked many of the things we have today to help us keep our faith strong.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:49.080
He had no Bible to help him to love Jehovah and to understand his ways. He didn't know about all

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:57.240
the faithful men and women who would live after him. And Noah had no congregation of fellow believers

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:07.750
to encourage him and to strengthen his faith. Yet Noah knew much. He knew what happened in the

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:14.870
Garden of Eden. And he could see the tragic results. He saw that people grew old and died.

00:11:16.149 --> 00:11:22.149
He knew that the way to the Garden of Eden was barred and the ground outside had been cursed.

00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:27.590
He understood what his great grandfather, Enoch, had foretold.

00:11:29.029 --> 00:11:35.350
And Noah knew that his father, Lamek, had given him a name, likely meaning rest or consolation,

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:42.629
because he would, as his father foretold, bring us comfort from our labor and from the painful

00:11:42.629 --> 00:11:53.049
toil of our hands because of the ground that Jehovah has cursed. Surely Noah wondered about these

00:11:53.049 --> 00:12:00.649
prophecies. How would he bring comfort? How and when would God act against the wicked ones

00:12:01.289 --> 00:12:11.129
who surrounded him? For hundreds of years Noah prayed and he wondered. By the time he had lived well

00:12:11.129 --> 00:12:21.450
over 500 years, he had married and had a family, three sons. Though he lived in a wicked world,

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:26.649
Noah remained faithful to God and he helped his family to do the same.

00:12:26.649 --> 00:12:36.009
Then Jehovah delivered a message that surely must have stunned Noah. Let's continue reading from

00:12:36.009 --> 00:12:45.379
Genesis 6, verse 13. After that, God said to Noah,

00:12:45.379 --> 00:12:54.919
I have decided to put an end to all flesh because the earth is full of violence on account of them.

00:12:55.879 --> 00:13:02.919
So I am bringing them to ruin together with the earth. Make for yourself an ark from

00:13:02.919 --> 00:13:10.759
resinous wood. You will make compartments in the ark and cover it with tar inside and outside.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:20.840
This is how you will make it. The ark should be 300 qubits long, 50 qubits wide, and 30 qubits high.

00:13:21.559 --> 00:13:29.240
You will make a window for light for the ark. One qubit from the top. You should put the entrance

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:35.559
of the ark in its side and make it with a lower deck, a second deck, and a third deck.

00:13:36.679 --> 00:13:43.639
As for me, I am going to bring flood waters upon the earth to destroy from under the heavens

00:13:43.639 --> 00:13:49.320
all flesh that has the breath of life. Everything on the earth will perish.

00:13:50.519 --> 00:13:57.879
And I am establishing my covenant with you, and you must go into the ark. You, your sons,

00:13:57.879 --> 00:14:04.919
your wife, and your sons' wives with you, and bring into the ark two of every sort of living

00:14:04.919 --> 00:14:12.200
creature in order to preserve them alive with you, a male and a female of the flying creatures

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:18.759
according to their kinds, the domestic animals according to their kinds, and all creeping

00:14:18.759 --> 00:14:25.879
animals of the ground according to their kinds. Two of each will go in there to you to preserve

00:14:25.879 --> 00:14:32.919
them alive. For your part, you are to collect and take with you every kind of food to eat,

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:43.879
to serve as food for you and for the animals. And Noah did according to all that God had commanded

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:54.120
him. He did just so. Noah had long wondered how Jehovah would act against an ungodly world.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.960
Now he knew a catastrophic flood would cleanse the earth.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:08.279
Noah also knew what he and his family must do. So much dependent on him.

00:15:08.919 --> 00:15:20.200
The thought must have been overwhelming. The ark would be gigantic. Now new questions occupied

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:28.759
his mind. Trees. A great many trees would have to be filled in the timber, halls, shaped, and joined.

00:15:29.639 --> 00:15:37.559
How would he do that? How would he gather so many kinds of animals? How would he get food supplies

00:15:37.559 --> 00:15:45.000
for the animals and for his family? And what about the godless people around him?

00:15:45.879 --> 00:15:53.350
What would they think? No one knew what had happened to the righteous men who proceeded him.

00:15:54.549 --> 00:16:01.590
Abel had been killed by his brother, King. And Enoch likely was in such danger of being slain by

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:08.230
ungodly ones that God mercifully cut his life short so they wouldn't fall into their hands.

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:15.269
People would see what he was doing. And they'd soon learn why he was doing it.

00:16:16.789 --> 00:16:21.269
These god-designing Nephilim influence people might react violently.

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:31.269
Yet Noah trusted in Jehovah and he got to work. He did all of that. God had commanded him.

00:16:32.309 --> 00:16:38.470
It took a long time for Noah's family to build the ark. Perhaps some 40 or 50 years.

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:44.230
There must have been challenges, but we never read that Noah complained.

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:52.309
The family had no support from others. Remember that Jesus said that the people took no note

00:16:52.950 --> 00:17:00.230
until the flood came and swept them all away. Of course people took note that Noah was building an

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:06.950
ark. His neighbors must have asked him why he was building such an enormous structure.

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:14.549
And Noah explained to them why he was building it. But Noah's contemporaries took no note

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:23.029
that Jehovah was blessing Noah and his construction efforts. They took no note of what this would

00:17:23.029 --> 00:17:28.230
mean for them. Instead the people were caught up in everyday affairs,

00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:34.150
eating, drinking, and marrying. Those were the things that concerned them.

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:39.750
To those godless people knowing his family were fools, crackpots.

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:50.180
They were the butt of ridicule, jeers, and probably threats. The ark was finally complete.

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:58.900
We can imagine Noah and his family looking at it with pride. And remembering how God had helped him.

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:07.700
Jehovah always directs his servants when needed. Now Jehovah spoke again to Noah.

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:12.980
Let's read chapter 7 starting with verse 1.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:16.660
After that, Jehovah said to Noah,

00:18:42.980 --> 00:19:05.619
Then Noah did everything that Jehovah had commanded him.

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:21.700
The reigns would come. Animals, many animals had to be situated in the ark. Supplies had to be

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:28.900
secured. Noah listened and he obeyed. For the second time in this inspired account,

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:37.619
we are told that Noah did all that he was commanded to do. Now please turn to Genesis chapter 7

00:19:38.579 --> 00:19:45.779
and verse 6. Noah was 600 years old when the floodwaters came upon the earth.

00:19:46.819 --> 00:19:54.420
So Noah, along with his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives, went into the ark ahead of the floodwaters.

00:19:55.940 --> 00:20:02.740
Of every clean animal, and of every animal that is not clean, and of the flying creatures,

00:20:02.819 --> 00:20:09.059
and of everything that moves on the ground, they went inside the ark to Noah by

00:20:09.059 --> 00:20:19.380
twos, male and female, just as God had commanded Noah. And seven days later, the floodwaters came

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:28.420
upon the earth. In the 600th year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the 17th day of the month,

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:36.420
on that day, all the springs of the vast watery, deep, burst open, and the floodgates of the heavens

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:45.059
were open. And the reign poured down on the earth for forty days and forty nights. On that very day,

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:53.059
Noah went into the ark, along with his sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and his wife, and the

00:20:53.299 --> 00:21:01.539
three wives of his sons. They went in with every wild animal according to its kind, and every domestic

00:21:01.539 --> 00:21:08.819
animal according to its kind, and every creeping animal of the earth according to its kind, and every

00:21:08.819 --> 00:21:16.180
flying creature according to its kind, every bird, every winged creature. They kept going to

00:21:16.259 --> 00:21:23.059
Noah inside the ark, two by two, of every sort of flesh that has the breath of life.

00:21:24.099 --> 00:21:30.420
So they went in, male and female, of every sort of flesh, just as God had commanded him.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:39.220
After that, Jehovah shut the door behind him. The flooding continued for forty days on the earth,

00:21:39.859 --> 00:21:47.220
and the waters kept increasing and began carrying the ark, and it was floating high above the earth.

00:21:48.579 --> 00:21:53.539
The waters became overwhelming, and kept increasing greatly upon the earth,

00:21:54.339 --> 00:22:02.339
but the ark floated on the surface of the waters. The waters overwhelmed the earth so greatly

00:22:02.339 --> 00:22:09.380
that all the tall mountains under the whole heavens were covered. The waters rose up to

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:16.500
fifteen cubits above the mountains. So all living creatures that were moving on the earth

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:23.779
perished, the flying creatures, the domestic animals, the wild animals, the swarming creatures,

00:22:23.779 --> 00:22:32.019
and all mankind. Everything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils died.

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:40.099
So he wiped every living thing from the surface of the earth, including man, animals,

00:22:40.099 --> 00:22:46.579
creeping animals, and the flying creatures of the sky. They were all wiped off the earth,

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:54.420
only Noah and those with him in the ark survived. And the waters continued

00:22:54.579 --> 00:23:04.410
overwhelming the earth for 150 days. If Noah had wondered how he would collect all those animals,

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:13.289
he now knew. They would come to him. Jehovah would bring them. Noah didn't have to go looking

00:23:13.289 --> 00:23:21.529
for them. The animals did come every kind of animal, some by sevens, and some by twos.

00:23:21.769 --> 00:23:32.170
Just imagine dozens and dozens of animals strutting, popping, slithering, and waddling into the

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:39.930
earth. We can imagine Noah's family finding places for them all, stroking the soft fur of some

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:46.890
animals as they pass, while avoiding the rough hides or spines of others and making sure to get out

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:55.130
of the way of the large animals as they lumbered past. The birds came too, fluttering,

00:23:55.130 --> 00:24:04.170
snoring, what colors, what smells, what sounds. Noah's family must have shouted to hear one

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:11.819
another above the den. When all were inside, Jehovah shut the door.

00:24:12.619 --> 00:24:20.380
Can you picture the family huddling together inside the ark, listening, straining to hear,

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:31.019
then it came rain. Perhaps it began almost imperceptibly, but soon it came in torrents.

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:39.819
The sound was deafening. What they had long anticipated was now happening. They were tired,

00:24:40.779 --> 00:24:49.180
exhausted, but there was likely little sleep that night. There were animals to check.

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:59.160
There was the din of the rain and how they prayed. Did their thoughts turn to those outside?

00:25:00.119 --> 00:25:06.759
Certainly. They knew those people and had preached to them. Many were relatives.

00:25:07.559 --> 00:25:16.759
How sad for them. Like Jehovah, Noah took no delight in the death of the wicked.

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:25.559
It saddened him that so many had to die, but he knew that those who perished at ample warning of

00:25:25.559 --> 00:25:33.480
what was to come. Even if they hadn't seen the ark Noah was building, they would have heard about

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:42.759
it. They'd know why he was building it. Now it was too late for them. Jehovah had shut the door.

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:49.980
Noah's family listened as the rain battered the ark without letting them.

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:59.619
And then came a moment they would never forget. Movement. They felt their massive

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:07.619
wooden ark lifting from the ground. It was floating. Their hearts were beating loud and fast.

00:26:08.819 --> 00:26:17.700
Would their vessel hold together? Let's resume our reading from Genesis chapter 8, verse 1,

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:26.900
to see what happened next. But God gave attention to Noah and to all the wild animals and domestic

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:33.140
animals that were with him in the ark. And God caused a wind to blow over the earth,

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:40.259
and the waters began to subside. The springs of the watery deep and the flood gates of the heavens

00:26:40.259 --> 00:26:47.460
were stopped up, so the rain from the heavens stopped falling. Then the waters began to

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:54.900
receive progressively from the earth. By the end of 150 days, the waters had subsided.

00:26:55.859 --> 00:27:02.900
In the seventh month, on the 17th day of the month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:10.500
Ararat, and the waters were steadily decreasing until the 10th month. In the 10th month,

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:17.299
on the 1st of the month, the tops of the mountains appeared. So at the end of 40 days,

00:27:17.859 --> 00:27:24.819
Noah opened the window that he had made in the ark and sent out a raven. It continued flying

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:33.059
outside and returning until the waters dried off the earth. Later, he sent out a dove to see

00:27:33.059 --> 00:27:38.980
whether the waters had receded from the surface of the ground. The dove did not find any resting

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:44.980
place to perch, so it returned to him into the ark, because the waters were still covering the

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:51.220
surface of the whole earth. So he reached his hand out and brought it inside the ark.

00:27:51.539 --> 00:27:57.700
He waited seven more days, and once again, he sent out the dove from the ark.

00:27:58.819 --> 00:28:04.980
When the dove came to him toward evening, he saw that there was a freshly plucked olive leaf in

00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:13.220
its bill, so Noah knew that the waters had receded from the earth. He waited still another seven

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:20.420
days, then he sent out the dove, but it did not return to him any more.

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:29.299
For 40 days and 40 nights, the noise of torrential rain filled the ark, and then it stopped.

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:37.059
Imagine Noah and his family peering out of the ark and seeing nothing but water, no land anywhere.

00:28:38.019 --> 00:28:49.460
It went blue, and the waters subsided. Finally, 150 days after the downpour began, the ark settled on land.

00:28:50.660 --> 00:29:01.700
What a happy day that must have been. Was it safe to go out? No. The waters had to subside further.

00:29:02.259 --> 00:29:09.460
There was plenty to do to keep the family busy. There were animals to feed and to care for them.

00:29:10.339 --> 00:29:16.259
Still Noah's family must have longed to be outside, to be free of the confinement,

00:29:16.819 --> 00:29:21.539
to feel the ground under their feet. Patience was needed.

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:28.500
Picture the family spending time together, planning what they do when they came out of the ark.

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:40.309
Another 73 days passed. Now they could see the tops of the mountains. Now was it safe to exit?

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:49.509
Noah peered out of a window. He selected from the birds a raven, and he sent it out, but it kept returning.

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:58.150
Noah put the raven back in its place and selected a dove. It too flew and returned, not having found a

00:29:58.150 --> 00:30:06.069
place to perch. A week later, he released it again, and it returned with an olive leaf in its bill.

00:30:07.589 --> 00:30:16.230
Seven days later, Noah sent it again. This time, it did not return. What next?

00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:22.630
Let's continue reading from chapter 8, verse 13.

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:31.990
Now in the 600 first year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the waters had

00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:38.710
drained from the earth, and Noah removed the covering of the ark and saw that the surface of the

00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:45.910
ground was drying. In the second month, on the 27th day of the month, the earth had dried off.

00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:48.309
God now said to Noah,

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:57.190
Go out of the ark, you, your wife, your sons, and your sons' wives. Bring out with you all the

00:30:57.190 --> 00:31:03.190
living creatures of every sort of flesh, of the flying creatures, and of the animals, and of all the

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:09.269
creeping animals of the earth, that they may multiply on the earth and be fruitful and become

00:31:09.349 --> 00:31:16.950
many on the earth. So Noah went out, together with his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives.

00:31:18.069 --> 00:31:23.750
Every living creature, every creeping animal, and every flying creature,

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:30.950
everything that moves on the earth went out of the ark by families. Then Noah built an alter

00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:37.029
to Jehovah, and took some of all the clean animals, and of all the clean flying creatures,

00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:44.150
and offered burnt offerings on the altar. And Jehovah began to smell a pleasing aroma,

00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:46.470
so Jehovah said in his heart,

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:54.869
Never again will I curse the ground on man's account, for the inclination of the heart of man

00:31:54.869 --> 00:32:01.750
is bad, from his youth up, and never again will I strike down every living thing as I have done.

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:08.150
From now on, the earth will never cease to have seeds showing and harvest,

00:32:08.869 --> 00:32:19.210
coal and heat, summer and winter and day and night. When the dove didn't return,

00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:27.210
Noah removed part of the roof of the ark. Now he could see that much of the land had dried out.

00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:34.170
Possibly he could see vegetation growing and flourishing in a way that it hadn't been

00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:37.450
possible in the days before the flood when the earth had been cursed.

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:42.250
Still Noah waited for Jehovah's direction.

00:32:44.329 --> 00:32:51.369
And then it came. Jehovah's command, go out of the ark, at last,

00:32:53.779 --> 00:33:00.339
what a joyful day that must have been. They'd been in the ark for 370 days.

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:07.619
Picture the family coming out of the ark, laughing, breathing fresh air,

00:33:07.619 --> 00:33:16.579
eager to adjust to their new life. The annals came out too, and the family watched as they dispersed

00:33:16.579 --> 00:33:24.740
in all directions. Some they'd drawn close to, but now it was farewell, a happy farewell.

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:36.089
There were no materialized angels, no Nephilim, and no wicked people. How grateful they were to

00:33:36.089 --> 00:33:46.650
Jehovah. Noah wasted no time. He built an altar and sacrificed to Jehovah, and God expressed his

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:55.289
pleasure. Jehovah assured the family that he would never again strike down every living thing.

00:33:56.890 --> 00:34:03.049
But he did more than that. He concluded a covenant with Noah and his sons,

00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:12.650
and gave them a sign that we too can observe. Let's read about it at Genesis chapter 9, starting

00:34:13.449 --> 00:34:18.969
with verse 8. Then God said to Noah, until his sons with him,

00:34:19.449 --> 00:34:27.690
I am now establishing my covenant with you, and with your offspring after you, and with every living

00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:34.250
creature that is with you, the birds, the animals, and all the living creatures of the earth with you,

00:34:34.969 --> 00:34:42.809
all those that came out of the ark, every living creature of the earth. Yes, I establish my covenant

00:34:42.809 --> 00:34:50.170
with you. Never again will all flesh be destroyed by the waters of a flood, and never again

00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:57.369
will a flood bring the earth to ruin. And God added, this is the sign of the covenant that I am

00:34:57.369 --> 00:35:04.409
making between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations.

00:35:05.449 --> 00:35:12.489
I put my rainbow in the cloud, and it will serve as a sign of the covenant between me

00:35:12.489 --> 00:35:19.210
and the earth. Whenever I bring a cloud over the earth, then the rainbow will certainly appear in

00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:27.050
the cloud, and I will certainly remember my covenant that I made between me and you and every

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:34.570
living creature of every kind, and never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all flesh,

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:41.690
and the rainbow will occur in the cloud, and I will certainly see it, and remember the ever

00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:47.769
lasting covenant between God and every living creature of every kind on the earth.

00:35:50.139 --> 00:35:59.900
What a magnificent sign Jehovah gave. Every rainbow would remind both God and man of his promise.

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:07.099
How Noah's family must have marveled to see the colors spanning across the sky,

00:36:08.059 --> 00:36:20.099
violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red, never again will a flood deluge the earth.

00:36:21.699 --> 00:36:25.699
But Jehovah is not one to tolerate wickedness forever.

00:36:27.219 --> 00:36:35.219
Let's read what the Apostle Peter wrote. Please turn to second Peter, chapter 2 and verse 5.

00:36:36.179 --> 00:36:44.739
The Apostle wrote, and he, God, did not reframe from punishing an ancient world, but kept Noah,

00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:51.619
a preacher of righteousness, safe with seven others when he brought a flood upon a world of

00:36:51.619 --> 00:37:00.809
ungodly people. Today, we live in a world that resembles the one before the flood.

00:37:01.769 --> 00:37:07.530
There's violence, and people do all sorts of things that Jehovah hates.

00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:16.489
People are concerned with the everyday affairs of life and take no note of the message of salvation

00:37:17.369 --> 00:37:18.489
that we proclaim.

00:37:20.489 --> 00:37:26.730
Ridiculars of God's people mockingly say, where is this promise presence of his?

00:37:27.369 --> 00:37:32.969
Why all things are continuing exactly as they were from creations beginning?

00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:36.329
They are wrong.

00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:43.289
Jehovah acted against wickedness in the time of Noah and healed act again.

00:37:44.889 --> 00:37:48.329
But like Noah, the faithful will be saved.

00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:51.369
God's word assures us.

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:58.170
Jehovah knows how to rescue people of godly devotion out of trial,

00:37:58.969 --> 00:38:04.409
but to reserve on righteous people to be destroyed on the day of judgment.

00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:12.139
Jehovah will make the earth a paradise, just as he originally purposed.

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:16.139
The paradise will be inhabited by good people.

00:38:17.099 --> 00:38:20.059
There will be no people who rebel against God.

00:38:21.099 --> 00:38:23.420
And what are the rebellious spirit creatures?

00:38:25.019 --> 00:38:30.940
When the flood delus the earth and Noah's day, the rebellious angels left their human bodies

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:34.460
and returned to the spirit realm and disgrace.

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:43.019
However, these demons have continued to exert an evil influence on humans down to this day.

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:52.460
But when Jehovah acts again, the demons and their ruler Satan will be put out of action.

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:57.269
The word of God says this.

00:38:57.269 --> 00:39:03.909
By faith, Noah, after receiving divine warning of things not yet seen,

00:39:03.909 --> 00:39:09.750
showed godly fear and constructed an ark for the saving of his household.

00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:13.989
Faith moved Noah to obey Jehovah.

00:39:14.949 --> 00:39:18.550
As a result, he and his family survived the flood.

00:39:19.909 --> 00:39:24.230
Noah lived a long life, some 950 years.

00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:32.469
When that faithful man has resurrected, he'll have the prospect of living forever.

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:41.880
If we display the faith of Noah and obey Jehovah, we too can walk with Jehovah as our friend

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:46.440
and that friendship can last forever.

00:39:49.989 --> 00:39:55.269
The Bible account of Noah reminds us how close we are to the end of this system and

00:39:55.989 --> 00:39:58.389
how soon Jehovah will reward our faith.

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:03.429
You will be pleased to know that the dramatic Bible reading that you just enjoyed

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:10.309
is available for download today from JW.org and in the JW Library app.

00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:17.269
And just as Jehovah safeguarded Noah and his family in the days before the flood,

00:40:17.909 --> 00:40:19.670
he is now safeguarding us.

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:26.070
What can help us stay close to Jehovah despite any trials we face?

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:30.070
In what ways does he come to our aid?

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:36.469
Please pay close attention to brother Kenneth Cook of the governing body as he answers these

00:40:36.469 --> 00:40:42.630
questions in the talk. Have faith and do not doubt.

00:40:49.909 --> 00:40:55.429
We depend on many powerful man-made things to deliver the items that we need.

00:40:55.429 --> 00:41:01.429
For example, a powerful freight train can climb steep hills and deliver its freight on time.

00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:06.789
A powerful cargo ship can withstand high seas and deliver its cargo.

00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:10.869
But there is a limit to what man's ingenuity can do.

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:17.909
When it comes to our most crucial needs, such as true peace, real security, and lasting happiness,

00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:22.630
humans promise what they do not have the power to deliver.

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:28.869
Political, religious, and financial institutions have proved to be untrustworthy.

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:36.469
With so many promises broken, we're not surprised that many people are skeptical about the future.

00:41:37.429 --> 00:41:44.869
But in contrast to such failures, Jehovah's promises never fail, and we are made more powerful

00:41:44.869 --> 00:41:50.710
when we trust in his promises. He always delivers on his word.

00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:57.269
Jehovah promises to sustain us through any trials, no matter how intense they may become.

00:41:58.469 --> 00:42:04.789
Consider Jesus example. No human has faced trials more intense than what he experienced,

00:42:05.429 --> 00:42:10.630
yet Jesus had faith that delivered, powerful faith that carried him through.

00:42:11.429 --> 00:42:16.869
With freeness of speech, Jesus encouraged his followers to have faith and not to doubt.

00:42:17.909 --> 00:42:23.190
For example, on one occasion while traveling near Bethany with his disciples,

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:29.590
Jesus used a fig tree to provide an object lesson on the need to have faith in God.

00:42:30.389 --> 00:42:36.789
The account in Matthew chapter 21 tells us that the fig tree was barren, except for leaves.

00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:40.469
In verses 19 and 20, Jesus said to the tree,

00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:47.829
let no fruit come from you ever again, and the fig tree withered instantly.

00:42:48.469 --> 00:42:52.710
Now as a result, the disciples were amazed, and they asked Jesus,

00:42:53.269 --> 00:42:55.909
how is it that the fig tree withered instantly?

00:42:56.869 --> 00:43:01.190
As we read Jesus reply to them in verses 21 and 22,

00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:08.460
please keep in mind that Jesus is providing an object lesson for them.

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:14.619
So let's pull out the lesson about faith as we read verses 21 and 22.

00:43:15.739 --> 00:43:17.500
And answer Jesus said to them,

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:23.820
truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only will you do what I did to the

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:30.219
fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, be lifted up and thrown into the sea,

00:43:30.219 --> 00:43:36.380
it will happen. And all the things you ask in prayer, having faith, you will receive.

00:43:38.219 --> 00:43:44.619
That was a powerful object lesson on faith, especially in view of the trials that his disciples

00:43:44.619 --> 00:43:50.059
would soon experience. But do you see any more object lessons in this example?

00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:56.139
There's another connection between what happened to the fig tree and having faith.

00:43:56.860 --> 00:44:01.340
You see, the nation of Israel like that fig tree had a deceptive appearance.

00:44:02.059 --> 00:44:07.340
Although the nation was in a covenant relationship with God, it proved to be without faith,

00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:12.619
and it was barren of good fruitage. It even rejected God's own son.

00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:19.980
So by causing the unproductive fig tree to wither, Jesus demonstrated what the end result would be

00:44:20.539 --> 00:44:27.900
for those without faith. To benefit from this object lesson today, we also need to have faith

00:44:28.619 --> 00:44:36.699
and not doubt. In this talk, we will discuss four situations that show how prayer, study,

00:44:36.699 --> 00:44:41.179
and meditation can help us to rely fully on Jehovah's promises.

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:47.820
With each situation, we will look at the challenge we face, the promise we've received,

00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:54.059
and our reason for faith in that promise. Here's the first situation. It is

00:44:54.699 --> 00:45:03.099
when we are tempted. What is the challenge? The challenge is to avoid giving into temptation.

00:45:03.739 --> 00:45:08.460
There are many things that can tempt us to go down a wrong path and show a lack of faith.

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:14.059
We could be tempted by immoral desires that violate God's laws and principles.

00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:20.300
We could be tempted to set spiritual interests aside and pursue material things.

00:45:21.019 --> 00:45:26.699
We could be tempted to become prideful and ambitiously try to outdo others.

00:45:27.739 --> 00:45:33.900
We must never allow that to happen. The fact is that there are many things that could tempt us

00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:41.099
to show a lack of faith and of trust in Jehovah. So now there's the challenge. Here is the promise.

00:45:42.059 --> 00:45:49.099
Let's see Jehovah's promise in his word. It is twofold or two-part, and we find it at 1 Corinthians

00:45:49.099 --> 00:45:56.940
chapter 10 and in verse 13. As we read it, look for the promise, verse 13.

00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:04.460
No temptation has come upon you except what is common to men, but God is faithful,

00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:09.980
and he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But along with the temptation,

00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:13.900
he will also make the way out so that you may be able to endure it.

00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:21.980
What is the promise here? First, Jehovah will not let us be tempted beyond what we can bear

00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:29.019
or handle. Also, Jehovah will help us. He will make the way out for us, it said,

00:46:29.019 --> 00:46:37.179
that is out of any temptation if we rely on him. We must have faith and not doubt.

00:46:37.659 --> 00:46:44.780
So far, we've considered the challenge and the promise. Now let's examine our reason for faith

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:51.980
in that promise. Our reason for faith is this. Jehovah knows us better than we know ourselves,

00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:59.579
and his word says that we can remain faithful. In Deuteronomy 30 and verse 11,

00:46:59.579 --> 00:47:04.539
Jehovah told the Israelites that what he required of them was not too difficult,

00:47:04.699 --> 00:47:11.820
nor was it beyond their reach, he said. So for good reason, he expected them to show faith

00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:20.380
and to obey. He expects no less of his servants today. Let's consider some practical steps that

00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:26.619
will help us to resist temptations. We will list them first, and then we will look more closely

00:47:26.619 --> 00:47:35.179
at two of the steps. First, pray regularly for the needed strength. Second, study and meditate,

00:47:35.179 --> 00:47:41.340
so as to keep your mind fixed on Jehovah's promises. Third, know your weaknesses,

00:47:42.139 --> 00:47:50.059
and fourth, avoid situations that would increase temptation. Now let's look more closely at steps

00:47:50.059 --> 00:47:57.340
three and four. That is the need to know our weaknesses and how to avoid situations that cause

00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:06.219
temptation for us. We're going to begin with a chain. It's a fact that a chain is only as strong

00:48:06.219 --> 00:48:13.260
as its weakest link. True, where it is weak is where it will break first. Like a chain, we have

00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:21.179
weaknesses that others may not see, but we should know our weaknesses. Make certain that you know

00:48:21.179 --> 00:48:27.340
yourself and that you know where you are most vulnerable. When we know our weaknesses, we know what

00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:35.179
to guard against. In other words, we know where the weak link is. When we know our weaknesses,

00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:41.579
then we are able to stand firm in the faith. One sister said, when I face temptation,

00:48:41.579 --> 00:48:47.900
I reject it immediately. Letting the mind dwell on the possibilities is what gets you into trouble

00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:54.380
in the first place. So again, know your weaknesses and guard against those weaknesses.

00:48:55.420 --> 00:49:01.019
Another important step that we listed is to avoid situations that increase temptation.

00:49:02.059 --> 00:49:06.940
Stay away from people whose speech and conduct make wrongdoing look attractive.

00:49:07.739 --> 00:49:12.940
Remove yourself from situations where you know you're going to face temptations.

00:49:13.659 --> 00:49:17.420
Surround yourself with friends who encourage you to do what is right.

00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:25.099
Proverbs 22 and verse 3 says, that the shrewd one sees the danger and conceals himself,

00:49:25.099 --> 00:49:32.219
but the inexperienced keep right on going and suffer the consequences. We prove to be shrewd when

00:49:32.219 --> 00:49:40.940
we trust that inspired statement and avoid temptation. So in review, when we are tempted,

00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:47.420
we looked at the challenge, the promise, and our reason for faith in that promise. Then we considered

00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:54.059
what will help us to succeed, which included the need to pray regularly and to study and meditate

00:49:54.059 --> 00:50:00.539
on God's Word. With each of the next three situations we will follow the same pattern.

00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:09.260
The next situation in which we must rely on Jehovah's promise has to do with when we face opposition.

00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:17.659
Here's the challenge. Avoid compromising under pressure. No doubt all of us think at times about how

00:50:17.659 --> 00:50:24.139
we would handle various problems that may eventually confront us. Such mental exercises can be

00:50:24.139 --> 00:50:30.699
helpful, provided that we remember that Jehovah will always be with us when we are doing his will,

00:50:31.579 --> 00:50:38.539
which brings us to his promise. Jehovah will give us his Holy Spirit so that we can endure opposition.

00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:47.820
Jesus is one who trusted in that promise. He also urged his followers to remain calm and show trust.

00:50:48.539 --> 00:50:55.019
Consider what he said at Luke 12, 11 and 12. Now, as we read Jesus' words,

00:50:55.820 --> 00:51:00.860
have in mind that the scribes and the Pharisees were putting extreme pressure on him with many

00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:09.420
questions in an effort to use Jesus' words against him. Of course, they failed. And Jesus here

00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:17.340
gives assurance that like him, we too will succeed when persecution comes if we have faith and do not

00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:25.340
doubt. At Luke 12, 11 and 12, Jesus said, when they bring you in before public assemblies,

00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:31.500
government officials and authorities, do not become anxious about how or what you will speak in

00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:38.699
defense or what you will say. For the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour the things you

00:51:38.699 --> 00:51:45.820
should say. How can we receive the benefits of this promise when opposition comes?

00:51:46.699 --> 00:51:53.420
By listening carefully to Jesus' words there, do not become anxious, Jesus said,

00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:58.780
remain calm. For the Holy Spirit will teach you, show trust.

00:52:00.059 --> 00:52:07.900
Jesus is the greatest example of one who lived by those very words, and we can too, but it takes faith.

00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:15.260
So again, we've looked at the challenge and the promise. Now, let's examine our reason for faith

00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:24.539
in that promise. And it is this, Jehovah is more powerful, infinitely more powerful than any

00:52:24.539 --> 00:52:31.900
opposer. Here are three things all centered on Jehovah that will help us to face persecution and

00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:41.500
opposition. First, pray regularly, and when doing so, express your fears to Jehovah and ask for

00:52:41.579 --> 00:52:48.539
the peace of God. In the book of Lamentations, the inspired writer urged God's people to pour out their

00:52:48.539 --> 00:52:57.019
heart like water. Water can flow quickly, and like water flowing out of a large bucket, we should

00:52:57.019 --> 00:53:03.900
not hold back when praying to our Heavenly Father, especially whenever we are faced with opposition

00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:11.179
and persecution, pour out your heart to Him, and Jehovah promises that He will help you.

00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:19.340
We must have faith in Jehovah's power to help us and trust in that promise. As Jesus said,

00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:25.179
do not become anxious. Strong faith will help us to avoid such anxiety.

00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:31.739
Second, we are also help the face opposition when we study and meditate on God's word.

00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:37.739
Daily Bible reading helps to strengthen our conviction that Jehovah loves us and that He will

00:53:37.739 --> 00:53:46.139
never abandon us. Focus on His tender qualities as you read His words. A feel, Jehovah's love for

00:53:46.139 --> 00:53:53.659
you in the things that He says and does. As you meditate on the words and works of Jehovah,

00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:59.980
reflect on your own experience in His service. You'll likely be able to list many things that

00:54:00.139 --> 00:54:07.900
our Heavenly Father has done for you since you started to serve Him. Yes, Bible reading and meditation

00:54:07.900 --> 00:54:15.500
draw us closer to Jehovah our source of strength. And the more your confidence in Him grows,

00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:20.860
the stronger your bond with Him will become, and the stronger your faith in Him will become.

00:54:21.659 --> 00:54:27.019
Now related to what we just mentioned, a third thing that will help you when opposition comes

00:54:27.019 --> 00:54:33.500
is to reflect on how Jehovah has helped you through trials in the past. And that is exactly

00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:42.460
what David did. At Psalm 18 and verse 6, he said, in my distress, I called to Jehovah to my God,

00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:51.179
I kept crying for help. From His temple, He heard my voice and my cry for help reached His ears.

00:54:52.139 --> 00:55:00.460
So, did David recall Jehovah's help? Yes, he did. He heard my voice, David said, and my cry for help

00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:09.500
reached His ears. David not only remembered what had happened, he had faith that Jehovah heard Him.

00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:15.980
David was still putting that blessing to work because he never forgot all that Jehovah had done for

00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:25.019
Him. When you know that Jehovah has helped you, when you just know it, never forget it.

00:55:25.739 --> 00:55:32.780
We show gratitude when we remember and such experiences strengthen us to face the trials yet ahead

00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:40.940
of us. Now so far we've considered the need for faith when we are tempted and when we face opposition.

00:55:41.739 --> 00:55:49.500
Now we will again follow the same pattern with the third situation when we are afflicted with illness.

00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:57.260
What is the challenge? The challenge we face when we are seriously ill is to avoid questioning

00:55:57.260 --> 00:56:05.579
whether Jehovah will care for us. We must continue to remind ourselves that Jehovah loves us and

00:56:05.579 --> 00:56:12.940
that He will never abandon us. Remember the promise. Jehovah will sustain His loyal ones who are sick.

00:56:13.659 --> 00:56:18.219
And that promise is not just a general feeling that you get from reading His Word.

00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:27.099
That promise is a clear statement found in Psalm 41 and verse 3. We invite you to read it. Psalm 41

00:56:27.179 --> 00:56:32.940
and verse 3. But is it a promise to cure us? Notice what it says.

00:56:34.219 --> 00:56:42.059
Jehovah will sustain Him on His sick bed. During His sickness you will completely change His bed.

00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:53.659
Did Jehovah use the word cure here? No, He said sustain. Jehovah will sustain us. The cure will come

00:56:53.659 --> 00:57:01.500
later. But His promise to sustain His servants is a promise that we can trust. Here is our reason

00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:08.539
for faith in that promise. We know that Jehovah has compassion for those who are disadvantaged by

00:57:09.179 --> 00:57:15.500
poor health among other things. In verse 1 of that same Psalm we are assured that Jehovah will

00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:24.940
rescue the lowly one. Jehovah makes a similar loving expression at Isaiah 57 and verse 15. There he

00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:34.139
says, I reside in the high and lofty place but also with those crushed and lowly in spirit to revive

00:57:34.139 --> 00:57:42.460
the spirit of the lowly one and to revive the heart of those being crushed. I reside in the holy

00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:51.659
place he said, yet also with those crushed and lowly in spirit. Jehovah cares deeply for us,

00:57:51.659 --> 00:57:58.940
doesn't he? In his compassion he draws close to his faithful ones who are ill. But while we should

00:57:58.940 --> 00:58:05.739
have faith that Jehovah will sustain us and that is true, of course, whenever we face serious illness,

00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:13.019
what steps must we take to cope? Here are three things that we can do to work along with

00:58:13.019 --> 00:58:20.380
Jehovah's loving support. First, pray regularly for practical wisdom to deal with your illness.

00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:31.500
James 1 and verse 6 says, keep asking in faith not doubting at all. Earlier Jesus said, have faith

00:58:31.579 --> 00:58:38.460
and do not doubt. One sister with strong faith saw the need to do her part when she found out that

00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:45.659
she was seriously ill. She said, when I learned that I had cancer in my lung and colon,

00:58:45.659 --> 00:58:50.860
I thought that I had just received a death sentence. But after I got home from the doctor,

00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:59.019
I thought, okay, it's not what I expected, but I have to find a way to deal with this. So what did

00:58:59.019 --> 00:59:10.219
she do? She prayed and not just any prayer. She says, I never pray, make me better. I always pray,

00:59:10.219 --> 00:59:18.699
help me be strong and endure my illness. Beautiful example. That sister understands Psalm 41 and

00:59:18.699 --> 00:59:26.619
verse 3, doesn't she? If we do not recover from an illness, we have faith that the cure is coming in

00:59:26.619 --> 00:59:33.019
God's new world. In the meantime, we also have faith in Jehovah's promise that he will sustain us

00:59:33.019 --> 00:59:41.260
through any trial, any illness. He will change our bed as the verse said, meaning that Jehovah will

00:59:41.260 --> 00:59:50.539
see to it that our sick bed will not be one of hopelessness. Rather, we will endure with faith and

00:59:50.539 --> 00:59:56.539
hope. Many have found that their greatest comfort comes from heartfelt prayer and from reading

00:59:56.539 --> 01:00:03.659
such comforting passages in God's word. When we do this, Jehovah will give us strength and he

01:00:03.659 --> 01:00:09.500
will bring comforting thoughts to our mind. That brings us to the second thing that we can do

01:00:10.219 --> 01:00:17.179
to work along with Jehovah's promise and his loving support and it is this, study and meditate

01:00:17.179 --> 01:00:24.460
on Jehovah's promises in order to strengthen your conviction in the new world where you all have

01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:33.980
perfect health. That time is coming. As Isaiah 33, verse 24 foretells, no resident will say,

01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:43.340
I am sick. But we can meditate on such wonderful promises only if we take the time to read them.

01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:50.780
So take time to read a portion of God's word every day. Give close attention to the Psalms

01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:57.820
and to what Jesus did during his earthly ministry. Such accounts provide real life examples not

01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:04.940
only of coping, but also of godly compassion for those who are ill. And we also have such real

01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:11.099
life examples of compassion among us today. So the third thing that those who are afflicted with

01:01:11.099 --> 01:01:17.659
illness can do is benefit from association with fellow believers to the extent possible.

01:01:18.619 --> 01:01:23.980
We've come to appreciate this even more after living through a pandemic, isn't that true?

01:01:25.099 --> 01:01:30.460
One sister who has coped with serious illness says this, do not isolate yourself,

01:01:31.099 --> 01:01:37.820
allow friends to help you. There may be times when you feel alone, but don't isolate yourself.

01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:45.980
That's wise advice and it is scriptural advice. Always remember that the love we see among

01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:54.219
Jehovah's people is just a reflection of how he feels about us. After all, he gave us the ability

01:01:54.219 --> 01:02:01.420
to love others and his people show that God-like love for one another every day. So put your faith

01:02:02.059 --> 01:02:09.579
in Jehovah's sustaining power. Put your faith in the comfort from the Scriptures as well as

01:02:09.579 --> 01:02:17.900
the loving support of family and friends. Put your faith in Jehovah's sure promises and hold on

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:24.699
to the assurance that life is worth living even when you are afflicted with a serious illness.

01:02:26.699 --> 01:02:32.860
In all that we have considered about Jehovah's promises, we see that faith is the essential quality

01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:40.300
that we need to have. We need faith when we are tempted, faith when we face opposition and faith

01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:47.820
when we are afflicted with serious illness. We also need faith when we face economic hardship.

01:02:48.539 --> 01:02:53.980
After all, we must have certain things to survive day to day and to continue on

01:02:54.699 --> 01:03:01.900
in our service to Jehovah. The question is, how well do we cope when getting the necessities

01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:08.619
of life becomes difficult for us? Food, clothing, shelter, transportation, and so forth?

01:03:08.619 --> 01:03:14.619
You see, when these things become hard to get, it can cause anxiety. That's a fact. It can.

01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:21.579
And avoiding such anxiety is a challenge we may face. If we ever face that challenge,

01:03:21.579 --> 01:03:28.940
what must we call to our mind? Jehovah's promise. Jehovah promises that if we put the kingdom

01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:37.260
first, he will provide the things that we need. We must have faith in that promise, strong faith

01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:43.739
in that promise. It's a promise that Jesus made very clear for us. God's Son understood that in

01:03:43.739 --> 01:03:49.659
this system of things, economic hardship would sometimes befall God's people. And He made it

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:55.500
a point to include some comments about this challenge in His well-known sermon on the mount.

01:03:56.139 --> 01:04:03.260
But along with the challenge, He provided Jehovah's promise. Please follow along as we read Matthew

01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:16.230
chapter 6 and verse 33. Matthew 633. Jesus lived as a human. And here's a point we want to keep in mind

01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:23.909
as we get ready to read this verse. He grew up in a hardworking family. It may be that acquiring

01:04:23.909 --> 01:04:30.469
the necessities of life did not always come easy for them. But they trusted in Jehovah,

01:04:30.469 --> 01:04:36.630
and they had what they needed to serve Him. So what Jesus later said here, in Matthew 633,

01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:43.269
he said as a real person, a human who knew what people faced at times. So with that context,

01:04:43.269 --> 01:04:49.670
he had just urged his listeners to stop being anxious and to trust in Jehovah's ability to help

01:04:50.550 --> 01:04:56.710
them. And then he gave the promise in verse 33. Keep on then, he said, seeking first the kingdom

01:04:56.710 --> 01:05:06.389
and his righteousness. And all these other things will be added to you. The conviction in that

01:05:06.389 --> 01:05:16.230
statement will be added stems from the certainty of the promise. Jehovah cannot lie, and His Son

01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:23.909
does not lie. If we put the interest of the kingdom first, we'll experience the blessings that come

01:05:23.909 --> 01:05:31.909
from that promise. We have many reasons to have faith in those words. Consider, Jehovah provides

01:05:31.909 --> 01:05:39.670
daily for the needs of plants and of birds. So how much more so for His faithful servants? We know

01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:45.510
that this is true not only because the Scriptures tell us so, but also because we see it for ourselves.

01:05:46.230 --> 01:05:53.269
At Matthew 626-29, just before urging His disciples to put the kingdom first,

01:05:53.989 --> 01:06:03.030
Jesus invited them to observe intently the birds of heaven. Now why? What did He want His disciples

01:06:03.030 --> 01:06:09.590
to see? He wanted them to see how our Heavenly Father cares for those little creatures,

01:06:09.590 --> 01:06:15.190
how He looks after them and sees that they have their daily food. They have what they need.

01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:22.550
Birds do not spend their days feeling anxious and neither should we. Jesus rhetorically asked,

01:06:22.550 --> 01:06:29.989
are you not worth more than they are? Such lessons remind us that we should trust Jehovah's promise

01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:37.429
and in His ability and desire to keep it. We learn from Jesus' sermon on the Mount that real

01:06:37.429 --> 01:06:44.150
happiness and security do not depend on material things. What matters is our friendship with our

01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:51.989
Heavenly Father. So there are the lessons, but in practical terms, how can you avoid anxiety

01:06:51.989 --> 01:06:59.590
over economic hardship? Remember to pray continually. When anxiety takes hold of a person here,

01:06:59.590 --> 01:07:06.710
she might overlook things that they normally would never overlook. Keep praying and have faith

01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:14.789
in Jehovah's promise. He listens to our prayers and pray just as Jesus taught us, not for financial

01:07:14.789 --> 01:07:22.389
security, but for our daily needs, our bread for this day, as He said. And along with prayer,

01:07:22.389 --> 01:07:29.349
remember to study and meditate on God's word each day. This too can be overlooked when one feels

01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:36.550
overwhelmed. Don't let that happen to you. Jehovah will see your effort and He will bless you for

01:07:36.550 --> 01:07:42.630
relying on Him. Study and meditate in order to strengthen your conviction that Jehovah will take

01:07:42.630 --> 01:07:51.429
care of you. He promises to do so. In all of this, don't forget your past blessings. Just as Jehovah

01:07:51.429 --> 01:07:57.989
sustained his people in the past, reflect on how Jehovah has helped you. He has not changed.

01:07:58.550 --> 01:08:05.030
Use that experience to build up your faith and your conviction that Jehovah will go on helping you

01:08:05.590 --> 01:08:12.389
through difficult times. We live in a largely faithless and skeptical world, isn't that true?

01:08:13.349 --> 01:08:20.710
We need faith. And when we have it, we must keep it strong. When we have faith in Jehovah's promises

01:08:20.710 --> 01:08:28.069
and do not doubt, we are helped to face whatever may come our way. We are helped when we are tempted,

01:08:28.710 --> 01:08:36.229
when we face opposition, when we are afflicted with illness, and when we experience economic hardship.

01:08:37.270 --> 01:08:43.510
In these critical last days, all of us, each one of us, needs to keep growing in faith,

01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:49.750
cultivate the yearning that Jesus apostles had toward growing in faith. We can see their

01:08:49.750 --> 01:08:58.789
desire in what they said to Jesus in Luke chapter 17 and in verse 5. Luke 17, 5, please go to

01:08:58.789 --> 01:09:07.590
that verse. And we will also read Jesus reply to them in verse 6. After hearing Jesus warn about

01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:14.149
those who caused stumbling, we read starting in verse 5 that the apostles said to the Lord,

01:09:14.710 --> 01:09:21.989
give us more faith than the Lord said, if you had faith the size of a mustard grain,

01:09:21.989 --> 01:09:30.069
you would say to this black mulberry tree, be uprooted and planted in the sea, and it would obey you.

01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:39.590
In other words, have faith and do not doubt, he was telling them. Now, it is extremely unlikely

01:09:39.670 --> 01:09:46.550
that you will ever need to command a black mulberry tree to uproot itself and be planted in the sea.

01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:56.310
So then what was Jesus' point? It is this, we are powerful by faith. Challenges that may seem equally

01:09:56.310 --> 01:10:04.630
impossible have been overcome or defeated by our faith in God's power. Faith helps us to conquer

01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:11.829
any temptation that we face. Faith helps us to defeat any opposition that rises up against us.

01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:19.189
Faith sustains us through any illness we may experience and faith strengthens us to trust in

01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:26.069
Jehovah's promise to support us during economic hardship. In other words, uproot the mulberry tree

01:10:26.069 --> 01:10:33.909
and plant it in the sea. As we considered in each of those situations, we reviewed how prayer,

01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:41.590
study, and meditation will help us to stay close to Jehovah, the one who will grant us more faith.

01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:50.229
Pray for each day. Inmitate examples of faith found in God's word as well as those serving along

01:10:50.229 --> 01:10:58.229
with us today. Remain focused on Jehovah who fulfills all of his promises and he will bless your

01:10:58.229 --> 01:11:07.619
efforts to have faith and not to doubt. Thank you, Brother Cook, for that warm assurance that

01:11:07.619 --> 01:11:15.939
Jehovah will always do what he has promised. To conclude this session, we invite you to sing a song

01:11:15.939 --> 01:11:22.819
that expresses our need for Jehovah's help and our reliance on him. Its song number 118 entitled,

01:11:23.619 --> 01:11:29.539
Give us more faith, after which you may have the closing prayer at your individual locations.

01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:39.380
Again, that song number 118.
