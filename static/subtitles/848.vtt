00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:09.560
All of us appreciate and enjoy receiving a gift, but to be able to give a gift to others

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.839
brings us even more joy.

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:19.120
As the great giver of all good things, Jehovah rejoices in giving and wants humans to

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.800
enjoy giving.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.760
He is the first giver, He is the greatest giver.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.359
He gave life to Spirit's sons and to humans.

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:31.800
He gave Adam a lovely wife.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.039
He gave them a paradise to live in.

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:41.679
In turn, Adam and Eve were given the opportunity to give of their time and energy to take care

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:48.439
of the earthly home and to spread the garden of Eden into a global paradise inhabited

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:52.350
by righteous humans.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.950
Later in human history, Jehovah created the nation of Israel and gave them a beautiful

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.270
land full of good things.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.870
How could the Israelites show their appreciation?

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.030
Jehovah again provided an opportunity for his people to give.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.629
In this case, he gave them a command to tithe.

00:01:15.629 --> 00:01:16.950
What is that?

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.790
To tithe means to give a tenth of something.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.269
Israelites were to give Jehovah a tenth of all their produce and animals.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:35.069
We can read that account at Leviticus chapter 27 verses 30 and 32.

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:38.590
Follow me as I read from the screen.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.269
Verse 30 says,

00:01:41.269 --> 00:01:46.989
Every tenth part of the land, whether from the produce of the field or the fruit of the

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:53.909
trees, belongs to Jehovah, it is something holy to Jehovah.

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.670
Verse 32 says,

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.709
As for every tenth part of the herd and flock, everything that passes under the shepherd's

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:09.189
staff, the tenth animal should become something holy to Jehovah.

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:16.150
Did you notice that Jehovah said the tithe was a holy gift that belonged to him?

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.789
And yet, what did Jehovah do with that tithe?

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:26.069
He generously gave it or passed it on to the tribe of the Levites who had no land in

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.069
heritans.

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:35.990
Again, follow along on the screen as I read Numbers chapter 18 verse 21.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:42.550
Now see that I have given to the sons of Levi every tenth part in Israel as an inheritance

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:49.669
in return for the service they are carrying out, the service of the tent of meeting.

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.509
Verse 24 says,

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:58.389
For I have given to the Levites as an inheritance, the tenth part contributed by the people of Israel,

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:01.469
which they will contribute to Jehovah.

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:03.750
That is why I have said to them,

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:10.750
In the midst of the Israelites, they should not take possession of an inheritance.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:17.469
Think how this arrangement proved to be a blessing to the Levites who devoted their time and

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:22.389
attention to Jehovah's service at the tabernacle.

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:30.069
The arrangement also proved to be a blessing to all Israel to have one tribe completely devoted

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:36.789
to carrying for the tabernacle and later the temple of Jehovah.

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:42.990
But how would the Levites show their appreciation and love to Jehovah?

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.750
They also were commanded to tithe.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:54.509
According to verses 26 through 29, they would contribute a tent of their contributions which

00:03:54.509 --> 00:04:01.150
they received to the eronic priests for their support.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.349
It seems the Israelites were also required to set aside an additional tent to cover the

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:12.590
expense of attending the three national festivals to Jehovah.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.230
In the third and sixth year, these funds were given to the Levites,

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:25.600
alien residents, widows, and fatherless boys in the local community.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.600
So what have we learned about giving and tithing?

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.560
As we have seen, the tithing arrangement provided a wonderful way for God's people to show

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:44.040
their love and appreciation for Jehovah and to support pure worship.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:51.199
Imagine also how those who were disadvantaged, the alien residents, widows, and fatherless

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:56.560
boys also appreciated this loving provision.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:02.720
But did you know there was something else very interesting about the tithing arrangement?

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.480
No where in the scriptures did Jehovah arrange for any human to monitor whether each person

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:15.720
was really giving the entire tent of his produce and his animals.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:22.600
And no one was assigned to enforce compliance with the tithing arrangement.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:29.759
So although it was required by law, tithing was entirely between the individual Israelite

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:32.959
and Jehovah.

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:41.490
As the arrangement allowed each Israelite to demonstrate his personal love for Jehovah.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:47.730
But what if somebody secretly held back and did not give Jehovah the whole tith, perhaps

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.970
giving less than a tenth?

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.050
How would Jehovah feel about that?

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:59.129
Would he be inclined to bless those who were stingy?

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:01.610
That's not likely.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:07.689
On the other hand, how would Jehovah feel about those who generously gave even more than

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:09.490
a tenth?

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.930
Well we don't have to get, guess.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:19.529
Remember when faithful king Hezekiah promoted pure worship and encouraged tithing?

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:21.089
What happened?

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:22.089
Let's see it.

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:27.290
Second Chronicles chapter 31 verses 4 through 6.

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:33.730
Furthermore, he commanded the people living in Jerusalem to give the portion to the priests

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:40.410
and the Levites so that they might adhere strictly to the law of Jehovah.

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:46.810
As soon as the order was issued, the Israelites gave in great quantities the first fruits

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:54.329
of the grain, new wine, oil and honey and of all the produce of the field.

00:06:54.329 --> 00:07:01.329
They brought in abundantly the tenth of everything and the people of Israel and of Judah living

00:07:01.329 --> 00:07:07.009
in the cities of Judah also brought in the tenth of cattle and sheep and the tenth of

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:11.529
the holy things that were sanctified to Jehovah their God.

00:07:11.529 --> 00:07:15.730
They brought it in and put it in many heaps.

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:20.529
So how did Jehovah feel about the generosity of his people?

00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:23.850
Let's note verses 9 and 10.

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:30.129
Hezekiah asked the priests and the Levites about the heaps and as a rye of the chief priest

00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:36.329
of the house of Zadok said to him, from the time they started bringing the contributions

00:07:36.329 --> 00:07:42.649
into the house of Jehovah, the people have been eating to satisfaction and there is still

00:07:42.649 --> 00:07:50.850
an abundant surplus for Jehovah has blessed his people and this great plenty is left over.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:58.769
Yes, Jehovah, richly blessed faithful ones who generously supported the tithing arrangement.

00:07:58.769 --> 00:08:04.490
Sadly, Israel eventually lost their generous spirit and neglected the tithe.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:12.529
So some years later, Jehovah inspired the prophet Malachi to remind the nation of their

00:08:12.529 --> 00:08:15.449
privilege of giving.

00:08:15.449 --> 00:08:18.009
What did Jehovah say?

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:22.850
Let's see at Malachi chapter 3 verse 10.

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:29.490
Bring the entire tithe into the storehouse so that there may be food in my house and test

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:36.769
me out, please, in this regard, Jehovah of Armies says, to see whether I will not open to

00:08:36.769 --> 00:08:45.009
you the floodgates of the heavens and pour out on you a blessing until there's nothing lacking.

00:08:45.049 --> 00:08:52.049
Can you imagine that it was as if Jehovah was challenging each is relied to test him?

00:08:52.049 --> 00:08:59.330
Would Jehovah really bless those who gave him the full tithe so that they elect nothing?

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:03.129
Yes, absolutely.

00:09:03.129 --> 00:09:08.330
Today, of course, we are no longer under the Mosaic law with its tithing requirement,

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:17.570
rather than being commanded to give a tenth of our income, 2 Corinthians 9 verse 7 says,

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:25.009
let each one do just as he has resolved in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion

00:09:25.009 --> 00:09:30.049
for God loves a cheerful giver.

00:09:30.049 --> 00:09:36.970
So what have we learned from our brief discussion of tithing that Jehovah created us to find

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:45.289
joy in giving and we give generously of our time and resources because we love Jehovah,

00:09:45.289 --> 00:09:51.409
not because someone is so observing and keeping track of what we do.

00:09:51.409 --> 00:09:56.610
We also learned that Jehovah richly blesses obedience that comes from hearts full of love

00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:05.529
for him, but is there more that we can learn from Jehovah's dealings with ancient Israel?

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:10.649
Yes, we can learn from the Nazarite arrangement.

00:10:10.649 --> 00:10:12.570
What was that?

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:22.610
The Nazarite arrangement is described in Numbers 6, let's read chapter 6 verses 1 and 2.

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:28.450
It says, Jehovah spoke further to Moses and said,

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:34.370
speak to the Israelites and tell them if a man or a woman takes a special vow to live

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:37.809
as a Nazarite to Jehovah.

00:10:37.809 --> 00:10:43.809
Notice that Israelites, both men and women, could volunteer to become a Nazarite.

00:10:43.809 --> 00:10:51.409
This meant that they had to meet certain requirements that were not imposed on Israelites in general.

00:10:51.409 --> 00:10:54.529
What were those requirements?

00:10:54.529 --> 00:11:03.809
Verse 6 verses 3 to 7 explains that Nazarites had to, for one, avoid alcohol and anything

00:11:03.809 --> 00:11:12.929
made from the grape wine, second, avoid cutting their hair, third, avoid touching a dead body.

00:11:12.929 --> 00:11:18.690
By voluntarily submitting to these additional requirements, Nazarites demonstrated their

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:21.649
love for Jehovah in a special way.

00:11:21.649 --> 00:11:24.289
How so?

00:11:24.289 --> 00:11:28.690
Even that you hire someone to perform repair work on your house.

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:34.769
After performing the repair, the worker notices other repairs that are needed and he tells

00:11:34.769 --> 00:11:40.250
you he will do those as well at no additional charge.

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:43.330
How would you feel about this worker?

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:51.049
Would you not appreciate his extra efforts to go beyond what he was asked to do?

00:11:51.049 --> 00:11:54.370
You might even give him extra pay.

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:57.970
And how would he, the worker, feel?

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:06.769
Because he is a generous person, he will experience the joy of giving more than what was asked.

00:12:06.769 --> 00:12:08.850
The same was true of the Nazarites.

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:15.210
Jehovah did not require anyone to become a Nazarite, but he created this arrangement.

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:16.210
Why?

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:23.889
Evidently, he knew that some faithful Israelites would voluntarily submit to extra requirements

00:12:23.889 --> 00:12:27.450
out of their great love for him.

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:34.289
And their appreciation for Jehovah would prompt them to do even more for him.

00:12:34.289 --> 00:12:40.649
No doubt this brought joy to Jehovah's heart to see his people manifest a generous, appreciative

00:12:40.649 --> 00:12:43.529
spirit in this way.

00:12:43.529 --> 00:12:47.690
So what can we learn from the Nazarite arrangement?

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:55.049
That Jehovah deeply appreciates and favors those who show their love for him by going beyond

00:12:55.049 --> 00:12:57.490
what is required.

00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:05.090
Today this is true of ones who have their circumstances or the circumstances to pioneer and those who

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:12.529
are able to serve as volunteers at branch offices and in other theocratic assignments.

00:13:12.529 --> 00:13:19.769
As we know, Jehovah discontinued the Mosaic Law with its provision for tithing for Nazarites

00:13:19.769 --> 00:13:22.769
and for the many animal sacrifices.

00:13:22.769 --> 00:13:30.649
Colossians chapter 2 verse 14 says, Jehovah erased the handwritten document that is the

00:13:30.649 --> 00:13:32.049
law covenant.

00:13:32.049 --> 00:13:39.049
However, are there lessons we can learn from these past arrangements for supporting pure

00:13:39.049 --> 00:13:40.049
worship?

00:13:40.049 --> 00:13:41.049
Yes.

00:13:41.049 --> 00:13:48.129
Romans chapter 15 verse 4 reminds us that all the things that were written beforehand were

00:13:48.129 --> 00:13:52.679
written for our instruction.

00:13:52.679 --> 00:13:59.279
So does Jehovah's organization today benefit from the principles behind the tithing and Nazarite

00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:01.799
arrangements?

00:14:01.799 --> 00:14:08.559
How do we, as individuals, support modern-day arrangements for pure worship?

00:14:08.559 --> 00:14:14.039
And does a closer examination of the arrangements for pure worship in ancient Israel indicate

00:14:14.039 --> 00:14:18.879
a need for further adjustments today?

00:14:18.879 --> 00:14:23.759
For the answers to these questions, let us give our attention to Brother Samuel, heard

00:14:23.759 --> 00:14:30.039
a member of the governing body who will share the next talk in this symposium entitled Love

00:14:30.039 --> 00:14:32.879
for Jehovah in modern times.
