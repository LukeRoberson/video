00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:13.310
I was born in Malawi in 1962.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:19.550
I lost my eyesight at two years of age because of an eye disease.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.750
We have to rely on the reins for the food we eat and sell as it is our only source of

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.539
income.

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.460
I also look after both my parents.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.740
My father is 99 years old and my mother is 92 years old.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.219
Hoverty is very time consuming.

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.140
There are a lot of household chores to do to keep things clean and neat, like fetching

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.859
water for our daily needs.

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:56.020
In the evening, after we have eaten, this is the time for eating.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.460
When I was young, father took the lead in our family worship, which he still does.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.140
But now, because of his failing eyesight, I read to them.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.099
I read with my fingers, so nighttime is no problem.

00:01:11.099 --> 00:01:15.099
My fingers are my eyes.

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:20.819
One scripture that really touches my heart is James 5.11, which says,

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:25.620
Look, we consider happy those who have endured.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:31.579
Job endured his trials, and at the end, he saw all the good that Jehovah had blessed him

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:32.579
with.

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.579
This convinces me that Jehovah who act in the near future, blessing us with all the things

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:46.840
we are lacking, fulfilling all his promises, and so I am happy to endure.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.519
God's kingdom and His sovereignty are first in my life.

00:01:51.519 --> 00:01:57.239
It is only God's kingdom that will solve all these problems.

00:01:57.239 --> 00:02:03.959
I feel privileged that I have been able to save as a regular pioneer for 36 years now,

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:10.319
and I have been blessed to help 64 persons to know Jehovah.

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:21.419
I am so happy with songs of 76.

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:23.780
I don't see myself as poor.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.340
I have the Bible and many different publications in Chichewa Braille.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.620
We have the congregation, the ministry, and our brothers and sisters.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.699
All these things make me very happy.

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:58.979
We are not worried about our current situation, because we are spiritually rich.
