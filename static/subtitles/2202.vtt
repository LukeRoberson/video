WEBVTT

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.980
There's another one.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.719
It's a shooting star.

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:07.980
That's a star?

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.060
Well, technically, it's rocks in outer space.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.459
And when they hit the edge of the atmosphere,

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:14.760
they burn up and make that line you see.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.120
If we had a telescope, I bet we could see them better.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.200
Probably.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.200
Do you think we can get a telescope?

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.200
Maybe.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.200
You just saying that?

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.200
Maybe.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.000
Dad, come on.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.560
We'll see.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.480
You see that group of stars over there?

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.079
Yeah.

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:31.680
Yeah.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.840
That's called Leo.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.560
Do you know why?

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.120
Why?

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.120
If you use your imagination, doesn't it kind of look

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.359
like a lion?

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:39.040
Yeah.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.879
Yeah, it does.

00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:44.939
So in Latin, lion is Leo.

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.540
So dad, how many stars are there?

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.980
A lot.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.219
Only Jehovah knows the exact number.

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:56.540
The Bible tells us that he has a name for every single one of them.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.140
Hi, boys.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.579
I know you stay out here all night if you could,

00:01:58.579 --> 00:01:59.980
but it's time to go inside.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.099
Um, um.

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:01.700
Come on.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.939
Let's go.

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.459
All right.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:12.020
Let's go.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.080
Hey, babe.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.400
So?

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.400
What's in the bag?

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.360
OK, so I stopped at the store in the way home.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.280
Ethan, I thought we agreed we weren't going to spend any more money.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.639
I know, but look what it is.

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:28.479
OK.

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:29.439
They're going to love it.

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:30.560
Yeah, they can't wait to give it to him.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.400
I think I'm going to do it right now.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.629
OK.

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.229
How are my boys?

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.750
Hey.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:38.229
Hey, then.

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:39.349
What are you guys up to?

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:40.909
Well, I'm just drawing.

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:41.789
Yeah, Percy.

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:43.229
Oh, yeah, sure.

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:44.389
Oh, looks like Leo.

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:45.469
Yeah, it is.

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:46.590
Yeah, looks great.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.430
Oh, thanks.

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:49.270
So can I talk to you guys for a second?

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.870
Sure, then.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.750
I wanted to thank you both for being so supportive lately.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.270
I know Moni's been tired.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.189
We've had to cut back.

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:57.069
We understand.

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.870
Well, that's OK, then.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:58.590
It's great.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.270
And because of that, I stopped and got something for you in the way home.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.270
Really?

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.270
Yeah, do you want to see it?

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.270
Yeah.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:06.110
Yeah.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.020
Check this out.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.139
It's a telescope.

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:11.900
Oh, no.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.180
So now you can really see Leo.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.340
What do you think of that?

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.379
It's awesome.

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.659
I'm thinking maybe after dinner, we could check it out on the beach.

00:03:17.659 --> 00:04:38.110
Yeah, totally.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.949
You can hitch on it.

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:39.990
You mind if I talk to you for a second?

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.629
Yeah, sure.

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:46.139
Thanks.

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:47.579
So what's up?

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:49.939
You heard anything about the cutbacks?

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:51.500
No, I haven't heard a thing.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.300
That looks like we have to let some people go.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.139
And your name was on the list.

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:56.860
Did I do something wrong?

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:57.860
My work's been OK, right?

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:58.660
My work's been great.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:59.540
It's not that.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.019
It's a seniority thing.

00:05:01.019 --> 00:05:04.160
You just don't got it.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.639
I need this job.

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:06.319
I know you do.

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:07.560
Is there anything you do to help me out?

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.879
I'll take less money.

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:09.720
I know you need it.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.720
And I've been working on something for you.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.240
If you're willing to accept a change in position,

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.160
what is it, yeah?

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.199
Our sister plant needs a maintenance supervisor.

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:19.199
And it's salary.

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:20.720
So I mean, you're going to be getting more money.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.600
Well, that sounds good.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.399
Yeah.

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:24.120
You got a few drop-action, and you got the commute.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.759
It's a little ways, it's like an hour, 45 each way.

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:29.519
And then being salary, we're going to want quite a bit of OT.

00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:31.160
You know, we like to get our money's worth.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.240
Right.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.569
I don't think it's going to work for me.

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:38.930
Are you serious?

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.410
Yeah.

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.569
Do you realize what an opportunity this is?

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:44.490
I got guys lined up one in this job.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:45.610
I'm trying to cut you a break.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:46.209
No, I know.

00:05:46.209 --> 00:05:47.649
What's the deal?

00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:49.689
I'm a witness, as you know, and my volunteer work

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:51.370
means a lot to me.

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.370
And I'm trying to balance my volunteer work with work.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.089
And you can still have time to do that, stuff.

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:59.500
When?

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.899
Ethan, you got two options here.

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:03.860
It's promotion or deletion.

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.060
That's all I can give you.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:19.220
I'm sorry.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.300
You all right, then?

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.100
Yeah.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.540
No, I'm good.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.220
What makes you ask anyone?

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.420
I can't remember the last time you just

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:33.040
wanted to go for a walk.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:38.930
What's on your mind?

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.930
It's your brother.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.569
No, no, it's not like before.

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:45.250
He just emailed me last night, looking

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.689
for his birth certificate.

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:49.689
But I tell you what, my mind is spinning.

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:52.449
I haven't been able to stop thinking since he got in touch

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:53.209
with me.

00:06:53.209 --> 00:06:54.490
What are you thinking about?

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.209
About us, about our family, about all of the things.

00:06:57.209 --> 00:06:57.970
No, not that.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.250
Don't do that to yourself.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.889
I just can't stop thinking about some of the decisions

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:04.569
I made when you two were growing up.

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:06.329
I know, but Bill's the one that made the decision.

00:07:06.329 --> 00:07:08.329
You were great to us, always.

00:07:08.329 --> 00:07:10.209
Maybe.

00:07:10.209 --> 00:07:13.370
But you got to understand, son.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:31.310
You both are my boys.

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:32.149
Hey, boys.

00:07:32.149 --> 00:07:33.670
Oh, I didn't know you were coming.

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:34.509
Yeah, it happened.

00:07:34.509 --> 00:07:43.139
Thanks for coming to get us.

00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:45.339
So how's my favorite little boys doing today?

00:07:45.339 --> 00:07:46.379
I'm good.

00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:46.899
Yeah?

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:47.740
Yeah.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:48.540
You sound a little tired.

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.740
You must have an exciting day at school.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.180
Pretty exciting for him.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.420
Oh, this sounds interesting.

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:55.420
What's going on?

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.060
I saw Rowan.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.939
He was talking to a girl.

00:07:58.939 --> 00:07:59.459
Rowan?

00:07:59.459 --> 00:08:01.060
Any details on that?

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:01.860
No.

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.660
She was just asking about Homer, so.

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.500
That's because you're so good with homework.

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.259
Yeah, sure.

00:08:08.259 --> 00:08:10.259
Yes, Cory.

00:08:10.259 --> 00:08:10.759
All right.

00:08:10.759 --> 00:08:11.500
Well, we'll stop.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.060
He's starting to blush, Cory.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:09:49.000
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:49.759
I'm so sorry.

00:09:49.759 --> 00:09:51.360
I missed the service.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.200
I tried so hard to get here, but we had a layover.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:54.720
Everybody about it.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.820
It's just good you're here.

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:01.179
Ethan, I can't imagine what this has been like for you.

00:10:01.179 --> 00:10:06.639
I was in Cory, and I hear he's going

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:09.480
to get some time off of work just to process all this.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.889
There were cutbacks of the factory, so I got laid off.

00:10:16.889 --> 00:10:18.330
There's something I can do.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:19.970
I can give you some cash.

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:20.970
I'm going to get by for a while.

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:21.570
Well, we'll be all right.

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:29.279
Have a little savings, and your hope is going to provide.

00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:31.519
Look, I want to go see Sasha, OK?

00:10:31.519 --> 00:10:32.519
Yeah.

00:10:32.519 --> 00:10:33.679
We'll talk later.

00:10:33.679 --> 00:10:34.679
Thanks again for coming.

00:10:34.679 --> 00:11:11.529
Yeah, it's good to see you.

00:11:11.529 --> 00:11:13.809
I just don't understand.

00:11:13.809 --> 00:11:24.340
I could go over with this habit.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.139
I know it's hard to understand.

00:11:27.139 --> 00:11:31.740
Sometimes these things, they just happen.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.779
There's no one to blame.

00:11:34.779 --> 00:11:37.419
Your mom and I want you to know that we love you very much.

00:11:37.419 --> 00:11:40.340
Yes.

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.100
We're going to see Cory and Grandpa again.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:13:22.700
It's a promise.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.909
This is Ethan.

00:13:25.909 --> 00:13:27.710
Blood test.

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:29.110
OK.

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:30.549
9 a.m. Friday.

00:13:30.549 --> 00:13:31.950
I'll be there.

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:34.379
Thank you.

00:13:34.379 --> 00:13:35.779
What was that about?

00:13:35.779 --> 00:13:38.100
Doctor's office wants me to come in Friday.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:39.340
I'm just going to do it with my physical

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:40.500
from a couple months ago.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:14:42.090
Hey, Ethan, what are you doing here?

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:43.090
Just flew in on business.

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:45.490
I was hoping you might have a few minutes to talk.

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:46.889
Yeah, sure.

00:14:46.889 --> 00:14:48.370
Oh, I got these for Sasha.

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:50.009
Well, she's going to love these.

00:14:50.009 --> 00:14:50.850
Is that the store, though?

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:51.330
Come on in.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:53.129
Thanks.

00:14:53.129 --> 00:14:55.490
Man, it's really coming down out there.

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:58.769
Yeah, yeah, it just started.

00:14:58.769 --> 00:15:00.769
So did you take a taxi, ran the car?

00:15:00.769 --> 00:15:01.769
Not ran into the car.

00:15:01.769 --> 00:15:05.230
Just seemed like the easiest thing to do.

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:05.750
So what's up?

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:07.830
What do you want to talk about?

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:09.190
Look, I've been trying to think of how

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:13.620
I'm going to say this for a while now.

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:15.740
You know, Dad and I had our issues.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:16.500
What's that do this?

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:19.409
Just hear me out.

00:15:19.409 --> 00:15:21.690
I'm OK with it.

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:23.250
You just wanted me to be somebody I wasn't.

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:24.690
You wanted what was best for you.

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:26.610
You chose to leave that.

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:29.690
Yeah, I did.

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:31.889
You know, Dad wasn't going to change.

00:15:31.889 --> 00:15:35.330
I was not going to be a witness.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:37.330
I did what I thought was easiest for everyone.

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:38.730
It was never easy.

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:40.850
You say that.

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:44.210
After I left, you had his love and approval.

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:45.690
Oh, he was proud of you.

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:50.370
You gave him what he needed.

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:51.649
But Dad's gone now.

00:15:51.649 --> 00:15:55.289
So you don't have to keep making all these sacrifices anymore.

00:15:55.289 --> 00:15:56.970
What are you talking about?

00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:59.049
You honestly think that all this time,

00:15:59.049 --> 00:16:00.450
I've been serving Jehovah just to make that happen.

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:03.250
I'm just saying you saw how things turned out between me

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:03.929
and him.

00:16:03.929 --> 00:16:05.809
And you didn't want the same thing for yourself.

00:16:05.809 --> 00:16:06.370
I get it.

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:09.009
No, you don't get it.

00:16:09.009 --> 00:16:10.370
I've made these choices me.

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:11.889
Oh, you chose this.

00:16:11.889 --> 00:16:13.970
You chose this.

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:14.529
Yeah.

00:16:14.529 --> 00:16:17.169
Ethan, you don't have any money.

00:16:17.169 --> 00:16:18.090
You're drowning in debt.

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:20.490
You don't even have a job.

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:21.889
What's your future?

00:16:21.889 --> 00:16:22.809
We have a future.

00:16:22.809 --> 00:16:24.730
What?

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:31.309
Oh, the new world, right?

00:16:31.309 --> 00:16:33.470
Grow up.

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:34.909
Take care of your family.

00:16:34.909 --> 00:16:36.389
You don't have to live like this.

00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:37.990
No, I don't have to live like this.

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:40.950
Everything I've done, I've done for my family's spirituality.

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:41.450
OK.

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:42.750
Spirituality bill, that's why you don't.

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:47.409
OK.

00:16:47.409 --> 00:16:51.220
You know, I didn't come here to argue with you.

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:52.220
I didn't come here to help.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.730
I don't need your money.

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:58.139
I could see that.

00:16:58.139 --> 00:17:20.339
You can't live on these prayers and fantasies forever.

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:24.779
Fortunately, I caught the tumor in a relatively early stage.

00:17:24.779 --> 00:17:26.500
So what does that mean?

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.940
It means there's a good chance we can get ahead of this thing.

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:31.980
OK, so then what's the next step?

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.019
Well, there's a number of viable options.

00:17:34.019 --> 00:17:35.660
The first thing I think is best to treat this

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:37.460
as aggressively as possible.

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:41.819
My recommendation is surgery, as remove the mass.

00:17:41.819 --> 00:17:49.019
After that, we can talk about post-operative treatments.

00:17:49.019 --> 00:17:50.339
Ethan?

00:17:50.339 --> 00:17:51.940
Yeah.

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:53.380
It's a lot to take in.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:56.500
I understand.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:59.980
So post-schedule follow-up for next week.

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:50.740
Thank you.

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.779
Hard ships of the righteous one.

00:18:52.779 --> 00:19:42.440
Some visitors?

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.640
Take them.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.480
Just wanted to stop in and see how you were holding up.

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.079
And I brought someone with me.

00:19:48.079 --> 00:19:49.400
He looked familiar?

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:50.400
Ethan.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.559
It's good to see you.

00:19:51.559 --> 00:19:52.559
Victor.

00:19:52.559 --> 00:19:53.960
Yeah, you remembered.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.680
You were like 12 or 13 when your family moved away?

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:57.680
Something like that.

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:01.920
It's hard to remember you without the pink bike.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:05.119
You spent a lot of time looking at the back of that bike, didn't you?

00:20:05.119 --> 00:20:06.839
You wish.

00:20:06.839 --> 00:20:08.079
We'll bring you back, man.

00:20:08.079 --> 00:20:10.039
Well, I'm helping out mom and dad.

00:20:10.039 --> 00:20:13.599
He took a fall, so just moved in for a little bit

00:20:13.599 --> 00:20:15.319
till they get to feel a little better.

00:20:15.319 --> 00:20:17.880
Ethan, how are you feeling?

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.759
I feel pretty weak, you know?

00:20:19.759 --> 00:20:26.119
Jacob told me about what you've been going through.

00:20:26.119 --> 00:20:29.200
So, how's the roof?

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.240
The roof.

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.720
I think we'd lost a couple of shingles.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.359
I haven't had a chance to call anyone.

00:20:35.359 --> 00:20:36.839
What happened?

00:20:36.839 --> 00:20:38.200
We had a storm a couple weeks ago.

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.759
A tree fell out of it.

00:20:39.759 --> 00:20:41.240
Well, you know, that's what I'm doing for work.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.599
I have a roofing company.

00:20:42.599 --> 00:20:44.079
Let me come out and take a look at it.

00:20:44.079 --> 00:20:45.200
No, I don't want to be a bother.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.759
No, it's not a bother at all.

00:20:46.759 --> 00:20:48.440
Then that'll give us some time to hang out.

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.000
We can catch up.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.480
That sounds nice.

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.240
Thank you.

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:57.180
You're welcome.

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:58.619
Is it bad?

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:00.619
No, it's not bad.

00:21:00.619 --> 00:21:02.259
It'll be an easy fix.

00:21:02.259 --> 00:21:06.170
That's good.

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:08.690
So, I don't have my tools with me today.

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:09.529
So, I'll have to come back.

00:21:09.529 --> 00:21:11.369
But when I do, I'll knock it out.

00:21:11.369 --> 00:21:12.849
It's a quick job, a couple hours.

00:21:12.849 --> 00:21:14.009
That's great, thank you.

00:21:14.009 --> 00:21:15.890
You're welcome.

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:18.450
So, how have you been holding up?

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:20.730
I just started some new treatments, so...

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:21.769
I'm not feeling so good.

00:21:21.769 --> 00:21:23.410
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:24.250
What about work?

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:25.410
How's that going?

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:27.089
I'm a factory worker.

00:21:27.089 --> 00:21:29.250
Nothing that's exciting is roofing, but...

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:30.250
It pays the bills.

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:31.250
Yeah.

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:33.490
I got laid off recently, though, so I'm actually looking still.

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:34.490
Well, I have good news.

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:36.849
I think I might be able to help you a little bit.

00:21:36.849 --> 00:21:39.849
Have some leftover shingles from a job, and they match your roof.

00:21:39.849 --> 00:21:43.809
So I can use those for material, so I only have to charge your labor.

00:21:43.809 --> 00:21:44.809
Wow.

00:21:44.809 --> 00:21:50.140
I think that should cover it.

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:51.140
I can't accept this.

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:52.140
Sorry, Ethan.

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:54.140
I can't negotiate this price.

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:55.140
I know it.

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:56.140
I feel bad, though.

00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:57.140
I don't feel bad.

00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:58.140
Tell you what.

00:21:58.140 --> 00:21:59.140
Have me over for dinner.

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:01.140
We'll call it even.

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:02.140
I can do that.

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:03.140
Thanks, man.

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:10.829
So I was talking to Jacob, and he says they really miss having him on the elder body.

00:22:10.829 --> 00:22:11.829
Yeah.

00:22:11.829 --> 00:22:13.829
You just got to be too much.

00:22:13.829 --> 00:22:14.829
Yeah.

00:22:14.829 --> 00:22:15.829
Couldn't handle it.

00:22:15.829 --> 00:22:19.829
You mentioned they're willing to lighten your load a little bit, and maybe make it easier

00:22:19.829 --> 00:22:20.829
for you to stay on.

00:22:20.829 --> 00:22:22.309
There's more to it than that, you know?

00:22:22.309 --> 00:22:23.309
It's complicated.

00:22:23.309 --> 00:22:24.309
I understand.

00:22:24.309 --> 00:22:29.309
We'll just so you know, if you ever need to talk about anything, just give me a call.

00:22:29.309 --> 00:22:30.309
I'm always available.

00:22:30.309 --> 00:22:32.309
This is something that you wouldn't really understand.

00:22:32.309 --> 00:23:54.460
It's expensive.

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:55.460
It's expensive too.

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:56.460
Everything's fine.

00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:57.460
Everything's fine.

00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:58.460
Yeah, everything's fine.

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:00.460
I'm glad to see you.

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:07.579
I've been meaning to come over and just tell you how sorry I am about what happened.

00:24:07.579 --> 00:24:10.640
How are you holding up?

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:16.119
I remember when my mom passed, and it's just the hardest thing to deal with.

00:24:16.119 --> 00:24:21.839
You know something that really helped me was just realizing that everything happens

00:24:21.839 --> 00:24:22.839
for a reason.

00:24:23.839 --> 00:24:24.839
Oh, honey.

00:24:24.839 --> 00:24:25.839
I'm so sorry.

00:24:25.839 --> 00:24:26.839
It's okay.

00:24:26.839 --> 00:24:27.839
You know what?

00:24:27.839 --> 00:24:32.519
God can use these moments to mold us, and to make us stronger, and I know He's going

00:24:32.519 --> 00:24:33.519
to do that for you.

00:24:33.519 --> 00:24:58.220
I think the kids are coming, but maybe please let me know if you need anything.

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:21.660
Everything happens for a reason.

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:27.869
How was your day?

00:25:27.869 --> 00:25:28.869
You want to talk about it?

00:25:28.869 --> 00:25:37.759
Someone just said something to me, and he got me thinking.

00:25:37.759 --> 00:25:42.930
You know if there's something bothering you, we could talk about it, right?

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:43.930
We could talk.

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:44.930
Yeah.

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:49.690
Bike, you talk to me?

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:51.690
What does that mean?

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:58.700
When were you going to tell me that they might be another tumor?

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:00.700
Your doctor called me.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.500
He told me.

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:04.500
Not my husband.

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:06.500
You're right, right?

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.900
I should have told you, and I was planning on it.

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:12.380
You've just been dealing with so much, I'm still trying to process it myself.

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:13.380
Where's the team?

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:16.400
Where's the one flesh?

00:26:16.400 --> 00:27:07.859
Hey, Conrad.

00:27:07.859 --> 00:27:08.859
Ethan.

00:27:08.859 --> 00:27:10.859
What are you doing here?

00:27:10.859 --> 00:27:13.859
It's open to talk to you for a minute, if I could.

00:27:13.859 --> 00:27:15.859
Yeah, how'd you know I'd be here?

00:27:15.859 --> 00:27:16.859
Saw the car.

00:27:16.859 --> 00:27:18.859
Yeah, please take a seat.

00:27:18.859 --> 00:27:21.339
Thank you.

00:27:21.339 --> 00:27:23.339
So what's up, Ethan?

00:27:23.339 --> 00:27:26.339
I want to see if there was any way I could come back to work with the factory.

00:27:26.339 --> 00:27:27.339
I'm desperate.

00:27:27.339 --> 00:27:29.339
There's nothing to come back to.

00:27:29.339 --> 00:27:32.339
The factory's closing.

00:27:32.339 --> 00:27:35.339
I've been looking for a job for the past couple weeks.

00:27:35.339 --> 00:27:39.339
Didn't you tell me the schedule wasn't going to work for you?

00:27:39.339 --> 00:27:40.339
Yeah.

00:27:40.339 --> 00:27:43.339
I've been praying and looking for a job that will fit my schedule,

00:27:43.339 --> 00:27:45.339
and nothing's happening, so...

00:27:45.339 --> 00:27:49.059
I'll tell you why nothing's happening.

00:27:49.059 --> 00:27:50.059
Ethan, I remember when I was a kid.

00:27:50.059 --> 00:27:54.369
Dad went off to the first goal for...

00:27:54.369 --> 00:28:02.119
I remember begging God every night to bring him home.

00:28:02.119 --> 00:28:05.369
You know what happened?

00:28:05.369 --> 00:28:07.369
Two days.

00:28:07.369 --> 00:28:10.369
Two days before he was supposed to come home.

00:28:10.369 --> 00:28:13.369
He stepped down on IED.

00:28:13.369 --> 00:28:14.369
That was it.

00:28:14.369 --> 00:28:20.500
He was gone.

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:21.500
Prayer?

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.500
There's nobody listening.

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:32.380
And if there is a God, he didn't have time for us.

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:36.380
I actually got to get out of here, Ethan.

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:38.380
Sorry, I couldn't help you out.

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:40.380
Think of it this way.

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.380
This isn't the worst thing God could have happened to you.

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:52.819
We'll see you around, Ethan.

00:28:52.819 --> 00:28:55.819
We just wanted to come by and see how you were doing.

00:28:55.819 --> 00:28:59.619
Yeah, we miss seeing you at the meeting.

00:28:59.619 --> 00:29:00.619
Thanks.

00:29:00.619 --> 00:29:03.619
I think we've just been a little wiped out.

00:29:04.619 --> 00:29:06.619
Ethan, how are the treatments going?

00:29:06.619 --> 00:29:07.619
Same.

00:29:07.619 --> 00:29:13.759
By the way, the friends wanted to help with some of the expenses

00:29:13.759 --> 00:29:15.759
so they had a gift for you.

00:29:15.759 --> 00:29:16.759
That's so nice.

00:29:16.759 --> 00:29:17.759
Thank you.

00:29:17.759 --> 00:29:20.759
You've been dealing with so much and the congregation

00:29:20.759 --> 00:29:22.759
we all want to help out.

00:29:22.759 --> 00:29:23.759
Thank you.

00:29:23.759 --> 00:29:25.759
The friends have been great.

00:29:25.759 --> 00:29:30.140
Sometimes I don't feel worthy.

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:34.890
What do you mean Sasha?

00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:38.890
I've just been dealing with some negative feelings.

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:39.890
Like what?

00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:44.839
I as dad to pick up the boys.

00:29:44.839 --> 00:29:49.470
And I just keep thinking that if I hadn't done that,

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:54.470
I would still have my son and my father along with me.

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:56.470
Sasha, this is in your fault.

00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:58.470
But it is my fault.

00:29:58.470 --> 00:30:03.069
That was my responsibility to pick up my children.

00:30:03.069 --> 00:30:05.069
No, you can't blame yourself.

00:30:05.069 --> 00:30:08.069
Please, you have your Bible there.

00:30:08.069 --> 00:30:12.069
Let's re-description of Ecclesiastes 9-11.

00:30:13.069 --> 00:30:15.069
And if you can't just re-part me.

00:30:15.069 --> 00:30:20.579
Because time and unexpected events overtake them all.

00:30:20.579 --> 00:30:24.579
Now, what's one reason that perhaps Johova had this recorded?

00:30:24.579 --> 00:30:30.069
Well, he knows when we lose someone,

00:30:30.069 --> 00:30:32.069
we want someone to blame.

00:30:32.069 --> 00:30:34.069
Even if it's ourselves.

00:30:34.069 --> 00:30:39.200
But that's not.

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:42.700
Ethan, what do you think?

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:49.380
I know no one caused it, but nobody stopped it either.

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.380
I can seem that way, Ethan.

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:54.380
But Johova, he is a refuge.

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:55.380
Spiritually.

00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:59.380
Remember, Corey and Nathaniel are safe.

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:02.380
They're safe in Johova's memory.

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:04.380
I know it's been tough.

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:05.380
Johova gives us...

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:07.380
What do you know it's been tough?

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:09.380
I've seen the struggles of your family.

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:12.380
But what do you really understand about my situation?

00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:16.009
I mean, really.

00:31:16.009 --> 00:31:21.539
I can't provide for my family.

00:31:21.539 --> 00:31:22.539
At all.

00:31:22.539 --> 00:31:29.519
I wake up sick every morning, useless on the bathroom floor.

00:31:29.519 --> 00:31:34.529
Wanting to die.

00:31:34.529 --> 00:31:45.869
And what do you know about having to bury your father and your son on the same day?

00:31:45.869 --> 00:31:47.869
Tell me what you know about that.

00:31:47.869 --> 00:31:48.869
You're ready, Ethan.

00:31:48.869 --> 00:31:53.329
I don't know.

00:31:53.329 --> 00:31:59.190
I'm sorry.

00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:10.589
I'm bummed.

00:32:10.589 --> 00:32:12.589
Sasha, I want to apologize.

00:32:12.589 --> 00:32:16.970
I should have thought a little bit more about what I was saying.

00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:17.970
It's okay, Luke.

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:21.970
I had no idea that all of this was going on inside of him.

00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:23.970
But thank you so much for coming.

00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:25.970
I won't be the last visit.

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:26.970
And remember, Ethan's right.

00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:28.970
We've never experienced what you've gone through.

00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:29.970
But you did.

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:32.970
And Johova did not abandon him.

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:34.970
And he won't abandon you and your family.

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:35.970
Please remember that.

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:37.970
I will.

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:38.970
Thank you guys again.

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:39.970
Good night.

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:40.970
Have a good night.

00:32:40.970 --> 00:33:11.890
Look, it's my ruffer.

00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:12.890
Hey, good morning.

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:13.890
Got some coffee.

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:14.890
We're through without milk.

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:15.890
We'll have to get black.

00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:16.890
All right, cool.

00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:17.890
Thank you.

00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:18.890
Yeah, no problem.

00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:19.890
So how long have you been doing this?

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:21.890
Oh, not very long.

00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:23.890
You can just start the business recently.

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:25.890
What were you doing before?

00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:27.890
Before that, I was in Peru.

00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:28.890
Peru?

00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:29.890
Yeah.

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:30.890
That's different.

00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:32.890
Well, I was doing knee-grade work.

00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:35.890
But then things changed.

00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:37.890
And so I moved back.

00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:40.890
There's a little congregation in New Mexico that needed help.

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:42.890
So I went down there for a little bit and served.

00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:43.890
Busy man.

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:44.890
Yeah.

00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:46.890
You gotta stay focused.

00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:48.890
You know, I was thinking the other day.

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:50.890
About the cabin and the woods.

00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:51.890
Oh, yeah.

00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:52.890
Your parents still have it?

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:53.890
Oh, yeah.

00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:54.890
You know, you should come up and see it again.

00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:55.890
Yeah.

00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:57.890
I even cook a meal for you.

00:33:57.890 --> 00:33:58.890
Peruvian?

00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:00.890
Is mac and cheese and smoky's Peruvian?

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:01.890
No.

00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:02.890
No.

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:03.890
Okay, no.

00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:05.890
In fact, I'm a terrible cook, to be totally honest.

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:08.889
But, you know, love covers and multitude of sands, right?

00:34:08.889 --> 00:34:09.889
Okay, yeah.

00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:10.889
We'll make it work.

00:34:10.889 --> 00:34:11.889
Well, I'll let you get to it.

00:34:11.889 --> 00:34:12.889
Thanks again for the help.

00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:13.889
Oh, you're welcome.

00:34:13.889 --> 00:34:23.530
See you, man.

00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:24.530
Thanks again for dinner.

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:25.530
Oh, you're welcome.

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:26.530
Yeah, that's good.

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:28.530
So you know how when you're a kid, sometimes you remember things differently.

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:29.530
Yeah.

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:32.530
Then you grow up and you come over someone's cabin.

00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:33.530
Are you saying it's ugly?

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:34.530
No, I remember this.

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:35.530
It's just different.

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:36.530
It's just different.

00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:37.530
It's always been this ugly.

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:38.530
Okay.

00:34:38.530 --> 00:35:03.380
Feels good to be out here.

00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:05.380
I love this place.

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:09.809
Hey, I want to thank you.

00:35:09.809 --> 00:35:10.809
For what?

00:35:10.809 --> 00:35:15.809
I know you've been trying to encourage me, and I haven't been the easiest person to encourage.

00:35:15.809 --> 00:35:16.809
It's all right.

00:35:16.809 --> 00:35:20.809
I'm starting to see that I really need help.

00:35:20.809 --> 00:35:21.809
You're welcome.

00:35:21.809 --> 00:35:24.809
Hey, is the rope swing by the quarry still there?

00:35:24.809 --> 00:35:25.809
Oh, yeah.

00:35:25.809 --> 00:35:26.809
You want me to see it?

00:35:26.809 --> 00:35:29.809
I have a memory of you trying to backflip.

00:35:29.809 --> 00:35:31.809
I always wanted to be a diver.

00:35:31.809 --> 00:35:32.809
Come on.

00:35:32.809 --> 00:35:33.809
Yeah, but diving's like this.

00:35:33.809 --> 00:35:34.809
You landed on your face.

00:35:34.809 --> 00:35:35.809
That's how you do backflip.

00:35:35.809 --> 00:35:36.809
How do you do backflip?

00:35:36.809 --> 00:35:37.809
Check it out.

00:35:37.809 --> 00:35:45.659
How do you do backflip?

00:35:45.659 --> 00:35:47.659
So you go, friend?

00:35:47.659 --> 00:35:48.659
No.

00:35:48.659 --> 00:35:49.659
Let's carry.

00:35:49.659 --> 00:35:51.659
Who's that?

00:35:51.659 --> 00:35:53.659
That was my wife.

00:35:53.659 --> 00:35:54.659
Your wife?

00:35:54.659 --> 00:35:55.659
Yeah.

00:35:55.659 --> 00:35:59.659
Remember, I said I was living in Peru.

00:35:59.659 --> 00:36:00.659
Yeah.

00:36:00.659 --> 00:36:03.659
You were knee-gooders down there.

00:36:03.659 --> 00:36:06.659
You were pioneering, and it was incredible.

00:36:06.659 --> 00:36:09.659
It was the happiest we've ever been.

00:36:09.659 --> 00:36:13.659
And then, in an instant, everything changed.

00:36:13.659 --> 00:37:11.579
Where I had to leave, everything reminded me of her.

00:37:11.579 --> 00:37:16.769
I can't look at you now.

00:37:16.769 --> 00:37:17.769
How'd you cope?

00:37:17.769 --> 00:37:23.030
I still have some bad days.

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:29.619
But when I lost Carrie, I helped me realize

00:37:29.619 --> 00:37:35.789
that the only real hope I have was to help us.

00:37:35.789 --> 00:37:39.550
Sometimes it doesn't feel like enough.

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:41.550
I feel like that sometimes, too.

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:46.550
And when I do, I just find a beautiful, quiet spot.

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:48.800
And I just pray.

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:53.130
And it helps.

00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:57.500
Where it always helps.

00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:01.070
I mean, look around, Miss Ethan.

00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:03.070
But your hope has the power to do all this.

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:06.349
What can't you do?

00:38:06.349 --> 00:38:10.349
You can't help you find a job.

00:38:10.349 --> 00:38:16.349
You can't help you deal with this illness.

00:38:16.349 --> 00:38:18.349
You can't give you back your dad.

00:38:18.349 --> 00:38:24.860
Your way, people, you can do that.

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:26.860
I prayed, Victor.

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:30.860
I just feel like if I let go, I'm forgetting that I don't want to forget them.

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:33.860
You're not going to forget them.

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:36.860
But letting go of this pain.

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:38.860
It's not about forgetting our past.

00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:46.940
It's about remembering our future.

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:47.940
Thank you.

00:38:47.940 --> 00:39:17.630
So you were outside with Victor for a long time tonight?

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:21.579
Yeah, I guess I was.

00:39:21.579 --> 00:39:23.579
What were you two talking about?

00:39:23.579 --> 00:39:25.579
Hope.

00:39:25.579 --> 00:39:26.579
Hope.

00:39:26.579 --> 00:39:30.469
Won't you sit down for a second? I won't talk to you.

00:39:30.469 --> 00:39:39.030
I want to thank you.

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:43.900
For what?

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:46.900
But especially for supporting me no matter what.

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:51.469
Not giving up, even though I almost did.

00:39:51.469 --> 00:39:58.329
I'm so sorry for pulling away and relying on myself.

00:39:58.329 --> 00:40:01.329
Trying to and failing miserably.

00:40:01.329 --> 00:40:05.329
I see so clearly now that the only way will be okay.

00:40:05.329 --> 00:40:10.960
It's with Joel and with each other.

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:28.099
That's a family.

00:40:57.070 --> 00:41:10.239
It's not just Query.

00:41:10.239 --> 00:41:15.730
It's all of the dead.

00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:17.730
I think it's really different now.

00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:24.690
It's really hard.

00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:28.690
I'm so sorry for not being what you needed for a while now.

00:41:30.059 --> 00:41:31.059
It's okay, Dad.

00:41:31.059 --> 00:41:32.059
No, it's not.

00:41:32.059 --> 00:41:38.840
I never imagined we'd have to go through something like this as a family.

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:43.789
And we can't go back.

00:41:43.789 --> 00:41:54.110
We can go forward.

00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:56.110
I want to read you something.

00:41:56.110 --> 00:42:00.110
And this is something you've heard a hundred times.

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:03.110
But it's different now.

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:12.150
Because it's personal.

00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:14.150
You will wipe out every tear from their eyes.

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:17.500
And death will be no more.

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:21.780
Neither one more named or outcry.

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:23.780
Don't pain me anymore.

00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:27.820
The former things have passed away.

00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:40.190
What was promised wrong?

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:41.190
Through you.

00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:44.760
But it's up to us to keep it alive.

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:52.699
Don't forget it.

00:42:52.699 --> 00:43:07.559
That's the line.

00:43:07.559 --> 00:43:11.739
There's another mask with a turmeric.

00:43:11.739 --> 00:43:12.739
What do you mean?

00:43:12.739 --> 00:43:13.739
I can see it.

00:43:13.739 --> 00:43:14.739
You don't know how to read that.

00:43:14.739 --> 00:43:15.739
No, it's not good.

00:43:15.739 --> 00:43:18.590
Ethan.

00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:19.590
Sasha.

00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:21.590
It's good to see you both.

00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:22.590
So how are we doing?

00:43:23.590 --> 00:43:25.590
You tell me?

00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:26.590
Okay.

00:43:26.590 --> 00:43:27.590
I will.

00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:29.590
We've got your results back.

00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:32.590
And there's been a change.

00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:33.590
I knew it.

00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:35.590
What?

00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:36.590
I looked.

00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:37.590
I saw the mask.

00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:42.590
That's why we had trained professionals to read these things.

00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:43.590
This mask?

00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:48.119
It's not a tumor.

00:43:48.119 --> 00:43:50.119
This scar tissue.

00:43:50.119 --> 00:43:52.119
Ethan.

00:43:52.119 --> 00:43:54.119
It seems that your cancer?

00:43:54.119 --> 00:43:55.119
It's in remission.

00:43:55.119 --> 00:43:56.119
I'm sorry.

00:43:56.119 --> 00:43:57.119
I just haven't had good news in a long time.

00:43:57.119 --> 00:44:03.909
Yeah, I understand.

00:44:03.909 --> 00:44:04.909
It's been a long road.

00:44:04.909 --> 00:44:05.909
And by the way, don't have to look in the paper.

00:44:05.909 --> 00:44:06.909
Okay.

00:44:06.909 --> 00:44:08.909
Let's go for some other paperwork.

00:44:08.909 --> 00:44:09.909
Man dies.

00:44:09.909 --> 00:44:10.909
Can he live again?

00:44:10.909 --> 00:44:13.909
All the days in my Composauri service until my relief.

00:44:13.909 --> 00:45:39.599
For we were saved in this hope.

00:45:39.599 --> 00:45:46.639
But hope that is seen is not hope.

00:45:46.639 --> 00:45:49.639
For when a man sees a thing,

00:45:49.639 --> 00:45:51.639
does he hope for it?

00:45:51.639 --> 00:45:54.639
But if we hope for what we do not see,

00:45:54.639 --> 00:46:00.269
we keep eagerly waiting for it with endurance.
