00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:16.780
I love to tell people about Jehovah, that's been my way of life, I spent 35 years as a regular pioneer and special pioneer.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:23.780
Looking back, it's been faith-sensing to see that nothing can stop Jehovah's work being done.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:30.980
No government, no church, no judge.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:38.979
We came from Scotland to serve as special pioneers in Ireland in 1959.

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:46.979
The people were mesmerized by their clergy. They were very fierce in their opposition to us.

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:53.979
The tendency was if you get caught in a street, a mob would have eventually cornered you and you would have had trouble.

00:00:53.979 --> 00:01:00.979
And this is what exactly happened. Two priests came out and they started grabbing my case.

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:11.370
A mob started coming in and so I was beaten quite a bit after that.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.370
My wife and she shouted on them and that broke the spell of the violence.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.739
You're not my husband! You're not my husband!

00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:26.659
That was the incident that happened.

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.659
The branch office instructed us to take the church to court.

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:43.659
They felt that vicious attack should be discouraged and should be prosecuted properly so that people can see that acting illegally like the priests had done wasn't on.

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.540
They weren't going to accept it one bit.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:54.540
I think when I looked back, I must have been a bit fearful, but I knew that I was doing things in Jehovah's way.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:01.540
The branch obviously needed to get the message over and I was involved with it and I just went ahead with it.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:09.539
There was brothers from all over Ireland came to support us, plus of course the press, who made quite a big story of it.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.539
The evidence I gave shall be the truth.

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:17.460
They got the best legal counsel to protect the priests.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:23.460
They'd formally been the prime minister in Ireland and he was going to tear us in strips.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.460
He made quite an interesting attack on us to try and weaken us.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.460
He said, do you see the Bible that you swore to tell the truth?

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:39.460
Have a look at it again. He made his read out that it was a Catholic duty version of the Bible.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:45.460
He was trying to infer that because that was a Catholic Bible and I was a Jehovah's Witness,

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:52.460
that when we said we'll tell the truth based on the Bible, that we wouldn't do it because it would be a Catholic Bible

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.460
inferring that we would be telling lies about the priests.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.539
Our own solicitor did very little.

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:05.539
I think he was frightened, frightened to act for Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:08.539
He really was only going through the motions.

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:12.949
It was clear which side the judge was on.

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:18.949
He found the priests guilty of technical assault, only for trying to take my bag.

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:23.949
With that meant nothing, you'd been a naughty boy, behave yourself in the future.

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:26.949
That's basically all that came down to.

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:34.949
In his closing statement, he made a very strong point that we were bringing a foreign religion into Ireland,

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:36.949
Catholic Ireland.

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:41.949
No wonder they acted violently against us.

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:46.949
I think many of the brothers were quite astonished at the injustice of things

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:55.270
that the judge was almost turning the tables on us.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.270
But the thing is we seemed to cope with it.

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:12.229
Somehow rather, Jehovah wanted his name to be made known and it did get enough publicity to do that.

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:17.230
Things developed very well in the town and now there's a very established congregation

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.230
of their own kingdom hall.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:26.230
It was quite a unique experience to visit and to see what we'd shown the seeds on.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:33.860
The brothers had now established it and things had gone on very well after that.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:42.569
It was lovely to bring back old memories and talk to people and use the Bible.

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:46.569
Looking back, it reminds me of the situation mentioned in the book of Acts.

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:51.569
They were gammally or spoke to the sun-heedron and he gave them this warning.

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:55.569
Do not meddle with these men but let them alone.

00:04:55.569 --> 00:05:01.569
For if this scheme or this work is from men, we'll be overthrown.

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:06.569
But if it is from God, you will not be able to overthrow them.

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:12.569
Otherwise, you may even find fighters against God himself.

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:18.569
If we give a good witness to Jehovah, bless that, he's not going to let Satan's opposition

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:23.569
to attack us and destroy us. He's going to see what's done is what he wants done.
