00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:08.990
Well, everybody here calls me honey, but my name is Eastern of Zadol.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.990
And I was born in Fresno, California in 1919.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:22.989
I was baptized in 1935, and I thoroughly enjoyed my service to Jehovah.

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:28.989
I became a special pioneer, and then they called me to Gilead.

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:34.990
I was in the fourth class of Gilead that was in 1944.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:41.990
When I left my assignment as a special, I didn't even know what was the study,

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.990
but this was beautiful how Gilead prepared us for what was in the future.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:52.990
Right after Gilead, we went to Brooklyn, Bethel, for two years,

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.990
Esther Lopez and I. Then I was sent to Mexico.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:07.989
I came in 1947, and I'm still here, so that makes more than 68 years I've been in Mexico.

00:01:07.989 --> 00:01:12.989
When I arrived, there were seven Bethelites, and there were 22 missionaries.

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:16.989
And we all lived right at the branch, it was a branch missionario.

00:01:16.989 --> 00:01:24.989
The progress in Mexico really is because of the families being united.

00:01:24.989 --> 00:01:33.989
And when you get the husband and wife together, then the whole family comes in the truth.

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:38.989
In 1961, Sister Esther Lozano preached to our grandparents.

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:42.989
My grandfather first got interested through the book from Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained.

00:01:42.989 --> 00:01:50.989
When I placed the book with his wife, and she gave it to him, he decided that that's what he was looking for.

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:55.989
He says, well, when can I be baptized?

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:59.989
Three visits later, a study was started with the entire family.

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:02.989
And those oldest son was only 13.

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:10.990
He says, I'm getting baptized too, about a year ago he came and brought me a letter,

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:18.990
and told me how happy it was that I had gone to their home and preached to them.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.990
And that was a happy experience of my life.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.990
Today on our family, we are 23 witnesses, spread over four generations.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.560
And now my brother and I are serving here at the Central America branch.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.560
Oh, I forgot to talk about my husband.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.560
He was the branch who overseer at that time.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.560
We were there in the same branch for five years.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.560
We got to know each other, but I didn't pay attention to him because I was always in the service.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.560
And so, but I don't know when he decided he wanted to get married,

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.560
because I know that wasn't his goal in life.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:03.560
And so I wrote Brother Nore and told him if he was surprised to hear that we were going to be married,

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.560
then he did write me back and also said, well, this is what he said in the letter.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.560
You're always jolly and talkative when I'm around.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.560
On the other hand, Brother Lozano is so quiet.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.560
I must say it is an interesting combination.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.560
Both of you together can serve him and aid one another in your true worship.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:34.560
This is one of my greatest treasures is having that letter from Brother Nore.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.560
Then when Rudy died, I didn't dwell on that.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:48.560
I remember, I made my dedication to Jehovah, and I know that he would want me to put that first in my life.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:04:00.560
So I did not really suffer that much about his death because I became even more involved in psilocratic activities.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:12.060
I'm in the correspondence, but I met work about an hour and a half in the morning and an hour and a half in the afternoon.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.060
And the rest of the time, I'm studying here in the room.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:26.060
I'm so pleased that I'm still able to go to the morning text and have part in the service.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.060
I have two studies that I conduct every week.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:41.899
It's such a pleasure to be with people that dedicate their lives to Jehovah.

00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:49.899
And that told me to be happy because I know Jehovah and councilmen is precious sons and daughters.

00:04:49.899 --> 00:04:59.839
I don't know why, but many of the missionaries have come up to me and told me that I've been an encouragement to them.

00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:03.839
And really, they are the ones who encourage me.

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:11.839
It's because I had such beautiful examples to follow in all these years.

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:18.839
And all I can say to you is that thanks to Jehovah for this great privilege of serving him.
