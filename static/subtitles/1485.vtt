00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:08.779
While all of us take part in the commission to make disciples, there are also many unique assignments that support our primary work in the field.

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:13.779
Such was the case for those who worked at Kingdom Farm in South Lansing, New York.

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:21.780
See how their story emphasizes the need for endurance and love for people no matter what type of assignment we have.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:28.109
The year was 1935.

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:34.109
Humankind was on the path to a second and more devastating World War.

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:39.109
But Jehovah's Witnesses were busy sharing the Bible's message of hope.

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:46.109
In 15 years, the witnesses had grown from less than 6,000 to almost 60,000 worldwide.

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:53.109
Their preaching work was aided by a growing World Headquarters family in Brooklyn, New York.

00:00:53.109 --> 00:01:03.109
The workers in Brooklyn needed a source of food, so a 600-acre farm near Ithaca, New York was purchased and named Kingdom Farm.

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:10.109
Those at Kingdom Farm showed the same faith and dedication as Jehovah's Witnesses everywhere.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.400
David Abuel arrived at the property on January 1, 1935.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.400
The barn was burned out, only a few horses had survived.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.400
And that spring, the land flooded.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.400
Undeterred, David and those that joined him rebuilt the barn.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.400
They replanted the crops and began constructing other needed buildings.

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.939
John Booth, who later served on Jehovah's Witnesses governing body, arrived in 1941.

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:57.939
After more than 13 years of full-time preaching, it was difficult to settle down to farming.

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:05.939
Settling down meant farming by day, and study by night at Cornell University's library.

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.939
I applied myself to the study of animal and plant nutrition.

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:16.939
In time, we produced most of the food used by the growing Bethel family in Brooklyn.

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:28.580
Kingdom Farm was finally productive, but there were other challenges to face.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.580
Christian neutrality brought increased mob actions against Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.580
On June 14, 1940, Flag Day, a group of men approached Kingdom Farm.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.580
David Abuel recalls.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.580
We were put lies by an old fella who had passed by on his way to buy his whiskey,

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.580
to a plan by the town's people to burn down all our buildings and wreck our machinery.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.580
John Bogard remembers what happened next.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.580
About six o'clock in the evening, the gangs started to gather, one car after another,

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.580
until there were 30 or 40 carloads.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.580
But the presence of the police kept them on the highway.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.580
The witnesses were determined to stay on the property and wait it out.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.580
Late in the night, a frustrated mob finally disbanded.

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:28.889
After that night, the witnesses continued to reach out to their neighbors through their ministry and caring spirit.

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:34.889
By the 1970s, others, like Harlan Shock, were still making the effort.

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:40.889
I learned that a man that was involved in a mob action in 1940 later became a witness.

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:47.889
That inspired me to get to know the neighbors better and to offer other farmers help whenever there was a need.

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:50.889
Of course, they offered the same kindness as later on.

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:52.889
That made me feel good.

00:03:53.889 --> 00:04:06.469
By 1974, primary farm operations had moved to Wal-Kill, New York, as did many of Kingdom farms long time workers.

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:11.750
They took their cherished memories with them.

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:18.420
They left behind a history of faith and dedication.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:32.110
Kingdom Farm was used to advance Kingdom Interest for 80 years until its recent sale in March of 2015.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:39.110
Many who served there, like Brother John Booth, were also part of the anointed generation of Matthew 24.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:48.110
Although it was primarily a farming assignment, did you notice the attention our brothers paid to giving a thorough witness despite opposition?

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:58.110
Kingdom Farm was also the original home of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead, training the first class of missionaries there in 1943.
