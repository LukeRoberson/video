00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:06.219
Well, people today are very, very concerned about their appearance.

00:00:06.219 --> 00:00:13.380
In fact, it's estimated that worldwide, the cosmetic industry generates some four hundred

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.620
billion dollars every year, can you imagine.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:23.980
But what is it that makes a person truly beautiful in the eyes of Jehovah?

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.980
Well in our text this morning from 1 Peter 3 and 5, you notice it says, this is how the

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.899
holy women of the past, who hoped in God, used to adorn themselves.

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:37.140
Well in what way?

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.340
What was Peter speaking of?

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.780
Well if you go back to verse 3, you notice what he says there in 1 Peter chapter 3.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:52.420
Do not let your adornment be external, the braiding of the hair and the wearing of gold ornaments

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:59.659
of fine clothing, but let it be the secret person of the heart.

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:06.859
In the incorruptible adornment of the quiet and mild spirit, which is of great value in

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:10.859
the eyes of God, well what's the point?

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:19.420
Jehovah is focused not on physical beauty or on the adornment, the external adornment,

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.739
but rather what's inside a person.

00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:28.299
When Samuel went to anoint one of the sons of Jesse to be king, you remember he was

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:31.379
very, very impressed with Alayab.

00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:36.620
But what did Jehovah say about Samuel's attitude toward this son of Jesse?

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.019
Let's open our Bibles.

00:01:38.019 --> 00:01:45.450
Let's read together 1 Samuel chapter 16 and verse 7.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.689
It says there, but Jehovah said to Samuel, do not pay attention to his appearance and

00:01:52.689 --> 00:02:02.489
how tall he is, for I have rejected him, for the way man sees is not the way God sees,

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:08.770
because mere man sees what appears to the eyes, but Jehovah sees into the heart.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.289
Well, what is it then that makes a person beautiful to Jehovah?

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:17.490
Well, the key is what's inside.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.650
It's what Peter calls the secret person of the heart.

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.409
Well, that expression, similar ones like it, appear all through the scriptures.

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:28.770
Here's a few examples.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:36.370
Psalm 516 says, look, you find pleasure in the inner person.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.889
Teach my innermost self true wisdom.

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:47.689
About 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and verse 16, it says, therefore, we do not give up.

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:58.289
But even if the man we are outside is wasting away, certainly the man we are inside is being renewed from day to day.

00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:09.129
And how about Romans 7, 22, where Paul said, I really delight in the law of God according to the man I am within.

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:16.729
Well, all of these expressions really refer to the same thing, that inner person, that secret person of the heart.

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:26.169
Well, Jehovah is looking into the hearts of people and he's seeing that secret person, that inner man.

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:41.289
In fact, 2 Chronicles chapter 16 verse 9 says, that the eyes of Jehovah are roving about through all the earth to show his strength in behalf of those whose heart is complete toward him.

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:43.210
What does it mean?

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:49.930
It means that Jehovah is looking at the secret person of the heart of every person on this planet.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.370
He sees what's really inside.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:04:02.169
Now, can you imagine, can you even try to imagine what Jehovah sees when he looks at all those billions of hearts?

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:04.530
It must be quite scary.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.250
Because, notice what Jesus said, do you remember?

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:26.769
Matthew chapter 15 verses 19 and 20, he said, for example, out of the heart come wicked reasonings, murders, adulteries, sexual immorality, thefts, false testimonies, blasphemies.

00:04:26.769 --> 00:04:43.730
When I win Jehovah, looks through all those billions of hearts and he comes across one that wants to serve him, that's filled with love for him, that's willing to adjust and adapt in order to please him.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.290
Can you imagine how much joy Jehovah experiences?

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:59.410
Well, it really emphasizes to us then the need for us to focus not on our external appearance, but on developing that inner person.

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:07.089
As the song says, it's the person not the place, it's the heart and not the face.

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:13.019
Well, that's encouraging to many of us, isn't it?

00:05:13.019 --> 00:05:21.579
But we need to keep putting, we need to keep guarding against putting all of our emphasis on outward appearance.

00:05:21.579 --> 00:05:33.980
Now, one area, brothers, I'd like to talk to you about this morning, where people today have become focused on external appearance, is the whole matter of taking photographs.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:41.259
Now, all of us no doubt enjoy taking a photo with a group of our close friends or even with our relatives.

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:52.779
It's a nice way to mark a special occasion, isn't it? I don't know about you, but I have many photo albums of good memories with friends and family that I enjoy looking at.

00:05:52.779 --> 00:06:04.139
But the advent of the smartphone means that almost everyone today has a camera with them at all times at every occasion.

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:06.300
Well, what does that mean?

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:23.899
Well, you may remember that Brother Heard, in a talk at Gilead a few years ago, mentioned the challenge that governing body members and their wives and other responsible brothers and their wives have, with so many brothers and sisters wanting photos.

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:31.259
Now, do you remember what Brother Heard said? He said it was suffering for the sake of righteousness.

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:40.620
Well, perhaps we all laughed when Brother Heard said that, but Brother Heard was trying to help us. He was trying to help us see a point.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.459
But I wonder, brothers and sisters, I wonder if we all got the point.

00:06:44.459 --> 00:06:48.699
I remember that same day when Brother Heard gave the talk at the Gilead graduation.

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:53.980
Several people came up to me after they said, oh, wasn't that funny what Brother Heard said about the photographs?

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:58.019
Could we get a picture of you?

00:06:58.019 --> 00:07:02.019
Well, makes us wonder. Did we really get the point?

00:07:02.019 --> 00:07:04.819
Well, then we had a reminder, didn't we?

00:07:04.819 --> 00:07:11.459
In the January 2016 study edition, remember this photo appeared?

00:07:11.459 --> 00:07:16.100
Now, next to that photo, there was a box. Here's what it said.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:26.500
While we appreciate having an opportunity to meet and talk with visiting brothers and their wives, we would show a lack of respect if we treated such ones as celebrities.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:35.620
For example, would it show good manners to take candid photos of such ones without permission while they are eating and engaging in other activities?

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.939
Would we ask them to autograph our books and Bibles?

00:07:39.939 --> 00:07:45.379
Would we push in front of others and aggressively demand that our photo be taken with them?

00:07:45.379 --> 00:07:50.100
Surely, none of these actions display true Christian love.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:57.540
Rather, they could show that we have missed the purpose of the visit and the hard work that such faithful ones do in our behalf.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:04.579
What effect could such behavior have on those attending one of our assemblies for the first time?

00:08:04.579 --> 00:08:08.100
Well, that's quite a sobering paragraph, isn't it?

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.579
When our brothers please don't miss the point.

00:08:10.579 --> 00:08:16.420
The governing body, brothers, and their wives as well as other responsible brothers, we love going out being with the brothers.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.740
We love having association.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:25.699
But can you imagine going into a room of, say, 10,000 people where everyone knows you by name?

00:08:25.699 --> 00:08:30.500
And where perhaps even five or 10% of the people would like to have a photograph with you?

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:37.779
Can you imagine how overwhelming that could be for a brother and particularly even for his wife?

00:08:37.779 --> 00:08:39.539
Well, what can we do?

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:50.419
We have an opportunity to imitate Jehovah and value people not by what appears to the eyes, but for their beautiful spiritual qualities.

00:08:50.419 --> 00:08:53.460
And when we value them that way, what will we do?

00:08:53.460 --> 00:09:04.259
Well, we'll be moved to put away our camera and take the opportunity to focus on having an interchange of encouragement with these dear brothers and their wives.

00:09:04.259 --> 00:09:13.379
What a marvelous opportunity we have to be able to imitate our God Jehovah and show appreciation for the secret person of the heart.
