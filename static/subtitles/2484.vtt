00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.029
So dad, why don't we celebrate our first day?

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.029
Good question.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.029
How would you answer that at school?

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.829
Uh, because Jehovah doesn't like it?

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.829
Yes, but why?

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.829
Do you like presents and tricks?

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.559
But do you want them like this?

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:42.820
Birthday celebrations makes good things

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.219
with things Jehovah doesn't like.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.689
Long ago, many people believed in good and evil spirits

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.090
and were afraid of them.

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.490
They thought presents and treats on their birth they could protect them.

00:00:58.689 --> 00:01:03.890
And like today, they made wishes that only good things would happen to them.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.890
What does the Bible say about birthdays?

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.489
It talks about them, but not good ones.

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:15.090
There was Pharaoh in Egypt and Herod in Gisoo's day.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.890
They were proud rulers and had people put to death at their birthday parties.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.890
Can you remember if Jesus celebrated his birthday?

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.689
Uh, no.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.689
That's right. He didn't.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.489
He told us to celebrate the date of his death because he gives us the hope of living forever.

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:39.689
And Jesus taught us to give good things to each other anytime we want.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.689
Like... like today.

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.290
Good timing.
