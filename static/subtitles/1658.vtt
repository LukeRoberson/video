00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:07.750
News overnight, Steelers line back at Houston Worlds is walking away from the NFL and the prime of his NFL career.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:13.750
Worlds has, sir, has been with the Steelers for five seasons and started in all 16 games.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.750
He's just walking away from tens of millions of dollars. What is he going to do with the rest of his life?

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.750
No clue, but it better be worth it.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.750
My name is Jason Worlds, and I'm one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:35.609
My mom is a beautiful woman. It was in her early 20s that she was introduced to the witnesses and she took a study and six months later.

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:42.609
She was baptized. And so my mom put the truth before it's growing up, but I didn't see the true value of what it is that I had.

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:45.609
I didn't know how true the truth was.

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:49.609
It's vital that you set spiritual goals.

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:57.609
If you don't, the reality is that someone is going to set a goal for you, and I think that's what was true in my case.

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:03.609
I started playing American football my freshman year of high school. One of my coaches sat me down and said,

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:07.609
you can potentially go to college on a full scholarship.

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:17.609
I did everything to succeed at football, and so the dedication it escalates.

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:26.609
I studied the Bible for several years, but by the time that I started to make progress in my study, I was being quoted by the NFL.

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:31.609
I was whole soul to football.

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:36.609
And so I pursued my professional career.

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:41.609
When I was drafted, it was what I had been working towards for so many years.

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:47.609
That first year, it was chaotic, but then my second year, I got to a point in my life where everything was unstable.

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:52.609
I felt that the things that I were pursuing were fruitless.

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:58.609
I just felt hollow inside, right? I felt like if you shook me, I would rattle.

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:04.609
And I saw those who had more money, more success, and they weren't happy.

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:08.610
That was one of the motivating factors for me to say, you know what?

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.610
There has to be something more. There has to be, because I'm at the precipice of what I've always wanted.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.610
And the only thing that I can see is more angst, more headache, more strife.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.610
There was nothing there that was going to bring lasting happiness.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.610
And I think that is what motivated me to want to see what's in this Bible.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.610
And so I reached out and I picked up a study with a local brother there in Pittsburgh.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.610
But for a time, I felt like, man, I can do both of these.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.610
I got my craft here, and I'm enjoying it, and then I have Java.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.610
As a defender and football, there are certain things that you dream of.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:59.610
One game, I had one of those opportunities, but I didn't put everything into it the way that I always dreamed of myself doing.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:06.979
I let up the person that I was on the inside was changing.

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:14.979
That night, I sat thinking, you're not in the environment that's conducive to you continuing to grow as a spiritual person.

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:16.979
You might need to make some changes.

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:20.979
And that night is when I realized that, hey, you know what?

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:29.189
Yeah, I don't need this. Why are you here? What are you doing?

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:37.189
The reality is that I loved playing football. I enjoyed it, but it didn't bring true happiness.

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:42.189
I retired at a time where I was going to take the next step with my career.

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:47.189
And so the offers that were on the table were tens of millions of dollars.

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:49.189
And that wasn't what I wanted to do.

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:53.189
And so once I let them know that, then the offers increased.

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:55.189
But that wasn't what I wanted.

00:03:55.189 --> 00:04:02.469
I wanted to make the truth my own and get into the full-time ministry.

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:06.469
I was baptized September 13th, 2015.

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:11.469
That day was so special because Jehovah completely welcomed me into a spiritual family.

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:19.470
I've become a better friend, I've become a better brother, I've become a better son.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.470
There's nothing but wins when you serve Jehovah.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:29.470
The joy, the happiness that I received now and why I just rejoice to be on the ministry is because

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:35.470
you have an opportunity to actually affect change in someone's life and make them a better person

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:41.470
and give them purpose and have them have this same warm relationship with Jehovah

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.470
that you have is unparalleled. That's the fact.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:52.470
The more that we center our lives around Jehovah, the happy will be.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:59.569
That's where my happiness comes from.

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:07.569
As Brother World said, the more we center our life on Jehovah, the happier we will be.

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:16.569
To many, it seemed he gave up so much, fame, wealth and professional recognition.

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:25.569
But in reality, he discovered what was truly valuable, the good news of truth.

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:30.569
No wonder he was determined to make it his life's work.

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:39.569
We are happy that Jason has been serving as a member of the United States Bethel family since 2017.
