00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:16.519
I can feel lost sometimes, like I'm drifting out to sea.

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:27.120
When troubles in my life take me far from kingdom realities, but I'm never left in

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.120
the lurch.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.880
Jehovah hears and sends out the surf.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:41.880
He finds me, lifts me up in his arms.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:55.869
He carries me from, brings me back to his fold, my home, my family.

00:00:55.869 --> 00:01:03.340
I am never alone when I'm home.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:23.219
It's a shelter from the storm, where I find peace and rest, and loving friends will

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:32.299
bring out the very best, so if you find your route on your own, Jehovah will hear your

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.540
cries to come home.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:58.459
He'll find you, serving him was your best choice, your home, your family.

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:03.459
You are never alone when you're home.

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:44.919
We're so happy to see you found you, lifted you up in his arms.
