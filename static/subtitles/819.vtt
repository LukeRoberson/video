00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:07.580
After 2020 annual meeting, we announced an exciting new video project, the good news

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.900
according to Jesus.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.859
Brother Anthony Morris made the following encouraging statement.

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:17.899
Will there be challenges over here?

00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:24.100
Guaranteed, but if you ever want something done, that's what happens.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.780
How true those words have proven to be.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:33.500
Up to date, the largest feature drama audio video services had produced was a little

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.700
over 100 minutes in length.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:43.100
The good news according to Jesus spans nearly 1,000 minutes of content.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.060
We are happy to update you on this exciting project and share different ways Jehovah has

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.100
helped us to overcome various challenges.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.539
His insisters already serving at the Austral Asia branch were key to helping us get the

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:01.979
facilities ready.

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:08.579
How did they handle this special assignment, especially during the pandemic?

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:14.700
We were all very excited, but as the scope of this project became clear, there were times

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.260
when we wondered how a small publisher base of around 68,000 would be able to fully support

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.060
this large undertaking.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.340
We were a small department and it's a small branch that we're at, and all of a sudden

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.019
we had this project highlighted that it was three times our normal workload.

00:01:33.019 --> 00:01:37.459
Right after we received approval for the project, the branch territory experienced terrible

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:41.700
bushfires, raging right throughout the country.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.620
Straight after this were floods, so many of our brothers experienced double disasters.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.180
As we then started to recover from this and build momentum to start the project, the

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.290
COVID-19 pandemic began.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.049
All the deliveries of construction materials coming into the branch had to be quarantined,

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.810
all the bulk supplies that the construction department was using.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.370
And so that meant there was a time period for those things to be unavailable for use.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:13.129
And then the logistics of once all those bulk supplies came out of quarantine to then

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:17.569
move to where they're needed on the site when new deliveries are coming in and managing

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.370
that safely with the COVID-19 risks and the risks of interaction with the delivery drivers

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.729
and the contractors.

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:27.650
It was complicated and very time consuming for all involved.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.330
We needed help from our brothers and sisters outside of Bethel.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.129
So we put the call out and they came from all over the branch territory to help.

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:41.409
Many of them travelled days on rough and rugged roads to come and help us.

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:45.610
When they arrived, they spent a time in quarantine and then they were able to come and help

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.009
us safely on site.

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:52.930
There were specific items needed for the project, so we asked the brothers and sisters to help

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.169
us to see where or how we could obtain them.

00:02:56.169 --> 00:03:00.050
It was so heartwarming to see all the responses flooding in.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.689
Within a short amount of time, we had received offers for donations or loans, for much of

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:12.409
the heavy machinery or large equipment we needed and even things like plants for landscaping.

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:16.250
So we bought in a number of temporary workers and a number of remote workers as well.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.889
We're added to the team.

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:21.849
And the branch committee made available a large car parking area so that we could quarantine

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:26.490
off all the deliveries and handle those things safely and in line with the guidelines.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:32.090
So at the beginning of the project, the number was about 200 people in the family and that

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.930
quickly grew to around 500.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.610
And while we have a beautiful kitchen here to serve food from, it wasn't really designed

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.169
for 500 meals each day.

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:50.490
The branch committee, as well as various departments, although they had a heavy workload themselves,

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:56.370
they were able to extend a helping hand where we lost commuters, we gained some workers

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:03.449
from various departments who helped us in various tasks within the food service.

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:08.530
So it was clear to everybody in the department and at the branch that it really needed to

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.449
be a team effort and everybody going above and beyond to make this work.

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:15.530
But that only takes you so far.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.009
Jehovah's blessing on the arrangements, the qualities that he helps us to show the

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:26.170
motivation that he helps us to have to overcome those challenges and to take on things that

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.449
really are beyond what we can normally cope with.

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.290
And seeing that, particularly as we look back on a number of those challenges and how they've

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.250
been overcome, you see Jehovah's involvement day to day.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.850
A brother had a trailer that was going to be donated to the project, but he didn't have

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.810
the funds to pay for the freight.

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.769
At the very same time, the sister contacted the branch and wanted to donate specifically

00:04:49.769 --> 00:04:51.410
to the project.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.250
The amount she donated was a amount that was needed to cover the freight to bring the

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.050
trailer to Bethel.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.850
One brother made a 30-hour round trip to deliver a large quantity of goods he manufactured

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:03.930
for us.

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:10.730
He made this trip not once or twice, but multiple times, even planning the work around two surgeries

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.329
he had to have.

00:05:12.329 --> 00:05:17.970
A number of trucks were required to freight the goods, so members of his family and congregation

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.290
shared in the driving, while local brothers extended hospitality.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:31.209
I'm very impressed with the level of appreciation, the sense of gratitude that permeates the family,

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:37.529
and seeing that is a real boost for us and the real blessing.

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:42.769
We feel very appreciative for everyone who's been able to help on this project, recognising

00:05:42.769 --> 00:05:46.769
their personal and collective sacrifices that have been made.

00:05:46.769 --> 00:05:51.009
For those who have been able to come in and help us on the project, tell us how thankful

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:54.410
they are to have had a share in the project.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:59.250
Only Jehovah can create a situation like this.

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:06.569
Jehovah always finds a way to help us do his will, often providing solutions we never

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:09.290
thought possible.

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:14.889
In addition to preparing the Australasia facility for the project, much work has been done

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:21.009
with script development, casting and location scouting.

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:24.050
How has this progressed?

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:31.329
We recognise that there would be many needed adjustments to the branch there as far as

00:06:31.329 --> 00:06:33.410
facilities is concerned.

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:39.689
We knew that there would be the need for many volunteers to be involved in the project,

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:45.410
and we knew it was going to be coordinated from halfway around the world.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:49.490
The challenge with finding locations for the Gospel accounts is that they need to look

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:54.370
like ancient lands, but be placed in a modern world.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:07:00.009
They need to have no signs of civilisation, and yet be close enough to civilisation to

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:02.889
support our modern filming operations.

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:11.050
We were asked to flesh out an entire world, a culture and hundreds, actually thousands

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:16.209
of characters that appear in these accounts, to do so with very limited information actually

00:07:16.209 --> 00:07:17.730
in the Bible.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:23.449
How do we add enough details to connect with the audience, but without overstepping by

00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:29.209
introducing teachings or ideas that contradict the Bible's message?

00:07:29.209 --> 00:07:35.250
We can truly say it was a worldwide effort on the part of our brothers and sisters.

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:40.649
It was especially encouraging to see how young ones responded to this need.

00:07:40.649 --> 00:07:44.769
They were looking to extend themselves in their service to Jehovah, and they were willing

00:07:44.769 --> 00:07:50.569
to adjust their secular jobs, they were willing to move to other locations in order to be

00:07:50.569 --> 00:07:53.889
able to support this project.

00:07:53.889 --> 00:08:01.170
We were looking at how we could accomplish so many auditions in a shorter period of time.

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:08.329
So we came up with the idea of a self-guided audition, where we put a package together identifying

00:08:08.329 --> 00:08:13.769
how the audition needs to be accomplished, and we send it to the publisher that's being

00:08:13.769 --> 00:08:20.529
auditioned, and they record their own audition and send it back to us for processing.

00:08:20.529 --> 00:08:23.370
While we were at some of the locations, we actually did test filming.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:28.329
We put actors in wardrobe in front of the camera and recreated certain scenes to see how

00:08:28.329 --> 00:08:32.730
this location could be used for our project.

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:37.090
We were able to travel to more than a dozen locations during a month, and everyone returned

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:39.610
happy and healthy.

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:43.929
There's some accounts in the gospels that reference large groups, such as the sermon

00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:49.570
on the Mount, and when Jesus preached from the boat, how would we show that many people?

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:55.289
The team took time to test various methods, including some computer graphics, as well

00:08:55.289 --> 00:09:02.370
as different styles and methods to be used to duplicate people for these large crowds.

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:07.730
The production team was able to see what did and did not work, and this is very beneficial

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:13.330
because it helps us to plan appropriately for the actual production day.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:17.649
And so it's simply a matter of going and doing as much research as possible to find out

00:09:17.649 --> 00:09:18.970
what is known.

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:23.129
And of course, there's an entire team devoted to doing research for our publications, and

00:09:23.129 --> 00:09:26.210
we have access to those brothers and sisters.

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:30.809
Something that has been incredibly valuable for every screenwriter on this project is to

00:09:30.809 --> 00:09:35.690
see members of the teaching committee sit at every table read for each script, and then

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:41.210
proceed to give us direction, ask questions, give us direction on what to go and research

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:46.129
further, what to remove, and in many cases, what to add.

00:09:46.129 --> 00:09:50.809
It shows how deeply they're invested in the story of Jesus' life.

00:09:50.809 --> 00:09:57.210
It felt like Jehovah had taken us and placed us into a land thousands of years ago.

00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:01.690
When we got to these various locations, we literally would jump out of the vehicles

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:07.090
and run across the landscape and excitement for how we could potentially use them.

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:11.690
One of the biggest challenges we had was getting everyone back into the vehicles so that

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:14.009
we could go on to the next location.

00:10:14.049 --> 00:10:19.929
We went to one property, and when we talked with the brother, he said, this isn't my property.

00:10:19.929 --> 00:10:21.809
This belongs to Jehovah.

00:10:21.809 --> 00:10:23.250
I'm holding on to it.

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:28.210
I'm not sure why, hoping that perhaps Jehovah can use it in some way.

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:33.250
And when you think about all of our brothers and sisters coming together to support this

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:37.850
initiative, it really has been a blessing to be able to witness that.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:43.610
It really reminds me of what is said in Psalm 133 verse 1 where it said it would be good

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:46.769
to see brothers and sisters dwelling together in unity.

00:10:46.769 --> 00:10:48.529
And we've seen that goodness.

00:10:48.529 --> 00:10:54.889
We've seen our brotherhood really rally around supporting this project in so many ways,

00:10:54.889 --> 00:11:01.610
and it has contributed towards a spirit that has allowed Jehovah to bless the work.

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:07.490
Would you like to see how the design and construction aspects of the work are progressing, including

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:09.450
the historical sets?

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:15.610
One of the biggest challenges we've had in the design construction world is to get the

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:22.289
mentality that we're designing and building something that needs to look 2,000 years old.

00:11:23.289 --> 00:11:27.929
We're used to building modern buildings, and we're used to using the materials that we have today,

00:11:27.929 --> 00:11:32.690
but to now use those to provide something that was ancient, that was going to be quite the challenge.

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:37.649
In Jesus' ministry, he went to numerous different towns,

00:11:37.649 --> 00:11:42.529
and those towns would have had different looks because of the natural products that were available

00:11:42.529 --> 00:11:45.730
to the tradesmen then to build those buildings.

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:54.049
Back in ancient Israel, the building materials would have been stone, so they would have used limestone,

00:11:54.049 --> 00:11:57.649
basalt, field stones, and even clay bricks.

00:11:57.649 --> 00:12:02.809
There's probably just over 100 doors and gates out there.

00:12:02.809 --> 00:12:06.649
There's also over 200 windows and we've got shutters,

00:12:06.649 --> 00:12:10.649
and all of these need either timber lentils or timber seals.

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:16.690
You have tradesmen that are used to getting things you could say nearly perfect.

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:20.690
Normally, as a renderer or a plasterer, you would cover up cracks,

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:24.009
but here we're having to actually create these.

00:12:24.009 --> 00:12:26.210
That can be quite a challenge.

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:33.690
Back a few years ago, there were various branches that were put forward as possibilities, as options,

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:36.929
and in the end, the Austral Asia branch was chosen.

00:12:36.929 --> 00:12:42.889
At the time, in the design construction world, we thought that was an interesting choice,

00:12:42.889 --> 00:12:47.889
but during 2020, during the pandemic, we found out in retrospect

00:12:47.889 --> 00:12:52.210
that it was one of the only places on Earth where this project could be completed now.

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:56.529
Because of the low incidence of COVID in the country,

00:12:56.529 --> 00:13:02.889
we were able to use outside contractors to come into the project to do part of the site works for us.

00:13:02.889 --> 00:13:07.490
So, it's been a blessing to have the project take place at this location.

00:13:08.769 --> 00:13:12.730
Those that we had on site here already, they were very open-minded,

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:20.690
and they had a lot of creative thinking when it came to building historical sets now with modern materials.

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:26.929
So, we have about 7,000 square metres of render to accomplish,

00:13:26.929 --> 00:13:32.850
and we'll have two teams working full-time for several months to accomplish this.

00:13:38.299 --> 00:13:43.220
In this particular type of work, nobody's trade really counted.

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:48.500
Everybody had to try, and many of our sisters, in fact, were the ones that had the skills that were needed

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:54.279
to create the historical effect that was required.

00:13:54.279 --> 00:14:01.679
To achieve the weathering that would happen on the stone, if it sat there for hundreds of years out in the weather,

00:14:01.679 --> 00:14:06.320
the water would get into the stone and slowly break it down.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:11.039
So, then there's going to be areas of the stone that are softer, so they'll wear away quicker,

00:14:11.039 --> 00:14:17.399
so then that's done with the wire brush, and then some spots with the acetone,

00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:23.279
it puts little divots into the stone which occur naturally in limestone.

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:26.240
Once the project's completed in the back lot,

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:37.659
the brothers and sisters would have applied up to like 4,500 square metres of stone finished to the buildings.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:44.539
It's been amazing to see how with a variety of backgrounds, despite this,

00:14:44.539 --> 00:14:48.700
they've been able to achieve quite amazing things.

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:54.059
Just their willing spirit prepared to take on board the instruction,

00:14:54.059 --> 00:14:57.139
and we can see Jehovah's blessing behind it.

00:14:57.139 --> 00:15:03.059
In the temple area, in the back lot, there's a little over 4,000 square metres of concrete

00:15:03.059 --> 00:15:05.899
that has been made to look like stone.

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:09.940
Well, one of the contractors that quoted on the job was actually a brother,

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:13.500
and that particular brother said, well, you know what, I can volunteer to do this,

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:16.580
and there's enough brothers around that we can bring together,

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:20.620
and we would be more than happy to be able to do it on a volunteer basis.

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:25.340
So, an isolated area was set up, where these brothers could test and sample

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:29.620
and produce the concrete that was needed for the floor finish of the temple.

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:32.820
So, over 27 days of straight pause,

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:37.899
we had approximately 30 brothers and sisters each day come in and work tirelessly

00:15:37.899 --> 00:15:41.340
to be able to accomplish this temple floor for us.

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:47.179
The last day of the concrete pull, we wanted to surprise the brothers,

00:15:47.179 --> 00:15:51.259
because someone had made a sign saying, united in spirit.

00:15:51.259 --> 00:15:54.620
But actually, the construction both the lights surprised us.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:59.059
They all had balloons and signs, and it spelt out, thank you.

00:15:59.059 --> 00:16:02.100
I think that just reflected how we love each other,

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:04.059
and we'd give our life for each other,

00:16:04.059 --> 00:16:07.299
because we both serve the same God and we love Jehovah.

00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:11.379
Three lots of sleepless lights and bear prayer about it.

00:16:11.379 --> 00:16:16.620
We ended up finding a brother who owned a sawmill and had property with trees on it,

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:20.419
and he willingly chopped down the trees on his property

00:16:20.419 --> 00:16:24.779
and provided them for us to deliver them to site and actually donated them to us,

00:16:24.779 --> 00:16:26.659
and they were exactly what we needed.

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:31.899
We also had specific prayers at certain times about certain matters,

00:16:31.899 --> 00:16:34.740
and then 30 minutes later we received answers.

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.379
That definitely also was no coincidence.

00:16:37.379 --> 00:16:41.179
And then obviously getting the right approvals at just at the right time,

00:16:41.179 --> 00:16:45.179
despite objections, we know that there's not on us other than Jehovah

00:16:45.179 --> 00:16:46.860
that could have a hand in that.

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:51.419
So it's obvious that Satan has put everything he can in front of us,

00:16:51.419 --> 00:16:55.419
but Jehovah has provided every time at the right time.

00:16:55.419 --> 00:16:59.220
It's no coincidence that he's hand has been on this,

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:03.059
and there is no doubt that he wants people to know about his son, Jesus.

00:17:03.059 --> 00:17:08.099
Seeing the collaboration in our monthly meetings with the entire team,

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:10.660
where we have the World Headquarters Legal Department,

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.500
the World Headquarters Computer Department,

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.259
we have the purchasing department, we have design construction,

00:17:15.259 --> 00:17:18.859
we have the regional video teams, we have audio video services,

00:17:18.859 --> 00:17:22.859
all of these groups, along with the branch in Australasia,

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:26.619
working together for a common goal as a team.

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:32.609
It has been amazing and a very face strengthening experience.

00:17:32.609 --> 00:17:36.289
We were happy to share this update with you.

00:17:36.289 --> 00:17:38.529
But you might still be wondering,

00:17:38.529 --> 00:17:44.210
how are actors being prepared to reach our hearts through their performance?

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:50.769
How will the tone and filming style be selected to represent the gospel accounts?

00:17:50.769 --> 00:17:53.410
And maybe the biggest question you have is,

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:56.609
when will cameras start rolling?

00:17:56.690 --> 00:18:00.930
Stay tuned for a future update.

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:06.609
Imagine the powerful impact this video series will have on people.

00:18:06.609 --> 00:18:11.170
It will help you and me follow Jesus' footsteps closely.

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:14.210
It will help us draw closer to Jehovah,

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:18.130
whom Jesus perfectly imitated as a human.

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:22.049
But the benefits go far beyond you and me.

00:18:22.049 --> 00:18:24.769
As stated in the 2020 Annual Meeting,

00:18:24.769 --> 00:18:29.569
it is likely this series will be used to touch the hearts and minds

00:18:29.569 --> 00:18:35.250
of billions of resurrected ones in the coming new world.

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:42.849
Just think how this video series could help them learn about the example that Jesus set.

00:18:42.849 --> 00:18:49.410
Imagine how the visual portrayal of his warm humble and approachable personality

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:54.450
will help them to come to know Jehovah intimately.

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:59.170
How exactly will we use this new series to teach resurrected ones?

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:03.410
We will have to wait and see what Jehovah directs.

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:07.890
We are confident Jehovah is blessing this work.

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:11.250
And we will continue to look to Jehovah for direction

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:15.650
as we move ahead with the good news according to Jesus.
