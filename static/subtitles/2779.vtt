00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.690
It's a pleasure to relate to you two aspects of the teaching committee's work.

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:11.689
First, what does it take to put a regional convention together these days?

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:16.690
And second, what can we expect with regard to our midweek meetings?

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.690
The teaching committee is very grateful to every Bethel department.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:26.690
Each of you has contributed in some way to the spiritually festive events

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.690
that we enjoy at our conventions and our midweek meetings.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.689
Our conventions have come a long way since 1889.

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:42.689
But as you'll see, the improvements must be attributed to Jehovah.

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:50.409
This convention is so beautiful. It moves you to the core.

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.409
It's a very spiritually enriching experience to all of us.

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:58.409
You really see the governing body is caring for us and it's amazing.

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:02.409
This sentiment has been echoed for over a century.

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:06.409
How is it that year after year, people who have been in the truth for decades

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.409
can say that the most recent convention has surpassed all preceding ones.

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:17.409
And how do the brothers who prepare convention programs feel when they hear comments like that?

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.409
If this were merely the work of humans, they might feel like Caleb

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.409
as depicted in the 2017 regional conventions.

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.319
Thankfully, this is not the work of one man.

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:35.319
All praise goes to Jehovah for the timely conventions we enjoy.

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:39.319
His spirit is working through many willing volunteers.

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:43.319
Let's take a brief look at how our conventions are made.

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:47.319
It all begins with the theme.

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:51.319
As Brother Morris pointed out at the 2017 regional convention,

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:56.319
one word themes are determined years in advance.

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:01.319
That one word will guide those preparing the program.

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:04.319
Dramas, the most labor-intensive part of a program,

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:07.319
are developed five years in advance.

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:11.319
To prepare scripts, the teaching committee cooperates closely

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:17.319
with the writing department and working with a team known as the drama review group.

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.319
These experienced writers develop scriptural plots that teach lessons

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.319
in harmony with the convention theme.

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.319
Scripts are extensively researched,

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:33.319
and then sent to audio video services or AVS for production.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.319
All of this work has to begin early,

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.319
but how is the rest of a convention program developed?

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.319
Each year, the teaching committee carefully considers reports

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.319
from around the world from branch committees and world headquarters representatives,

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.319
often such reports indicate topics that could be addressed on a convention.

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:58.319
The teaching committee then selects a more specific theme that will serve as the basis

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.319
for addressing the needs of our worldwide brotherhood.

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.319
The theme is submitted to the entire governing body for approval.

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:12.319
Then, work begins on scripture themes for each day of the convention.

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.319
The Friday program lays the foundation.

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.319
What is the central truth under discussion?

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.319
Why should we give attention to it now?

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:29.319
Saturday brings admonition on personal conduct, field ministry, and family life.

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.319
Sunday often highlights what the Bible says about our future

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.319
and encouragement to maintain our hope.

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.319
Once this general framework is established,

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:44.319
talks are conceived, and additional lines of reasoning are chosen.

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.319
Attention is given to how to present ideas in a variety of ways.

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:55.319
Could a scriptural discussion reach the heart more effectively by means of an interview or a video?

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:01.319
This detailed sketch is all worked out before the teaching committee assigns teams of writers.

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:06.319
AVS collaborates with the writers in the development of brief videos.

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:12.319
The art department brainstorms ideas for convention branding.

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:20.319
The compiler follows the written content through 70 steps of research, fact checking, and proofreading.

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:29.319
Then, all of these outlines and scripts have to be translated into the 343 languages in which we hold regional conventions.

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:35.319
Translation services helps teams around the world to overcome challenges with the text.

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:44.319
Composers and arrangers make music tracks for the 18 songs that have been selected and the six music video preludes.

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:56.319
Music services also produces and records musical scores for the feature film, the audio drama, and some 40 other brief videos that are used on the program.

00:04:56.319 --> 00:05:00.319
But the teaching committee's involvement doesn't end here.

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:04.319
It provides direction regarding the assigning of speakers.

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:16.319
The design of sound systems, the securing of contracts for hotels and venues, the operation of convention departments, and the training of volunteers.

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:26.319
Thousands of willing workers are involved, each submitting to the inspired direction in God's word, and the influence of His Holy Spirit.

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:35.319
The benefits of such collaboration are felt not only at our annual conventions, but also at our weekly meetings.

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:41.319
It's been two years since the inception of our Christian life and ministry midweek meeting.

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:44.319
How have things been going on that front?

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:50.319
Everything got better, how the brothers and sisters feel about the meeting, and how they participate.

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:57.319
There are more videos at the meetings, so I feel closer to the worldwide brotherhood.

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:02.319
I really enjoy what it does for young ones, especially the two-minute parts.

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:07.319
You see young ones, even very young children, do a demonstration.

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:13.319
Instead of just underlining to prepare, now I get excited, looking for gems.

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:19.319
We really dig into a Bible account. I learn a whole lot more.

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:24.319
After the meeting, we enjoy discussing the gems we discovered.

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:30.319
Every meeting gives you something practical that you can apply the next weekend, right away.

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:37.319
Now, we don't just read the Bible as a family, but we pay more attention to Jehovah's qualities.

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:46.319
Young ones and new publishers are now less hesitant about sharing their beliefs at the door, because they simply do what they learned at the meetings.

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:54.319
Regarding production of the meeting, methods of Gilead school are employed in the approach to study.

00:06:54.319 --> 00:07:00.319
The Gilead approach to study considers context, explanation, and application.

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:07.319
Analyzing that context considers the time period, the historical setting, and the writer's intent.

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:15.319
These are built into the treasures from God's Word and the introductions to the Bible books videos we see at the midweek meetings.

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:26.319
The explanations for the verses are all based on the publications of the faithful discrete slave to ensure accuracy and correct understanding.

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:31.319
After all, at Gilead school, students aren't allowed to guess.

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:37.319
Once a scripture is explained accurately, then it can be applied properly.

00:07:37.319 --> 00:07:46.319
This method of context, explanation, followed by application, leads to meaningful Bible study.

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:53.319
The service committee office provides input on field service presentations and living as Christians.

00:07:53.319 --> 00:07:58.319
The writing department gives insight on how to feature our publications.

00:07:58.319 --> 00:08:01.319
What will change after January?

00:08:02.319 --> 00:08:12.319
As announced at the 2017 annual meeting, the public edition of the watchtower will be published three times a year instead of six.

00:08:12.319 --> 00:08:20.319
The same will be true for a wake. Also, specific monthly literature offers have been discontinued.

00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:25.319
Thus, we will enjoy some adjustments in our field service presentations.

00:08:25.319 --> 00:08:33.320
As you will see, the new focus will be not so much on publications, but on conversations.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:44.320
Clearly, the production of our midweek meetings and regional conventions takes a lot of planning and the cooperation of many willing workers in a variety of Bethel departments.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:49.320
But the positive effects are felt around the world.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:53.320
All I could say to Jehovah is thank you, Jehovah, for letting me be here.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.320
I feel very grateful to Jehovah for the meetings.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.320
Thank you, Jehovah.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.320
Sometimes Bethel receives letters that go something like this.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.320
Thank you for your tireless efforts.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:13.320
Actually, the brothers and sisters working on all these projects are tired.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:22.320
But they never tire of trusting in and cooperating with the one who truly is tireless, the source of all divine instruction, Jehovah.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:32.320
He alone can replace copper with gold so that each segment of divine education truly is the best ever.
