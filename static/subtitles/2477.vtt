00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:12.419
Hey Dad, here's my service report.

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.460
Good, you can put it on the bench.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:24.579
Okay. Dad, one can I be a publisher?

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.859
Ah, you have brought this up before.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.820
When we're together in the ministry, you do very well when speaking at the door.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.380
So then I can?

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.179
Not just yet. It's like getting a license to drive a car.

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:42.420
You have to be approved.

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.710
We can discuss how the elders are involved in approving you.

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:56.909
For now, let's see if you might qualify.

00:00:57.869 --> 00:01:01.229
First, do you obey Jehovah and your parents?

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:02.590
Yeah.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.989
Next, do you believe the Bible is Jehovah's Word?

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:09.549
And can you explain the basic teachings?

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.989
Yes.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.950
And are your friends Jehovah's friends?

00:01:18.269 --> 00:01:20.670
Caleb, you are already doing very well.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.909
One last thing.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.069
Do you want to be one of Jehovah's Witnesses in Bridge?

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:28.349
I do.

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:30.430
I think I'm ready.

00:01:31.629 --> 00:01:32.670
I think you are too.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.310
But we'll have to see what the elders decide.

00:01:36.269 --> 00:01:37.790
I'm so proud of you, son.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.109
Now, could you hand me that wrench?

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.989
Yeah.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.269
Thank you.
