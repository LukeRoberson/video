00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.079
What's wrong Caleb?

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:20.079
I can't find my airplane.

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:23.079
Hmm, I can see why.

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:26.079
Do you know what will help you to find your things?

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:27.079
What?

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:30.079
By keeping your room neat and clean.

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:33.079
Did you know Jehovah has a place for all his things?

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:34.079
Huh?

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.079
Like the planets.

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:37.079
They're always moving,

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.079
but Jehovah made them stay in their orbits

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.079
so they don't crash into each other.

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.079
Same with people.

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.079
We all look different on the outside.

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.079
But inside, Jehovah put all their bones and organs in the same place.

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.079
Imagine if your eyes were on the bottom of your feet.

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:03.250
Jehovah even keeps the animals clean.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.250
Look at these fish.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.250
They are cleaning the hippo.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.250
These birds help too.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.640
Do I have some animals that help me clean my room?

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.640
So do I sometimes.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.640
But that is why Jehovah gave you these.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.640
To pick things up with.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.640
When you keep your room clean,

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.640
you are making Jehovah happy.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.640
And Renault's, once your room is clean,

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.640
maybe you'll find your airplane.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:57.620
Okay, let's go outside and play.
