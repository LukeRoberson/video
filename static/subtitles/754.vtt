00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:04.169
He was a mighty man.

00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:08.169
He felt the heroes of the enemy.

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:11.169
He slayed a giant, he even killed a lion,

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:14.169
and his name was not David.

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:16.170
Who was he?

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.170
Open your Bibles with me, please, to the book of First Chronicles, chapter 11.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:27.250
First Chronicles, chapter 11, and verse 22.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:35.250
Beniah, the son of Jehoyada, was a courageous man who performed many exploits in Kabzeh.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.250
He struck down the two sons of Ariel of Moab,

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.250
and he descended into a water pit on a snowy day and killed a lion.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.250
He also struck down an Egyptian man of extraordinary size, five qubits tall.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.250
Though the Egyptian had a spear in his hand like the beam of loom workers,

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:05.250
he went against him with a rod and snatched the spear away from the Egyptian's hand and killed him with his own spear.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.659
He is Beniah.

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.659
Look at all we learn about him in these verses.

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.659
The qualities that Beniah displayed.

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.659
It tells us in verse 22, he was a courageous man.

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.659
He performed many exploits in Kabzeh.

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.659
Kabzeh is a small place on the very southern border of Judah.

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.659
It borders Adam, the middle of nowhere.

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.659
But Beniah worked there.

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.659
He was happy to be there.

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.659
It may be that that was his home, or it may be that that was his assignment.

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.659
No matter as obscure place as Kabzeh is, that's where he worked.

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:58.579
And the record says he performed many exploits courageously in Kabzeh.

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:01.579
He killed a lion, courage.

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:08.580
But do you notice he descended into a water pit and killed a lion.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.580
Courage descended into a water pit with a lion.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.580
There's only one coming out.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.580
And it was Beniah.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.580
He descended into a water pit on a snowy day.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.580
Wait for the sun to shine.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.580
He knew that was the day.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.580
Adverse conditions?

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.580
No matter.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.580
Beniah went in, and he slayed the lion.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.580
Look at verse 23, some more amazing qualities.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.580
He struck down the giant in Egyptian of extraordinary size.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.580
But notice, though the Egyptian had a spear in his hand like the beam of loom workers,

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.580
he, Beniah went against him with a rod.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.580
A rod, a stick.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.580
He didn't have the right equipment.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.580
Adaptability, commitment.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.860
And notice this, what does he do?

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:03.860
It says he went against him with a rod and snatched the spear away from the Egyptian's hand and killed him with his own spear.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:12.860
Courage, commitment, adaptability, resourcefulness, admirable, beneficial qualities.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.860
Are those the qualities that distinguished Beniah?

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.860
Not entirely.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.860
There was one quality that exceeded these.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.860
And that quality was loyalty.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.860
Tenacious adherence to the person of Jehovah.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.860
That's what the Bible record reveals about Beniah.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.860
Personal loyalty to Jehovah.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:44.699
There is a caution, though, with loyalty.

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:56.870
The demarcation between loyalty to Jehovah and loyalty to self can often be blurry.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:03.870
It hides under the inertia of imperfection and selfishness.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:11.870
That line of loyalty to Jehovah versus loyalty to self can become very difficult to see.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:23.870
In fact, loyalty to self can lie dormant within us until the circumstances arise and change, and then it can emerge.

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:35.500
And Beniah and his contemporaries provide for us a beautiful contrast in loyalty to Jehovah and loyalty to self.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.500
Think of Beniah. He lived in a very tumultuous time.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.500
David was a fugitive with his mighty men, one of them likely was Beniah and others.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.500
These men were comrades in arms running with David. They were a band of brothers.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.500
They were fiercely loyal to David and to be sure they were loyal to Jehovah as well.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:03.500
For example, among these three mighty men were three brothers, fleshly brothers.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.500
They're mentioned in verses 20 and 26.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:12.360
Joab, Abashai, and Azahel.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.360
Now consider when circumstances changed for the mighty men.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.360
When Saul died, and David now became king.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:29.360
In these changing circumstances, what happened to the mighty men?

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.360
Here's the contrast. Joab and Beniah.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.360
What happened to Joab?

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.360
Joab saw opportunity in changing circumstances.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:48.360
And his loyalty to Jehovah was eclipsed by his loyalty to himself.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:55.360
For instance, it was Joab who took matters into his own hands.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:01.360
And he killed Abner, with whom David had already concluded a covenant.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:08.360
He took matters into his own hands. Why? He wanted Abner's job.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:15.360
His selfish ambitions got the better of him, and they eclipsed his loyalty to Jehovah.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:22.360
Joab was a courageous man. He was resourceful. He was adaptable, admirable qualities.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:30.360
But in the absence of deep personal loyalty to Jehovah, they seem somehow tainted, don't they?

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.360
But consider Beniah in the same circumstances.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.360
Beniah had no part in these kind of intrigues, like Joab and his brothers.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.360
Beniah was loyal to Jehovah, and he was a loyal man to Jehovah's anointed one.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:50.360
David? And look at what we find in verses 24 and 25.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.360
Verses 24 and 25.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.360
These things, Beniah, the son of Jehovah did.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.360
And he had a reputation like that of the three mighty warriors.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:07.360
Although he was distinguished even more than the 30, he did not attain to the rank of the three.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:13.360
However, David appointed him over his own bodyguard.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:22.360
You see, in the same circumstances as Joab, Beniah's tenacious adherence to Jehovah,

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:28.360
his deep personal loyalty to Jehovah, safeguarded him in these circumstances.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:32.360
What did David see in Beniah?

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:41.360
David saw in Beniah what he himself exemplified, and that was deep and strong personal loyalty to Jehovah.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.360
You can see that in this verse in verse 25, can't you?

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.360
It says, however, David appointed him over his own bodyguard.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:57.360
David knew to assign someone to this very, very trusted position, head of his own bodyguard,

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:03.360
the man in that position, if he was loyal to Jehovah, he would be loyal to him.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.930
And that's what David saw in Beniah.

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:14.930
Then came another time of change, decades later, when David died and Solomon became king,

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:22.930
changed to circumstances, another time of opportunity, how would Beniah react?

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:29.930
The same way he always did, deep personal loyalty to Jehovah.

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:35.929
And it was Solomon when he became king, who rewarded Beniah.

00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:42.929
The son of David, Solomon, Jehovah's anointed, rewarded Beniah for his loyalty.

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:46.929
Turn with me, please, to Proverbs 19, verse 22.

00:08:46.929 --> 00:08:51.929
You see, Solomon knew something about loyalty.

00:08:51.929 --> 00:08:58.929
He was the son of David, and look at what he wrote about loyalty in Proverbs 19, verse 22.

00:08:58.929 --> 00:09:05.929
Solomon said, the desirable thing in man is his loyal love, his loyalty.

00:09:05.929 --> 00:09:11.929
That's what Jehovah looks for in us.

00:09:11.929 --> 00:09:17.929
So Beniah, he was indeed a mighty man, and he had beautiful qualities.

00:09:17.929 --> 00:09:21.929
Did they distinguish him? Not entirely.

00:09:21.929 --> 00:09:28.929
It was his deep personal loyalty to Jehovah, first and foremost, that distinguished him.

00:09:28.929 --> 00:09:37.929
And because of that deep personal loyalty to Jehovah, those qualities of Beniahs, they were beautiful.

00:09:37.929 --> 00:09:43.929
So daily cultivate your loyalty to God through prayer and study.

00:09:43.929 --> 00:09:46.929
That's been your training here.

00:09:46.929 --> 00:09:52.929
Use your training to develop your close personal loyalty to Jehovah.

00:09:52.929 --> 00:09:54.929
That's what Beniah did.

00:09:54.929 --> 00:09:58.929
Think of Beniah's training. He was the son of Jehojada.

00:09:58.929 --> 00:10:03.929
Jehojada was one of the chief Levitical priests in Israel.

00:10:03.929 --> 00:10:12.929
Beniah was raised with scrolls, not with swords, growing up the son of a priest that was his training.

00:10:13.929 --> 00:10:20.929
So like Beniah, be willing to do the work without the rank.

00:10:20.929 --> 00:10:24.929
Remember, loyalty is tested not when you are at ease.

00:10:24.929 --> 00:10:27.929
Loyalty is tested under adversity.

00:10:27.929 --> 00:10:30.929
So be careful in changing circumstances.

00:10:30.929 --> 00:10:32.929
Guard your hearts.

00:10:32.929 --> 00:10:39.529
Dear students, you all have beautiful qualities. We've seen them over the last five months.

00:10:39.529 --> 00:10:48.529
But may loyalty, may your deep personal loyalty to Jehovah, distinguish you.
