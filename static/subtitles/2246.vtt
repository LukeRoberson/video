00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:09.119
Hey there, you both landed jobs, eh?

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:12.699
Mom and dad will be proud.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.740
First, payday. What are you gonna do with all that money?

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.140
Hmm.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.940
Everybody needs it.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.039
Of course, every job has its difficulties and inconveniences.

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:29.460
But our hard-earned money can give us the power to buy and do lots of things.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.259
It can help us meet our physical needs.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.770
And can buy other things that we might want.

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:42.369
There are a few things you'll want to keep in mind about money.

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:45.369
Keep money in its place.

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:48.369
No, we're not talking about a physical place.

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:49.369
Like a bank.

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:51.369
Keep your priorities straight.

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:55.369
Be rich with God, the Bible says.

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:58.369
Take time to get to know him, to be his friend.

00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:01.369
He'll help you be content with what you have.

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:06.370
You'll be happier, whether you have a lot, or a little.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.370
And you'll make him happy, too.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.370
At Proverbs 23-5, the Bible says money can sprout wings like an eagle.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.370
And fly off into the sky.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.370
So it's important to learn now how to take care of your money.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.370
So that when you need it, it's there to take care of you.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.370
First, make a plan for your money.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.370
Otherwise, call a budget.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.370
Make a list of the things you need, and how much each cost.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.370
Good. Now, add a few things you want.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.370
And how much each costs.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.370
Add it all up.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.370
Now, compare that with how much money you'll earn each week.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:46.370
Hmm.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.370
Are these things so important that you need to spend most or all of your money on them?

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.370
You might need to put off some of those wants.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.370
Because it's also good to save some money.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.370
You know, put money away for a time when you'll need it.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.370
At Ecclesiastes 9-11.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.370
The Bible says time and unexpected events can overtake any of us.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.370
It's smart to have something set aside for yourself just in case you need it.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.370
Or to help someone else.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:23.370
Or you may need something that costs more than you can earn in a week or a month, even a year.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.370
So each week saves some money so that, wait, what?

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.370
Don't want to wait?

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.370
Ooh, credit.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:40.370
Well, you could do that, but credit carries a cost called interest, and it can really add up.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:47.370
When you lose track of the things you buy on credit, you can easily end up paying much more for everything you buy.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:55.370
Sometimes it can take years, and years, and years to pay off credit card debt.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.370
So have a plan for your money.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.370
Stay within your budget.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.370
Save for the unexpected, and avoid unnecessary debt.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.370
So you can spend more time getting to know God.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.370
Now that's how to manage your money.
