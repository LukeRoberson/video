00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.690
Our text for today deals with the quality of meekness.

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:11.689
Interestingly, one watched our article stated that meekness is actually a difficult quality

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:16.690
to cultivate. Difficult was certainly not impossible.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.690
We can say this because just think of the number of scriptures

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.690
that mention the quality of meekness as being essential for salvation.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:33.689
For example, Psalm 37 11, the meek will possess the earth.

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:38.689
Psalm 76 9, God will save all the meek of the earth.

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:45.689
Psalm 149 verse 4, Jehovah adorns the meek with salvation.

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:49.689
And then our text comments mentioned Zephaniah chapter 2 verse 3.

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:53.689
I invite you to take out your Bibles. Let's read that from God's words.

00:00:54.689 --> 00:01:04.500
Verse 3 says, Seek Jehovah, all you meek ones of the earth,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.500
who observe his righteous decrees, seek righteousness, seek meekness,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.500
probably you will be concealed on the day of Jehovah's anger.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.500
So all these scriptures show the connection between meekness and our salvation.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:31.500
So let's take a moment then and examine how this quality relates to each of us.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.500
The inside book defines meekness as a mildness of temper without haughtiness or vanity.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.500
It is the mental disposition that enables one to endure injury with patience

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.500
and without irritation, resentment, or vindictive retaliation.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.500
And as was mentioned earlier, how well this is illustrated in the Bible example of Moses.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.500
Let's go back to the Bible this time to Numbers chapter 12.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:08.060
We'll read a particular account and see how the Bible describes the man Moses.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.060
Numbers chapter 12 verse 1 says, Now Miriam and Aaron began to speak against Moses

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.060
because of the Cushite wife he had taken married, for he had taken a Cushite wife.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.060
They were saying, Is it only by Moses that Jehovah has spoken?

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.060
Has he not also spoken through us?

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.060
And Jehovah was listening.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.060
Now the man Moses was by far the meekest of all the men on the face of the earth.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.300
What we learned some interesting things in these verses to help establish

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:47.300
why Moses is described as the meekest of all the men on the face of the earth.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.300
Notice in verse 1, Miriam and Aaron, Moses older brother and sister,

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.300
it says they began to speak against Moses.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.300
They're speaking against him meant they were likely spreading their complaints about Moses

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.300
throughout the Israelite camp.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.300
Miriam had a measure of influence in the camp.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.300
She was a prophetess.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.300
The Bible says she led the woman and singing and dancing when Jehovah defeated Pharaoh

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.300
in the Egyptians at the Red Sea.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:24.300
So now that Moses' wife, Zapura, was going to rejoin them in the wilderness,

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:31.300
is it possible that Miriam may have feared that she would no longer be the leading lady in the camp?

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:38.300
Perhaps she felt that she would lose some of her prominence to Moses' wife, a non-Israelite at that.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.300
Now all those apura was not an Israelite.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:48.300
When we look at Exodus chapter 4, it shows that she demonstrated her willingness to adhere to God's laws.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:57.300
So the root of Miriam's complaints and murmuring had nothing to do with true worship or the protection of God's people.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:05.300
Instead, the root cause appears to be jealousy, an improper desire for authority and recognition.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:13.300
We, along with our brother Aaron, use this as an excuse to murmur against Moses.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:20.300
But if we look back in this account, how is the meekness of Moses made apparent?

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.300
Well, despite the resentment and murmuring on the part of Miriam and Aaron,

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.300
Moses patiently and quietly endured the abuse.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:36.300
And if we look in verse 2, Moses did not have to defend himself because Jehovah was listening.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.300
And he took action.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.300
If you look in verses 6 through 8, Jehovah rebukes Miriam and Aaron.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:50.300
And Miriam, evidently as the apparent instigator, is stricken with leprosy.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.300
And when this happens, if you look in verses 11 and 12, how interesting,

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00.300
Aaron asked Moses to intercede in her behalf.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.300
Now for just a moment, let's just put ourselves in Moses' sandals.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.300
Could we blame Moses if he were upset?

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.300
Here it is, his older siblings of disrespected Jehovah.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.300
They've disrespected Moses as God's representative.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:23.300
And now they're talking about Moses' wife, even when there was no just cause to do so.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.300
So, could Miriam or could Moses have now felt about Miriam?

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.300
You know what? You had this coming to you.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.300
You brought this upon yourself.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.300
You are getting exactly what you deserve.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.300
Well, even though Moses could have been justified.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.300
When he was given the opportunity, notice what he does in verse 13.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.300
He begins to cry out to Jehovah saying,

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.300
Oh, God, please heal her, please.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:58.839
What a beautiful example of meekness displayed by Moses.

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:04.120
Now, how can his example benefit us?

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.120
Well, think about this.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.120
When is the next time you and I might need to show meekness?

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.589
Could it be later today?

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:19.589
If we find that our work is being delayed by someone else or another department?

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:26.589
Could it be at our meeting this week if we receive counsel on a meeting part?

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:34.589
Could it be if we find that we've lost or that we've been passed over for a privilege of service?

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:39.589
You see, due to our imperfect state, any number of circumstances could arise

00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:45.589
where we might need to look back when Moses' example of displaying meekness.

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:53.220
Now, for just a moment, let's go back to Zephaniah chapter 2, verse 3.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:59.220
If you notice in verse 3, we are told to seek meekness.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.220
That means that none of us are born with this quality,

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:11.220
so we have to seek it by asking, by searching, by praying for Jehovah's help to exercise restraint

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:17.220
and represent him properly, even under difficult circumstances.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.220
Perhaps we've had the experience in the ministry where we've been ridiculed

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:27.220
or we've encountered unreasonable individuals who state all sorts of misconceptions about Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:31.220
And we've heard them. We don't believe in Jesus. We break up families.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.220
We don't believe in helping the community.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:37.220
And maybe when we hear them, it may bother us.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.220
Frankly, it may even upset us.

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:43.220
To the point where we just feel we need to give a reply.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:48.220
We must defend ourselves. We have to get the last word in in order to set the household

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.220
to straight on our beliefs.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:08:00.220
But might that be the very time to seek meekness, to pray to Jehovah to exercise restraint?

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:03.220
Or perhaps on a more personal level.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:06.220
It may be that we experience injustice.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:10.220
Perhaps we have a misunderstanding with a member of our family here

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:13.220
and brother and sister in the congregation.

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:19.220
And whatever the issue is, we may have a legitimate complaint.

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:23.220
But isn't it true if we're not careful?

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:26.220
If we don't seek meekness.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:30.220
If we don't seek to resolve the matter in a spirit of meekness,

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:39.220
well, wouldn't you agree that voicing our legitimate complaint could very easily cross the line into murmuring?

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.220
And we know how Jehovah feels about that.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:46.220
So certainly, we would never want to do anything to disappoint them.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:50.220
Moses was meek, the meekest man who ever lived.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:56.220
But even he reached a point on one occasion where he did not show meekness and exercise restraint.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.220
And he suffered the consequences.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:03.220
So if you and I are to continue to draw close to God and remain acceptable to him,

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:14.220
we must strive to uproot any traces of pride, jealousy, ambition, or vindictiveness that we may see in ourselves.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.220
Yes, Jehovah loves those who are meek.

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:23.220
Those who are meek will inherit salvation.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:29.220
So may each of us continue to seek this quality by asking, praying,

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:36.220
and then cultivating a submissive attitude that will allow us to be among the meek who will inherit the earth.
