00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:04.809
Well, here's the question we want to ask this morning.

00:00:04.809 --> 00:00:09.410
Is it actually possible to speed up the day of Jehovah?

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:17.289
Well, if we look at our text this morning in 2 Peter chapter 3, and verse 11, we've had

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:23.829
that red for us, so we know that expression at the end that we should consider what sort

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:29.890
of people you ought to be in holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:36.890
But then it goes on to say, as you await and keep close in mind the presence of the day

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.049
of Jehovah.

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:44.689
Well now if you look at the footnote on this expression in verse 12, you'll notice that

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:52.890
the expression keep close in mind literally means to speed up the day of Jehovah.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.570
Well now how can we do that?

00:00:55.049 --> 00:01:01.369
Well, it's true, we cannot bring the day forward of Jehovah even one day, nor can we

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:03.969
move it back even one day.

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:05.769
That is not within our power.

00:01:05.769 --> 00:01:07.689
That day is set.

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:14.890
But how can we then speed up the day of Jehovah as it says there in verse 12?

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.689
Well we keep that day close in our mind.

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.450
We never let it be out of our sight.

00:01:21.489 --> 00:01:26.569
As the footnote also says, we eagerly desire it.

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:33.489
Well now if we're persons like that, Peter says that we're going to be busy in deeds of

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:35.370
godly devotion.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.290
Well now just as a quick reminder, what is godly devotion?

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.370
Well just looking at our new world translation glossary, here's the definition.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:52.370
Well what do we get from that definition?

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.370
You notice reverence, worship, service?

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.370
You see godly devotion is not passive, it's active.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.370
It's reflected in action and inactivity.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.370
Well that's why the Apostle Peter used the expression in verse 11 deeds.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.370
Well what are some of the ways that we demonstrate this quality?

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.370
Well as some of them are just very small, for example, what about hospitality?

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:29.370
In 1 Peter chapter 4 and verse 9, when the Apostle Peter wrote his first letter,

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.370
he said, be hospitable to one another without grumbling.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.370
Well there are so many opportunities for us to imitate Jehovah and be hospitable to share

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:48.370
with others according to their needs and this really is an expression not only for another person,

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.370
but it's an expression of our love for Jehovah, our desire to want to imitate him.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:01.370
Well we all acknowledge that, but here's the question, when was the last time that you

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:08.370
acted hospitably or when was the last time I acted hospitably?

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.370
You see, it's not enough just to love the quality of hospitality.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.370
If we're going to have deeds of godly devotion, we're going to have to practice it.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.370
Here's another one, what about helping the elderly that are in our midst?

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.370
You know our elderly brothers need help, they need help to get to the meetings,

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.370
they need help to get out in the field ministry.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.370
Some of them are confined to their homes, well if that's the case,

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:43.370
and they may need help from younger ones to assist them with shopping or doing errands

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.370
or just doing some chore around the house.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.370
Well that's something that has been mentioned in many Watchtower articles.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:58.370
It's been mentioned at many conventions and assemblies, it's been mentioned at many congregation meetings,

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.370
but now here's a question.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.370
When was the last time that you did something for an elderly brother or sister?

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.370
Or when was the last time I did?

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:15.370
You see, we need to think about not just loving these ideas, but what are we doing to really help?

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.370
See that's showing deeds of godly devotion.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.370
Well of course we also have to think about the more major things.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.370
What about attending our congregation meetings?

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:33.370
Hebrews chapter 10 verses 23 to 25, that scripture that we quote so many times

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.370
says that we should not forsake our meeting together,

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.370
but it goes on to say that we should encourage one another.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.370
So it's not enough just to be at the meeting,

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.370
when we're there we want to reach out and do everything that we can to encourage our brothers

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.370
and really participate in the meeting.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.370
You see, godly devotion is not passive, it's active.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.370
And so what sort of persons ought we to be when we're at the meeting?

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:08.370
Well, we know we want to be active, fully involved with the program.

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:14.370
But now of course what's the most important way that we exercise these deeds of godly devotion?

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:20.370
Well you'll remember that the Apostle Paul in 1 Timothy chapter 3 and verse 16

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.370
referred to the sacred secret of godly devotion.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.370
And he showed there that Jesus really was that secret.

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:35.370
You see, he was the one who demonstrated godly devotion in a perfect sense.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:44.370
Now Paul in that verse, 1 Timothy 3, 16 went on to say that Jesus was preached among the nations.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.370
Well then that really is a vital part of our deeds of godly devotion.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:55.370
Preaching about Christ Jesus, His kingdom and everything that will be accomplished.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:03.370
But brothers, how much incentive we have today to be involved fully in our preaching work?

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.370
We have tools today like we have never had before.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:12.370
You know, over the summer as I was attending a number of different regional conventions

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:17.370
and different parts of the world, I enjoyed so much, no doubt just as you have,

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.370
using the JW Library app.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:27.370
And downloading the Why Study the Bible video in a number of different languages.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.370
We had one real interesting experience when we were in Europe.

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:37.370
We got into a taxi with a driver from Africa and right away we asked him what his language was.

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.370
Well he told us it was a language not familiar to us at all.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:48.370
But while he was driving, we managed to download the Why Study the Bible video.

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:52.370
And it automatically began to play as we were in the car.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.370
Well as soon as the man heard it, he started shouting, what's happening?

00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:02.370
What's happening? I think he thought he was hearing a voice from heaven when he heard his own language in the taxi.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:06.370
But we reassured him that that was not the case.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:12.370
But he was so moved. He almost didn't want to take the fare if you can imagine.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.370
And initially he had been quite unfriendly.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:21.370
But when he saw what was available on our website, he was deeply moved.

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.370
Well maybe you've had a similar experience.

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:30.370
Just as a note of future reference, probably not a good idea to play the video when someone's driving.

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:35.370
Well if we have real godly devotion that's active.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:40.370
We're going to be busy in doing deeds of godly devotion.

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:45.370
You know there's an old saying that says, time flies when you're having fun.

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:49.370
Well you know even scientists acknowledge that there's truth in that.

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:58.370
A study that was published in the year 2012 in the journal Psychological Science said this.

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:03.370
Although we tend to believe that time flies when we're having a good time.

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:11.370
These studies indicate that what it is about the enjoyable time that causes it to go by more quickly.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:19.370
It seems to be the goal pursuit or achievement directed action we're engaged in that matters.

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:24.370
Just being content or satisfied may not make time fly.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:30.370
But being excited or actively pursuing a desired object can.

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:31.370
Isn't that interesting?

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:38.370
When of where the sort of persons that are busy with holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion.

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:43.370
Reaching out for that most important goal of everlasting life.

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:50.370
We will speed up the coming of the day of Jehovah in our hearts and our minds.
