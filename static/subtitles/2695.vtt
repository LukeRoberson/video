00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:09.750
So, how can we benefit from knowing that Jehovah sees all the good that we do?

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.949
Our friends, our workmates and family, they see some of the good that we do.

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:21.570
But no friend relative or even mate can see all the good that we do, but Jehovah does.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.390
Say when we defend a friend who isn't there to defend themselves or we resisted

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.789
temptation or our prayers for others that only Jehovah knows about.

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.630
Unfortunately, we don't have to report every good deed to Jehovah, where list in our prayers

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.750
at night, here's all the good things that we did that day, we're content with knowing

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.829
that Jehovah saw them all and was pleased with us.

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:53.630
Jesus was content with knowing that Jehovah saw and was pleased with what He was doing.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:01:05.280
If we look at John 8 and verse 29, he says, and the one who sent me is with me, he did

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.200
not abandon me to myself because I always do the things pleasing to him.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.200
So Jesus knew that He was not alone in seeing the good things that He was doing.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.439
Even if He was falsely accused or as a poser's light about Him, He knew that He was doing

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.560
the things that we're pleasing to Jehovah.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.799
What lesson is there for us in that?

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.560
It's very comforting.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:37.930
Jehovah sees all the good that we do and nothing good that we do is missed by Him.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:44.609
Well, how can knowing that Jehovah sees all the good that we do help us when we're falsely

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:47.170
accused?

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.569
This is what you said, no, I didn't say that.

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:56.450
I just wish He had a recording or He could go back in time.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.090
But sometimes, of course, it doesn't make a difference no matter what you say.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.129
You think of how Maphibosheth may have felt when slandered by Zyba to King David.

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:11.930
Do you think Maphibosheth wished He had an eyewitness or a recording?

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.129
You know, to kind of illustrate the power of an eyewitness, I want you to imagine a traffic

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:17.530
accident.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.469
You're just sitting at a stop sign and another car comes around the corner and runs

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:24.469
right into you.

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:29.629
Now when the police come, shockingly, the person who ran into you says, you ran into them

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.370
and the police believe them.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.750
You take the matter to court.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.669
The judge listens as the other person testifies in detail how you ran into them.

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:49.870
But before you can say anything, the judge says, no, that is not what happened.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:56.949
I was walking on the sidewalk that day and I saw the whole thing.

00:02:56.949 --> 00:03:02.789
Now who would imagine that the judge in your case actually was an eyewitness?

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:06.270
You say to yourself, well, if I had known that, I wouldn't have been so worried about what

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.349
was going to happen in court today.

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:14.229
Now while it's extremely unlikely that you're going to go to court and the judge is going

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:19.590
to be an eyewitness for you, but this does illustrate the peace of mind that we can have

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.789
in knowing that Jehovah is an eyewitness to all that happens.

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:31.270
So the lesson for us, when we're falsely accused, it is of great comfort for us to know that

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:38.520
Jehovah was there that day and saw the whole thing.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.360
Now knowing that Jehovah sees all the good that we do can also help us avoid putting on a

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.360
pretense.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.840
Jehovah is not fooled by people who do good deeds just to be seen by others.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.759
The Pharisees of Jesus' day, they just loved to put on a pretense of righteousness.

00:03:56.759 --> 00:04:01.120
And Jesus tells an illustration that really exemplified that point.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:16.180
If we go to Luke chapter 18 and verses 9 through 14, that's Luke 18 verses 9 through 14.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.579
As he also told this illustration to some who trusted in their own righteousness and who

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:27.060
considered others as nothing, two men went up into the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.620
and the other a tax collector.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.660
The Pharisees stood and began to pray these things to himself, oh God, I thank you that

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.139
I'm not like everyone else, extortioners and unrighteous and adulterers, or even like

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:43.420
this tax collector.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:49.540
I fast twice a week, I give the tenth of all things I acquire.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:55.100
But the tax collector, standing at a distance, was not willing even to raise his eyes

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:02.620
heavenward, but kept beating his chest saying, oh God, be gracious to me, a sinner.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.300
I tell you, this man went down to his home and proved more righteous than that Pharisee,

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.500
because everyone who exalts himself will be humiliated, but whoever humbles himself

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.769
will be exalted.

00:05:15.769 --> 00:05:22.449
So the Pharisee was trying to impress Jehovah with listing all of his so-called good deeds.

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:27.329
And it's true, Jehovah sees all the good that we do, but he also sees the motive behind

00:05:27.329 --> 00:05:28.329
it.

00:05:28.329 --> 00:05:34.370
We never want to fool ourselves that simply doing good things that others can see does

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.290
not hide who we really are from Jehovah.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:45.689
So the lesson for us is the good things that we do are because we love Jehovah, not because

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:51.149
we want praise or credit from others.

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:56.949
Knowing that Jehovah sees all the good that we do also makes us comfortable with Jehovah

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:02.589
as our judge, we're all going to be judged by Jehovah.

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:09.910
Eventually, we'll all be judged as either worthy of life or judged as worthy of death.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.870
While comforting it is to know that Jehovah, the one who's going to make that life or

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:19.870
death decision is someone who knows everything about us.

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:25.149
Like that judge we mentioned in the illustration earlier, you didn't even have to testify.

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:30.839
The judge already knew exactly what had happened.

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:35.079
Have you ever thought after someone compliments you or says you're great or you did something

00:06:35.079 --> 00:06:36.079
wonderful?

00:06:36.079 --> 00:06:40.720
You think to yourself, yeah, but you really don't know me that well.

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:46.759
On the other hand, there are people who know you really well.

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:48.399
They've known you for many years.

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:54.000
They've been through some good times and some bad times with you, yet they still love

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.759
you.

00:06:55.759 --> 00:07:02.199
And you think to yourself, wow, with all they know about me and all that we've been through,

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:04.040
they still love me.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.839
That's amazing.

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:10.319
Jehovah knows everything about us.

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:16.360
Even if we've made mistakes or sins, if we repent and we continue to try to do what

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.000
is right, he still loves us.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.319
Now I have no doubt that as you take some time to meditate on our texts for today, you

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:30.899
could come up with many more lessons to apply in our day-to-day lives by knowing that

00:07:30.899 --> 00:07:36.199
Jehovah is watching and seeing all the good that we do.

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:41.959
He knows we read earlier, Jesus said that Jehovah had not left him to himself.

00:07:41.959 --> 00:07:45.480
And Jehovah has not left us to ourselves.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:55.279
He is with us, he sees us, he knows us, and he loves us for all the good that we do.
