00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.860
Our theme this month is keep seeking great things for Jehovah.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:13.539
It's based on some powerful advice that Jehovah gave to a man named Beric.

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:15.300
Who was Beric?

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.780
What can his example teach us?

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.219
And how can the Divine Council he received help us today?

00:00:22.219 --> 00:00:24.379
Let's find out.

00:00:24.379 --> 00:00:27.140
Beric was a faithful servant of Jehovah.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.100
He appears in the Bible book of Jeremiah about the year 625 BCE.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:41.060
Let's start our journey by reading Jeremiah chapter 45, verse 1.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.740
This is the word that Jeremiah, the prophet, spoke to Beric, the Son of Nariah when he

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:53.340
wrote in a book, these words dictated by Jeremiah in the fourth year of Jehoyakim, Son of

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.460
Josiah, the King of Judah.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.700
Beric served as Jeremiah's personal secretary.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.260
The two worked closely together for some 18 years, including after the destruction of

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.780
Jerusalem in 607 BCE.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.140
That was certainly a special privilege of service during a very challenging time.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.060
But why did Jeremiah need an assistant?

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.180
For some 23 years, Jeremiah had been conveying a message of judgment and hope to God's people

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.739
in Judah.

00:01:28.739 --> 00:01:35.219
In the year 625 BCE, it seems that Jeremiah had been barred from the temple area where

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:37.659
Jehovah's message was to be read.

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:44.700
At that time, Jehovah asked Jeremiah to write his warnings in a scroll.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.420
That's where Beric, a scribe or a secretary, comes into the picture.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.019
He wrote in a scroll all the words that Jehovah had spoken through Jeremiah up until that

00:01:55.019 --> 00:01:58.939
time, 23 years worth.

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.420
The following year, when the time came for the contents of that scroll to be read aloud

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.939
in the temple courtyard, Jeremiah asked Beric to deliver the message.

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:12.620
Again, Beric did just so.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.419
What happened next?

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:21.060
When the princes of Judah heard what Beric had done, they wanted to hear the message firsthand.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.259
So Beric read it out loud again.

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:31.060
As soon as they heard it, the account says, they looked at one another in dread.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.500
They told Beric, we must certainly tell the king all these words.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.460
Before doing so, they warned Beric, go and hide yourselves.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.340
Do and Jeremiah, and do not let anyone know where you are.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.819
Wicked King Jehovahic him was hot with anger.

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:57.780
He burned the scroll and ordered that Jeremiah and Beric be arrested.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.060
Now let's pause and think.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.780
From what we've considered so far, what can we learn from Beric?

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.460
First, he was humble.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.419
Many scholars believe that he belonged to a prominent scribal family.

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:19.460
Yet when the invitation came to help Jeremiah, Beric proceeded to do according to all that

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.060
Jeremiah the prophet had commanded him.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:30.219
Like you, brothers and sisters, Beric was happy to support Jehovah's work and to do whatever

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:32.300
was asked of him.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.939
He did not let his family status or personal goals distract him.

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:44.580
As he was humble, he put Jehovah's will first in his life.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.900
Beric also demonstrated endurance.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:54.979
Do you think putting 23 years worth of divine messages in writing took some time?

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:56.379
Of course.

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:01.139
Beric didn't have a modern tool such as a smartphone tablet or computer.

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:05.020
It was a lot of manual work.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:12.180
And imagine Beric's shock when the king burned up the first scroll.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.699
That was Jehovah's message.

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:19.139
That was the scroll that Beric had written by hand.

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:23.379
Hours of work up in smoke.

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:27.899
Jeremiah chapter 36 verse 32 says,

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:33.339
Jeremiah then took another scroll and gave it to Beric.

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:39.019
And at Jeremiah's dictation, he wrote on it all the words of the scroll that King Jehoya

00:04:39.019 --> 00:04:47.060
came of Judah had burned in the fire and many more words like those were at it.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:55.220
Like Beric, we too need endurance to stick to our sacred work when there are challenges.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.180
Number two, Beric's courage.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.180
He must have known how dangerous it would be to work with Jeremiah.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:09.459
Earlier the same king that burned up the scroll killed another prophet of Jehovah, Eurijah,

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:11.860
by the sword.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:17.779
But Beric fearlessly used his professional skills and contacts to support Jehovah's

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:18.779
prophet.

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:26.379
There's so much we can learn from this God-fearing man who demonstrated humility, endurance,

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:28.100
and courage.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:33.259
Jehovah loved Beric and so do we.

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:39.259
Of course, Beric, like us, confronted negative thoughts and feelings.

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:43.100
There was one challenge that could have cost him dearly.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.819
What was it?

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:50.220
Let's continue the reading in Jeremiah chapter 45 verses 2 and 3.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:55.060
And please note, Jehovah's personal interest in Beric.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.500
Jeremiah 45, 2 and 3 says.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:04.579
This is what Jehovah, the God of Israel, says concerning you, Beric.

00:06:04.579 --> 00:06:11.220
You have said, whoa to me, for Jehovah has added grief to my pain.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:18.180
I am weary from my groaning and I have found no resting place.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.459
Why was Beric feeling like that?

00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:26.220
Was he getting tired of his assignment or perhaps the circumstances in which he had

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.980
to perform it?

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.779
Let's keep reading verses 4 and 5.

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:36.420
You should say to him, this is what Jehovah says.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:42.420
Look, what I have built up, I am tearing down.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:48.019
And what I have planted, I am uprooting the entire land.

00:06:48.019 --> 00:06:51.819
But you are seeking great things for yourself.

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:54.500
Stop seeking such things.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.459
For I am about to bring a calamity on all flesh to Claire's Jehovah.

00:06:59.459 --> 00:07:07.379
And wherever you may go, I will grant you your life as a spoil.

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:12.060
What reason did Jehovah give for Beric's feelings?

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:17.220
It was not the assignment itself or even his circumstances.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:22.660
In verse 5, Jehovah said, you are seeking great things for yourself.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.459
Think about that.

00:07:24.459 --> 00:07:30.660
It was Beric's own view of what seemed great or most important.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:36.379
For a time he was focused on seeking great things for himself.

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:39.899
But do you think those great things could have been?

00:07:39.899 --> 00:07:43.500
Was it a desire for fame or prestige?

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:48.540
Was he sensing that his support for God's prophet was putting at risk his position and

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.139
career?

00:07:50.139 --> 00:07:56.060
Or did the great things have to do with getting more money, property or some material possessions?

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.579
We don't know.

00:07:57.579 --> 00:08:05.540
But Beric knew what they were, and Jehovah's Council was clear, stop seeking such things.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:10.259
It seems Beric took Jehovah's Council to heart.

00:08:10.259 --> 00:08:15.060
I imagine him reasoning something like this.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:20.420
Jehovah knows my thoughts and feelings.

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:24.740
Have I really been seeking great things for myself?

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:25.740
It's true.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.339
Jehovah's always right.

00:08:28.339 --> 00:08:33.779
My desires got the better of me, and I was so distressed.

00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:41.019
But Jehovah's kindly telling me, Beric, be realistic, a divine judgment is coming.

00:08:41.019 --> 00:08:46.019
Everything that seems so stable will be uprooted.

00:08:46.019 --> 00:08:52.259
Material things, property, money or a prominent career, it's all temporary.

00:08:52.259 --> 00:08:56.019
Seeking those things is dangerous.

00:08:56.019 --> 00:09:01.700
Jehovah wants me and others to survive the common calamity.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.299
That's what I want.

00:09:04.299 --> 00:09:09.539
I need to get back to seeking great things for Jehovah.

00:09:09.539 --> 00:09:15.700
Well, that's just a possibility of how Beric might have been thinking.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:19.139
But did he accept and follow the council?

00:09:19.139 --> 00:09:20.860
Yes.

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:27.139
During the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem about 17 years later, Beric appears again in the

00:09:27.139 --> 00:09:30.980
inspired record supporting Jeremiah.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:36.980
And though many others died during the catastrophic destruction of Jerusalem, Beric and Jeremiah

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.100
survived.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:47.700
Beric's humble response to Jehovah's Council saved his life and such a response to divine

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:52.259
council can do the same for us.

00:09:52.259 --> 00:09:56.940
I'm sure as you think more about Beric, you'll see other ways we can benefit from his

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:03.259
example, but let's briefly discuss one particular challenge that some of us might be facing

00:10:03.259 --> 00:10:07.860
right now and how Beric's experience can help.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.820
The challenge?

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:15.740
Being balanced while providing materially for ourselves and our families.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:21.899
In today's world, many people are seeking great things for themselves as they pursue

00:10:21.899 --> 00:10:25.940
secular education and secular work.

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:31.340
Many believe that the key to success and the key to there and their family's happiness

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:39.940
involves money and getting more material things or a resting place in this system of things.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:43.899
Such thinking could influence us.

00:10:43.899 --> 00:10:47.980
If you're a family head, consider Chibisa.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:52.700
Chibisa brother in Malawi, who along with his wife and seven children, were doing well

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.500
spiritually.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:59.100
However, at one point, they faced financial problems.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:03.419
At times, there was not enough money to buy food for each day.

00:11:03.419 --> 00:11:05.899
How stressful.

00:11:05.899 --> 00:11:11.100
Like many others, Chibisa decided to go to South Africa to find work.

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.659
That was a personal decision.

00:11:13.659 --> 00:11:16.059
But was it wise?

00:11:16.059 --> 00:11:19.500
Looking back, Chibisa said this.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:24.139
This affected me spiritually because I did not know the language.

00:11:24.139 --> 00:11:28.539
I was unable to preach and I did not benefit from the meetings.

00:11:28.539 --> 00:11:34.820
Being so far from my family caused me to neglect my responsibility as a family head.

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:42.340
As a result, my family grew weak spiritually and we all missed each other very much.

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:46.340
I realized that I had made a wrong decision going abroad.

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:51.950
My conscience started to trouble me greatly.

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:58.389
You parents must also make personal decisions about secular education for your children.

00:11:58.389 --> 00:12:02.029
Naturally, you want them to get a good education.

00:12:02.029 --> 00:12:06.230
But you have to think carefully about potential dangers.

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:12.429
For example, in some countries, parents send their young children away to boarding schools.

00:12:12.429 --> 00:12:18.710
The March 15, 1997 issue of the watchtower discussed the scriptural principles involved

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:22.950
and related a number of experiences highlighting the dangers.

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:28.269
A brother named Clement said that before going away to boarding school, he loved the truth

00:12:28.269 --> 00:12:34.070
and enjoyed participating in the ministry in family worship and at meetings.

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:35.909
However, he said,

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:42.230
Once I went into boarding school at the age of 14, I left the truth completely.

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:46.990
Throughout the five years I spent in boarding school, I never attended meetings.

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:54.200
As a result of bad company, I got involved with drugs, smoking, and heavy drinking.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.799
Let's consider one more situation.

00:12:56.799 --> 00:13:04.639
You younger Christians approaching adulthood must make decisions involving education and employment.

00:13:04.679 --> 00:13:11.200
There may be many choices, but which ones will help you live up to your dedication to Jehovah?

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.360
One sister said this.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:19.840
As a baptized witness, I had read and heard about the dangers of pursuing university education,

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.080
but I dismissed such warnings.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:27.120
I thought that counsel did not apply to me.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:32.279
Well, our sister made her personal choice in the matter, but was it a wise one?

00:13:32.279 --> 00:13:34.000
She continues.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:41.360
Studying for my courses took so much time and effort that I was too busy to linger in prayer

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:47.200
to Jehovah the way I used to, too exhausted to enjoy Bible discussions with others,

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.879
and too tired to prepare well for the meetings.

00:13:50.879 --> 00:13:56.240
Thankfully, once I realized that being immersed in higher education was damaging my relationship

00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:02.879
with Jehovah, I knew I had to stop and I did.

00:14:02.879 --> 00:14:07.039
Of what do these real life examples remind us?

00:14:07.039 --> 00:14:13.919
In Satan's system of things, we will face challenges that test our determination to put

00:14:13.919 --> 00:14:16.799
Jehovah's will first in our lives.

00:14:16.799 --> 00:14:21.440
Like Barrick, personal desires could distract us.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:28.480
If that ever happens, we need to take quick action to correct our viewpoint as did Barrick.

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:33.279
Happily, through the Bible and spiritual instruction from the faithful slave,

00:14:33.279 --> 00:14:37.440
Jehovah helps us make better choices in personal areas of life,

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:41.200
such as those involving secular education and secular work.

00:14:42.159 --> 00:14:45.200
At Psalm 32.8, he promises,

00:14:47.039 --> 00:14:51.279
I will give you insight and instruct you in the way you should go.

00:14:52.159 --> 00:14:56.159
I will give you advice with my eye upon you.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:02.399
We are wise to seek out such advice by doing research,

00:15:02.399 --> 00:15:07.039
by talking to mature Christians, and then applying such counsel.

00:15:07.039 --> 00:15:13.440
Chabisa did that after moving to South Africa, his conscience started bothering him,

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.480
and he remembered the example of Barrick.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.320
Chabisa said this,

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:23.519
Barrick may have wanted to pursue material riches as I had.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.480
When he was helped, he returned.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:32.960
I decided then to put Jehovah in first place instead of searching for material things,

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.440
so I started to make changes to go home and help my family spiritually.

00:15:38.159 --> 00:15:44.720
When I left South Africa and reached the border of Malawi, I felt great happiness in my heart,

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.559
and I am still happy, studying the Bible has helped me.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.000
We still encounter financial problems,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.240
but I remember that in Satan's world,

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:57.440
there is nowhere we can go and have no problems.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.879
My family is progressing spiritually,

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:08.799
and this makes me very happy because my relationship with Jehovah is strong.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:15.759
Like Barrick, Chabisa was humble and courageous,

00:16:16.639 --> 00:16:21.519
and we know those same qualities characterize you, brothers and sisters.

00:16:22.559 --> 00:16:29.039
So when Jehovah, our loving father, gives us timely advice as he did to his close friend, Barrick,

00:16:29.759 --> 00:16:35.679
let's take it to heart. Let's do whatever it takes to make sure we and our families

00:16:35.679 --> 00:16:39.120
continue seeking first the kingdom and God's righteousness.

00:16:39.919 --> 00:16:44.799
And never forget, as we continue to seek great things for Jehovah,

00:16:45.519 --> 00:16:49.120
He'll continue to do great things for us and our families.

00:16:49.679 --> 00:16:56.879
Yes, it's His blessing that makes us truly rich, and He adds no pain with it.
