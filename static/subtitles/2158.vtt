00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:16.199
When you were younger, life seemed so simple, you did your best to do what's right, giving answers and preaching the good news.

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:30.199
You would pray each and every night, but as you got older with this world trying to mold you, suddenly it was not so easy to be knocking on those doors.

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:38.200
But as you get taller, smarter, trying to work harder, never let go of Jehovah.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.200
The best is still in store.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:51.929
You have a treasured place in Jehovah's house, it'll help you out.

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:57.929
And you have so much to offer, so much to do.

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:16.409
Jehovah sees your faith knowing, treasures you.

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:26.299
Like all the trials have just begun, growing anxious from all of us.

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.299
Talk to God, He always listens.

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:37.299
And as you get wiser, find the ways you can apply the truth in your life.

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:48.299
Feel the joy of sacrifice, and as you get taller, smarter, trying to work harder, never let go of Jehovah.

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.500
The best is still in store.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:03:40.990
Just ask the ones who did it, who did it, you won't regret it, just ask the ones who did it.
