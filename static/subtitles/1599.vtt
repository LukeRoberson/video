00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.239
Part of me, good women.

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:24.039
I heard that Jesus the Nazarene is somewhere in the area.

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:25.239
Have you seen him?

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:27.739
Why are you seeking him out?

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:29.739
Are you one of his disciples?

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:31.339
Are you one of his servants?

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:34.840
My dear woman, from what I hear the size of the crowds

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.840
will not allow you to come near Jesus.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.039
Do not even dream of meeting him.

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:43.740
Sisters, sisters, where is your love of strangers?

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.740
Please excuse the rudeness.

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:48.939
How can we be of assistance?

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:51.340
Come, sit here with us.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.840
Thank you.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.840
I have an urgent need to meet the Lord Jesus.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.439
Well, I'm not sure he's any kind of Lord,

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:01.640
but I can tell you I've heard no reports

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.539
about Jesus being around here.

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.739
Are you related to him?

00:01:05.739 --> 00:01:07.040
No.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.739
But I heard that he's curing the sick.

00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:15.040
And I'm a very sick woman.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.939
I've suffered from a flow of blood for some 12 years.

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.950
I've been unable to get a cure from anyone.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:31.049
And I've suffered so much at the hands of many physicians.

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.349
All of my money has been spent on this dreadful condition.

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:40.349
And after all these efforts, am I better?

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:42.049
No.

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.109
I've become worse.

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:52.510
When I heard about Jesus and the miracles that he has performed,

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.709
I knew he must be from God.

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:58.010
I have faith in his power.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:04.209
He can heal me even if I could touch just the fringes

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:06.109
of his outer garment.

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:08.509
I will get well.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:16.120
Otherwise, I will surely die.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.120
Teacher, teacher again.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.020
I plead with you.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.120
My little daughter is extremely ill.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.719
Please come and put your hands on her.

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:28.620
So she may get well and live.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.620
Please come to my house.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.219
Jesus, this is Jeris, one of the presenting officers of the synagogue.

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:39.620
He has been begging for your help.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.520
Jeris, where is your daughter?

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.919
Please take me to her.

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:44.419
She's a beautiful girl.

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:46.219
She's my only daughter.

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:48.719
She's only 12 years old and she is dying.

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:51.520
Please come quickly.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.120
I will come.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:08.810
Please lead the way.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.210
Who touched my outer garments?

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.210
Who touched me?

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.409
Not me, my Lord.

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:17.610
Peter, James, did one of you touch me?

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:18.710
No, my Lord.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.610
Jesus, surely you can see the crowds pressing in on you.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:22.409
Can you ask?

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:23.110
Who touched me?

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.409
Someone touched me.

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:27.009
For I know that power went out of me.

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:29.909
Woman, did you touch the Lord?

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:41.099
I have touched you.

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:48.860
I merely touched the fringes of his outer garments.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.659
I have no fear.

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:52.759
You've done nothing wrong.

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:55.659
Tell me, why did you touch my garment?

00:03:55.659 --> 00:04:03.550
I have been very ill for 12 years.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.449
Many physicians have treated me.

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:11.449
I have spent all that I had trying to find a cure,

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:14.250
but my condition got no better.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.050
Rather, I got worse.

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:19.649
I've heard about you.

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:21.949
I have faith in you.

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:26.149
I knew that if I could just touch the fringes

00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:29.449
of your outer garment, I could get well.

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:30.850
Forgive me.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.019
I just wanted to get well.

00:04:35.019 --> 00:04:37.120
Take courage, daughter.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:46.449
Your faith has made you well.

00:04:46.449 --> 00:05:03.810
Go in peace and be healed from your grievous sickness.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:09.310
Jeris, Jeris, your daughter has died.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.310
Let me take you home.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.910
My father-to-teacher any longer.

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:20.620
Jeris, I am sorry about your little daughter,

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.519
but have no fear.

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:25.720
Only have faith, and she will be saved.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:41.040
Take me to see her.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.139
Stop weeping, for she did not die.

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:50.920
But it's sleeping.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.819
Please, move away from the house.

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:56.920
Jeris, make sure the people stay out.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.819
You and your wife come with me, please.

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:05.290
Peter, James, John, come with me, please.

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:13.579
Jesus, she's already dead.

00:06:13.579 --> 00:06:52.040
I beg all of you, wait outside, please.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:07:06.050
Little girl, I say to you, get up.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.250
Teacher, I am forever indebted to you.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.449
My daughter, my only child, she's back.

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:12.949
Thank you.

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:23.790
Thank you.

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:28.490
Jeris, I must insist on your discretion regarding this matter.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.089
Please do not tell anyone that the girl was indeed dead

00:07:31.089 --> 00:07:38.279
and that she was brought back to life.

00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:40.180
Now this little girl is hungry.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.480
Bring her something to eat.
