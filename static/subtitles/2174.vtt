00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.070
Why did the fight for equality initially appeal to you?

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.030
South Africa has a history of legalized racism, but just because the laws changed, it doesn't

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:22.710
mean that what's been in transition to the minds and hearts of people has also changed.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.789
I observed that people still had prejudices and they had ideas of what I should look

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:36.030
like or talk like or where I should live and I didn't feel like I was accepted anywhere.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.829
I realized that people's needs were not taken care of.

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.270
For example, their living conditions were not great.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.109
Some had water and some didn't.

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:49.310
I wanted to help people.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:55.549
The time came when some political parties were saying that they could make a change.

00:00:55.549 --> 00:01:01.990
Now, in my heart, although I wouldn't say it, little by little, I started to support

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.990
them.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:11.909
Fortress are so powerful, everything's so loud and so moving, different colors, cultures,

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.230
boys, girls, everybody getting together to fight for the equality of others.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.590
I wanted to be part of making a change.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.750
What changes did you notice in yourself?

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.829
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, I could no longer go out freely.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.189
Yes, I did other things, but I also watched TV.

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.109
When I watched TV, I noticed the things I used to see while I was preaching.

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:45.909
The way women and children, the elderly and the immigrants in this country were treated,

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.269
it made me want to do something.

00:01:48.269 --> 00:01:50.989
My school also had a protest.

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:57.510
I knew that I couldn't protest as one of Jehovah's Witnesses, so it was a bit frustrating.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.030
And I also felt bad about not getting involved, like I was a bystander.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.229
I looked like I didn't care, and I didn't want anyone to think that that was the case.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.830
My parents noticed that I had become very focused on these things.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.830
Sometimes, I would even ask why people were treated this way.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.270
They helped me in many ways.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.710
They used relevant JW broadcasting episodes.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.710
They also helped me through family worship.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.349
The 2019 Love Never Fails Convention was my favorite convention.

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:37.310
The talk that stood out to me the most spoke about how love believes all things.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.150
If we love our brothers and sisters, that means that we believe that they have the best

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.949
intentions towards us and towards each other, I realized that I had to let go of negative

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:49.509
and critical thinking.

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:53.909
And now I have such amazing friendships with a variety of people.

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:59.469
But to see the love that they have for me and for each other, I get to show that and

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:01.750
also receive it.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:08.150
The scripture that came to mind was Jeremiah 1023, where it says that it does not belong

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.789
to man to direct a step.

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:14.990
Thinking about that scripture made me realize that people will not have success.

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.430
They have never succeeded in the past, and even now I see people fail.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.789
For me to show support, either by protesting or on social media, would be like painting

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:29.270
a sinking ship.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:37.310
This world is sinking and it won't do me any good to show support for it.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.669
How are you conquering injustice today?

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:49.590
I don't feel like I'm a bystander anymore, or that I'm not involved, instead of feeling

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.150
like exhausted and there's no change.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.349
I get to help people, giving people a hope for the future that comes from the Bible.

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:04.379
Now I don't focus much on news about how people are treated, the injustice.

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:12.900
But as a volunteer who preaches full time, I help people to know Jehovah, know the truth,

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.899
and know what Jehovah has in store for them in the future.

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:23.100
During my Bible study with my dad, he studied prophecies in the fulfillment of them, and so

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:29.899
I got to see that whatever Jehovah promised, he fulfilled 100%.

00:04:29.899 --> 00:04:36.540
So whatever his promise for the future, he's also going to fulfill.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.939
Jehovah's people have love.

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:44.420
They support each other in difficult times, even though they speak different languages.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.500
They come from different places, different countries.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:55.740
It convinces me that even in the future, under the rule of God's kingdom, everyone in

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.500
the world will be showing that love.
