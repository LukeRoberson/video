00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:06.780
When we think of events that will soon happen, such as the Great Tribulation in Armageddon,

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.779
wouldn't you agree that we need to build our faith now?

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:15.779
In fact, if you turn with me to Ezekiel, chapter 38, and you may want to put a marker there,

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:21.780
verses 14 and 15 describe the time when God's people will experience and all-out assault

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.780
by those determined to destroy pure worship.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:32.780
Verse 14 mentions that God, or as we know a coalition of nations, will come against God's people.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.780
And though, verse 18 states that on that day, Jehovah's great rage will flare up against his enemies,

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.780
the question is, will you and I remain confident in Jehovah's promise to rescue his people?

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:54.780
We can build our faith by considering another aspect of creation, the awesome power of wind and water.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.780
Please allow the following video to strengthen your faith.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:21.629
Hail, though it is made of ice, it is very different from snow.

00:01:21.629 --> 00:01:36.500
Hail usually forms in warm weather, when turbulent air produces thunderstorms with powerful updrafts.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:45.500
Those updrafts can pull a piece of dust or ice high into the cloud where water freezes around it.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.500
Each trip up into the cloud adds a layer of ice and weight.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.500
Until it becomes a hail stone that is heavy enough to fall,

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:09.900
hail storms can be powerfully destructive.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:18.550
One deadly storm dropped hail stones weighing more than one kilogram each.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.550
Jehovah used hail to demonstrate his power and defend his people,

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.550
such as during the seventh plague against Egypt.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.550
When Joshua fought the Amorites, Jehovah caused a great hail storm,

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:41.759
and more Amorites died from the hail stones done in battle.

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:50.759
Hail is also mentioned among the elements Jehovah will use in the future against those who attack his people.

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:57.759
Have you seen the storehouses of the hail, which I have reserved for the day of battle and war?

00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:07.830
As the video showed, wind and water in the form of hail are powerful and can at times be very destructive.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:14.830
For example, a report in a Wake magazine some years ago reported that at times humans are hurt,

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:22.830
even killed by hail stones weighing as much as one and a half pounds and as big as five inches in diameter.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.830
That's larger than this ball.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.830
And there are scientific reports of even larger hail stones.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.830
But as we know, Jehovah can use wind and water to fight for his people,

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.830
while he's the source of these natural forces, and he can control them perfectly.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.830
Please turn with me to Psalm 147, and let's notice that together.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:55.830
Psalm 147 will look at verses 17 and 18 for the assurance that Jehovah is the source of these natural forces.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:04.830
Psalm 147, 17, he hurls down his hail stones like morsels of bread, who can withstand his cold?

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.830
He sends out his word and they melt.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.830
He makes his wind blow and the waters flow.

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.829
Did you notice to whom these natural forces belong?

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.829
Verse 17 speaks of his hail stones.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.829
Verse 18 says, he makes his wind blow.

00:04:24.829 --> 00:04:28.829
Yes, Jehovah is the source and he can control them.

00:04:28.829 --> 00:04:30.829
He proved this in the past.

00:04:30.829 --> 00:04:33.829
Do you remember the examples given in the video?

00:04:33.829 --> 00:04:38.829
One was the account in Joshua chapter 10 when the Israelites were fighting the Amorites.

00:04:38.829 --> 00:04:42.829
Verse 11 states that while the Amorites were fleeing from Israel,

00:04:42.829 --> 00:04:47.829
Jehovah hurled great hail stones from the sky on them and they perished.

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:53.829
In fact, more died from the hail than from the sword of the Israelites.

00:04:53.829 --> 00:05:00.829
If Jehovah can create such powerful elements and control them, that should build our faith.

00:05:00.829 --> 00:05:05.829
It should convince us that he'll be able to use these powerful elements in the future

00:05:05.829 --> 00:05:09.829
when he defends his people at Armageddon.

00:05:09.829 --> 00:05:13.829
The video partially quoted a scripture that emphasizes that point.

00:05:13.829 --> 00:05:14.829
Let's read it together.

00:05:14.829 --> 00:05:17.829
Job chapter 38.

00:05:17.829 --> 00:05:20.829
Job 38.

00:05:20.829 --> 00:05:25.829
And notice with me verses 22 and 23.

00:05:25.829 --> 00:05:27.829
Job 38, 22.

00:05:27.829 --> 00:05:35.079
Have you entered the storehouses of the snow or have you seen the storehouses of the hail,

00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:41.079
which I have reserved for the time of distress, for the day of battle and war?

00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:48.079
Did you notice that Jehovah says he has storehouses of hail, reserved for the day of battle?

00:05:48.079 --> 00:05:53.079
So on 135 verse 7 mentions storehouses of wind.

00:05:53.079 --> 00:06:00.079
In these verses, Jehovah speaks of things he's reserved under his control for special purposes.

00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:06.079
How can this knowledge of Jehovah's storehouses build our faith?

00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:09.079
When we're attacked during the Great Tribulation by God's enemies,

00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:16.079
no matter how powerful or threatening they may seem, they can't possibly survive Jehovah's anger.

00:06:16.079 --> 00:06:22.079
For example, if we go back to Ezekiel chapter 38 and glance at verse 22,

00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:26.079
we see things Jehovah will use against those enemies of pure worship.

00:06:27.079 --> 00:06:33.079
Besides pestilence, fire and sulfur, notice what else Jehovah will use in the middle of the verse.

00:06:33.079 --> 00:06:34.079
It says,

00:06:34.079 --> 00:06:40.079
I will rain down a torrential downpour and hail stones.

00:06:40.079 --> 00:06:43.079
Yes, Jehovah will use water.

00:06:43.079 --> 00:06:49.079
He may use hail stones of undisclosed size to destroy those wicked humans.

00:06:49.079 --> 00:06:54.079
Now, during that time, will we need to fear the natural elements?

00:06:54.079 --> 00:06:55.079
Not at all.

00:06:55.079 --> 00:06:58.079
Second Peter chapter 2 verse 9 assures us,

00:06:58.079 --> 00:07:04.079
Jehovah knows how to rescue people of godly devotion out of trial.

00:07:04.079 --> 00:07:10.550
Jehovah will perfectly control the natural elements so his people are not harmed.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:16.550
This knowledge about the awesome power of wind and water should make us powerful by faith.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:21.550
It should build our faith not only in Jehovah's ability to protect us in the future,

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.550
but also in his protection now.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:30.550
For instance, we have no reason to fear bans or threats from worldly governments.

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:35.550
The one who controls the storehouses of the wind and hail is our helper.

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:38.550
According to Hebrews chapter 13 verse 6,

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.550
we do not need to be afraid.

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:50.550
That's true now, and it will be true in the future when Jehovah brings the natural elements at his disposal against our enemies.

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:54.550
Notice his assurance at the end of Ezekiel chapter 38.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.550
Notice verse 23,

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:04.550
and I will certainly magnify myself and sanctify myself and make myself known before the eyes of many nations,

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:09.550
and they will have to know that I am Jehovah.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:12.550
What a thrilling time that will be.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:19.550
As these enemies are defeated, they will know that it is Jehovah God who is bringing destruction upon them.

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:26.550
May our anticipation of that happy outcome and our study of creation build our faith now,

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:30.550
as we confidently look forward to Jehovah's complete victory.

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:38.379
Where the Robert Lucioni, a helper to the publishing committee, will now present the next talk of this symposium.

00:08:38.379 --> 00:08:40.379
Use creation to build your faith.

00:08:40.379 --> 00:08:42.379
See creatures.
