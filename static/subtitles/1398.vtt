00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:04.360
Then can you more about what we talked about on Monday?

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.360
I did.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.359
But...

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:11.359
Why would your Hover make a rule like that?

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:14.359
No sex unless you're married. It's totally okay.

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:17.359
It might seem odd, but...

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.359
What quality do you most appreciate about your Hover?

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:23.359
Who's love?

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:24.359
Me too.

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.359
So, if he truly loves us,

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.359
look at what he tells us at Isaiah 48 verse 17.

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:36.859
I, Jehovah, am your God.

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:40.359
Your God, Jade.

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:45.359
The one teaching you to benefit yourself.

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:48.359
The one guiding you in the way you should walk.

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:56.509
I don't get it. It just doesn't make sense.

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:59.509
Question.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.340
Does a little child always understand why mum and dad

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.340
warns them not to do certain things?

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:10.579
Probably not.

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:13.579
So, why all the rules and warnings?

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:16.579
Well, they love them, don't they?

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.590
And so, if Jehovah loves you,

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.590
it often takes time to appreciate why

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.590
Jehovah asks certain things of us.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
But if we really love him,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
we'll have faith that what he asks

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
is for the best.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.140
The real question is,

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:50.799
do you trust him?

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.909
I won't do.

00:01:58.269 --> 00:01:59.269
I really do.
