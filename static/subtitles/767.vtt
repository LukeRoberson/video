00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:12.519
O would some power the gift give us to see ourselves as others see us, it would from many

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.120
a blunder free us."

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:23.920
Well that famous quote from the Scottish poet Robert Burns acknowledges that it is impossible

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.320
always to see ourselves as others do.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.679
Well that's why we need training.

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.159
That's why we need advice.

00:00:33.159 --> 00:00:39.840
That's why we need counsel to help us to improve and to work on certain flaws that perhaps

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.240
we just can't see in ourselves.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.840
Well what a wonderful opportunity.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:55.240
You students at Gilead have had to receive focused spiritual training from brothers who

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.520
truly love you.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:05.040
Now no doubt you've come to see yourself more clearly than you have ever seen yourself

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.040
before.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.840
But you know that quote from Robert Burns can be understood in a different way too.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:22.079
See maybe what we cannot see clearly in ourselves are all of the good qualities that we possess

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:28.640
or the potential that we have to be used by Jehovah in his service.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:36.560
First Samuel chapter 16 and verse 7 says, man sees what appears to the eyes, but Jehovah

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.359
sees into the heart.

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:46.680
Well in seeing into your heart, Jehovah saw fit to draw you into a dedicated relationship

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.079
with him.

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:53.040
And since then he's entrusted you with various assignments in his service.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.359
Now why?

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:56.159
Why did Jehovah do that?

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.879
What does he see in you?

00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:00.879
What qualities?

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:04.079
What spiritual qualifications does he observe?

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:12.039
Well, we can't know all that Jehovah sees in you because we cannot see ourselves as

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:14.319
Jehovah sees us.

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:22.159
It's probably why so many of God's servants and Bible times were reluctant to accept challenging

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:23.680
assignments.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.599
Now just think of some examples of this.

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:34.360
People who did not see the fine qualities in themselves that Jehovah could see.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.520
For example, take Gideon.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:46.419
Now in judges chapter 6, let's look at this, judges chapter 6 and verse 14, notice what

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:50.500
Jehovah said to Gideon.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.300
He said, go with the strength you have and you will save Israel out of Midian's hand.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.300
Is it not I who sent you?

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.020
But now how did Gideon react?

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:07.259
Verse 15, Gideon said, pardon me Jehovah, how can I save Israel?

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:14.900
Look, my clan is the least in Manasseh and I am the most insignificant in my father's

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:15.900
house.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:23.860
Well, obviously Gideon could not see himself as Jehovah saw him.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.580
What about Moses?

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:32.219
In Exodus chapter 4, when Jehovah assigned him to lead Israel out of Egypt, Moses was keenly

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:35.300
aware of all of his inadequacies.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:42.060
In fact, when talking with Jehovah, he raised one objection after another.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.020
He was Jehovah aware of the inadequacies that Moses had, of course.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.819
Of course he was.

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:56.379
He also knew that Moses' brother Aaron was older and that he was a better speaker.

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:05.900
But Jehovah saw in Moses qualities of faith, unselfishness and meekness, qualities that

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.500
made Moses the right choice for the job.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.740
What about Jeremiah?

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.420
When Jehovah commissioned him to serve as a prophet, do you remember what he said?

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.420
Let's look at it.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:30.399
Jeremiah chapter 1, Jeremiah chapter 1, look at verse 6, Jeremiah says, Alasso sovereign

00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:37.040
Lord Jehovah, I do not know how to speak for I am just a boy.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:43.000
Well what did Jehovah say, okay, okay, Jeremiah, see if I find someone else.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.160
Look at verse 7, Jehovah then said to me, do not say I am but a boy.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:57.800
For you must go to all those to whom I send you and you should say everything that I command

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.800
you.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:07.079
Why was Jehovah so confident that Jeremiah was the right choice for this special assignment?

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:13.480
Well of course, if you look at verse 8, Jehovah says, I am with you.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.199
Now of course, that's the same thing that Jehovah said to Gideon.

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:17.800
It's the same thing he said to Moses.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.879
In other words, because Jehovah was with them, they would be successful.

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:25.720
But there's another reason too.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:33.319
You see what it says in verse 5, Jehovah says to Jeremiah, before I formed you in the womb,

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:37.000
I knew, isn't that interesting?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
I knew you.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.360
And before you were born, I sanctified you.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.800
I made you a prophet to the nations.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.079
Jehovah knew Jeremiah.

00:05:49.079 --> 00:05:56.279
He saw in Jeremiah certain qualities that would make him an effective prophet with Jehovah's

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:57.800
help.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.000
Well could Jeremiah see that in himself?

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.279
No.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.480
He just had to trust in Jehovah's assessment.

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:09.879
Move forward and do what Jehovah asked him to do.

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:14.519
Well we have wonderful examples of this in our modern day too.

00:06:15.079 --> 00:06:18.920
Brother John Booth was a faithful, humble brother.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.920
He started an in full-time service in 1928.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:30.120
Now in 1935, he was called to work at the factory at Bethel.

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:35.480
But now just after working for a few days, he was very surprised when Brother

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:41.160
Nor invited him to go on the road as a regional service director, what we would

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.920
perhaps call a circuit over here today.

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:49.399
Brother Nor explained there was a great need and that Brother Booth could be a big help

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:52.519
because of his experience as a pioneer.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.839
But Brother Booth replied that he had never had a position in the congregation.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.079
He had never given a talk, can you imagine?

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.879
And he had no training to do so.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.519
But here's what Brother Nor said,

00:07:07.959 --> 00:07:11.160
eloquent speakers are not what is needed.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:18.519
Just someone who loves the service and will take the lead in it and will talk about service

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.040
at the meetings.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:28.279
Brother Booth said, with misgivings, doubts and fears, but wanting to do Jehovah's will,

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.360
I agreed to try it.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.360
Well, how did it turn out?

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:35.000
Brother Booth moved forward.

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:42.920
He spent his whole life in full-time service, later serving for more than 20 years as a member

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:48.600
of the governing body. When he finished his earthly course, the watchtower stated,

00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:55.959
he was beloved for his profoundly humble and kind Christian personality.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:02.759
Obviously, Jehovah saw something good in Brother John Booth.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.839
Well, what do we learn from these examples?

00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:10.439
Like Gideon and Moses and Jeremiah and Brother Booth,

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:15.560
we might feel inadequate for certain assignments.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.639
And it's good that we're not overconfident or too self-reliant,

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.959
yet we don't want to go to the other extreme either.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.759
If so, you see, we could begin to think, I could never be a pioneer.

00:08:28.759 --> 00:08:31.079
I could never be a ministerial servant.

00:08:31.079 --> 00:08:32.519
I could never be an elder.

00:08:32.519 --> 00:08:34.120
I could never be a Bethelite.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.639
I could never be a construction servant and on and on and on.

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:41.879
If we're given one of those assignments or some other one,

00:08:42.759 --> 00:08:46.440
we could even hesitate to accept, give into fear.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:54.039
But the fact is that we cannot fully see ourselves as Jehovah does.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:09:01.480
How much better to make ourselves available and then move forward with the work that we're

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:07.000
given to do, looking to Jehovah to make up for whatever we may lack.

00:09:08.039 --> 00:09:11.240
When I'll use students who are soon to be graduates,

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:16.120
we'll note out have a variety of assignments in the coming years.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:24.440
Whatever those assignments are, move forward with full confidence in Jehovah.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.120
Jehovah will be with you.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:31.879
He'll give you everything that you need to be successful in accomplishing the work.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.679
So, here's the question.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.600
Can you see yourself as Jehovah sees you?

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:43.879
Well, perhaps to some extent, yes, but not completely.

00:09:44.679 --> 00:09:49.480
So, be ready to listen to counsel and to make adjustments.

00:09:50.759 --> 00:09:58.919
But also, when your good qualities and your good potential are noticed and you receive new

00:09:58.919 --> 00:10:06.600
assignments, grab hold and move forward and may our wonderful God.

00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:12.519
Jehovah always be with you and bless you as you do so.
