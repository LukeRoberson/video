00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:12.169
I came to Greece as an immigrant when I was just 60 years old.

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:16.489
Because of that, I never felt saved with people around me.

00:00:16.489 --> 00:00:21.170
At that time, I was renting an apartment from a man who was studying the Bible with one

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.410
of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.739
One day, I joined the study and the brother invited me to the convention.

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:37.950
I was very cautious at the beginning, but the brother seemed trustworthy.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.270
I always had questions about true God, and I wanted to learn more about Him.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.390
So I decided to go.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.189
In 2016, I received an invitation from my son to attend the convention of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:57.670
He was getting baptized at that convention, and it was important to him for me to be there.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.869
And so he asked me to go.

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:07.989
Even though I was very active in another religion for 30 years, I went in order to please him.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.909
I learned the truth after I subplicated God with all my strength, because I was really lost.

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.030
I asked for answers to questions that were yet unanswered, and God answered me.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.069
Jehovah gave me the answer to my prayers when I found this.

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:31.629
This invitation, deliverance at hand, was the answer to my prayers.

00:01:31.629 --> 00:01:35.150
Arriving there at that convention, I observed the crowd.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.430
Many people starting right at the parking lot.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.390
Everything organized, people entering in an orderly manner.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.230
Inside the assembly hall, everyone was very organized, well dressed, very loving.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:56.829
And when the convention began, I saw such spiritual food that I had never seen in my religion.

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:02.870
Thirty years in a religion, I thought I knew a lot, but I didn't know anything.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.790
So I decided to study.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.069
When I arrived at the convention, I started watching the people.

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.069
Their faces were smiley.

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.030
They seemed to be happy.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.900
There were men, women, and children from different races and nationalities.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.620
When they sang, I could sense their true joy and unity.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.979
For the first time in my life, I felt very safe.

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:35.580
I was not in fear of being taken advantage of.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:42.870
Also, what I learned at that convention drew me to the true God.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.069
I thought that if all these people are truly happy and feel really safe

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:53.229
being part of this organization, Jehovah's organization, then indeed,

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:57.340
that is what I was looking for.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.780
I went to the convention on Sunday.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.379
I was really warmly welcomed by all the brothers and sisters there.

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:10.180
I listened to all the morning program.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.699
And at noon, I recognized the sound of the truth.

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:17.219
I was sure it was the truth.

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:21.900
I decided to become one of Jehovah's Witnesses, and I became one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.659
I got baptized in 2017, and now I serve as a pioneer.

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:30.979
My first study was the following Wednesday.

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:33.580
I was happy to get to know Jehovah.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.379
Now I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:41.460
And as much as I can, I participate in the invitation campaigns.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.939
I really hope that it has many people be delivered.

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:49.860
I started attending meetings right after the convention.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:56.419
I started a Bible study and eventually I got baptized as one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:02.939
My mother, one of my brothers and my two sisters are now serving Jehovah's well.

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:07.099
Later on, I got married to a faithful sister, a very good wife,

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:09.860
and we serve Jehovah together.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.740
People need to feel safe.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.500
And I know for sure that Jehovah's organization is the safest place you can be.
