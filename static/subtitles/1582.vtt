00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:08.810
Right about the time I started studying the Bible, an opportunity came up for me to start

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.710
doing secretarial work at a church.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.789
I was the one who cared for all of the money that the church would receive.

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.230
But at that moment, I didn't see any problem with staying where I worked.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:35.509
I studied the Bible and learned that the festivals I used to participate in or displeasing to Jehovah.

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:42.789
It did not seem possible that I would be the only one not participating in those festivals.

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:50.479
These opportunities brought families closer together and they were fun too.

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:56.119
One night at a meeting, I was talking with an elder and he told me that I wouldn't even

00:00:56.119 --> 00:01:01.960
be able to give student parts at the Kingdom Hall since I was still working as a secretary

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.500
at the church.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:12.299
That made me very sad because I found myself just receiving guidance from Jehovah and learning

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.819
his truth.

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:20.170
But I was not giving back anything to him despite what he was doing for me.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.689
However, I have to admit that I still hadn't completely made up my mind.

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:30.810
Since my husband had back surgery and wasn't able to work at the time, we had a little

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.810
daughter to care for.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.849
So I kept thinking, what should I do?

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:41.069
Right now, this is the only money we have coming in.

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:45.989
I prayed a lot to Jehovah for help with this issue.

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:48.829
I thought about Jehovah's feelings.

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:54.310
I didn't want to do anything that hurt Jehovah.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:02.150
When I stopped participating in religious festivals, my family stopped speaking to me.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.150
When it was time for the festivals, it made me think that they were together and I was

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.270
by myself.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:17.699
So at times, I cried.

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:24.090
I meditated on God's promise at Sam 2710.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:32.169
Jehovah promised me that if my parents abandoned me, he would receive me as his child.

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:36.759
It helped me to stand firm.

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:43.960
Personally, I tried to attend the meetings and participate in the ministry too.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:50.159
All of these activities made me feel that the congregation is like a family.

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:55.900
And that Jehovah is the father of all of us.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.740
But I never forgot my parents.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.659
So I tried to help them in whatever ways I could.

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:14.909
I took about three or four days of occasion to go help them harvest rice.

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:18.710
I had great help from my instructor.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.669
Just as Jehovah doesn't force us, she didn't force me.

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:28.830
As she told experiences and showed me in the Bible what really pleases Jehovah, it made

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.830
me realize that I had to make a decision.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:39.150
As my Bible study got deeper, I began to realize that I really was already loving Jehovah

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.610
and wanted to please him.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.650
Before Jehovah, my conscious was already affecting me.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.379
I had to make a decision on his side.

00:03:53.379 --> 00:04:00.120
That's exactly what I did.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.960
Two weeks later, I got a job and it was close to my home.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.319
I was able to gain a clean conscience before Jehovah.

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.800
I have seen this in my life.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:19.540
Everyone who trusts in Jehovah is not helpless.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:26.939
When I told my parents that although I changed my religion, I still loved them.

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:32.699
They started to open up and talk to me gradually.

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:36.699
So I invited them to attend a meeting.

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:45.540
When my father attended the meeting, he said, Oh, you made a good decision, my son.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.180
And I was very happy.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:56.100
I still hope that my family will one day study the Bible and worship Jehovah along with

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.420
me.
