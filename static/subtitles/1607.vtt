00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:17.500
The challenge of serving in a foreign country can sometimes be that because you've made

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.899
that move and you've learned a foreign language, you can feel like you've done enough.

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:28.339
I was brought up by a witness mother, so I studied the Bible since I was small, so I thought

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:32.740
I had Bible knowledge to some extent.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.140
My wife and I have enjoyed the traveling work for 18 years.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:44.140
As we get older, trials that we never experienced when we were young come up one after another.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.820
After I got married and had children, I had a hard time explaining the backgrounds of some

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:57.700
Bible characters or biblical history when I studied the Bible with my children.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.539
Then I realized that I did not have enough Bible knowledge.

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.620
And another challenge can be that you're dealing with a foreign culture in the territory,

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.780
but you also have many different cultures in the congregation.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.260
When I struggle to fulfill various responsibilities in a balanced way, things such as caring

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.859
for aged parents and our own health issues can be a source of stress and cause tension

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:27.900
between my wife and me.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:35.739
The study article moved forward as a spiritual person in February 2018, was a big help.

00:01:35.739 --> 00:01:40.260
The expressions, once we have identified areas for improvement, we need to take positive

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:47.260
steps and that it is a life and death matter, really touched my heart.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.579
I realized that I needed to scrutinize my life seriously and make improvements for my

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.459
own future and that of my family.

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:59.739
The article had a quote from Brother Barr that said, many fail because they're not diligent

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:01.700
enough to grow mighty.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:08.060
This made me think, am I mighty enough to overcome any challenges that might come up difficulties

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.139
with brothers and sisters in a way that pleases Jehovah?

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:16.620
To move ahead as a spiritual person, I realized I needed to get Jehovah's thinking on matters

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.060
and really look at Bible principles and that means letting go of my pride when it comes

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.939
back, letting go of it again and really making Jehovah's thoughts my own thoughts.

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:37.460
I have a bad tendency to try to do everything by myself and to not delegate things to others.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:43.699
I ask myself, what decision will please Jehovah?

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:47.340
Make sure of the more important things.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.340
I felt the need to train younger brothers in a congregation so that I could delegate

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.259
responsibilities to them.

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:59.699
The article encouraged us to look to Bible principles and to that really helped me,

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:07.419
for Proverbs 15, verse 28 and Philippians chapter 2, verse 4, because it helped me to think

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:13.419
about what is in the person's best interest before I responded to them.

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:18.860
I took time when reading Bible accounts to meditate on how I would feel if I were one

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.659
of those Bible characters.

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:31.280
I can now explain things better at my children's study.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:37.879
I'm very happy to see my children truly enjoying Christian activities.

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.400
My son started doing play meetings for fun.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.680
My daughter loves the ministry.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.240
She talks to people willingly, not because we as parents are telling her to do so.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:55.000
Compared to how it was when I was a child, things are totally different now and that really

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.199
makes me happy.

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:06.939
By applying this principle, I can lighten my load and reduce my stress level.

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:13.780
In turn, that helps me to maintain joy, to strengthen our relationship as a couple and

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:20.019
I feel I've become more approachable to those in a congregation.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.100
Having the mind of Christ has helped me in my assignment because it's helped me to form

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.379
really close friendships with the brothers and sisters in my congregation and that's brought

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:31.100
me a lot of joy in my service.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:38.220
And also, when I don't know what to do, which often happens, I have Jehovah's principles

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.899
to guide me and that makes me feel safe and secure.
