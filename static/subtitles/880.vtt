WEBVTT

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:05.700
Would you agree that we live in difficult times?

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:12.660
Despite some advances in technology, people still must endure the ravages of war,

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:18.579
food shortages, pestilence, and disasters of various kinds.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.179
Add to that the bitter opposition and persecution we face from those who do not yet know Jehovah.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.100
How we yearn for justice and relief.

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:38.500
The Bible Book of Revelation figuratively quotes faithful martyrs as calling out to Jehovah

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:46.500
until when, sovereign Lord, holy and true, are you refraining from judging and avenging our blood?

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.820
Although those martyrs were told to wait a little longer,

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:57.659
Christ Jesus makes this remarkable statement recorded at Revelation 10 verse 6.

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:01.179
There will be no delay any longer.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.900
That's good news. The entire Book of Revelation is good news for all who love and trust Jehovah.

00:01:11.099 --> 00:01:18.459
It foretells momentous events, but we need not fear them because we know that Jehovah cares for us.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:26.060
The good news that Revelation contains is that all that grieves us today will soon disappear.

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:31.819
And all of its promises center on one person, Jesus Christ.

00:01:33.019 --> 00:01:39.980
In its very first verse, this thrilling Bible Book is described as a revelation by Jesus Christ.

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:43.819
It foretells events that occur during the Lord's day.

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:53.260
That is, the period that began when our Lord Jesus became king in 1914 and continues until the end of his thousand year reign.

00:01:54.219 --> 00:02:00.379
And throughout Revelation, we read of Jesus' key role in destroying God's enemies,

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.299
removing our suffering, and restoring earth to a paradise.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.780
These are not empty promises.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.620
Revelation 1 verse 1 declares that these things must shortly take place.

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:23.020
What sort of things must shortly take place?

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.699
What role will Jesus play in these events?

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:30.139
And how will they bring justice and relief to us?

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:37.340
Let's begin by considering what will happen to the world empire of false religion.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.939
Please turn to Revelation chapter 18.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.460
Revelation depicts false religion as an evil prostitute, with the name Babylon the Great.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.180
For millennium, she has ridiculed, persecuted, and killed God's people.

00:02:56.539 --> 00:03:00.219
Shamelessly, she has exploited and deceived people with lies.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.659
Her influence is strong, but that's about to change.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:14.379
As we begin reading at Revelation 18 verse 1, note what will happen to Babylon the Great and why?

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:24.189
After this, I saw another angel descending from heaven with great authority,

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:31.949
and the earth was illuminated by his glory, and he cried out with a strong voice saying,

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:40.110
she has fallen, Babylon the Great has fallen, and she has become a dwelling place of demons,

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.469
and a place where every unclean spirit and every unclean and hated bird lurks.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.430
For because of the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality,

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:57.069
all the nations have fallen victim, and the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality with her,

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.830
and the merchants of the earth became rich, owing to the power of her shameless luxury.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.349
And I heard another voice out of heaven say,

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.550
Get out of her, my people, if you do not want to share with her in her sins,

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.509
and if you do not want to receive part of her plagues.

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:23.790
For her sins have massed together, clear up to heaven, and God has called her acts of

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.750
injustice to mind. Repay her in the way she treated others.

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:32.910
Yes, pay her back double for the things she has done.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.389
In the cup she has mixed, mixed a double portion for her,

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:43.470
to the extent that she glorified herself, and lived in shameless luxury,

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.509
to that extent give her torment and mourning, for she keeps saying in her heart,

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.709
I sit as queen, and I am not a widow, and I will never see mourning.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.629
That is why in one day her plagues will come.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:05.870
Death, and mourning, and famine, and she will be completely burned with fire,

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.389
because Jehovah God who judged her is strong.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.449
Babylon views herself as a powerful queen who will never be brought down.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.129
Why should she? After all, she has thrived for thousands of years,

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:29.889
and yet a terrible destruction is coming, and it will envelop her suddenly as if in one day,

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:37.410
what role does Jesus play in this event? Look again at verses one and two.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:45.329
Who announces the fall of Babylon, an angel whose glory lights up the whole earth?

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:51.009
To whom has Jehovah given such glory to our Lord Jesus?

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:58.529
Since 1914, Jesus has been exercising authority over the earth as king and judge.

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.649
How fitting that he announces the fall of Babylon the Great.

00:06:04.769 --> 00:06:06.850
But that judgment brings with it a warning.

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:09.170
Get out of her.

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:16.129
Never would we want to have any part of an organization that's doomed to destruction.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:20.850
Jehovah detests Babylon the Great, so must we.

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:26.129
And yet, there are many who have profited from false religion.

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:31.569
Rulers have looked to Babylon the Great to support their policies and their wars.

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:40.019
Merchants have benefited financially. How do they react to Babylon's surprising and sudden

00:06:40.019 --> 00:06:46.259
destruction? Let's see as we continue reading from Revelation 18 verse 9.

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:24.029
Great city, Babylon, you strong city, because in one hour your judgment has arrived.

00:07:25.149 --> 00:07:31.949
Also, the merchants of the earth are weeping and mourning over her because there is no one to buy

00:07:31.949 --> 00:07:40.670
their full cargo anymore, a full cargo of gold, silver, precious stones, pearls, fine linen,

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:47.790
purple cloth, silk, and scarlet cloth, and everything made from scented wood,

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:54.910
and every sort of object made from ivory, and from precious wood, copper, iron, and marble.

00:07:54.910 --> 00:08:04.110
Also, cinnamon, Indian spice, incense, perfumed oil, frankincense, wine, olive oil,

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:12.189
fine flower, wheat, cattle, sheep, horses, carriages, slaves, and human lives.

00:08:18.399 --> 00:08:25.680
Yes, the fine fruit that you desired has left you, and all the delicacies, and the splendid

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:32.720
things have vanished from you, never to be found again. The merchants who sold these things,

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:38.799
who became rich from her, will stand at a distance because of their fear of her torment,

00:08:38.879 --> 00:08:44.240
and will weep and mourn, saying, too bad, too bad the great city,

00:08:44.879 --> 00:08:51.919
clothed with fine linen, purple, and scarlet, and richly adorned with gold ornaments,

00:08:51.919 --> 00:08:59.440
precious stones, and pearls. Because in one hour such great riches have been devastated,

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:06.399
and every ship captain, and every seafaring person, and sailors, and all those who make a living

00:09:06.399 --> 00:09:13.039
by the sea, stood at a distance, and cried out as they look at the smoke from her burning,

00:09:13.039 --> 00:09:20.320
and said, what city is like the great city? They threw dust on their heads, and cried out,

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:28.480
weeping, and mourning, and said, too bad, too bad the great city, in which all those who had

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:35.919
ships at sea became rich from her wealth, because in one hour she has been devastated.

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:49.409
Too bad, too bad they cry, but what about God's servants? They have a much different reaction.

00:09:50.929 --> 00:09:57.649
Let's read on from verse 20 to see how God's servants both in heaven and on earth will react

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:05.090
to Babylon's destruction. Notice, too, why false religion deserves such scathing judgment.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:28.019
And a strong angel lifted up a stone like a great new stone, and hurled it into the sea,

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:36.419
saying, thus with a swift pitch will Babylon the great city be hurled down, and she will never

00:10:36.419 --> 00:10:43.299
be found again, and the sound of singers who accompany themselves on the heart, of musicians,

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:51.860
of flutists, and of trumpeters will never be heard in you again, and no craftsmen who practices

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:59.059
any trade will ever be found in you again, and no sound of a millstone will ever be heard in you

00:10:59.059 --> 00:11:08.100
again. No light of a lamp will ever shine in you again, and no voice of a bridegroom and of a bride

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:13.779
will ever be heard in you again. For your merchants were the top-ranking men of the earth,

00:11:14.419 --> 00:11:21.460
and by your spiritual practices all the nations were misled. Yes, in her was found the blood of

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:28.419
prophets, and of holy ones, and of all those who have been slaughtered on the earth. After this,

00:11:29.139 --> 00:11:36.100
I heard what seemed to be a loud voice of a great crowd in heaven. They said,

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:52.740
pray to salvation and the glory and the power, because his judgments are true and righteous,

00:11:52.740 --> 00:12:02.019
for he has executed judgment on the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality,

00:12:02.019 --> 00:12:10.659
and he has avenged the blood of his slaves and is on her hands. And right away, for the second time,

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:18.190
they said,

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:34.269
Yes, praise jaw. Why? False religious leaders were responsible for the death of the prophets,

00:12:34.269 --> 00:12:39.870
and of Jesus Christ himself. Later, the disciple Stephen asked the religious leaders,

00:12:40.269 --> 00:12:44.830
which one of the prophets did your forefathers not persecute?

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:50.669
Yes, they killed those who announced in advance the coming of the righteous one,

00:12:51.389 --> 00:12:57.789
whose betrayers and murderers you have now become. Instead of taking Stephen's rebuke to heart,

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:05.840
they murdered him too, that same day. In the century since Stephen's day,

00:13:06.799 --> 00:13:13.759
false religion has continued to mislead, to slaughter, and to corrupt the earth with her sexual immorality.

00:13:14.639 --> 00:13:21.360
So once again, we can ask, why praise jaw? The heavenly chorus answers,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:30.240
because God's judgments are true and righteous. Our just God, Jehovah, will make sure that false

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:35.759
religion will never again defile this world and harm his loyal servants.

00:13:37.519 --> 00:13:44.559
The destruction of Babel on the Great marks the beginning of what Jesus called the Great Tribulation.

00:13:46.399 --> 00:13:53.120
After false religion is gone, what comes next? The book of Ezekiel foretells that the nations will

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:59.919
attack Jehovah's people, coming like a vast army and like clouds covering the land.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:05.919
But this is not the first time that the political system has acted against Jehovah and his people.

00:14:07.519 --> 00:14:13.120
Many nations have fiercely opposed true worship. They've banned our meetings and our

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:19.840
preaching work. In prison, men and women, old and young, for the so-called crime of owning a Bible,

00:14:20.559 --> 00:14:27.279
or talking about their God, some of our brothers and sisters have even been tortured for their faith.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:35.840
Of course, as long as Jehovah allows human governments to rule over us, we respect them.

00:14:37.039 --> 00:14:39.600
And not all governments have actively opposed us.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:46.159
Still, human government itself is insulting to Jehovah.

00:14:46.799 --> 00:14:52.159
Human rulers suggest that they could rule better than the King of kings and Lord of

00:14:52.159 --> 00:15:01.840
Lords, Christ Jesus, how arrogant. No wonder then that once these political powers attack God's people,

00:15:02.799 --> 00:15:12.320
Jesus will take action. In Revelation 19, note the actions that Jesus takes against the Anglo-American

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:18.399
world power portrayed as a false prophet, and the entire political system described as the

00:15:18.399 --> 00:15:25.200
kings of the earth and the wild beast. We'll begin reading at Revelation 19, verse 11.

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:53.389
And on his head are many diadems. He has a name written that no one knows but he himself,

00:15:53.389 --> 00:16:01.070
and he is clothed with an outer garment, stained with blood, and he is called by the name

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:08.350
the Word of God. Also, the armies in heaven were following him on white horses,

00:16:09.309 --> 00:16:16.350
and they were clothed in white, clean, fine linen. Ask, out of his mouth,

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:23.470
protrudes a sharp, long sword with which to strike the nations, and he will shepherd them with

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:31.710
a rod of iron. Moreover, he treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty.

00:16:32.429 --> 00:16:41.870
On his outer garment, yes, on his thigh, he has a name written, King of kings, and Lord of Lords.

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:51.070
I saw also an angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with a loud voice and said to all the

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:58.509
birds that fly in mid-Heaven, come here. Be gathered together to the great evening meal of God

00:16:59.149 --> 00:17:05.150
so that you may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of military commanders, and the flesh

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:11.390
of straw men, and the flesh of horses, and of those seated on them, and the flesh of all,

00:17:12.029 --> 00:17:16.910
of free men, as well as of slaves, and of small ones, and great.

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:24.829
And I saw the wild beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:32.910
to wage war against the one seated on the horse, and against his army, and the wild beast was caught,

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:40.269
and along with it the false prophet that performed in front of it the signs with which he misled

00:17:40.269 --> 00:17:47.390
those who received the mark of the wild beast, and those who worship its image, while still alive,

00:17:48.109 --> 00:17:55.950
they both were hurled into the fiery lake that burns with sulfur, but the rest were killed off with

00:17:55.950 --> 00:18:04.430
the long sword that proceeded out of the mouth of the one seated on the horse, and all the birds were

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:13.920
food with their flesh. Who else but Christ Jesus would lead the heavenly forces to the battle of

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:21.599
Armageddon? False religion has already been destroyed. Now Jesus turns his attention to what

00:18:21.599 --> 00:18:28.240
remains of Satan's wicked world. It's political and commercial systems. He dismantles,

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:35.839
destroys, and brings to nothing all who oppose true worship on earth, but enemies of true

00:18:35.839 --> 00:18:44.799
worship still remain. Who are they? And what does Jesus do about them? Follow along at Revelation 20

00:18:44.799 --> 00:18:54.910
versus one through three. And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven with the key of the abyss,

00:18:54.910 --> 00:19:03.710
and a great chain in his hand. He sees the dragon, the original serpent, who is the devil and Satan,

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:11.950
and bound him for one thousand years, and he hurled him into the abyss and shut it and sealed it

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:19.710
over him so that he would not mislead the nations anymore until the one thousand years were ended.

00:19:20.349 --> 00:19:30.819
After this, he must be released for a little while. Who has the key of the abyss?

00:19:31.299 --> 00:19:40.660
Doubtless the same one who was prophesied to brew Satan's head, Jesus Christ. It's Jesus who

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:48.180
will remove all enemies of God, including the great enemy Satan himself. Into the abyss he'll go,

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:58.500
Jesus doesn't just put him there, he hurls him there. Good riddance. After the dust of Armageddon

00:19:58.579 --> 00:20:05.779
settles, God's kingdom will act to restore the earth to the state Jehovah originally intended.

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:14.339
Those who've been loyal to Jehovah will then witness astonishing things. Let's consider one of them

00:20:14.339 --> 00:20:24.819
beginning at Revelation 20 verse 12. And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before

00:20:24.819 --> 00:20:33.220
the throne and scrolls were opened, but another scroll was opened. It is the scroll of life.

00:20:34.259 --> 00:20:40.259
The dead were judged out of those things written in the scrolls according to their deeds.

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:47.619
And the seal gave up the dead in it, and death and the grave gave up the dead in them,

00:20:48.339 --> 00:20:55.940
and they were judged individually according to their deeds. And death and the grave were

00:20:55.940 --> 00:21:03.059
holed into the lake of fire. This means the second death, the lake of fire.

00:21:06.559 --> 00:21:14.480
According to verse 4, Jehovah, the supreme judge, has delegated authority to judge to Jesus Christ

00:21:14.559 --> 00:21:22.240
and His co-rulers. Whom will they be judging? Not merely the great crowd who have survived Armageddon,

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:30.160
but billions of others who will be resurrected from the dead. And at the end of the millennial reign,

00:21:31.279 --> 00:21:38.640
death itself will finally be gone. It's hurled into the lake of fire as irretrievable as a piece

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:46.299
of paper thrown into a raging furnace. What will life be like under Kingdom rule?

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:58.589
How we love the promises at Revelation 21 verse 4, and God will wipe out every tear from their eyes.

00:21:59.549 --> 00:22:15.089
And death will be no more, neither will morning nor outcry nor pain be anymore.

00:22:16.609 --> 00:22:25.730
Just think of what this will mean. The death will hear and listen to the sounds of gentle rains,

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:52.269
happy people, bird song, and beautiful music. The blind will see examined starry skies

00:22:53.470 --> 00:23:00.720
and behold rainbows. They will watch animals and children at play.

00:23:04.799 --> 00:23:11.359
Mankind will experience miraculous healing on a global scale.

00:23:12.079 --> 00:23:24.960
Those once disabled or elderly will hike through a forest, climb a mountain, or run on a sandy beach.

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:38.880
Gone will be hunger, sickness and injustice. There will be no wicked people. Everyone will live

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:50.990
in perfect health, security and happiness, and do so forever. Think deeply about these promises.

00:23:52.509 --> 00:24:02.430
Engage your senses. Let's conclude by reading a passage from the final chapter of Revelation.

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:10.109
Chapter 22, which describes other blessings that will come from earth's righteous rulers.

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:21.869
And he showed me a river of water of life, clear as crystal flowing out from the throne of God and of the Lamb,

00:24:21.869 --> 00:24:31.710
down the middle of its main street. On both sides of the river were trees of life, producing 12 crops of fruit,

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:38.910
yielding their fruit each month, and the leaves of the trees were for the healing of the nations.

00:24:39.869 --> 00:24:48.190
And there will no longer be any curse. But the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city,

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:56.589
and his slaves will offer him sacred service, and they will see his face, and his name will be on

00:24:56.589 --> 00:25:05.150
their foreheads. Also, night will be no more, and they have no need of lamp light or sunlight.

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:13.869
For Jehovah God will shed light upon them, and they will rule as kings forever and ever.

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:15.710
He said to me,

00:25:17.759 --> 00:25:25.680
These words are faithful and true. Yes, Jehovah, the God who inspired the prophets,

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:34.000
has sent his angel to show his slaves the things that must shortly take place. Look, I am coming quickly.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:39.279
Happy is anyone observing the words of the prophecy of this scroll.

00:25:40.559 --> 00:25:43.920
Do you long to worship Jehovah in perfect health,

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:52.079
under perfect rule, in a perfect world? Our king longs for that day too.

00:25:53.680 --> 00:26:00.480
The angel tells John that these things must shortly take place. And speaking in Jesus' name,

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.680
the angel says, I am coming quickly.

00:26:05.599 --> 00:26:11.839
Today's world presents many problems, but Jesus will solve them all.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:18.799
He's announced that false religion will soon end. He'll defeat the rest of this system of things

00:26:18.799 --> 00:26:24.240
at the War of Armageddon. He'll abyss and eventually destroy that despicable serpent,

00:26:24.319 --> 00:26:30.160
Satan the devil, and soon he'll eliminate the last enemy, death.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:38.880
These things will happen. Should we ever have any doubts? Remember the angels' words.

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:46.720
These words are faithful and true. What good news for all of us who support our king,

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:55.119
Christ Jesus. Yes, we echo the Apostle John's words in verse 20. Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.
