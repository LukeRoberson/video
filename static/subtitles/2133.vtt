00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:10.919
Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations.

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:18.920
With those words, Jesus commissioned His followers to share the good news about the kingdom of God.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:27.920
This message brought comfort for those distressed and made available the hope of everlasting life for all mankind.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.920
It's by means of God's kingdom that this will be accomplished.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.920
In our day, the same message is being conveyed on a much larger scale.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:46.920
For over 100 years, Jehovah's Witnesses have been organized for this very purpose.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.920
They speak this message in hundreds of languages.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:04.920
They deliver it in more than 230 land, bringing solace to millions in a troubled world.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.920
It has become the greatest preaching campaign the world has ever known.
