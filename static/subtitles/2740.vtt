00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:16.899
We were always just called the Bible students, and brother Russell kind of encouraged that.

00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:23.620
He said, we didn't want to be known by any distinctive name, just Bible students.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.100
And I appreciated his viewpoint on that.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.780
The trouble was that people began to call us Russellites and Rutherfordites.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.740
Not only that, but the term Christian itself became a misnomer.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:43.619
Many people said there were Christians, and they didn't have any ideas to what a Christian meant.

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:51.820
Their identity would be considered at a seven-day convention held in Columbus, Ohio in 1931.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.500
Attendees received programs with the puzzling letters J.W. on the cover.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:08.469
Speaking on Isaiah 43-10, J.F. Rutherford presented a resolution.

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:18.790
We have great love for Brother Charles T. Russell, and we gladly acknowledge that the Lord used him and greatly blessed his work.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.750
Yet we cannot consent to be called by the name Russellites.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:33.829
The Watchtower Bible and Tracks Society and the International Bible Students Association are merely names of corporations.

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:41.030
We are servants of Jehovah God, commissioned to do work in His name.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.870
Henceforth, may it be known that we are Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:02:08.229
Early editions of Zion's Watchtower reveal that the Bible students had already known God's name.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:18.069
But now, their new designation would remind these Christians that knowledge brings responsibility to bear witness.

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:28.870
So, at that particular time, we went from being a vague group of persons who were joined together by a common interest in studying the Scriptures

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.550
to being a scriptural identity that we could stand up and be proud of.
