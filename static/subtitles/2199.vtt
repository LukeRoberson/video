00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:08.129
My name is Thomas Roman.

00:01:08.129 --> 00:01:17.180
I came into the truth in my mid-twenties.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.180
Work was always important to me.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:29.069
He's getting stalled. We're looking at catastrophic line failures.

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:31.069
Think, negligence.

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:37.069
But now, I realize that I spent too much time there, instead of with my family.

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:40.540
Rest of work, Monica.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.540
My wife, Monica, went to work some years ago.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:50.129
Our jobs became a preoccupation,

00:01:50.129 --> 00:01:53.129
which took a toll on our family.

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:57.109
Yes, honey. What is it?

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:58.109
Hey, babe.

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:00.109
How about we all have dinner together tonight?

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:05.150
Maybe we should try family worship too.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.150
It's been forever.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.150
Okay. Well, anyway. See you later then. Love you.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.460
Good work. You can get started on your job.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.460
Our daughter, Rebecca, got caught up in after-school activities.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.460
Oh, front page.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.460
A class project put her in close company with a non-witness student.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:30.030
I can work up for me the premise, the standards, the arguments,

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.030
and the assessment for the next issue on this docket.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.569
Marcus is our oldest son.

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:36.569
Yo, Marcus.

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:37.569
I heard you get up.

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.569
He was absorbed in his music place.

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:40.569
A crazy.

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.569
Hey, I'm having a party in a couple weeks.

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.569
You've got to do the music.

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.569
It drew him into association with the wrong kind of people.

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.569
Beats like this will get you places.

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.569
If something good happens, we'll talk money.

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:07.669
Our youngest, Nicholas, was often neglected.

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:11.180
We weren't a family.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.180
We were living separate lives.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.180
You can't go to school without breakfast.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.930
Nicholas, time to get a move on. We need to get...

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:40.789
Come on downstairs. Remember? Family worship?

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:43.789
No, dad. You said sex.

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:46.360
I didn't notice.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.270
Time for family worship. Let's go.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.270
I'm busy.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.270
That's not busy. Downstairs.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.270
Give me a break.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:04.580
Now!

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.580
My attempts to bring us together left a lot to be desired.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.090
So, here's what we're going to talk about.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:22.089
Why it's important to have a regular family study

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:31.899
so that all of us can rely on Jehovah.

00:04:31.899 --> 00:04:32.899
What?

00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:34.899
What would you know about that?

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:36.899
Rebecca.

00:04:36.899 --> 00:04:40.899
I break my back so that you won't have to struggle the way I have.

00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:43.899
You're never here. You usually work till 9 or 10 at night

00:04:43.899 --> 00:04:45.899
and then you sit there watching TV and go to sleep.

00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:48.899
Well, that's what Satan's system does to you.

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:50.899
Just wait until you get into the working world.

00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:51.899
You'll see.

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:53.899
So, as usual, I don't know what I'm talking about.

00:04:53.899 --> 00:04:55.899
Rebecca, stop it.

00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:57.899
Your father and I are doing the best that we can.

00:04:57.899 --> 00:04:59.899
Oh, really?

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:00.899
This is pointless.

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:03.899
Young man, you stay right where you are.

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:04.899
Sorry.

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:09.899
I'm just overwhelmed by the peace and spirituality of this family.

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:10.899
Marcus!

00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:12.899
Let him go, Thomas.

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:24.980
I have to go to the bathroom.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:25.980
What just happened here?

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.980
It's not your fault, Thomas.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:33.300
These teenagers are out of control.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.579
I'm exhausted.

00:05:36.579 --> 00:05:43.259
I'm going to grab a bite and watch some TV.

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:45.259
Join me.

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:47.259
No.

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:48.259
Go ahead.

00:05:48.259 --> 00:06:09.899
Hey, buddy.

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:10.899
Hi, daddy.

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:17.189
Not exactly a model family study.

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:18.189
It wasn't.

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:28.029
You know what I forgot.

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:55.629
How about a prayer?

00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:57.629
Let's make this world a better place.

00:06:57.629 --> 00:06:58.629
What's it going to be next?

00:06:58.629 --> 00:07:02.069
Creation versus evolution?

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:04.069
No. A relevant.

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:06.069
Nobody believes over it.

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:07.069
Genocide?

00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:08.069
Yeah, right.

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:11.069
Have fun getting a support team for that one.

00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:13.069
How about...

00:07:14.069 --> 00:07:16.069
gay marriage?

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:18.069
Why would you want to talk about that?

00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:19.069
It's a good topic.

00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:22.069
High profile, polarized opinions,

00:07:22.069 --> 00:07:26.069
with a follow-up article for the school paper.

00:07:26.069 --> 00:07:29.069
What would be our position?

00:07:29.069 --> 00:07:32.069
My philosophy on life,

00:07:32.069 --> 00:07:34.069
acceptance and tolerance,

00:07:34.069 --> 00:07:36.069
to a fault.

00:07:36.069 --> 00:07:39.069
So you support same sex marriage?

00:07:39.069 --> 00:07:41.069
People just want to be happy.

00:07:41.069 --> 00:07:44.069
I totally support that.

00:07:44.069 --> 00:07:46.069
You don't have a problem with it, dude.

00:07:46.069 --> 00:07:51.089
Have I told you I'm one of Joe's witnesses?

00:07:51.089 --> 00:07:53.089
No.

00:07:53.089 --> 00:07:55.089
That's cool.

00:07:55.089 --> 00:07:57.089
I totally respect that.

00:07:57.089 --> 00:08:03.170
In fact, it kind of explains a lot.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:08.019
Meaning?

00:08:08.019 --> 00:08:09.019
Meaning...

00:08:09.019 --> 00:08:11.019
You've got...

00:08:11.019 --> 00:08:13.019
Death.

00:08:13.019 --> 00:08:15.019
You're not obsessed over...

00:08:16.019 --> 00:08:18.019
Girl styles.

00:08:18.019 --> 00:08:19.019
You're just...

00:08:19.019 --> 00:08:21.019
You're you.

00:08:21.019 --> 00:08:23.019
And...

00:08:23.019 --> 00:08:26.680
I like that the best.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.680
Martin, the system is so messed up.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.680
How do you do it?

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.679
Do what?

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:35.679
Everything.

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:37.679
Career, family,

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:38.679
elder,

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:39.679
pioneer,

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:41.679
simple life.

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:44.679
Even the basics seem more than we can manage.

00:08:44.679 --> 00:08:54.740
Something's off track.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:55.740
What do you mean?

00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:00.120
Life used to be so simple.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.120
Now it's so...

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.120
complicated.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.120
What happened?

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.120
First, you know our care a lot about your family.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.120
Always have.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.120
Here's my question.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:19.059
What made your life so complicated?

00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:21.059
The kids.

00:09:21.059 --> 00:09:25.399
My boss.

00:09:25.399 --> 00:09:26.399
Self-satan.

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:28.399
Who knows?

00:09:28.399 --> 00:09:31.399
I don't have any control over anything anymore.

00:09:31.399 --> 00:09:33.399
Balance is tough to find.

00:09:33.399 --> 00:09:35.399
You should have seen our family worship the other night, Martin.

00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:37.399
It was a...

00:09:37.399 --> 00:09:39.399
circus.

00:09:39.399 --> 00:09:45.350
Before we even got started, the kids were looking for reasons to jump ship.

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:49.210
In the end, it was just Nicholas and me.

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:52.210
It felt like a fool.

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:54.210
Have you tried the suggestions in our Kingdom Ministry?

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:56.210
Like watching one of our videos?

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:58.210
Oh, we've seen them all.

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:02.960
Bible games?

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.960
They're very creative.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.960
Singing?

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.960
Can't carry a tune in a bucket.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.960
And now who's making excuses?

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:19.720
Sorry.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.720
Don't expect you to solve our problems.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.720
Anyway, how are things with you and Isabel?

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.720
Well, I've turned into my letter of resignation today.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.720
Wow.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.720
You actually did it.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.720
We thought it through and worked out a plan.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.720
You know, we're confident Jehovah's going to bless our efforts.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.720
You know, the kids are on their own.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.720
So now's the time.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:49.379
I hope everything works out.

00:10:49.379 --> 00:10:52.379
You have something stashed away for a rainy day.

00:10:52.379 --> 00:10:54.379
Oh, we've counted the cost.

00:10:54.379 --> 00:10:58.379
In fact, that's another reason why I stopped by.

00:10:58.379 --> 00:11:01.379
We're doing the lease on our house with just Tias down here.

00:11:01.379 --> 00:11:04.379
So, well, we've decided to let the house go.

00:11:04.379 --> 00:11:08.379
Monica suggested that we rent your basement apartment for a month or two.

00:11:08.379 --> 00:11:10.379
What do you think?

00:11:10.379 --> 00:11:11.379
Of course.

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:13.379
You're welcome to stay.

00:11:13.379 --> 00:11:14.379
Forget the rent.

00:11:14.379 --> 00:11:15.379
Do you want to go see it?

00:11:15.379 --> 00:11:16.379
No.

00:11:16.379 --> 00:11:17.379
Next week will be fine.

00:11:17.379 --> 00:11:19.379
Rebecca?

00:11:19.379 --> 00:11:20.379
Where are you going?

00:11:20.379 --> 00:11:22.379
To a friend.

00:11:22.379 --> 00:11:23.379
Who?

00:11:23.379 --> 00:11:25.379
Dad, stop treating me like I'm 10.

00:11:25.379 --> 00:11:27.379
You're always embarrassing me in front of everyone.

00:11:27.379 --> 00:11:28.379
Just give me a name.

00:11:28.379 --> 00:11:29.379
Say hello to Brother Barrow.

00:11:29.379 --> 00:11:30.379
Oh, hi, Brother Barrow.

00:11:30.379 --> 00:11:31.379
Sorry, I got to run.

00:11:31.379 --> 00:11:33.379
Rebecca, you do not...

00:11:33.379 --> 00:11:34.379
Oh.

00:11:34.379 --> 00:11:38.779
You do not...

00:11:38.779 --> 00:11:40.779
You do not have permission to leave.

00:11:40.779 --> 00:11:43.440
Stop worrying.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:50.870
For driving.

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:51.870
Josh.

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:52.870
Hey.

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:53.870
Can you stay?

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:55.870
I have the line change over tonight.

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:56.870
Sorry, man.

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:58.870
My kids got little league tonight.

00:11:58.870 --> 00:11:59.870
Never miss a game.

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:00.870
Come on.

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:01.870
I always do the late stuff.

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:02.870
Help me out for once.

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:03.870
You got kids.

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:04.870
You know how it is.

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:08.460
Hey, Larry.

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:11.779
Can you come for me tonight?

00:12:11.779 --> 00:12:12.779
I got to get out of here.

00:12:12.779 --> 00:12:14.779
The time in a half would be great, but...

00:12:14.779 --> 00:12:15.779
What's your hurry?

00:12:15.779 --> 00:12:17.779
I promise the family would be doing something together tonight.

00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:18.779
Can't tonight.

00:12:18.779 --> 00:12:19.779
I'm already committed.

00:12:19.779 --> 00:12:20.779
Sorry.

00:12:20.779 --> 00:12:31.309
Next time.

00:12:31.309 --> 00:12:32.309
My heart was divided.

00:12:32.309 --> 00:12:39.850
And now...

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:41.850
I blame myself for the family failure.

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:51.549
Head's up, Nick.

00:12:51.549 --> 00:13:14.129
Hey, what'd you do with the ball?

00:13:14.129 --> 00:13:16.129
It's dad and his little brother.

00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:18.129
Dad's got a little brother?

00:13:18.129 --> 00:13:19.129
Yeah.

00:13:19.129 --> 00:13:22.629
But he died a long time ago.

00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:23.629
What happened?

00:13:23.629 --> 00:13:24.629
I don't know.

00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:26.629
He won't talk about it.

00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:27.629
Here.

00:13:27.629 --> 00:13:28.629
We'll use this instead.

00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:36.990
This is perfect.

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:41.700
But it...

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.700
Looks like we're kicking somebody out.

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:44.700
Oh, no.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:45.700
No.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.700
Marcus and his friends used to play music down here.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:14:03.730
Doesn't get much use at all these days.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:05.730
You're sure it's not an imposition?

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:09.899
No.

00:14:09.899 --> 00:14:11.899
Not at all.

00:14:11.899 --> 00:14:13.899
The kitchen's right over here.

00:14:13.899 --> 00:14:18.620
This thing's leaking again.

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:23.299
I'll fix it right now.

00:14:23.299 --> 00:14:25.299
So you can move in tomorrow night.

00:14:25.299 --> 00:14:32.370
Isn't that your family worship night?

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:34.370
Yeah, well, Martin.

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:37.370
Honestly, I don't think it'll make a bit of difference

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:39.370
if we miss it again.

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:41.370
No, Thomas.

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:43.370
Consistency is important.

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:48.860
I doubt I'll ever make a success of family worship.

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:49.860
Why do you say that?

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.860
Well...

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.860
Let's just say that teaching has never been one of my strong suits.

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:57.860
Even if that were true.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.860
Teaching your children is still your responsibility.

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:07.889
Then as the kids got older,

00:15:07.889 --> 00:15:09.889
I started working more.

00:15:09.889 --> 00:15:12.889
And then Monica started to work to keep up with the bills.

00:15:12.889 --> 00:15:15.889
I just virtual routines with the hit.

00:15:15.889 --> 00:15:17.889
Do you think we should have been stricter?

00:15:17.889 --> 00:15:21.889
Well, some children need more discipline than others.

00:15:21.889 --> 00:15:26.889
But they all respond to patience, love, and concern.

00:15:26.889 --> 00:15:30.889
Yeah, well, I guess there's no formula for racing kids, huh?

00:15:30.889 --> 00:15:33.889
Actually, there is.

00:15:33.889 --> 00:15:35.889
Deuteronomy.

00:15:35.889 --> 00:15:36.889
Six, six and seven.

00:15:36.889 --> 00:15:38.889
Oh, yeah.

00:15:38.889 --> 00:15:41.889
When you walk on the road, when you lie down, when you get up.

00:15:41.889 --> 00:15:49.820
But do you remember how verse six begins?

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.820
Not off the top of my head, no?

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:54.820
These words must be on your heart.

00:15:54.820 --> 00:16:03.299
If you aren't serious about God's word, can you expect your kids to be?

00:16:03.299 --> 00:16:08.379
I suppose you're going to ask me about my personal study.

00:16:08.379 --> 00:16:11.379
Think of family worship as the central water supply

00:16:11.379 --> 00:16:15.379
that your family's life depends upon.

00:16:15.379 --> 00:16:19.379
If the water dries up, everybody suffers.

00:16:19.379 --> 00:16:25.399
Yeah, well, you can lead a horse to water.

00:16:25.399 --> 00:16:27.399
You can't make them drink.

00:16:27.399 --> 00:16:28.399
Coffee?

00:16:28.399 --> 00:16:37.019
Is it too late?

00:16:37.019 --> 00:16:47.250
How can I reach them at this point?

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:49.250
Don't give up on them.

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:52.250
They'd sense that and they may give up too.

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:59.970
Use every opportunity to inculcate God's word into their hearts.

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:08.029
Try to eat together, at least once a day.

00:17:08.029 --> 00:17:10.029
You can't help but talk.

00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:15.400
Sometimes days go by where I don't even see my kids.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:19.769
Use the time on the road.

00:17:19.769 --> 00:17:22.769
You know, two and from meetings to talk.

00:17:22.769 --> 00:17:26.769
Honestly, I don't have a clue about what's going on with them.

00:17:26.769 --> 00:17:31.519
Then find out.

00:17:31.519 --> 00:17:33.519
Ask them.

00:17:33.519 --> 00:17:35.519
You know, then really listen.

00:17:35.519 --> 00:17:38.519
Try to grasp what they're thinking.

00:17:38.519 --> 00:17:43.859
There's your family worship material.

00:17:43.859 --> 00:17:46.859
I feel like such a failure.

00:17:46.859 --> 00:17:50.859
Working my fingers to the bone is sacrifice.

00:17:50.859 --> 00:17:54.740
And this is what I get.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:18:00.720
But are you making the right sacrifices?

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:06.730
What's more important than being with your kids?

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:12.869
That's the only way you're going to reach their hearts.

00:18:12.869 --> 00:18:16.980
Next topic.

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:20.980
The correlation between controversial debate and deforestation.

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:22.980
Well, there's no shortage of material.

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:24.980
Real?

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:26.980
Well, can't use any of these.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:28.980
Should really avoid that whole religion angle.

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:29.980
How can we?

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:31.980
That's at the heart of the issue.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:32.980
I don't think so.

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:36.980
I think it's more about personal identity and lifestyle.

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:37.980
Come on.

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:42.980
Didn't religious training shape your personal identity and lifestyle?

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:44.980
I used to go to church with my grandparents.

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:47.980
You know, with eye kingdom coming, all that stuff.

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:48.980
I don't know Rebecca.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.980
I mean, the Bible.

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:52.980
Don't you think it's just kind of random?

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:54.980
No, not really.

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:56.980
We get lots of help.

00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:00.980
Books, magazines, active discussions on the Bible's relevance.

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:03.980
Really, it makes a lot of sense.

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:08.980
And on your recommendation, I'll give it a fair chance sometimes.

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:16.980
But if Miss Holbrook's great debate turns into some religious cat fight, we are toast.

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:18.980
So you'd really do that?

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:20.980
Really do what?

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:23.980
Give the Bible a fair chance.

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:24.980
Yeah.

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:26.980
Of course.

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:28.980
Acceptance and tolerance.

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:39.250
You know, you really do have a very beautiful smile.

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:42.250
It's just so easy to talk to.

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:57.089
You make me wonder if there's life beyond these walls.

00:19:57.089 --> 00:19:59.089
Of course.

00:19:59.089 --> 00:20:00.089
Really?

00:20:00.089 --> 00:20:08.700
Well, I think we should investigate.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.700
What about family worship tonight?

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:12.700
I've got things to do.

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:19.839
Becca says you don't like family worship because you don't really believe in Jehovah.

00:20:19.839 --> 00:20:25.650
Isn't she?

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:30.650
Nicholas, nobody has a monopoly on truth.

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:33.650
What do you mean?

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:38.650
Maybe Jehovah didn't create everything exactly the way we think he did.

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:41.650
The Bible says he created everything.

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:44.650
Look, you're just a kid.

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:49.650
But soon you'll be learning things at school that will open your eyes.

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:52.650
Like what?

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:54.650
You'll find out soon enough.

00:20:54.650 --> 00:21:02.460
I gotta go.

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:03.460
Don't worry about me, little man.

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:04.460
I'm good.

00:21:04.460 --> 00:22:14.750
Dad, are we really gonna do this every week?

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:16.750
That's my aim, Becca.

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:17.750
But why now?

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:19.750
All of a sudden.

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:21.750
We should have been doing it all along.

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:23.750
Hey, Daddy, I have an idea for next week.

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:24.750
Let's hear it.

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:28.750
Did Jehovah create everything exactly the way we think he did?

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:32.960
Where did that come from?

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.960
Oh, and can I invite someone to sit in some time?

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.960
Who did you have in mind?

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.960
I've been talking to the sky at school about the Bible.

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.960
He seems to be shunned some interest.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.960
Becca has a boyfriend.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.960
Stop it. I do not.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.960
He's interested in the truth, Dad.

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.960
Here's another idea for next week.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.960
What does Jehovah think about boyfriend?

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:54.960
Mind your own business.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:58.960
For now, is that it would be good for us to practice the songs for the meeting?

00:22:58.960 --> 00:22:59.960
Nice idea.

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:03.259
No, Mom.

00:23:03.259 --> 00:23:07.660
Music on the website.

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:09.660
Good thinking, Nico. Pull it up.

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:11.660
Well, we choose which song to sing.

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:12.660
Dad, please.

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:14.660
What's wrong with singing?

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:15.660
I don't feel like it.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:16.660
Why not?

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:17.660
It's weird.

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:20.660
All of us sitting here by ourselves singing Kingdom Songs.

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:25.829
What's your favorite?

00:23:25.829 --> 00:23:26.829
We'll sing it.

00:23:26.829 --> 00:23:28.829
I don't have any favorites.

00:23:28.829 --> 00:23:32.829
Becca, don't you like any of our songs?

00:23:32.829 --> 00:23:34.829
Yeah, some of them.

00:23:34.829 --> 00:23:40.160
Which ones? Tell us.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.160
Song 134 is nice.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.160
See yourself when all is new.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:47.160
Why do you like that one?

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:51.160
It helps me picture myself in the new world.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:55.559
It makes me feel good.

00:23:55.559 --> 00:23:58.559
Okay, then. That's the one.

00:23:58.559 --> 00:24:00.559
Got it, Nico?

00:24:00.559 --> 00:24:02.559
I wish Marcus were here.

00:24:02.559 --> 00:24:05.559
He could play it for us on his guitar.

00:24:05.559 --> 00:24:07.559
Don't worry, little buddy.

00:24:07.559 --> 00:24:11.559
Marcus will be back with us eventually.

00:24:11.559 --> 00:24:12.559
You'll see.

00:24:12.559 --> 00:24:14.559
Okay, Amistro, song number 134.

00:24:14.559 --> 00:24:15.559
Please.

00:24:15.559 --> 00:24:23.019
Play!

00:24:23.019 --> 00:24:26.019
Just see your sound.

00:24:26.019 --> 00:24:29.019
Just see me, too.

00:24:29.019 --> 00:24:37.019
Just see us all in new encounter.

00:24:37.019 --> 00:24:41.460
You'll feel, but we'll be.

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:54.859
It's illegal to text while driving, you know.

00:24:54.859 --> 00:24:57.859
I know that. Give that back. It's none of your business.

00:24:57.859 --> 00:24:58.859
Who is this?

00:24:58.859 --> 00:24:59.859
Nobody.

00:24:59.859 --> 00:25:00.859
Try again.

00:25:00.859 --> 00:25:02.859
How about Justin?

00:25:02.859 --> 00:25:04.859
Will you stop it?

00:25:04.859 --> 00:25:06.859
What's this guy texting you for?

00:25:06.859 --> 00:25:09.859
Nothing. We just ended up on the same project.

00:25:09.859 --> 00:25:12.859
Good morning, beautiful.

00:25:12.859 --> 00:25:15.859
Seriously, project.

00:25:15.859 --> 00:25:18.859
How involved are you with Mr. Fence Rider?

00:25:18.859 --> 00:25:22.859
He's not a Fence Rider. He's tolerant and open-minded.

00:25:22.859 --> 00:25:24.859
And I'm not involved. Would you give that back?

00:25:24.859 --> 00:25:25.859
You see.

00:25:25.859 --> 00:25:27.859
And why are you defending it?

00:25:27.859 --> 00:25:29.859
Who are you to lecture me?

00:25:29.859 --> 00:25:31.859
You can stand a little involvement in anything.

00:25:31.859 --> 00:25:33.859
Hey, mind your own business.

00:25:33.859 --> 00:25:35.859
Why are you so...

00:25:35.859 --> 00:25:38.859
Look, back off, okay?

00:25:38.859 --> 00:25:41.859
Maybe someday you'll actually start thinking for yourself.

00:25:41.859 --> 00:25:43.859
Everything is so black and white.

00:25:43.859 --> 00:25:44.859
Yes, as you.

00:25:44.859 --> 00:25:46.859
Yeah, and I'm not the only one.

00:25:46.859 --> 00:25:48.859
Oh, who else?

00:25:48.859 --> 00:25:50.859
Justin.

00:25:50.859 --> 00:25:51.859
Just forget it.

00:25:51.859 --> 00:25:58.319
Second Timothy 22.

00:25:58.319 --> 00:26:02.319
Flea from youthful desires.

00:26:02.319 --> 00:26:04.319
Then it says,

00:26:04.319 --> 00:26:08.819
pursue righteousness,

00:26:08.819 --> 00:26:11.819
along with those who call on God,

00:26:11.819 --> 00:26:17.890
meaning with fellow believers,

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:22.799
not a boy of the world.

00:26:22.799 --> 00:26:30.990
I wasn't sure if I would use it the first time Rebecca opened up,

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:36.880
but I wanted to have a scripture and an illustration ready

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:43.650
when the time was right.

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:46.650
You really want to know what I want in life,

00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:48.650
what I feel.

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:52.150
Of course.

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:53.150
What's the matter?

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:54.150
Nothing.

00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:59.759
You can talk to me, sweetie.

00:26:59.759 --> 00:27:01.759
Nothing. Everything is fine.

00:27:01.759 --> 00:27:21.500
Is this the boy you wanted to invite over?

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:26.500
Rebecca, remember we talked about boyfriends just the other night?

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.500
Did it make sense?

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:39.269
Yeah, I heard it all.

00:27:39.269 --> 00:27:42.269
Does Jehovah's point of view matter?

00:27:42.269 --> 00:27:45.269
Your mother and I only want to protect you.

00:27:45.269 --> 00:27:48.269
He's nicer and more open-minded than some of the brothers at the hall.

00:27:48.269 --> 00:27:50.269
He just needs our help.

00:27:50.269 --> 00:27:54.269
Becca, think.

00:27:54.269 --> 00:27:56.269
If your heart's already involved,

00:27:56.269 --> 00:27:59.269
then it just makes it more difficult to know whether he loves Jehovah

00:27:59.269 --> 00:28:03.269
and the truth or if he's just after you.

00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:05.269
So you don't want to help him?

00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:07.269
You're my priority.

00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:08.269
I'm your father.

00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:11.269
I can't stand by and watch you get hurt.

00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:13.269
He cares about me.

00:28:13.269 --> 00:28:14.269
So do I.

00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:17.269
Rebecca, don't you see what's happening to your heart?

00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:19.269
I don't think you want to know.

00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:34.700
Did I ever tell you what happened when I first started seeing your mom?

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:39.700
I had to fly all the way to the old country because her father just had to meet me.

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:43.549
His first words to me were,

00:28:43.549 --> 00:28:46.960
who are you?

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.960
I said,

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.960
I'm Thomas Roman, the guy Monica's been telling you about.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:53.960
He was no.

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:58.140
Who are you?

00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:05.099
Are you a decent man?

00:29:05.099 --> 00:29:09.559
Why do you think he asked that?

00:29:09.559 --> 00:29:11.559
He was concerned from mom.

00:29:11.559 --> 00:29:14.130
Yeah.

00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:17.130
Fathers are concerned about their daughters.

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:19.130
It's what we do.

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:21.130
Then give Justin a chance.

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:26.130
He is a decent guy and he accepts me for who I am.

00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:31.130
But does he accept Jehovah's standard of what is decent?

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:33.130
Becca,

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:36.130
tolerance must have boundaries.

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:53.950
Deicency is the boundary for tolerance.

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:58.700
You see this?

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.700
We made 10,000 of these at work.

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:03.700
See this part here?

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:05.700
You can't really see it,

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:08.700
but it's just a hair outside the tolerance.

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:10.700
If this were to be used,

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:14.700
a very expensive piece of machinery would be junk within minutes.

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:16.700
Dad, you don't understand.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:18.700
I'm not a machine.

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:20.700
Day in and day out,

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:22.700
I feel like an outcast for what I believe.

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:25.700
But I'm okay with that because I really do believe it.

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:27.700
I love Jehovah.

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:32.700
But Justin doesn't judge me or anybody else.

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:35.700
I'm proud of you for making the truth your own.

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.700
And I know it's not easy.

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:42.700
But if Justin accepts things that are outside the boundaries

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:45.700
of Jehovah's standard of decency,

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:48.700
he can get you to accept them too.

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:52.700
And that can ruin your relationship with Jehovah.

00:30:52.700 --> 00:31:17.490
And your whole life.

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:20.180
You're Rebecca.

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:23.180
And if I don't do everything that I can to protect you.

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:27.589
And I'd be more negligent than I've already been.

00:31:27.589 --> 00:31:34.619
That was such a good movie.

00:31:34.619 --> 00:31:36.619
The plot was so thin.

00:31:36.619 --> 00:31:39.619
It was a love story. That was the plot.

00:31:39.619 --> 00:31:41.619
Yeah, the typical formula.

00:31:41.619 --> 00:31:44.619
Girl hates Guy because she thinks he's shallow.

00:31:44.619 --> 00:31:46.619
Guy hates Girl because he thinks she's stuck up.

00:31:46.619 --> 00:31:49.619
Their finer quality shine to overcome a common struggle.

00:31:49.619 --> 00:31:51.619
They fall hopelessly in love

00:31:51.619 --> 00:31:54.619
and they live happily ever after.

00:31:54.619 --> 00:31:58.619
It's too bad real life isn't as simple as in the movies.

00:31:58.619 --> 00:31:59.619
Yeah.

00:31:59.619 --> 00:32:04.619
I mean, sometimes it is like one of those really complex

00:32:04.619 --> 00:32:06.619
I-fi movies, you know?

00:32:06.619 --> 00:32:09.619
We have no clue where you are in space or time.

00:32:09.619 --> 00:32:11.619
What do you mean?

00:32:11.619 --> 00:32:14.619
Well, like relationships.

00:32:14.619 --> 00:32:17.619
You know, you got more than one thing going on

00:32:17.619 --> 00:32:20.619
and you're all confused.

00:32:20.619 --> 00:32:24.619
Okay, so like today is Friday

00:32:24.619 --> 00:32:27.619
and I'm with X tomorrow this Saturday

00:32:27.619 --> 00:32:31.619
and I'll be with Y and Z is text to me about Sunday.

00:32:31.619 --> 00:32:33.619
You've been there.

00:32:33.619 --> 00:32:39.940
Well, actually.

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:43.940
Hey, look, I'm okay with it.

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:45.940
I'm not trying to pry, honest.

00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:47.940
It's whatever.

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:48.940
You know, it's...

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:52.940
I'm sure you've been with guys before.

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:54.940
Hooking up is...

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:57.940
It's just part of the growth process.

00:32:57.940 --> 00:32:58.940
Here you go.

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:00.940
Green tea.

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:02.940
Pomegranate?

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:07.009
Thanks.

00:33:07.009 --> 00:33:14.690
Look, Rebecca, I expect you to continue growing

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:17.690
and I accept that.

00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:19.690
Acceptance and tolerance.

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:22.690
And it means the same for me, right?

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:27.430
How?

00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:29.779
Talk with them.

00:33:29.779 --> 00:33:30.779
Work with them.

00:33:30.779 --> 00:33:33.779
You know, let them know that their happiness is important to you.

00:33:33.779 --> 00:33:36.779
You know, and keep Jehovah involved in their lives.

00:33:36.779 --> 00:33:39.779
This system has a spread so thin.

00:33:39.779 --> 00:33:43.779
By the time we're all together, the damage is done.

00:33:43.779 --> 00:33:45.779
Well, you can't completely control their environment.

00:33:45.779 --> 00:33:48.779
But if you prepare them to deal with bad associates

00:33:48.779 --> 00:33:52.779
in whatever form, you've gone a long way to protecting them.

00:33:52.779 --> 00:33:57.630
How can I fight against everything?

00:33:57.630 --> 00:34:01.630
Don't give up and don't give in.

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:03.630
You know, replace bad associates with good ones.

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:06.630
You're the best associates your kids can have.

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:11.389
And then there's a circuit overseer in his wife.

00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:13.389
And others in full-time service.

00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:17.889
Suppose I do all that.

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:22.059
And it still doesn't work.

00:34:22.059 --> 00:34:24.059
Well, Thomas, at the end of the day,

00:34:24.059 --> 00:34:26.059
each one is going to have to decide for himself

00:34:26.059 --> 00:34:29.059
whether he's going to serve Jehovah or not.

00:34:29.059 --> 00:34:33.059
But if we do our part to help them make wise decisions,

00:34:33.059 --> 00:34:35.059
Jehovah will do his part.

00:34:35.059 --> 00:34:39.070
Is everything okay?

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:42.070
Yeah, the boss lately has been wanting me to work even more.

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:43.070
Sorry.

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:44.070
Okay.

00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:45.070
Hello.

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:47.070
Yes, Mr. O'Connor.

00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:50.019
Sure.

00:34:50.019 --> 00:34:54.019
And I can be there in 20 minutes.

00:34:54.019 --> 00:34:55.019
Okay.

00:34:55.019 --> 00:35:01.280
Could you drop Monica and the kids up at the house?

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:03.280
It won't be a problem at all.

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.280
Thanks.

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:05.280
Okay.

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:06.280
And Martin.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:07.280
Yeah.

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:09.280
The next time the circuit overseer visits,

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:11.280
put us down for hospitality.

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.280
I'll be sure to do that.

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:20.250
So then how come people still believe in evolution?

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:24.250
People believe in what they want to believe in Nicholas.

00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:29.250
But what we believe in has to be based on what's really true.

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:31.250
And who would know the most about creation?

00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:34.250
Jehovah, the creator, or even the smartest person on earth?

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:44.099
I wish Marcus were here.

00:35:44.099 --> 00:35:46.099
I'm still not sure he'd be convinced.

00:35:46.099 --> 00:35:50.099
Each of us is responsible for strengthening his own convictions.

00:35:50.099 --> 00:35:52.099
So what are we going to do next week?

00:35:52.099 --> 00:35:53.099
Okay.

00:35:53.099 --> 00:35:54.099
Ready.

00:35:55.099 --> 00:35:59.099
The footage of the spirit has nine aspects, right?

00:35:59.099 --> 00:36:04.099
So everybody picks one and then explains how to display it in everyday life.

00:36:04.099 --> 00:36:07.099
I get love.

00:36:07.099 --> 00:36:08.099
Hmm.

00:36:08.099 --> 00:36:09.099
Goodness.

00:36:09.099 --> 00:36:12.099
Patience for me, obviously.

00:36:12.099 --> 00:36:15.099
I think I'd better take faith.

00:36:15.099 --> 00:36:17.099
Can I pick one for Marcus?

00:36:17.099 --> 00:36:20.699
Joy!

00:36:20.699 --> 00:36:22.699
Martin.

00:36:22.699 --> 00:36:23.699
Please come in.

00:36:23.699 --> 00:36:24.699
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:36:24.699 --> 00:36:26.699
I thought you'd be done by now.

00:36:26.699 --> 00:36:29.699
We lost track of time.

00:36:29.699 --> 00:36:32.699
But we wanted to invite the kids down to show them our model of Noah's Ark.

00:36:32.699 --> 00:36:35.699
You have an Ark? Where did you get it?

00:36:35.699 --> 00:36:38.699
Oh, we built it with our kids as a family project.

00:36:38.699 --> 00:36:40.699
Sure.

00:36:40.699 --> 00:36:42.699
When you come back up, we'll close with prayer.

00:36:42.699 --> 00:36:44.699
Come on, Becca. This is going to be cool.

00:36:44.699 --> 00:36:46.699
We won't be long.

00:36:46.699 --> 00:36:52.889
This is so awesome.

00:36:52.889 --> 00:36:56.889
Look, Becca even has little animals on the inside.

00:36:56.889 --> 00:36:58.889
Pretty cool.

00:36:58.889 --> 00:37:01.889
It makes you wonder what the real thing was like.

00:37:01.889 --> 00:37:04.889
You know, that's what gave us the idea to build a model.

00:37:04.889 --> 00:37:06.889
How'd you do this?

00:37:06.889 --> 00:37:07.889
It took some time.

00:37:07.889 --> 00:37:08.889
Believe me.

00:37:08.889 --> 00:37:11.889
Every week we do some research in the publications.

00:37:11.889 --> 00:37:14.889
I do it at Julia, compiled the details.

00:37:14.889 --> 00:37:17.889
And I saw in Jonathan, what's the draftsman?

00:37:17.889 --> 00:37:20.889
And we built it all together.

00:37:20.889 --> 00:37:21.889
Wow.

00:37:21.889 --> 00:37:25.889
Becca, we have got to do something like this.

00:37:25.889 --> 00:37:34.550
I can't stop thinking about what Rebecca said.

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:38.090
And about me always being at work.

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:40.090
There's a certain amount of truth in it.

00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:44.980
You only knew what it took to get home on time.

00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:46.980
I know, Thomas. Believe me.

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:47.980
I know.

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:57.980
It's sinking in that what the kids need most isn't money or things.

00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:59.980
They need us.

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:03.219
Fully involved in their lives.

00:38:03.219 --> 00:38:06.219
It's just so difficult balancing their needs

00:38:06.219 --> 00:38:08.219
with the demands of our jobs.

00:38:11.019 --> 00:38:13.019
I wonder what we can do about that.

00:38:13.019 --> 00:38:16.019
You and I don't even have time to talk anymore.

00:38:16.019 --> 00:38:22.019
I mean, really talk.

00:38:22.019 --> 00:38:26.989
If we could somehow cut back on work.

00:38:26.989 --> 00:38:28.989
Need both incomes.

00:38:28.989 --> 00:38:31.989
Maybe we just need to tighten our belts a little.

00:38:31.989 --> 00:38:35.989
With the debt that we carry and our regular expenses, I can't see how.

00:38:35.989 --> 00:38:40.780
Let's take one step at a time.

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:44.780
Maybe begin by comparing our expenses with our income.

00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:48.119
I'm worried.

00:38:48.119 --> 00:38:50.119
What if we can't make ends meet?

00:38:50.119 --> 00:39:16.420
If we put spiritual things first, Jova said he'd help us.

00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:26.300
Dad, this is the coolest thing ever!

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:29.300
Though I wish Becca had come.

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:32.300
I think she would have liked this.

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:34.300
So, how big was the arc?

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:38.969
You've got the measurements right there, Nico.

00:39:38.969 --> 00:39:39.969
Oh, yeah.

00:39:39.969 --> 00:39:42.969
Three hundred by fifty by thirty qubits.

00:39:42.969 --> 00:39:44.969
That's longer than a football field.

00:39:44.969 --> 00:39:49.269
It's way taller than our house.

00:39:49.269 --> 00:39:51.269
Hey, who's here?

00:39:51.269 --> 00:39:52.269
Becca!

00:39:52.269 --> 00:39:55.900
It's a fridge and we're going to make it.

00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:57.900
So, where's Noah's arc?

00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:02.900
Well, we're standing right about in the middle of it on the ground floor.

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:04.900
Wow, it's huge.

00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:06.900
I know, right?

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:07.900
Glad you came.

00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:09.900
Come on, Becca. I'll show you how we measured it.

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:14.340
Thank you, Jova.

00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:25.079
Thomas, thanks so much for your kindness.

00:40:25.079 --> 00:40:29.000
Keep in touch.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.000
Okay?

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.000
You know we will.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.590
Hey, buddy.

00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:36.590
I'm going to miss you.

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:48.199
Why do you have to go away?

00:40:48.199 --> 00:40:51.199
Remember what we talked about?

00:40:51.199 --> 00:40:53.199
Matthew 633.

00:40:53.199 --> 00:40:58.670
You see, first, the kingdom.

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:03.670
You know, Marcus, there's nothing better than letting Jova direct you.

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:08.849
You'll go places in life.

00:41:08.849 --> 00:41:10.849
I'm going to miss you.

00:41:10.849 --> 00:41:31.099
I'm going to miss you too, baby girl.

00:41:31.099 --> 00:41:37.099
Jeremiah 179 says that the heart is treacherous and desperate.

00:41:37.099 --> 00:41:44.570
Marcus had allowed the desire of his heart to crowd out his love for the truth.

00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:53.380
The time had come for me to try to reinstill God's word on his heart.

00:41:53.380 --> 00:42:03.980
I knew I'd need to be calm but firm about what I expected.

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:04.980
What do you want?

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:23.650
Just to talk.

00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:27.239
About these?

00:42:27.239 --> 00:42:32.150
You're the one who took them.

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:37.199
No, Nicholas got a hold of him.

00:42:37.199 --> 00:42:39.199
What's the big deal?

00:42:39.199 --> 00:42:51.699
It's something I'm good at.

00:42:51.699 --> 00:42:53.699
I listened to some of this.

00:42:53.699 --> 00:42:56.699
Would you actually do the things these lyrics are about?

00:42:56.699 --> 00:42:59.699
Look, I just do the music.

00:42:59.699 --> 00:43:01.699
All right?

00:43:01.699 --> 00:43:08.159
Besides, I know right from wrong.

00:43:08.159 --> 00:43:11.159
Then why lend your talents to what you know is wrong?

00:43:11.159 --> 00:43:21.590
Marcus, it's not just the music.

00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:30.539
We've lost focus as a family.

00:43:30.539 --> 00:43:36.500
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:42.300
You used to love going to the meetings.

00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:46.300
And if there was a Saturday where I was too tired for service,

00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:52.820
you were the one who would dog me until I got up and went anyway.

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:54.820
You had a passion for the truth.

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:59.630
What happened?

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:01.630
Maybe I just grew up.

00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:13.030
People don't outgrow happiness.

00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:16.440
Something else chokes it out.

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:18.440
Well, try taking a look in the mirror.

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:30.650
I've been doing a lot of that lately.

00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:38.699
I blame myself for where we're at right now.

00:44:38.699 --> 00:44:47.059
I've been slacking off spiritually, making you find your own way.

00:44:47.059 --> 00:44:50.059
I ignored what you were feeding your heart.

00:44:50.059 --> 00:44:57.239
It's time for some changes.

00:44:57.239 --> 00:45:00.969
What do you want from me?

00:45:00.969 --> 00:45:01.969
Six months.

00:45:01.969 --> 00:45:10.650
Six months.

00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:12.650
A full involvement.

00:45:12.650 --> 00:45:17.650
Meetings, field service, daily Bible reading, the works.

00:45:17.650 --> 00:45:22.650
And then, if you don't think that you're happier than you are now,

00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:32.360
then, then fine.

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:38.550
We'll talk about what to do next.

00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:44.550
How about you let me live my life my way?

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:48.550
Let me make my own decisions, my own mistakes.

00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:54.550
You have no idea what you're saying.

00:45:54.550 --> 00:46:01.550
Do you really think that the mistakes that we make

00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:03.550
don't affect other people?

00:46:03.550 --> 00:46:47.820
I guess it's time you learn the whole story about your uncle Marcus.

00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:57.070
When I turned 16, what I wanted more than anything in the world

00:46:57.070 --> 00:47:00.070
was a muscle car.

00:47:00.070 --> 00:47:04.760
So it worked and I saved.

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:06.760
And I got my car.

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:13.340
Well, a good is a car like that if you don't run it.

00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:18.340
And when you run a car like that, the friends that you make

00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:24.070
don't always have your best interest at heart.

00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:34.190
So after one particular day of racing, drinking, beer,

00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:38.190
that I wasn't old enough to have anyway,

00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:43.190
my faults asked me to watch over my little brother.

00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:46.190
Only as far as the railroad tracks in the back.

00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:47.190
That's it.

00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:49.949
Cool.

00:47:49.949 --> 00:47:58.130
They didn't know where I'd been.

00:47:58.130 --> 00:48:14.199
What I'd been up to.

00:48:15.199 --> 00:49:28.739
Just like Jeremiah 17 says, my heart was treacherous.

00:49:28.739 --> 00:49:34.989
I named you Marcus.

00:49:34.989 --> 00:49:46.500
Not just to remember my brother, but to remind me that my decisions,

00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:52.610
my mistakes affect other people.

00:49:52.610 --> 00:50:11.199
Even you son, I believe that you want to do what's right.

00:50:11.199 --> 00:50:14.199
But you need to be at family worship,

00:50:14.199 --> 00:50:18.199
to strengthen your relationship with Jehovah, starting next week.

00:50:18.199 --> 00:51:26.260
And son, this is not optional.

00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:30.840
How are you feeling?

00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:37.349
I'm just so confused.

00:51:37.349 --> 00:51:40.349
I never find someone in the truth.

00:51:40.349 --> 00:51:42.349
You know I love you.

00:51:42.349 --> 00:51:45.349
And I'm always here for you if you want to talk.

00:51:45.349 --> 00:52:00.929
Things get pretty complicated sometimes.

00:52:00.929 --> 00:52:09.789
Your father and I allowed life to get so complicated that

00:52:09.789 --> 00:52:12.789
we lost sight of some very important things.

00:52:12.789 --> 00:52:18.000
You know what helped?

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:26.900
What?

00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:32.900
It can be like a compass if you let it.

00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:39.389
Here, Mark 1230.

00:52:39.389 --> 00:52:44.389
And you must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart

00:52:44.389 --> 00:52:48.389
and with your whole soul and with your whole mind

00:52:48.389 --> 00:52:50.389
and with your whole strength.

00:52:50.389 --> 00:52:59.039
And there be room in our heart for things that Jehovah doesn't tolerate.

00:52:59.039 --> 00:53:10.610
Satan wants us to think that all beliefs and any actions are acceptable.

00:53:10.610 --> 00:53:13.610
But that's a lie.

00:53:13.610 --> 00:53:27.900
It doesn't line up with the compass.

00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:32.179
I can't see what your future holds, honey.

00:53:32.179 --> 00:53:34.179
But I promise you this.

00:53:34.179 --> 00:53:37.179
If these words are in your heart,

00:53:37.179 --> 00:53:41.179
you'll never look back on life with regrets.

00:53:41.179 --> 00:53:44.179
That and I want you to be truly happy.

00:53:44.179 --> 00:54:00.579
I've just been thinking a lot lately and trying to do the right thing.

00:54:00.579 --> 00:54:03.579
Well, tell me. We tell each other everything.

00:54:03.579 --> 00:54:05.579
Is this something I did?

00:54:05.579 --> 00:54:07.579
No, no, of course not.

00:54:07.579 --> 00:54:08.579
Hey.

00:54:08.579 --> 00:54:09.579
I'll catch up with you later.

00:54:09.579 --> 00:54:11.579
See ya.

00:54:11.579 --> 00:54:12.579
Hey, guess what?

00:54:12.579 --> 00:54:13.579
What?

00:54:13.579 --> 00:54:17.579
Mr. Ramonathan wants me on the editorial staff.

00:54:17.579 --> 00:54:18.579
Congratulations.

00:54:18.579 --> 00:54:19.579
Well.

00:54:19.579 --> 00:54:21.579
With you is the editor in chief, of course.

00:54:21.579 --> 00:54:27.059
We're back. What's wrong?

00:54:27.059 --> 00:54:30.059
I need to tell you something.

00:54:30.059 --> 00:54:38.730
Sure. Anything.

00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:41.730
I don't think we should see each other anymore.

00:54:41.730 --> 00:54:44.010
What?

00:54:44.010 --> 00:54:51.199
I respect your tolerance.

00:54:51.199 --> 00:55:08.670
But what? Move. What Rebecca?

00:55:08.670 --> 00:55:12.050
I learned something.

00:55:12.050 --> 00:55:16.050
True tolerance has decency as its boundary.

00:55:16.050 --> 00:55:19.300
I don't get it.

00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:24.300
We have to accept some standard of right and wrong.

00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:27.300
Without that, nothing makes sense.

00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:29.300
Nothing works.

00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:32.300
But what does that have to do with us?

00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:38.300
Justin, you already told me that you plan on outgrowing our relationship.

00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:42.300
Come on, Rebecca. What do you expect from me?

00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:45.900
Nothing.

00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:51.900
But I try my best to live by Jehovah God's standard of decency.

00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:58.909
And to accept anything outside of that boundary is a dead end.

00:55:58.909 --> 00:56:00.909
Come on, Rebecca.

00:56:00.909 --> 00:56:01.909
Why not this again?

00:56:01.909 --> 00:56:04.909
I mean, why does it have to be so black and white?

00:56:04.909 --> 00:56:07.909
It's not about black and white.

00:56:07.909 --> 00:56:09.909
It's about right and wrong.

00:56:09.909 --> 00:56:11.909
And loyalty.

00:56:11.909 --> 00:56:15.420
I just want to do what's right.

00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:17.420
But what about making the world a better place?

00:56:17.420 --> 00:56:23.420
It's time to think beyond high school debates and newspapers.

00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:32.659
Rebecca, don't do this to me.

00:56:32.659 --> 00:56:36.659
You're my best friend.

00:56:36.659 --> 00:56:43.150
Why not trust your heart?

00:56:43.150 --> 00:56:48.150
I believe with my whole heart that this is the right thing to do.

00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:57.300
If I start a relationship, it has to be with someone who's willing to live by the same standards that I do.

00:56:57.300 --> 00:57:01.300
I can't accept anything less.

00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:05.300
Um, not comfortable with your standards anymore.

00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:25.449
Berly, did you get called into work?

00:57:25.449 --> 00:57:28.449
You know, I think this can work. I really do.

00:57:28.449 --> 00:57:29.449
Look.

00:57:29.449 --> 00:57:33.679
You're my looking aunt.

00:57:33.679 --> 00:57:34.679
A budget?

00:57:34.679 --> 00:57:36.679
Oh, I need coffee.

00:57:36.679 --> 00:57:40.929
Maybe you don't have to work so much, if at all.

00:57:40.929 --> 00:57:41.929
Really?

00:57:41.929 --> 00:57:43.929
Look, here's my monthly income.

00:57:43.929 --> 00:57:45.929
This column is our regular expenses.

00:57:45.929 --> 00:57:47.929
This one is savings and donations.

00:57:47.929 --> 00:57:49.929
This last one is miscellaneous expenses.

00:57:49.929 --> 00:57:51.929
You run the columns and see.

00:57:51.929 --> 00:57:53.929
I make more than enough money.

00:57:53.929 --> 00:57:55.929
Anything else?

00:57:55.929 --> 00:57:58.929
What about clothes?

00:57:58.929 --> 00:57:59.929
Okay.

00:57:59.929 --> 00:58:05.230
And clothing, so to be a little tight.

00:58:05.230 --> 00:58:07.230
Anything else?

00:58:07.230 --> 00:58:10.230
You know, I'm kind of surprised at it, but no.

00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:11.230
I guess not.

00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:12.230
So what do you think?

00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:14.230
Can we do this?

00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:16.230
Is it realistic?

00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:22.760
Not long ago, I would have said no.

00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:24.760
But I guess the question is,

00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:28.760
will we really trust Jehovah by putting spiritual things first?

00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:33.039
It's kind of scary, though.

00:58:33.039 --> 00:58:35.039
Is it worth losing our kids over?

00:58:35.039 --> 00:58:43.710
But what if we don't even have enough money for a cup of coffee?

00:58:43.710 --> 00:58:45.710
Somehow we'll always have money for coffee.

00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:46.710
Promise?

00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:51.710
I will sell something if I have to to buy you a coffee.

00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:54.710
But why not make a list of some things that we could do without?

00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:56.710
Hmm.

00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:58.710
You know, it's kind of exciting.

00:58:58.710 --> 00:59:01.710
It's like we're starting all over again.

00:59:01.710 --> 00:59:06.019
We're following Jesus' advice.

00:59:06.019 --> 00:59:09.019
So if we're both cutting back on work,

00:59:09.019 --> 00:59:12.019
what will we do with the extra time?

00:59:12.019 --> 00:59:14.019
Keep the ball rolling with the kids.

00:59:14.019 --> 00:59:17.019
And if you're running low on fulfillment,

00:59:17.019 --> 00:59:19.019
about we amp up our field service time.

00:59:19.019 --> 00:59:22.619
So when are you supposed to talk to Mr. O'Connor?

00:59:23.619 --> 00:59:25.619
Today, after work.

00:59:25.619 --> 00:59:27.619
You know what you're going to say?

00:59:27.619 --> 00:59:28.619
Yeah, pretty much.

00:59:28.619 --> 00:59:31.619
I'm thinking I'm praying about it.

00:59:31.619 --> 00:59:32.619
Are you scared?

00:59:32.619 --> 00:59:33.619
Nah.

00:59:33.619 --> 00:59:35.619
Tell the truth.

00:59:35.619 --> 00:59:42.019
Actually, I'm about as nervous as I was when I first met your father.

00:59:42.019 --> 00:59:45.019
Remember when he looked at you for the first time and he said,

00:59:45.019 --> 00:59:47.019
I hope you know how to milk a goat.

00:59:47.019 --> 00:59:49.019
What'd you say to that?

00:59:49.019 --> 00:59:51.019
But I don't understand any of this, Thomas.

00:59:51.019 --> 00:59:54.019
I just need to cut out so much overtime.

00:59:55.019 --> 00:59:58.019
I have more work for you and possibly a raise.

00:59:58.019 --> 01:00:01.019
I don't want more work, Mr. O'Connor.

01:00:01.019 --> 01:00:03.019
And I've got all the money I need.

01:00:03.019 --> 01:00:14.219
Nobody's got all the money they need, Thomas.

01:00:14.219 --> 01:00:20.219
I teach my kids that money is not the most important thing in life.

01:00:20.219 --> 01:00:24.219
I have to show them that I believe it myself.

01:00:24.219 --> 01:00:32.940
You're one of my best employees,

01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:38.050
but you're jeopardizing your place here.

01:00:39.050 --> 01:00:43.050
It's just that there are other very important areas of life

01:00:43.050 --> 01:00:45.050
that deserve more attention than they've been getting.

01:00:45.050 --> 01:00:49.639
Look, Thomas.

01:00:49.639 --> 01:00:51.639
Everybody here likes you.

01:00:51.639 --> 01:00:54.639
I'm happy with your work.

01:00:54.639 --> 01:00:56.639
But this is a game changer.

01:00:56.639 --> 01:01:00.639
All I want is to reduce my hours.

01:01:00.639 --> 01:01:03.639
If it means less pay, I'm willing to accept that.

01:01:03.639 --> 01:01:04.639
Okay.

01:01:04.639 --> 01:01:05.639
Reduce your hours to what?

01:01:05.639 --> 01:01:06.639
What are we talking here?

01:01:06.639 --> 01:01:08.639
No more regular overtime.

01:01:08.639 --> 01:01:10.639
Especially on Wednesdays and Thursdays.

01:01:10.639 --> 01:01:13.639
You're asking me to make a concession just for you, you know?

01:01:13.639 --> 01:01:18.780
You said I was one of your best employees.

01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:26.599
Lily.

01:01:26.599 --> 01:01:27.599
Yes, Mr. O'Connor?

01:01:27.599 --> 01:01:32.599
Line up some interviews right away for the post of mechanical engineer.

01:01:32.599 --> 01:01:40.639
Yes.

01:01:40.639 --> 01:01:42.639
Just tell me one thing.

01:01:42.639 --> 01:01:49.940
Why are you doing this for my family?

01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:51.940
Are you trying to save your marriage?

01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:54.940
I'm trying to save my whole family.

01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:56.940
They need me.

01:01:56.940 --> 01:02:25.559
And I need them.

01:02:25.559 --> 01:02:27.559
I wish I had done years ago what you're doing.

01:02:27.559 --> 01:02:42.300
Maybe I'd still have a family.

01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:47.300
Lily, make those interviews for a second-shift mechanic.

01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:58.679
Thank you.

01:02:58.679 --> 01:03:02.269
Sir.

01:03:02.269 --> 01:03:03.269
See you Monday.

01:03:03.269 --> 01:03:07.260
So Max, what's this plan?

01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:09.659
Make some traffic.

01:03:09.659 --> 01:03:10.659
Marcus, you need to speed up.

01:03:10.659 --> 01:03:11.659
All right, thanks.

01:03:11.659 --> 01:03:12.659
Hey.

01:03:12.659 --> 01:03:15.659
Buster's gonna get nasty.

01:03:15.659 --> 01:03:17.659
So make sure there's plenty of the headroom.

01:03:17.659 --> 01:03:19.659
But you still may have to...

01:03:19.659 --> 01:03:21.659
I have to get nasty.

01:03:21.659 --> 01:03:23.659
Poppy.

01:03:23.659 --> 01:03:25.659
It's about getting attention.

01:03:25.659 --> 01:03:27.659
And if there's the right kind of attention?

01:03:27.659 --> 01:03:29.659
What do you care?

01:03:29.659 --> 01:03:33.039
I believe in you, son.

01:03:33.039 --> 01:03:36.039
I believe that you want to do what's right.

01:03:36.039 --> 01:03:38.039
Here's Buster's revision of the lyrics.

01:03:38.039 --> 01:03:46.000
Oh, man, this is gonna be blazing.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:51.429
Then why lend your talents to what you know is wrong?

01:03:51.429 --> 01:03:54.610
The Otoni.

01:03:54.610 --> 01:03:57.610
This isn't really what I had in mind when I was writing these.

01:03:57.610 --> 01:03:58.610
Hey.

01:03:58.610 --> 01:04:00.610
You got this or not?

01:04:00.610 --> 01:04:03.610
There's a thousand other guys outside,

01:04:03.610 --> 01:04:05.610
dying to be in here.

01:04:05.610 --> 01:04:14.719
So you either with it or you're not.

01:04:14.719 --> 01:04:16.719
You know Marcus, there's nothing better

01:04:16.719 --> 01:04:18.719
than letting Jehovah direct you.

01:04:18.719 --> 01:04:20.719
You'll go places in life.

01:04:20.719 --> 01:04:22.719
No way.

01:04:22.719 --> 01:04:24.719
This is taking me absolutely nowhere.

01:04:24.719 --> 01:04:27.539
Forget him.

01:04:27.539 --> 01:04:29.539
We got his beats.

01:04:29.539 --> 01:04:33.500
I think we could do that this weekend.

01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:35.500
Maybe use the basement.

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:37.500
So what are we gonna do with the basement?

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:41.800
Now that it's empty.

01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:43.800
Now brother and sister Barrow are doing.

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:45.800
I miss them.

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:47.800
So do I.

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:49.800
I hope things are going well for them

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:51.800
and they're new assignment.

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:52.800
Oh, we should call them.

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:53.800
A great idea.

01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:56.800
Have it after the study.

01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:58.800
Okay, show time.

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:00.800
Becca, got your questions lined up?

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:01.800
Yeah.

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:02.800
Right, Nico, got the camera.

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:03.800
Yeah.

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:04.800
Mom, it's the Bible.

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:37.869
Believe what's outside.

01:05:37.869 --> 01:05:38.869
Welcome, son.

01:05:38.869 --> 01:05:39.869
What's up?

01:05:39.869 --> 01:05:43.949
I've been thinking about things.

01:05:43.949 --> 01:05:51.340
And I'd like to be here.

01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:53.340
You must be starved.

01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:55.340
I'll fix you a plate.

01:05:55.340 --> 01:05:57.340
Any eat during family worship?

01:05:57.340 --> 01:05:58.340
Just this one.

01:05:58.340 --> 01:05:59.340
Of course.

01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:00.340
Okay.

01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:02.340
Marcus, you're just in time.

01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:05.340
About to do an investigative report on David and Goliath.

01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:08.340
Becca's gonna do the interview with King David.

01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:13.340
Mom's an eyewitness and I am cameraman.

01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:17.699
What we really need is some music.

01:06:20.239 --> 01:06:21.239
Got any ideas?

01:06:21.239 --> 01:06:24.550
Forget it, prayer.

01:06:24.550 --> 01:06:28.059
Right.

01:06:28.059 --> 01:06:31.059
Anything I should include on behalf of the family?

01:06:31.059 --> 01:06:43.340
Can you thank Jehovah that we're all together?

01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:54.300
Let's thank Jehovah that we're all here to worship him together as a family.

01:06:54.300 --> 01:07:01.949
Reuniting the family in worship didn't happen overnight.

01:07:01.949 --> 01:07:11.239
The turning point was when Deuteronomy 6.6 fully dawned on me

01:07:11.239 --> 01:07:18.409
Before we can impress God's Word on the hearts of our children,

01:07:18.409 --> 01:07:21.409
it must first be on our own heart.

01:07:21.409 --> 01:07:32.519
My being prepared in advance for family worship made it more meaningful.

01:07:32.519 --> 01:07:36.519
And consistency is a must.

01:07:36.519 --> 01:07:44.929
When spiritual priorities became our focus,

01:07:44.929 --> 01:07:51.170
the tide began to turn in the spirit of the family.

01:07:51.170 --> 01:08:08.030
I'm the first to admit it takes real effort.

01:08:08.030 --> 01:08:13.030
But the results are worth it.
