This is the show everyone at work has been talking about.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:08.760
It's supposed to be great, but it looks really spiritistic.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:17.480
Vampires, werewolves, witches are all associated with the spur world, so if our entertainment

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:24.760
involves any of these, we might meditate on Psalms 9710 and ask ourselves, do I really

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.760
hate what you're overhate?

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:36.239
Hmm, it doesn't look that bad, but I know Jehovah hate spiritism, and I want to hate

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:42.799
what you're overhate, that verse also says Jehovah will guard his loyal ones.

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.599
I want to show him that I'm one of his loyal ones.
