00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.750
To let a home in the kitchen Curtis

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:08.310
How's your day always a long day?

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:13.029
That's nice to be at home. That smells amazing. I can't wait. Well, it'll be ready in a few minutes

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:18.190
But I have a surprise so my job give us tickets to the game this weekend

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:25.350
Enough for all of us to go so it's downtown. That sounded like fun. It was a sport. We could enjoy watching

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.230
Collette and I hadn't been in years and I don't think the kids had ever gone

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:43.079
We were all looking forward to a family night out, but dad

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.600
What exactly do we do during the National Anthem?

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.780
Honestly, I wasn't sure

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.939
Ladies and gentlemen, would you please stand for the singing of our National Anthem?

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.849
Dad, I have a question too. Will they still fight at my new school?

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:11.090
That's right

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.609
The conference with her teachers was next week and we didn't know what they do there

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.170
Okay class, not everyone's here. That's all stand for the Pledge of Allegiance

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.030
Elizabeth everything all right

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.269
Well

00:01:33.269 --> 00:01:35.269
Tomorrow nights are family worship evening

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.549
So why don't we do a study project as a family on Christian neutrality at public events

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.790
That sounds like a good idea. Yeah, I think this will be great. We'll all get a chance into our research

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:52.120
I asked Daniel to research Christian principles on neutrality

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:03.510
Collette and Elizabeth would find examples of ones who prove loyal under pressure and for me

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.430
My job was to call Elizabeth's new school to find out if they saluted the flag or sang the anthem

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.060
Hello, hi, Mr. Johnson. Let's just Curtis Elizabeth dad

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:22.669
We'd studied this topic when the kids were younger, but we needed reminders for these new challenges

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:26.229
The kids found some great information

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.349
Several Bible principles applied

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.590
But what Jesus said at Matthew 410 was an essential foundation

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:43.590
It is Jehovah your God you must worship and it is to him alone. You must render sacred service

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.509
If we participate in a nationalistic ceremony

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:53.030
We're sharing in worship of something or someone other than Jehovah God

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.669
But what would help us know what to do?

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:05.469
Elizabeth found some good examples to imitate the account of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego was one of our favorites

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:13.310
When King Nebuchadnezzar ordered them to worship the gold image they bravely stood while others bowed down

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:20.830
They were determined to worship only Jehovah and he rescued them from the furnace and

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:25.349
There are modern-day examples of courage like the three Hebrews

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:36.469
Some children have had to take a stand when governments tried to force them to take part in patriotic events during wartime when feelings of national pride ran strong

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:43.189
And despite legal victories in some countries young ones today are still put to the test

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:47.590
We learned there was no one answer on what to do

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.909
Situations are different depending on where we live or what a person does to show he's participating

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:02.270
But in every case Christians in some way make it evident that they are respectful observers

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.909
Not participants

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.789
We felt good because we had decided what we would do to be respectful but neutral and

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.990
Showed Jehovah that our family worships him alone
