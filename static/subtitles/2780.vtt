00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:12.939
Jehovah's Witnesses are convinced that this system of things is deep into its last days.

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:19.179
And the governing body is intent on reaching as many people as possible with the knowledge

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:20.179
of God.

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:28.100
We want to continue to oversee and give impetus to the preaching work, because this has to

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.260
be done before the end comes.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.940
Mark 1310.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.460
In all the nations, the good news has to be preached first.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.179
Jesus said that we can have more confidence in the fulfillment of the Bible and the sun coming

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:42.179
up.

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:44.619
And so that kind of faith we can do the work, it's involved.

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:46.340
We just pour ourselves into that.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.579
It would be impossible for humans to do what Jehovah accomplished.

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.380
We have to get in full credit for the things that have transpired.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.299
And we also realize that we've got to work to complete.

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:05.980
So keeping our brothers and sisters focused on what Jehovah wants us to do at this particular

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.859
time, seeing how close the end is, that is our main focus and giving full support to

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:17.099
the brotherhood as they continue to show their love for Jehovah, to preach that good news

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:18.379
and all the inhabit of the earth.
