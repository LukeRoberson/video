00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.099
Imagine living in a world without any Bible.

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:12.099
No knowledge of Jehovah or Jesus Christ.

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:14.099
No Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:21.100
No understanding of why we're here or where we're going.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.100
How would you feel?

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.100
It's just like the Apostle Paul told the Ephesians when he said,

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:34.100
you had no hope and you were without God in the world.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.100
One Bethelite told me that when he reads these words,

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.100
it sends a chill through him.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.100
It makes him feel stone cold.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.100
Well, we can be thankful that we don't live in a world

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.100
that Jehovah is unknown.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.100
We don't live in that world, but billions of people do.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.100
I'd like to invite you to turn your Bible's place to Isaiah chapter 60.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.099
And what we're going to see is that the Bible does foretell a time

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:12.099
when the world would be in darkness.

00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:16.099
Isaiah 60, and we're going to start with verse 1.

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:25.469
Arise, O woman, shed light for your light has come.

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:28.469
The glory of Jehovah shines on you.

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:36.469
For look, darkness will cover the earth and thick gloom the nations.

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:39.469
But on you, Jehovah will shine.

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:43.469
And on you, his glory will be seen.

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:50.469
Nations will go to your light and kings to your shining splendor.

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:56.469
So how did the world come to be filled with so much darkness?

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:00.469
We know that from the beginning Satan tried to snuff out worship of Jehovah.

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:03.469
And he probably figured that if the world was going to be dark,

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:10.469
he could keep it that way by destroying either Jehovah's people

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:15.469
or Jehovah's word or preferably both.

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:18.469
But Jehovah has shown that he's in full control of matters.

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:24.469
It says here in these verses that he would raise up his woman.

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:28.469
And that nations would go to this light.

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:36.469
And when we think of nations, we think of various countries, cultures, customs, and languages.

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:43.469
And it only stands to reason that in order for these nations to be attracted to this light,

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:50.469
to understand the message, it would need to be made available to them in their language.

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:54.469
Now, Jehovah has shown that it's easy for him to do this.

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:58.469
He can bring the message to people in their own language.

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:00.469
And we're going to look at an example.

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:02.469
This is in Acts chapter 2.

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:13.319
And we're going to look at the account here of some of the things that took place at Pentecost.

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:19.770
Acts chapter 2.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.770
And we're going to start reading with verse 3.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:30.770
And tongues as if a fire became visible to them and were distributed.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.770
And one of them came to rest on each one of them.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.770
And they all became filled with Holy Spirit and started to speak in different languages,

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.770
just as the Spirit enabled them to speak.

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:50.770
At that time, devout Jews from every nation under heaven were staying in Jerusalem.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:56.770
So when this sound occurred, a crowd gathered and was bewildered.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.770
Because each one heard them speaking in his own language.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.770
Indeed, they were utterly amazed and said, see here.

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.770
All of these who are speaking are Galileans, are they not?

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:14.770
How is it then that each one of us is hearing his own native language?

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:22.769
And then down to verse 11, we hear them speaking in our languages about the magnificent things of God.

00:04:22.769 --> 00:04:31.769
Yes, they were all astonished and perplexed, saying to one another, what does this mean?

00:04:31.769 --> 00:04:36.769
Well, we know that what happened here is in contrast to what Jehovah did at the Tower of Babel.

00:04:36.769 --> 00:04:40.769
Because there people were banding together in rebellion against him.

00:04:40.769 --> 00:04:43.769
And he did something about it to stop that rebellion.

00:04:43.769 --> 00:04:50.769
He erased the knowledge of the language that they knew before and gave them a new language.

00:04:50.769 --> 00:04:56.769
But here in this case, in Pentecost, it seems that Jehovah did not erase the language that they knew before.

00:04:56.769 --> 00:05:00.139
He just gave them a new one.

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:02.139
But what was Jehovah's purpose here?

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:11.139
Why did Jehovah choose this miracle when he had gathered all of these devout Jews together in Jerusalem?

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:19.139
You see, these devout Jews, probably New Greek, attended the synagogue, they knew the lessons of the Messiah.

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:30.139
But these scriptures tell us they were bewildered, utterly amazed, astonished, perplexed at what they were hearing.

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:37.139
This word, astonished in verse 12, is the same Greek word that's used in Luke the 8th chapter,

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:41.139
when Jeres' 12-year-old daughter was resurrected.

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:48.139
And verse 56 tells us that her parents were beside themselves.

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.139
It's a very strong word.

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:54.139
But why did these people have such a strong reaction?

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:57.139
Let's look back at verse 8.

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:04.139
How is it that each one of us is hearing his own native language?

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:07.139
And we're going to take a look at the footnote, and it says,

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:11.139
or the language of his birth.

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:15.139
So you see, this wasn't the language of education for them.

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:19.139
This was the language of the womb.

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:23.139
This is the language that their moms spoke to them in.

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:28.139
And we know that scientists tell us that language development starts in the womb

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:35.139
and that newborns, just a couple of days old, are already crying in the rhythm of the language

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:39.139
that they've been hearing for the last three months in their mother's womb.

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:44.139
So it's interesting that Jehovah chose the language that they started learning in the womb.

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:48.139
This made a very deep impact on them.

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:50.139
You see, Jehovah did this.

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:58.139
He wanted to make this deep emotional impact so that they would go back home to every nation under heaven

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:05.139
and never, ever in their lifetime forget what they saw and heard there at Pentecost.

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:10.139
And they would spread the good news about this to all of the people where they went.

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:15.139
What we learned from this is that Jehovah has power over language.

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:19.139
He used it before and he would use it again.

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:27.139
Now we said before that one of Satan's goals would be to try to destroy Jehovah's people.

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:33.139
So we're going to take a look at some events that show examples of this.

00:07:33.139 --> 00:07:40.139
I'd like to invite you, please, to turn to the back of your Bibles to Appendix B9.

00:07:40.139 --> 00:07:53.810
And you'll see some maps there and please look at the upper right hand corner of the page.

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:59.810
And you're going to see that gray shaded area is the vast, meadow Persian Empire.

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:08.879
Now while you're looking at that map, I want to just read the first two verses of Esther.

00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:19.879
Now in the days of Haseerus, that is the Haseerus who ruled over 127 provinces from India to Ethiopia.

00:08:19.879 --> 00:08:23.879
So you see that there on your map in the lower right hand corner of that gray shaded area.

00:08:23.879 --> 00:08:29.879
You see that meadow Persian Empire goes all the way down toward India into India.

00:08:29.879 --> 00:08:35.879
And in the lower left, the southwest corner all the way down into Ethiopia.

00:08:35.879 --> 00:08:42.879
In those days when King Haseerus was sitting on his royal throne in Shushan, the citadel.

00:08:42.879 --> 00:08:45.879
And you see that, right? Just about in the middle of the map.

00:08:45.879 --> 00:08:49.879
So this creates the setting for these verses that we're going to read.

00:08:49.879 --> 00:08:55.879
I'd like to invite you to turn your Bibles now to Esther, the third chapter.

00:08:55.879 --> 00:08:59.879
And we're going to start reading at verse six.

00:08:59.879 --> 00:09:04.879
We know the story of Esther. Mordecai refused to bow down to Haman.

00:09:04.879 --> 00:09:08.879
And Haman was furious.

00:09:08.879 --> 00:09:10.879
So let's start reading in verse six.

00:09:10.879 --> 00:09:17.879
But he, Haman, despised the thought of doing away with Mordecai alone

00:09:17.879 --> 00:09:21.879
for they had told him about Mordecai's people.

00:09:21.879 --> 00:09:26.879
So Haman began seeking to annihilate all the Jews

00:09:26.879 --> 00:09:32.879
who were in the entire realm of Haseerus, all of Mordecai's people.

00:09:32.879 --> 00:09:37.879
And then verse eight, Haman then said to King Haseerus,

00:09:37.879 --> 00:09:41.879
there is a certain people scattered and dispersed among the peoples

00:09:41.879 --> 00:09:46.879
in all the provinces of your realm, whose laws are different from those of other peoples.

00:09:46.879 --> 00:09:52.879
And they do not obey the King's laws, and it is not in the King's interest to let them be.

00:09:52.879 --> 00:09:57.879
If it pleases the King, let it decree be written that they be destroyed.

00:09:57.879 --> 00:10:03.879
I will pay 10,000 silver talents to the officials to put into the royal treasury.

00:10:03.879 --> 00:10:12.950
We can see that his lies and deception misled the King.

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:15.950
Because he said, a certain people, he didn't say who.

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:19.950
They do not obey the King's laws. This was a lie.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:22.950
And then he said, they should be destroyed.

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:28.950
While in verse 11, King Haseerus said, do with them as you see fit.

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.950
Let's continue our reading in verse 12.

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:37.950
The King's secretaries were then called on the 13th day of the first month.

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:41.950
They put in writing all of Haman's orders to the King's safe traps,

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:46.950
the governors who were over the provinces, and the princes of the different peoples,

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:54.950
to each province in its own script, and to each people in its own language.

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:56.950
They wanted to get the word out.

00:10:56.950 --> 00:11:02.950
It was written in the name of King Haseerus and sealed with the King's signate ring.

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:06.950
The letters were sent by means of couriers to all the King's provinces,

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:14.950
giving the order to annihilate, to kill, and to destroy all the Jews.

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:18.950
Young and old alike, children and women on a single day,

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:22.950
on the 13th day of the 12th month, that is, the month of Adar,

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:25.950
and to seize their possessions.

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:30.950
So you see, this message, kill the Jews, went viral,

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:35.950
and it meant death for all of Jehovah's servants.

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:38.950
Their goal was complete annihilation.

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:42.950
Now, we've learned that Haman was a descendant of Agag.

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:46.950
And he was likely seeking revenge, because Jehovah had decreed

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:52.950
the eventual extermination of the Malakites, and Agag was one of them.

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:57.950
Now, what we read here in the book of Esther reminds us of what we read in the book,

00:11:57.950 --> 00:11:59.950
God's Kingdom Rules.

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:05.950
And there's a nice account on page 93 from our brother, Zikarie Allegbe,

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:11.950
and he talks about the ban against Jehovah's Witnesses in Benin.

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:19.950
And this is what he says, in 1976, when we had 2,300 publishers,

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:24.950
our work was banned, and the government ordered the ban to be broadcast

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:28.950
in every local language.

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:30.950
That was unheard of.

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:34.950
Though Benin's population speaks more than 60 languages,

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:40.950
radio programs back then were usually broadcast in only five.

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:47.950
So you see, in both cases here, they feared the spread of Jehovah's people.

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:53.950
And to ensure success, they felt like they had to get the message out to everyone in their language.

00:12:53.950 --> 00:13:00.950
But did it work? Notice what our brother continues to relate.

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:06.950
When the ban was broadcast in all local languages,

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:12.950
many thousands of people living in remote areas heard of us for the very first time.

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:17.950
They wondered, who are Jehovah's Witnesses? And why are they banned?

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:23.950
Later, when we reached those areas, many accepted the truth in short order.

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:29.950
Today, there are more than 11,500 witnesses in Benin.

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:33.950
So you see, their plan backfired.

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:36.950
Their intent was to stop God's people,

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:40.950
but it ended up helping our brothers spread the good news.

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:42.950
This is not what they intended.

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:44.950
Now let's go back to the book of Esther.

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:48.950
And we're going to start again in chapter 8.

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:58.200
We know that Esther risked her life to approach the king.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:01.200
She exposed Haman's plot to kill the Jews.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.200
Haman was killed. He was hanged on a stake.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:10.200
But since the king's revoke could not, sorry, his decree,

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:14.200
could not be revoked, he allowed a new command to be written

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.200
that would cancel out the documents that Haman sent,

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.200
the first ones that went out.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:23.200
What did these new documents say?

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:28.200
Let's start reading in Esther 8 and verse 11.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:32.200
In these documents, the king granted permission to the Jews

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.200
in all the different cities together together

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:40.200
and defend their lives to annihilate, kill,

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.200
and destroy any forces of any people or province

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:48.200
that might attack them, including women and children

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:51.200
and to seize their possessions.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.200
And the scriptures tell us that the Jews defeated all of those

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:58.200
who hated them, not a man could stand against them.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:02.200
They also killed the ten sons of Haman

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:07.200
and 75,000 others who hated them.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:12.200
But notice who this second order was sent to.

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.200
Let's go to verse 9.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.200
So the secretaries of the king were summoned

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.200
at that time in the third month,

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:23.200
that is, the month of Sivan on the 23rd day,

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:27.200
and they wrote all that Mordecai commanded to the Jews

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.200
as well as to the seetraps, the governors,

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:35.200
and the princes of the provinces from India to Ethiopia,

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:42.200
127 provinces to each province in its own script.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:48.200
Or as the footnotes says, in their own style of writing

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:51.740
and to each people in its own language

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:56.740
and to the Jews in their own script and language.

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:59.740
And what do we think of when we think of this word script?

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:04.980
You see the picture here.

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:07.980
We have symbols and characters that are recognizable to us,

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.980
our alphabet in English,

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:11.980
and it's basically the same in Spanish, French,

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:14.980
and Western European languages.

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:16.980
Some have accents and dots extra,

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:20.980
but basically all of these are considered the Roman script.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:24.980
And then, of course, there are others such as Cyrillic

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.980
that's used by Russia and the former Soviet republics,

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:32.980
Korean, Chinese, their main language families, Arabic.

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:35.980
So it appears that this decree in the Book of Esther

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:38.980
was translated into scores of languages

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:41.980
and many different scripts,

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:45.980
because they recognized that for everyone to comprehend the message

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:47.980
and to act on it,

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:50.980
it had to be made available to them in their language.

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:54.980
You see, it meant life for the Jews

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:56.980
and the survival of the whole Jewish race.

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:59.980
Just think about what the result would have been

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:04.980
had this satanic plot been successful.

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:06.980
We know that the events in the Book of Esther

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:11.980
concluded by about the year 475 BCE.

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:14.980
So just imagine that at that point

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.980
all of Jehovah's servants were killed.

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:22.980
That means after that, no Jewish race,

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:27.980
no walls of Jerusalem rebuilt in 455 BCE,

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:32.980
no book of Malachi written, no Greek scriptures recorded,

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:42.839
no seed of Abraham, no Messiah, where would we be?

00:17:42.839 --> 00:17:47.839
This second message of life that went out

00:17:47.839 --> 00:17:52.839
had to supersede that first message of death that went out.

00:17:52.839 --> 00:17:54.839
It couldn't get to one person less.

00:17:54.839 --> 00:17:58.839
Just imagine if you were one of the condemned ones

00:17:58.839 --> 00:18:02.839
and you were living in the mountains of Tajikistan,

00:18:02.839 --> 00:18:05.839
how important would it be to you

00:18:05.839 --> 00:18:12.839
that everyone in your town actually understood the message?

00:18:12.839 --> 00:18:14.839
What we want to get from this

00:18:14.839 --> 00:18:17.839
is that when it comes to saving people's lives

00:18:17.839 --> 00:18:20.839
and to ensure that they're going to act on the message,

00:18:20.839 --> 00:18:24.839
it needs to come to them in their own language and script.

00:18:24.839 --> 00:18:27.839
And as we saw from what we read in Pentecost,

00:18:27.839 --> 00:18:32.839
Jehovah is perfectly capable of delivering that.

00:18:32.839 --> 00:18:37.839
Now, when it comes to this message of life,

00:18:37.839 --> 00:18:43.839
Satan will do anything he can to block it, to destroy it.

00:18:43.839 --> 00:18:45.839
Let's look at some examples of this.

00:18:45.839 --> 00:18:52.339
Please turn your Bibles to Jeremiah chapter 36.

00:18:52.339 --> 00:18:58.720
And we know that Jehovah told Jeremiah to write in a scroll

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.720
a message of warning to the people

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.720
that Jerusalem was going to be destroyed

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.720
unless they changed their ways.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.720
Now, this message in this scroll was later read

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.720
to King Jehovah Kim.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:14.720
And Jehovah Kim didn't like what he heard.

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.720
So he cut the scroll into pieces

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.720
and he threw them into the fire.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:25.720
Well, was that the end of Jehovah's Word?

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:31.720
Let's start reading in Jeremiah 36 in verse 28,

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.720
where Jehovah told Jeremiah,

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:38.720
take another scroll and write on it all the same words

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.720
that were on the first scroll,

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.720
which King Jehovah Kim of Judah burned up.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.720
And down to verse 32,

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.720
Jeremiah then took another scroll

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.720
and gave it to Barak, the son of Nariah, the secretary,

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.720
and that Jeremiah's dictation he wrote on it,

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:56.720
all the words of the scroll that King Jehovah Kim of Judah

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.720
had burned in the fire.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:04.720
And many more words like those were added.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:11.000
So we see that it turned out exactly as Jehovah foretold,

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
about 17 years later,

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000
Jerusalem was destroyed.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
Many of the rulers were killed,

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
the people were taken as exiles into Babylon.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
But the message that was in that scroll

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
that Jehovah Kim threw into the fire,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
as well as all the circumstances surrounding that event,

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
were recorded here in the book of Jeremiah

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.950
and are preserved till our day.

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:34.950
Now we're going to look at another example,

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:37.950
and I'd like to invite you to turn to the back of your Bible again.

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:41.950
And we're going to look at Appendix A3.

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:47.460
Now, we know that centuries after Jeremiah's time,

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:50.460
Jesus came as the light of the world.

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:58.460
But he did say that an enemy would plant weeds among the wheat.

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:01.460
And that enemy is the devil.

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:04.460
Paul also spoke about the apostasy.

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:06.460
So we're going to read something here.

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:08.460
You're looking at Appendix A3.

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.460
You'll see in the middle of the page

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:15.460
a subheading copious, preserved God's Word,

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:17.460
and then count to the third paragraph,

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:21.460
the one that begins with what about the 27 books?

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:23.460
And then in the middle of the paragraph,

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:27.460
Colossians 416, we're going to start reading right after that.

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:32.460
Despite attempts by Roman Emperor Diocletian

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:36.460
and others to destroy all Christian literature,

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:39.460
thousands of ancient fragments and manuscripts

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:45.460
have been preserved until our day.

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:50.460
Well, who was this Roman Emperor Diocletian?

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:55.460
Well, he's someone who started a vicious persecution

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:59.460
against Christians in the year 303 CE.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:01.460
And it lasted for about eight years.

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:04.460
It was his goal to eradicate Christians.

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:07.460
And one of the first things he did was he decreed

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:10.460
that all the copies of their scriptures be destroyed

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:13.460
because he took it for granted that every Christian community,

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:16.460
wherever they were, had a collection of holy books

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:19.460
that were vital for their survival.

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:23.460
So his men hunted high and low for these books

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:27.460
and they burned them publicly in the marketplaces.

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:31.460
The persecution was intense and barbaric,

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:35.460
and many Christians were maimed and killed.

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:38.460
It was a very difficult time.

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:44.460
So difficult that this time period that ended in 311 CE

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:47.460
is called, even by secular historians,

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:50.460
the great persecution.

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:53.460
Now, it's actually what happened right after this

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:56.460
that catapulted Christianity into darkness.

00:22:56.460 --> 00:23:00.460
You see, in 312, Constantine marched on Rome

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:04.460
and he eventually became the Emperor.

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:08.460
The first thing he did was he officially ended the persecution

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:12.460
and he gave back the property to the Christians.

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:14.460
And he gave them special privileges.

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:18.460
Now you can just imagine this was a sweet victory for Christians.

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:21.460
They welcomed Constantine with open arms.

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:24.460
Constantine surrounded himself with Christians

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:27.460
and he called them brothers.

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:30.460
He wanted to unify all of the people in his realm

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:33.460
under one universal religion.

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:35.460
He even wrote a letter to everyone saying

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:38.460
that they should all become Christians.

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:44.460
And so we know that pagan customs and celebrations

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:50.460
were given Christian names and Christian elders

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:54.460
were given the clothing, the status,

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:59.460
the salary and the prestige of the pagan priests.

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:01.460
Now, not all of the Christians,

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:04.460
but very many of them welcomed Constantine.

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:06.460
They embraced his intervention

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:08.460
and they even praised him and said,

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:14.460
you are an angel sent from God for our protection.

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:17.460
Now, these Christians also embraced the masses

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:20.460
of unconverted pagans who flooded into Christianity.

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:22.460
You see, they called themselves Christian,

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:28.460
but they were not genuine disciples of Jesus Christ.

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:31.460
These Christians considered Constantine a Christian,

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:33.460
but he wasn't one.

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:38.460
He was still officially the high priest of Roman paganism.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:42.460
But he took it upon himself to appoint and remove church leaders.

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:45.460
And in the year 325,

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:48.460
when there was a big dispute about whether God and Jesus

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:53.460
are the same person, they held this council at Nicaea.

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:56.460
And in came the Christians,

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:59.460
some of them named and scarred from all these years

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:02.700
of persecution.

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:07.700
And it was actually Constantine who proposed the wording

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:14.700
and said, God and Jesus are of the same substance.

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:16.700
And when he said that,

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:18.700
many of them were just gasping.

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.700
They said, inspired.

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:24.700
They fell for it.

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:27.700
And this is what laid the foundation

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:30.700
for the Trinity doctrine, which came a few years later.

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:33.700
Now, you see, it wasn't the force of diocletian

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:36.700
and the great persecution that was so effective.

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:38.700
He couldn't conquer the Christians,

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:42.700
but it was the embrace of the world that made them fall.

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:47.700
One writer likened it to a great judo throw.

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.700
He said, you see, in judo,

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.700
you don't have to be bigger and stronger than your opponent.

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.700
You just have to push.

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:57.700
And he pushes back.

00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:01.700
And when he pushes, you pull and you flip him.

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:05.700
And it's his weight and his strength that sends him.

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:08.700
And it's amazing how far he will go.

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:11.700
Well, diocletian pushed on the church.

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:14.700
Constantine did the pull and the throw.

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:17.700
And the church crashed to the ground.

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:18.700
So that a century later,

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:21.700
it wasn't even recognizable as the Christianity that we know.

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:24.700
Because by then, Christians were characterized

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:27.700
by their violence, their bloodshed,

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:30.700
their political intrigue and envy.

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:33.700
The apostasy was truly entrenched.

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:39.700
And this darkness was so great that this control by Rome

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:44.700
and the church came to be known as the Dark Ages.

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:47.700
And so we know what happened after that.

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:51.700
In centuries, the Inquisitions, the Crusades,

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:55.700
these Christians who were persecuted

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:58.700
became the persecutors.

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:02.700
So how bad is it when even the world calls

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:07.700
the influence of the church darkness?

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.700
Remember that Isaiah 60 verse 2 said that darkness

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:13.700
would cover the earth.

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.700
Now, another way to restrict the Bible

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:19.700
would be to limit it to just one or two languages.

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:23.700
And we know that's exactly what this church did for centuries.

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:26.700
They forbid church services in any other language

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:30.700
besides Latin for bid Bible translation.

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:32.700
And if you had a Bible,

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.700
you could be sent to prison for life

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:37.700
or burned at the stake for doing so.

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:40.700
And this routine continued for centuries

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:43.700
because well into the 1900s,

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:46.700
Catholic priests were still confiscating

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:49.700
Bibles and burning them.

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:52.700
But we know that all of these attacks failed.

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:56.700
And the reason why they were just as successful

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:59.700
as King Jehovah came was when he tried to destroy Jehovah's Word

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:04.700
is because the Bible tells us that Isaiah 40 verse 8

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:09.700
the Word of our God endures forever.

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:12.700
And we know that it's only because of Jehovah's intervention.

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.700
Because from the very, very beginning

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:18.700
when the very first scrolls were written,

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:22.700
Jehovah commanded that copies be made.

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:26.700
And professionals skilled scribes and copiasts

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.700
made these copies.

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:31.700
And these early scrolls were translated

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:33.700
into other languages, for example,

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:38.700
in the first century the apostles used the Greek Septuagint Bible.

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:42.700
But we also know that Jehovah protected

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:44.700
the integrity of the message itself.

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:48.700
And we know this because we can look at manuscripts

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:50.700
that are just a few hundred years old

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:54.700
and we can compare them with the oldest known manuscripts,

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:58.700
the Dead Sea Scrolls, some of which are more than 2000 years old.

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:03.700
When we compare them, we see that there's no difference

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:05.700
in meaning between them.

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:11.779
The differences in wording are very, very minor.

00:29:11.779 --> 00:29:15.779
And that gives us confidence that the contents of the Bible

00:29:15.779 --> 00:29:18.779
have not changed from the very beginning.

00:29:18.779 --> 00:29:21.779
What's interesting is that these scrolls,

00:29:21.779 --> 00:29:25.779
the Dead Sea Scrolls, were right there in a cave in plain sight

00:29:25.779 --> 00:29:30.779
in the land of Israel for hundreds and hundreds of years.

00:29:30.779 --> 00:29:32.779
All the way till 1943 they weren't discovered.

00:29:32.779 --> 00:29:35.779
So why were they not discovered during all those years

00:29:35.779 --> 00:29:38.779
down and destroying Jehovah's Word?

00:29:38.779 --> 00:29:42.779
Obviously his protection is evident.

00:29:42.779 --> 00:29:45.779
And it was Jehovah who would ensure that the Bible

00:29:45.779 --> 00:29:48.779
would go on to become the most widely translated,

00:29:48.779 --> 00:29:52.779
most widely distributed document in history

00:29:52.779 --> 00:29:58.779
because parts of the Bible exist in nearly 2700 languages.

00:29:58.779 --> 00:30:01.779
We can see Jehovah has been victorious in this.

00:30:01.779 --> 00:30:06.779
And we know it's the Bible that is the key

00:30:06.779 --> 00:30:09.779
to help people to learn about God,

00:30:09.779 --> 00:30:11.779
to learn to love Him, to serve Him,

00:30:11.779 --> 00:30:16.779
to learn about the blessings of living forever in His Kingdom,

00:30:16.779 --> 00:30:18.779
the Kingdom of Good News.

00:30:18.779 --> 00:30:20.779
And this is what Jesus said,

00:30:20.779 --> 00:30:22.779
would be preached in all the inhabited earth

00:30:22.779 --> 00:30:25.779
for a witness to all the nations

00:30:25.779 --> 00:30:29.779
and then the end would come.

00:30:29.779 --> 00:30:32.779
But the Bible also tells us that as we got closer to the end

00:30:32.779 --> 00:30:35.779
that life would be very, very difficult.

00:30:35.779 --> 00:30:39.779
People would be lovers of themselves, blasphemers,

00:30:39.779 --> 00:30:42.779
disobedient without love of goodness,

00:30:42.779 --> 00:30:46.779
lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God.

00:30:46.779 --> 00:30:52.779
So how would the King be able to raise up an army of preachers

00:30:52.779 --> 00:30:54.779
during these last days

00:30:54.779 --> 00:30:57.779
who would be willing to preach the good news?

00:30:58.779 --> 00:31:00.779
Jehovah tells us what His plan was.

00:31:00.779 --> 00:31:04.779
Let's turn please to Malachi, the third chapter.

00:31:04.779 --> 00:31:13.140
Malachi 3 and verse 1.

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:15.140
This is Jehovah speaking.

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:21.140
Look, I am sending my messenger,

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:23.140
His anointed ones,

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:26.140
and He will clear up away before me.

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:30.140
And suddenly, the true Lord, Jehovah,

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:33.140
whom you are seeking, will come to His temple.

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:36.140
And the messenger of the covenant,

00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:40.140
Jesus Christ, will come in whom you take delight.

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:42.140
Look, He will certainly come,

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:45.140
says Jehovah of armies.

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:47.140
So this is telling us that His messenger

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:51.140
would be on the scene well before Christ's presence,

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:53.140
clearing up the way.

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:56.140
And it's history that tells us, that shows us,

00:31:56.140 --> 00:32:01.140
there was just one small group of faithful ones active at that time

00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:07.140
who stood out as the one and only genuine Christians

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:13.140
who had the privilege of shaking off the legacy that was handed to them,

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:18.140
the layers and layers of false teachings associated with the Bible.

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:21.140
In the beginning, they were so few and things were not clear,

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:24.140
but Jehovah strengthened them.

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:28.140
Organizationally, He cleansed them spiritually,

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:31.140
and He equipped them to preach the good news

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:36.140
and to make genuine disciples.

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:39.140
Now, Jesus made it very clear what their role would be,

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:42.140
as recorded at Matthew 24.45.

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:46.140
Jesus said that He would have a faithful and discreet slave

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:50.140
and appoint him over His domestics to give them their food

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:53.140
at the proper time.

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:59.140
Now, this faithful slave knows that much is at stake,

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:03.140
people's lives, because their commission is the same

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:07.140
as what Jesus told the Apostle Paul, his commission was,

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:10.140
when Jesus appeared to him and blinded him.

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:14.140
As recorded in Acts 26, 18, Jesus told him,

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:19.140
I am sending you to open their eyes,

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:23.140
to turn them from darkness to light,

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:27.140
and from the authority of Satan to God,

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:30.140
so that they may receive forgiveness of sins,

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:35.140
and an inheritance among those sanctified by their faith in me.

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:39.140
So, just like in the days of Esther,

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:44.140
the faithful slave understands that they have a message of life

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:49.140
that must be given to each people in its own language

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:53.140
and in their own script.

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:55.140
Now, was this too difficult for Jehovah to accomplish

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:59.140
with this small group of witnesses?

00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:02.140
How could they possibly do it?

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:06.140
Well, it says, Jesus said, with men, this is impossible,

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:11.139
but with God, all things are possible.

00:34:11.139 --> 00:34:16.139
And so today, what we see is that the good news is being preached

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:20.139
in every nation under heaven,

00:34:20.139 --> 00:34:24.139
and it's being translated into more than 700 languages,

00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:26.139
and in the eyes of the world,

00:34:26.139 --> 00:34:29.139
what is being accomplished by Jehovah's organization

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:32.139
is an impossibility.

00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:37.139
And sometimes, maybe even we feel that it's an impossibility.

00:34:37.139 --> 00:34:41.139
We may be overwhelmed by all that's being produced

00:34:41.139 --> 00:34:44.139
and the results that are being had.

00:34:44.139 --> 00:34:46.139
But what is Jehovah's view on this?

00:34:46.139 --> 00:34:52.139
Let's turn our Bibles, please, to Zechariah 8.

00:34:52.139 --> 00:34:59.030
Zechariah 8.

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:05.309
And we're going to read, starting with verse 6.

00:35:05.309 --> 00:35:09.309
This is what Jehovah of armies says.

00:35:10.309 --> 00:35:13.309
Although it may seem too difficult to the remaining ones

00:35:13.309 --> 00:35:16.309
of this people in those days,

00:35:16.309 --> 00:35:21.309
should it seem too difficult also to me?

00:35:21.309 --> 00:35:24.309
Declares Jehovah of armies?

00:35:24.309 --> 00:35:26.309
This is what Jehovah of army says.

00:35:26.309 --> 00:35:32.309
Here I am saving my people from the lands of the east and the west,

00:35:32.309 --> 00:35:36.309
or as the footnote says, from the land of the sunrise

00:35:36.309 --> 00:35:39.309
and the land of the setting sun.

00:35:39.309 --> 00:35:43.309
And I will bring them in, and they will reside in Jerusalem,

00:35:43.309 --> 00:35:45.309
and they will become my people,

00:35:45.309 --> 00:35:50.309
and I will become their God in truth and in righteousness.

00:35:50.309 --> 00:35:54.309
And so we can say, in this year of 2015,

00:35:54.309 --> 00:35:57.309
without hesitation that the good news is being preached

00:35:57.309 --> 00:36:01.309
around the world from the land of the sunrise

00:36:01.309 --> 00:36:05.309
to the land of the setting sun.

00:36:05.309 --> 00:36:10.309
The faithful and discreet slave have done things Jehovah's way

00:36:10.309 --> 00:36:13.309
and they are reaping his blessings for it.

00:36:13.309 --> 00:36:17.309
And it is us that have the privilege of seeing the fulfillment

00:36:17.309 --> 00:36:19.309
of Jehovah's purposes.

00:36:19.309 --> 00:36:25.309
Now, as an organization, we've been translating for over 130 years,

00:36:25.309 --> 00:36:29.309
and we've always used the resources that are available to us.

00:36:29.309 --> 00:36:32.309
And I would just like to mention one briefly,

00:36:32.309 --> 00:36:38.309
and this is the MEPS system that was developed in the early 1980s.

00:36:38.309 --> 00:36:42.309
And back in those days, it was actually impossible.

00:36:42.309 --> 00:36:46.309
There was not a way to type very many scripts around the world

00:36:46.309 --> 00:36:48.309
into a computer.

00:36:48.309 --> 00:36:51.309
You could just do some basic scripts, like Roman script,

00:36:51.309 --> 00:36:54.309
and a few others.

00:36:54.309 --> 00:36:59.309
But the governing body had the foresight to understand

00:36:59.309 --> 00:37:04.309
that we needed to create a computer system, hardware and software

00:37:04.309 --> 00:37:08.309
that could bring the message of life to each people

00:37:08.309 --> 00:37:12.309
in their own language and in their own style of writing,

00:37:12.309 --> 00:37:15.309
in their own script.

00:37:15.309 --> 00:37:19.309
And it's still this computer program that's being used to this day

00:37:19.309 --> 00:37:23.309
to help publish our literature and to share our information

00:37:23.309 --> 00:37:25.309
on our website.

00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:28.309
Now, it's interesting, it's just the kind of coincidence,

00:37:28.309 --> 00:37:31.309
that all of these languages that you're seeing here

00:37:31.309 --> 00:37:35.309
are ones that are spoken today in that area

00:37:35.309 --> 00:37:38.309
that you saw in that map earlier, the Meadow Persian Empire.

00:37:38.309 --> 00:37:41.309
This is not all of the languages, it's just a few.

00:37:41.309 --> 00:37:47.849
But it shows that Jehovah's Word is reaching into every corner of the earth.

00:37:47.849 --> 00:37:53.849
Now, though the Bible is available in 2700 languages,

00:37:53.849 --> 00:37:57.849
the reality is that many of those languages are dead languages.

00:37:57.849 --> 00:38:00.849
They're spoken by people anymore.

00:38:00.849 --> 00:38:02.849
And the governing body also understands

00:38:02.849 --> 00:38:07.849
that we cannot rely on Bible societies

00:38:07.849 --> 00:38:13.849
and the Bible translations that are distributed by them.

00:38:13.849 --> 00:38:15.849
Because there are several problems.

00:38:15.849 --> 00:38:19.849
Their Bibles are hard to get, they're expensive,

00:38:19.849 --> 00:38:25.849
and they are on a mission to eradicate Jehovah's name.

00:38:25.849 --> 00:38:31.849
And so now we have the New World Translation available in 128 languages.

00:38:31.849 --> 00:38:35.849
It's true, the faithful slave has taken on a tremendous work

00:38:35.849 --> 00:38:37.849
with Bible translation.

00:38:37.849 --> 00:38:42.849
But what is more important than making the Bible available to people?

00:38:42.849 --> 00:38:45.849
You see, it's so easy for us to take it for granted

00:38:45.849 --> 00:38:47.849
that we have a Bible in our language.

00:38:47.849 --> 00:38:51.849
Because most of us here in the audience have been given a Bible

00:38:51.849 --> 00:38:53.849
from the time you were born.

00:38:53.849 --> 00:38:56.849
For many of us, it was the New World Translation.

00:38:56.849 --> 00:38:59.849
But the reality is that for many of our brothers and sisters around the world,

00:38:59.849 --> 00:39:03.849
they went a very long time without having Bibles.

00:39:03.849 --> 00:39:06.849
And if they could get a Bible, often,

00:39:06.849 --> 00:39:09.849
it was something that used archaic language

00:39:09.849 --> 00:39:13.849
where they were just bad translations.

00:39:13.849 --> 00:39:17.849
But they still needed to read the Bible every day.

00:39:17.849 --> 00:39:21.849
And they would see words like hell and cross.

00:39:21.849 --> 00:39:23.849
And they knew these were wrong.

00:39:23.849 --> 00:39:25.849
But then they would read other things and say,

00:39:25.849 --> 00:39:27.849
I wonder if this is also wrong.

00:39:27.849 --> 00:39:29.849
Can I really trust this?

00:39:29.849 --> 00:39:33.849
It's as if they're reading the Bible with their foot on the break,

00:39:33.849 --> 00:39:39.849
not quite sure if this is what the Bible actually says.

00:39:39.849 --> 00:39:42.849
Well, it's as one sister said,

00:39:42.849 --> 00:39:44.849
with the New World Translation,

00:39:44.849 --> 00:39:49.849
I understand it, and I can trust it.

00:39:49.849 --> 00:39:55.849
Now, how many people does it take to get this message of life out

00:39:55.849 --> 00:40:01.849
to each people in their own language and in their own script?

00:40:01.849 --> 00:40:05.380
About 8 million.

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:12.380
You see, we're all part of one large army of Jehovah's servants,

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:14.380
and we need each other.

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:19.380
But this large army is made up of more than 31,000

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:22.380
who are working at Bethel worldwide.

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:28.380
Now, this figure includes more than 6,300 commuters

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:30.380
and temporary volunteers.

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:32.380
But the point is that it's a collective effort

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:35.380
between all of us along with Jehovah's spirit

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:37.380
that makes this work possible.

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:41.380
And it shows that it's his work because there's no individual

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:43.380
who can take credit for it.

00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:47.699
Now, many of you Bethelites are setting a very good example

00:40:47.699 --> 00:40:52.699
when it comes to reaching out to people who speak other languages.

00:40:52.699 --> 00:40:55.699
For example, here in the United States branch territory,

00:40:55.699 --> 00:41:02.699
about 2,400 of you support congregations other than English.

00:41:02.699 --> 00:41:09.699
For example, 161 of you support Chinese congregations.

00:41:09.699 --> 00:41:13.699
And there are 56 of you who are currently enrolled

00:41:13.699 --> 00:41:16.699
in a foreign language class.

00:41:17.699 --> 00:41:20.699
You are doing a wonderful work.

00:41:20.699 --> 00:41:24.699
We know that it's not as easy if you were just born into that language,

00:41:24.699 --> 00:41:26.699
or if you could just pioneer in that language,

00:41:26.699 --> 00:41:29.699
it's hard work to learn a language.

00:41:29.699 --> 00:41:32.699
But not doubt your efforts are encouraging to others,

00:41:32.699 --> 00:41:35.699
and you contribute a lot to the stability of the congregation

00:41:35.699 --> 00:41:39.329
that you're supporting.

00:41:39.329 --> 00:41:43.329
It takes a lot of work, and we encourage you not to just be satisfied

00:41:43.329 --> 00:41:45.329
with learning the basics of a language,

00:41:45.329 --> 00:41:49.329
but make it your aim to keep making progress,

00:41:49.329 --> 00:41:51.329
to get better and better,

00:41:51.329 --> 00:41:54.329
so that you can really be of support to the brothers and sisters.

00:41:54.329 --> 00:41:56.329
It can be done.

00:41:56.329 --> 00:42:00.329
And really, no matter the language of the congregation that you attend,

00:42:00.329 --> 00:42:03.329
we can confidently say to foreigners,

00:42:03.329 --> 00:42:09.329
we have literature in your language.

00:42:09.329 --> 00:42:16.329
Just like Acts 1727 tells us that people should seek God

00:42:16.329 --> 00:42:19.329
that they might grow for him and find him.

00:42:19.329 --> 00:42:22.329
And you can just imagine somebody groping for something.

00:42:22.329 --> 00:42:24.329
They can't see it, maybe it's dark,

00:42:24.329 --> 00:42:27.329
but they understand that it's something within reach,

00:42:27.329 --> 00:42:30.329
and they're just trying to feel for it,

00:42:30.329 --> 00:42:32.329
and just to see if they can get it.

00:42:32.329 --> 00:42:38.329
And the Bible tells us that, yes, people can really find God

00:42:38.329 --> 00:42:40.329
if they grow for him.

00:42:40.329 --> 00:42:46.329
In fact, he is not far off from any one of us.

00:42:46.329 --> 00:42:51.329
And it's amazing that we have so many gifts

00:42:51.329 --> 00:42:54.329
to make this message of life accessible.

00:42:54.329 --> 00:42:59.329
We have a freshly revised Bible translation.

00:42:59.329 --> 00:43:05.329
We have the watchtower in a few simplified languages.

00:43:05.329 --> 00:43:07.329
We have songs that touch our hearts.

00:43:07.329 --> 00:43:13.329
We have Bible education material for babies, for children,

00:43:13.329 --> 00:43:15.329
for teenagers.

00:43:15.329 --> 00:43:19.329
We have audio recordings, videos, publications in Braille,

00:43:19.329 --> 00:43:23.329
in sign language, internet web pages,

00:43:23.329 --> 00:43:29.329
and most of these are available in dozens or hundreds of languages.

00:43:29.329 --> 00:43:33.329
We can see that Jehovah doesn't want to leave anybody out.

00:43:33.329 --> 00:43:37.329
He wants to make this message of life available to everybody,

00:43:37.329 --> 00:43:40.329
no matter what their station and life.

00:43:40.329 --> 00:43:47.329
As an example, this brochure has been translated into over 600 languages,

00:43:47.329 --> 00:43:53.329
and some could say that it's possibly the most widely translated,

00:43:53.329 --> 00:43:58.329
I should say the second most widely translated document in history,

00:43:58.329 --> 00:44:00.329
next to the Bible.

00:44:00.329 --> 00:44:05.329
Now, we are thankful to the governing body

00:44:05.329 --> 00:44:13.329
that all of this spiritual food is made available for free.

00:44:13.329 --> 00:44:18.329
Without charge, we're thankful to them for their courage,

00:44:18.329 --> 00:44:22.329
especially when it comes to Bible translation,

00:44:22.329 --> 00:44:24.329
and restoring Jehovah's name.

00:44:24.329 --> 00:44:28.329
And we thank them for not just being concerned with the numbers

00:44:28.329 --> 00:44:31.329
like some religions are, they just want to go around and baptize people

00:44:31.329 --> 00:44:34.329
so they can count them up and say, we have a lot of members.

00:44:34.329 --> 00:44:39.329
But the anointed are genuinely concerned with the quality of our faith,

00:44:39.329 --> 00:44:45.329
and they, untiringly, keep encouraging us and cheering us on

00:44:45.329 --> 00:44:51.329
to keep our relationship with Jehovah, to not lose our faith.

00:44:51.329 --> 00:44:56.820
This planet is now seeing the greatest preaching work

00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:59.820
that's ever been done in the history of mankind.

00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:03.820
His word has pierced through the darkness,

00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:07.820
and conquered all of these obstacles that Satan has put in the way.

00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:11.820
It says, if it's just like Isaiah 11, 19 says,

00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:15.820
the earth will certainly be filled

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:22.030
with the knowledge of Jehovah as the waters cover the sea.

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:26.030
We have so many good things to look forward to.

00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:29.030
We know that in the Bible, Jehovah showed his power

00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:32.030
in some spectacular ways.

00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:37.030
For example, at Babel, or at Pentecost,

00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:40.030
or in the days of Esther and Mordecai,

00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:45.030
he stopped a genocide in its tracks.

00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:50.030
And Jehovah has brought the light of truth to a dark world.

00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:54.030
He's preserved his word and his people.

00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:57.030
And so we have every reason to believe

00:45:57.030 --> 00:46:00.030
at the end of the system of things.

00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:03.030
The climax is going to be even more spectacular

00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:06.030
than anything Jehovah has ever done before.

00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:10.409
How thankful we can be to Jehovah

00:46:10.409 --> 00:46:14.409
for allowing us the privilege just to see his hand at work

00:46:14.409 --> 00:46:17.409
during these last days.

00:46:17.409 --> 00:46:21.409
And how thankful we are that we do not live in a world

00:46:21.409 --> 00:46:26.550
where Jehovah is unknown.

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:29.550
And how happy we can be that the good news

00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:34.550
is being made known to people, to each people,

00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:38.550
in its own language and in their own script.
