00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:10.609
Bible prophecy is a fascinating subject.

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:15.609
Prophecy is far more than just predictions about the future.

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:18.609
Jehovah knows all the facts.

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:23.609
He can even control and change factors to ensure the outcome he desires.

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.609
At Isaiah 55-11 he says,

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.609
My word that goes out of my mouth will not return to me without results

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:36.609
and it will have sure success.

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:40.609
Jehovah's prophecies have a perfect record of success.

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:43.609
He has led his people in the past.

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:50.609
So when he prophesies that he'll lead his people to real lasting peace in the future,

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:52.609
this is in a prediction.

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:54.609
It's a guarantee.

00:00:54.609 --> 00:01:00.609
The prophecies given to Daniel clearly show that God's kingdom will without a doubt

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:24.819
bring lasting peace for all mankind.

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:29.819
I found a man from the axiles of Judah who could make no interpretation to the king.

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:33.840
I know who he is.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:47.219
Can you really make known to me the dream that I saw at his interpretation?

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:50.219
This is your dream.

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:56.189
Jehovah is the great time keeper.

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:02.189
The prophetic portions of the book of Daniel built faith by showing that Jehovah knows the course of history

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.189
in centuries even millenniums in advance.

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.189
While portions of these prophecies were fulfilled in Daniel's time,

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:14.189
many of the details are being fulfilled right down to our day.

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:20.949
So as we discover the significance of these prophecies, we're excited about what lies ahead.

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:26.949
And our confidence grows as we discern how Jehovah has been leading his people all along.

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:31.710
In the days of those kings,

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.710
the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:51.180
The divine dream that Daniel interprets for King Nebuchadnezzar constitutes a prophecy crucial for the lasting peace of mankind.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:03:00.180
A promise from Jehovah to set up a kingdom that would be vastly superior to earthly kingdoms.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:07.180
History has shown us how every type of human government imaginable has failed.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.180
So how would Jehovah's government come?

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.180
When would it arrive?

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.180
These were questions Daniel himself likely had.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:27.939
Jehovah is a revealer of secrets.

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:32.939
He would eventually answer these questions in due time.

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:42.939
As a diligent student of the Scriptures, the prophet Daniel had full faith and confidence in Jehovah's ability to schedule events and bring them about.

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:45.939
And now likely in his 90s.

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:57.689
Daniel was particularly interested in prophecies regarding the restoration of his beloved city, Jerusalem.

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:00.689
Seven years at Babylon are fulfilled.

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:03.689
I will turn my attention to you.

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:11.939
And I will make good my promise by bringing you back to this place.

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:25.660
Jeremiah's prophecy had given Daniel hope because it indicated that Jews would soon return to their homeland of Judah and rebuild Jerusalem along with its temple.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.660
In a big sense that Daniel would be interested in the restoration of the temple.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:36.660
Because from the time of King Solomon, the temple in Jerusalem was the world center for worship of Jehovah.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.660
So it was very important to the Jews.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.660
In the Scriptures, the temple was often called the House of Jehovah.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:52.660
Now after Jehovah allowed young Daniel on the rest of the Israelites to be taken captive to Babylon.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.660
The city of Jerusalem and the temple were destroyed.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:04.660
So naturally, a God-fearing man like Daniel would be interested in seeing the temple rebuilt.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:12.930
Again, as a man of faith, Daniel supplicates Jehovah.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.930
Oh, Jehovah.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.980
He's due here.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:20.980
I do forgive.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.980
Oh, Jehovah, do be attention and act.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.980
Do not delay for your own sake.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.980
Oh, my God.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:46.689
Oh, Daniel, give you insight and understanding.

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:51.689
The visit of this angel gave Daniel some answers and a hope.

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:57.689
Jehovah's messenger provided so many details of promises to come.

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:02.689
Jehovah assured Daniel that the Jews would be restored to their homeland.

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:06.689
Their exile in Babylonia was almost over.

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:10.689
But that wasn't the end of the angel's message.

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:15.689
He gave Daniel insight into something of far greater significance.

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:20.689
Daniel was told when God's people could expect the arrival of the foretold Messiah.

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:27.689
The Messiah would be the ruler who would make it possible for obedient humans to regain the blessing of perfect life.

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:30.689
Free from sickness, free from death.

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:35.689
The Messiah would pave the way for lasting peace for mankind.

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:42.220
What a strengthening message for Daniel to receive.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.220
And he likely had some questions.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:52.220
The angel told Daniel that Jerusalem and its temple would be rebuilt before the Messiah arrived.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:57.220
But at the time, Jerusalem and the temple were in shambles.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.220
How would they rebuild it?

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.220
And who would be responsible for this?

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:12.379
Babylon had been overtaken by meadow Persia, pictured by the silver chest and arms of Nebuchadnezzar's dream image.

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:19.379
Not long after this change in world rulership, Persian king Cyrus issued a royal decree.

00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:25.379
It was a commission from Cyrus himself for the Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple.

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:37.540
King Cyrus, releasing the Jews, was in notable contrast with the Babylonians' desire to keep them captive.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:42.540
Cyrus even authorized funds from the king's house to cover construction expenses.

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:50.540
Why would this pagan ruler have any interest in first of all, letting the captive Jews free?

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:55.540
And secondly, financing the rebuilding of their temple in Jerusalem.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:00.540
Ezra's words at Second Chronicles 36.22 tell us,

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:05.540
Jehovah stirred the spirit of King Cyrus of Persia.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:11.540
Jehovah can maneuver events to make sure his word is fulfilled.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:15.540
He can use anyone to accomplish his purpose.

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:25.540
And this would include even a foreign king like Cyrus, so with this decree, the Jews returned to Judah.

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:37.149
Launching a construction project and resettling an entire city was a major undertaking.

00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:46.149
High priest Jeshua and governors Rubble were appointed to take the lead in setting up the altar and rebuilding the temple.

00:08:46.149 --> 00:08:49.149
But this wasn't without his challenges.

00:08:49.149 --> 00:08:56.149
Enemies of Judah sought to sabotage the building of the temple, attempting to disrupt the peace.

00:08:56.149 --> 00:09:00.149
Initial attempts to halt the building progress fail.

00:09:00.149 --> 00:09:06.149
However, eventually these enemies succeeded in having an official ban placed on the temple building work.

00:09:06.149 --> 00:09:09.149
What was the problem here?

00:09:09.149 --> 00:09:16.149
It appears the Jews let fear of man stop the building work after about 14 years of constant opposition.

00:09:16.149 --> 00:09:21.899
Now there's a bigger picture of play here.

00:09:21.899 --> 00:09:29.899
Remember Daniel's prophecy foretold that Jerusalem and its temple would be rebuilt before the Messiah arrived.

00:09:29.899 --> 00:09:34.899
Yet with the work halted, the temple remained unfinished.

00:09:34.899 --> 00:09:37.899
What would that mean for the coming of the Messiah?

00:09:37.899 --> 00:09:40.899
Jeshua and Zerobelville needed guidance.

00:09:40.899 --> 00:09:46.899
This is where Jehovah steps in to provide encouragement, first through the Prophet Haggai.

00:09:50.019 --> 00:09:54.019
Haggai's clear and powerful message gets right to the heart of the matter.

00:09:54.019 --> 00:10:01.330
He conveys Jehovah's direction to get up and keep building the temple despite opposition.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:04.330
The Jews had a decision to make here.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.330
Would they allow opposition to hinder the work?

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:12.330
Or would they listen to Jehovah's words through Haggai and keep rebuilding the temple?

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:19.330
To guide them further, Jehovah spoke to the Prophet Zechariah and gave him visions to provide the Jews with a message.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:28.330
Zechariah made it clear to the Jews that Jehovah would not allow their opposers to harm them or thwart the temple rebuilding work.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:32.330
It was only with Jehovah's guidance that the Jews would succeed.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:43.330
Energized by Jehovah's motivating words through these two prophets, they courageously resumed construction of the temple and it was inaugurated in 515 BCE.

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:52.179
Now it seems that at some point over the following decades, the Jews lost their initial zeal.

00:10:52.179 --> 00:11:00.179
The temple was rebuilt and inaugurated, but Jerusalem's walls and gates remained unfinished with huge gaps left in them.

00:11:00.179 --> 00:11:05.179
And that was significant because the city was surrounded by enemy nations.

00:11:05.179 --> 00:11:10.179
Without the protection of these walls, Jerusalem seemed vulnerable.

00:11:10.179 --> 00:11:15.179
When Nehemiah learned of this, he was visibly distressed.

00:11:15.179 --> 00:11:17.179
What's going on, Henei?

00:11:17.179 --> 00:11:20.179
How are people?

00:11:20.179 --> 00:11:22.179
Not good.

00:11:22.179 --> 00:11:26.179
The conditions are disgraceful.

00:11:26.179 --> 00:11:32.179
The walls of Jerusalem are broken down and its gates have been burned with fire.

00:11:32.179 --> 00:11:35.070
What about the temple?

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:39.070
It stands, but the services are nothing but empty rituals.

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:44.070
Most of the people and the priests ignore God's law.

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:49.070
Nehemiah must have been shocked to hear about the condition of Jerusalem.

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:53.070
At this time, he was serving as cup bearer to the Persian king in Shushan.

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:58.070
The journey from Shushan to Jerusalem was about a thousand miles.

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:02.070
Still, Nehemiah felt compelled to act.

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:12.889
Nehemiah rejoiced at the prospect of rebuilding the walls.

00:12:12.889 --> 00:12:20.820
The Jews at this time were still fearful of their opposers.

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.820
But Nehemiah was intent on changing that.

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:29.190
He knew that Jehovah was behind the work.

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:36.190
And if Jehovah is behind something, there's no amount of opposition that can thwart his will.

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:39.190
So the wall repairs began.

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:47.419
This isn't to say that there were not challenges along the way.

00:12:47.419 --> 00:12:50.419
Opposers did not give up.

00:12:51.419 --> 00:12:58.419
I recommend we turn the accusation of sedition against Nehemiah.

00:12:58.419 --> 00:13:00.419
That's brilliant.

00:13:00.419 --> 00:13:02.419
Yes.

00:13:02.419 --> 00:13:04.419
It will beg for our help.

00:13:04.419 --> 00:13:07.419
These opposers threatened the Jews,

00:13:07.419 --> 00:13:12.419
schemed against them, and even accused Nehemiah of treason.

00:13:12.419 --> 00:13:20.980
Nehemiah's peace and the peace of the Jews supporting the work was threatened.

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.980
But despite the attempts of opposers,

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:29.980
Nehemiah and the Jews looked to Jehovah for guidance and kept working.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:35.440
When Jehovah declares his purpose,

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:40.440
there is nothing that can prevent him from carrying it out.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:44.440
So if Jehovah wanted a rebuilt Jerusalem,

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.440
complete with rebuilt walls,

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:54.440
Nehemiah would have complete faith in Jehovah's ability to support the rebuilding efforts.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.440
And with this support,

00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:01.440
the city walls were completed in just 52 days.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:12.919
Nehemiah, the wall is complete.

00:14:12.919 --> 00:14:15.919
With rebuilt walls and a rebuilt temple,

00:14:15.919 --> 00:14:19.919
physically the city was in good condition.

00:14:19.919 --> 00:14:22.919
However, about 12 years later,

00:14:22.919 --> 00:14:25.919
Nehemiah returned to Shushan.

00:14:25.919 --> 00:14:27.919
During his prolonged absence,

00:14:27.919 --> 00:14:30.919
the spiritual state of the Jews deteriorated.

00:14:30.919 --> 00:14:32.919
It was so sad,

00:14:32.919 --> 00:14:36.919
as many in Israel fell back into bad practices.

00:14:36.919 --> 00:14:39.919
Some in the priesthood, including high priest Elishib,

00:14:39.919 --> 00:14:42.919
no longer took their responsibilities seriously.

00:14:42.919 --> 00:14:45.919
Therefore, Jehovah raised up the prophet Malachi

00:14:45.919 --> 00:14:50.200
to counsel the negligent priests.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.200
Why have you, Levites, despised Jehovah's name?

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.200
despised it. You present a blind,

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.200
lame or sick animal as a sacrifice,

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.200
and say that it is nothing bad?

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.200
Should Jehovah accept it from your hand?

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.200
And there's another thing you do,

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.200
so that he no longer looks favorably on anything you offer,

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.200
because you betray the wife of your youth.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:13.200
Although she's your partner, your legal wife,

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:16.200
the lips of a priest should safeguard knowledge,

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.200
and people should seek the law from his mouth.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.200
But you?

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.200
You have made many stumble.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:30.700
Evidently, Malachi's words had little effect on the priesthood.

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:32.700
Despite his warnings,

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.700
the people refused to change.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.700
When Nehemiah returned,

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:39.700
what he found shocked him.

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:41.700
For a long time, the priests

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:44.700
and the Levites have not taken their duties seriously.

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:47.700
When the people saw that, they stopped bringing in tithes.

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.700
Without the tithes,

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.700
most Levites and singers returned to their fields.

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:56.700
Did Elishib not tell the people to bring their provisions?

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.700
In your absence,

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:02.700
the prophet Malachi warned him and all the priests.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:04.700
But Elishib,

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.700
he took our storeroom,

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.700
emptied it of our provisions,

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.700
he gave it to Baya to use as a dining hall.

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:16.080
In addition to no longer providing financial support,

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:20.080
the people started conducting business on the Sabbath.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.460
What are you selling today?

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:27.460
Only the best quality fish from tired.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:29.460
They were marrying foreign women.

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:31.460
I'm marrying Gisla today.

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.460
Gisla.

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:36.460
That mobile girl?

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:40.460
I heard you bind yourself with an oath and a curse not to take away from the nations.

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:45.929
This action could have disrupted the line to the Messiah,

00:16:45.929 --> 00:16:49.929
and it definitely threatened to contaminate pure worship.

00:16:49.929 --> 00:16:55.929
These men were bringing the restored nation into disfavor with Jehovah.

00:16:55.929 --> 00:17:01.929
This is the same reason why Jehovah allowed Babylon to destroy Jerusalem in the first place.

00:17:01.929 --> 00:17:12.210
So Nehemiah took action against these faithless ones.

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:15.210
Please cleanse this room and replace the utensils.

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:16.210
Yes, my Lord.

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:19.210
And gather all the Levites, the singers, the deputy rulers to me.

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:21.210
I'm assigning them all back to their posts.

00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:24.210
He enforced the strict observance of the Sabbath.

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.210
What's the meaning of this?

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:28.210
I had to sleep on the ground last night.

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:30.210
You know God's law?

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:31.210
No work?

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:32.210
No business?

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:34.210
On the Sabbath?

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:35.210
Go!

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:38.210
You and all the Levites guard the gates and keep the Sabbath home.

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:40.210
Don't let anyone in.

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:47.019
He disciplined those who had taken foreign wives.

00:17:47.019 --> 00:17:49.019
Did you not swear?

00:17:49.019 --> 00:17:51.019
Never to marry someone who doesn't serve Jehovah?

00:17:51.019 --> 00:17:54.019
Nehemiah, nobody cares.

00:17:54.019 --> 00:17:56.019
Oh, did you not?

00:17:56.019 --> 00:17:57.019
Yes, yes.

00:17:57.019 --> 00:18:02.019
Why have you ignored the command of Jehovah and your own oath?

00:18:02.019 --> 00:18:08.019
There's no doubt Jehovah's guide Nehemiah's efforts all along.

00:18:08.019 --> 00:18:14.019
After a spiritual cleansing was done, a measure of peace was again enjoyed.

00:18:14.019 --> 00:18:18.019
And with this vigorous rooting out of apostasy,

00:18:18.019 --> 00:18:26.319
the record of the Hebrew scriptures comes to a close.

00:18:26.319 --> 00:18:31.319
Now, we don't have an inspired record of events in the centuries leading up to Jesus' birth.

00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:37.319
But history shows that Jerusalem underwent several changes during these years.

00:18:37.319 --> 00:18:45.319
The Meadow Persian Empire was overtaken by Greece, represented by the copper belly and thighs of Nebuchadnezzus dream image.

00:18:45.319 --> 00:18:50.319
While the city seemed to survive the change in control without any physical damage,

00:18:50.319 --> 00:18:53.319
its spiritual state was threatened.

00:18:53.319 --> 00:19:00.319
The Greek Empire set the stage for the spread of Greek language, culture, and religious thought.

00:19:00.319 --> 00:19:04.319
And Israel was affected by this influence.

00:19:04.319 --> 00:19:11.319
Years later, King Antiochus IV was determined to eradicate Jewish worship and customs.

00:19:11.319 --> 00:19:18.319
He went so far as to sacrifice a peg to the Greek God Zeus at the Temple of Jehovah.

00:19:18.319 --> 00:19:22.319
This was a vicious attempt to defile and stamp out pure worship.

00:19:22.319 --> 00:19:26.319
However, the desecration had the opposite effect.

00:19:26.319 --> 00:19:30.319
It sparked an uprising of zealous Jews, and three years later,

00:19:30.319 --> 00:19:35.319
they cleansed the temple and rededicated it to Jehovah.

00:19:35.319 --> 00:19:40.319
About a century later, Jerusalem experienced another change in rulership,

00:19:40.319 --> 00:19:44.319
as Rome became the dominant world power.

00:19:44.319 --> 00:19:50.660
Rome corresponded to the legs of iron and Nebuchadnezzus dream image.

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:55.660
Under the rule of Herod the Great, Jerusalem enjoyed considerable prosperity.

00:19:55.660 --> 00:20:01.660
Herod's greatest work, however, was the reconstruction of the temple and its building complex.

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:06.660
The temple and its daily sacrifices remained in operation down to Jesus' day.

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:10.660
The Bible record picks up before Jesus was born.

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:31.180
What's happening? Is the Son of God already?

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:34.180
Are they angels?

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:36.180
Do not be afraid.

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:41.180
For look, I am declaring to you good news of a great joy that all the people will have.

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:48.180
For today, there was born to you in David City, a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:52.180
Jesus' birth and ministry fulfilled many prophecies.

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:57.180
In 29 CE, Jehovah anointed Jesus with Holy Spirit.

00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:04.180
This corresponds exactly to the words of Daniel's prophecy that Jehovah gave him more than 500 years earlier.

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:08.180
The promised Messiah had arrived.

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:13.180
Early in his ministry, Jesus read these words from the prophecy of Isaiah.

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:18.869
The scroll of Isaiah the prophet reads,

00:21:18.869 --> 00:21:22.869
Jehovah's Spirit is upon me,

00:21:22.869 --> 00:21:27.869
because he anointed me to declare good news to the poor.

00:21:27.869 --> 00:21:33.869
He sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and a recovery of sight to the blind,

00:21:33.869 --> 00:21:48.130
to send the crushed ones away free, to preach Jehovah's acceptable year.

00:21:48.130 --> 00:22:00.210
Today, this scripture that you just heard is fulfilled.

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:07.210
Holy Spirit empowered Jesus to perform many miracles in just a few short years on earth.

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:11.210
This had a profound effect on the people living in his day.

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:18.779
A very sick woman suffered from a flow of blood for some 12 years.

00:22:18.779 --> 00:22:26.779
He can heal me even if I could touch just the fringes of his outer garment.

00:22:26.779 --> 00:22:39.859
I will get well.

00:22:39.859 --> 00:22:41.859
I will touch my outer garments.

00:22:41.859 --> 00:22:46.799
Who touched me?

00:22:46.799 --> 00:22:48.799
Please forgive me, my Lord.

00:22:48.799 --> 00:22:52.619
It was I who touched you.

00:22:52.619 --> 00:22:54.619
A faith in you.

00:22:54.619 --> 00:23:04.099
I knew that if I could just touch the fringes of your outer garment, I could get well.

00:23:04.099 --> 00:23:06.099
Take courage, daughter.

00:23:06.099 --> 00:23:12.650
Your faith has made you well.

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:17.650
The miracles Jesus performed more like anything that people had seen before.

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:23.650
Finally, the people had hope, a hope for the future, a hope for peace.

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:30.650
He even demonstrated that he had power far beyond any human ruler.

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:42.700
Lord Mary is here.

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:44.700
He isn't in here.

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.700
My brother would not have died.

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:58.049
Lazarus, come out.

00:23:58.049 --> 00:24:21.019
Free him and let him go.

00:24:21.019 --> 00:24:27.019
There's so much we can learn from Jesus' miracles, works and teachings.

00:24:27.019 --> 00:24:30.019
They reveal Jehovah's purpose and power.

00:24:30.019 --> 00:24:37.019
They show how enjoyable, how peaceful life will be under God's Messianic ruler.

00:24:37.019 --> 00:24:41.019
Humans alive at this time could see visible proof of this.

00:24:41.019 --> 00:24:47.019
Jesus' ministry accomplished so much in just three and a half years.

00:24:47.019 --> 00:24:54.019
The prophecy regarding the Messiah continued to be fulfilled as His opposers succeeded in putting Him to death.

00:24:54.019 --> 00:25:14.210
With the sacrifice of Jesus' perfect human life, the entire arrangement for worshipping Jehovah had changed.

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:17.210
There was no longer a need for animal sacrifices.

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:22.210
Pure worship was no longer centered around the temple in Jerusalem.

00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:27.210
The only way to worship Jehovah acceptably was through the Messiah.

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:35.210
Now people everywhere could find the way to peace through faith in Jesus' ransom sacrifice.

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:39.210
The Jewish system of worship under the Mosaic law was over.

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:43.210
Jerusalem in the temple no longer had Jehovah's favor.

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:48.210
Jesus' perfect human sacrifice was the only solution for lasting peace.

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:53.210
So what did this mean for the city of Jerusalem and the temple?

00:25:54.210 --> 00:26:00.210
Well, before His death, Jesus provided His followers with a warning regarding Jerusalem's destruction.

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:04.210
In Luke 21, 20 and 21, He says,

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:12.210
When you see Jerusalem surrounded by encamped armies, then know that the desolating of her has drawn near.

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:18.210
Let those in the midst of her leave and let those in the countryside not enter into her.

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:21.210
A good ruler guides His people.

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:25.210
Although it wasn't yet time for Him to take the throne as ruler of God's kingdom,

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:30.210
Jesus, by the way He acted, gave us insight into the kind of ruler He would be.

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:37.319
By providing first-century Christians with a warning to leave Jerusalem and all Judea,

00:26:37.319 --> 00:26:41.319
He was guiding them and protecting them.

00:26:41.319 --> 00:26:48.319
Jesus prophesied the destruction of the city and just a few decades later, that prophecy came true.

00:26:48.319 --> 00:26:55.319
The Roman Empire still had control of Judea and tensions ran high between the Romans and the Jews.

00:26:55.319 --> 00:26:59.319
Eventually, the Jews revolted against Roman rule.

00:26:59.319 --> 00:27:17.630
With the city surrounded and Roman forces closing in, it seemed there was no way out.

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:21.630
But Jehovah's Word cannot go unfulfilled.

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:25.630
For no apparent reason, the Roman forces withdrew.

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:34.569
For faithful Christians, this was their opportunity.

00:27:34.569 --> 00:27:36.569
It's simple.

00:27:36.569 --> 00:27:41.569
Those who followed Jesus' direction to leave Judea were guided to safety.

00:27:41.569 --> 00:27:46.569
For those who delayed, escape became difficult or impossible.

00:27:46.569 --> 00:28:00.539
There was no doubt Jerusalem no longer enjoyed Jehovah's special favor and protection.

00:28:00.539 --> 00:28:11.220
The city and its temple were completely destroyed.

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:27.779
There are parallels we can draw from the warning Jesus gave to those first-century Christians.

00:28:27.779 --> 00:28:38.779
To the warning we have been given for our day, Jesus gave us one composite sign that indicates the destruction of this current system of things is very close.

00:28:38.779 --> 00:28:44.779
Prophecies in the Bible give us no doubt we are living in the last days.

00:28:44.779 --> 00:28:53.779
Jehovah has not revealed all the details of how everything will work out, but we know that everything he has revealed will come true.

00:28:53.779 --> 00:29:02.779
This includes details outlining how world events would unfold in the time of the end before mankind would experience permanent peace.

00:29:02.779 --> 00:29:11.779
Remember, Daniel's prophecy indicated that there would be only one dominant world power in place at the time of the end.

00:29:11.779 --> 00:29:17.779
By World War I, the power represented by the feet of iron and clay had emerged.

00:29:17.779 --> 00:29:25.779
During that war, Britain and America forged a partnership that continued through the Second World War.

00:29:25.779 --> 00:29:35.769
This means a special relationship between the British Commonwealth and Empire and the United States of America.

00:29:35.769 --> 00:29:48.769
Neither the sure prevention of war nor the continuous rise of world organizations will begin without what I have called the paternal association

00:29:48.769 --> 00:29:57.559
of the English-speaking people.

00:29:57.559 --> 00:30:02.559
These two countries continue to be a dual English-speaking world power.

00:30:02.559 --> 00:30:08.559
The characteristics of iron and clay used to represent this world power are significant.

00:30:08.559 --> 00:30:23.559
And as the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay, so the kingdom will be partly strong and partly fragile.

00:30:23.559 --> 00:30:31.559
At times, the United States and Britain have displayed iron-like strength through their involvement in armed conflicts.

00:30:31.559 --> 00:30:36.559
However, iron, mixed with clay, is considerably weakened.

00:30:36.559 --> 00:30:45.559
This can be observed as common people undermine the Anglo-American world power's ability to act with iron-like strength.

00:30:45.559 --> 00:30:53.559
As the political and social developments foretold in the Bible come to a climax, we have a measure of peace.

00:30:53.559 --> 00:31:03.380
We know Jehovah will guide his people, even as the world's spiritual and moral conditions sinks to new depths.

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:08.380
As many in the first century Jerusalem continued their lives as if nothing had changed.

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:13.380
So too today, many continue on with their lives.

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:21.380
Meanwhile, we remain alert as we see fulfillment of Bible prophecy right before our eyes.

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:30.380
In the days of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed.

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:34.380
The book of Revelation tells us what will soon happen.

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:41.380
The political rulers of the world will give the United Nations unprecedented power and authority.

00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:46.380
The Apostle Paul foretold that the nations will declare peace and security.

00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:49.380
But it won't prove to be true peace.

00:31:49.380 --> 00:32:05.519
The nation supporting the UN will attack the institutions of false religion.

00:32:05.519 --> 00:32:13.519
Then a coalition of Earth's governments that the prophet Ezekiel calls God of the land of May God will attack God's people.

00:32:13.519 --> 00:32:17.519
Yet we don't need to be fearful.

00:32:17.519 --> 00:32:21.519
That's when we can put into action all of the lessons we've learned.

00:32:21.519 --> 00:32:27.519
Those who trust and obey Jehovah's guidance can look to the near future with confidence.

00:32:27.519 --> 00:32:32.519
As we've seen, Jehovah has always been in control of the situation.

00:32:32.519 --> 00:32:37.519
He has never guided his people in a certain direction, then failed to provide for them.

00:32:37.519 --> 00:32:44.519
That's why we can say that the lessons we learn from the faithful men we've studied are more than just lessons.

00:32:44.519 --> 00:32:49.519
This has been Jehovah paving the way for peace from the start.

00:32:50.519 --> 00:32:54.519
Looking back, we see exactly how Jehovah has led his people.

00:32:54.519 --> 00:32:58.519
It took many years, but he's been in control the whole time.

00:32:58.519 --> 00:33:02.519
Would it make sense to think he isn't in control anymore?

00:33:02.519 --> 00:33:09.519
No power in heaven or on earth can prevent Jehovah from accomplishing his express purpose.

00:33:09.519 --> 00:33:15.519
He has never relinquished control, and he is still guiding his people.

00:33:16.519 --> 00:33:18.519
Now think about this.

00:33:18.519 --> 00:33:30.519
If Jehovah has guided his people to this point, we can have full confidence that trust and obedience to his direction will prove to be our salvation.

00:33:30.519 --> 00:33:34.519
Even if a way out seems impossible.

00:33:34.519 --> 00:33:38.519
Jehovah is all powerful.

00:33:38.519 --> 00:33:46.259
He's going to help us through whatever we may face.

00:33:46.259 --> 00:33:59.390
We won't have to fight, and we won't need to fear annihilation.

00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:06.329
Jehovah has things under control.

00:34:06.329 --> 00:34:11.340
We'll not be passed on to any other people.

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:15.340
It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms.

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:35.750
We'll stand forever.

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:44.230
God's kingdom will fill and renew the entire earth.

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:47.230
Jehovah's promises will become completely fulfilled.

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:54.769
Lasting peace will finally become a reality for all mankind.

00:34:54.769 --> 00:35:01.769
Just imagine what faithful servants have to look forward to under Jesus' heavenly rule.

00:35:01.769 --> 00:35:06.769
He will be able to provide what no man ever could.

00:35:06.769 --> 00:35:09.769
Can you imagine what that will be like?

00:35:09.769 --> 00:35:35.340
For look, I am creating new heavens and a new earth,

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:38.340
and the former things will not be called to mind.

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:44.420
Nor will they come up into the heart.

00:35:44.420 --> 00:36:17.769
The righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it.

00:36:17.769 --> 00:36:26.750
He will swallow up death forever, and the sovereign Lord Jehovah will wipe away the tears from all faces.

00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:42.650
He will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more.

00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:49.650
Either one morning, nor outcry, nor pain be any more.

00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:52.650
The former things have passed away.

00:36:52.650 --> 00:37:24.949
At that time, the eyes of the blind will be open,

00:37:24.949 --> 00:37:34.780
and the ears of the deaf will be unstopped.

00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:41.500
At that time, the lame will leap like the deer,

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:45.500
and the tongue of the speechless will shout for joy,

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:59.750
or waters will burst forth in the wilderness, and streams in the desert plain.

00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:09.440
They will build houses and live in them,

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:21.719
and they will plant vineyards and eat their fruities.

00:38:21.719 --> 00:38:38.139
For the days of my people will be like the days of a tree,

00:38:38.139 --> 00:38:48.539
and the work of their hands by chosen ones will enjoy to the full.

00:38:48.539 --> 00:38:51.539
But the meek will possess the earth,

00:38:51.539 --> 00:39:01.219
and they will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.
