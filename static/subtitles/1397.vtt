00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.089
I'm making a friend with God.

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:07.089
Yeah, I don't know how to do that.

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:10.089
Make a friend, but you've done fine with me.

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:12.089
But I can see you.

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:15.089
But God, a friend?

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.089
Seriously?

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:18.089
How about what you can see?

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:20.089
What does creation teach us about him?

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:21.089
Hmm.

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:23.089
Not much.

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:26.089
Maybe evolve or your species dies?

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:28.089
It doesn't really help.

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:32.090
Well, I'm not talking about evolution.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.090
I'm talking about the things that God created.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.090
You don't suppose he's got a little workshop up there

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.090
building things one at a time, do you?

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.090
In the real world, things evolve.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.090
It's all random.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.090
I don't know what that tells me about him.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.090
I wasn't ready for this.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.090
Evolution isn't my strong suit.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:07.799
I need help.

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.799
This could be good.

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.799
Many who believe evolution.

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.799
Ancient tidal pool chemicals spontaneously assembled.

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:19.799
Too deep.

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:20.799
Wait.

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.799
Maybe what does the evidence reveal?

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.799
For a cell to survive DNA, RNA,

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.799
inanimate chemicals.

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.799
Probability.

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.799
I'm not sure this is what she needs.

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.799
Her real issue was getting to know someone she can't see.

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:50.939
That's the best place to begin.

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.939
One widespread false teaching.

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.939
Rob's people of hope implies that human life has no purpose.

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.939
This could be it.

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:03.939
Establish the positive.

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.939
What creation really says about Jehovah.

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.939
Versus whatever evolution obscures.

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:13.939
Okay, so you got me thinking.

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:15.939
And I did some research.

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:16.939
Yeah.

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:18.939
And I think you really like what I found.

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:19.939
Okay.

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:20.939
Come on, come sit down.

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:21.939
Okay.
