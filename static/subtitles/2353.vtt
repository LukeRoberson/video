00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:15.220
How can you make important points of instruction more vivid as you teach?

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.219
Use a visual aid.

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:23.219
That's what Jehovah did when speaking with Abraham as recorded Genesis 15.5.

00:00:23.219 --> 00:00:26.219
Jehovah brought Abraham outside and said,

00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:31.219
Look up, please, to the heavens and count the stars.

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:39.219
Imagine Abraham looking up to the heavens on a clear night and seeing thousands of stars twinkling like diamonds.

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:44.219
Jehovah then made the point of instruction clear when he said,

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.219
So your offspring will become Abraham understood.

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:54.219
And he remembered Jehovah's promise for the rest of his life.

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:58.219
How might we use visual aids in our teaching?

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:05.219
We can choose pictures, diagrams, maps, timelines, or other items to highlight,

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:10.219
not minor details, but important concepts.

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:15.219
And whether we're teaching in the field ministry or in the congregation,

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:20.219
we need to make sure that our listeners can see the visual aid.

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:29.219
As we watch the following example, consider whether this use of a visual aid is appropriate or inappropriate.

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:37.219
Rumors are like this balloon full of hot air floating through the room.

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:45.219
What should we do with rumors to flate them before they travel any further?

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:49.760
Was that an appropriate use of visual aid?

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.760
Oh, it'll be remembered, but for all the wrong reasons.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.760
Our objective in using visual aids is not to shock or entertain the audience.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.760
Let's give the speaker another chance to make appropriate use of a visual aid.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.759
Why should we spend time getting to know our brothers and sisters?

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:17.759
Well, we could compare them to this beautiful rock called the geode.

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:26.759
If we look past the surface imperfections and take the time to get to know our brothers and sisters,

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:34.759
we may come to know their beautiful inner qualities, the secret person of the heart.

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:37.759
Simple and clear.

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:41.759
Our publications also use visual aids.

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:45.759
How can we make good use of them in the ministry?

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:48.759
Let's watch your brother conducting a Bible study.

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:51.759
Does he make good use of the artwork?

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:55.759
What will life be like in the coming paradise?

00:02:55.759 --> 00:03:01.759
In order to visualize what we just considered in paragraph 17 through 23, notice the artwork on page 37.

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:05.759
Nice, right? Let's move on to paragraph 24.

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:10.759
That publisher briefly called attention to illustration.

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:13.759
But he could have made better use of it.

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:21.759
While we don't need to focus on minor details in the picture, we should try to highlight key aspects of the artwork.

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:24.759
Let's watch him try again.

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:27.759
What will life be like in the coming paradise?

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:34.759
In order to visualize what we'll consider in paragraph 17 through 23, notice the artwork on page 37.

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:41.009
What aspects of this scene are different from life in today's world?

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:43.009
Everybody's happy.

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:46.009
The whole earth will be a paradise.

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:51.009
What else? Does anyone in this scene have glasses or a cane?

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:53.009
No.

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:55.009
Sickness and death will be gone too.

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:57.009
What about war and violence?

00:03:57.009 --> 00:04:00.009
What do you see in the picture?

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:04.009
Everybody's getting along. Even people of different races.

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:09.009
Exactly. There will even be peace between humans and the animals.

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:14.009
But you might be thinking that's just too good to be true.

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:19.009
Well, let's now consider the verses from the Bible that provide the basis for this picture.

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:21.009
Would you please read paragraph 17?

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:29.579
In this case, the publisher used the artwork to preview information to follow.

00:04:29.579 --> 00:04:33.579
We can also use the artwork to review key points.

00:04:33.579 --> 00:04:39.579
The important thing is for our listeners to remember the point of the visual aid.

00:04:40.579 --> 00:04:44.579
Brothers who conduct a watchtower study and the congregation Bible study

00:04:44.579 --> 00:04:51.110
should make good use of the visual aids that appear in the lesson.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.110
When we select visual aids that enhance our teaching rather than detract from it,

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:03.110
we'll honor Jehovah and make important points of instruction memorable to our audience.
