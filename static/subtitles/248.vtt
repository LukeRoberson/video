00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:19.039
Mum's been working hard lately, but I wish she worked harder for Jehovah.

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.640
I try to help out where I can.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:35.420
Oh, by the way, I'm Jin.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.420
Every day starts the same.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.420
I grab a drink of water.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.590
I say hi to Jin.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.590
He's in my congregation.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.590
And then, there's Mikiong.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.590
Okay, here we go.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.590
I say hello.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.590
She says something clever.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.590
I try to leave.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.590
So, this is different.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.590
She's having trouble in math and needs my help.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:18.420
I don't want to be rude, but if I help her with her homework,

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.420
how far could the relationship develop?

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:56.659
How do you say no to a girl like her?

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:22.030
Why can't I get out of my head?

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.759
Things are always better when Uncle and Auntie are around.

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:30.759
Even Mum makes sure she's home for dinner and broadcast night.

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:42.539
Uncle wants to work together in service this weekend.

00:02:42.539 --> 00:03:15.939
Maybe that will help clear my head.

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:18.939
Jehovah must be disappointed in me.

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:23.599
I couldn't take it anymore.

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:28.599
It was difficult, but I told Uncle everything.

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:36.599
I felt guilty that I knew I shouldn't, but I liked the attention.

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:43.189
We read Genesis 39 7 through 12.

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:46.189
I knew the account about Potiphar's wife,

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:50.189
but he mentioned something I hadn't thought of before.

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:53.189
He told Potiphar's wife,

00:03:53.189 --> 00:04:00.189
how could I commit this great badness and actually sin against God?

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:03.189
But why did Joseph have to flee?

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:13.360
Joseph fought her every day,

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.360
but she wasn't going to give up.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:21.360
In her mind, it wasn't a question of if, but when?

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:29.519
There came a point where he had to flee.

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:32.519
I explained why I was ending the relationship,

00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:47.209
but she would not give up.

00:04:47.209 --> 00:04:50.209
You know the last thing she said to me?

00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:54.209
That I was a coward, but she's wrong.

00:04:54.209 --> 00:04:59.209
You're never a coward if you run to Jehovah.
