Hi, I'm Sophia. I have a great video about God's promise for the Earth.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.730
Oh, sweetheart, thank you. I'm not interested.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.149
And you can read the Bible and watch videos.

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:23.149
Really busy, kid.

00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:34.020
Can we take a break?

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.020
Yeah. A break already?

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:48.799
A break might be nice, but before we go,

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:53.799
do you remember when Jesus preached, did everybody listen to him?

00:00:53.799 --> 00:01:01.840
No, so why didn't Jesus give up?

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.840
Because he wanted everyone to hear the good news.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.840
That's right. So how about we each try another house?
