00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:23.679
What are the things that I value, the things that mean the most to me?

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:36.850
Are the things that will help me to be, to be the person I want to be.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.850
Each new day, there are choices to be made.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:50.740
Sometimes the choice will need to be a trend.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:57.729
The time I have can never be replayed.

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:02.729
The steps I take can never be retrained.

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:11.650
That's why I want to choose carefully.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.650
And choose what really means the most to me.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:27.030
How will I honor Jehovah?

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:36.120
One who means the most to me.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:43.000
The best I can offer to him.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And he deserves the best I can be.
