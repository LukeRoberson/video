00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:11.539
during his earthly ministry, Jesus expelled demons. He healed the sick. He fed

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:20.219
multitudes. He even raised the dead. But was he known as the great demon

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:27.579
expeller, the great healer, the great feeder of multitudes, or the great

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:37.619
resurrector? No. But he was known as the great teacher. Why? Because he focused

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:44.020
primarily his efforts on the preaching and teaching work. But now, why did he do

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:52.420
this? Well, he knew physical miracles would only bring temporary benefits. He

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:59.100
knew once freed from the demons, ones that were healed, fed, even resurrected,

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:07.659
would eventually grow old and die. So how could he help people permanently? Well,

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:14.500
he knew only he could do it by teaching them the life-saving knowledge about

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.540
his father, Jehovah. He well knew the truthfulness of what he stated as

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:28.140
recorded at John 17-3. This means everlasting life. They're coming to know the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:35.180
only true God and of the one he sent, Jesus Christ. So even though he did many

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:42.459
amazing things, he focused primarily on the preaching and teaching work,

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:49.459
becoming the greatest teacher ever to walk this earth. In fact, when officers

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:55.180
were sent to arrest him, remember what happened? They came back empty handed. Why?

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:05.939
Well, they said, never has any man spoken like this. They were so awestruck by his

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.060
teaching. They couldn't even bring themselves to arrest him. Large crowds would

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.180
stick with him for days, even without eating, in order to listen to his teaching.

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:25.139
In contrast to the quality of Jesus' teaching, Acts chapter 20 tells us about the

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:32.780
apostle Paul giving a long, long talk. And during that talk, remember the young

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:40.659
man Uticus sank into a deep, deep sleep and even fell out of the third story

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:46.219
window of a building. Now, of course, Paul resurrected him, but probably he felt

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:55.539
responsible for putting him to sleep like that. But no offense to Paul. I'm sure he

00:02:55.539 --> 00:03:01.740
was doing the best he could. But obviously his teaching was not on a par with

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.379
that of the great teacher. And that makes me think of what a brother said to me in

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:12.539
a teasing way. He said, brother, I always look forward to your talks. I know I'm

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:21.810
going to wake up totally refreshed. Well, it's really true. None of us, like Paul,

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:28.849
can begin to match the quality of teaching of the great teacher. But what are we

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:36.610
told at first Peter 221? We are told to follow his steps closely. We can't do it

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:42.530
perfectly, but we're told to do it as closely as we can. So that means that all

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.090
of us, but especially as we're talking to you dear Gilead students, soon to be

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:55.689
graduates, you must make the preaching and teaching work a priority. And we must

00:03:55.689 --> 00:04:00.650
do our best. You must do your best to improve in your teaching. And how can you do

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:07.490
that by imitating the great teacher? During this talk, even though much of what

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:13.729
we will talk about will concern the public ministry, what we're going to discuss, much

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:20.970
of it would be applicable to teaching on a personal level and in the congregation. So

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:27.970
especially you brothers, but all of us, we want to imitate Jesus teaching methods as

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:35.449
we shepherd Jehovah sheep on a personal level. And as we do so on a congregational level

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:44.569
from the platform. Now here's a question, how did Jesus become the great teacher? Well,

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:52.410
the Bible tells us that for eons and eons of time, as a master worker beside the Jehovah,

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:59.649
he carefully observed and he imitated his father. And he thereby acquired amazing

00:04:59.649 --> 00:05:05.290
teaching skills. See, he learned from the greatest teacher. And no wonder he became

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:11.769
the great teacher. He learned from his heavenly father. And he appropriately gave credit

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:17.889
where it belonged. A go to John chapter eight, please. And notice how he gave the credit

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:27.129
for his speaking and teaching where it belonged. John ate the be part of verse 28. I do nothing

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:38.009
of my own initiative. But just as a father taught me, I speak these things. Yes, he imitated

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:47.009
his father. Now we want to imitate him. But what specific teaching methods did he utilize?

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:53.089
Did he learn from the greatest teacher? Well, let's discuss four. Now one, he taught

00:05:53.089 --> 00:06:03.410
with enthusiasm and conviction. Matthew 729, for he was teaching them as a person having

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:11.449
authority and not as there's scribes. So did not indicate enthusiasm, conviction, authority,

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:18.290
he taught. So if we're not enthusiastic about what we teach in the ministry or from the

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:24.930
platform, how can we expect our listeners to be enthusiastic about it? So never would

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:33.290
we want to come across half-hearted in our teaching. Just like enthusiastic teaching is contagious,

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:38.889
half-hearted teaching is contagious too, isn't it? You could perhaps liken it to yawning.

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:43.689
The one person yawning in a room pretty soon everybody's yawning. And that could be the

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:51.610
way with half-hearted teaching. But as a caution, we don't want to be theatrical in our speaking.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:07:00.649
That means we wouldn't want to use extreme gestures or dramatic expressions, overly theatrical,

00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:06.569
even theatrical. Why? Because now you end up drawing attention to yourself, don't you?

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:12.329
Rather than to what we're teaching. And that's emphasis in the wrong place, isn't it? But now

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:20.089
let's talk about a second method, the great teacher utilized. He was a good listener. Where did he

00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:28.490
learn this pattern of being a good listener? We'll open up to Isaiah chapter 50, please. And notice

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:36.250
what it's prophetically said about Jesus and where he learned to be a good listener. Notice

00:07:36.329 --> 00:07:45.290
chapter 50 and right at the end of verse 4, let's begin there. He, Jehovah, awakens my ear to listen

00:07:46.329 --> 00:07:53.209
like the taut ones. The sovereign Lord, Jehovah, has opened my ear and I was not rebellious.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:08:00.810
I did not turn in the opposite direction. So Jehovah opened his ear, trained in to be a good

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:06.649
listener and he responded well, did he? Not. And that's why when he became a human,

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:14.889
from childhood on, he continued his pattern of being a good listener, didn't he? You recall the

00:08:14.889 --> 00:08:21.689
account in Luke chapter 2, when Joseph and Mary finally found Jesus after three days and he's

00:08:21.689 --> 00:08:26.889
only 12 years old, where do they find him? It says he was sitting in the midst of the teachers there

00:08:26.889 --> 00:08:36.009
in the temple and listening to them and then also asking them questions. Then when he began his

00:08:36.009 --> 00:08:43.289
career as a disciple maker at 30, it was second nature, wasn't it? To be a good listener. Now think

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:52.409
of this, even though he had more to say than any other human has ever had to say, he knew the value

00:08:52.409 --> 00:09:00.570
of pausing, drawing out his audience and then really listening to them. And the same is true

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:05.049
with us. See, you may think, especially after Gilead's school, you've got a lot to say.

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:11.690
But if you're going to imitate the great teacher, we have to use self-control, we have to pause

00:09:12.409 --> 00:09:18.250
and draw people out and then really listen to them. And when we serve as an assistant, which

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:24.649
sometimes is half the time, we want to be active listeners. See, what does that mean to be an

00:09:24.649 --> 00:09:32.730
active listener? Well, maybe you would nod periodically in agreement. Or maybe you would add

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:39.049
some little comment, well, it's very interesting. You might even ask for clarification. People like

00:09:39.049 --> 00:09:44.169
to clarify what they're saying, say, shows you're really interested in what's happening. So whether

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:50.809
we're the one presenting or the one as an assistant, we want to be an active listener. There's probably

00:09:50.809 --> 00:09:59.129
nothing more distracting than having you're an assistant playing with a dog. Or maybe looking down

00:09:59.129 --> 00:10:03.289
the street, see what's happening down the street. Pretty soon your householders looking down the street,

00:10:03.289 --> 00:10:12.009
see what's happening. See, be an active listener. Well, let's get our third method, the great teacher

00:10:12.169 --> 00:10:19.529
used. He used thought-provoking questions. And methods two and three do go hand-to-hand, don't they?

00:10:19.529 --> 00:10:26.490
Because if you ask good questions, you're likely going to have more to listen to. But why do some

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:33.690
of Jehovah's people tend to shy away perhaps from using questions? Why do they just like to present

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:39.690
information, kind of control everything? Well, if you think about it, it's probably easier to just

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:46.889
present information, even though not nearly as effective. See, when you ask questions and then you

00:10:46.889 --> 00:10:55.049
get a response from the householder, it's kind of like bouncing a football. Now, you bounce a basket

00:10:55.049 --> 00:11:01.370
ball is predictable. It's not a football. And the same way, people come back with all kinds of

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:07.690
responses. And you've got to be willing and able to adapt according to their responses. Some don't

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:13.129
like that uncertainty. So they would rather just present information. But as we said, that's not

00:11:13.129 --> 00:11:20.649
going to be nearly as effective as those who have learned to imitate the great teacher and effectively

00:11:20.649 --> 00:11:29.049
teach with questions. Now, you Gilead students have certainly seen the value of good questions during

00:11:29.049 --> 00:11:36.250
class. See, it made it so much more enjoyable, didn't it? And it enhanced your learning tremendously

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:44.889
when your instructors use these good questions. Why is that more effective to proficiently use

00:11:44.889 --> 00:11:51.610
questions? Well, for one thing, you involve your listener in the conversation. And what do you

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:57.850
enjoy more being given a sermon or being involved in a conversation? Answer's obviously that.

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:03.210
So you involve the listener more enjoyable. Another thing, you gain valuable information

00:12:04.009 --> 00:12:10.730
about your listener, which you can use to really help that one. Well, what are types of questions

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:20.409
we can use? You can use what do you think questions? Jesus used them as an example, Matthew 1812,

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:27.690
what do you think? If a man has 100 sheep, one strays, we know the rest of the illustration,

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:31.610
but he started out, what do you think? And people generally like to give their opinion.

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:38.570
And in a sense, there's no wrong answer, is it? Because whatever they say, that's what they think.

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:45.289
That's what you ask for, right? You ask, what do you think? And people like to give their opinion,

00:12:45.289 --> 00:12:53.289
it makes it enjoyable. You can also use multiple choice questions. That sometimes makes it easier

00:12:53.289 --> 00:13:01.450
for the householder to answer. Jesus gave an example in Matthew 1725. He said, Simon,

00:13:02.649 --> 00:13:11.690
from whom did the kings of the earth receive duties or headtax from their sons or from the strangers?

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:18.730
Many of our tracks use multiple choice questions, don't they? And we can effectively use those.

00:13:18.809 --> 00:13:25.929
And if you think about it, the right question can often enable us to overcome potential

00:13:25.929 --> 00:13:31.129
conversation stoppers and keep the conversation going. For example, if a person says,

00:13:31.129 --> 00:13:38.490
you people don't believe in Jesus, we might say, well, may I please ask, what do you say that?

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:45.690
Does someone tell you that about us? See, harmless questions can keep that conversation going

00:13:45.769 --> 00:13:50.330
until you get valuable information that perhaps you can use to help the person.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:57.210
The person says, I don't believe in the Bible. May I please ask, why you feel that way?

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:04.330
May I ask, how long have you felt that way? See, keep it going. One brother said during

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:10.570
Pioneer's School, he had those questions drilled into his head about why do you feel that way?

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:14.809
How long have you felt that way? A woman came to the door, said, I can't talk him pregnant.

00:14:16.009 --> 00:14:25.659
And he says, well, may I ask, how long you felt that way? Don't do that. We said before,

00:14:25.659 --> 00:14:34.220
you got to be a good listener. But then what about using thought-provoking questions when conducting

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:41.740
a Bible study? As you well know, our new study book is loaded with thought-provoking questions,

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:49.580
and we certainly want to fully utilize them. But occasionally, we may need to add auxiliary

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:55.740
questions. But remember, most of what a good teacher says during a Bible study is in the form

00:14:56.299 --> 00:15:03.340
of questions. I know myself, I've really tried hard to train myself when I'm about ready to make

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:09.740
a statement, say something, wait a minute, let me change that, let me change it to a question,

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:16.700
and let me draw out from the student what I was about to say. See, that's going to be more

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:26.059
effective, isn't it? It's normally much better than explaining a scripture to a student having

00:15:26.059 --> 00:15:33.980
the student explain it to you. And don't be afraid of a little silence. See, if you ask a question

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:39.179
and they're silence, some of us think, well, we have to quickly fill in the gap by saying something.

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:45.179
But if they're thinking, let them think. Of course, you have to know your student.

00:15:46.059 --> 00:15:50.700
If they have no clue what the answer is, then don't let them just sit there and sizzle.

00:15:52.299 --> 00:15:59.899
Throw them a rope, throw them an auxiliary question. But now, we're going to go to our fourth

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:08.379
method that the great teacher learned from the greatest teacher he effectively used illustrations.

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:14.700
And that was certainly a powerful teaching tool, indeed. Matthew 1334,

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:24.379
without an illustration, Jesus would not speak. But here's a question. Do you think that Jesus

00:16:25.019 --> 00:16:30.860
illustrations were the product of spur of the moment thinking? Well, there's no doubt about it.

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:35.419
It is perfect brain certainly helped to be able to come up with amazing illustrations. But

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:43.419
nevertheless, the indication is that he cultivated the ability to effectively use illustrations if

00:16:43.419 --> 00:16:50.940
he saw a shepherd, for example, taking care of a sheep. He likely meditated, now, how can I use this

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:58.299
situation to teach vital truths? He did the same when he saw, for example, a fisherman letting down

00:16:58.299 --> 00:17:08.779
his nets, a farmer sewing seed, maybe builders constructing a tower. See, how can I use this in

00:17:08.779 --> 00:17:18.220
make powerful illustrations to teach vital truths? Even simple items like birds, lilies, a lamp

00:17:19.019 --> 00:17:26.859
on a lampstand, a wine skin, leaven, mustard seed, salt, the young child. How can I use these simple

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:33.740
items to teach vital truths? And he was amazing how he how he did that. And the same is true with

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:39.420
us. See, all around us, if we train ourselves to think that way, there are circumstances,

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:46.539
there are situations, there are even just items that we can use and make them into powerful

00:17:46.539 --> 00:17:52.539
illustrations, and we can powerfully elevate the quality of our teaching. Now, here's an example.

00:17:53.259 --> 00:18:00.299
Some time ago, a brother noticed a little baby with a pacifier. This pacifier had been dipped

00:18:00.299 --> 00:18:05.980
in sugar water, put in the baby's mouth, and he was thinking, you know, that's a very good illustration

00:18:06.859 --> 00:18:15.099
of many, many in Christendom. They're satisfied what they have, even though they have no real

00:18:15.099 --> 00:18:22.380
spiritual nourishment. But we're looking for those who are not satisfied, those who are conscious

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:27.420
of their spiritual need. And he was able to use that in a talk. Where are cautions

00:18:28.299 --> 00:18:33.900
regarding the use of illustrations? Well, here's just a couple. An illustration should not be too

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:43.980
long or complicated. If it is, simplify it or discard it. That's what the school guidebook tells us.

00:18:44.859 --> 00:18:50.779
Here's another caution. To be effective, the illustration must be familiar to

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:59.420
and fit your audience. For example, what if he used the illustration, Satan's system is like

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:05.099
a male platypus. Now, in some parts of Australia, that might be a good illustration.

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:13.900
Because they know a male platypus looks harmless, he looks innocent, but his nine legs are armed

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:21.819
with ankle spurs, connected to venom glands. So he looks harmless, but he could be very dangerous.

00:19:21.819 --> 00:19:26.859
But that only works, see, if you're dealing with people that are familiar with that particular

00:19:26.859 --> 00:19:35.500
animal. But skillfully selected and used illustrations are very effective. They stimulate thinking,

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:42.859
they arrest and hold attention, they motivate the heart and conscience of our listener,

00:19:42.859 --> 00:19:49.500
and they serve as powerful memory aids. See, a good illustration is going to be remembered years

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:56.859
later along with, and this is an important thing, along with a point that it was designed to highlight.

00:19:57.819 --> 00:20:04.619
Well, there we have four teaching methods utilized by the great teacher that he learned from the

00:20:04.619 --> 00:20:12.220
greatest teacher as we said. And we want to do our best to copy, imitate his way of teaching. And I

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:19.339
know you give students, you have an enhanced desire to do that in the congregation and also in your

00:20:19.339 --> 00:20:27.500
your territory that you're going to be working again. So let's work hard to teach with enthusiasm

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:34.779
and conviction. Let's be a good listener. Let's use thought provoking questions.

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:43.500
And let's use effective illustrations. If you work hard, your dear students almost graduates,

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:50.299
to employ these same teaching techniques, then you're going to be a lot more skillful in reaching the

00:20:50.299 --> 00:20:55.500
hearts of your listeners. And there's a lot at stake, isn't it? I mean, you think about it,

00:20:55.500 --> 00:21:01.180
the lives of our brothers and sisters are at stake. And with the art of teaching, learn from the

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:07.980
great teacher, we want to help as many of them as we can to make it into that new world.

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:14.619
And then also the lives of honest, started ones in our territory. They hang in the balance, don't they?

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:21.980
So we want to find them before it's too late. And using the art of teaching, learn from the great

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:30.299
teacher, we want to motivate them to come into the safety of Jehovah's organization. And if you

00:21:30.299 --> 00:21:35.420
think about it, it's good to remember that what we're doing now in the way of learning to teach

00:21:36.299 --> 00:21:44.299
is really preparing us for the greatest teaching campaign ever in all human history,

00:21:44.299 --> 00:21:50.460
the teaching of billions who will be coming back in the resurrection. You could say, our work now

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:57.900
is like a warm-up, isn't it? It's a warm-up for that greatest teaching campaign that is just

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:06.059
around the corner. So please, continue to observe carefully the teaching of the great teacher,

00:22:06.059 --> 00:22:12.140
and you learn a lot about that in school. No doubt about it. And make Jehovah continue to bless you,

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:21.099
most beloved. Gilead students, almost graduates, may he bless you as you apply all the wonderful

00:22:21.099 --> 00:22:29.259
things you've learned during this school. And that includes learning to imitate the great teacher.
