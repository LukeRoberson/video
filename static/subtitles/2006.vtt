00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:12.539
And in production to the book of Nahum, the prophet Nahum was likely living in Judah when he wrote the book bearing his name.

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:22.910
Nahum's message focuses primarily on a single theme, the complete destruction of the Assyrian city of Nineveh.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:32.469
Nineveh, known for its violence and brutality, was referred to as the city of bloodshed.

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:41.469
At one time in response to the judgment message delivered by the prophet Jonah, the inhabitants of Nineveh repented of their wickedness.

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:54.469
However, the Ninevites eventually returned to their wicked ways, and about two centuries after Jonah's prophecy, Jehovah used Nahum to prophesy against Nineveh again.

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:03.070
The book of Nahum was completed sometime before 632 BCE, the year Nineveh was destroyed.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:17.290
Nahum was a contemporary of the prophet Zephaniah and Jeremiah. The book of Nahum contains three chapters.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:24.290
In chapter 1, Nahum proclaims Jehovah's judgment against the city of Nineveh.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:32.290
The entire city with its collection of pagan gods made of wood, stone, and metal will be completely destroyed.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.290
This is good news for the people of Judah.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:43.290
Free from that cruel and dangerous enemy, they can celebrate their festivals in peace.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:53.290
Did you know We can trace Nineveh's origin back to the days of Nimrod, the founder of the First Empire to exist after the flood.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:01.209
Chapters 2 and 3 describe Nineveh's destruction in greater detail.

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:15.210
Nineveh was a heavily fortified city with high walls and a moat, but Nahum prophesies that the gates of the rivers will be opened and the palace will be dissolved.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:22.210
These words were fulfilled in 632 BCE when flooding caused damage to the city.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:30.210
This permitted the besieging forces of Babylon and media to capture the city and destroy it.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:35.210
Jehovah's prophetic word through Nahum came true in every detail.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:41.840
As you read the book of Nahum, consider how Jehovah hates violence.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:51.840
How Jehovah always fulfills his word and how Jehovah provides comfort for all who seek peace and salvation under his kingdom.
