00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:27.550
In the autumn of 1536, William Tyndale was led from his prison cell in the castle of Elvord

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.750
to the site of his impending execution.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.950
There a post had been prepared for him.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.950
Tyndale was chained to the post, strangled to death,

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.950
and then his body burned before the onlooking crowd.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.950
His crime?

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.950
Tyndale struggled to reconcile the teachings of the church with his own studies of the Bible.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:59.950
William Tyndale died with his faith intact that the Bible is the Word of God.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:10.980
William Tyndale was the first person to seek to translate the Bible from the original languages into English.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.980
Tyndale was born in the late 15th century.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:21.980
He was born in the area of Gloucestershire, but had a chance to go to Oxford and became a priest.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.980
In the 15th century, there was a lot of resistance.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.980
The idea that the Word of God could just simply be accessible by the general people.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:35.980
People knew the Latin Bible from church, which was interpreted by the priest, for them.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.980
They never had direct access to the Bible themselves.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.980
Tyndale was not allowed to do this translation in England.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:55.980
He went to the Bishop of London, asking for his permission to translate the New Testament from the Greek, the original text, into English, but was not given that permission.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.780
Such was the opposition to Bible translation.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.780
The Tyndale later wrote, there was no place to do it in all England.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.780
And so with the help of merchants sympathetic to his cause, Tyndale fled to Germany,

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.780
where he could more easily work on his English translation of the New Testament.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.780
By 1525, his translation was complete and ready to be printed.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.780
The British Library in London holds the answer to what happened next.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.780
Dr. Karin Limper Hertz, a lead curator at the library, is going to help us find out.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.780
So we're looking at a unique copy of the first edition of Tyndale's New Testament, printed in Cologne in 1525.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.780
The Cologne fragment is the only known copy of what exists of Tyndale's first edition of the New Testament.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.780
The fact that it is a fragment shows that it was a dangerous thing to do.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:57.780
The printer had too much to drink and mentioned that he was printing this pro-Lutheran English New Testament for somebody called William Tyndale.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.780
The authorities found out about it and the printer was raided.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.780
Tyndale and his partners ran and this is all that survives today and they went down the Rhine a bit further to Worms.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.780
So the fact they didn't get much further than partway through Matthew is quite indicative of how dangerous it was.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:23.780
The first complete copies of Tyndale's translation of the Christian Greek scriptures were finally printed in the city of Worms in Germany in 1526.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.780
Around 3,000 or more of these books were produced.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:41.520
After leaving Germany, Tyndale moved to Antwerp.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:52.520
This bustling city was ideal for Tyndale. It had a thriving printing industry and its busy port made it easy for his books to reach readers in England.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:04:01.520
Professor Guido Latry has kindly offered to show me around the very streets Tyndale would have walked himself some 500 years ago.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:08.520
What he saw around him here was ordinary people having access to the Bible in Dutch.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.520
He wanted the same for his own folk in England.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:20.519
If you wanted to smuggle Bibles on a large scale into England, this was Northern Europe's biggest seaport.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:26.519
You can't easily smuggle a big volume and a big format.

00:04:26.519 --> 00:04:33.519
So tiny loose leaves that were taken to places like this, these underground sellers, the warehouses,

00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:41.519
and between the leaves of larger books that were not forbidden, the tiny leaves of Tyndale's translation would have been hidden.

00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:46.519
In London, someone would have recognized, aha, these are the stacks at our market.

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:52.519
I must have a look at these and find the loose leaves of Tyndale's Bible.

00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:58.519
There were about 30,000 copies of Tyndale's Bible available by the end of his life.

00:04:58.519 --> 00:05:04.519
This was a brave man and a big man in terms of courage, and in terms of investment, of time,

00:05:04.519 --> 00:05:09.519
and the risk he took are not to be underestimated.

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:14.519
William Tyndale was imprisoned here in Volvod just north of Brussels.

00:05:14.519 --> 00:05:21.519
As he languished in prison for over a year, he no doubt contemplated the cruel death inevitably awaited him.

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:30.519
Tyndale is often renowned for his influence on the English language, but his work was more than that of just scholarly ambition.

00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:37.519
Tyndale loved the Bible. Maybe it can be said of him that he shared the feelings of the Samist,

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:45.560
who spoke of God's word and said, how I do love your law.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:55.560
Despite in tense opposition, the Bible and the wisdom in it survives to this day a faithful transmission of the original writer's words.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.560
No wonder so many have placed such value on the Bible.
