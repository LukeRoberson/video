00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:08.400
Thanks to modern technology, people the world over say that they have more friends than ever.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.080
All they have to do is add a person's name to their list of friends on a social network.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.199
Some boast of having hundreds, even thousands, of such friends.

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:26.679
Others don't have access to the internet, so they make friends the old-fashioned way.

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:32.000
At work, at school, or in the neighborhood.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.799
Having good friends is very important, so we need to ask ourselves, what is true friendship?

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:43.840
Where should I look for true friends?

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.719
How can my choice of friends affect my joy?

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.280
As you watch the following dramatization, think about the effect our brother's choice of

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.159
friends has on his joy.

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:08.790
And believe me, that's not the only dirt I have on Victor.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.950
Okay, we're listening.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.390
So last week he's talking in his office, right?

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.790
And he has no idea that I'm standing right there, and he's bragging to his buddy.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.189
I really didn't want to hear this.

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:27.629
A bunch of them seemed harmless, but this was anything but a building.

00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:31.310
Hey, hey, check out these guys.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.140
It's the viable people.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.340
Uh-oh, don't look now.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.140
They have someone.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.939
They might try to convert us, too.

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:52.140
What is the deal with these people?

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.939
I mean, it's cool if you want to believe in fairy tales and everything, but keep it to

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:57.459
yourself, right?

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:58.459
Exactly.

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:59.459
Exactly.

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:09.539
Those carts are everywhere now.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.830
I couldn't finish my lunch.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:22.419
I had never noticed how sarcastic and negative my co-workers could be.

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:36.020
I had always thought of them as, well, as friends.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:47.240
What kind of friends was I making?

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.159
Did you see the brother's face at the end of the video?

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:52.439
He didn't look very happy.

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:53.840
Why not?

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.439
The association seemed harmless.

00:02:56.439 --> 00:03:00.159
Workmates were just taking their lunch break together.

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:03.639
But their conversation went in a negative direction.

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:08.159
They began talking about finding dirt on a fellow worker.

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:10.280
Then it got personal.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.319
His co-workers started to make fun of the witnesses who were preaching using a cart.

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.599
Please open your Bibles to Proverbs chapter 19.

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:27.280
We're going to read three verses here, and these verses reveal the disappointing reality

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.960
of looking to the world as a source of true friends.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:40.000
Proverbs chapter 19 will start with verse 4 and then read verses 6 and 7.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.599
Both the tracts many friends, but the poor man will be deserted even by his friend.

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:52.919
Many seek the favor of a noble, and everyone is a friend of the man who gives gifts.

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.960
All the brothers of a poor man hate him.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.360
How much more he is shunned by his friends.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:06.080
He pursues them with request, but no one responds.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.719
Friends in the world are often based on selfish motives.

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:18.439
As verse 4 says, wealth attracts friends, poverty drives them away.

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:23.920
Such friendships can be shallow, and they can end abruptly.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:29.759
142-year-old woman had over a thousand friends on her social network.

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:35.800
But not one of those friends responded to her plea for help just before she took her

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.319
own life.

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:43.600
Friendships with the world are not only disappointing, but they can also damage our relationship with

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.720
Jehovah.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:54.519
With good reason, the footnote to 1 Corinthians chapter 15 verse 33 warns us, bad associations

00:04:54.519 --> 00:04:58.199
corrupt good morals.

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:03.800
Cultivating friendships with people who do not serve Jehovah is like trying to mix oil

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.480
with water.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.920
It just doesn't work.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.519
Why not?

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:18.389
Because the scriptures teach that true friends can be found only among Jehovah's people.

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:24.149
Our Christian Brotherhood is the only place where we can find friends like the one described

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:27.750
at Proverbs chapter 18 verse 24.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:34.750
Please open to that scripture, and notice the distinction between a companion and a true

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.069
friend.

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:40.189
Proverbs chapter 18 verse 24 reads,

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:46.550
There are companions ready to crush one another, but there is a friend who sticks closer

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.389
than a brother.

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:55.430
Our Christian brothers and sisters are not simply companions or acquaintances, someone

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.709
we happen to know.

00:05:57.709 --> 00:06:00.430
They are loyal friends.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.310
We can rely on them.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.949
Why?

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:06.310
Is it because we're all the same age?

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:11.470
Is it because we come from the same national, economic or social background?

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.110
No.

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:18.629
Our friends in the Christian congregation stick closer than a brother because they share

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:26.269
our faith, our values, our love for Jehovah and our hopes.

00:06:26.269 --> 00:06:29.589
They work with us side by side in the ministry.

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:34.389
They support us when we're discouraged or when we're facing a trial.

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:40.189
They rejoice with us when we have good times together in Jehovah's service.

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:45.470
And the true friendships that we enjoy now in the Christian congregation are going to

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.470
last forever.

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:52.069
Do you remember the brother having lunch with his workmates?

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:59.110
In the following dramatization, watch his face closely and notice how having true friends

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:11.740
affected his joy.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.180
I was so glad I had taken a day off from work.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:30.759
How long had it been since Lisa and I got to spend a whole day together in midweek service?

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:39.870
Lisa started a Bible study and we got to share our day with good friends.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:59.009
People like Sam and Chloe, they've really been there for us through the ups and downs.

00:07:59.009 --> 00:08:00.769
Is that you?

00:08:00.769 --> 00:08:05.050
What are you doing over there?

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:07.410
Did you guys know about this?

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:23.009
I don't know where we'd be if Jehovah hadn't helped us to keep our priorities straight.

00:08:23.009 --> 00:08:36.629
Keeping our life simple, having a clean conscience, staying focused on work that has real meaning.

00:08:37.629 --> 00:08:45.559
And having real friends.

00:08:45.559 --> 00:08:50.759
What more can you ask for?

00:08:50.759 --> 00:08:57.039
Isn't that the way we feel after we spend time with our true friends in the congregation?

00:08:57.039 --> 00:09:04.519
What is it about our brothers and sisters that makes those friendships so special, so precious?

00:09:04.519 --> 00:09:08.519
Why do those friendships bring us so much joy?

00:09:08.519 --> 00:09:13.399
Because our friendship is based on a solid foundation.

00:09:13.399 --> 00:09:18.840
Even when we meet a fellow witness for the first time, we already know a lot about each other.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.320
Think about all the things we share in common.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.639
We worship the only true God, Jehovah.

00:09:25.639 --> 00:09:29.639
We speak the same pure language of truth.

00:09:29.639 --> 00:09:38.200
We adhere to Jehovah's high moral standards, and we have the same hope for the future.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:48.360
These things are the foundation of a relationship built on confidence and trust, a true friendship.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:55.279
What a contrast to people who do not know Jehovah, whether their friendships are formed online

00:09:55.279 --> 00:09:59.240
at work at school or in the neighborhood.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:03.960
Friendships in the world are often based on shared interest.

00:10:04.039 --> 00:10:10.840
However, true friendships are based on common values.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:16.039
Please open to Proverbs 17, verse 17.

00:10:16.039 --> 00:10:23.720
And notice the kind of friendships we will enjoy when they are based on spiritual values.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:27.399
Proverbs 17, verse 17.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:36.679
A true friend shows love at all times, and is a brother who is born for times of distress.

00:10:36.679 --> 00:10:45.480
True friends support one another physically, emotionally, and spiritually, and our true friendships

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:51.340
make a valuable contribution to our joy.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:56.779
People everywhere want to be happy, but many fail to find true joy

00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:00.460
because they are looking in the wrong place.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:07.659
As we have discussed in this symposium, the world claims that we can be happy if we pursue wealth,

00:11:07.659 --> 00:11:13.740
if we engage in sinful conduct, if we adopt extreme views of work,

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:18.779
or if we cultivate friendships anywhere we can find them.

00:11:18.779 --> 00:11:26.379
Such assertions originate with the ruler of the world, the father of the lie, Satan the devil.

00:11:26.379 --> 00:11:31.740
If we look for happiness in Satan's world, we are going to be disappointed.

00:11:33.019 --> 00:11:40.779
In contrast, this first symposium of our always-rejoice convention has identified four factors

00:11:40.779 --> 00:11:47.259
that contribute to our lasting joy. God's word teaches us that joy comes from

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:52.860
first, living a simple life, second having a clean conscience,

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:59.580
third doing meaningful work, and fourth having true friendships.

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:05.580
Our loving father Jehovah knows what makes us truly happy,

00:12:06.299 --> 00:12:15.820
so may we continue to follow his sound advice. If we do, we will find a abundant joy that lasts forever.
