00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:22.820

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.989

Commit your way to Jehovah.

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:17.329
If we carefully rely on Jehovah, Jehovah will act in our behalf.

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:26.180
Part of being strong to us is learning to wait on Jehovah.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.500
He'll do the rest. He always does.
