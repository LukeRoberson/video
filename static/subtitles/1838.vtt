00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:07.759
Everything was going fine in my marriage, also I thought.

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:19.469
My ex-husband was this fellowship, left home, and in less than a month, we divorced.

00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:29.339
Right after the divorce, I had to figure out how I would provide for the girls, and so

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:32.740
I began working as a cleaner.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:41.719
I also had to provide for them spiritually, but many times, because of discouragement

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:49.060
and tiredness, I couldn't be there for them as much as they needed me to be.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.579
Besides all of this, I also had to deal with very negative feelings.

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:05.609
It was a very difficult time in my life.

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:15.159
I had never been so sick, I couldn't even get up to go to the hospital.

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.439
To cope with this problem, I just kept praying.

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:26.859
I was not able to walk, and I was not able to get to the meetings.

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:34.780
The elders realized that I was missing from the meetings.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.159
The elders quickly came to my aid.

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:49.040
I remember that one of the things that touched me the most, was when the elders read a scripture.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:56.760
Some under the thirty-nine verse three, you observe me when I travel and when I lie down.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.400
You are familiar with all my ways.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.239
I realized that I am precious to Jehovah.

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:06.799
It was as if Jehovah was healing me.

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:12.400
I now knew that Jehovah was interested in me and that he was looking after me.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.319
He was making sure that I knew it.

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.680
Something else that I remember fondly was after a meeting at the Kinamo.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.240
One of the elders gave me some scriptures to read at home and said that if we needed

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:33.319
any help, the elders were there for us.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:42.569
Two elders lovingly came to see me because Jehovah uses them as shepherds.

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:48.169
I live very far from the Kingdom home, but the brothers made the sacrifice to get public transport,

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:55.289
get off at the main road, and from there, they walked forty minutes to reach my house.

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:58.330
I don't know what I would have done.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.490
When the elders arrived, they listened to me.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:08.759
They cried with me and they read the Bible with me.

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:11.879
Jehovah loves me.

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:18.139
When I started to feel better, I went back to the group.

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:26.340
I was really happy to be back with my brothers.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.900
Now, after all the help we have received, we are doing well.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:37.639
The congregation is our second home and we feel very good there.

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:44.360
Everything I have today, I owe to the brothers and sisters, especially the elders.

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:53.400
I see shepherding calls as a very evident way in which Jehovah demonstrates his full love for us.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.599
I understand at times that these visits might be a challenge for the elders,

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.319
but the results are really good.

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:07.800
Without a doubt, they can see that all the work and all the effort is worthwhile.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.479
I will never forget the help I received from the elders.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.800
This situation taught me that Jehovah will not let his sheep get lost,

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.560
not even one.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.360
Jeremiah 23 verse 4 says,

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.600
And I will raise up over them shepherds, who will really shepherd them.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.959
They will no longer be afraid or be terrified,

00:04:27.959 --> 00:04:29.639
and none will be missing.

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.160
Declare is Jehovah.
