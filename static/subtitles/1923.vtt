00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.700
Welcome to our program.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:08.619
To begin, here are a few updates about our relief efforts following a number of major

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:12.859
disasters that have affected our brothers and sisters.

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:19.300
In early January 2025, wildfires erupted in Southern California, United States, and displaced

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.940
over 1,100 publishers.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:29.859
As of January 23, the wildfires have destroyed 91 homes of our brothers and damaged 48

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:31.100
more.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.939
A disaster relief committee has been appointed to coordinate the relief efforts, and local

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:40.460
elders and circuit overseers are shepherding those affected and assisting with practical

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.619
needs.

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:48.340
In recent months, Cuba has faced not only hurricanes, but also earthquakes.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:54.299
These disasters damaged or destroyed nearly 500 homes of our brothers.

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:59.780
The Cuba branch has appointed disaster relief committees to coordinate the response.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.340
The brothers are providing humanitarian aid and needed items, as well as repairing homes.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:13.500
On the island of Mayot, located off the coast of eastern Africa, there are some 130 publishers.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.700
These brothers and sisters have been dealing with various crises, including water shortages,

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.219
inflation, and unrest.

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:28.620
Then, in December 2024, Cyclone Chido struck the island, damaging roads, power lines,

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.019
and communications.

00:01:30.019 --> 00:01:35.939
The Cyclone also damaged or destroyed 36 homes of our brothers, and heavily damaged the

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.420
two kingdom halls on the island.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.700
The France branch is coordinating relief efforts.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.340
On December 26, a team of eight brothers and sisters, including the circuit overseer

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.299
and a witness doctor, arrived in Mayot, with essential supplies for our brothers.

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:59.980
Sadly, though, on January 13, 2025, Mayot was struck again, this time by a tropical

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:01.620
storm.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.819
Mozambique was also affected by Cyclone Chido in December.

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:10.659
The Cyclone damaged or destroyed 28 homes of our brothers, as well as two of our meeting

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:11.860
places.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.659
At the same time, various parts of the country have been facing severe droughts and unrest.

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:23.979
Please continue to pray for our brothers and sisters in these areas and many other places

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:27.460
as they contend with various disasters.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.979
We appreciate the hard work of the local branches, as well as all of you dear brothers and sisters

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:35.500
who are supporting the relief efforts.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.699
Thank you for your generous donations to the World Wide Work, which allow us to help

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:44.819
our brothers and sisters during these times of need.

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:51.460
On December 6, 2024, a court in Russia sentenced four of our sisters to forced labor for

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.460
extremist behavior.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.819
What was this so-called extremist behavior?

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.780
Peacefully meeting together to discuss the Bible.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.500
These sisters were all given sentences of more than two years.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.219
They are, however, appealing the decision.

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:13.900
These sentences are the culmination of over six years of criminal prosecution of these

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.939
Christian families.

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:23.280
The husbands of three of these sisters are already serving unjust prison sentences.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:30.919
On December 18, 2024, in Turkmenistan, 21-year-old brother Arslan Vepayev was sentenced to two

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:37.680
years in prison because of his personal consciences objection to military service.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:45.400
On January 8, 2025, an appeals court of held Arslan's criminal conviction but amended

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.240
his sentence to two years of correctional labor.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.199
Yes, we're pleased to inform you that Arslan was released from prison and welcomed home

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:57.000
by his family.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.520
In Eritrea, you'll recall that 23 brothers and sisters were arrested while meeting together

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.000
in September 2024.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.400
This included Sister Misa and Gabriel Jesus, who was 82 years old.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:18.319
We are pleased to inform you that on January 15, 2025, Sister Misa was released from prison.

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:22.079
She's now receiving the medical care she needs.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:27.360
As reported in our last update, Sister Saurang Geburu was released from prison on December

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.560
7, 2024.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:36.879
We're happy to report that she's since given birth and she and her daughter are doing well.

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:42.519
Please continue to pray for these dear brothers and sisters as well as the over 235 others

00:04:42.519 --> 00:04:47.480
around the world who are currently imprisoned for their faith.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:55.160
Despite disasters and persecution, Jehovah's organization continues to move forward.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:01.639
It's a second Timothy 4.5 says, you though, keep your senses in all things.

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:03.279
Endure hardship.

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:08.920
Do the work of an evangelizer fully accomplish your ministry.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.720
Paul's words to Timothy encourage us to endure the hardships of the last days, but we

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.560
remain focused on fully accomplishing our ministry.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:24.360
With this in mind, here are a few recent initiatives that help us to do just that.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:30.120
Around the world, classes of the 2025 Kingdom Ministry School are being held.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.519
This school provides further training to circuit overseers, elders, and ministerial servants.

00:05:35.519 --> 00:05:40.639
The objective of the school is to enhance the brothers' abilities as shepherds and help

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:45.759
them further imitate Jehovah in caring for the congregation.

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:50.560
As a special feature of this year's school, the baptized wives of elders and ministerial

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:57.279
servants have been invited to attend the final two talks along with their husbands.

00:05:57.279 --> 00:06:01.519
Another blessing for Jehovah's people is a new series of seminars designed to train

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:06.040
hospital information departments located branch offices around the world.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:12.120
In turn, these branch offices will provide training to their local hospital liaison committees.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:18.120
The seminar will help these brothers become even more skillful in providing comfort and

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.480
in assisting brothers and sisters to obtain high quality medical care when facing issues

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.199
involving blood.

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:31.000
We're grateful for the hard work of more than 50,000 brothers Earthwide who serve on hospital

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
liaison committees or patient visitation groups.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.040
One thing we can all enjoy is a recent enhancement to our JW Library app.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.319
This enhancement will make it easier to use the study-paying features in the Bible.

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:46.639
How does it work?

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:48.879
Let's watch.

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:54.600
In a recent update to JW Library, some new features were added to help with doing research

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.800
in the Bible.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:01.600
For example, in Luke chapter 2, the study-paying initially shows all the study content for

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.319
the entire chapter.

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:08.279
This is good for getting an overview of everything that is available for a chapter.

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:12.959
If you want to focus on a single verse, tap on the verse, then tap the gem button to see

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:15.680
study content for that verse.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:21.360
The study-paying displays your own personal notes first, followed by the study Bible notes

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:27.120
and pictures, video excerpts, then the marginal references and footnotes.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.759
Additionally, the research guide references are listed individually.

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:36.639
This gives an overview of the available references, which can be useful when you already know

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:39.439
the type of information you're looking for.

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:43.839
Is it a point from one of the article series, or personal application from a watchtower

00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:49.600
study article, or perhaps information from insight on the scriptures?

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:54.120
The research guide includes references all the way back to 1986.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:58.879
So whenever you do research, start with the most recent references to ensure that you

00:07:58.879 --> 00:08:03.040
have up to date and accurate information.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:08.040
Use the study-paying to enhance your personal Bible reading and to help you prepare to

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:11.360
comment at meetings.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.959
We're grateful for these helpful study tools and for the many ways that Jehovah is helping

00:08:15.959 --> 00:08:20.920
us fully accomplish our ministry.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:26.360
Another excellent tool we have is the brochure Love People Make Disciples.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:30.120
This brochure has helped us become more effective in the ministry.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:34.919
It teaches us how to show personal interest in others and to be adaptable, which can

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:38.519
help us to start conversations.

00:08:38.519 --> 00:08:44.000
Why is learning how to start a conversation so important?

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.960
Because we want so much to help people to become disciples of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:53.840
We want to teach them about our wonderful God, Jehovah.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:58.879
But with our new approach, have you ever felt that you just aren't sure what you should

00:08:58.879 --> 00:09:02.240
say to begin a conversation?

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:06.440
Maybe there's even more the case when we're going door to door.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.279
What can help us to have something meaningful to say?

00:09:10.279 --> 00:09:15.919
The Love People brochure has an excellent appendix called Truths We Love to Teach.

00:09:15.919 --> 00:09:18.559
These are the basic truths that we all know and love.

00:09:18.559 --> 00:09:22.360
For example, God has a name.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:28.120
God cares about your suffering and our dead loved ones will be resurrected.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:32.840
How can we use these truths to start conversations?

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.759
Note what the appendix mentions.

00:09:34.759 --> 00:09:44.399
It says, try introducing a truth by asking, did you know that or have you ever heard that

00:09:44.399 --> 00:09:48.200
then use the related scriptures to explain that truth?

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.360
So how would you do that?

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.000
Well, here's an example.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
In some places, after introducing ourselves, we could open up a conversation by saying to

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.799
a person at the door, have you ever heard that God has a name and then share the scriptures

00:10:01.799 --> 00:10:04.639
listed under the truth that we love to teach?

00:10:04.639 --> 00:10:08.440
So that's the basic method we could use.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:12.919
But of course, we need to consider the person we're speaking to and then choose the truth

00:10:12.919 --> 00:10:16.720
that we think would most interest them.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:22.000
The appendix lists 34 of these truths we love to teach.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.399
To be effective, I think you'd agree that we need to spend time learning each of these

00:10:25.399 --> 00:10:29.480
truths and the scriptures that support them.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:34.039
If we have them well in mind, then we're well prepared with something meaningful from

00:10:34.039 --> 00:10:37.799
the Bible to share with all those who we meet.

00:10:37.799 --> 00:10:42.000
So how might we work at learning these truths?

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.159
Perhaps we can make it a family project.

00:10:44.159 --> 00:10:47.000
After all, our children need to learn these truths, too.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.679
That way they can learn to defend their faith.

00:10:50.679 --> 00:10:54.000
Would you like to see how a family might do this?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Very good.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.840
You remember the scripture from last week.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.000
Okay.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.960
Our goal is to learn all of these.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:07.240
So let's add another truth we love to teach.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:12.240
Which scriptures show that God has a name?

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.240
Ophelia?

00:11:13.399 --> 00:11:19.860
Psalm 83.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:20.860
That's okay.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:23.179
You can use the brochure.

00:11:23.179 --> 00:11:26.019
Look here under the heading, God.

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:27.019
18.

00:11:27.019 --> 00:11:30.259
I know Psalm 83, 18.

00:11:30.259 --> 00:11:32.059
Yeah, very good.

00:11:32.059 --> 00:11:35.059
Now what does it say?

00:11:35.059 --> 00:11:42.700
May people know that you, whose name is Jehovah,

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:49.019
you alone are the most high over all the earth.

00:11:49.019 --> 00:11:50.340
Excellent.

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:55.779
You did very well in emphasizing the key points from that scripture.

00:11:55.779 --> 00:11:56.620
Alba?

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.100
There's also Jeremiah 10, 10.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.460
Very good.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:04.620
What's the key phrase from that verse that teaches us the truth?

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:08.259
It says, Jehovah is truly God.

00:12:08.259 --> 00:12:09.340
You got it.

00:12:09.379 --> 00:12:13.139
Now girls, how can we use these scriptures

00:12:13.139 --> 00:12:15.259
to teach this truth?

00:12:15.259 --> 00:12:16.259
God has a name.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.179
Alba, what are you thinking?

00:12:19.179 --> 00:12:20.779
I could ask the person,

00:12:20.779 --> 00:12:23.659
have you ever heard that God has a name?

00:12:23.659 --> 00:12:25.220
That's perfect.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.059
And then what could you do?

00:12:27.059 --> 00:12:29.860
I could show them Psalm 83, 18.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:31.220
Great job.

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:35.179
You girls are doing so well at learning the truth

00:12:35.179 --> 00:12:38.980
that we love to teach and the scriptures that go with them.

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:45.379
I think all of us, young and not so young,

00:12:45.379 --> 00:12:47.019
would enjoy that.

00:12:47.019 --> 00:12:49.940
Why not try it one more together with our friends?

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:52.899
The point is, the more we can learn these truths

00:12:52.899 --> 00:12:54.940
and practice using them,

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:58.500
the more effective we'll be in starting simple conversations

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.620
and teaching Bible truths.

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:03.539
Something else we can do to prepare for the ministry

00:13:03.539 --> 00:13:07.259
is highlighted in lesson one of the love people brochure.

00:13:07.259 --> 00:13:10.340
Point three encourages us to think about what's on the minds

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:11.940
of people in the community.

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:14.100
For example, we could ask ourselves,

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.620
what is in the news?

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:19.379
Or what are my neighbors, coworkers, or classmates

00:13:19.379 --> 00:13:20.820
talking about?

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:22.940
Then we can ask ourselves,

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:27.179
which one of these truths would fit that situation?

00:13:27.179 --> 00:13:30.139
Being adaptable, we imitate the Apostle Paul's approach

00:13:30.139 --> 00:13:31.340
to the ministry.

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.820
You'll recall that at 1 Corinthians chapter 9,

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:36.139
verses 22 and 23, he said,

00:13:36.179 --> 00:13:40.740
I have become all things to people of all sorts

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:45.740
so that I might, by all possible means, save some.

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:48.580
But I do all things for the sake of the good news

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.539
in order to share it with others.

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:54.139
And that's our goal too,

00:13:54.139 --> 00:13:57.340
to start conversations with people using topics

00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:59.059
that will interest them.

00:13:59.059 --> 00:14:04.059
In that way, we become all things to people of all sorts

00:14:04.059 --> 00:14:09.860
so that we might, by all possible means, save some.

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:13.299
May Jehovah continue to bless all of us

00:14:13.299 --> 00:14:15.299
as we support one another

00:14:15.299 --> 00:14:19.539
and we work shoulder to shoulder in his service.

00:14:19.539 --> 00:14:24.179
Dear brothers and sisters, we love you all very much.

00:14:24.179 --> 00:14:27.059
From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:14:27.059 --> 00:14:29.500
this is J.W. Broadcasting.
