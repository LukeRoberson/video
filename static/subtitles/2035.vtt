00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.780
An introduction to the book of Deuteronomy.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:12.779
Deuteronomy was written by Moses on the Plains of Moab in 1473 BCE,

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:16.780
just before the Israelites entered the Promised Land.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.780
The name Deuteronomy means second law, or repetition of the law.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.780
However, the book is also an explanation of the law.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:33.780
Deuteronomy urges the Israelites to love and obey Jehovah in the land he is about to give them.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:41.780
The book consists primarily of four discourses, a song and a blessing by Moses.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:49.780
In the first discourse found in chapters 1-4, Moses reviews Israel's history after the Exodus

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.780
and urges the people to remember what Jehovah has done for them.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.780
For example, Moses reminds them that Jehovah eliminated the faithless and cowardly generation

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.780
that 40 years earlier feared the inhabitants of Canaan.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:14.780
In the second discourse contained in chapters 5-26, Moses exhorts the people to obey God's commandments,

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.780
not out of near duty, but because they love Him with all their heart, soul and strength.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:30.219
Did you know? In the ancient world, foreigners often had no legal rights

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:35.219
and widows and fatherless children faced many difficulties.

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:45.219
In Israel, however, Jehovah's law applied to and benefited all, including foreigners, widows and fatherless children.

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:51.219
Jehovah loves these individuals and his people should love them too.

00:01:51.219 --> 00:02:00.170
In chapter 7, Moses tells the Israelites that Jehovah will clear away the nations in the promised land,

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.170
which are more populous and mightier than Israel.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:14.169
In chapter 8, Moses describes Israel's inheritance as a good land, with streams of water, wheat, barley,

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:22.169
grapevines, fig trees, pomegranates, olive oil and honey.

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:26.169
But it is a land filled with false worship.

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:32.169
So in chapter 12, the Israelites are commanded to pull down the altars to false gods,

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:40.169
to shatter the sacred pillars, to burn the sacred poles, and to cut down the graven images.

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:48.169
In chapter 16, Moses reminds God's people to celebrate the Passover, as well as the three great festivals.

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:55.169
The festival of unleavened bread, the festival of weeks, and the festival of booths.

00:02:55.169 --> 00:03:00.169
Chapter 18 contains a prophecy about a future great prophet.

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:08.169
Moses says, Jehovah, your God will raise up for you from among your brothers a prophet like me.

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:11.169
You must listen to him.

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:22.169
The third discourse in chapter 27 and 28 sets out the cursings for disobedience and the blessings for obedience.

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:28.169
After the nation crosses the Jordan River, the cursings are to be recited on Mount Ebel,

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:31.169
where half of the tribes are to stand.

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:37.169
The other tribes are to stand on Mount Gharism and bless the people.

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:44.169
Chapters 29 and 30 contain Moses' fourth discourse, in which he makes a covenant with the people,

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:49.169
telling them to choose life by obeying Jehovah.

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:55.169
In chapter 31, Jehovah commissions Joshua as Moses' successor.

00:03:55.169 --> 00:04:02.169
Joshua should be courageous and strong as he leads the nation into its God-given land.

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:13.169
Chapter 32 records the song of Moses, which powerfully extolls God's faithfulness in contrast with the Israelites' unfaithfulness.

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:20.170
In chapter 33, we read the blessing that Moses pronounced on the Israelites before his death.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:26.170
In the final chapter, Moses ascends Mount Nebo where he has shown the promised land.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:34.170
Jehovah says, I have let you see it with your own eyes, but you will not cross over there.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:42.170
Moses then dies at 120 years of age, and Jehovah buries him in a secret location in Moab.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:50.740
As you read the book of Deuteronomy, see how Jehovah blesses those who love him.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.740
Note how he withholds his blessing from those who disobey him.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:02.740
In discern how the principles behind God's law are reflected in the teachings of Jesus,

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.740
the prophet like Moses, who is also the king of God's kingdom.
