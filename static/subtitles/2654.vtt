Humans have a fascination with flying but for many who fly small aircraft

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:17.019
The smaller the plane

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:20.019
The greater the instability

00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:28.000
Yet the tiny bumblebee is capable of flying with unmatched stability and strong winds

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.020
How to such a small creature?

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.539
I'll fly even the most experienced pilots

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.020
The bee will reduce speed when an encounter's wind turbulence

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.820
Allowing it to focus its energy on correcting its flight path

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.500
Additionally, the bee is more susceptible to flight disruption when the wind blows against it horizontally

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.740
So another key to stability is that it will roll mid-air into the force of the wind

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:05.420
This repositioning allows for better control as the bee can easily adjust to oncoming vertical turbulence

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:11.739
Understanding the bumblebee's innate control system could someday help aeronautical engineers

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.299
Designed small aircraft better suited for stable flight in adverse weather

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.019
In the meantime, scientists still have much to learn before practical application is possible

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:30.780
What do you think? Is the bumblebee's impressive ability to fly in turbulent weather a product of evolution?

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.340
Or was it designed?
