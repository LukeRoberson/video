00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.349
and introduction to the book of Mark.

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:09.349
Mark may have become a follower of Jesus

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.349
when he was a young man living with his mother in Jerusalem.

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.350
In fact, it seems that their home was used as a meeting place

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.350
by the early Christian congregation.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.350
While Mark may have had limited contact with Jesus,

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.350
he enjoyed association with the Apostles Peter and Paul

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.350
as well as Mark's cousin Barnabas.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.350
He had the privilege to assist Paul and Barnabas in the missionary work.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.350
His ministry also took him to such distant places as Babylon and Rome.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.350
Perhaps between the years 60 and 65 CE while in Rome,

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.350
Mark wrote an account of Jesus' life.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.350
This became the third gospel to be circulated among the early Christian congregations.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.350
Although most of Mark's information is also contained in the other gospels,

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.349
he does include some unique details.

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:12.349
For example, it is evident that this book was written with a non-Jewish audience in mind,

00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:14.349
especially the Romans.

00:01:14.349 --> 00:01:17.349
Mark explains Jewish expressions and customs

00:01:17.349 --> 00:01:21.349
that would have been unfamiliar to Romans and other non-Jews.

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:25.349
He may have obtained much of his information from Peter

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:29.349
who was an eyewitness of practically all that Mark recorded.

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:37.349
Peter's eyewitness testimony may be seen in Mark's vivid descriptions of Jesus' activity and feelings.

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:43.349
The book contains 16 chapters and is the shortest of the four gospels.

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:49.349
It covers the time period from 29 to 33 CE.

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:53.349
Chapters 1 to 10 begin with John the baptizer's ministry

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:57.349
and Jesus' baptism in the Jordan River.

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:02.349
Then Mark describes Jesus' exciting three-and-a-half-year ministry.

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:08.349
These chapters recount Jesus' selection of his apostles, many of his miracles,

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.349
and examples of his tender care and concern for people.

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.349
Chapters 11 to 15 outline Jesus' final week of activity,

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.349
leading up to his arrest and execution.

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.759
Did you know?

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:27.759
Mark was likely the young man who ran away,

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:33.169
leaving his garment behind on the night Jesus was arrested.

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:37.169
Finally, chapter 16 shows that three faithful women

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:41.169
are the first to discover that Jesus has been resurrected.

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:48.740
As you read this gospel, note how Jesus demonstrated his power over sickness,

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.740
death, and the forces of nature.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.740
How he showed his tender care and concern for people

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.740
and how he zealously carried out his father's will,

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.740
providing a glimpse of his future rulership as king of God's kingdom.
