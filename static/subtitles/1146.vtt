00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:08.419
As disciple-makers, we are somewhat like a carpenter who has a toolbox, and inside

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:11.660
he has hand tools and he has power tools.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.059
He likes the power tools because they save him a lot of time and energy.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:22.780
He has a power drill that can penetrate hard wood, he has a power sander that can strip

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:29.859
away layers of built-up grime, he has a power nailer that can nail together pieces very

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:31.859
quickly.

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:39.979
Not likewise, we have a teaching toolbox, and inside we have many useful tools, but there's

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:46.060
no question the most powerful tool we have is God's Word.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:54.000
Notice how the Apostle Paul described God's Word in Hebrews chapter 4 and verse 12.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.579
For the Word of God is alive and exerts power and is sharper than any two-edged sword

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:08.219
and purses even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints from the marrow and

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:13.099
is able to discern thoughts and intentions of the heart.

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:18.420
So Paul says it's like a sword that can purge right to the heart.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.659
Now is that important in our disciple-making work?

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:29.340
Yes, because we cannot read hearts, but when we use God's powerful Word, we begin to

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.659
discern whether the person is rightly disposed toward everlasting life, and we can perhaps

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:43.900
help that person, like using the carpenter power tools, why it can penetrate right to

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.819
the heart of a person.

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:52.420
It can strip away what's on the surface and help the person realize what he really is.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.140
It can really nail down the points.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.659
The Apostle Paul realized God's Word was dynamic.

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.180
That's why it's described that way.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.139
It's dynamic because it comes from the living God, Jehovah.

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:14.620
You see, these words are not just words on a page, Jesus said, these are words from

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.699
the mouth of Jehovah.

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:23.819
A brother asked this question, if you were preaching from house to house with Jehovah

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:30.300
himself, would you do all the speaking, or would you allow him to talk?

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:38.659
Yes, when we open the Bible, we are allowing Jehovah to speak, and that is powerful.

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:47.699
The Apostle Paul went to the city of Thessalonica, and he found Gentiles worshipping lifeless idols.

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:49.219
But what happened?

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:54.860
Since Thessalonians 1.9, Paul wrote, these Gentiles had turned away from their lifeless

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.580
idols to serve the true and living God.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.340
How did that happen?

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:07.580
In chapter 2 verse 13, Paul noted, they had received the Word of God, and that Word was

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.740
at work in those believers.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.900
Paul rejoiced with those results.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.539
And we too, one of our greatest joys, is to see how a new disciple allows God's Word

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:24.539
to work in him, and he makes big changes.

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:51.879
In the following dramatization, notice how Nida unleashes the power of God's Word.

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:54.639
Yo, so tell me.

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:55.960
Hi, again.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.599
You're really quite stealthy.

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:01.599
Brilliant, right?

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:07.960
Perfect when I'm late for class, which is always right.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:17.560
So last week, you spoke about promises, and I'm not about church, but I am about promises.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.560
So?

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.560
Okay.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.959
Well, if these are God's promises, wouldn't it make sense to go to His Word to find out

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:24.959
how to enjoy them?

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:25.959
Seems right.

00:04:25.959 --> 00:04:26.959
Okay.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.079
This is John 173.

00:04:31.079 --> 00:04:36.050
Would you like to read it?

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.290
Um, out loud.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.290
Really?

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.529
Then you know what it says.

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:47.370
I do, but it's nice to hear it again.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.529
This means everlasting life.

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:58.370
They're coming to know you, the only true God, and the one who you sent of Jesus Christ.

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:02.689
So based on this, what means everlasting life?

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:08.170
Getting to know God, but how can you get to know something?

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.810
You're not even sure it exists.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.089
Would you like to explore that answer next time you come by?

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:17.689
Who said anything about next time?

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:20.370
Oh, I'm just wondering if you work.

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:28.069
See you later.

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:32.870
Did you see how Nida unleashed the power of God's Word?

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.629
He asked a simple question that led to reading John 173.

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:41.990
And this is a simple, but powerful scripture.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.910
Jesus was the most skillful disciple maker.

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.870
He basis teaching completely on God's Word.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.189
And when it was possible, he actually read from the scriptures.

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:59.230
For example, you may remember the account in Luke chapter four.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.750
And Jesus went back to his hometown of Nazareth.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:08.269
He entered the synagogue and he read from the scroll of Isaiah.

00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:13.910
This is the prophecy about the anointed one who would preach good news and God's acceptable

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:15.509
year.

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:19.790
But Jesus didn't stop at just reading the scripture.

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.910
He explained its meaning.

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:27.790
He said, today, this scripture that you just heard is fulfilled.

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:33.430
And those towns people could have understood that because he had left the town, left his

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.389
carpentry work months earlier and had begun his ministry.

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:43.189
Likewise, it's not enough for us just to read a scripture.

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:46.189
We must explain its meaning.

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:47.910
And Nida did that.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:53.029
You remember after John 173 was read, she asked this question.

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:58.310
So based on this, what means everlasting life?

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:59.790
And the girl got it.

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:03.550
It means getting to know God.

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.709
What can we do, though, if our listener doesn't get it?

00:07:07.709 --> 00:07:14.110
Well, we can just reread the keywords in that verse.

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:19.990
Also friends, we must be careful not to assume that people understand the terms we come

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:21.189
in the use.

00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:24.029
For example, we often talk about the kingdom.

00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:28.990
Well, to our listener, they may be thinking of heaven.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:33.389
They may be thinking it's a condition of one's heart, not a government.

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:36.509
So we have to explain.

00:07:36.509 --> 00:07:41.029
Also be patient as we use God's word.

00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:47.589
Faith in God and appreciation for the scriptures take time to grow.

00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:52.750
And Jesus illustrated this in Mark chapter 4, verse 26.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.949
Let's just read that.

00:07:55.949 --> 00:08:01.470
So he went on to say, in this way, the kingdom of God is just as when a man casts seeds

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:03.110
on the ground.

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:09.629
Yes, like a farmer, when we spread the kingdom message, we're casting seeds.

00:08:09.629 --> 00:08:14.269
But do we expect those seeds to sprout overnight?

00:08:14.269 --> 00:08:19.629
Jesus explains the growth process in verse 28.

00:08:19.629 --> 00:08:24.110
On his own, the ground bears fruit gradually.

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:30.470
First the stalk, then the head, finally the full grain in the head.

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:33.350
So it's a gradual process.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:38.070
The farmer waters and nurtures the seed, but he must wait.

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:42.190
Likewise, we need to be patient disciple makers.

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:48.350
It may take many return visits before we actually start a Bible study.

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:54.789
But on each return visit, let's try to help the person to progressively build faith in

00:08:54.789 --> 00:08:55.789
God's word.

00:08:55.789 --> 00:09:02.590
Here's an example of how we could help a person come to appreciate that the Bible has

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:06.750
practical, up to date advice.

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.070
And Sister does this.

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:13.710
She asks, what would you say is the key to getting along with people?

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:17.830
May I read a proverb from the Bible?

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:25.629
And she reads Proverbs 17-14, which says, beginning a fight is like opening a floodgate before

00:09:25.629 --> 00:09:28.830
the quarrel breaks out, take your leave.

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:34.149
And then she asks, do you think that this advice could help us to get along with others?

00:09:34.149 --> 00:09:37.789
A reasonable person would say yes.

00:09:37.789 --> 00:09:43.590
How can we help a person build faith that the Bible is a book of reliable prophecy?

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:51.549
Well, on one return visit, we could briefly discuss the prophecy in Isaiah 13-20.

00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:57.470
This says that the city of Babylon would never again be inhabited.

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:04.590
Well, 50 miles south of Baghdad, Iraq, are the runes of Babylon.

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:09.190
No one lives there and no one has for centuries.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:14.509
How can we help someone build faith that there exists a creator?

00:10:14.509 --> 00:10:18.309
Simply read Hebrews 3-4.

00:10:18.309 --> 00:10:25.269
Every house is constructed by someone, but the one who constructed all things is God.

00:10:25.309 --> 00:10:32.149
And then we could ask, is someone told you that the house you live in constructed itself?

00:10:32.149 --> 00:10:34.190
Would you believe them?

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:35.789
Obviously not.

00:10:35.789 --> 00:10:41.429
Neither could we really believe that this whole universe constructed itself.

00:10:41.429 --> 00:10:46.350
So brothers and sisters, this is a powerful tool.

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:49.509
Let's unleash its power in our ministry.

00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:56.870
We will become more effective disciple makers, and we will overflow with joy as we see that

00:10:56.870 --> 00:11:01.830
word of God at work in a new believer.

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:06.190
Brother David's Plane, a member of the governing body, will now present the next part of this

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:13.529
symposium, experience the joy of disciple making, improve your skills, illustrating key

00:11:13.529 --> 00:11:14.529
points.
