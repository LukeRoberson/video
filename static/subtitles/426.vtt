00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.070
Jeremiah chapter 2 and verse 13,

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.410
that my people have abandoned me,

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.210
the source of living water,

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.550
and dug for themselves broken sisters

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.910
that cannot hold water.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.509
Now we often may think,

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:16.710
how is it possible that Jehovah's people

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.149
after all they saw, all they experienced

00:00:19.149 --> 00:00:23.190
could leave Jehovah and look for wisdom and support elsewhere?

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.390
And yet it happened over and over again.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.269
Is there a lesson and a warning for us?

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:31.030
Well, yes, there is.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.750
Today we appreciate so much all of the spiritual provisions

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.990
that we're receiving from Jehovah through his organization.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.189
Travel all around the world,

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:41.710
and our brothers and sisters say they have never felt

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.390
closer to Jehovah's organization than they do now.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.189
That we're receiving life-giving waters of truth

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:49.829
as we never have before.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.310
But even so, just as in Jeremiah's time,

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.869
some of our dear brothers and sisters

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:58.390
are leaving Jehovah or have left Jehovah

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.829
in the pure waters of truth and pursued worthless things.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.469
How can that happen?

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:07.349
How do we make sure that does not happen to us?

00:01:07.349 --> 00:01:09.269
Well, did you notice the point in our text comment,

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:11.870
the first two sentences that says this,

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.549
it says, Satan the devil is intent on neutralizing

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.629
the life-giving guidance we receive from Jehovah.

00:01:18.629 --> 00:01:21.430
Moreover, our own treacherous heart

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.469
could interfere with how well we respond

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:26.909
to Jehovah's directives.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.390
Now, when I think of that statement,

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.310
the treacherous heart, how we respond to Jehovah's directives,

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.709
I cannot help but think of Solomon.

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:36.310
Now, we know Solomon's account, how Jehovah blessed him,

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.709
gave him everything he needed to be obedient,

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:43.230
but Solomon ended up losing his precious record with Jehovah.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.790
He abandoned the source of living water.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.870
Now, Solomon started off so well, what happened to him?

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.069
Well, exactly what our text is talking about here today.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.909
He allowed his treacherous heart to interfere

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.430
with Jehovah's directives.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.629
Now, the directives at Jehovah gave Solomon

00:02:00.629 --> 00:02:02.269
were very, very clear.

00:02:02.269 --> 00:02:05.629
Look, for example, in Deuteronomy, chapter 17.

00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:07.269
And as we remember as the king,

00:02:07.269 --> 00:02:09.590
he was supposed to read this law on a regular basis,

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.430
write this law on a regular basis.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.629
Deuteronomy 17, verse 16 and 17.

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.590
He says, however he, in the context,

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.069
is talking about the king should not acquire

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.590
many horses for himself.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.509
Verse 17, neither should he take many whys for himself,

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:29.509
so that his heart may not go astray.

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:32.469
Nor should he acquire vast amounts of silver

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:34.789
and gold for himself.

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:39.229
Do not acquire horses, wives, vast amounts of silver

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:42.189
and gold, Solomon did all three.

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:45.509
You look at Deuteronomy chapter 7 and verse 3.

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:48.669
Their Jehovah says, do not form marriage alliances

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:51.629
with the nations because they will lead you astray.

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.430
What did Solomon do?

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.150
Well, look over to First Kings chapter 11

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.169
and look at verses one through three.

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:01.770
First Kings 11, one through three,

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.370
it says, but King Solomon loved many foreign women

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.650
besides the daughter of Pharaoh, Moabite, Ammonite,

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.050
Edomite, Sidonian and Hittite women.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.689
They were from the nations about whom Jehovah said

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:17.969
to the Israelites, you must not go in among them

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:20.289
and they should not come in among you

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:23.729
for they will surely incline your heart to follow their gods,

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:27.449
but Solomon clung to them and loved them.

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:32.330
And he had 700 wives who were princes and 300 concubines

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.889
and his wives gradually incline his heart,

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:37.889
just as Jehovah said.

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:39.810
Now, how did this happen?

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.689
At Solomon did not just fall into sin.

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:44.650
Solomon just didn't in a moment of weakness,

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.650
he didn't just wake up one day and realize, oh my word,

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.289
I have 700 wives and 300 concubines.

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:52.610
If he did, Solomon had more problems than we thought he did.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.370
No, Solomon was an intelligent man.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.610
This was a man who was blessed by Jehovah with wisdom.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.889
How did he deviate so far?

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:03.370
Well, it was a series of decisions,

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.330
one after another that differed from Jehovah's directives

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.050
that somehow he was able to explain away, rationalize away

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.330
until he was completely alienated from Jehovah.

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.490
Now, we don't know what was going through Solomon's mind

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.250
or how he made those decisions,

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.329
but even from our limited perspective,

00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:25.730
we can see how that could have happened.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.290
Now, for example, he starts off talking

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.490
about the daughter of Pharaoh.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.209
Now, he took the daughter of Pharaoh as a wife,

00:04:31.209 --> 00:04:33.970
but interestingly, in 1 Kings chapter three,

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.569
it relates how Jehovah granted him all the wisdom

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:37.769
and blessed him.

00:04:37.769 --> 00:04:41.370
Well, that was after he had taken the daughter of Pharaoh

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.850
as a wife.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.250
So it was a possible Solomon thought,

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:46.050
you know, Jehovah's still blessed me,

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.930
this must be everything is okay.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.410
Now, Solomon knew something wasn't quite right there

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.009
because in 2 Chronicles chapter eight, in verse 11,

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:54.930
it says he had to build another house for her.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.329
She couldn't live in the house of David

00:04:57.329 --> 00:04:59.009
because of the ark, it was holy.

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:01.769
She was a foreigner and couldn't live there.

00:05:01.769 --> 00:05:03.810
He knew something wasn't quite right,

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.730
but he was able to make the decision

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.970
and rationalize it away anyway.

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:11.769
It says that he loved Moabite women.

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:14.610
As we know, the Moabites were enemies of Jehovah,

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.009
but not all of them.

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:19.209
For example, you may remember that when King David

00:05:19.209 --> 00:05:21.410
was on the run from King Saul,

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.970
he asked the king of Moab

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.290
if he could bring his father and mother,

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.569
David's father and mother there,

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:29.449
and the king of Moab protect them.

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:31.490
And they did so the whole time

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.970
that David was in the stronghold the account says.

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.970
So that means the king of Moab protected Solomon's grandparents.

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.850
We also remember Ruth.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.850
Well, Ruth was Solomon's great-great-grandmother

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.370
and she was a Moabite woman

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.610
and look how well that turned out.

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:54.610
And also men from Moab and Ammon were part of David's mighty men.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.689
So they weren't all bad.

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:59.370
So was it perhaps through David's mighty men

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.050
or maybe from his grandparents who stayed in Moab

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.290
that he was introduced to some of his first wives from Moab?

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.089
It talks about Ammonite women.

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:11.209
Well, we remember Solomon's son, Rhea Bohm,

00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:13.050
who later became King.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.490
He was born from an Ammonite woman.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:20.889
And interestingly, he was born before Solomon became King.

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:23.089
So again, was it possible the Solomon reason?

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:24.290
Well, Jehovah's bless to me.

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.009
I got an Egyptian wife and Ammonite wife.

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:29.730
Maybe this doesn't apply to me like it does everybody else.

00:06:30.649 --> 00:06:32.569
But what about Sidonians?

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:35.850
Well, we know the Sidonians were famous for their craftsmanship.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.930
They had outstanding abilities as loggers and lumbermen.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.930
In fact, David's Solomon's father, David,

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.610
used the Sidonians to bring lumber in great quantity for the temple.

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.050
Solomon later established contracts with the Sidonians

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.769
to cut trees for the temple.

00:06:52.769 --> 00:06:56.250
Well, was it through possibly some of these business relationships

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.649
that he first was introduced to some who became his wise?

00:06:59.649 --> 00:07:01.009
Could he have reasoned that, well, you know,

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:03.050
marrying the Sidonian women?

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.410
Well, that'll help ensure that Jehovah's house

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:06.250
is completed.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.569
This will help me fulfill my Theocratic assignment.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.529
And just one more, what about the Hittite women?

00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:16.730
Well, we remember Euryah.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:20.129
David committed adultery with Bashiba

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:22.529
and had Euryah put to death.

00:07:22.529 --> 00:07:26.410
A Bashiba became Solomon's mother.

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:30.649
Euryah was a Hittite and one of David's mighty men.

00:07:30.649 --> 00:07:33.250
So that means Solomon's mother

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.930
had been married to a Hittite man.

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.649
So was it perhaps through Bashiba,

00:07:38.649 --> 00:07:41.889
through her former in-laws or perhaps through others

00:07:41.889 --> 00:07:44.850
where Solomon was introduced to some of his first wives

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:46.170
from the Hittites?

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:49.410
Now, we don't know what Solomon was thinking.

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:52.529
But we can see how it was possible for him

00:07:52.529 --> 00:07:56.689
to begin to rationalize some of those early decisions

00:07:56.689 --> 00:07:59.449
until he found himself on a slippery slope

00:07:59.449 --> 00:08:02.569
completely alienated from Jehovah.

00:08:02.569 --> 00:08:05.329
So what's the lesson for us?

00:08:05.329 --> 00:08:08.009
Well, we read this account of Solomon,

00:08:08.009 --> 00:08:10.930
accumulating all of those wives, all the riches,

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.370
all of those horses, and it's like watching a car crash

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:14.209
in slow motion.

00:08:14.209 --> 00:08:16.329
We know exactly where it's heading,

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:18.290
but Solomon didn't see it coming.

00:08:19.529 --> 00:08:21.569
So the question we have to ask ourselves is,

00:08:21.569 --> 00:08:23.290
what would the reaction be?

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:28.050
If somebody was reading my life story right now,

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:31.930
the decisions that I am making a day to day right now.

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:36.210
You see, our heart, too, is treacherous.

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:40.450
Our heart will try to cause us to rationalize a way,

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:41.769
Jehovah's clear directive.

00:08:41.769 --> 00:08:44.250
Sometimes we may rationalize a decision

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:47.929
because we see we're still getting blessings from Jehovah.

00:08:47.929 --> 00:08:49.610
Or maybe rationalize a decision

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.970
because we see how it worked out for somebody else

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:57.090
or what somebody else is doing, dangerous.

00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:58.090
So what do we need to do?

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:00.289
Well, we need to do what Solomon said

00:09:00.289 --> 00:09:01.649
and should have done himself.

00:09:01.649 --> 00:09:05.210
If you turn to Proverbs chapter three and verse five,

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:06.570
let's turn there together.

00:09:07.529 --> 00:09:15.799
Proverbs chapter three and verse five,

00:09:15.799 --> 00:09:19.639
is as trust in Jehovah with all your heart

00:09:19.639 --> 00:09:23.720
and do not rely on your own understanding.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.480
Do not rely on your own understanding,

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.559
on our own wisdom, trust in Jehovah,

00:09:28.559 --> 00:09:30.960
follow his direction.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.039
And if we do, we can be assured that we will never abandon

00:09:35.039 --> 00:09:37.000
the source of living water,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.720
but rather will benefit from his guidance for all eternity.
