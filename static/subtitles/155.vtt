WEBVTT

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.799
As Jehovah's Witnesses, we truly love the Bible.

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:08.300
Why?

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.500
Because we know it is God's Word.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.500
That's why we love reading it.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.199
We love studying it.

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.500
And we love learning about its history.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.500
When we pause for a moment

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.500
and reflect on the many efforts

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.800
that have been made through the centuries

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.300
to hinder and even stop the distribution of the Bible,

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.100
it becomes obvious that its author, Jehovah,

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.500
has been personally involved in preserving

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.600
and making known his precious Word.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.399
This is very much in harmony with the thought

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.500
in Isaiah chapter 40 and verse 8.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.399
The green grass dries up, the blossom withers,

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:58.149
but the Word of our God endures forever.

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.850
With that in mind, I'm happy to speak with you this month

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.250
on a theme that's very close to my heart.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.049
The Word of our God endures forever.

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.150
The more we come to appreciate the value of God's Word,

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.750
the more we'll be moved to read it

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.950
and even more important to apply it in our lives.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.950
Jehovah gave us an outstanding gift

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.250
when he inspired faithful men

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.650
to record his precious Word.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.250
It's through the pages of God's Word

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.950
that we learn just how much God loves us.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.549
Thus his Word contains guidance on how to live.

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.450
It outlines his purpose in creating us.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.150
It gives us his precious promises

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.250
for life everlasting in peace and happiness.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.650
No wonder the Apostle Paul was inspired to write

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:02.150
at 2 Timothy chapter 3 and verses 16 and 17.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.250
All Scripture is inspired of God

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.050
and beneficial for teaching, for reproving,

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.349
for setting things straight,

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.050
for disciplining in righteousness

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.949
so that the man of God may be fully competent,

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:23.150
completely equipped for every good work.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.250
Of course, Satan the Devil does not want people

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.250
to have access to these precious truths

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.949
from our Heavenly Father Jehovah.

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:35.349
It's no surprise that there have been many obstacles

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.050
to making the Bible available.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.750
While Satan may not have been directly behind all of these,

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.650
he certainly had made use of them.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.750
What are some of these obstacles?

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.750
And how have they been overcome?

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.949
Let's consider the first obstacle, language barriers.

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:58.650
The first 39 books of the Bible,

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.550
which are often called the Old Testament,

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.550
were written primarily in the Hebrew language.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.949
These books were known by Hebrew-speaking servants of Jehovah.

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:13.750
However, as time went on,

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.050
particularly after the destruction of Babylon,

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.250
many Jews established communities

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.550
and other nations of the earth.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.250
Many of these Jews spoke Greek.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.949
They no longer used Hebrew.

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:30.349
That meant that many Jews no longer had access

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:34.650
to the Scriptures in a language they could understand.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.849
Consider what had happened.

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.650
As Alexander the Great conquered more and more

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.849
of the then-known world,

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.650
Greek gradually became the common language of commerce

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.150
and government throughout his empire.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.449
If the Bible was to be understood by the Jews

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:55.349
and by Jewish proselytes who were scattered

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.949
throughout this vast Greek-speaking territory,

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:03.250
it needed to be translated into Greek.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.050
Beginning about the year 250 BCE,

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.349
the Hebrew Scriptures began to be translated into Greek.

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.250
In time, that Greek translation came to be known

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.649
as the Septuagint.

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:20.250
It was widely and frequently used

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.350
by the Christians in the first century who spoke Greek.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.250
In fact, the writers of the Christian Greek Scriptures,

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.050
which is often called the New Testament,

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.750
frequently quoted directly from that translation.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.149
So that obstacle had been overcome.

00:04:39.149 --> 00:04:43.449
But there were many more language obstacles ahead.

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:46.750
As the Roman Empire began to flourish,

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.250
Latin replaced Greek as a common language.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.949
Now, it was necessary to translate the Bible into Latin.

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:59.750
Some Latin translations of the Bible books began to appear.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.449
But it was in the year 405 CE

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:07.550
that Jerome completed the definitive Latin translation

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.149
of the Bible.

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:13.350
It came to be known as the Latin Vulgate.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.050
Jerome's translation would become the standard Bible

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:23.750
used by Christendom for the next nearly 1,000 years.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.449
However, Latin soon became the language of the learned

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:30.149
and the elite, so the common people

00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:34.649
could no longer understand the Bible's message.

00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:37.550
During that long period,

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.449
there were sincere men that translated portions of the Bible

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:43.649
into some additional languages.

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:49.050
But these translations were, of course, all made by hand.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:54.550
Such handwritten copies of the Bible were rare and expensive.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.550
Therefore, access to the Bible in vernacular

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.850
or common languages was very limited.

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.350
But language was not the only obstacle

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.250
that threatened to prevent the distribution of God's Word.

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.750
Consider a second factor,

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.050
direct opposition to Bible translation

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.149
and distribution from religious leaders.

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:23.250
That opposition started to increase in 1229

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.949
when the local church council of Toulouse decreed.

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:30.850
We prohibit also that the laity

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.050
should be permitted to have the books

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.949
of the old or the New Testament.

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:42.050
In 1234, the council of Taragona decreed

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.949
no one should possess the books of the old

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:48.649
or the New Testament in the vernacular language.

00:06:48.649 --> 00:06:50.949
And if anyone possesses them,

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:54.250
let him deliver them within eight days

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.949
from the promulgation of this decree

00:06:56.949 --> 00:07:02.149
to the local bishop so that they may be burned.

00:07:02.149 --> 00:07:06.250
Thus, during a very long period in history,

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.050
there was limited access to the Bible

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.449
in the languages spoken by common people.

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:15.250
But did that mean that the Word of God

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.250
would not continue to endure?

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.250
Neither language barriers nor opposition

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.949
from religious leaders could stop God's Word

00:07:24.949 --> 00:07:27.149
from being made known.

00:07:27.149 --> 00:07:29.550
Even in those dark times,

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.750
there were individuals who loved God's Word

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.250
and who worked hard to translate it

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.149
and to make it available to others.

00:07:38.149 --> 00:07:41.350
Consider John Wickliffe and his followers

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:44.050
who were called the lawlers.

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.050
John Wickliffe and his associates

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:49.649
completed the translation of the Bible into English

00:07:49.649 --> 00:07:52.850
about the year 1382.

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:56.050
They eagerly hand-copied the translation

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:58.550
and then traveled from village to village

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:01.750
reading the Bible to the common people.

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:05.649
Despite tremendous opposition from the church,

00:08:05.649 --> 00:08:09.449
Wickliffe and his followers made the Bible available

00:08:09.449 --> 00:08:13.350
to many honest-hearted people in the English language.

00:08:14.449 --> 00:08:18.550
After Wickliffe died in 1384,

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:21.649
great opposition came to his followers.

00:08:21.649 --> 00:08:25.149
Many had land and property confiscated.

00:08:25.149 --> 00:08:27.750
Others were burned at the stake.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.550
In response to the work of Wickliffe

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:35.350
and the lawlers, in 1408,

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:41.350
Thomas Airendel, Archbishop of Canterbury, declared,

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:44.649
we therefore decree and ordain

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:49.350
that no man shall hear after by his own authority

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:53.649
translate any text of the scripture into English

00:08:53.649 --> 00:09:00.450
or any other tongue upon pain of greater excommunication.

00:09:00.549 --> 00:09:04.649
Did such opposition wipe out efforts to translate

00:09:04.649 --> 00:09:07.049
and make the Bible available?

00:09:07.049 --> 00:09:09.549
Absolutely not.

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:12.149
The work of Wickliffe and his associates

00:09:12.149 --> 00:09:15.649
stimulated interest in the Bible throughout England

00:09:15.649 --> 00:09:19.250
and even as far as Central Europe.

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:22.850
Religious leaders were not able to silence

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:24.649
the Word of God.

00:09:24.649 --> 00:09:29.649
In fact, within just a few decades after Wickliffe's death,

00:09:29.649 --> 00:09:32.950
two factors led to a tremendous increase

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:35.649
in the availability of the Bible.

00:09:35.649 --> 00:09:39.649
The first, about the year 1454,

00:09:39.649 --> 00:09:43.950
was the development of printing with movable type.

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:47.950
This invention would in time allow for the printing

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:52.450
of large quantities of Bibles in many languages.

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:57.750
The second factor was the compiling and printing

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:01.549
of the Hebrew and Greek original language text

00:10:01.549 --> 00:10:03.649
of the Holy Scriptures.

00:10:03.649 --> 00:10:06.850
This allowed many translators to have access

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:09.450
to the original language texts

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:14.049
so that they then could produce high quality translations

00:10:14.049 --> 00:10:16.350
in their own languages.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.250
What was the result?

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:21.750
In the 1500s across Europe,

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:25.149
fresh translations were made and printed

00:10:25.149 --> 00:10:27.549
in vernacular or common languages

00:10:27.549 --> 00:10:32.549
including German, English, Italian, French, Dutch,

00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:37.649
Czech, Danish, Swedish, Spanish, Slovenian,

00:10:37.649 --> 00:10:39.850
and many others.

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:43.549
However, opposition continued.

00:10:43.549 --> 00:10:46.149
Bible translators were frequently hounded

00:10:46.149 --> 00:10:49.350
by the Inquisition and some translators

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:52.750
like William Tindale and John Rogers

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:55.950
were even put to death for their work.

00:10:56.049 --> 00:11:00.149
Nonetheless, the Word of God continued to endure

00:11:00.149 --> 00:11:05.250
and be made available to more and more language groups.

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:07.750
By the early 1800s,

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:11.049
Bible translation began to speed up.

00:11:11.049 --> 00:11:15.149
Bible societies and intrepid translators began to work

00:11:15.149 --> 00:11:17.450
in many parts of the earth

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:20.450
so that the Bible began to appear in languages

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:22.750
of Asia, Africa,

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.350
the Pacific Islands,

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:28.750
as well as in indigenous languages of the Americas.

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:32.450
From 1800 to 1899,

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:35.149
some portions of the Bible were translated

00:11:35.149 --> 00:11:38.350
into some 400 languages

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:41.250
and from 1900 to 1950,

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:45.850
more than 500 languages were added.

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:47.850
Consider what has been accomplished

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:50.549
with the new world translation.

00:11:50.549 --> 00:11:52.350
As of this month,

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:55.950
the new world translation has been produced in whole

00:11:55.950 --> 00:12:00.450
or in part in 149 languages

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:04.850
with an additional 37 languages approved.

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:08.450
It's obvious that neither language barriers

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:11.250
nor opposition from religious leaders

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:15.549
was able to stop the distribution of God's Word.

00:12:15.549 --> 00:12:19.649
Jehovah has protected it through the ages.

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:24.450
It's just as Psalm 12 and verse 6 and 7 says,

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:28.950
the sayings of Jehovah are pure.

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:32.649
They're like silver refined in an earth and furnace,

00:12:32.649 --> 00:12:35.750
purified seven times.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:38.350
You will guard them, O Jehovah.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:40.950
You will protect each one of them

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:43.549
from this generation forever.

00:12:45.149 --> 00:12:49.250
Yes, Jehovah has protected each one

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:53.250
of his precious sayings down through the ages,

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:56.950
but consider a third obstacle.

00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:00.649
Although the Bible is now available in whole or in part

00:13:00.649 --> 00:13:03.950
in almost 3,000 languages,

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:07.750
many people are no longer interested in reading it.

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:09.649
In our modern age,

00:13:09.649 --> 00:13:14.149
people have become increasingly skeptical and irreligious.

00:13:14.149 --> 00:13:17.250
Scientists have extolled the theory of evolution

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:19.450
and have made it appear intelligent

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:22.549
to adopt the existence of God.

00:13:22.549 --> 00:13:23.950
At the same time,

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:26.750
secular philosophy has encouraged people

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:28.549
to make life decisions

00:13:28.549 --> 00:13:31.549
according to what feels right to them.

00:13:31.549 --> 00:13:33.450
What is the result?

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:36.149
A world where people are often guided

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:39.950
by their own selfish, fleshly desires.

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:42.250
Instead of leading to happiness,

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:46.250
many people are left feeling empty and dissatisfied.

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:50.950
How is this third obstacle overcome?

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:52.850
Around the world.

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:56.450
People are opening God's word the Bible

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:58.750
and reading it for themselves.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:01.649
They're recognizing that its thoughts

00:14:01.649 --> 00:14:04.250
are not simply human wisdom.

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:07.450
As they apply its principles in their lives,

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:10.549
they find contentment and joy.

00:14:10.549 --> 00:14:14.149
They develop self-respect and dignity

00:14:14.149 --> 00:14:17.549
from living according to the upright moral standards

00:14:17.549 --> 00:14:20.149
outlined by our Creator.

00:14:20.149 --> 00:14:26.649
As Psalm 119 verses 97 to 100 state,

00:14:26.649 --> 00:14:29.450
how I do love your law,

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:33.049
I ponder over it all day long.

00:14:33.049 --> 00:14:36.549
Your commandment makes me wiser than my enemies

00:14:36.549 --> 00:14:39.250
because it is with me forever.

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:42.850
I have more insight than all my teachers

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:45.950
because I ponder over your reminders.

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:49.850
I act with more understanding than older men

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:54.350
because I observe your orders.

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:58.250
What a powerful proof that the Word of God

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:02.649
endures forever while the advice of human philosophers

00:15:02.649 --> 00:15:04.850
is frequently flawed.

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:07.950
The Bible's counsel works.

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:09.850
If we apply it,

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:12.549
it can help us either to overcome

00:15:12.549 --> 00:15:18.049
or to cope with any problem or situation that we may face.

00:15:18.049 --> 00:15:19.549
What is more,

00:15:19.549 --> 00:15:23.049
by explaining God's purpose for the future,

00:15:23.049 --> 00:15:25.750
it gives us a solid hope.

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:29.350
This earth will be restored to the paradise

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:32.149
that it was when it was first created.

00:15:32.149 --> 00:15:36.750
It will be filled with peace and righteousness.

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:41.649
What a wonderful gift Jehovah gave us through the Bible.

00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:43.950
Yes, language barriers,

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:46.450
opposition from religious leaders

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:49.950
and even an increasingly irreligious world

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:53.149
cannot stop God's Word.

00:15:53.149 --> 00:15:56.049
How can you be part of the evidence

00:15:56.049 --> 00:15:59.549
that the Word of God endures forever?

00:15:59.549 --> 00:16:01.850
Read it every day.

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:03.350
Study it.

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:06.950
Meditate on the deep thoughts that it contains.

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:12.450
And then apply those priceless teachings in your life.

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:16.450
In this way, not just on the printed page,

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:19.649
not just on the library shelf,

00:16:19.649 --> 00:16:21.549
but in our minds,

00:16:21.549 --> 00:16:23.250
in our own hearts,

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:25.250
in our own lives,

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:30.049
the Word of God will truly endure forever.
