00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:09.619
Welcome to our program. Our focus this month is baptism. How does a person

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:15.859
progress from Bible student to baptize Christian? We'll hear from many who

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:21.699
successfully completed the journey. Sometimes as students gain Bible

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:27.699
knowledge, they realize they need to make a major change in their life. That was

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:33.820
the case with this brother. We'll see how he met the challenge. And our new

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.820
music video beautifully shows the joy experienced by those who dedicate their

00:00:39.820 --> 00:01:06.099
life to Jehovah. This is the March 2020 edition of JW Broadcasting. Imagine for a

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:11.980
moment that you're planning a road trip. You have everything you need, a map, a

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:18.299
car, and plenty of fuel. Before you start the engine though, you need to know

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.019
your destination, wouldn't you agree? If you don't know where you're trying to go,

00:01:23.019 --> 00:01:29.620
you won't know which road to take. The same is true of our ministry, which is in a

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:37.500
sense like that road trip. As Acts 1348 shows, we're always searching for those

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.099
who are rightly disposed for everlasting life. We have everything we need for the

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:49.980
journey, including all the tools in our teaching toolbox. But what would you say

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.939
is our destination. What's the most important goal that we're trying to accomplish

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:05.219
in our ministry? Is it placing literature, directing people to JW.work, making

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:14.939
return visits, starting Bible studies, educating people about the Bible, or making

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:23.539
disciples of Christ Jesus and baptizing them? Each of those goals has value. But which one

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:31.419
is our primary goal? What's the destination that we want to reach? Jesus identified it

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:40.740
at Matthew chapter 28 and verses 19 and 20. There he said, go therefore and make disciples

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:48.259
of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:56.139
and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:05.060
Our destination, then, is a baptized disciple. Each person we meet, each piece of literature

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:13.460
that we place, each time we direct attention to the website, each return visit we make,

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:23.099
each Bible study we conduct. We should have the final goal of making a baptized disciple.

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:32.379
Why is baptism essential? Put simply, it's because baptism is necessary for salvation. That's

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:42.810
what the Bible tells us at 1 Peter chapter 3 and verse 21. Baptism is also now saving

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:50.969
you not by the removing of the filth of the flesh, but by the request of God for a good conscience

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:59.050
through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. So from the time we meet an interested person,

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:06.889
we want to have our eyes on that goal of making a baptized disciple. In fact, the November

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:14.889
1977 kingdom ministry made this statement regarding those we study with. Our discussions

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:23.529
should reflect a genuine personal interest in the student as a potential disciple and therefore

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:32.730
a potential brother or sister in the faith. If we don't have that endpoint of a baptized disciple

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:41.529
fixed firmly in mind, we could end up stuck on side roads. For example, watch this video and see

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:50.540
if you can identify the problem that our brother has. Going out and fill service after lunch?

00:04:50.540 --> 00:05:03.930
Yes, I'm going to be there, but I've got going to visit that guy to make. My neighbor lost his job

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:10.170
after 20 years and as a result, he's got to move out of his house, got to move into an apartment.

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:16.490
Decided to go help him out a little bit to pack up. Make a little easier for him to make that move.

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:23.930
You know, want to be nice a time period where we don't have to worry about economic troubles like that.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:31.209
Yeah, it will. You know, that's why I'm so happy that my grandchildren chose to go for higher education.

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:35.850
They both landed good job on that bridge that you cross when you come here. You've noticed that

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.250
they're starting to do some work on it and that's pretty extensive work. They're going to replace

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.569
that whole bridge. So according to the newspaper article, it's going to be like a six to eight month

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.490
project. That is a long time. Chris, the reason I came by is I wanted to show you this magazine.

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:56.889
I love these. They're so well written. Isaiah 48, 17 is a key scripture here.

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:03.769
Notice what it says, I Jehovah and your God, the one teaching you to benefit yourself.

00:06:05.209 --> 00:06:10.170
That's familiar. I think your dad read that to me once or twice. How's your dad doing anyway?

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:15.769
Doing good? You know, they said they've got more Bible says than they can even cover in one week.

00:06:15.769 --> 00:06:20.649
Well, well, you know, I can remember when you and your dad came here and you were a little kid about

00:06:20.649 --> 00:06:25.290
this high and you just stayed right by our side and your dad was so proud.

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:31.370
You know, Chris, I know my dad had offered to stay the Bible with you in the past.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:40.009
John, to be honest, I'm too old to change. I said in my ways now, I think that God's just

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:46.490
going to have to take me the way I am. Or chocolate. Yeah.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:55.420
Could you identify with the brother in that video? Have you ever had a return visit with someone

00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:01.579
who just loves your company? Perhaps you've been leaving literature with that person for months,

00:07:01.579 --> 00:07:07.259
even years, and yet the person has no genuine interest in progressing.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:16.379
Why is that a problem? Apparently, the person isn't interested in becoming a disciple of Christ Jesus.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:24.699
Our time would be better spent searching for other people who are rightly disposed for ever

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:31.579
lasting life. Of course, that doesn't mean that there's no value in placing literature

00:07:31.579 --> 00:07:39.019
or leaving contact cards that direct people to JW.org. These provisions are part of our teaching

00:07:39.019 --> 00:07:46.379
toolbox for a reason. They can play a vital role in reaching the hearts of those who are

00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:54.379
rightly disposed. So continue to make good use of these tools that Jehovah's Organization provides.

00:07:55.259 --> 00:08:02.779
At the same time, never lose sight of your goal to start Bible studies with interested ones

00:08:02.779 --> 00:08:08.379
and then the ultimate goal to make disciples baptizing them.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:16.540
What about a person you've been studying with for years? But the person isn't making changes,

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:22.379
hasn't stopped going to church and shows no real interest in attending Christian meetings.

00:08:23.259 --> 00:08:29.899
Some people are glad to study the Bible with us simply for the fact that they value Bible education,

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:38.940
and we love to teach people about the Bible. But we have to remember that providing Bible education

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:48.299
for its own sake is not our primary goal. In fact, it could be a side road. The fact is,

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:57.899
some people who value Bible education are not interested in becoming baptized disciples of Jesus.

00:08:58.779 --> 00:09:06.379
The world's full of Bible scholars who are highly educated in the Bible, but who do not become

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:14.779
disciples of Christ Jesus. For example, one Bible scholar was educated at a Bible institute,

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:23.179
a religious college, and a theological seminary. He holds a doctorate in religious studies.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:31.259
He has a thorough knowledge of biblical Greek, and he's written 30 books about the Bible,

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:43.179
yet he describes himself as an agnostic atheist. So just providing Bible education is not our

00:09:43.179 --> 00:09:51.580
primary goal. We want people to build faith in God and to have their own relationship with

00:09:51.580 --> 00:10:02.139
Jehovah that will move them toward the destination of dedication and baptism. That's why it's important

00:10:02.139 --> 00:10:10.220
to honestly analyze the progress of our Bible students. Are they simply taking in knowledge?

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:18.059
Do they prepare in advance for the study? Do they answer in their own words? And from their heart,

00:10:19.259 --> 00:10:26.220
are they making changes in their life to conform to what they've learned? Are they attending

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:34.220
and benefiting from Christian meetings? If not, we may need to follow the advice of the

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:43.580
Kingdom Ministry of October 1988, which stated, if a student is not making meaningful progress

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:52.379
after you've patiently aided him over a reasonable period of time. It may be best to use the time

00:10:52.379 --> 00:11:00.860
to better advantage searching for deserving ones. Depending on the circumstances, it may be wise

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:09.659
to discontinue the study. But why is it so important to be selective about who we spend our time with?

00:11:10.539 --> 00:11:16.460
Isn't conducting an unproductive study better than knocking on doors where no one's home,

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:24.299
or where no one shows interest? To answer that. Let's read Jesus' words at Matthew chapter 10

00:11:24.379 --> 00:11:31.740
verses 11 to 13. Now, when instructing his disciples about how to conduct their ministry,

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:41.100
Jesus said, into whatever city or village you enter, search out who in it is deserving and stay there

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:48.620
until you leave. When you enter the house, greet the household. If the house is deserving,

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:57.899
let the peace you wish it come upon it. But if it is not deserving, let the peace from you return

00:11:57.899 --> 00:12:06.620
upon you. In harmony with those verses, we want to focus our attention on deserving ones,

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:12.860
as Jesus instructed, people who are rightly disposed for everlasting life.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:20.779
Obviously, there is a balance. We need to be patient with those we call on and study with,

00:12:20.779 --> 00:12:28.700
and not everyone progresses at the same rate. But as we call on people and study with them,

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:37.659
we should never lose sight of our goal, our destination, to make disciples baptizing them.

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:45.179
If we have that goal clearly in mind, we'll know when we are moving toward it,

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:51.019
and we'll know when we are getting sidetracked. We could illustrate it like this.

00:12:52.299 --> 00:12:58.620
Think of a plane on a runway. That plane is like a person you've visited,

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:06.220
and you believe shows sincere interest in the Bible's message. Your short term goal at this point

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:14.379
is to get them off the runway and into a Bible study. If you do, that means the plane is taken off.

00:13:15.419 --> 00:13:21.179
But once your study is airborne, you have to keep your sights on your destination.

00:13:22.059 --> 00:13:29.019
You can't just stay in the air indefinitely. Your goal is to make a baptized disciple.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:36.220
If in a reasonable amount of time the student isn't progressing, what will you do?

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:43.179
To keep the study going would be like flying in circles. In the same way,

00:13:43.899 --> 00:13:48.620
a Bible study that simply suspended in the air goes nowhere.

00:13:49.659 --> 00:13:55.259
We have to land the plane either at the destination of a baptized disciple

00:13:56.059 --> 00:14:04.139
or at the termination of the study. But what if something's holding your Bible student back

00:14:04.139 --> 00:14:10.220
from the destination of baptism, maybe an attachment to holiday celebrations,

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:17.980
or an unclean habit like smoking? Notice how this issue arises in the following brief video.

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:24.460
When I started studying the Bible, there were various factors that hindered my study.

00:14:25.019 --> 00:14:30.940
I was a truck driver and I was on the road a lot. I had the worst kind of friendships and I smoked.

00:14:32.059 --> 00:14:38.539
I smoked an average 60 cigarettes a day. I realised that if I was going to make the needed adjustments,

00:14:38.539 --> 00:14:45.580
I had to change my profession. So I changed my job. But if I wanted to get baptized, I had to stop smoking.

00:14:46.779 --> 00:14:53.100
I cut down to two or three cigarettes a day. One day I bought a single cigarette.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:15:03.690
I lit it and I prayed to Jehovah. I begged him to help me and he did help me,

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:09.049
so much so that I never smoked again and to this day I don't even have the urge to smoke.

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:17.610
Ten years after my first Bible study I was baptized. I've been serving Jehovah for 20 years now,

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:19.610
along with my wife and all my children.

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:28.570
Did you notice this man had to pray to Jehovah to get the help he needed to overcome smoking?

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:37.049
In other words, he had to cultivate his own relationship with Jehovah in order to build the faith

00:15:37.049 --> 00:15:45.289
he needed to stop smoking. In the same way, we need to help our students to build their own

00:15:45.289 --> 00:15:53.049
relationship with Jehovah so that they'll also overcome any obstacles that might hold them back

00:15:53.049 --> 00:16:00.490
from progressing to baptism. But what if you're not presently conducting a Bible study?

00:16:01.129 --> 00:16:06.250
What if you've never had the privilege of having one of your Bible students get baptized?

00:16:07.049 --> 00:16:14.330
Does that mean your service to Jehovah is not valuable? Not at all. Remember,

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:22.490
we each do our part in the ministry. Do you remember what the Apostle Paul said at 1 Corinthians 3,

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:33.690
6 and 7? I planted Apollo's water, but God kept making it grow so that neither is the one who

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:43.929
plants anything nor is the one who waters, but God who makes it grow. So never feel that your

00:16:43.929 --> 00:16:51.850
efforts are unimportant. Just as Paul said, what's accomplished in the ministry is a group effort.

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:58.570
When a person reaches baptism, it isn't just because of the effort of the person who conducted

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:06.650
the study. The efforts of others played a role. Perhaps someone else initiated that person's interest

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:14.890
by placing literature or in some other way giving a witness. But remember what Paul said.

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:24.009
Jehovah is the one who makes it grow. He's the one that's drawing to himself those who are

00:17:24.009 --> 00:17:32.650
rightly disposed for everlasting life. What a privilege we have to be fellow workers with

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:41.369
Jehovah as we help people become disciples of Christ Jesus. If we keep that goal clearly in

00:17:41.369 --> 00:17:49.849
mind, how will it help us? We won't be content just to place literature or just to direct interest

00:17:49.849 --> 00:17:57.369
to JW.org. We won't be satisfied just making return visits or starting Bible studies.

00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:07.529
We'll always have in mind our primary destination, making disciples of Christ and baptizing them.

00:18:09.369 --> 00:18:17.049
We of the governing body wish you, Jehovah's rich blessing as you work shoulder to shoulder with us

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:27.720
in helping rightly disposed ones become baptized disciples of Jesus. In our first video,

00:18:28.519 --> 00:18:33.640
we'll hear from several brothers and sisters about how they progress to baptism.

00:18:34.599 --> 00:18:41.000
We'll learn answers to questions commonly asked about baptism. What does it take to qualify?

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:49.880
What does one need to work on? What's the actual day of baptism like? And what blessings can you

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:57.640
expect after baptism? I enjoyed associating with Jehovah's Witnesses. Later, I also started to study

00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:04.039
the Bible. I knew that I had to make drastic changes in my life, but my job prevented me from doing so.

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:15.099
So I asked myself, what would I like to do with my life? I began studying the Bible again with the

00:19:15.099 --> 00:19:19.980
couple. And one month later, started attending meetings regularly.

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:26.779
Since our parents had stopped studying, only three of us went to the meetings.

00:19:28.619 --> 00:19:33.660
Jehovah could do a lot with you. Jehovah can, you know, your whole perspective can change.

00:19:34.299 --> 00:19:38.859
I knew if I applied what I learned, Jehovah would not let me down.

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:46.059
To strengthen my relationship with Jehovah, I read the Bible daily and I pray.

00:19:46.059 --> 00:19:55.259
My relationship with Jehovah has gotten stronger. When I pray now, it feels like I'm talking to my

00:19:55.259 --> 00:20:01.660
close friend. Going on service more, I think it really helped me to draw closer to Jehovah and

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:07.259
making the kingdom feel real to me. And so that's why I wanted to get baptized.

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:15.660
What a great pleasure it was for me when four months later, I could dedicate myself to Jehovah and get

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:25.019
baptized. That made me so happy. Today is a very, very special day for me because today I'm getting

00:20:25.019 --> 00:20:36.740
baptized. At the regional convention, August 9th, 2014, it was a beautiful day.

00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:49.109
Now, when I think about my three children who got baptized today,

00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:55.349
I feel my heart is full of joy and I really thank Jehovah.

00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:01.589
Yeah, it's not a day. I don't go thank Jehovah from taking me out of the darkness.

00:21:04.549 --> 00:21:09.910
If we are determined to be loyal to Jehovah and we have the courage to remain chased,

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:17.990
well, we won't have any regrets. To know that you have a Heavenly Father that cares about you,

00:21:19.349 --> 00:21:30.900
that was the best feeling on earth. I often think, God, is it true? Is it real? Do I really deserve

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:39.859
to have all these blessings? All these blessings have helped me to see that this life provides true

00:21:39.859 --> 00:21:48.740
satisfaction and true happiness. The important quality that Jehovah have told me is love.

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:54.740
I felt that love from my family, from Jehovah, from my friends. I learned that

00:21:54.740 --> 00:22:01.220
we're talking to love people and that's what you're supposed to do. Working closely with Jehovah,

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:08.259
I really feel part of his family. When you give your faith to Jehovah, you're giving your life to him.

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:15.059
He's permitted these things to come up on there. I knew that, but he protected me.

00:22:17.529 --> 00:22:24.009
When I meditate and think about what Jehovah has done for me and Leile, I don't have to be afraid.

00:22:24.009 --> 00:22:28.890
Jehovah is my secure refuge because life's may change, but Jehovah does not change.

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:37.289
Choosing to serve Jehovah was the best decision I have made in my life.

00:22:40.059 --> 00:22:46.859
What beautiful expressions. Did you notice what helps a person qualify for baptism?

00:22:47.819 --> 00:22:55.420
It's studying the Bible, attending meetings, having a share in the ministry, and prayer.

00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:04.140
It was obvious that these brothers and sisters were so happy they had made the decision to get baptized.

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:14.779
For some, the road to baptism takes much effort, but when that day comes, it marks a turning point

00:23:14.779 --> 00:23:18.460
in their life. We'll see that in our next video.

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:37.980
My parents separated, which came as a huge shock to me.

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:42.700
It was devastating, and the consequences just seemed to roll on for decades.

00:23:43.579 --> 00:23:47.579
I would go and start the farm with my father for school holidays,

00:23:48.299 --> 00:23:54.140
but my dad, he abused alcohol and smoked cigarettes and used bad language.

00:23:54.779 --> 00:23:58.700
So by the time I was a teenager, I was doing exactly the same thing.

00:23:59.579 --> 00:24:03.420
In my later teens, I was smoking marijuana every day,

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:08.140
and I was spending up to four nights a week at pubs and clubs and parties.

00:24:09.019 --> 00:24:17.500
I was addicted to alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, and pornography, and I had no power to stop.

00:24:18.539 --> 00:24:23.259
Obviously, it was only a matter of time before that lifestyle affected my health.

00:24:23.259 --> 00:24:28.460
I lost my social skills, and I became depressed.

00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:36.869
The turning point in my life came one afternoon when two of Jehovah's Witnesses knocked on my door.

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:43.910
Because of feeling so lost and so unhappy, I had started to search for answers,

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:46.470
and I'd begun looking at new age teachings.

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:52.859
The timing felt too remarkable to be just coincidence.

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:56.140
I really felt like God wanted me to take the book.

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:00.779
I never looked at new age teachings again.

00:25:00.779 --> 00:25:03.339
I started to read the greatest men book instead.

00:25:05.579 --> 00:25:12.299
A major key for me to be able to make the necessary changes was to cut off bad association.

00:25:13.579 --> 00:25:16.380
I was baptized in March 1994.

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:22.460
When I finally took that step, I felt like I'd started on the right path.

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:27.019
I was so grateful that Jehovah had found me and that he'd drawn me.

00:25:28.859 --> 00:25:32.220
I really fell in love with the thoughts of Psalm 8, verses 3 and 4.

00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:37.819
I Jehovah, when I see your heavens, the works of your fingers,

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:40.700
the moon and the stars that you have prepared.

00:25:41.259 --> 00:25:46.299
What is mortal man that you keep him in mind and the son of earthling man that you take care of him?

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:51.819
I felt so insignificant, and yet Jehovah knew me.

00:25:52.779 --> 00:25:56.779
The hope of everlasting life also really touched my heart,

00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:59.099
and so did Jehovah's forgiveness.

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:04.460
I felt so grateful that Jehovah could forgive me for all of my wrongdoing,

00:26:05.099 --> 00:26:06.460
and that I could have a fresh start.

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:14.220
When we were invited to start circuit work, I had serious doubts about my inadequacies.

00:26:15.099 --> 00:26:17.500
I was not fast at preparing talks.

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:23.579
For me, it always felt like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:29.339
But the very morning, after receiving our assignment to go on the circuit work full time,

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:32.779
my Bible reading was Exodus, chapters 3 and 4,

00:26:33.259 --> 00:26:39.339
where Moses cited his inadequacies to Jehovah that he was not a fluent speaker.

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:44.059
Of course, Jehovah asked him, who is it that assigns a mouth?

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:46.779
It was like Jehovah was saying to me,

00:26:47.579 --> 00:26:49.579
don't worry, I will help you.

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:56.220
To make the changes that I did in life, I'm just so grateful to Jehovah.

00:26:57.019 --> 00:26:59.180
Before I learned the truth, I was lost.

00:27:00.059 --> 00:27:01.259
I didn't know who I was.

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:03.339
I was just a mess.

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:07.819
I wanted to be a man, and I didn't really even know how to do it.

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:11.900
Jehovah has rebuilt me from the ground up.

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:14.619
Jehovah has given me everything.

00:27:25.059 --> 00:27:27.460
We can learn a lot from this experience.

00:27:28.259 --> 00:27:33.539
Some people like Andrew have lives filled with challenging problems.

00:27:34.099 --> 00:27:38.420
Yet by developing a relationship with God, Andrew said,

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:42.819
Jehovah has rebuilt me from the ground up.

00:27:43.779 --> 00:27:48.180
We saw that major changes may be needed to make spiritual progress.

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:52.660
In Andrew's case, he cut off bad association.

00:27:53.619 --> 00:27:59.460
Finally, Andrew's experience shows that baptism isn't the end of the journey.

00:28:00.099 --> 00:28:02.500
He continued to grow spiritually.

00:28:04.019 --> 00:28:07.779
But what if you've been raised as one of Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:28:08.579 --> 00:28:10.819
Are you thinking about getting baptized?

00:28:11.619 --> 00:28:14.339
Have you made baptism your personal goal?

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:21.619
Getting baptized when you're young can lead to a life filled with rich blessings.

00:28:23.059 --> 00:28:28.660
With that in mind, I'm so happy to welcome today a very dear friend of mine,

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:30.900
brother Robert P. Johnson.

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:33.539
RP, welcome to the program.

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:34.900
Thank you, Mark.

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:36.339
I appreciate being here.

00:28:36.339 --> 00:28:43.220
Now, you're here, RP, because you are a wonderful example of someone who has had a life

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:46.180
filled with blessings in Jehovah's service.

00:28:46.819 --> 00:28:50.180
I know that your family goes way back in the truth.

00:28:50.259 --> 00:28:56.339
In fact, I understand that your great grandfather learned the truth in brother Russell's time,

00:28:56.339 --> 00:28:57.779
even before 1914.

00:28:57.779 --> 00:28:58.339
That's right.

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:01.700
So that means you're a fourth generation witness.

00:29:02.819 --> 00:29:07.940
But now, like so many who are watching our program, you were a little boy

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:10.420
growing up in a congregation of Jehovah's people.

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:16.740
So how did you come to the decision that you wanted to dedicate your life to serve Jehovah and

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:17.700
then get baptized?

00:29:18.099 --> 00:29:26.980
Well, Mark, thinking back, I can identify at least two outstanding influences in my life.

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:33.940
And the first was my parents, having that heritage in the truth helped me.

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:37.779
I was just an average kid in my early years.

00:29:38.339 --> 00:29:47.140
But the parents instilled in me a desire to please Jehovah and make it my life to do that.

00:29:47.859 --> 00:29:49.619
They said goals before me.

00:29:49.619 --> 00:29:50.900
They taught me the truth.

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:57.779
I learned enough from them to be able to make a dedication to Jehovah God and to have a close

00:29:57.779 --> 00:30:03.460
relationship with him. And so early on, that's what I did.

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:13.700
I remember that evening, after supper, in my bedroom, praying to Jehovah to accept my dedication.

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:20.339
The date was May 25, 1949. I was 11 years old at the time.

00:30:21.859 --> 00:30:27.859
I told my parents and they were happy, but they just wanted me to wait longer to make sure,

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:32.579
especially how I would handle the teenage years and so on.

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:35.140
So I would.

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:38.980
And so then when did the moment come for you to finally get baptized?

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:50.259
I was at the 1953 International Convention, Yankee Stadium, New York, on July 22, 1953,

00:30:50.259 --> 00:30:54.819
that I was baptized. And again, I remember that like it was yesterday.

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:59.779
When I came up out of the water, I thank Jehovah for that.

00:30:59.779 --> 00:31:03.619
Finally, I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:31:04.259 --> 00:31:09.779
And I also, like a child, added, you can bring the end anytime now.

00:31:12.099 --> 00:31:17.380
So you mentioned your parents the good influence they had on you, but was there another

00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:25.059
influence on you that helped you? Yes. At the 53 Convention, brother Nor had identified that

00:31:25.059 --> 00:31:32.420
there would be a special program for training people in the truth. And from the congregation,

00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:36.500
there was a brother of the anointed named Charles Richardson.

00:31:37.619 --> 00:31:43.380
And my father asked Brother Richardson to train me in this training program.

00:31:44.339 --> 00:31:49.619
And Brother Richardson was a mentor to me for the next five years of my life.

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:56.500
Over the years, he helped me view the ministry as an opportunity to help people

00:31:56.579 --> 00:32:05.140
develop a relationship with Jehovah. And therefore, to reach out to them in teaching them the truth,

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:12.819
the doctrinal truth, but to help them to see Jehovah as a real person. And he helped me to enjoy

00:32:12.819 --> 00:32:19.380
the ministry. That is what has kept me happy in Jehovah's service down to this day.

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:26.099
Now, just from your expressions and what you talked about with me before, I could see that this

00:32:26.099 --> 00:32:33.859
brother Richardson had a tremendous impact on your life. And I think it really made you want to be

00:32:33.859 --> 00:32:39.859
a trainer of other people because that's how I first met you, right? Right. You were the

00:32:39.859 --> 00:32:45.380
brother assigned to be my trainer when I came to the service department. I remember that fondly.

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:50.339
And I know that I'm not the only one. I mean, you've really spent your whole life training other people.

00:32:51.299 --> 00:32:59.940
Well, they spent a privilege. And I was trained. I was helped along the way. I was nobody special,

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:07.619
but Jehovah's extended undeserved kindness to me and made all these things possible. So there's

00:33:07.619 --> 00:33:15.460
no excuse for me not passing along the baton. And it's a delight for me to see others carry it.

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:21.779
So now let's come back. You're 15 years old. You get baptized, Yankee Stadium.

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:28.660
And now as a result of being baptized at this age, how do you feel you were benefited?

00:33:29.299 --> 00:33:38.180
For one thing, you know what you want to do. And you stay focused on it. It makes it easier to deal

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:48.339
with whatever challenge come later. And so being dedicated and baptized early in life helped me

00:33:48.339 --> 00:33:59.380
to stay focused on the truth. I still remember that dedication. It means something to me. And I tried

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:07.460
to make it mean something to others. For as young as they can possibly make it. And they'll find

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:14.739
the same thing I found. Jehovah's blessing will be with them. So now at 15, what doors start to open

00:34:14.739 --> 00:34:21.460
up? What opportunities come to you? Because you are a baptized brother. At age 17, I was appointed as

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:30.500
a ministerial servant. I started pioneering right out of high school at age 18. And served

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:36.739
in where the need was greater. I got a chance to work at starting a new congregation. And so

00:34:36.739 --> 00:34:43.699
at 21, I was a congregation servant or an elder at that point. Then there was a need. The

00:34:43.699 --> 00:34:51.539
organization was looking for brothers who could do traveling work. So at age 25, I had the privilege

00:34:51.539 --> 00:34:58.739
of being a traveling overseer. So now how did you feel? Being elder at 21, being a circuit overseer at

00:34:58.739 --> 00:35:10.260
25 was a little bit overwhelming at such a young age? I was scared. I knew the truth. But I was

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:17.940
uncertain about myself. But then I also know Jehovah would help me. I learned a lot as a young

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:25.300
traveling overseer. And I thanked Jehovah that the people in the circuits that I served

00:35:26.099 --> 00:35:34.820
endured those three years. But now that was the challenges. But what do you see as being the

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:41.699
benefits of having a young traveling overseer? For the congregation, they had somebody who could

00:35:41.699 --> 00:35:50.980
stay out and feel service long hours. And also, the younger traveling overseer could relate to the

00:35:51.940 --> 00:36:00.500
young people and the younger adults in the congregation. There were other benefits that even

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:07.219
today, different ones that I served in earlier circuits, bringing forth to me. For example,

00:36:07.219 --> 00:36:14.420
after having a good time in field service and then the meetings, I would do recreational

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:24.500
things with the kids. And we ran track out in the streets and we played board games, softball,

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:34.420
basketball. And then we had good times just talking about the truth. And also talking about how

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:40.500
you can put your ministry first. And there's plenty of time for seeking a mate later.

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:48.099
So now for a time, you were serving as a single brother. But at some point that changed. When did

00:36:48.099 --> 00:36:56.659
that happen? I have enjoyed the best of two worlds. I enjoyed singleness and the blessings Jehovah

00:36:56.659 --> 00:37:07.780
gave me. But when I was 28 years old, I married a beautiful pioneer sister. And I had already gotten

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:15.219
adjusted in my circuit work. This was my second circuit. So thanks to Jehovah, we were able to

00:37:15.219 --> 00:37:22.900
be married. And to this day, Gracie and I continued in full-time service after 52 years of marriage.

00:37:24.179 --> 00:37:30.340
So RP, you started with circuit work. And then later you went on to district work.

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:35.460
Right. And then you were teaching the Kingdom Ministry school. And then you got invited to

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:43.780
Bethel. Right. And 31 years at Bethel, right? Oh yes. And now you and Gracie, you're doing a

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:52.179
special pioneer work. Right. In Orlando, Florida. So more than 60 years of full-time service to Jehovah.

00:37:53.059 --> 00:38:00.179
It's because of Jehovah's blessing. And it has made me happy. So the question I want to ask you

00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:06.579
is when you're looking back now, these 60 wonderful years, more than 60 wonderful years,

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:13.619
what would you say to young people who are facing the same decision that you face when you

00:38:13.619 --> 00:38:18.739
were a little boy growing up in the truth? It's the best thing I could have done with my life.

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:29.940
And I had many opportunities. Jehovah blessed my humble efforts. As he is blessed,

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:37.300
you and others too. The young people today have even more opportunities because

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:44.420
Jehovah's organization under the leadership of Jesus Christ is expanding and moving fast.

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:50.739
And like Brother Richardson taught me, if you just make yourself available,

00:38:51.539 --> 00:38:59.380
then the organization will find a place for you and use you. And that's so true today.

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:06.260
One of my greatest joys is to see the young people take the baton and run with it.

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:17.539
And I have no regrets. There's been no challenge that overwhelmed me and made me regret things.

00:39:17.539 --> 00:39:22.739
There were challenges, of course. But with Jehovah's help, well, I'm here today.

00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:32.900
And that can be true of our young people. So seize the opportunity while you're young and

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:39.460
experience the blessing that Jehovah gives, those who serve him from youth onward.

00:39:40.659 --> 00:39:47.460
RP, it has been such a wonderful joy to have you here on this program. And to hear about your

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:54.019
life filled with joy, your life filled with blessings, all because of the decision you made,

00:39:54.019 --> 00:40:00.260
just as a little boy, to dedicate your life to Jehovah and get baptized. Thank you so much.

00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:02.659
Thank you. I appreciate talking about it.

00:40:05.099 --> 00:40:11.420
Baptism is always a special feature of our conventions and assemblies. We'll see that

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:17.260
in the following report on the special convention held in Mozambique in 2018.

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:40.230
The Mozambique special convention is truly outstanding for so many different reasons.

00:40:40.789 --> 00:40:45.670
One thing that has made this convention unique is that we have so many courageous brothers

00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:52.389
who have been in prison for their faith from Angola, Korea, Malawi, Zimbabwe, and from some of

00:40:52.389 --> 00:40:58.389
the countries in Europe who had to really stand up and set an example. And to have them all here

00:40:58.469 --> 00:41:03.670
with our courageous Mozambique and brothers has made this convention so special.

00:41:04.949 --> 00:41:10.309
It is very encouraging to be at this special convention. We have spent 10 years in the re-education

00:41:10.309 --> 00:41:15.909
camps along with our brothers from Malawi and we are at the same camp and today we are together

00:41:15.909 --> 00:41:23.349
at this special convention. It's very encouraging. In 1990 I was judged and condemned to 15 months

00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:29.829
of prison in Paris. We were about 100 brothers in prison. They tried to shame us but thanks to

00:41:29.829 --> 00:41:35.670
Jehovah we had courage. Today this beautiful convention fills us with even more courage.

00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:42.389
I was one of the brothers saving us a bicycle career during the ban. Delivering literature

00:41:42.389 --> 00:41:47.909
long distances. It was a difficult way because the police were searching for us. Jehovah blessed

00:41:47.989 --> 00:41:56.659
us with courage, giving us a hard without fear. Because of our Christian neutrality we were

00:41:56.659 --> 00:42:02.980
imprisoned. Although it was a difficult time, Jehovah gave us courage to endure. And now we are

00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:14.199
here together. We really thank Jehovah for that. I was arrested in sentence to six years in prison.

00:42:14.199 --> 00:42:20.360
Despite all these difficulties, today I feel very happy. I feel very encouraged.

00:42:26.539 --> 00:42:30.940
At this convention we released the Greek scriptures in Suah and Senna.

00:42:37.719 --> 00:42:44.840
Thank you very much Jehovah for this wonderful provision. I will surely use it while speaking

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:53.239
upon Jehovah's name in Suah. We are so happy to have this Bible in Suah language. It's easy to

00:42:53.239 --> 00:43:00.199
read and it will improve our family worship. Those are the first two local languages in Mozambique

00:43:00.199 --> 00:43:04.920
to receive any part of the New World Translation. So it was a very exciting day.

00:43:09.559 --> 00:43:18.519
This convention was tied into 18 locations in Mozambique. A total of 1,685 were baptized.

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:27.449
I have faith in Jehovah and want to have a close relationship with them.

00:43:28.409 --> 00:43:34.090
Many have commented on the fact that among the 981 that were baptized in Maputo,

00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:39.369
there were many young ones. And it just shows that the families here in Mozambique are working

00:43:39.369 --> 00:43:45.210
very hard with their young ones to help them to know Jehovah and love Jehovah and to know what

00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:54.519
it means to be courageous. To organize a special convention in Africa requires a lot of work

00:43:54.599 --> 00:44:01.000
and a lot of planning. But you could truly see the blessing of Jehovah here because everything

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:09.559
has gone so beautifully and the delegates are so happy. You can really feel that Jehovah's spirit

00:44:09.559 --> 00:44:22.809
is with us. Before the work was banned in Mozambique, we used to sing to Jehovah. At the camps,

00:44:22.809 --> 00:44:29.610
we continued to sing joyfully. Now with the special convention, we continue to sing to our

00:44:29.610 --> 00:44:37.940
delegates. Many of the delegates commented that their favorite part of the convention was going out

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:44.340
in the ministry with the local brothers. Even though the brothers may have very limited resources,

00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:50.500
they showed them tremendous hospitality. It made a huge impression. Some of the delegates even

00:44:50.579 --> 00:44:55.300
said that when they go back, this is going to have a life-changing effect on them.

00:45:55.369 --> 00:46:04.889
What a joyous occasion. I'll never forget it. And I trust neither will the 1685 brothers and

00:46:04.889 --> 00:46:11.849
sisters who were baptized at that convention. There's nothing like the day you're baptized.

00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:17.130
Our new music video captures this in word and song.

00:47:41.050 --> 00:50:46.380
Beautiful, original song about the thoughts and feelings we each have when we dedicate our life

00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:55.980
to Jehovah. Our program has focused on baptism. We learned that our primary goal in the ministry

00:50:55.980 --> 00:51:04.460
is to help people establish their own relationship with Jehovah that moves them to dedicate their life

00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:13.420
to him and be baptized. We saw that with Jehovah's help, obstacles in the way of baptism can be removed.

00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:19.739
Andrew's experience showed us that baptism can be a turning point in one's life.

00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:27.739
We saw that making the decision to dedicate your life to Jehovah when you're young can lead to a

00:51:27.739 --> 00:51:36.940
lifetime of joy and rich blessings from Jehovah. We heard from many who successfully made the

00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:45.820
journey to baptism and saw the joy and happiness of that special day. Before we close,

00:51:46.539 --> 00:51:53.500
let's visit our brothers and sisters in Angola. The Republic of Angola is on the west coast of

00:51:53.500 --> 00:52:01.820
Africa. This is a beautiful and geographically diverse land. It's home to the breathtaking

00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:09.500
Calendula Falls. The ministry here ranges from the city of Luanda where the territory has worked

00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:20.300
every few days to rugged and remote areas accessible only by walking. Angola's population of

00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:31.139
some 30 million people includes many indigenous tribes and language groups. About 45 percent of

00:52:31.139 --> 00:52:40.500
the population is under the age of 15. Angola has been recovering from a civil war that lasted

00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:53.480
27 years. Despite the challenges, many are embracing the truth. Angola is home to more than 160,000

00:52:53.480 --> 00:53:04.679
Jehovah's Witnesses. They're conducting over 720,000 Bible studies. An average of 25 people

00:53:04.679 --> 00:53:15.239
are baptized every day. 13 congregations are formed every month and an average of 15 new

00:53:15.239 --> 00:53:24.840
circuits every year. This has created a tremendous need for places of worship. Currently, more than

00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:34.360
300 new kingdom halls and 13 new assembly halls are needed. This is the Malweka congregation in

00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:43.239
Luanda. This beautiful kingdom hall was recently completed and is already used by five congregations.

00:53:44.199 --> 00:53:54.380
Our dear brothers and sisters in Angola send you their love and greetings. And brothers and sisters,

00:53:55.420 --> 00:54:04.619
we love you all very much. From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is J.W. Broadcasting.
