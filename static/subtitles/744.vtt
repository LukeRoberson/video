00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:11.539
The Apostle Paul was not a man given to boasting, but on one occasion he felt compelled to boast a little.

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:15.539
And that account is found for us in the book of 2 Corinthians chapter 11.

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:21.539
Please read with me 2 Corinthians chapter 11 and verse 23.

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.359
Are they ministers of Christ?

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.359
I reply like a madman.

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.359
I am more outstandingly one.

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:38.740
What was the subject of Paul's boast?

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.740
Being a minister of Christ.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:47.740
And now being a minister of Christ, what was Paul's focus in this boast?

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.740
He said, I am more outstandingly one.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:01:02.740
William Tyndale, when he translated this verse, he kept the very terseness and the clarity of the Greek when he simply said, I am more.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.180
That's Paul's boast.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.180
What is he focusing on though as a minister of Christ in his boast?

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.180
He said, I have done more work.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:29.180
And now from verses 23 through 27, he gives almost a resume of what happened to him because of the work Paul did as a minister of Christ.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:40.180
Well, how will your properly focusing on your work as a minister of Christ help you to succeed in your assignments?

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.180
Let's consider an example.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.180
And it's found in the book of Luke chapter 8.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:55.400
Luke chapter 8 verses 1 through 3.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:05.400
Shortly afterward, he, this is Christ, traveled from city to city and from village to village, preaching and declaring the good news of the kingdom of God.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:13.400
And the twelve were with him, as were certain women who had been cured of wicked spirits and sicknesses.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.400
Mary, who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had come out.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:33.400
Joanna, the wife of Kusa, herdsman in charge, Susanna, and many other women who were ministering to them from their belongings.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:44.400
A group, Christ, the twelve, and women, women who ministered to the others.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:54.400
What did that mean? Did it mean they cooked the meals, washed the dishes, mended the clothes? Possibly, but not necessarily entirely that.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:07.400
These women ministered to the others by helping them to complete their assignment, as they went on completing their assignment as disciples of Christ.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.400
Notice the backgrounds of these women.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:22.400
Luke mentions three. He says, their women who were cured of wicked spirits and sicknesses, look at Mary. Mary, he says, from whom seven demons had come out.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:29.400
He also mentions Joanna, the wife of Kusa, herdsman in charge, and Susanna.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:38.400
Think of their backgrounds. Mary, seven demons came out of her. I wonder how that demon possession contributed to her personality.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:52.400
What about Joanna? Joanna, it says, the wife of Kusa, herdsman in charge. In other words, Joanna live in herds palace. She was a woman of the court.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:04:02.400
And also Susanna. It doesn't say specifically much about her other than perhaps she was one of the women who was cured of a sickness.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:09.400
What was her personality like? How did these personalities work together?

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.400
Here's part of the example of what can help us to minister.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:32.610
And that is to realize, when we look through the gospel accounts, we never find these women bickering or arguing amongst themselves about position or prominence or place, unlike some others in the group that were with them.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:44.610
Why? Because these women focused on their ministry. They focused on their work. They served others and they served each other.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.610
And that is a powerful example for you and for me.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:05:02.610
Remember, in Isaiah chapter 11, verse 6, it's prophesied, the wolf will reside with the lamb, lions with calves. It's not going to be all lambs.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:13.610
You will meet diverse personalities in your assignments and you will have to work with diverse personalities just like the women did.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:27.610
So what will you do? Remember that some of the very qualities that make a lion or make a wolf might be exactly the qualities you need to help you fulfill your assignment.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.610
So they're not all lambs, but they all are our brothers and sisters.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:41.610
So if Jehovah allows a diversity of personalities within the context of the new personality, then so should we.

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:47.399
Diverse personalities make for rich friendships.

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:54.399
Luke wrote these words in about, or he's talking about events that took place around the Passover of 31 CE.

00:05:54.399 --> 00:06:05.399
When you think of these women, these women were with Jesus at Golgotha. These women were at the tomb.

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:14.399
Likely, these women may have been in the upper room as well. That tells us that these women endured challenging circumstances.

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:18.399
They stuck with the Lord. What helped them?

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:28.399
Look back at the verse. Verse 2. As were certain women who had been cured of wicked spirits and sicknesses.

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:34.399
These women deeply appreciated what Jesus had done for them.

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:49.399
Certainly they glorified God because of what Jesus had done for them, but they also allowed their appreciation to help them endure, to endure in a self-sacrificing life of ministering to others.

00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:56.709
So stay appreciative and that will help you endure.

00:06:56.709 --> 00:07:03.310
Our friends are dying. Our friends are getting sick.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:07.310
Meditate on how Jehovah has blessed you.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:14.310
Meditate on the little things each day. The little gifts Jehovah gives you.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:19.310
Maybe it's simply the peace in your heart and mind this day.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:27.879
Remain appreciative for that and that will help you endure as a minister in your assignment.

00:07:27.879 --> 00:07:33.879
One other thing that's noteworthy about these women is that these women were not easily thrown off by others.

00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:42.290
Remember we said we talked about others, the other disciples, when other disciples left Christ, the women stayed.

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:50.290
At Golgotha, even the apostles, to a certain degree, had left Christ or fled the women's state.

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:59.660
They stood solidly on their own faith. Brothers and sisters, do not be thrown off easily by others.

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:05.660
Sometimes you can imagine for these women with the disciples it felt like a family.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:15.660
And sometimes today in families ones choose to leave Jehovah, even at this late hour, stand solidly on your own faith.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:21.910
Like the women, do not be easily thrown off, stay with Jehovah.

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:30.910
These women must have made quite an impression on Luke because he's the only gospel writer who mentions them by name in this way.

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:36.909
An interestingly Luke was a traveling companion of Paul from about 50 CE in Troas. He picked up with Paul and started traveling with him.

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:39.909
And he traveled with him for years.

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:44.909
I wonder if they spoke together. I wonder if they spoke about these women.

00:08:44.909 --> 00:08:54.909
I wonder if they talked about how important it is to focus on the work of ministering and not to get distracted by other things.

00:08:54.909 --> 00:09:03.909
I wonder if they talked about the value of preserving unity by learning to work with different personalities.

00:09:03.909 --> 00:09:09.159
Did they talk about the power of appreciation to endure?

00:09:09.159 --> 00:09:21.159
We don't know, but what we do know is this, when Paul was in prison in Rome and he wrote his letter to the Hebrews, the congregation in Judea and Jerusalem, Luke was with him.

00:09:21.159 --> 00:09:33.159
Do you remember what Paul wrote in Hebrews 6 verse 10? He said, God is not unrighteous, so as to forget your work and the love you showed to his name by ministering.

00:09:33.159 --> 00:09:39.159
Jehovah did not forget these women and Jehovah will not forget you.

00:09:39.159 --> 00:09:53.159
May you work hard to put into practice the things that you have learned and may you be able to say that you are more outstandingly a minister of Christ.
