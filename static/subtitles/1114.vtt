00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:07.190
I've had a lifelong struggle with a negative attitude.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:14.189
My negative disposition made me a very impatient, sarcastic, and demanding person.

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:22.190
One day out in Phil's service, I had insulted a partner of mine and the entire day was ruined.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:28.190
My mother was in the car. She was very upset with the situation.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:36.189
She told me that I had a negative attitude and that I was not allowed inside the house until that sister forgave me.

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:45.189
So I asked the sister a lunch. It was one of the most difficult and uncomfortable situations I have been in.

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:49.189
I realized that I needed to make a self-examination.

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:53.189
Why was I negative? Why was I so unhappy?

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:59.189
It was because I stopped pioneering and my friends continued in their full-time service to Jehovah.

00:00:59.189 --> 00:01:04.189
And that made me very frustrated to see them continue this while I was stuck.

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:12.189
But when I acknowledged that I had this negative attitude, that prompted me to beg Jehovah to help me to make changes.

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:17.189
The friends in the congregation that I spent a lot of time with were not bad people.

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:25.859
Their imperfection fueled my negative attitude and I really had to put that fire out.

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:31.859
Personal and study was a major help with my prayer to Jehovah to make these changes.

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:36.859
One of the things I meditated on was how I just acted with his disciples.

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:41.859
When he was hungry and he was tired, he was still very loving and kind.

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:49.859
So I saw for myself when I was spiritually hungry how that affected my words and my actions towards the brothers and sisters.

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:56.859
The keys to maintaining Jesus' mental disposition are prayer, gratitude and contentment.

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:02.859
My goal is to show a grateful attitude for the blessings that I receive every day

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:07.859
and also to look for the good in people, to show them that I care and I love them.

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:13.860
And I've learned the more that I give to the friends into my family, the happier that makes Jehovah,

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.860
as Acts 2035 and Hebrews 1316 mentioned.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.860
And when Jehovah is happy, that really makes me happy.
