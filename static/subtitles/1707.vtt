00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:08.230
My name is Raj Kalaria.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.230
I was brought up as a nominal Hindu.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.230
My parents were Hindus.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.230
I went along with them to respect them.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.230
But I didn't really understand completely what Hindu religion was about.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.510
I studied medical sciences.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.510
I have degrees in neurosciences and pathology.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.510
We were taught about evolution of life.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.509
And this was just part of the curriculum.

00:00:33.509 --> 00:00:37.509
At the time, there were no other options as it were.

00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:39.509
God did not come in the picture at all,

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:42.509
or God creating the heavens and the earth as it were.

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:44.509
Never came into the picture.

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:49.859
The brain is an extremely complex organ.

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:53.859
And brain is what we are, what I am what you are.

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:55.859
No brain, no life.

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:57.859
It's as simple as that.

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:03.140
We started looking at the nerve cells themselves

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.140
in terms of their volume and the number.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.140
And it's phenomenal that in that small area of the brain

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.140
there are some 1.4 billion neurons.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.140
So the number of connections that make us synapses they make is phenomenal.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.140
Absolutely phenomenal.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.140
And so when you think about the complexity of all that,

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.140
how is it possible that that is just by random chance?

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.140
It has to be guided.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.379
Then when I was introduced to the Bible,

00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:39.379
one of the most beautiful things that struck me at the time

00:01:39.379 --> 00:01:43.379
was that there was one God coming from a Hindu background.

00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:46.379
The millions of Gods and the Trinity,

00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:51.379
which really all was mysterious and full of mythology as well.

00:01:51.379 --> 00:01:55.379
This idea of just one God, that really appealed to me.

00:01:55.379 --> 00:01:59.659
The Bible also gives us a peace of mind.

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.659
It gives us a purpose in life.

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.659
It gives us a purpose in life.
