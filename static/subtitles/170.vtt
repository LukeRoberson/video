00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.240
How would you feel if you received an invitation to attend the next class of Gilead school?

00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:10.400
For many, it has been a lifelong dream to attend Gilead.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.160
The course helps students keep a tight grip on the word of life.

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:19.839
For others, the idea of five months of intense study seems intimidating.

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:22.519
We know we need to study,

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:28.359
but we may find it a challenge to get the most out of the time we spend reading God's Word.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.719
In this program, we will discuss why study is so important.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.719
What it means to study something and how you can get more familiar study sessions.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.439
Since most cannot attend Gilead, we will demonstrate the method used in Gilead school.

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:51.560
First, why is study so important?

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.679
Only by study can we keep a tight grip on the word of life.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.399
When the Apostle Paul penned these words, he was imprisoned in nearing the end of his action-packed life.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.079
He had been the Apostle to the nations and had spent his best years taking the Word of God to the unknown world.

00:01:12.519 --> 00:01:19.560
As he reflected on the fruits of his labors, he wrote a letter to his friends in the congregation in Philippi in Macedonia.

00:01:20.519 --> 00:01:26.920
Inspired by Holy Spirit, he wrote words that would aid his brothers to gain the prize of eternal life.

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:33.719
These words are found at Philippians 2, verse 15 and 16. Let's read them.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:45.049
A so that you may come to be blameless and innocent, children of God, without a blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation,

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.730
among whom you are shining as illuminators in the world,

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.650
keeping a tight grip on the Word of Life.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.730
Imagine the joy Paul felt when he was reunited in the heavenly resurrection with those who listened

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:08.810
to his admonition to keep a tight grip on the Word of Life. Whether we have the heavenly or earthly hope,

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:15.530
Paul's words can help us gain the prize of eternal life. They imprint in our hearts and minds at

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.289
basic exhortation that will lead us through these last days and into our everlasting reward.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:30.009
The question is, will we remain blameless and without blemish in the midst of this crooked and twisted

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:37.289
generation of our day? Will we rejoice with other faithful servants of God in the new world?

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:46.250
We can and we will if we take to Hart Paul's counsel to keep a tight grip on the Word of Life.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:55.610
Next, what does it mean to study? Stop and contemplate this word picture for keeping a tight grip.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:02.169
Imagine a hiker who was slipped near a ledge, but before falling over the cliff,

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.530
he grabs hold of a tree branch. How tight do you think his grip will be on that branch?

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:15.610
This is not a half-hearted effort. Likewise, keeping a tight grip on the Word of Life is not just

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:23.930
a mechanical routine nor is it a casual habit. It requires strenuous effort. It involves

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:31.530
actively living by the truths in God's Word. To do this, we must understand more than what God

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:38.889
expressly commands and condemns. We must be able to identify principles or life lessons contained

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:46.969
in the Bible. Once identified, we must understand how to match these valuable truths to specific

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:54.090
situations in our lives. Then we must allow these principles to influence our decisions and guide

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:04.090
our reaction to trials and temptations. Ask yourself, how strong is my grip on the Word of Life?

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:13.530
To answer that, let's consider the fundamentals of Bible study. This is not about old methods or

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:20.410
new methods, nor is it about what device you are using. This discussion transcends devices.

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:28.970
Study requires active thinking. In a world of increasing distractions, this is becoming an even

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.970
greater challenge. We often receive instant information that enables us to quickly recite facts,

00:04:35.769 --> 00:04:43.610
but this is not the same as active thinking. Through active thinking, we draw meaningful conclusions

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.449
in our hearts. We are certainly grateful for all the study tools we've been given,

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:56.089
we should use these to the full. At the same time, we need to be careful that these tools

00:04:56.089 --> 00:05:02.970
do not cause us to develop mental laziness. Devices can help us to access information,

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:09.930
but they can't think for us. We must work hard if we are to develop new patterns of thinking.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:18.089
For example, if we study the Watchtower on a device, we can use the hyperlink feature to read

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:24.569
the scriptures. With a simple touch, we quickly find and read the verse. That is good.

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:32.170
If you regularly do this, you get a grip on the Word of Life. But would you like to get a tight

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:39.529
grip on the Word of Life? To get a tight grip requires more effort than a swipe of a finger

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:47.850
and then swiftly moving on. You need to slow down and analyze the material. Only then will the

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:53.610
information you study become imprinted on your mind and heart, leaving a clear and distinct

00:05:53.610 --> 00:06:02.810
impression. How then can I get more out of my study? Let's demonstrate a method taught during

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:10.170
Gilead School. It involves the use of six questions. Following poem written by English journalist

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:19.610
Rudyard Kipling can help guide better thinking. I keep six honest serving men. They taught me all I

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:29.529
knew. Their names are what and why and when and how and where and who. When studying God's Word,

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:36.250
ask yourself these questions and then do research in our publications to get the facts and

00:06:36.329 --> 00:06:44.490
discern the spiritual lessons. To illustrate how to do this, let's open our Bibles to Genesis chapter 49

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:59.019
and look at verses 22 through 25. First we ask the when and where. Now with some research,

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:05.100
we learn that Jacob spoke these words near the end of his life. He was in Egypt.

00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:11.899
But what he described takes us back to Cain in some 40 years when his son Joseph was a young man.

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:19.100
Now we have a clear picture of these verses. So now let's read and analyze verse 22.

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:29.420
Joseph is the offshoot of a fruitful tree, a fruitful tree by a spring whose branches extend over

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:37.259
the wall. The offshoot of a fruitful tree. Who is the fruitful tree? It is Joseph's father Jacob.

00:07:38.139 --> 00:07:49.259
How was he fruitful? He bore many children. Joseph's branches extend over the wall. As Jacob's offshoot,

00:07:49.259 --> 00:07:56.860
Joseph is singled out for a special blessing superior to that of his brothers. Why? Joseph proved

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:03.259
he had the qualities needed for leadership. However, of even greater value than his abilities was his

00:08:03.259 --> 00:08:12.779
being a spiritual man. Let's read verse 23. But the archers kept harassing him and shot at him and

00:08:12.779 --> 00:08:20.860
kept harboring animosity against him. The archers kept harassing him. Who are the archers? Joseph's

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:28.379
half-brothers. How? They shot figuratively at Joseph, arrows of envy and hatred and jealousy

00:08:28.379 --> 00:08:36.460
were used to attack him. Now eventually his brothers sold him into slavery. Now let's read verse 24.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:45.100
And yet his bow remained in place and his hands stayed strong and agile. This was from the hands of

00:08:45.259 --> 00:08:52.860
the powerful one of Jacob, from the shepherd, the stone of Israel. His bow remained in place. How?

00:08:53.659 --> 00:09:00.700
Despite the repeated attacks, Joseph repaid animosity with kindness. Joseph endured this ill

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:08.539
treatment and did not weaken in his devotion to God. Now we ask how? How is it that Joseph kept a

00:09:08.539 --> 00:09:14.460
spiritual outlook despite the harassment and animosity? Let's read verse 25.

00:09:16.059 --> 00:09:23.580
He, Joseph, is from the God of your Father, and he will help you, and he is with the Almighty,

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:28.539
and he will bless you with the blessings of the heavens above, with the blessings of the deep below,

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:37.980
with the blessings of the breasts, and wound. He is with the Almighty. Joseph had Jehovah's

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:45.019
help. The Almighty was by his side through it all. We've used our questions to get the facts

00:09:45.019 --> 00:09:51.419
of the account, but we're not done. Now let's use them to take our study to a spiritual plane.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:10:01.659
Next, let's ask a what question? What does this account teach us about Jehovah? Jehovah never

00:10:01.659 --> 00:10:07.899
abandons his loyal servants. Even in the depths of prison, Joseph was not alone.

00:10:08.539 --> 00:10:15.100
Jehovah found ways to bless Joseph. Now make the connection to Jehovah's people today,

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:23.500
including yourself. Jehovah will never abandon us. Rather, he shows loyal love to all those who

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:32.620
serve him whole soul. Would Jehovah let Joseph remain in prison indefinitely? No. At the

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:38.700
appointed time, relief came. Joseph was raised from a prisoner in chains to the second most

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:47.340
powerful man in Egypt, from prison to palace in one day. Make the connection to us. Our trials are

00:10:47.419 --> 00:10:55.580
temporary. Jehovah will soon bring relief, even in unexpected or surprising ways. Meanwhile,

00:10:55.580 --> 00:11:06.779
we are never alone. Jehovah is with us. Again, let's ask the question, how? How does the account

00:11:06.779 --> 00:11:14.620
contribute to the Bible's theme? Joseph suffered, but his suffering led to the survival of Abraham's

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:22.779
offspring leading to the Messiah. Joseph's account is not just a riveting story. It directly

00:11:22.779 --> 00:11:30.539
contributed to the development of Jehovah's purpose. Think about this. In spite of the poor

00:11:30.539 --> 00:11:38.059
conduct of his brothers, Joseph forgave them and took the initiative to improve their relationship

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:46.379
with him. Joseph's attitude was a reflection of Jehovah's attitude with their family reunited.

00:11:47.179 --> 00:11:53.419
Jehovah also forgave Joseph's brothers and took the initiative and restoring their relationship

00:11:53.419 --> 00:12:02.940
with himself. In fact, Jehovah gave Joseph's brother Judah the honor of being an ancestor of the Messiah.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:12.299
What are the lessons in this account? Let's highlight just one. Genesis chapter 49 and verse 23.

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:19.659
But the archers kept harassing him and shot at him and kept harboring animosity against him.

00:12:20.539 --> 00:12:30.409
Arrows of animosity were fired at Joseph. Recall Joseph's response in verse 24 and yet his

00:12:30.409 --> 00:12:38.809
bowl remained in place and his hands stayed strong and agile. In other words, he did not return

00:12:38.809 --> 00:12:46.009
fire. His bowl remained in place, reflect on the last time you were wronged by someone.

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:54.169
How could someone react to what you experienced? Would we seek to vindicate ourselves or insist on

00:12:54.169 --> 00:13:02.330
our rights? Would we fire arrows of animosity in return? Or could we show mercy and loyal love?

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:10.649
Would our reaction reveal that God's spirit was operative on us? Like Joseph, we know we will have

00:13:10.649 --> 00:13:17.450
Jehovah's approval even if we are wronged or experienced trials that make us feel like we are in prison.

00:13:18.409 --> 00:13:25.129
Reflective questions like these enable us to make the account our own. It becomes part of us,

00:13:25.129 --> 00:13:30.649
part of our way of thinking, our way of acting. This nourishes our relationship with Jehovah.

00:13:31.769 --> 00:13:38.409
This type of study rewards us, not simply with a collection of facts that impress us today and

00:13:38.409 --> 00:13:45.690
are forgotten tomorrow. Rather, it leaves us with core principles that we remember that influence

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:52.090
our decisions and that guide our lives. We tighten our grip on the word of life.

00:13:53.850 --> 00:14:00.809
Let's review the fundamentals of study. Again, this is not about old methods or new methods or

00:14:00.809 --> 00:14:08.970
about what device you are using. This discussion transcends devices. It's about basic methods of

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:17.049
Bible study. We can liken these three phases of study to gathering, sifting, and baking grain.

00:14:18.009 --> 00:14:25.370
Gathering is when we read the Bible. We don't run through the field, grabbing just handfuls of grain.

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:31.690
We systematically harvest the field. Sifting is when we sort out what we gather,

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:38.250
answering who, what, where, when, why, and how to get the facts. Baking is when we think,

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:44.169
turning up the heat in your mind and heart. Something no one else can do for you.

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:52.169
The questions we ask can take our study to a spiritual plane. Most importantly,

00:14:52.970 --> 00:15:00.009
what does this teach me about Jehovah? How does it contribute to the Bible's theme and the bottom

00:15:00.009 --> 00:15:09.980
line? What is the lesson for me? Jehovah gave us a mind that is begging to learn. It is a gift

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:16.460
with the capacity to cultivate thinking ability. When we make the effort to unearth gems from God's

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:23.740
Word, we find that study is rewarding and delightful. More importantly, our study skills enable us to

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:31.100
keep a tight grip on the word of life. A tight grip on God's Word will make our life better now,

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:43.659
and give us the opportunity to continue learning about our Heavenly Father for all eternity.
