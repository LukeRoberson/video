00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:06.980
Welcome to JW Broadcasting and the March program.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.980
We are confident it will be faith strengthening to all of us.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.980
Brother John Ekran is joining me today.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.980
John, what can we look forward to?

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:16.980
Thank you.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.980
We have many spiritual gems to share.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.980
For example, if you live in a religiously divided household,

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.980
what will help you to take a stand for Jehovah despite pressure from others?

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.979
Also, we will visit the Bible exhibit at World Headquarters.

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:36.979
And here's some very interesting experiences about its future expansion.

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:43.979
And we have a music video about how we can seek first the kingdom in our day-to-day activities.

00:00:43.979 --> 00:01:12.180
My comments to you today are based on 2nd Peter chapter 1 verse 19.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.180
There it states, we have the prophetic word made more sure.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.180
Yes, we are fortified by the prophetic word.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.180
Actually, there is no one on earth today that is not affected by prophecy,

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.180
even if he is not aware of it.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.180
What is a prophecy?

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:39.180
The Hebrew term for prophecy is not limited to predicting or foretelling something in the future.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.180
It also includes divine commands or inspired instruction.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.180
The Samaritan woman at the well recognized Jesus as a prophet

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.180
because he revealed not future things, but things about her past

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.180
that he could not have known except by divine power.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.180
The source of all true prophecy is Jehovah God.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.180
At 2nd Peter chapter 1 verse 21, it is said of prophecy

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.180
that men spoke from God as they were moved by Holy Spirit.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.180
In addition to transmitting prophecy by Holy Spirit,

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.180
Jehovah occasionally communicated such messages by means of angels.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.180
One outstanding prophet was Daniel.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.180
In about 536 before our common era,

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.180
Daniel recorded a vision involving world powers,

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.180
having interaction with God's servants.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.180
Turned with me to Daniel chapter 8 verses 21 and 22.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.180
Daniel's vision was of animals representing governments.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.180
Note this remarkable prophecy at Daniel chapter 8 verses 21 and 22.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.360
The hairy male goat stands for the King of Greece

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.360
and the great horn that was between its eyes stands for the first King.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.360
As for the horn that was broken so that force stood up instead of it,

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.360
there are four kingdoms from his nation that will stand up but not with his power.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.830
Interestingly, the Bible specifically named Greece,

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.830
the ruler under which Greece became a world power in relation to God's people

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.830
like a great horn was the Macedonian Alexander the Great.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.830
Alexander's rulership was short-lived.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.830
He died young in the year 323 before our common era,

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.830
213 years after Daniel wrote his book.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:56.830
Jehovah's angel had told Daniel that there would be four kingdoms from his nation

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.830
that will stand up in place of the Grecian Empire.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:09.830
And chapter 11 verse 4 specifically states that the four regions would not go to his descendants.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.830
Do the historical facts support these prophecies?

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:20.829
Yes, Alexander's two sons from different women, Heracles and Alexander the Fourth

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.829
both were killed before they reached adulthood.

00:04:23.829 --> 00:04:28.829
Isn't it astounding how precisely the prophecy came true

00:04:28.829 --> 00:04:33.829
that the rulership would not be passed on to Alexander's posterity?

00:04:33.829 --> 00:04:41.829
But the prophecy also foretold that Alexander's empire would be divided up into four kingdoms.

00:04:41.829 --> 00:04:43.829
Did that happen?

00:04:43.829 --> 00:04:51.829
Yes, one source listed 72 different military leaders under Alexander the Great.

00:04:51.829 --> 00:04:56.829
But the prophecy said only four would eventually rule in his place.

00:04:57.829 --> 00:05:03.829
After Alexander's death, there were constant fierce battles between these military leaders

00:05:03.829 --> 00:05:10.829
but finally just four dynasties resulted, just as the Bible prophesied.

00:05:10.829 --> 00:05:17.829
One was that of General Cassander, son of Antipater, in Macedonia and Greece.

00:05:17.829 --> 00:05:25.829
The second was that of General Le Simichus in Asia Minor and European Thrace.

00:05:25.829 --> 00:05:33.829
Third was the one of General Seljukus, Nikitor, the Conqueror, who secured Babylon,

00:05:33.829 --> 00:05:40.829
media, Syria, Persia and the provinces eastward to the Indus River.

00:05:40.829 --> 00:05:52.829
And finally the fourth was that of General Thalumi Sotr, son of Lagus, who secured Egypt, Libya, Arabia, Palestine and Silis Syria.

00:05:52.829 --> 00:06:01.829
These four proclaimed themselves King around 305 before our common era, 18 years after the death of Alexander.

00:06:01.829 --> 00:06:10.829
The prophecy was so detailed, its fulfillment is fascinating proof of divine inspiration.

00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:18.620
Does this not strengthen your faith and trust in the Bible? Here's another point.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.620
What is the first prophecy in the Bible?

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:29.620
The first prophecy ever was the one uttered by Jehovah at Genesis chapter 3 verse 15.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:36.620
It foretold that the offspring of his figurative wife, the heavenly part of his organization,

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:42.620
would crush Satan and his offspring, bringing liberation to mankind.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:51.620
To identify this offspring, primarily Christ Jesus, Jehovah arranged for many prophecies pointing to him.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:07:04.620
Revelation chapter 19 verse 10 says, the witness concerning Jesus is what inspires prophecy, or literally is the spirit of prophecy.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.620
What does that mean?

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:14.620
That all inspired Messianic messages from God proclaimed by his servants, pointed to his son.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:25.620
At Luke chapter 24 verse 44, Jesus himself said that all the prophecies concerning the Messiah must be fulfilled.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:31.620
Let's consider some outstanding prophecies about Jesus and their fulfillment.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:41.000
One was that he would be born of the tribe of Judah from the family of David, the son of Jesse.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:50.000
More than 700 years before Jesus was born, Micah foretold in chapter 5 that he would be born in Bethlehem.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
The prophecy speaks of Bethlehem Ephrathah.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Why is the designation Ephrathah important?

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Because there existed another Bethlehem in the territory of Zebulun.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:12.000
It has been identified with bead lamb about seven miles or 11 kilometers west, northwest of Nazareth.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Again, the prophecy was extremely specific, and amazingly I say a prophesied he would be born of a virgin.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
What human would ever think of such a thing?

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Daniel chapter 9 foretold that the Messiah would arrive 483 years after the command to rebuild Jerusalem.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.000
This proved to be true in the year 29 of Archermen era, when Jesus was baptized.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Zachariah chapter 11 foretold that the Messiah would be betrayed for 30 pieces of silver.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Chapter 12 says that his body would be pierced.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:03.000
It was foretold that the Messiah would die a sacrificial death for our sins and be buried in the tomb of a rich man.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Furthermore, prophecy proclaimed that he would be in the grave for parts of three days and then be resurrected.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:21.000
What about the argument that Jesus deliberately arranged matters so that the events in his life would fit all these prophecies?

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:30.000
What do you think? Could Jesus have arranged to be born of the tribe of Judah in the town of David's birth, Bethlehem?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:42.000
His mother Mary lived in Nazareth. Could he tell her while in the womb, please take me to Bethlehem because the Scripture says, I must be born there.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Obviously, the very start of his life on earth was beyond his control.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Furthermore, could Jesus have arranged for the priests to pay Judas the 30 pieces of silver to betray him?

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Could he have arranged that his enemies bid in his face, that the Roman authorities sentenced him to be nailed to a stake?

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:17.000
That the soldiers cast lots for his garments? Or that while piercing his sight with a spear, they not follow the custom of breaking any of his bones?

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Could the prophecies just mention have been fulfilled by mere chance?

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:31.000
One Bible scholar likened this process to the assembling of a statue made of individual pieces of marble.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Imagine that many men who had never communicated with one another each brought a piece of marble into a room.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:54.000
If those pieces fit together to form a perfect statue, you would logically conclude that there must have been someone behind the scenes who had drawn the specifications and sent an assignment to each man.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:06.500
Fitting together like the pieces of the statue, every messianic prophecy would provide a vital piece of information about the Messiah.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:16.500
What then would be the likelihood of all the prophecies about the Messiah being fulfilled by coincidence in one person?

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:21.500
In an interview, researcher Louis Lapides said,

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:34.500
someone did the math and figured out that the probability of just eight prophecies being fulfilled by Jesus is one chance in 100 million billion.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:48.500
To arrive at the figure mentioned by this scholar by addition rather than by multiplication, you would have to write down one million and then copy that figure a billion times.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:12:06.500
Putting those odds in perspective, the scholars stated, if you took 100 million billion silver dollars, they would cover the state of Texas in the United States to a depth of two feet or 0.6 meters.

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:23.500
Texas has a land area of 266,807 square miles or 690,000 square kilometers. Imagine that huge area covered in silver dollars up to a depth of two feet.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:38.500
Now, what if you put a mark on just one of those silver dollars and then had a blindfolded person wander the whole state and bend down to pick up just one coin?

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:44.500
What would be the chance that he choose the only coin that had been marked?

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:55.500
The scholar then stated that those are the same odds that anybody in history could have fulfilled just eight of the Messianic prophecies.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:07.500
Yet Jesus fulfilled not just eight but many more Bible prophecies. This is overwhelming proof of divine inspiration.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:16.500
In Corinthians chapter 1 verse 20 says, no matter how many the promises of God are, they have become yes by means of Jesus.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:27.500
What does this mean for us? It means that Jesus was actually the promised Messiah who was sent by God. As such, he taught the truth.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:38.500
If we believe him and follow him, then we too have the truth. There's no doubt about the divine origin of Bible prophecies.

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:49.500
But Bible prophecies deal not only with past events, some prophecies are having remarkable fulfillment right now before our eyes.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:14:06.500
This gives us strong assurance that the few outstanding prophecies about the end of this wicked system of things and the paradise on earth to come will also be fulfilled in the near future without any possibility of failure.

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:20.500
As true Christians, we are engaged in a prophetic work. This is not in the sense that we initiate new prophecies, but in the sense that we proclaim prophecies already written down in the Bible.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:43.500
At Pentecost 33 of our common era, when Holy Spirit was poured out on 120 disciples, both men and women, Peter quoted the prophet Joel saying, in the last days, God says, I will pour out some of my spirit on every sort of flesh and your sons and your daughters will prophesy.

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:58.500
What did the 120 disciples do at Pentecost? There's no indication that they foretold new events, but Acts chapter 2 verse 11 says, we hear them speaking about the magnificent things of God.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:11.500
This was called prophesying. Today too, whether brothers or sisters or children, we share in a prophetic work speaking about the magnificent things of God.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:26.500
We speak about what he has done, what he is doing now, and what he will do in the near future. What a privilege. Having seen many prophecies fulfilled, we have the prophetic work made more sure.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:38.500
And we are telling people about the prophetic work in order to fortify their faith too. Yes, we do it to help them get to the road to everlasting life,

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:50.500
and to develop an intimate relationship with our great God, Jehovah. But sharing in the prophetic work also involves distributing literature around the world.

00:15:50.500 --> 00:16:01.500
And we have recently made some adjustments that will simplify the work of some of our branches. I understand you know more about that, John.

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:20.879
That's right. You probably remember our visit to the Canada Shipping Department in the January program. And thanks to modern technology, shipping departments around the world have recently seen a change that has sped up their work tremendously.

00:16:20.879 --> 00:16:36.879
Around the world, large shipping branches can receive literature requests from over 15,000 congregations a month. When you consider the number of publications and languages in which these publications are available, filling these requests could seem daunting.

00:16:36.879 --> 00:16:41.879
So how have we adapted to meet this ever growing demand?

00:16:41.879 --> 00:16:46.879
For decades, large conveyor systems were iconic of our shipping departments.

00:16:46.879 --> 00:17:00.879
Literature requests moved along belts and were packaged by brothers and sisters. However, conveyors operated only as fast as a slowest worker and could not expand easily for growth in additional languages.

00:17:00.879 --> 00:17:18.880
So in 2010, the governing body approved a new shipping arrangement called Pick to Cart. At first glance, a picking cart might seem a bit old-fashioned compared to the conveyor system. However, a closer look reveals a different story.

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:38.880
Once a congregation request is ready to be filled, a computer program, which was prepared by our brothers, calculates and assigns all of the publications to a specific number of cartons. It stipulates which carton size to use, where the carton should be placed on the cart, and which palette it will eventually land on.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:53.880
How does this information get to the person filling the request? By means of a wireless network, information appears on a computer arm terminal worn by each worker. Additionally, address labels with barcodes are printed for each carton.

00:17:53.880 --> 00:18:05.880
Cartons are placed on the cart according to the direction shown on the arm terminal. Then by means of barcode scanning, the setup of the cart is verified for accuracy.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:17.880
The arm terminal directs our brother or sister to the correct pick location, displays the quantity needed for each item, and even indicates which box to put the item in.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:28.880
The barcode on the cart is then scanned for verification or possible errors. Once all of the items are verified, packing lists are generated automatically.

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:37.880
Barcode scanning verifies the packing list are placed into the correct carton, and palettes are prepared for shipment to the congregations.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:53.880
The Pictocart software monitors each pick from each picking location. When needed, the software automatically sends an electronic request to replenish the shells with new literature, so that the worker always has literature available to fill congregation requests.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:19:07.319
The nine branches currently using Pictocart have already experienced many benefits. One is speed. With the use of carts, individuals can move separately at their own pace.

00:19:07.319 --> 00:19:15.319
This has resulted in approximately 100 fewer workers in branches using Pictocart around the world.

00:19:15.319 --> 00:19:25.319
Compared to other technologies, the installation of the Pictocart system is inexpensive and can easily be expanded to support additional publications and languages.

00:19:25.319 --> 00:19:38.319
Previously, in many branches, each carton had to be double-checked manually before sealing. However, this step is now eliminated because of the accuracy of barcode scanning.

00:19:38.319 --> 00:19:55.319
The Pictocart process has simplified and unified shipping operations worldwide. Most importantly, it fills a vital role in ensuring that our brothers and sisters in the congregations receive the exact literature that they request for use in their preaching work.

00:19:55.319 --> 00:20:05.950
The publications put into these carts are reaching hearts all over the world. You can call it from cart to heart.

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:13.950
It's encouraging to see how Jehovah is speeding up the work. After all, the prophetic word in the Bible makes it very clear.

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:16.950
Isaiah 60-22 says,

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:26.950
The little one will become a thousand, and the small one a mighty nation. I, myself, Jehovah will speed it up in its own time.

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:34.950
Another great example of Jehovah guiding his servants is the construction of the Wal-Kill Bethel complex here in the United States.

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:42.950
Now before that location was acquired and built, the organization owned another property outside of New York City called Kingdom Farm.

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:55.950
That's actually where the Gilead School was held at the time. But the location was not ideal. So Brother George Couch was assigned to find a new property that later became Wal-Kill Bethel.

00:20:55.950 --> 00:21:00.950
Brother Couch served at World Headquarters until his death in 2007.

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:07.950
Please enjoy listening to his account of what happened, told in a way that only our dear Brother Couch could.

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:23.539
Brother Nora stayed around in this early 60s sometime about looking at getting another farm closer to New York so we didn't have to travel so far.

00:21:23.539 --> 00:21:32.539
So one cold Saturday morning, I called Brother Larson and I said, Brother Larson, you want to take a trip with me?

00:21:32.539 --> 00:21:39.539
He said, I'll go with you. I didn't tell him where it was going. So we come up here to the Goulville place.

00:21:39.539 --> 00:21:47.539
And I come up with the intention of asking Brother Goulville where he advised us to look for buying a farm.

00:21:48.539 --> 00:22:00.539
And so we got here about 10 o'clock in cold. They have finished the barn work and we come in the house and had a cup of coffee and had a bite breakfast with them.

00:22:00.539 --> 00:22:05.539
And of course they kept looking at us wondering, what in the world are you doing up here?

00:22:05.539 --> 00:22:17.539
So finally we said, we're thinking of getting a farm closer to New York than Kingdom Farm and thought maybe it had some ideas.

00:22:17.539 --> 00:22:26.539
And it just stunned them. They looked at one another and then they looked at us and I don't know what in the world did we say wrong?

00:22:26.539 --> 00:22:35.539
And she said, you know, yesterday we put this farm up for sale and we were the buyers of it then.

00:22:35.539 --> 00:22:52.539
But we had no workers and so one Tuesday morning, Brother Norm, Brother Larson and I were coming up here to the farm and we brought up the subject of where we going to get help.

00:22:52.539 --> 00:23:05.539
Brother Norm made this suggestion on why don't you bring in some circuit and district overseers and call them in for a short time and have them help.

00:23:05.539 --> 00:23:14.539
And so we had the file with this of the circuit district overseer. So on our way up we picked out 50 circuit and district overseers.

00:23:14.539 --> 00:23:23.539
We wrote them a letter and told them it was a special assignment. It would only last about six months.

00:23:23.539 --> 00:23:32.539
We didn't have a typewriter, we didn't have a computer, we didn't have blueprints when we started the job.

00:23:32.539 --> 00:23:44.539
Brother Dexter Bushing, he bought himself a calculator to do the stress and then strain the figure and work on it and that's how we built the building.

00:23:44.539 --> 00:23:57.539
The schedule was from daylight to dark. We set up a temporary kitchen in the farmhouse and fed cafeteria style which worked out quite well.

00:23:57.539 --> 00:24:09.539
The brothers ate in the porch out in the yard and wherever they could sit down. We got the basement in on the farm building and the brothers put beds in there.

00:24:09.539 --> 00:24:25.539
So it was a makeshift. We had everything but tents. And I'd say most of our pick and shovel brothers, they slept in the corn cribs, they slept in the hay mow, they slept anywhere they could put a bunk up.

00:24:25.539 --> 00:24:39.819
All the brothers at Brooklyn Bethel with 25 years or more senior already were invited to come up and they had a nice steak meal for us.

00:24:39.819 --> 00:24:49.819
Brother Norgate the dedication talk and then he called in brother friends to say a few words.

00:24:50.819 --> 00:25:00.819
And brother friends get up and he started back in the garden to feed and with Adam and Eve that what he was saying the man started off as a farmer.

00:25:00.819 --> 00:25:13.819
And he sort of developed that to a certain extent. After that I came up here every week no doubt for the next 10 to 15 years.

00:25:13.819 --> 00:25:22.819
I saw the brothers turn this piece of ground from a junk yard to a paradise is today.

00:25:22.819 --> 00:25:34.819
That started the society in their construction work, our own construction work. Then we built several other buildings after that we saw we could do it.

00:25:34.819 --> 00:25:49.819
And the interesting thing is it wasn't long after that we started to send the brothers into foreign lands to help the brothers build the branch homes, missionary homes, kingdom halls.

00:25:49.819 --> 00:25:58.819
Just to be honest with it we had to get out of New York. Our buildings weren't big enough to take the modern presses.

00:25:58.819 --> 00:26:13.420
There were high enough the weight limit or buildings wouldn't hold them. You couldn't buy land in New York City to put up a building like you had there.

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:22.420
It was almost an impossibility. So there was only one thing to do our presses were old and we had to replace them.

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:31.420
No place in New York to put them we looked for land but we couldn't find any place. The Lord just drove us up here.

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:40.420
When you look back over things sometimes you think my someone had some wise thinking and a good foresight.

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:52.420
No the Lord Spirit didn't. The Lord's running the organization. It's a pediatric organization. Sometimes it's surprising where the idea comes from the what you're going to do.

00:26:52.420 --> 00:27:00.420
Don't worry about what it's going to be like after Armageddon. It'll be just the way we wanted because the Lord's going to do it.

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:07.420
The Lord didn't see fit the put into the Bible we don't need to know now. We got our hands full now just preaching.

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:11.420
What the Lord has in mind for the future? Who knows?

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:24.559
Jehovah's direction was clear. Many brothers and sisters worked very hard on that construction project and we know that Jehovah blessed their efforts.

00:27:24.559 --> 00:27:34.559
And there's a great need for more zealous workers in the organization today. If you're young are you trying to determine what to do with your life?

00:27:34.559 --> 00:27:46.559
Maybe pioneer work at Bethel or maybe pursue a career? It's a big decision to make and requires many sincere prayers to Jehovah for wisdom.

00:27:46.559 --> 00:28:03.420
But if you're in a religiously divided household it could be your facing some unique challenges when deciding your future. This young man is going through just that.

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:20.160
My name is Marcus. I've got a good life and a good family but lately I'm really having a tough time.

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:32.529
Mom was baptized a few years ago as one of Jehovah's Witnesses. She studies the Bible with me and the two of us go to meetings and out in the men's shoe together.

00:28:32.529 --> 00:28:48.049
But I'm being pulled in other directions. My dad owns his own business and he takes care of us. He's always telling me success is security.

00:28:48.049 --> 00:29:01.809
He seems pretty sure that sports and going to college will prepare for the real world. He's not a witness and I'm not always sure how he feels about my Bible study.

00:29:01.809 --> 00:29:17.099
I guess we've avoided talking about it. My brother Todd and I used to hang out a lot but he doesn't have much time for me anymore especially when Amy calls.

00:29:17.099 --> 00:29:29.279
He says if I get baptized I won't be allowed to have any fun. My cousins live two doors down. For years they'd come back after school.

00:29:29.279 --> 00:29:56.539
But lately they've been into some stuff that I know was wrong. It's hard to say no. I was starting to get really confused. My household was divided and so was I.

00:29:56.539 --> 00:30:08.539
My tough day was about to get worse. It was meeting it for mom and I. But dad wanted me to stay for a big party with his family.

00:30:08.539 --> 00:30:23.180
I hate feeling like I constantly disappoint him. As it turned out Jeremy was visiting for the first time since going to Bethel.

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:35.180
Mom said that his family was just like ours and that his decision to serve Jehovah took courage. He wrote a scripture from 1 Peter chapter 5.

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:43.180
Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God so that he may exalt you in due time.

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:54.430
He thought about it but I guess I didn't really understand what he was saying. That weekend Jeremy asked her work with me in field service.

00:30:54.430 --> 00:31:10.430
We talked more about how 1 Peter chapter 5 helped him decide what to do. His heart was divided but he said that humbling himself meant doing God's will and then trusting that Jehovah could make his heart catch up later.

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:32.579
He knew Jehovah cared for him and that there were only two choices. Jehovah's way or Satan's. Then he read verse 9 to me but take your stand against him firm in the faith and he asked me to do two things when I got home.

00:31:32.579 --> 00:31:46.829
He said I should pray about my situation and second he said that I should try and think of a Bible character who took a stand for Jehovah.

00:31:46.829 --> 00:31:58.750
Timothy took a stand and chose spiritual goals explaining that to his father would have taken courage.

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:13.900
Talking to my dad would be tough. Just another time he'd be disappointed in me. But Timothy's example and Jeremy's encouragement helped me realize exactly what I had to do.

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:22.240
It wasn't easy. Dad loves me but I know he doesn't fully understand my choice.

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:34.240
But I explained how my Bible study has already helped me. At school I've been offered drugs, approached my girls, tempted to fight but I've resisted it all.

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:48.660
And that made that think. I know that won't be our last conversation but it's a start. I know which way to go now.

00:32:48.660 --> 00:33:07.150
I've chosen Jehovah's way and my heart is no longer divided and I'm convinced. Jehovah is with me.

00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:16.150
Don't you agree that Marcus made the right decision? But did you notice how important the support of the visiting brother was to him?

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:24.150
The personal interest he displayed made quite a difference in Marcus' determination to take a stand for Jehovah.

00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:34.150
Earlier today I had the opportunity to speak with one of the brothers backstage. His mother's a witness but his father has yet to embrace the truth.

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:41.150
But something he really appreciated while growing up was how attentive the brothers in the congregation were.

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:48.150
For example, he was invited to join an elder in his family when they visited a neighboring congregation to give a public talk.

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:57.150
And the elder explained to him what a speaker needs to keep in mind when preparing the talk, when giving the talk and so forth.

00:33:57.150 --> 00:34:01.150
You know that was very valuable training for that young brother.

00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:12.150
And even today, many years later, this brother remembers and appreciates the loving care he received from so many in the congregation.

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:19.150
Although we all have a responsibility to assist one another, the elders are charged with taking the lead in caring for the flock.

00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:29.150
This is important in the case of divided households because we know how Jehovah feels about those who are spiritually or physically fatherless.

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:39.150
Psalm 68 verse 5 says that Jehovah is the father of the fatherless and a protector of widows.

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:44.780
Yes, Jehovah loves you very much.

00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:52.780
But now let's join Mark Sanderson as he provides us with some exciting news about one of the exhibits in our main lobby here in Brooklyn.

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:57.780
The exhibit highlights how we want to preserve the prophetic word.

00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:14.159
At the annual meeting of Jehovah's Witnesses held in October 2013, the governing body was pleased to announce the opening of a new display in Brooklyn, New York, entitled The Bible and the Divine Name.

00:35:14.159 --> 00:35:18.159
We're happy to provide you with an update on what has happened since that time.

00:35:18.159 --> 00:35:22.159
Our brothers have been excited about the display.

00:35:22.159 --> 00:35:27.159
More than 133,000 have come to visit since the opening.

00:35:27.159 --> 00:35:34.159
Many have also shown their interest by donating rare and valuable Bibles to enhance this collection.

00:35:34.159 --> 00:35:40.159
We are pleased to share some information about some of these fascinating Bibles.

00:35:40.159 --> 00:35:51.159
At the 2013 annual meeting, we expressed interest in obtaining a first edition copy of the King James Bible, which was printed in the year 1611.

00:35:51.159 --> 00:35:55.159
Well, we received a surprising email shortly thereafter.

00:35:55.159 --> 00:36:00.159
A brother wrote and told us that he had located the King James Bible we were looking for.

00:36:00.159 --> 00:36:09.159
He explained that while visiting with an elderly couple in his congregation, he mentioned that the governing body was interested in locating this particular Bible.

00:36:09.159 --> 00:36:15.159
Well, apparently the brother's eyes lit up and he said, I have one, but how could that be?

00:36:15.159 --> 00:36:20.159
How could he have not just a rare Bible, but the exact one we were looking for?

00:36:20.159 --> 00:36:26.159
We had to wonder if it really was the very rare first edition of the King James Bible.

00:36:26.159 --> 00:36:31.159
How would you know if you had a first edition King James Bible?

00:36:31.159 --> 00:36:39.159
In 1604, King James I of England endorsed an updated English language translation to be read in the churches.

00:36:39.159 --> 00:36:45.159
The first edition can be identified by a number of unique printing variations.

00:36:45.159 --> 00:36:52.159
The combination of variations that occur in a given Bible serves as the kind of fingerprint.

00:36:52.159 --> 00:37:04.159
The variation most commonly associated with the first edition of the King James Bible is founded Ruth chapter 3 verse 15, which reads, he went into the city.

00:37:04.159 --> 00:37:09.159
Subsequent editions have the rendering she went into the city.

00:37:09.159 --> 00:37:13.159
So the first edition is commonly known as the he Bible.

00:37:13.159 --> 00:37:19.159
We were excited when we saw that the donated copyright he went into the city.

00:37:19.159 --> 00:37:28.159
When the Bible arrived, it was obvious that the binding of this 400-year-old book needed restoration, but the pages of the Bible were an excellent condition.

00:37:28.159 --> 00:37:36.159
A brother from Belgium, who was a specialist in book conservation, was able to come and teach us how to restore this valuable Bible.

00:37:36.159 --> 00:37:41.159
We started the process of restoration by carefully removing each page.

00:37:41.159 --> 00:37:45.159
Then we gently cleaned the pages and made any needed repairs.

00:37:45.159 --> 00:37:51.159
Next, we rebound the Bible using techniques that were used at the time when it was printed.

00:37:51.159 --> 00:37:54.159
Lastly, we bound the Bible in a leather cover.

00:37:54.159 --> 00:38:01.980
It has been fully restored so that it may be enjoyed for many years to come.

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:06.980
The King James Bible is one of the most significant books in the English language.

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:17.980
According to the British Library, the King James, or authorized version of the Bible, remains the most widely published text in the English language.

00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:23.980
Some estimate the number of printed copies to be over one billion.

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:29.980
Protestant missionaries often used it as the basis for translating the Bible into other languages.

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:33.980
This made its influence even greater.

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:42.980
Down through the centuries, as the King James Bible was circulated, the name of Jehovah became known around the earth.

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:52.980
We have also received two very important Spanish language Bible translations, the Reina Bible and the Reina Valera Bible.

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:57.980
Both were produced during the height of the Spanish Inquisition.

00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:09.980
By the close of the 15th century, the Spanish Inquisition forbade the translation and possession of the Scriptures in any vernacular or common language.

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:15.980
Three centuries passed before the ban was finally lifted.

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:25.980
During that difficult time, a few valiant translators produced new Spanish versions abroad and had them smuggled into Spain.

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:35.980
In the mid-1500s, living on a constant fear of arrest, Casiodoro de Reina began translating the Bible into Spanish.

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:37.980
This man loved God's name.

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:51.980
He once said the custom of a meeting God's name perpetrated by the devil arose from a superstition of modern rabbis who, although claiming to revered, in fact, buried his holy name,

00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:58.980
making God's people forget that by which he wished to be distinguished from all other gods.

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:04.980
In 1569, Casiodoro de Reina's translation was finally printed.

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:09.980
It preserved the divine name Jehovah throughout the Hebrew Scriptures.

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:19.980
Then, in 1582, another brave scholar, Cipriano de Valera, carefully began to revise Reina's translation.

00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:26.980
He was 50 years old when he started and he labored on this translation for the next 20 years.

00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:32.980
In 1602, his work was finally published in Amsterdam.

00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:39.980
Valera also valued the divine name and he used it throughout the Hebrew Scriptures.

00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:43.980
Today, his translation is known as the Reina Valera Bible.

00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:50.980
It has become one of the most widely used translations in the Spanish-speaking world.

00:40:50.980 --> 00:41:01.980
These Bibles remind us of the intense struggle that has taken place to translate the Bible into common languages and to preserve the divine name.

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:11.980
Our brothers have manifested tremendous generosity by donating these Bibles and we continue to be amazed by the Bibles that we are receiving.

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:14.980
Consider another unique example.

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:21.980
In 1964, a man found a 250-year-old Latin Bible in the basement of a church.

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:23.980
This was a unique find.

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:30.980
The most common edition of the Latin Bible, translated by Jerome, was completed in the year 405.

00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:37.980
It came to be known as the Latin Volgate. Sadly, it does not use the divine name.

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:45.980
However, the Bible that was found in the church basement consistently uses God's name throughout the Hebrew Scriptures.

00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:51.980
It was the 1708 edition of the Latin translation, produced by Sebastian Schmidt.

00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:58.980
At first, when the man discovered this Bible, he was told to burn it, but he just couldn't.

00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:03.980
Recently, this man began studying the Bible with Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:10.980
When he heard about the Bible display, he donated this very interesting Latin Bible.

00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:15.980
Later, when he came to the display and saw the Bible there, he said,

00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:25.980
After 50 years of this Bible sitting in my house, it is thrilling to see thousands of people finally able to enjoy it.

00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:32.980
In the early 16th century, many people had a strong desire to know more about the Bible.

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:44.980
By that time, the Latin Volgate had been the common Bible for more than 1,000 years, but sadly, most people could not read Latin.

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:52.980
Adding to the problem, many errors had crept into the Volgate as it was copied over the centuries.

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:59.980
Translators and scholars realized that they needed to go back to the original languages

00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:07.980
if they were to produce accurate Bible translations that would satisfy the growing thirst for scriptural knowledge.

00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:17.980
In 1,502, Cardinal Jimenez, the Cisneros, began work on what would become a historic Bible translation tool.

00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:21.980
Today, it is known as the Complutensian Polyglot.

00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:28.980
Cisneros began gathering as many ancient manuscripts as he could find in Hebrew, Greek and Latin.

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:38.980
Then a team of scholars started to compare the manuscripts with the idea of producing one complete master text for each of the three languages.

00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:46.980
It took the scholars 10 years to compile this monumental work, and then the actual printing took another 4 years.

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:54.980
Spanish printers did not have the necessary typefans and had to prepare them before the Bible could be printed.

00:43:54.980 --> 00:44:02.980
Finally, between 1,514 and 1,517, the 6th volume set was printed.

00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:08.980
After some 15 years of effort, this was an overwhelming accomplishment.

00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:19.980
It was the first time that Hebrew, Greek and Latin master text for the entire Bible were printed side by side, making them easy to compare.

00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:25.980
Actually, this was the first time that the complete New Testament had ever been printed in Greek.

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:34.980
However, the Pope did not give approval to the Polyglot until years later, delaying its public release until 1522.

00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:44.980
The Complutensian Polyglot was an important step in the refinement and preservation of the Greek and Hebrew text of God's Word.

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:53.980
Of the approximately 600 copies originally printed, only about 1,5th are known to have survived until today.

00:44:53.980 --> 00:45:03.980
At about the same time that the Complutensian Polyglot was produced, another scholar, Desiderios Erasmus, was working on his Greek New Testament.

00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:12.980
He too wanted to make available the complete printed Greek New Testament for the use of scholars and Bible translators.

00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:16.980
He was able to publish his work in 1516.

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:27.980
Because the distribution of the Complutensian Polyglot was delayed, Erasmus Greek New Testament became the first complete printed edition available to scholars.

00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:39.980
Groundbreaking translators such as Martin Luther and William Tyndale used various editions of his text to accomplish their work of translating the Greek scriptures into German and English.

00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:52.980
We are pleased to inform you that the Complutensian Polyglot and Erasmus Greek New Testament of 1516 have both been donated to the Bible display.

00:45:52.980 --> 00:46:01.980
Of course, those who have visited the display may have difficulty imagining that we would have enough space to include these fascinating Bibles there.

00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:09.980
We are pleased to announce that the designated area for the Bible display at Warwick will be much larger.

00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:11.980
Would you like to see what it will look like?

00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:16.980
The governing body has directed that the display should feature the Bible.

00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:20.980
The Bible itself should be the star of the display.

00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:25.980
And in particular, the focus should be on Jehovah's name.

00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:34.980
Therefore, the overall design of the display will communicate a feeling of deep respect and reverence for God's Word.

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:44.980
We will use strong architectural features to illustrate the strength and security that come from reading and applying God's Word.

00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:50.980
The lighting and interior design will help to create a spiritually reflective environment.

00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:54.980
The main part of the display will be permanent in nature.

00:46:54.980 --> 00:47:00.980
It will continue to tell the story of the Bible and the divine name as in the current exhibit in Brooklyn.

00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:08.980
There will also be an area for additional exhibits where we will display many other rare and unique Bibles.

00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:11.980
This area will be updated periodically.

00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:19.980
Of course, the Bibles that we have discussed are only a few of the many that have been generously donated.

00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:26.980
We have also received items such as the Leipzig Polyglot and the Julia E. Smith Bible.

00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:35.980
Julia E. Smith was the first woman to make a complete English translation of the Bible from the original Hebrew and Greek.

00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:42.980
She produced a literal translation and in her work she chose to preserve the divine name.

00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:51.980
We can't mention all of the donations in this brief update, but if you visit the Bible display when it opens in Warwick, New York,

00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:54.980
you will be able to see many of them there.

00:47:54.980 --> 00:48:02.980
By that time, we hope to have received even more rare and unique Bibles to add to the display.

00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:16.980
These Bibles remind us of the many God-fearing people down through the ages who work tirelessly to preserve God's Word and to make known His holy name.

00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:27.980
They also show that Jehovah has fulfilled His promise to preserve His Word and to magnify His name in all the earth.

00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:39.980
We invite all of you to come and see the Bible display at our current World Headquarters in Brooklyn and later when it is greatly expanded in Warwick.

00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:50.980
We are certain that it will deepen your appreciation for God's precious Word and for His matchless name, Jehovah.

00:48:50.980 --> 00:49:00.929
The truths pen down in the Bible can truly change lives. That's why we treasure the Bible in its message.

00:49:00.929 --> 00:49:07.929
After all, it is the prophetic Word about God's Kingdom that gives us hope for the future.

00:49:07.929 --> 00:49:12.929
We can only imagine what life will be like under a perfect government.

00:49:12.929 --> 00:49:23.929
Our team met a sister from Louisiana in the United States who spent many years as a political activist, hoping to make a difference by changing the decisions of a secular government.

00:49:23.929 --> 00:49:32.469
But instead, the truth transformed her life.

00:49:32.469 --> 00:49:39.469
My name's Nancy Simon. I'm a private music teacher in a small town in southwest Louisiana.

00:49:39.469 --> 00:49:47.469
I have a very productive and a happy, satisfying life, but it wasn't always that way.

00:49:47.469 --> 00:49:59.469
Back in the 1970s, I became involved with a group of young people who were heavily involved in protesting the government and in particular the Vietnam War.

00:49:59.469 --> 00:50:12.469
We felt so strongly about the war that we actually blockaded a presidential candidate in his hotel so that he would come down and talk to us.

00:50:12.469 --> 00:50:18.469
During that time period, I also became heavily involved with drug use.

00:50:18.469 --> 00:50:25.469
As a matter of fact, I would say that it was pretty much a constant stream of drug use just about every day.

00:50:25.469 --> 00:50:34.469
Sometimes I knew what drugs I was using and sometimes I didn't because other people would give them to me and I would accept that.

00:50:34.469 --> 00:50:43.469
Drugs led to a lot of immorality and my sense of what was right and what was wrong was really affected.

00:50:43.469 --> 00:50:48.469
And I just didn't care anymore. I didn't care what people thought.

00:50:48.469 --> 00:51:00.469
I didn't care if something was a sin. I did whatever I wanted to do. And with whoever I wanted to be involved with.

00:51:00.469 --> 00:51:08.469
One night a friend of mine asked me about my lifestyle and what kind of future could I foresee for myself living the way I was living.

00:51:08.469 --> 00:51:17.469
And he told me that he used to study the Bible. I gave that little bit of thought and I went out and bought a Bible for myself and I started to read it.

00:51:17.469 --> 00:51:29.469
What really hit me the hardest I think was when I prayed and realized that God heard my prayer in spite of the fact that I had so turned my back on him in the past.

00:51:29.469 --> 00:51:33.469
But when I was ready to come back to him, he was ready to have me.

00:51:33.469 --> 00:51:41.469
On July the 10th, 1973, this friend of mine asked me if I would marry him.

00:51:41.469 --> 00:51:52.469
And I said yes. And he'd been studying with the witnesses. So he also asked me if I would go to the kingdom hall with him. And I said yes to that too.

00:51:52.469 --> 00:52:01.469
After the meeting, a couple invited us to have a Bible study with them. And that night I took the book, the truth that leads to eternal life.

00:52:01.469 --> 00:52:09.849
And I read that book from one end of it to the other end. And I knew that I had found the truth.

00:52:09.849 --> 00:52:15.849
That very same day, I immediately started making changes in my life.

00:52:15.849 --> 00:52:26.849
Both Harry and I knew that this had to be all or nothing. And within that same year, both of us were baptized as Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:52:26.849 --> 00:52:41.849
41 years, Harry and I have been happily serving Jehovah together. And we're so grateful to Jehovah that he gives us the help that we need to keep our marriage happy for all these many years.

00:52:41.849 --> 00:52:52.849
Another great blessing we have is that our two wonderful girls have been able to avoid falling into some of these pitfalls that I experienced.

00:52:52.849 --> 00:53:00.849
And the reason why is because they were raised according to Bible standards that were taught to us by Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:53:00.849 --> 00:53:13.849
Almost every year for the last 20 years, Harry and I have been able to travel, to remote areas to help different congregations and bringing the message of God's kingdom to people.

00:53:13.849 --> 00:53:25.849
Along the way, we made many true lasting friendships and what a contrast this is with the people that we used to protest with.

00:53:25.849 --> 00:53:33.849
I know that I owe all of this to my loving father in heaven, Jehovah.

00:53:33.849 --> 00:53:48.849
And I would hope that everybody who's possibly has experienced some of the things that I've gone through in my life would give the Bible a chance to be able to help them the way that it's been able to help me.

00:53:55.829 --> 00:54:08.829
Yes, the truth transformed Sister Simon's life. And when we as a group come together each year for our assemblies and conventions, we see another aspect of how the truth transformed our lives.

00:54:08.829 --> 00:54:19.829
It's really the truth that unites us together. In a couple of months, conventions will be held in many parts of the world and will continue through the end of this calendar year.

00:54:19.829 --> 00:54:25.829
With that in mind, we would now like to share some experiences from last year's conventions.

00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:34.579
This is a report that was recently given here at Bethel by a member of the Central Europe Branch Committee.

00:54:34.579 --> 00:54:40.579
One of the outstanding highlights of the 2014 service year in the Central Europe branch.

00:54:40.579 --> 00:54:45.579
By the way, that's Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Lichtenstein and Luxembourg.

00:54:45.579 --> 00:54:53.579
So one of the highlights was certainly the international convention held in July in Frankfurt.

00:54:53.579 --> 00:55:03.579
This convention hosted about 35,000 brothers and sisters, included 3,000 delegates from all over the world, perhaps even some of you.

00:55:03.579 --> 00:55:14.579
In total, more than 230,000 attendees enjoyed the program at various locations in the whole branch territory at the same weekend.

00:55:14.579 --> 00:55:21.579
And almost 1,500 got peptized at that special weekend.

00:55:21.579 --> 00:55:26.579
Local brothers as well as many delegates had wonderful experiences.

00:55:26.579 --> 00:55:32.579
There is, for example, the Indian cap driver in Frankfurt. Yes, in Frankfurt.

00:55:32.579 --> 00:55:40.579
He took a group of delegates from Australia and from Slovakia and his taxi and they got into a friendly conversation.

00:55:40.579 --> 00:55:53.579
And as he recognized their batches, they had the opportunity to give a brief witness and they had the chance to explain how the convention was all about.

00:55:53.579 --> 00:55:59.579
And how the Bible had united people of all backgrounds to come together in peace.

00:55:59.579 --> 00:56:07.579
As they reached their destination, the taxi driver refused to accept any money of them.

00:56:07.579 --> 00:56:15.579
He insisted not to charge them and said, this morning I took some of your people to the convention and I didn't charge them.

00:56:15.579 --> 00:56:18.579
And I don't want to charge you.

00:56:18.579 --> 00:56:24.579
You people are doing a holy work and for this reason I won't charge you.

00:56:24.579 --> 00:56:30.579
At least they could give him something far more worthy than money they gave him a tract.

00:56:30.579 --> 00:56:34.579
And Jehovah knows what effect this will have on him.

00:56:34.579 --> 00:56:40.579
Another very encouraging but somewhat bizarre situation to place in a hotel in Frankfurt.

00:56:40.579 --> 00:56:54.579
A couple who visited as delegates from the US, rehearsed their German field service presentation in the lobby of the hotel just before going out to preach with the local brothers.

00:56:54.579 --> 00:57:04.579
Interestingly, they attracted the attention of the hotel manager who asked what they were doing. So they explained him what they are doing.

00:57:04.579 --> 00:57:15.579
Surprisingly, the manager offered to serve himself as a sort of crash test dummy so that they could try their presentation on him.

00:57:15.579 --> 00:57:21.579
The couple accepted the offer and tried their German field service presentation on the manager.

00:57:21.579 --> 00:57:30.579
To the joy of our couple, he took time to coach them still with some fine tuning on their German grammar and pronunciation.

00:57:30.579 --> 00:57:39.579
And as the couple thought everything was said and done, the manager asked, don't you normally offer some magazines?

00:57:39.579 --> 00:57:46.579
And the couple said yes, and then the manager said, and why don't you offer them to me? I would love to take them.

00:57:46.579 --> 00:57:52.579
You can imagine how surprised the couple wasn't, of course, the manager got his magazines.

00:57:52.579 --> 00:58:01.579
As you can see, that convention had really a great impact not only on the brotherhood, but as well on the outsiders.

00:58:01.579 --> 00:58:06.579
Besides that convention highlight, there is another very encouraging development in our branch territory.

00:58:06.579 --> 00:58:12.579
It's the continuous increase of regular pioneers in the last years, just a few facts.

00:58:12.579 --> 00:58:24.579
In 2004, we had about 7,400 regular pioneers, and this number increased to 11,500 until now.

00:58:24.579 --> 00:58:41.579
Today, already 870 regular pioneers have been appointed for the 2015 service year only in Germany and 1554 in our whole branch territory.

00:58:41.579 --> 00:58:53.579
Among them, there are many couples, and it is very encouraging to see how more and more publishers in our quite wealthy country set the kingdom on first place in their lives.

00:58:54.579 --> 00:59:09.579
We also see a lot of growth in the foreign language territory. Currently, of the about 210,000 publishers in our branch territory, almost 50,000 work in the foreign language field.

00:59:10.579 --> 00:59:25.579
During the 2014 service year, 1717 foreign language congregations were formed, plus 63 groups, plus 54 pre-groups.

00:59:25.579 --> 00:59:43.579
An amazing number of 1216 got baptized at foreign language assemblies and conventions in the last service year in language fields such as Romanian, Bulgarian, Persian, Tigrinia, Turkish, Chinese, and many others.

00:59:43.579 --> 00:59:57.579
We are convinced that these developments are another evidence that God's kingdom rules, and this motivates us all to do our very best to be fellow workers of Jehovah.

00:59:57.579 --> 01:00:11.309
It's our prayer that we get to enjoy similar experiences during this upcoming convention season, but what is really involved in being a fellow worker for Jehovah, as Brother Fiala mentioned?

01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:21.309
The answer is found in Matthew 633, which says, keep on then seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness.

01:00:21.309 --> 01:00:34.559
In this beautiful music video, you will see examples of how we can seek first the kingdom. The song is called What Means The Most To Me.

01:00:34.559 --> 01:01:09.900
But are the things that I found, the things that mean the most to me, things that will help me to be, to be the person I want to be.

01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:28.570
With each new day, there are choices to be made. Sometimes the choice will need to be a trend. The time I have can never be replayed.

01:01:28.570 --> 01:01:50.539
The steps I take can never be retrained. That's why I want to choose carefully, and choose what really means the most to me.

01:01:50.539 --> 01:02:36.250
The prophetic word is being fulfilled in front of our eyes as the preaching work is speeding up more and more.

01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:46.250
And the examples in the video highlighted some of the obstacles we may face, be it higher education, a secular career or something else.

01:02:46.250 --> 01:02:57.250
But if we handle it with wisdom, it can enable us to continue speaking about the magnificent things of God and thus be part of fulfilling the prophetic word.

01:02:57.250 --> 01:03:03.250
To conclude our program, we would like to take you briefly to the Mexico branch.

01:03:03.250 --> 01:03:13.250
Yes, in connection with the International Convention in Mexico City in October last year, a display was opened in the primary building that's called Caleb's Corner.

01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:21.250
Their children can do preaching reenactments, they can take pictures with Caleb and Sofia and watch videos from the animated series.

01:03:21.250 --> 01:03:31.500
Many of the approximately 10,000 people that come to visit the branch each month have expressed their appreciation for this display.

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:35.500
Thank you brothers and sisters for joining us this month.

01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:40.500
This is JW Broadcasting from Brooklyn, New York.
