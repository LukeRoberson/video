00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.380
My name is Massimo Cristarelli.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.380
Well, I have a degree in electronic engineering

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.379
and then I have a PhD in robotics and computer science.

00:00:17.379 --> 00:00:20.379
I believe in evolution because when I was studying,

00:00:20.379 --> 00:00:24.379
it was taken for granted in the school and all the teachings.

00:00:24.379 --> 00:00:29.379
So I thought that the proofs that were given were really

00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:32.380
substantiated by physical measures.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.380
In my field of science is computer vision.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:42.380
What I try to do is to design machines based on computers.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.380
They try to replicate the perceptual ability of a human visual system.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.380
They can identify people from their faces.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.380
If their expression doesn't change too much,

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.380
if there is not too much makeup and so on.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.380
But let's look at what a human does.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.380
A human can recognize faces since a few hours after birth

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.379
and can do very precisely, very fast.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.379
And in any different condition, you know,

00:01:07.379 --> 00:01:12.379
regardless of the age or facial expressions or environment or whatever.

00:01:12.379 --> 00:01:16.379
I've given always science first place.

00:01:16.379 --> 00:01:20.379
Everything that was based on proof

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:23.379
and based on science was most important.

00:01:23.379 --> 00:01:26.379
The reason why I started to question my belief in evolution

00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:29.379
is because I discovered that what I was taught

00:01:29.379 --> 00:01:33.379
was not really based on real proof.

00:01:33.379 --> 00:01:36.379
But it was mostly based on some theories

00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:40.379
that were on interpolation more than or real measurements.

00:01:40.379 --> 00:01:43.379
The complexity of nature, to me,

00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:49.379
is a clear evidence of a need or existence of a designer.

00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:54.379
I don't know any complex mechanism or device

00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:59.379
which has been conceived by humans, by engineers.

00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:02.379
That was not made by a designer.
