00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:06.139
The lion's fearless reputation is well-founded.

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:11.140
Lions are Africa's largest native cat.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:18.699
A full-grown male can weigh up to 230 kilograms or about 500 pounds.

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:25.699
Females are smaller but can still weigh up to 180 kilograms or nearly 400 pounds.

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:32.780
Lions successfully hunt animals as large as buffaloes and hippos.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.899
Lines are the only cats that live together in social groups.

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:48.899
These groups call prides normally consist of related females and their cubs along with a small number of resident males.

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.399
Healthy adult lions have no natural predators.

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:59.399
However, lions face a threat from a surprising source.

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.399
What is it?

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.159
Other lions.

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.159
Lions are territorial.

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:14.299
They will attack and kill other lions in an attempt to take over their hunting territory.

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.299
Lion cubs face another danger.

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.299
Groups of rival males will attempt to drive off the resident males and take over the pride.

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:31.299
If the invading males are successful, they will try to kill the cubs that were fathered by other lions.

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.299
The invading males can then father cubs of their own.

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.299
On their own, the tiny cubs would be defenseless.

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.299
But lions vigorously defend their cubs.

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:49.299
Both males and females protect the pride from other lions.

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:57.299
A mother lion will defend her cubs even though she may be injured or killed by a larger invading male.

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:04.299
Several mothers may defend their cubs collectively, giving the cubs a better chance of survival.

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:13.240
Horses were often used in ancient battles.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.240
A charging horse was a powerful weapon.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.240
The mere presence of cavalry or chariots on the battlefield was intimidating to opposing armies.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:29.240
However, horses needed training to be effective in battle.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.240
Horses are not naturally courageous.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.240
Without proper training, a horse could be a liability on the battlefield.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.240
Why?

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:46.969
Because of their keen eyesight and hearing, horses easily become startled.

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:51.969
Horses have nearly a 360-degree range of vision.

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:56.969
Ancient battlefields were filled with sights that tended to terrify horses.

00:02:56.969 --> 00:03:02.969
For this reason, ancient warriors sometimes put blinders on horses.

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:07.969
Horses have 16 muscles that control each of their ears.

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:11.969
They can move their ears to hear sounds more clearly.

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:16.969
A horse can hear the sound of danger before a human.

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:22.969
The possibility of horses panicking in battle was a constant danger.

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:28.969
Ancient armies would deliberately try to frighten their enemy's horses to induce chaos.

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:32.969
How was a horse trained for battle?

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:39.969
Their trainers exposed the horse to sights and sounds similar to those encountered on the battlefield.

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:44.969
Gradually, the horse would overcome its fear.

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:48.969
When trained properly, instead of fleeing at the sound of battle,

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:53.969
a courageous warhorse would excitedly run towards it.

00:03:53.969 --> 00:04:07.349
Across southern Asia, lives a small mammal that is surprisingly fearless.

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.349
The Indian Grey Mungus.

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:20.350
This furry creature is relatively small, typically measuring less than a meter or three feet in length from head to tail.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:26.350
Despite its small size, the Mungus is in fact a bold predator.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:32.350
It feeds on various small creatures, but the most famous of its prey are venomous snakes,

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.350
such as the King Cobra.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:44.350
Several species of Mungus, including the Indian Grey Mungus, are known for their ability to kill venomous snakes.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.350
What protects the Mungus as it fights a venomous snake?

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:55.350
The Indian Grey Mungus' thick fur is composed of stiff hairs that stand direct when the Mungus is excited or angry.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:02.350
This fur serves as a protective layer to prevent a snake from biting into its flesh.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:10.350
However, if it is bitten, the Mungus has an internal defense mechanism, a tolerance to snake venom.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.350
The Mungus is amazingly fast and agile.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:20.350
When the snake strikes, the Mungus swiftly moves out of the way and avoids the bites.

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.350
The Mungus also possesses incredible stamina.

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.350
It can keep fighting until the snake tires out.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:34.350
When the Mungus makes its final attack, it strikes the snake at just the right location to kill it.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:46.160
The Mungus is in doubt with defenses and abilities that enable it to fearlessly fight and defeat the snake.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:53.160
Found only in North and South America, hummingbirds are among the smallest of all birds.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:08.160
Although the more than 300 species of hummingbirds vary in size, most species are between 6 and 12 centimeters or 2.4 and 4.7 inches in length.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:14.160
To the human eye, the beating of a hummingbird's wings is just a blur.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:21.160
Because its wingbeat is so rapid, this tiny bird generates a humming noise as it flies.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.160
The smaller the hummingbird, the faster its wingbeat.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:31.160
Large hummingbirds beat their wings around 10 to 20 times per second.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:38.160
Smaller hummingbirds may beat their wings 70 or 80 times per second in normal flight.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:50.160
Hummingbirds can fly forward and backward, sideways, straight up and down and for brief periods, even upside down.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:56.160
They hover in place as they feed on flower nectar.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:02.160
But these beautiful little birds do not have charming temperaments.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:11.160
Hummingbirds aggressively defend desirable sources of nectar attempting to drive off other hummingbirds that invade their feeding territory.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.160
Females defend their nests.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:24.160
Especially during mating season, males of most hummingbird species defend their breeding territory.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:33.160
Because of their agility and flight, hummingbirds can chase away much larger birds such as crows and hawks.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.160
They will even dive at humans.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:53.259
Despite their tiny size, hummingbirds are ready to defend themselves and the things that are essential for their survival.

00:07:53.259 --> 00:07:58.540
A herd of African elephants is an impressive sight.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:05.779
An elephant family group consists of related adult females and their young.

00:08:05.779 --> 00:08:10.779
The close-knit family group provides support to its members.

00:08:11.779 --> 00:08:16.779
Elephants have excellent memory and this strengthens their social bonds.

00:08:16.779 --> 00:08:24.029
They recognize and remember one another, even after long periods of separation.

00:08:24.029 --> 00:08:36.029
When a young elephant is in distress, older elephants reassure and comfort the young one by coming near and touching it with their body or trunk.

00:08:36.029 --> 00:08:44.029
If an elephant is weak or injured, other elephants may attempt to help it to its feet and assist it to stand.

00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:56.379
From the older members of the family group, young elephants learn vital survival skills, including how to find food and water.

00:08:56.379 --> 00:09:04.379
To find water in times of droughts, the herd may need to travel great distances.

00:09:05.379 --> 00:09:11.379
The older elephants lead the way, helping younger ones make the trip.

00:09:11.379 --> 00:09:15.379
How do the elephants know where to go?

00:09:15.379 --> 00:09:24.379
Old elephants remember for decades where water can be found, even locations hundreds of miles away.

00:09:24.379 --> 00:09:29.379
They teach these locations to the younger generation.

00:09:29.379 --> 00:09:34.379
The family group also provides protection from predators.

00:09:34.379 --> 00:09:41.379
An elephant may charge an attacker and use its tusks, trunk and feet as weapons.

00:09:41.379 --> 00:09:49.850
To protect the calves, adults encircle, standing between them and the predators.

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:59.850
If a member of the herd is seriously wounded, other elephants, including young ones, may courageously come to its defence.
