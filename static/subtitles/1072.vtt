00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:12.009
Have you ever stood on the ocean shore enjoying the salt spray watching the breakers dash against the rocks or run up onto the sandy beach in them withdrawal?

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:20.129
Many enjoy spending hours at the ocean. We never stop marveling at its beauty and its immense size.

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:26.250
On the other hand, many fear the destructive power of the ocean.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.530
Like other natural forces, the ocean can act like a powerful giant that sometimes goes on a rampage.

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:40.570
What can man do to stop the wall of water of a tsunami from approaching the coastline?

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:52.250
The power of storm waves is almost unbelievable. They have been known to throw boulders weighing 7,000 pounds over a wall 20 feet high.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:01.250
Can we trust that Jehovah, in the future, will bring the ocean and other natural forces into perfect balance?

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.250
In the following video, note how the oceans give loud and clear evidence of Job's wisdom and power.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:18.709
Millions of cubic meters of water circulates continually around our planet.

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:55.109
Near the poles, water that is colder, saltier and denser sinks, creating a flow almost 100 times that of the Amazon River.

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:07.109
This drives a massive circulation of water that may take 1,000 years to complete the global ocean conveyor belt.

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:29.669
This enormous system distributes heat which helps to stabilize the weather and transports great quantities of nutrients around the world.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.020
So that life may flourish in abundance.

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:59.099
Jehovah set these mechanisms in motion and understands them perfectly.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:08.110
You rule over the raging of the sea when its waves surge you come.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.240
On our video, the oceans are essential to sustain life on the earth.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.240
Sadly, however, greedy men have trashed them with pollution.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.240
Global warming has caused ocean levels to rise, threatening coastal areas.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:39.240
Experts are concerned that the natural forces are so out of balance that soon the planet will no longer sustain life.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:55.240
Yet, friends, if Jehovah had the wisdom and power to create the earth's oceans, when his time comes to bring all natural forces back into perfect balance, he can certainly cause us to live in harmony with them.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:04.240
Though the oceans might appear to be uncontrollable, we know that Jehovah is vastly more powerful.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.240
Note how Psalm 93-4 describes his power.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.240
Psalm 93-4.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:23.240
Above the sound of many waters, mightier than the breaking waves of the sea, Jehovah is majestic in the heights.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:32.240
Yes, the great sea may lift up its powerful waves to heaven, but it is no match for our majestic Almighty God.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:45.620
Jehovah's powerful ability to perfectly control the oceans gives us great confidence that he is also perfectly capable of protecting us, his people.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:54.620
In Jeremiah 5-22, notice how Jehovah reminds his people of his power.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.620
Jeremiah 5-22.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:09.620
Do you not fear me, Jehovah? Should you not tremble before me? It is I who place the sand as the boundary for the sea.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:23.620
A permanent regulation that it cannot pass over, although its waves toss, they cannot prevail, although they roar, they still cannot pass beyond it.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:36.620
Yes, Almighty God placed the sand as the boundary for the sea, so when its furious waves pound against sand, the sand absorbs their impact and the force vanishes.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:51.620
Since Jehovah controls the literal roaring sea from going beyond his boundaries, can he not also protect his people when the wicked sea of humanity threatens us with his violent storms?

00:05:52.620 --> 00:06:03.620
Jehovah's control over vast waters was well demonstrated when he protected the Israelites by allowing them to cross the Red Sea on dry land.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:18.620
Now the Red Sea has an average depth of over 1,600 feet. It is estimated that at the point where the Israelites crossed it, the depth of the sea was as much as 50 feet.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:29.620
Imagine being in an Israelite, walking through this corridor with walls of water on each side of you, some 50 feet high.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:45.620
And then, Jehovah used those same walls of water to collapse, drowning their enemies, the Egyptians. Yes, Jehovah controlled those vast waters to deliver an entire nation from a world power.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:57.620
And do you recall the account in Mark chapter 4 verses 37 to 39 when God empowered his son Jesus to control the sea and the wind?

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:09.620
When Jesus and the disciples were crossing the sea of Galilee in a boat, a great wind storm caused the sea to rage and it threatened to fill up their boat.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:21.620
What did Jesus do? He commanded the wind and the sea with the words hush, be quiet and the raging wind and sea calm down.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:35.620
So on this occasion, Jesus showed what He will do as King of God's kingdom during the millennium. He will control forces of nature. There will be no need to fear the ocean.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:52.620
In recent years, disastrous storms are becoming more frequent and severe. What used to be considered extreme, massive floods, killer droughts and monsters, no storms is the new normal.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:59.620
Many experts now put the blame on human activity that has affected the oceans and the climate.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:06.620
So yes, men continue to ruin their today, but here's the good news.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:14.620
During the millennium, by means of his kingdom, our wise creator will undo all the damage done by humans.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:23.620
Everything will function in harmony with Jehovah's principles. And we will learn how to properly care for this beautiful planet.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:32.620
And as we do, everything will be brought back into proper balance, including the climate and the oceans.

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:45.620
While some men today fear that the earth will be destroyed due to man's abuse, Jehovah gives us this comforting promise at Psalm 104 and verse 5.

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.620
Psalm 104 and verse 5.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:09:00.860
He has established the earth on his foundations. It will not be moved from its place forever and ever.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:14.860
Yes, the beautiful deep and dark blue ocean will roll on forever. The creator will make sure that by observing the oceans, meditating on what we see.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:22.860
We can build our faith that soon we will enjoy Jehovah's creation forever without fear.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:34.860
Brother James Mance, a helper to the writing committee, will now present the next talk of this symposium. Use creation to build your faith for us.
