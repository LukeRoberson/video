00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:08.740
Over the years, the number of popular songs have romanticized divorce.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:15.580
But anyone who has personally experienced the pain and trauma associated with divorce

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.660
knows that it couldn't have been part of Jehovah's original purpose.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:28.539
And in fact, the scriptures indicate that when Jehovah performed the first marriage of

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:33.740
Adam and Eve, he intended for it to be a permanent arrangement.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:41.219
After all, it was a match made in heaven, so to speak, Jehovah created the man, and then

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.859
he created the perfect complement, Eve.

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:52.340
And had they been obedient, Adam and Eve would be married today.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:59.060
But with their disobedience came a whole range of serious problems, and they impacted the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.340
marriage arrangement in what way.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:11.099
Well with imperfection came sin, and then death and death ends a marriage.

00:01:11.099 --> 00:01:15.420
That's something Jehovah never had in mind.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.540
And further indicating the complications and negative effects of imperfection on marriage

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:30.379
is the provision for divorce found in the Mosaic Law in Deuteronomy chapter 24 verse 1.

00:01:30.379 --> 00:01:32.620
So here's a question.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.700
Did the fact that Jehovah made a provision for divorce in the Mosaic Law indicate that

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:45.180
he was relaxing his view or that he had changed his thinking on marriage?

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:53.260
Well his words as recorded in Malachi chapter 2 verse 16, more than 1000 years after the

00:01:53.260 --> 00:02:00.659
words recorded in Deuteronomy 24, we find that Jehovah has not changed his thinking.

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:06.500
He stated very simply, I hate divorce.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.939
Now what was the situation in Malachi's day?

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:18.219
The provision for divorce had been distorted and abused, and men were divorcing their wives

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:25.259
on every sort of grounds, resulting in heartbreak, and also in reproach on Jehovah's

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:27.639
name.

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:30.360
I hate divorce.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.960
We can see why Jehovah would have said those words.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.879
Had the situation improved any by the time of Jesus' earthly ministry, and the scriptures

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:48.719
indicate not, and interestingly the secular historian Josephus indicates that men could

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:56.759
divorce their wives on any basis whatsoever, and they did.

00:02:56.759 --> 00:03:03.080
So true to form, Jesus forthrightly addressed the subject at least twice in the course

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.800
of his earthly ministry as recorded in the scriptures.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:14.159
The first occasion took place in the year 31 CE sometime after Passover.

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:20.479
Jesus' words recorded in the sermon on the mount, and there he said everyone who divorces

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:30.120
his wife, except on the grounds of sexual immorality, and Mary's another, commits adultery.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.280
Jesus was raising the barher.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:41.919
Actually when you think about it, under the Mosaic law, sexual immorality, adultery, was

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:47.319
a capital offense that would have brought death.

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:55.400
So the fact that Jesus said sexual immorality is the only basis for divorce, helps us to

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.039
appreciate how seriously he and his father view the marriage arrangement.

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:08.479
Now the second occasion in which Jesus addressed the subject came more than a year later,

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:14.919
late in the year 32 CE, and that's the account that we read about in today's text.

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:20.920
The parallel account in Mark chapter 10 shares some additional insight, and we want to take

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:27.839
just a few minutes this morning and analyze Jesus' words in Mark chapter 10 beginning

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:37.740
in verse 2, so we invite you to turn there.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:46.100
In Mark chapter 10 verse 2, the Pharisees approached intent on testing Jesus, and they asked whether

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.300
it was lawful for a man to divorce a wife.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:58.579
So now the Pharisees are introducing the thought of the law, but Mark reveals that Jesus directed

00:04:58.579 --> 00:05:02.420
attention specifically to the Mosaic law.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.860
What did Moses command you?

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.779
The Pharisees said Moses allowed the writing of a certificate of dismissal and divorcing

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:20.139
her, so they conveniently remembered the certificate of dismissal part, but they forgot

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:26.939
that divorce was allowed only for very serious matters.

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:32.339
And Matthew's account indicates that by Jesus' day they were divorcing on every sort

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:34.339
of ground.

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:37.220
So how did Jesus address this?

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:42.939
Well he said to them in verse 5, out of regard for your hardheartedness, he wrote this commandment

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:50.259
for you, however, from the beginning of creation, and then you'll notice a quotation

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:58.540
in Mark, so Jesus is now quoting from the Genesis account, he made them male and female,

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.259
Genesis 1, 27.

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:08.740
For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother, and the two will be one flush,

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:20.310
Genesis 2, 24, end quote, and then Jesus adds so that they are no longer two but one flush.

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:31.490
Therefore what God has yoked to gather let no man put apart, well the disciples were

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:37.610
impressed by this very high standard that Jesus was explaining.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:43.870
When they were again in the house they began to question him about this, and Jesus again

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.410
forthrightly makes the point.

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:52.529
He said to them, whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against

00:06:52.529 --> 00:07:01.660
her, and if ever a woman after divorcing her husband marries another she commits adultery.

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:12.819
Why do you think Jesus might have insisted that the Pharisees focus on Moses' words?

00:07:12.819 --> 00:07:17.660
Well it certainly provided him an opportunity to clarify the matter, didn't it?

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:25.060
And to restate Jehovah's thinking on the sacredness of marriage.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:33.660
And Jesus added these words, what God has yoked to gather, let no man put apart.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:41.259
So Jehovah is personally interested in each marriage, and that elevates the relationship

00:07:41.259 --> 00:07:44.339
as well, doesn't it?

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:51.100
So what can you and I learn from Jesus' words that will help us if we're married or if

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:55.019
we're single and contemplating marriage?

00:07:55.019 --> 00:07:57.939
Here are two points.

00:07:57.939 --> 00:08:06.579
Jesus made very clear that his followers would be elevated and hold to Jehovah's original

00:08:06.579 --> 00:08:16.220
standard for marriage, not the corrupted standard that the Jewish religious leaders promoted.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:23.860
And by introducing this thought that Jehovah is involved, he helped us to see the seriousness

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:26.540
of the situation.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:32.860
And the Apostle Paul and his letter to the Ephesians confirmed that Christians would hold to

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:38.580
Jehovah's original standard for a man and a wife.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:46.820
And that the only valid basis for a scriptural divorce would be sexual immorality.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:56.019
Here's a second point, Jesus put Christian men and women on equal footing morally speaking.

00:08:56.019 --> 00:09:04.460
Both husband and wife would be responsible for protecting their marriage and for upholding

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:08.500
the sanctity of marriage.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:14.460
And we find Jesus' words in Mark 1012 interesting as well.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:21.700
If ever a woman after divorcing her husband marries another, she commits adultery.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:32.340
But Jesus makes clear that a faithful servant of God who is a woman can divorce an adulterous

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.460
husband.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:40.940
That would have been food for thought for Jewish men and women in Jesus' day.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:47.100
How we appreciate Jesus' view and Jehovah's view of marriage, here at Bethel we have many

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.220
married couples.

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:56.779
And in the congregations around the earth, faithful men and women who respect and cherish

00:09:56.779 --> 00:09:59.580
the sanctity of marriage.

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:07.659
And we're so glad for that and determined whether married or single to uphold Jehovah's

00:10:07.659 --> 00:10:11.259
view of the sacred marriage arrangement.
