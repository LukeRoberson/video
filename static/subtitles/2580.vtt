00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:16.570
King David was determined to have a share in building a temple that would praise Jehovah.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.570
At 1 Chronicles 22 verse 7, he told his son Solomon,

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.850
It was my heart's desire to build a house for the name of Jehovah, my God.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.609
If David were alive today, how would he feel about the great building work that is taking

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.210
place in God's organization right now?

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.409
We have thousands of kingdom halls and assembly halls around the world, and thousands more

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:42.130
are needed.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.649
Hundreds of thousands of volunteers each year share in buying, designing, building, and

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:50.409
maintaining these facilities.

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:55.729
Like David, sharing in this work makes them happy because it is their heart's desire

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:57.729
to praise Jehovah.

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:00.770
Would you like to have a share?

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.090
Learning for the LDC program is not just for young men.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:10.090
Older ones, single sisters, and young ones too are volunteering.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.530
Good health is a prerequisite for working on a construction site, but many older ones

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.650
are having a share in this work as consultants, trainers, and remote volunteers.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.849
I do remote work for local design constructions design group in Korea.

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:32.409
I mainly participate in reviewing design drawings created by the brothers and sisters.

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.810
I'm also asked for opinions regarding suitable materials, relevant regulations, and other

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.170
design-related matter.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.609
Then I do research on the work that is scheduled.

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:48.329
When I delivered the organized materials and they tell me it was actually helpful, I feel

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.969
the joy of working together with them as a team.

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:57.250
I'm working as a consultant to the design team in New Zealand.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:04.650
There are many young brothers and sisters, and they are hungry to learn, they're humble,

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.009
and they have so much potential.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:14.849
If experienced brothers and sisters make themselves available, they will enjoy the reward of serving

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.289
as part of Jehovah's team regardless of age.

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:24.930
Jehovah takes a personal interest in all of his servants, including older ones.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.610
It is encouraging to know that as we get older, he still has work for us to do.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.250
Jehovah also takes an interest in single sisters.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.289
As a team, I took part in the monthly Kingdom Hall maintenance work.

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:42.650
When I saw the joy of our brothers and sisters in the construction work in the videos at

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.969
the meetings, and on JW Broadcasting, I decided I wanted to be part of the construction

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:49.250
work too.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.889
Although I didn't have any technical skills in the construction field, the overseer and

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:58.050
many brothers and sisters provided training while we worked together.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.370
They taught me everything from how to read blueprints, to how to perform plumbing installations,

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.289
and I even learned complex skills related to air conditioning.

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:08.289
I received a lot of training.

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:11.889
Yeah, the brothers have been really patient with me, giving me so much direction.

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:14.930
I've learned a lot, both on-site, learning different trades.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.210
Yeah, I really taught me that Jehovah can make the willing able.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:23.449
We moved down to everything months, moved congregations every three months, but it just helps

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:26.009
to spread to family just to keep getting bigger and bigger.

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:29.370
It's like working in a little spiritual paradise.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.849
Zellas single sisters have a place in God's organization.

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:39.490
Jehovah has extended a personal invitation to everyone to be active in his congregation

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:40.969
today.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.770
These are required to accompany their minor children who are approved to volunteer.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.569
But what about younger ones who are not yet old enough to volunteer on their own?

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:52.729
Can you also have a share?

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:54.729
You certainly can.

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:59.530
The maintenance trainer encouraged me by commending me for using my time and helping

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.370
maintain the Gingro.

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.449
And this really stuck with me because it showed me that if I continue to do that, I'm

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:07.810
making the best use of my time.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.050
The brother, he showed me how to do it first.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.330
On the second try, we both did it together, and then on the third, he let me do it by

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.330
myself.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.970
Well, there was an elder, and he used a little booklet to teach us which colored cloth would

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.449
be used for a specific job.

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:28.490
Every time I participate in Kingdom Hall cleaning, it's a step closer to when I can do more

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.490
for Jehovah.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.329
Well, sometimes still young, there's many things I can't do.

00:04:33.329 --> 00:04:39.529
So when I clean, I feel that I can contribute to the congregation and praise Jehovah.

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:45.129
Young ones, more than anything, spiritual qualities will help you to make your future happy and

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:46.129
successful.

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:50.850
Jehovah is pleased to use you if you have a humble, willing spirit.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:56.649
So along with your parents, look for things you can do in your congregation, such as helping

00:04:56.649 --> 00:04:59.529
to clean and maintain the Kingdom Hall.

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:04.610
Helping and maintaining places of worship calls for volunteers who have the necessary experience

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.170
to complete these projects.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.449
But volunteers who are willing to be trained are also needed.

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:14.370
Can you make yourself available?

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.449
If so, now is the time to approach your congregation elders.

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:23.850
Ask them how you can qualify and how to apply.

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.529
Make it a matter of prayer.

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:32.970
You too may develop a heart's desire to build facilities to the glory of Jehovah's

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:33.370
name.
