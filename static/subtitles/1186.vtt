00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.669
Everything on Earth is made from fewer than 100 naturally occurring elements,

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:19.300
such as oxygen, carbon, calcium and iron.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.300
How are such elements formed?

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.789
Many are created inside of stars,

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.789
where tremendous heat and pressure cause atoms to fuse together.

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.789
Stars like our sun fuse hydrogen, the lightest element,

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:40.100
to form helium, a heavier element.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.100
Helium fuses to make carbon.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.100
As the star progressively forms heavier elements, it becomes larger.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.829
Its core becomes hotter and denser.

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.829
Eventually, the core collapses on itself,

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.829
and the star explodes, becoming a supernova.

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.829
A supernova forms even heavier elements

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:09.909
and shoots them into space.

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.909
The Bible does not describe exactly how Jehovah formed the Earth,

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:20.420
but Jehovah ensured that Earth contains all of the elements needed for life.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:35.420
Nice to see your heavens, the works of your fingers,

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.420
the moon and the stars that you have prepared.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.420
What is mortal man that you keep him in mind,

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:52.609
and a son of man that you take care of him?

00:01:52.609 --> 00:02:00.359
The atmosphere, one of Earth's amazing life support systems.

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:05.700
Its mix of gases sustains life.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:21.520
It insulates the Earth and prevents temperature extremes that could destroy life.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:28.520
It protects against most life-threatening radiation and objects from space.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.520
Living things both depend on the atmosphere and contribute to it.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.830
When people and animals breathe, they absorb oxygen

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.830
and put carbon dioxide back into the air.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:49.389
Plants absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen.

00:02:49.389 --> 00:03:02.439
Non-living systems also help to renew and to protect the atmosphere.

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:10.439
Carbon dioxide trapped in rocks is recycled into the air when volcanoes erupt.

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:15.439
Earth's gravity holds the atmosphere close to the surface

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:27.050
and its magnetic field may prevent solar winds from eroding the atmosphere into space.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.050
The Earth, a well-supplied and well-protected home,

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:38.060
is indeed a loving gift.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.060
As for the heavens, they belong to Jehovah,

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.060
but the Earth he has given to the sons of men.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:56.490
Of all plant life on Earth, the most abundant is grass.

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:06.740
Found on every continent, it covers more than one-third of the planet.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:30.040
Grass serves as food. Nearly 70% of all agricultural land grows grass crops.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:53.769
Grass provides shelter. Bamboo, a type of grass, can grow taller than 40 meters or 131 feet.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:02.899
This makes it a popular building material. Grass can be clothing.

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:11.420
It's in our lives almost every day.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:16.420
Grass is just one of many plants that Jehovah created to meet our needs.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:27.720
These are mentioned by name at Genesis 1, verse 12.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.720
And the Earth began to produce grass, seed-bearing plants,

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.720
and trees yielding fruit along with seed according to their kinds.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:47.800
Then God saw that it was good.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:55.800
Temperatures in the Arctic can drop to minus 50 degrees Celsius or minus 58 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:06.370
The polar bear, however, maintains its body temperature at around 37 degrees Celsius or 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.370
It is a marvel of thermal engineering.

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:17.370
The transparent hairs of a polar bear scatter the sun's visible light, making them a pure white.

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.370
Ultraviolet rays are trapped in the fur.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:27.370
The bear's black skin helps it to absorb that captured heat.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:41.779
Oils in its fur also help to keep the bear warm and dry from extreme temperatures, extreme deaths.

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:59.519
The Mariana trench in the Pacific is deeper than Earth's tallest mountains.

00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:09.370
Creature survive here despite perpetual darkness and the crushing weight of the waters.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:22.600
Fish living in extreme depths have a highly concentrated chemical in their cells that keeps proteins and membranes working properly.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:31.759
God has marvelously equipped these and other animals.

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:35.759
What does this say about our own value in God's eyes?

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:41.139
Observe intently the birds of heaven.

00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:48.139
They do not so seed or reap or gather into storehouses, yet your heavenly father feeds them.

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:57.339
Are you not worth more than they are?

00:07:57.339 --> 00:08:02.339
From the moment we are born, we experience the world through our senses.

00:08:02.339 --> 00:08:08.939
Touch, let's us feel safe and loved.

00:08:08.939 --> 00:08:17.569
We use it to explore and learn.

00:08:17.569 --> 00:08:21.569
The sounds we hear convey meaning.

00:08:21.569 --> 00:08:25.569
With two ears, we can locate a sounds direction.

00:08:25.569 --> 00:08:34.539
Different wave lengths of light are perceived as a range of vivid colors.

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:43.539
Images from each eye combine in three days so that we can better judge depth and distance.

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:52.539
We can detect over 10,000 smells by using a small group of cells that detect microscopic materials in the air.

00:08:52.539 --> 00:09:03.299
We taste, see, smell, touch, and hear in one enjoyable experience.

00:09:03.299 --> 00:09:08.299
All the senses converging in one place are brain.

00:09:08.299 --> 00:09:14.299
Some 200 billion nerve cells connected by trillions of tiny contacts.

00:09:14.299 --> 00:09:18.299
The brain interprets chemical signals from each sense,

00:09:18.299 --> 00:09:24.299
connects new information to what we already know and stores lasting memories.

00:09:24.299 --> 00:09:30.299
Life is a precious gift from our loving creator.

00:09:30.299 --> 00:09:33.299
King David was inspired to write.

00:09:33.299 --> 00:09:39.299
I praise you because in an awe-inspiring way, I am wonderfully made.

00:09:39.299 --> 00:09:42.299
Your works are wonderful.

00:09:42.299 --> 00:09:44.299
I know this very well.
