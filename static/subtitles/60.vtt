00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.780
Welcome, brothers and sisters to JW Broadcasting.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:10.779
In this month's program, we'll learn ways to deal with worry and anxiety.

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:12.779
Here are some highlights.

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:16.780
From childhood, this brother founded a challenge to attend meetings.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:22.780
Go to school, hold a job, and even leave his home each morning.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:29.780
What can we learn from his experience to help us cope with our anxieties one day at a time?

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:36.780
These two sisters have worked shoulder to shoulder in full-time service for more than 60 years.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.780
We'll learn what has helped them to remain joyful despite everyday struggles and unexpected trials.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:50.780
Have you ever wondered what motivates our brothers and sisters to make themselves available for Bethel service?

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:58.780
We'll hear from ones who are serving at Bethel, and we'll learn how to prepare and qualify for this special form of full-time service.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.780
There's much to enjoy in this May 2019 edition of JW Broadcasting.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:31.890
Do you sometimes feel completely overwhelmed when life's problems cause you anxiety?

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.890
Just trying to provide the necessities for one's family can lead to anxiety.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.890
At the same time, you might be dealing with a chronic or life-threatening illness,

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:54.890
caring for a sick or elderly relative, grieving the death of a loved one, loneliness, a natural disaster,

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:01.890
or maybe you're struggling with the devastating effects of past or present abuse.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.889
Now, you firmly believe that God's kingdom will fix these problems, but that's in the future.

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:11.889
What about today?

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:16.889
Perhaps you feel like David, who prayed at Psalm 13 and verse 2,

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:23.889
how long will I have anxious concern with grief in my heart each day?

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:29.889
A sister who has struggled with anxiety for many years wrote this,

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:37.889
anxiety robs me of sleep, impacts my health, affects the way I treat others,

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:41.889
and makes me want to give up. She added,

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:49.889
anxiety is like a monster that lives in my body somewhere between my heart and my belly.

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:53.889
I cannot wait for Jehovah to kill that monster in the new world.

00:02:53.889 --> 00:03:00.889
But until then, the monster snarls and tears at my insides and tries to take over my life.

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:06.139
Can you identify with her feelings?

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:10.139
We often hear a person say concerning anxiety,

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:13.139
I'm just trying to take it one day at a time.

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:16.139
But one brother put it this way.

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:23.139
I try to take it one day at a time, but sometimes several days attack me at once.

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:29.139
For so many of us, anxiety is a daily struggle.

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:34.139
If you battle with anxiety, please know this.

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:39.139
You are not alone. Do not give up the fight.

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:47.139
Jehovah and Jesus are aware of the anxieties that weigh on your mind and that are deep in your heart.

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:54.139
The governing body knows that living in this system of things is especially hard to deal with.

00:03:54.139 --> 00:04:03.379
So the theme chosen for this program is deal with anxiety one day at a time.

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:06.379
First, what is anxiety?

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:12.379
In the Christian Greek scriptures, the word anxious occurs 19 times.

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:16.379
The first occurrence is in Jesus' sermon on the Mount.

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:20.379
Now Jesus knew that people worried about how to provide for their family.

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:27.379
So had Matthew, chapter 6, and verse 25, he gave this wise counsel.

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:36.379
On this account, I say to you, stop being anxious about your life as to what you eat or what you will drink.

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:39.379
Or about your body as to what you will wear.

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:44.379
Does not life mean more than food and the body than clothing?

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:49.949
The study Bible note for verse 25 says,

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:59.949
the degree term for anxious can refer to worry that divides a person's mind and distracts him, robbing him of joy.

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:08.949
At Luke 12, verse 29, Jesus says to stop being an anxious suspense or to stop worrying.

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:17.949
The study note here says that the Greek word for anxious suspense was used to refer to ships being tossed at sea.

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:30.949
It says that Jesus used it figuratively for being anxious or unsettled as if tossed about or wavering because of doubt and anxiety.

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:38.949
By saying, stop being anxious, Jesus recognizes that anxiety is already in progress.

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:42.949
He is very aware of our imperfect nature.

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:56.949
He knows that we tend to bring our worries from yesterday, the would haves, could haves, and should haves, and our imagined worries about tomorrow, the what ifs to today.

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:09.949
But ask yourself, how often have I word myself sick about what might happen tomorrow only to find that tomorrow wasn't nearly as bad as I feared it would be?

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:16.949
Jesus also knows that anxiety can have real, sometimes painful consequences.

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:20.949
It can stop us from making spiritual progress.

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:27.949
Over thinking and over analyzing our problems can literally shut us down.

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:33.949
How though can we stop being anxious? What's the antidote?

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:37.949
Let's consider four practical things we can do.

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:44.949
First, rely on Jehovah and take one day at a time.

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:53.949
This is exactly what Jesus prescribed for us at Matthew chapter 6, verses 33 and 34.

00:06:53.949 --> 00:07:00.949
Keep on then seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you.

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:09.949
So, never be anxious about the next day for the next day will have its own anxieties.

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:13.949
Each day has enough of its own troubles.

00:07:13.949 --> 00:07:29.949
Verse 34 has a study note telling us that undue anxiety about what may happen in the future can adversely affect a person's relationship with God, causing him to rely on his own wisdom rather than on God's.

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:31.949
So what's the lesson?

00:07:31.949 --> 00:07:39.949
Instead of relying on ourselves, rely on Jehovah and take one day at a time.

00:07:39.949 --> 00:07:45.949
A cross reference to Matthew 6, 34 takes us to Exodus 16, verse 4.

00:07:45.949 --> 00:07:54.949
In this account, Jehovah provided the Israelites with enough mana for every day of their 40-year trek.

00:07:54.949 --> 00:07:58.949
Could Jehovah have provided a week's worth of mana?

00:07:58.949 --> 00:08:03.949
A month's worth, a year's worth, of course.

00:08:03.949 --> 00:08:09.949
So why did he only provide enough for each day? Well, think about it.

00:08:09.949 --> 00:08:21.949
When they stepped out of their tents each morning, there was no question whether there would be mana on the ground or not, and there was no question where it came from.

00:08:21.949 --> 00:08:28.949
Jehovah never failed to provide for their needs, not even for one day.

00:08:28.949 --> 00:08:34.950
They also knew from the past that Jehovah always provided for those who were loyal to him.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:38.950
We too can look back at how Jehovah provided for his servants.

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:50.950
We can have complete confidence that Jehovah knows exactly what we need when we need it, for today, tomorrow, and for all eternity.

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:57.950
Even if we have such confidence, why do we sometimes continue to feel anxious?

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:05.950
The simple answer, we're imperfect people trying our best to serve Jehovah in Satan's wicked world.

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:13.950
Daily challenges cause anxiety that can make us forget to rely on Jehovah and take one day at a time.

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:18.950
So we need to add our second way to deal with anxiety.

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:22.950
Pour your heart out to Jehovah in earnest prayer.

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:29.950
Read with me the reassuring words at Philippians 4 verses 6 and 7.

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:41.950
Do not be anxious over anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication, along with Thanksgiving, let your petitions be made known to God.

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:52.950
And the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus.

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:58.950
Paul doesn't simply tell us not to be anxious, but he tells us how.

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:06.950
He said by prayer and supplication, which is earnest and specific prayer.

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:08.950
With what benefit?

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:13.950
The peace of God will guard your hearts.

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:19.950
Guard was a military expression referring to troops assigned to protect a city.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:25.950
The inhabitants could sleep soundly, knowing that soldiers were guarding them at night.

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:33.950
In a similar way, when we have the peace of God, our hearts and minds can rest.

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:38.950
This can prevent us from being overwhelmed by anxiety or discouragement.

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:45.950
How reassuring are the words of the Psalmist at Psalm 4 and verse 8.

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:54.950
I will lie down and sleep in peace. For you alone, O Jehovah, make me dwell in security.

00:10:54.950 --> 00:11:06.950
So when we feel trapped, like there's no way out of our worries, the peace from God gives us hope that there's light at the end of the tunnel.

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:09.950
What though must you do?

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:14.950
Turn your worries into deep, heartfelt prayers.

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:23.950
In fact, at 1 Peter 5 and verse 7, Jehovah invites you to throw all your anxiety on him and leave it with him.

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:26.950
Because he cares for you.

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:31.950
Jehovah is the one person who truly understands how you feel.

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:38.950
He knows every moment of your life, why you feel or react a certain way.

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:48.950
He loves and values you personally, despite your imperfections, your anxieties, your cares and worries.

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:53.950
He not only has the power to help you, he wants to.

00:11:53.950 --> 00:12:06.950
Knowing this should move you to pray specifically, express in your deepest emotions, and plead that he grant you peace of mind and heart.

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:14.950
To the extent you do so, 1 Peter 5, 10 promises that he will make you firm.

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:20.950
He will make you strong. He will firmly ground you.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:24.950
Never underestimate the power of prayer.

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:32.299
Jehovah is always ready to help you one day at a time.

00:12:32.299 --> 00:12:39.299
Our third way to deal with anxiety is to read and meditate on God's Word.

00:12:39.299 --> 00:12:41.299
Let Jehovah speak to you.

00:12:41.299 --> 00:12:46.299
Allow Jehovah's thoughts to become your thoughts.

00:12:46.299 --> 00:12:53.299
At Psalm 94-19, notice how the psalmist admitted his own anxiety.

00:12:54.799 --> 00:13:01.799
When anxieties overwhelmed me, you comforted and soothed me.

00:13:01.799 --> 00:13:11.799
Yes, even servants of God can feel overwhelmed by anxieties, or as one translation says, burden with worries.

00:13:11.799 --> 00:13:17.799
That in itself is comforting, that an inspired Bible writer struggled with anxieties.

00:13:17.799 --> 00:13:25.799
But Jehovah comforted and soothed him, calming his troubled heart.

00:13:25.799 --> 00:13:30.799
God can do the same for us through his inspired word of the Bible.

00:13:30.799 --> 00:13:35.799
Remember, the Bible is how Jehovah speaks to us.

00:13:35.799 --> 00:13:43.799
Rather than allowing our emotions to run wild, we can learn to focus our mind on upbuilding things,

00:13:43.799 --> 00:13:49.799
such as what the Apostle Paul listed at Philippians 4 and verse 8.

00:13:49.799 --> 00:13:56.799
Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are of serious concern,

00:13:56.799 --> 00:14:02.799
whatever things are righteous, whatever things are chased, whatever things are lovable,

00:14:02.799 --> 00:14:07.799
whatever things are well spoken of, whatever things are virtuous,

00:14:07.799 --> 00:14:14.799
and whatever things are praiseworthy, continue considering these things.

00:14:14.799 --> 00:14:22.799
The footnote, to verse 8, shows that considering involves thinking about or meditating on.

00:14:22.799 --> 00:14:27.799
We can and should meditate on positive things from the Bible,

00:14:27.799 --> 00:14:33.799
replacing negative things that may enter our mind and cause anxiety.

00:14:33.799 --> 00:14:40.799
Ask Jehovah to help you to find passages in his word that will sooth your heart.

00:14:40.799 --> 00:14:45.799
Ask others what scriptures have calmed their heart during anxious moments.

00:14:45.799 --> 00:14:53.799
Make your own personal list, then set aside time to read and meditate on those passages.

00:14:53.799 --> 00:14:58.799
Meditation is the doorway to your heart.

00:14:58.799 --> 00:15:04.799
Meditation lets God's thoughts affect you on the deepest possible level.

00:15:04.799 --> 00:15:10.799
Imagine that Jehovah is speaking directly to you because he is.

00:15:10.799 --> 00:15:18.799
Never underestimate the power of God's word, of letting Jehovah speak to you.

00:15:18.799 --> 00:15:24.799
Our fourth way to deal with anxiety is to share your feelings with a trusted friend.

00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:30.080
Proverbs 12.25 says,

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:36.080
anxiety in a man's heart weighs it down, or as a footnote says, depresses him.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:39.080
But a good word cheers it up.

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:47.080
A good word can come from a fellow believer who is motivated by God's spirit and guided by his word.

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:53.080
When the Apostle Paul was alone in prison, he prayed for encouragement,

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:57.080
and Jehovah provided what he needed to cheer him up.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:02.080
With a heart full of appreciation, he said at Colossians 4.11,

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:10.080
that my fellow workers have become a source of great comfort to me, or a strengthening aid.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:16.080
What can you do if you feel weighed down or imprisoned by anxiety?

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.080
Like Paul, pray for encouragement.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:25.080
Pray for someone you can talk to, someone you can trust with your feelings.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:31.080
The answer to your prayer may be an elder or a mature Christian brother or sister.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:37.080
But what if it's difficult for you to open up to others and confide in them?

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:43.080
Try the advice in the March 1st, 1997 Watchtower article,

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.080
Are you afraid to trust others?

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:51.080
When confiding in someone, it says, reveal your concerns gradually.

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:57.080
If he or she responds in an appropriate, sympathetic, and discrete way,

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:01.080
you might then try disclosing more.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:08.079
Even if it takes some effort, never underestimate the power of our brotherhood.

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:14.079
Jehovah can use a fellow worshiper to ease your mind of anxious concern.

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:20.079
Even at times when there's no one to talk to, we can let the experiences,

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:28.079
like building music and talks on JW broadcasting, be like an encouraging hug from a trusted friend.

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:34.079
Yes, when we make the effort, we give Jehovah something to bless.

00:17:34.079 --> 00:17:39.079
Jehovah can help us conquer the seemingly incomparable.

00:17:39.079 --> 00:17:46.079
That may not mean that we'll completely eliminate anxiety, but we can learn to take control.

00:17:46.079 --> 00:17:50.079
How? Remember our four ways.

00:17:50.079 --> 00:17:56.079
First, rely on Jehovah and take one day at a time.

00:17:56.079 --> 00:18:02.079
Second, pour out your heart to Jehovah in earnest, specific prayer.

00:18:02.079 --> 00:18:06.079
Third, read and meditate on God's word.

00:18:06.079 --> 00:18:09.079
Let Jehovah speak to you.

00:18:09.079 --> 00:18:13.079
And fourth, share your feelings with a trusted friend.

00:18:13.079 --> 00:18:20.079
With Jehovah's help, you can deal with anxiety one day at a time.

00:18:20.079 --> 00:18:27.079
Earlier, I read a quote from the sister who described anxiety as a monster living inside her.

00:18:27.079 --> 00:18:37.079
I'm so pleased to say that the sister who wrote that letter about her anxieties is actually here with us in the studio to tell us more about her experience.

00:18:37.079 --> 00:18:40.079
This is Jordan Williams and her husband Robert.

00:18:40.079 --> 00:18:45.079
Thank you so much for coming here to share with us your battle with anxiety.

00:18:45.079 --> 00:18:47.079
Can you elaborate on that please?

00:18:47.079 --> 00:18:51.079
I feel ashamed of my anxiety.

00:18:51.079 --> 00:18:55.079
I feel like there's something wrong with me and I feel guilty about that.

00:18:55.079 --> 00:19:05.079
I feel like I'm letting Jehovah down by feeling anxious and that I'm even being disobedient to Jesus when he says stop being anxious, but I just can't.

00:19:05.079 --> 00:19:07.079
Thank you for sharing that.

00:19:07.079 --> 00:19:12.079
Robert, what do you do to help Jordan battle this anxiety?

00:19:12.079 --> 00:19:17.079
It's a monster that sometimes a very stubborn monster that won't go away.

00:19:17.079 --> 00:19:30.079
Remembering that, remembering that it's not her fault that helps me be more compassionate, caring, listening when she's explaining these anxieties that I may not completely understand.

00:19:30.079 --> 00:19:34.079
Jordan, are there other practical things that help you battle anxiety?

00:19:34.079 --> 00:19:38.079
The single biggest help is walking with Jehovah every day.

00:19:38.079 --> 00:19:40.079
I mean that literally.

00:19:40.079 --> 00:19:50.079
I'll wake up in the morning, super anxious and I can't breathe and my chest is tight and I'll get up and I'll read the chapter of the Bible that the daily text comes from.

00:19:50.079 --> 00:19:57.079
And then I'll go on a walk and talk to Jehovah for an hour and I try to use the model prayer as an outline.

00:19:57.079 --> 00:20:04.079
So I'll talk to Jehovah about his name and how I feel so privileged to have that name on me.

00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:11.079
And I'll talk to him about his kingdom that's going to solve all of these problems, including anxiety.

00:20:11.079 --> 00:20:18.079
And I'll talk to him about his will and specifically what his will is for me that day.

00:20:18.079 --> 00:20:23.079
And most of the time, those three things cover the things that were worrying me.

00:20:23.079 --> 00:20:27.079
But if there is another thing, I'll talk to him specifically about that.

00:20:27.079 --> 00:20:29.079
What a nice walk you have with Jehovah.

00:20:29.079 --> 00:20:33.079
Are there other things that help you deal and battle anxiety?

00:20:33.079 --> 00:20:37.079
Personal study projects help a lot, especially if they don't have anything to do with anxiety.

00:20:37.079 --> 00:20:45.079
If I do a study project on the spiritual suit of armor or the ransom, it kind of distracts the anxiety monster.

00:20:45.079 --> 00:20:47.079
So my heart can calm down.

00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:52.079
And then these pearls of wisdom will come from Jehovah and they can get in.

00:20:52.079 --> 00:20:56.079
And if some of those pearls are actually just what I need to deal with my anxiety.

00:20:56.079 --> 00:20:59.079
Are there specific things that help you?

00:20:59.079 --> 00:21:05.079
Yes. I made an anxiety tab in the personal study section of my study Bible on my tablet.

00:21:05.079 --> 00:21:10.079
And I collect scriptures and comments that really help with my anxiety.

00:21:10.079 --> 00:21:20.079
For example, in 2014, there was a regional convention talk about Matthew chapter six and six specific things that combat anxiety.

00:21:20.079 --> 00:21:25.079
And it made me think of like the 12-step program to overcoming addiction.

00:21:25.079 --> 00:21:27.079
This is the six steps to overcoming anxiety.

00:21:27.079 --> 00:21:29.079
What are those six steps?

00:21:29.079 --> 00:21:39.079
The first one is to help those in need and then pray a lot to be forgiving, not to be hypocritical, to store up treasures in heaven,

00:21:39.079 --> 00:21:42.079
and then to focus on spiritual matters.

00:21:42.079 --> 00:21:46.079
So when we got back from the convention, she took those items.

00:21:46.079 --> 00:21:49.079
She wrote them down and put them on magnets and put them on our refrigerator.

00:21:49.079 --> 00:21:52.079
I try to do each one of those six things every day.

00:21:52.079 --> 00:21:57.079
And when I accomplish one, I'll turn the magnet so I can see what I still need to work on.

00:21:57.079 --> 00:22:02.079
So when I come into the refrigerator in the morning, if the magnets are turned, we know where she's at.

00:22:02.079 --> 00:22:04.079
If they're not turned, we know we're in trouble.

00:22:04.079 --> 00:22:05.079
It's a bad day.

00:22:05.079 --> 00:22:06.079
Time to do something else.

00:22:07.079 --> 00:22:12.079
So what can others do or say that would be helpful to those going through anxiety?

00:22:12.079 --> 00:22:21.079
For the friends, it's really nice when they're understanding and non-judgmental and respect my privacy.

00:22:21.079 --> 00:22:22.079
That's really helpful.

00:22:22.079 --> 00:22:29.079
And when they don't freeze me in time, decide that, oh, she's anxious and this is how she's going to be all the time.

00:22:29.079 --> 00:22:31.079
That's really helpful.

00:22:31.079 --> 00:22:34.079
I even forget that Jehovah approves of me.

00:22:34.079 --> 00:22:41.079
So reminding me of that, reminding me that the things that I do to please him are successful.

00:22:41.079 --> 00:22:46.079
And maybe even reminding me of things that I've accomplished for Jehovah in the past.

00:22:46.079 --> 00:22:49.079
You know you should tell Ron about your broken dish.

00:22:49.079 --> 00:22:50.079
Oh, yeah.

00:22:50.079 --> 00:22:52.079
Yes, I'd like to know about that.

00:22:52.079 --> 00:22:57.079
So I just found out about this Japanese art called Kinsukuroi.

00:22:57.079 --> 00:23:02.079
And it's basically taking a broken piece of pottery and fixing it

00:23:02.079 --> 00:23:05.079
by putting it back together with gold or silver lacquer.

00:23:05.079 --> 00:23:11.079
And the concept is that the piece is more beautiful for having been broken.

00:23:11.079 --> 00:23:16.079
And that really resonates with me because I do feel broken by anxiety.

00:23:16.079 --> 00:23:19.079
But Jehovah gave Jesus as the ransom.

00:23:19.079 --> 00:23:21.079
And that ransom is just pure gold.

00:23:21.079 --> 00:23:27.079
And he can take all the broken anxious little bits of me and put me back together.

00:23:28.079 --> 00:23:33.079
And maybe I'll even be more useful to Jehovah for having been broken.

00:23:33.079 --> 00:23:34.079
That's very precious.

00:23:34.079 --> 00:23:36.079
Thank you for sharing that.

00:23:36.079 --> 00:23:39.079
Are there other things that help you deal with anxiety?

00:23:39.079 --> 00:23:42.079
I've learned to recognize when anxiety is clouding my thinking.

00:23:42.079 --> 00:23:46.079
And I'll ask him, can I borrow your brain for a minute, please?

00:23:46.079 --> 00:23:50.079
So what we did is we went and purchased a whiteboard, put it in my office.

00:23:50.079 --> 00:23:55.079
And sometimes we'll go to the whiteboard and write out all the anxieties that she's dealing with.

00:23:55.079 --> 00:23:59.079
As we're writing them out, sometimes we realize those are yesterday's anxieties.

00:23:59.079 --> 00:24:01.079
And they've been cared for.

00:24:01.079 --> 00:24:03.079
So we can erase those from the board.

00:24:03.079 --> 00:24:05.079
Some of them are from tomorrow.

00:24:05.079 --> 00:24:08.079
And so we don't want to borrow those and bring them today.

00:24:08.079 --> 00:24:09.079
That's tomorrow's anxiety.

00:24:09.079 --> 00:24:12.079
And some anxieties can be grouped in little clusters.

00:24:12.079 --> 00:24:15.079
And you can realize the root is here.

00:24:15.079 --> 00:24:17.079
Let's focus on that.

00:24:17.079 --> 00:24:20.079
I fight anxiety every single day.

00:24:20.079 --> 00:24:23.079
And anxiety is constantly changing its tactics.

00:24:23.079 --> 00:24:25.079
So I have to be adaptable.

00:24:25.079 --> 00:24:30.079
But Jehovah never leaves me to fight anxiety alone ever.

00:24:30.079 --> 00:24:35.079
I don't understand what I've done to merit all of his attention.

00:24:35.079 --> 00:24:40.079
But I do realize that I don't need to understand why he loves me.

00:24:40.079 --> 00:24:42.079
I trust him and he never lies.

00:24:42.079 --> 00:24:46.079
So I just need to accept it when he shows me that.

00:24:46.079 --> 00:24:48.079
We appreciate you sharing those personal feelings.

00:24:48.079 --> 00:24:52.079
And again, we know that Jehovah and Jesus are so proud of you.

00:24:52.079 --> 00:24:55.079
And we know that those who are listening into this interview

00:24:55.079 --> 00:24:59.079
will benefit so much from listening to your personal expressions.

00:24:59.079 --> 00:25:01.079
Thank you very much.

00:25:01.079 --> 00:25:05.079
Anxieties can surface at any time in our lives.

00:25:05.079 --> 00:25:07.079
Even when we're very young.

00:25:07.079 --> 00:25:11.079
Imagine, though, if the stress of growing up in this system

00:25:11.079 --> 00:25:14.079
was made worse by a chronic disorder.

00:25:14.079 --> 00:25:18.079
One that made anxiety feel impossible to overcome.

00:25:19.079 --> 00:25:21.079
We'll be encouraged by the experience

00:25:21.079 --> 00:25:25.079
of Brother Steve Dott, who never gave up on Jehovah.

00:25:25.079 --> 00:25:30.079
See if you can identify what has helped him cope one day at a time.

00:25:30.079 --> 00:25:33.900
My name is Steve Dott.

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:38.900
I was born in 1988 in Darwin, non-territory.

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:44.900
When I was eight years old, I realized that life was getting very difficult for me.

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.900
I was diagnosed with ADHD.

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:51.900
I obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome.

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:55.900
And on top of all of that, I was diagnosed with severe anxiety as well.

00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:58.900
My mum said this affected the entire family,

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:04.900
because I would repeatedly yell out goodnight to each individual person in the family.

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:09.900
And on top of that, I used to constantly go around the house,

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:12.900
checking the locks and the windows.

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:18.900
My school life was the hardest thing I'd ever had to deal with.

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:22.900
My school was approximately 500 metres from my home.

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:25.900
It would take me at least two hours to get to school,

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:30.900
because one of my obsessions was there was cracks on the footpath.

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:36.900
And if I stepped on one, I'd have to go all the way back home and start again.

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:40.900
I found life to be a constant struggle.

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:43.900
And as I got older, it only got worse.

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:48.900
Even at 10 years old, I decided that I wanted to end my life.

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:52.900
So it would make everyone in the family's life a lot easier.

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:58.900
But then we decided to use some medication, which eased my problems a little bit.

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:04.900
Despite having medication, life was still completely unbearable for me.

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:08.900
I had a constant struggle every day within myself.

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:11.900
I used to wash my hands hundreds of times a day.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:13.900
I couldn't leave the home.

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:15.900
I couldn't get a driver's license.

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.900
I couldn't even get a job.

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:22.900
A major turning point in my life was my mum's unwavering faith in Jehovah.

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:26.900
She used to iron my clothes for the meeting and hang him on the door knob,

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:29.900
even though that wasn't ready to attend the meeting.

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:33.900
But what she didn't know was when my mum went to the meeting with my sister,

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:37.900
I'd get a Bible and I'd try and start to read it.

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:40.900
I also began to pray to Jehovah.

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:44.900
And then one day I thought, I'm going to give this a shot.

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:48.900
So I put my suit on, I got ready, and I went to the meeting.

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:52.900
When I went to the Kingdom Hall, I was absolutely terrified.

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.900
I was so nervous.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:58.900
But when I got there, I saw an elder who used to come and visit me.

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:01.900
And he made me feel very relaxed.

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:05.900
And then the amazing welcome by the brothers and sisters.

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:09.900
It made me feel like I was part of Jehovah's organization again.

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:14.900
The scripture that really helped me was 1 Peter 5 verse 7,

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:18.900
because it says, while you throw all your anxiety on him,

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:20.900
because he cares for you.

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:24.900
So this made me feel like I had a very powerful friend

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:29.900
and Jehovah wanted me to throw my anxieties on him because he loved me.

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:32.900
On September the 4th, 2010,

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:35.900
it was my most important day of my life.

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:38.900
I got baptized as one of Jehovah's Witnesses

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:40.900
at Adelaide Entertainment Centre.

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:43.900
Well, now I serve as a ministerial servant.

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:46.900
I've had the privilege of giving public talks,

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:50.900
which is something I never thought I'd ever be able to do.

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:53.900
I completed Pioneer School after three attempts,

00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:58.900
because the Pioneer School environment made me feel like I was back at school,

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:01.900
and made me have anxiety again.

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:03.900
So the third time I completed it,

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:09.900
and none of this would ever have been possible without Jehovah's help.

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:14.900
On the 6th of August 2016, I married my beautiful wife, Laura,

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:16.900
who helped me serve Jehovah,

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:19.900
and we can serve Jehovah every day together.

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:21.900
I, like the Apostle Paul,

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:24.900
still feel like I have a war inside me sometimes.

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:28.900
But definitely, Jehovah has never let me down.

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:31.900
Never give up on serving Jehovah,

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:34.900
because Jehovah will never give up on you.

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:39.900
Did you notice what Stang considered the turning point in his life?

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:43.900
It was the unwavering faith of his mum,

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:45.900
the warmth of the congregation,

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:49.900
and most of all, help from Jehovah.

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:52.900
He called Jehovah a very powerful friend.

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:55.900
That's so true.

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:59.900
Brother Dott overcame monumental challenges.

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:02.900
But is his struggle with anxiety over?

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:06.900
No. He said that like the Apostle Paul,

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:10.900
he sometimes still feels a war within himself.

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:13.900
Do you ever feel that way?

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:20.900
This month's music video reminds us that we can find peace and joy despite our burdens.

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:25.900
It's entitled each day has its own anxieties.

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:38.789
I know about the paradise under God's kingdom.

00:30:38.789 --> 00:30:41.789
And I believe with all my heart,

00:30:41.789 --> 00:30:44.789
the better days will come.

00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:49.490
But sometimes in this life for me,

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:53.490
it's hard to see the things unseen.

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:56.490
I feel the love I know is there.

00:30:56.490 --> 00:31:01.829
When my heart is in despair,

00:31:01.829 --> 00:31:11.180
but I know Jehovah's need.

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:20.059
So I say pray from the hover,

00:31:20.059 --> 00:31:26.589
take my mind on a strength that can relax.

00:31:26.589 --> 00:31:39.519
I'm not a true friend who really cares,

00:31:39.519 --> 00:31:50.420
has its own take one.

00:31:50.420 --> 00:32:28.720
But tomorrow I've said my Freddie gave his son.

00:32:28.720 --> 00:34:59.280
So never now keep trusting.

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:02.280
We're not alone for he is there.

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:08.280
We have his words of comfort and true friends who really care.

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:11.280
What an encouraging thought from that song.

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:17.280
Yes, true friends who share our love for Jehovah are invaluable.

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:20.280
We'll see that in this story from Japan.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:24.280
Sisters Takaku Sato and he saw Kuwaku-i

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:28.280
have worked together as pioneers since 1957.

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:35.280
Let's learn how their friendship has helped them serve Jehovah with joy.

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:38.280
We are pioneer partners.

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:42.280
We've been working together for over 60 years.

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:50.659
In 1956, I was the only Jehovah's Witness in Nagano Prefecture.

00:35:50.659 --> 00:35:55.659
It was long soon, but I applied for regular pioneer service.

00:35:55.659 --> 00:36:00.659
Surprisingly, I was appointed as a special pioneer.

00:36:00.659 --> 00:36:07.659
I was so happy that I found myself rolling around on the tatami mat floor

00:36:07.659 --> 00:36:10.659
with the appointment letter in my hand.

00:36:10.659 --> 00:36:14.659
That was the way I expressed my joy and appreciation.

00:36:14.659 --> 00:36:19.659
When I was invited to serve as a special pioneer, I was sent to Nagano.

00:36:19.659 --> 00:36:23.659
And that's where I met Hisako.

00:36:23.659 --> 00:36:26.659
Takaku and I focused on our ministry.

00:36:26.659 --> 00:36:33.420
When an isolated group was established, since there were no brothers,

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:37.420
I would wear a head covering and conduct a meeting.

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:41.420
Sometimes the outlines were in English.

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:44.420
We didn't understand anything.

00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:48.420
But people were delighted to hear even just the scriptures

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:51.420
and went home satisfied.

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:59.329
And that strongly impressed me the power of God's Word.

00:36:59.329 --> 00:37:03.329
We were assigned to a territory in the city after that.

00:37:03.329 --> 00:37:07.329
We found so many not at homes.

00:37:07.329 --> 00:37:11.329
But we determined to meet people.

00:37:11.329 --> 00:37:15.329
So we changed the times we preached and talked to people on the street

00:37:15.329 --> 00:37:17.329
who were going to work.

00:37:17.329 --> 00:37:20.329
We cherished even small opportunities.

00:37:20.329 --> 00:37:23.329
When we had a chance to meet a householder,

00:37:23.329 --> 00:37:29.329
we always tried to have a conversation that we could link to the next visit.

00:37:29.329 --> 00:37:33.329
Before long, I had 10 Bible studies.

00:37:33.329 --> 00:37:37.639
Takaku acts like she is cheerful,

00:37:37.639 --> 00:37:42.639
but she's been fighting with various illnesses.

00:37:42.639 --> 00:37:49.639
At times, it was so bad that I could not even go out in service.

00:37:50.639 --> 00:37:54.639
I had a serious skin condition.

00:37:54.639 --> 00:37:59.639
I could not bear to look at the illustration of Job in the magazine

00:37:59.639 --> 00:38:02.639
and I covered it up with paper.

00:38:02.639 --> 00:38:09.300
But Jehovah helped me to look to Job's example.

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:17.179
I learned that our endurance under trial would become praise to God.

00:38:17.179 --> 00:38:21.780
I have often had health problems.

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:30.260
Just at one of those times, I received a letter from the branch.

00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:31.260
It said,

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:36.260
what you're going to accomplish now may be limited.

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:43.260
However, think about all that you have done up to now to give praise to Jehovah.

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:47.260
About the people you were able to help learn the truth

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:52.260
and be joyful knowing that you have been used by Jehovah fully.

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:59.980
I couldn't stop crying because I really felt the care and concern

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:02.980
from the organization and from Jehovah.

00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:10.340
Hisako also took real good care of me and prayed with me.

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:17.159
Our thinking and personality are different,

00:39:17.159 --> 00:39:21.159
but we made efforts to talk things out.

00:39:21.159 --> 00:39:25.159
Our heartfelt desire to want to serve Jehovah full-time

00:39:25.159 --> 00:39:30.460
has always been the same.

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:37.460
For 60 years, we've enjoyed a truly wonderful life of service to Jehovah.

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:41.460
Jehovah has supported us in difficult times through the Bible,

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:44.460
the organization and friends.

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:47.460
I have tasted the truthfulness of the words,

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:51.460
when I am weak, then I am powerful.

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:58.119
When I said, my foot is slipping,

00:39:58.119 --> 00:40:02.119
your kindness so Jehovah has supported me.

00:40:02.119 --> 00:40:06.119
I can say that too.

00:40:06.119 --> 00:40:09.119
Although we don't have energy nor ability,

00:40:09.119 --> 00:40:15.429
we've been able to enjoy full-time service together up to now.

00:40:15.429 --> 00:40:17.429
I'm really content now.

00:40:17.429 --> 00:40:23.219
It's all thanks to Jehovah.

00:40:23.219 --> 00:40:27.219
Like the Apostle Paul, our sisters cultivated singleness

00:40:27.219 --> 00:40:33.219
and focused on full-time service to Jehovah for more than 60 years.

00:40:33.219 --> 00:40:36.219
Yes, they face everyday challenges

00:40:36.219 --> 00:40:39.219
and the extra ones that come with age,

00:40:39.219 --> 00:40:43.219
but their heartfelt desire to serve Jehovah whole soul

00:40:43.219 --> 00:40:49.219
brings Takaku and Hisaku real joy and contentment.

00:40:49.219 --> 00:40:53.219
Whole-sold service for nearly 20,000 brothers and sisters

00:40:53.219 --> 00:40:57.219
is a full-time assignment at Bethel.

00:40:57.219 --> 00:41:01.219
What motivates them to reach out for this special privilege?

00:41:01.219 --> 00:41:04.219
What blessings do they experience?

00:41:04.219 --> 00:41:09.219
And what's the best way to prepare and qualify for Bethel service?

00:41:09.219 --> 00:41:12.219
I'd like to invite my friend Patrick LaFranca

00:41:12.219 --> 00:41:14.219
to discuss these and other questions.

00:41:14.219 --> 00:41:16.219
Welcome, Pat.

00:41:16.219 --> 00:41:18.219
Thank you, Ron.

00:41:18.219 --> 00:41:22.219
How heartwarming it's been to see millions take their stand

00:41:22.219 --> 00:41:24.219
for true worship.

00:41:24.219 --> 00:41:27.219
Thousands more are joining us every week.

00:41:27.219 --> 00:41:30.219
Jehovah is speeding up the in-gathering work,

00:41:30.219 --> 00:41:33.219
and this makes us very happy.

00:41:33.219 --> 00:41:36.219
But who will work to provide the Bible,

00:41:36.219 --> 00:41:40.219
Bible literature and the audio and video publications

00:41:40.219 --> 00:41:44.219
that sustain us spiritually and help us to accomplish our

00:41:44.219 --> 00:41:47.219
kingdom preaching and teaching work?

00:41:47.219 --> 00:41:50.219
Bethel is a unique place.

00:41:50.219 --> 00:41:55.219
It's where mature Christians render sacred service to Jehovah

00:41:55.219 --> 00:41:58.219
in close association with Christ's brothers.

00:41:58.219 --> 00:42:02.219
They minister to the needs of our worldwide brotherhood

00:42:02.219 --> 00:42:05.219
and support the preaching work.

00:42:05.219 --> 00:42:09.219
The Bethel family is a group of dedicated,

00:42:09.219 --> 00:42:14.219
baptized servants of Jehovah who live and work together closely.

00:42:14.219 --> 00:42:21.219
So they experience in a special way what Psalm 133 1 says.

00:42:21.219 --> 00:42:26.219
Look how good and how pleasant it is for brothers

00:42:26.219 --> 00:42:29.219
to dwell together in unity.

00:42:29.219 --> 00:42:33.219
We're very pleased to see that many have expanded their service

00:42:33.219 --> 00:42:37.219
to Jehovah by making themselves available for the special

00:42:37.219 --> 00:42:40.219
privilege of Bethel service.

00:42:40.219 --> 00:42:43.219
Have you considered this as a goal?

00:42:43.219 --> 00:42:48.559
Making yourself available for Bethel service is like knocking

00:42:48.559 --> 00:42:52.559
on a door that leads to many other privileges of service.

00:42:52.559 --> 00:42:57.559
Of course, to serve at Bethel requires a self-sacrificing spirit

00:42:57.559 --> 00:43:01.559
and a willingness to serve wherever there is a need in harmony

00:43:01.559 --> 00:43:06.559
with the attitude displayed by the prophet Isaiah in Isaiah 6.8.

00:43:06.559 --> 00:43:09.559
Then I heard the voice of Jehovah saying,

00:43:09.559 --> 00:43:13.559
whom shall I send and who will go for us?

00:43:13.559 --> 00:43:17.559
And I said, here I am, send me.

00:43:18.559 --> 00:43:23.559
When Isaiah learned about an opportunity to do more in Jehovah service,

00:43:23.559 --> 00:43:27.559
he responded eagerly, even though he did not know exactly

00:43:27.559 --> 00:43:29.559
what he was going to be assigned to do.

00:43:29.559 --> 00:43:33.559
It was enough for him to know that Jehovah was extending an invitation

00:43:33.559 --> 00:43:38.559
to serve in a special way and Isaiah wanted to volunteer.

00:43:38.559 --> 00:43:44.559
The same spirit is shown by Bethel family members worldwide.

00:43:45.559 --> 00:43:49.559
What especially motivates so many to serve at Bethel?

00:43:49.559 --> 00:43:53.559
Love for Jehovah moves us to put kingdom interest ahead of

00:43:53.559 --> 00:43:58.559
self-interest, as stated in the Proclaimers book, page 295.

00:43:58.559 --> 00:44:02.559
This is not work in which they gain personal prominence or

00:44:02.559 --> 00:44:03.559
material possessions.

00:44:03.559 --> 00:44:07.559
Their desire is to honor Jehovah and they are satisfied

00:44:07.559 --> 00:44:11.559
with the provisions made for them in the way of food, lodging,

00:44:11.559 --> 00:44:15.559
and a modest allowance for personal expenses.

00:44:15.559 --> 00:44:20.559
Are there any rewards that come from serving in this unique way?

00:44:20.559 --> 00:44:23.559
Those who have offered themselves willingly for Bethel service

00:44:23.559 --> 00:44:26.559
have truly been blessed.

00:44:26.559 --> 00:44:31.559
The love and unity we feel here is incomparable.

00:44:31.559 --> 00:44:33.559
It's not like in a company out in the world,

00:44:33.559 --> 00:44:37.559
because here you can work with your friends every day.

00:44:40.059 --> 00:44:43.059
Like-minded people have the same goals and support each other.

00:44:43.059 --> 00:44:45.059
That is what you can feel here.

00:44:45.059 --> 00:44:49.059
Maybe you are assigned a task that you've never performed before,

00:44:49.059 --> 00:44:52.059
but there are many experienced brothers and sisters

00:44:52.059 --> 00:44:56.059
who can help professionally as well as personally.

00:44:56.059 --> 00:45:00.059
Whether it's the consideration of the daily text or watch

00:45:00.059 --> 00:45:02.059
test study with the Bethel family,

00:45:02.059 --> 00:45:05.059
listening to the practical, valuable comments of our brothers

00:45:05.059 --> 00:45:07.059
and sisters is really refreshing.

00:45:08.059 --> 00:45:10.059
You really feel that they love Jehovah

00:45:10.059 --> 00:45:12.059
and their comments help you to feel the same.

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:17.440
Here in Bethel you have the best employer that there is.

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:22.440
Jehovah, no other employer is as grateful and considerate as he is.

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:26.440
So out of love for Jehovah, you're simply happy to give him your best.

00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:30.440
Whenever I think about what has been done at Bethel,

00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:32.440
publications are being produced and shipped.

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:35.440
Videos for our conventions are being made

00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:39.440
and there is translation being done into so many different languages.

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:41.440
I keep getting goosebumps.

00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:45.440
No matter what I can do here, knowing that by doing it

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:49.440
I'm supporting Christ's brothers makes me feel very, very good.

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:55.440
So how does a young person qualify for Bethel's service?

00:45:55.440 --> 00:46:00.440
My parents raised me to have a spiritual focus.

00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:03.440
So in the school holidays or as growing up,

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:08.440
our life revolved around the ministry doing spiritual activities

00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:12.440
and it really helped us keep focused spiritually as a family

00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:17.440
and helped me stay focused on the goals that we wanted to achieve.

00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:22.440
I really enjoy reading and one day my dad just said to me,

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:24.440
why don't you read the Bible?

00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:27.440
I know it sounds obvious but at that point I'd never read it

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:29.440
from Genesis to Revelation.

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:32.440
So when I've finished reading the Bible,

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:36.440
it really changed my thinking and my,

00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:39.440
it really proved the truth to myself.

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:44.440
And this helped me to keep a spiritual focus

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:48.440
and it really was the first step in reaching out

00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:52.440
and achieving the spiritual goals that I wanted to achieve.

00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:55.440
In the congregation I was able to help out with doing the magazines

00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:57.440
and the sound and the platform

00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:00.440
and doing these privileges.

00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:03.440
It really helped me to build a good work ethic

00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:07.440
and given ways that I could give more to Jehovah.

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:10.440
So the elders used to work with me a lot on the ministry.

00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:14.440
So when I'd get to feeling like, I can't do this

00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:16.440
or this is too much, it's too overwhelming

00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:19.440
or I'd never be able to reach this goal.

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:21.440
And elders showed me a scripture,

00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:26.440
the Bible where Jehovah was encouraging Joshua to be courageous.

00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:32.440
And that really impacted me that I was able to be courageous too

00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:35.440
to reach my goal of Bethel.

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:38.440
So when I visited Bethel,

00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:41.440
I saw that there were normal people

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:47.440
and they had so many good qualities that I wanted to imitate.

00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:51.440
Very hospitable, very warm, very inviting.

00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:56.440
That helped me to want to reach my goal so I could be like that.

00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:02.440
To serve at Bethel, there are qualifications that need to be met.

00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:06.440
You should have a deep love for Jehovah in the organization

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:10.440
which is demonstrated by living in harmony with Bible standards.

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:15.440
You must have a fine reputation as a spiritual person.

00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:18.440
You should have respect for Jehovah's moral standards

00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:22.440
of audience uncleanness and sexual immorality.

00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:25.440
You should have a clean conscience before Jehovah

00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:30.440
and be at peace with yourself and with Jehovah's organization.

00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:33.440
Your dress and grooming should be exemplary.

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:37.440
Be fitting a Christian minister even during leisure time.

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:40.440
Styles that are fatish or extreme

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:44.440
or that identify us with undesirable elements of the world

00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:47.440
are not acceptable at Bethel.

00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:52.440
The applicant would not read, listen to or view any type of material

00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:55.440
that is inappropriate for a Christian.

00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:59.440
Such unhost some material certainly would include pornography,

00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:05.440
debasing music, or any kind of entertainment that features sexual immorality,

00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:08.440
spiritism, or violence.

00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:13.440
Bethel applicants should be from 19 to 35 years of age.

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:18.440
Occasionally, there is an opening for someone over 35 years of age

00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:22.440
who may have specialized skills that are needed at Bethel,

00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:26.440
such as those with certain technical or medical experience,

00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:31.440
translation skills, or building trades such as plumbing, electrical,

00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:35.440
heavy equipment mechanic, or carpentry.

00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:40.440
Those with such capabilities and training are welcome to apply.

00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:44.440
In view of the unique demands of a full-time assignment at Bethel,

00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:49.440
you should be mentally and emotionally sound, physically strong,

00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:52.440
and able to work long hours.

00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:58.440
You should be able to read, write, and speak the primary language of the branch territory.

00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:02.440
This will enable you to communicate well with others serving at Bethel

00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:08.440
to receive needed training and to work safely in the Bethel environment.

00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:12.440
Bethel applicants agreed to serve for a minimum of one year,

00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:18.440
during which time you will receive training for continued Bethel service.

00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:21.440
With regard to secular skills,

00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:26.440
we do not encourage individuals to obtain university education or training

00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:30.440
with a thought that this will improve their chances of being called into Bethel.

00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:37.440
The best way to prepare for Bethel service is to first serve in the full-time pioneer ministry.

00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:41.440
The greatest need is for single brothers.

00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:45.440
However, all who meet the qualifications, including sisters,

00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:49.440
are encouraged to apply for temporary volunteer service.

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:53.440
Serving as a temporary volunteer at Bethel may open the way to other opportunities

00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:56.440
to expand your service to Jehovah.

00:50:56.440 --> 00:51:00.440
If you are interested in applying for Bethel service,

00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:05.440
which application should you request from a member of your congregation service committee?

00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:09.440
Since there are two types of applications available,

00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:14.440
first, give careful and prayerful consideration to your circumstances.

00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:20.440
Thereafter, decide whether you will request from the elders the application for volunteer program,

00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:25.440
A19, which is available for those interested in serving on a temporary basis

00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:30.440
for as brief as one week or as long as several consecutive months.

00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:35.440
Or you may decide to request the application to become a member of the worldwide order

00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:40.440
of special full-time servants of Jehovah's Witnesses A8.

00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:47.440
This application is for those interested in serving on a long-term basis for one full year or longer.

00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:51.440
If the branch committee determines that there is a need for your services,

00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:59.440
they will decide where you can best be used, whether it Bethel or perhaps on the Theocratic Construction Assignment.

00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:04.440
Submitting your application may open a door of opportunity to serve Jehovah

00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:08.440
and his organization in a variety of ways.

00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:16.010
Of course, not all of us who have such a self-sacrificing spirit

00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:20.010
have the circumstances in life to serve at Bethel,

00:52:20.010 --> 00:52:23.010
but we can encourage others who do.

00:52:23.010 --> 00:52:28.010
Parents follow the example of God-fearing parents,

00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:31.010
such as Hannah and Alcano,

00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:37.010
who willingly made their son available for expanded Theocratic privileges.

00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:41.010
Continue to place the goal of Bethel's service before your young ones

00:52:41.010 --> 00:52:46.010
and stimulate their interest in the full-time ministry by your example

00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:49.010
and your positive expressions.

00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:55.010
If possible, bring them on a tour of World Headquarters in New York, USA,

00:52:55.010 --> 00:53:01.010
or make arrangements to bring them on a tour of the Bethel in the branch territory

00:53:01.010 --> 00:53:04.010
in which you live.

00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:09.010
Such visits can help young ones to witness firsthand the work that's being done at Bethel

00:53:09.010 --> 00:53:12.010
to promote Kingdom interest.

00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:16.010
Elders, help young ones in your congregations

00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:22.010
who have the potential to expand their service to Jehovah to meet the qualifications.

00:53:23.010 --> 00:53:28.010
Jehovah continues to look for those willing to respond to his invitation

00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:31.010
to expand their service to him.

00:53:31.010 --> 00:53:34.010
As in Isaiah's day, he asks,

00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:38.010
whom shall I send and who will go for us?

00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:41.010
Will you answer as did the prophet?

00:53:41.010 --> 00:53:44.010
Here I am, send me.

00:53:44.010 --> 00:53:47.010
We encourage you to progress to spiritual maturity

00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:50.010
and serve Jehovah whole soul.

00:53:50.010 --> 00:53:53.010
In due time, you may qualify to serve at Bethel

00:53:53.010 --> 00:53:57.010
or in another form of exciting Theocratic service

00:53:57.010 --> 00:54:02.010
that permits you to use the health and strength that Jehovah's granted you

00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:07.010
in an expanded way all to his praise.

00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:12.010
Please be assured that we love you for the willing spirit you show

00:54:12.010 --> 00:54:17.010
as you continue to reach out in Jehovah's service.

00:54:17.010 --> 00:54:19.010
Thank you, Pat.

00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:23.010
We hope that the information Brother LaFranca shared

00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:29.010
motivates many more to have the prophet Isaiah's willing and self-sacrificing spirit.

00:54:29.010 --> 00:54:36.010
So much of what Jehovah provides encourages us to keep busy with spiritual things.

00:54:36.010 --> 00:54:40.010
For one, we're looking forward to our upcoming conventions.

00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:44.010
The theme for this year is love never fails.

00:54:44.010 --> 00:54:47.010
Would you like a preview of the program?

00:54:47.010 --> 00:54:50.010
Let's take a look.

00:54:50.010 --> 00:54:52.010
Love.

00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:53.010
Is it gone?

00:54:53.010 --> 00:54:58.820
Have we lost it?

00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:01.820
Is it the possession of the wealthy?

00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:06.139
The strong?

00:55:06.139 --> 00:55:10.139
Or is it somewhere else?

00:55:10.139 --> 00:55:13.139
At the 2019 Convention of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:55:13.139 --> 00:55:17.139
you will learn what real love is.

00:55:17.139 --> 00:55:23.139
Where to find it, how to show it, and have it shown in return.

00:55:23.139 --> 00:55:29.559
God cares deeply about you.

00:55:29.559 --> 00:55:33.559
And he wants you to know that in this hate-filled world,

00:55:33.559 --> 00:55:36.559
love can be found.

00:55:36.559 --> 00:55:49.250
It is not lost, and that love will never fail.

00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:54.250
As we've discussed, we should never underestimate the power of our brotherhood

00:55:54.250 --> 00:55:58.250
to help us overcome worries and anxiety.

00:55:58.250 --> 00:56:02.250
Our conventions are wonderful opportunities for us to encourage one another

00:56:02.250 --> 00:56:07.250
by the hundreds, thousands, and tens of thousands.

00:56:07.250 --> 00:56:12.250
And this year, we're especially excited that 24 international conventions

00:56:12.250 --> 00:56:15.250
will be held throughout the world.

00:56:15.250 --> 00:56:20.250
Use the opportunity to get to know more of your brothers and sisters

00:56:20.250 --> 00:56:25.250
at the regional or international convention you attend.

00:56:25.250 --> 00:56:31.250
To conclude this month's program, let's visit our brothers in Turkey.

00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:38.250
Turkey is a nation of more than 80 million people and a land rich in Bible history.

00:56:38.250 --> 00:56:42.250
Turkey occupies a unique geographic position,

00:56:42.250 --> 00:56:45.250
bridging Europe and Asia.

00:56:45.250 --> 00:56:49.250
It's here that Noah's Ark came to rest near Mount Ararat,

00:56:49.250 --> 00:56:52.250
Turkey's highest mountain.

00:56:52.250 --> 00:56:56.250
This is the land of the congregations in Colossi and Galatia,

00:56:56.250 --> 00:57:01.250
as well as all seven congregations mentioned in Revelation.

00:57:01.250 --> 00:57:04.250
The territories diverse and vast,

00:57:04.250 --> 00:57:11.250
with a publisher to population ratio of one to more than 26,000.

00:57:11.250 --> 00:57:16.250
In the capital city of Ankara, a single congregation is working hard

00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:20.250
to reach almost five and a half million people.

00:57:20.250 --> 00:57:27.250
Many congregations in Turkey focus on public witnessing with encouraging results.

00:57:27.250 --> 00:57:33.250
Let's visit the Hattai congregation near the ancient city of Syrian Antioch.

00:57:33.250 --> 00:57:38.250
Paul used Antioch as his home base for his missionary tours.

00:57:38.250 --> 00:57:44.250
And it was here that the disciples were first called Christians.

00:57:44.250 --> 00:57:49.250
Today, this part of Turkey is known for its food,

00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:54.250
such as spices, herbs, fruits, and sweets.

00:57:54.250 --> 00:57:59.250
In recent times, unrest and war had disrupted the region.

00:57:59.250 --> 00:58:04.250
Some of our brothers and sisters have been so near to the conflict

00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:09.250
that they could hear explosions from bombs and gunfire.

00:58:09.250 --> 00:58:12.250
Despite these threats and anxieties,

00:58:12.250 --> 00:58:17.250
the 56 publishers, including 11 regular pioneers

00:58:17.250 --> 00:58:23.250
and two special pioneers, attend the meetings and preach without let up.

00:58:23.250 --> 00:58:27.250
Our brothers and sisters in Turkey send their love and greetings

00:58:27.250 --> 00:58:29.250
to the worldwide brotherhood.

00:58:29.250 --> 00:58:34.250
Our love goes back to them for their zeal and steadfast faith.

00:58:34.250 --> 00:58:37.250
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:58:37.250 --> 00:58:40.250
this is JW Broadcasting.
