00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:42.689
The first class of Gilead was made up of 100 brothers,

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:47.689
and these 100 brothers were divided into three different groups.

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:56.689
The school was new for everyone.

00:00:56.689 --> 00:01:01.689
The instructors spent a lot of time before Gilead school started

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:11.750
mimographing all the material to be used in class.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.750
Brother Nor would come at times to give a talk.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.750
He assigned me to work in the Bethel in Rio de Janeiro.

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:30.579
We came to Brazil on an airplane,

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:35.579
because the Nazis were sinking ships in the Atlantic,

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.579
and the Japanese were sinking ships in the Pacific.

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:56.079
I arrived here on November 17, 1945.

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:02.739
At the end of that month, there were 200 publishers.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.520
The following year, there were 200 more.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:20.280
After that, every year thanks to the establishment of missionary homes

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.280
and the preaching work in the big cities,

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:32.900
the work kept growing.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.909
In Bethel, we learned about the problems

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:42.909
and helped the preaching work in Brazil.

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:46.909
The media gave some negative publicity about us,

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:53.319
and we were told we had to leave the country within 10 days.

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.319
This happened twice, because the first time,

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.319
Venuncio, he was our lawyer.

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.319
Venuncio prevented it from happening.

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.319
He took the lead in making publicity in our favor.

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:29.039
After this, the missionaries were followed by the Maritime Police,

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:35.039
and the Maritime Police that followed me learned the truth,

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:39.039
because they attended the meetings with me.

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:42.039
Yes.

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:55.599
When we see a need to renew our resolve,

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:58.599
we must follow Bible teachings.

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:03.599
Do the preaching work despite what the authorities may do,

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.599
because when all is said and done,

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:11.599
things will work out just like Jehovah wants them to.
