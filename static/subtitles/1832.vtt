00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.759
My name is Malumak.

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:20.760
No one can imagine how much Jehovah has helped me.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:29.780
I was raised in Sicimia, in Greenland.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.780
My childhood was wonderful.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.780
We were very often out in nature.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.780
In the summer we sailed, and in the winter we rode dogslets,

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.780
and we went hunting and fishing.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.289
When I was a child, I was very close to my parents.

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.289
I was a daddy's girl.

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:50.289
He called me my beloved.

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:53.289
So, beloved became my nickname.

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.289
It has been so wonderful to be raised in the truth.

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.289
The greatest gift that I could get is to know Jehovah through them.

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:08.519
When I was nine years old, my parents got divorced.

00:01:08.519 --> 00:01:10.519
It was terrible.

00:01:10.519 --> 00:01:13.519
I saw how my siblings were hurt.

00:01:13.519 --> 00:01:18.519
It cannot be explained how, I mean, we were very wounded in our hearts.

00:01:18.519 --> 00:01:21.519
When my parents divorced, my father was disfellowshipped.

00:01:21.519 --> 00:01:24.519
It was very hard to be separated like that.

00:01:24.519 --> 00:01:28.519
I missed my dad a lot.

00:01:28.519 --> 00:01:33.519
When my mom started to drink, I also felt abandoned.

00:01:33.519 --> 00:01:36.519
Because I knew what she had been doing.

00:01:36.519 --> 00:01:40.519
I was not surprised when after some time, she was disfellowshipped.

00:01:40.519 --> 00:01:43.519
But of course, I felt very hurt and sad.

00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:51.920
I supplicated Jehovah to help me stay in the truth.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.920
The pioneer sister that studied with me helped me a lot.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:05.019
She studied with me, sometimes took me on the ministry and invited me to dinner.

00:02:05.019 --> 00:02:09.020
When I was about 12 years old, my father came back into the truth.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:15.000
I was very happy that it finally happened.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I began to have a good relationship with him again.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
He sailed a lot, drove snowmobile and rode dog slitch.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And my father and I watched movies in the evening.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I remember that when my dad heard that I was going to be baptized, he shed a tear.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:43.150
And I could see he was proud.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.150
When I was 15 years old, my world fell to pieces.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.099
My father committed suicide.

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.099
It's difficult to describe that my father was suddenly gone.

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:06.460
I can't understand why he would do such a selfish thing.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.659
I missed him a lot.

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:14.659
It was like my heart was stabbed.

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:27.389
I was also very angry at him.

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.389
I wrote a lot.

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:35.389
And I wrote many letters to my father about things I wanted to tell him.

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:40.800
I also cried out to Jehovah in long prayers.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:47.800
I loved some 34-18 about Jehovah being close to those who were crushed in spirit.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.800
That was how I felt.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.800
And the thought that Jehovah is close to them comforts me a lot.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.800
I also did all I could to go to all the meetings.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.800
Even when I didn't want to see anyone.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.800
Even if I cried before the meeting.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.169
I went anyway.

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:14.169
After my father's death, I got baptized.

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:17.170
I got baptized because I loved Jehovah.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:23.639
When I was 9 years old, I had promised Jehovah to serve him for the rest of my life.

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:31.129
My relationship with my mother is much better now.

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:34.129
It is great to serve Jehovah together with her now.

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:38.629
We preach together every Sunday.

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:42.629
And I always look forward to going on the ministry together with her.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.490
When I was 18 years old, I began to help in the remote translation office.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.490
Later, I started pioneering.

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.490
I have always learned a lot from King David.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.490
No matter what circumstance he faced, whether bad or good,

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:10.160
he used them to draw close to Jehovah.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.160
Jehovah has helped me to overcome challenges through the congregation.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.160
Giving me power beyond what is normal.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.160
Taking me in as his daughter.
