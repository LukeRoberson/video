00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:07.320
Perhaps for us, our past mistakes are keeping us from moving forward.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.599
That was a challenge for Jim Lloyd.

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.160
He was raised in the truth, but did not progress to baptism.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.280
By his teen years he was getting into trouble, as he describes it in his heart he had left

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.760
Jehovah.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.559
His later involvement with gangs and violence put him in a place he never expected to

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:27.879
be.

00:00:27.879 --> 00:00:33.560
But you will be greatly encouraged to see where he is now.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:39.119
Things that have happened to you can't change, but your personality you can, and we can't

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:42.960
change our personality, which Jehovah's help.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.600
By the time I was 25, I was associating with notorious criminals.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.799
I guess I was criminal too.

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:52.840
This took a wrong turn and kept going.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.280
I found myself a fugitive on the run.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.479
I was sentenced to many years in prison.

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:06.040
In 25, I felt like it might as well have been a life sentence.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:16.920
Isolation locked down, very lonely place, and I thought, how did I get here?

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.920
I remember a happier time in my life.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.200
My mom would take us to meetings.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.920
I was in the Democratic Ministry school.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.599
All the friends were so loving.

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:34.840
My mom sent me subscriptions to the watchtower in Wake.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:42.959
I had a box under my bunk, and I tossed them in there, never opened them.

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:44.959
And I must have had a year's worth.

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:52.519
You know, I never told her, stop sending a mom, I'm not reading him.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.659
I found out through my mom that my dad had died.

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.709
I felt that I broke his heart.

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:08.270
I pulled out the box from under my bunk.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:15.669
Right on top was a book, the truth that leads to eternal life.

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:21.680
And at that moment, I knew Jehovah hadn't forgotten me.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.319
I remembered that book.

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.680
I remembered that book when I was a boy.

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:31.530
I placed that book out in service.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:39.090
I opened it up, and of course, that the theme scripture for that publication was Revelation 21, 3 and 4.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.289
Ten of God is with mankind.

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:45.969
I read that night, the whole night I read the whole book.

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:48.449
Course that little bell went off.

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:50.650
Couldn't deny that this was the truth.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.620
So what was I going to do about it?

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.300
Shortly after that, I got transferred.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.340
So I called my mom and told her, it was funny.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.900
She asked, do you think there's any Jehovah's Witnesses that go up there?

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.419
I told her, I don't think so.

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:06.699
It's way up in the mountains.

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:08.580
I don't think they go up there.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.659
It's a little fire at camp.

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:14.379
I wasn't a spiritual person yet.

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:24.159
All the magazines and books went back into the box and back under my bunk.

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:30.199
Only been there five minutes, and the guard comes in and said, are you a Jehovah's Witness?

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:31.879
I couldn't believe it.

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:36.400
And I told my study to have been studying with Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.759
And he said, oh, good, follow me.

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:46.479
And I followed him and he took me and introduced me to a brother who had been coming up there regularly

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:50.599
to study the Bible with inmates there.

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:58.879
And I realized at that moment that once again, Jehovah had not forgotten me.

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:06.280
A brother faithfully came up there for the next two years every Friday night.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.759
He thought that if you could idea to, how about the Acratic Mystery School?

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:11.000
So he got it approved.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.039
He would do the number one talk and the other brother that would come with them,

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:20.000
to do the highlights and then the three of us inmates would do the other parts.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.079
I was giving a talk every week.

00:04:23.079 --> 00:04:27.560
And he started making tape recordings of the meetings.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.870
I listened to him over and over until the next week.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:38.110
I knew that if I was going to return to Jehovah, I had to make some adjustments.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.029
Which Jehovah's help.

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:42.310
I leaned on him more, relied on his strength more.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.589
It was then that I really felt that I could do this.

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:52.269
The beard became a goatee and then it just became a mustache.

00:04:52.269 --> 00:04:56.629
No drugs, no alcohol, no smoking, clean in my language.

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:00.470
Then I finally got released.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:10.230
I got a job as an electrician and was able to get my own place and started going to meetings.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.350
I was listening to the watchtower and different ones were commenting,

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.189
oh, that's his wife.

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:19.709
One of the brothers that came up to visit me.

00:05:19.709 --> 00:05:26.629
I kept looking to see so I could finally put a face to the voices that I'd been listening to.

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:32.550
I let Jehovah mold me and to something good.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.910
So how could this picture be?

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.709
Many blessings since getting my life to Jehovah.

00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:40.350
I've been an elder for 10 years now.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.709
One of my sons came into the truth.

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:45.110
I met my wonderful wife.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:51.470
She's helped me to grow spiritually and to love Jehovah even more.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:57.670
One thing I can pray for, and he's blessed me with, is to forgive myself, to have a clean

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:02.149
conscience and bring us the speech, and he's done that.
