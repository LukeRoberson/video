00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:08.750
They were speechless when they heard she would leave home and join full-time service.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:15.949
Instead of pursuing their common goals, dreams and hopes, she would do whatever she was told to do.

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:24.149
What is sacrifice? They were so proud of her and they started thinking about what to do in order to support her.

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:30.309
Who are we talking about? Let us open to Judges 11.

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:36.310
And let's find out who they were and what they did.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:45.270
They are soon to be graduates. What they did is something that will help you to succeed in your

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:56.070
assignment. Let's read please Judges 11 verse 40. From year to year, the young women of Israel

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:04.230
would go to give commendation to the daughter of Jeff DeGilia died four days in the year.

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:13.750
The young women of Israel went to the sanctuary in Shiloh in order to give commendation and praise

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.510
to the daughter of Jeff DeGilia. Commendation strengthened this full-time servant of Jehovah.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.950
Is this not what you want to do too? So that's why we have the question for you.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:34.790
How often will you go to Shiloh? Will you strengthen others and stabilize the organization by

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:43.349
regularly commending and praising others? Let us therefore ask the following questions. What type of

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:50.790
commendation is effective in strengthening others? How can you imitate the young women of Israel and

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.269
why do you want to give commendation regularly? Let's start with the first question.

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.030
What type of commendation is effective in strengthening others? And let us please look at the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:11.909
example that Jesus said as we turn to Mark chapter 5. Here he comments the frightened sick woman

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:20.389
who touched his outer garment. As we read Mark chapter 5 verse 354, please watch out for five

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:35.349
elements of effective commendation. Mark 5 verse 34, he said to her, daughter, your faith has made

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:43.909
you well. Go in peace and be healed from your crevice sickness. Did you know what made this

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:52.469
commendation effective? First, effective commendation is specific. Jesus commanded the woman

00:02:52.469 --> 00:03:02.389
for what she did. Her faith moved her to act. Effective commendation is sincere. The woman's faith

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:11.030
was real and outstanding. Did you notice that Jesus did not use the opportunity to counsel her

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:17.509
for violating the law? This might have made his commendation sound insincere.

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:26.870
Third, effective commendation is personal. Jesus used the expression, daughter, that expression

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:35.270
emphasized his tender concern for her. Fourth, effective commendation is more than words. Jesus

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:43.990
acknowledged the needs of the woman and followed up with deeds. He healed her. And fifth, effective

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:51.349
commendation is unselfish. Jesus did not commend the woman in order to make himself look good,

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.870
but he was concerned about her and wanted to make her feel good. Now, can you do the same?

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:07.509
Let's go back to Judges 11 and let's look again at verse 40. So this is Judges 11, verse 40.

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:11.509
And let's answer the second question, how can you imitate the young women of Israel?

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:21.189
So the verse started here in verse 40 saying, from year to year. So this means regularly,

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:31.670
repeatedly. The young women would praise the same person again and again. In your assignment,

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.149
as you work with others in Bethel in the ministry or watch them in your congregation,

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:43.509
can you repeatedly praise them? For instance, could you praise them for their zeal,

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:50.790
their fine efforts or for their acts of love? Could you send an up building text message saying,

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:58.470
great job, well done, thumbs up, loved it. Maybe along with the brief comment,

00:04:59.269 --> 00:05:05.350
these messages do not require a lot of effort and time, but they can go a long way.

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:13.430
One time is not enough. Do it again and again. Don't worry, the person could get a big head.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:21.110
In the Bible, Jehovah praised and commanded the persons that he loved repeatedly.

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:30.069
Commending others again and again is a good thing. Now, the verse continues here saying,

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:35.589
the young women of Israel would go to give commendation to the daughter of Jeff Ta, the Gilead

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:44.389
died four days in the year. Being away from their family obligation must have been a sacrifice.

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:51.990
Somebody else must have taken over their usual work. They had to travel to Shiloh,

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:59.110
and they may also have brought a gift. Now could this serve as a reminder that giving

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:06.069
commendation might sometimes require a little bit more time and effort? Can come at a personal cost?

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:17.750
Yes. Calling somebody or visiting him requires time and effort. Spending time with your brother

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:24.629
and sister honors them. Being out with them in the ministry, working together on the project

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:32.790
or asking them for advice really makes them feel good and can be a powerful commendation.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:42.470
It's worth all it costs. Timing is important too. Proverbs 15, verse 23 states,

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:51.029
a word spoken at the right time. How good is it? So what is the right time for commendation?

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:58.069
The verses leading up to our theme scripture here mentioned that Jeff does daughter right away

00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:05.189
got much needed support. So generally speaking, commendation is of greatest value when it's given

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:12.790
as soon as the opportunity comes up, even if it's initially just a brief comment.

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:19.829
The sooner somebody receives positive feedback, the quicker feelings of insecurity or doubts will

00:07:19.829 --> 00:07:27.589
vanish and the sooner the other person will be happy and feel good. Please do not wait too long

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:35.589
but act right away. Now this leads us to our third and final question. Why do you want to give

00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:44.069
commendation regularly? As you go to your assignments, you will be surrounded by many daughters

00:07:44.149 --> 00:07:50.790
of chapter, faithful, full-time servants of Jehovah who made sacrifices to serve.

00:07:51.589 --> 00:08:01.350
This auditorium is full of them and you are among them. You will meet brothers and sisters

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:10.709
in the congregation and some of them are insecure, worried. Sometimes doubt that they are worth

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:17.350
anything. They are giving their very best to stay faithful despite challenges, fighting with their

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:23.910
own imperfection, dealing with the results of their own mistakes and are sometimes discouraged

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:34.389
because of setbacks. They need commendation. We all need commendation. Because commendation

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:39.669
enhances a person's self-esteem, it builds confidence and motivates to action.

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:48.629
It reinforces our desire to do good things and it encourages us to keep on doing our very best.

00:08:48.629 --> 00:08:56.710
Please go to Shiloh as often as possible. Now there's another important aspect.

00:08:58.149 --> 00:09:03.830
The reality is that when you work closely with brothers and sisters, you see their

00:09:04.789 --> 00:09:14.629
flaws and mistakes. So what you're going to do? Will you ignore that person? Or will you try to imitate

00:09:14.629 --> 00:09:23.110
Jehovah who is searching for the good in us? Make it a habit to search for the good and then give

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:34.070
voice to the positive. Now what happens to us if we are doing it bad way? It can change us.

00:09:35.429 --> 00:09:45.590
It can change us from being a complainer to being a commander. A commander focuses on the good

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:56.309
in others. He sees the others with Jehovah's eyes. A commander is very happy because he sees

00:09:57.029 --> 00:10:05.320
all the beauty around him. So if you gain a reputation for commanding rather than complaining,

00:10:06.679 --> 00:10:11.480
you will succeed in your assignment because others will love to work with you.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:19.879
They are soon to be graduates of the 151st Class of Gilead. Please make commanding and praising others

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:28.360
part of your personality, something that comes naturally. So often will you go to Shiloh?

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:35.320
Please go to Shiloh as often as possible.
