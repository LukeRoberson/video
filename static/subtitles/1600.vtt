Jehovah, I'm so sorry. Yeah. Can you ever forgive me? What Manasseh did was shocking,

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:22.879
but was he a lost cause? Was he beyond hope? Let's read 2 Chronicles chapter 33 verse 12,

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:33.949
and as soon as he calls him to stress, he softened the face of Jehovah his God. Jehovah for

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:44.270
gave Manasseh. What can we learn from that? When a person sends even seriously and shows true

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:52.030
repentance by abandoning his wrong cause and making every effort to do what is right, he's not a

00:02:52.030 --> 00:03:03.629
lost cause. He's not beyond hope. I'm a loving God, Jehovah, will forgive him in a large way.

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:13.650
Because by tomorrow night we should be in the clear. We'll have the complete forecast with all the

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:21.169
details for you right after sports. Well, looks like we're going to be working indoors one more day.

00:03:21.169 --> 00:04:46.000
Better get to bed. Well, don't forget, honey, trash pickup is tomorrow. That's right. I missed you so much.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:05:03.600
I'm so sorry. I please come home.
