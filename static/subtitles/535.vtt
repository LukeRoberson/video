00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:07.980
The theme for my discussion is never let Satan intimidate you.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.980
To intimidate means to try to get someone to do or not do something by bullying,

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.980
terrorizing, threatening them, and, of course, Satan is a God of intimidation.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.980
That's one way he tries to get people to do what he wants.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.980
On the other hand, Jehovah always motivates by love.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.979
The word intimidate is found twice in the study Bible notes,

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:37.979
and the word intimidated is found once in the main text of our Bible,

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:44.979
Deuteronomy 117, where the judges who were to assist Moses were told

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:49.979
do not be intimidated by men, render impartial judgment.

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:54.979
But now, even though these words are not used so much in the Bible,

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:57.979
the idea is found many times.

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:02.979
As a few examples, think of Goliath, who was nine-and-a-half feet tall,

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:05.980
trying to intimidate young David.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.980
Remember what he said to him?

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.980
First Samuel chapter 17, he said, just come to me,

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.980
and I will give your flesh to the birds of the heavens and to the beast of the field.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.980
Just come to me, little boy, and I'll feed your corpse to the buzzards and hyenas.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.980
Big time intimidation.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.980
Or what about the rapshika in loud, fluent Hebrew trying to intimidate the Jews

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.980
in the time of Hezekiah?

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:41.980
Sand ballot in Tobiah, trying to ridicule Nehemiah and the Jews for building the wall.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.980
Or another example found in today's Watchtower comments,

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.980
Nebuchadnezzar really tried to intimidate the three Hebrews into worshipping

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.980
an idol. How did he do it?

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.980
Well, Daniel 3 verse 1 says, he erected an immense image,

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.980
almost 90 feet tall, 9 feet wide.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.980
And that was intimidating in itself.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.979
But then he assembled, according to verse 2,

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.979
a huge strong of people, say traps, prefects, governors, advisors, et cetera, et cetera,

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:18.979
intimidating throng.

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:23.979
And then verses 4 through 6, he had it loudly proclaimed,

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:25.979
you are commanded.

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:31.979
When you hear the horn, the pipe, the zither, you must fall down and worship this image.

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:38.979
And anyone who does not do so immediately will be thrown into the burning fiery furnace,

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:40.979
very intimidating.

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:45.979
But those three Hebrews remained unintimidated.

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:50.979
But of course, Satan, as we said, tries to still use intimidation today.

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:55.979
If you don't take this blood transfusion, you will surely die.

00:02:55.979 --> 00:03:00.979
If you don't accept this job, talking about a job that will damage you spiritually,

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:03.979
your family will starve.

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:07.979
Why won't you smoke this cigarette, are you afraid, are you chicken?

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:11.979
Why won't you date this girl in your class who likes you?

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:13.979
Are you a homosexual?

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:17.979
Today, Satan uses intimidation.

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:22.979
Verse 5-8 says, the devil walks about like a roaring lion.

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:27.979
And often, those roars take the form of intimidation,

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:31.979
kind of like the roars of a literal lion,

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:37.979
according to the insight book, or calculated to cause domestic animals to stampede

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:40.979
and break out of their protective enclosure.

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:47.979
But now, here's a question, what lessons can we learn from those three Hebrews

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:51.979
that will help us to never let Satan intimidate us?

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:53.979
Well, here are a few lessons.

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:58.979
One, never quit trusting Jehovah with all your heart,

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:01.979
despite the roars of the devil.

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:08.979
If you go to Daniel chapter 3, notice how they put implicit trust in Jehovah,

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:11.979
despite this intimidating situation.

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:18.980
Chapter 3, verse 16, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered the king,

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.980
oh, never can nether, we have no need to answer you in this matter.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.980
If it must be, our God whom we serve is able to rescue us

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.980
from the burning, fiery furnace, O King, and to rescue us from your hand.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.980
But even if he does not, let it be known to you, O King,

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:44.980
that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold that you have set out.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.980
See, they trusted Jehovah.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.980
Now, here's another lesson.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.980
Holy Spirit will help us remain calm, not panic,

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.980
give a good answer to our persecutors.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.980
When you think about what we just read, the answer they gave, amazing composure,

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.980
amazing answer they gave.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.980
Obviously, Holy Spirit was working powerfully upon them,

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.980
and we're promised the same will be true of us.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.980
At Luke 12, 11 and 12, Jesus said when they bring you before public assemblies,

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:23.980
government officials, authorities, don't be anxious about what you will say.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.980
The Holy Spirit will teach you in that hour what to say.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.980
Now, here's another lesson.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:38.980
Jehovah can use his powerful angels to rescue us from an intimidating situation.

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.980
In the case of the three Hebrews, they were rescued miraculously.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:49.980
When the King looked into that furnace, instead of seeing three men bound being cremated,

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:55.980
he saw four walking about freely, the fourth obviously, an angel.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.980
Now, when they were brought out of that furnace,

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.980
Daniel 327 says they didn't even have the smell of fire.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.980
No hair of their body was singed.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.980
Now, we've been in homes where people are smokers,

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.980
and you pick up that smell of smoke very easily.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.980
Talking about singing your hair, hair of singes very easily.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:19.980
Some time back, I tried to light a gas stove using a match.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.980
I didn't get the timing exactly right.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.980
It blew back, burned about half the hair as off my arm.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.980
But here they didn't have a hair senged, not even the smell of smoke.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:37.980
Now, today, we don't expect Jehovah's angels to deliver us miraculously.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:42.980
But Jehovah can use them to maneuver circumstances.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.980
So we find a job to provide for our family.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:52.980
So we find a cooperative doctor who respects our stand on blood as just a couple of examples.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:59.980
Or he may use the angels to strengthen us, to be faithful in the face of that fiery test.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.980
Now, here's another lesson we can learn.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:06.980
Firm belief in the resurrection can powerfully fortify us,

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.980
even if we're threatened with death.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:14.980
Undoubtedly, those three Hebrews, new Job's words of Job 1413,

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.980
where Job asked Jehovah to conceal him in the grave,

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:23.980
set a time limit, and then remember him, resurrect him.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.980
Likely, they were familiar with the resurrections of Elijah and Elijah.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.980
Now, they didn't know if they'd be miraculously delivered,

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:35.980
but they did know they would be resurrected if they kept their integrity.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.980
The same is true with us today.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.980
And that firm belief in the resurrection, if you think about it,

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:47.980
stripped Satan of his power to intimidate us, even in the face of death.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:51.980
You could say that hope is like our secret weapon.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:53.980
Now, here's one more lesson we can learn.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.980
Remaining staunchly unintimidated,

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:00.980
will give a powerful witness to onlookers.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.980
Do you remember what the King said when they came out unharmed?

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:11.980
From that furnace, he said, praise be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:16.980
For there is no other God who is able to rescue like this one.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:19.980
And think about this.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:24.980
If Nebuchadnezzar and other Babylonian onlookers are resurrected

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.980
as part of the unrighteous mention in Acts 24-15,

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:32.980
this experience will give them a head start in the New World

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:34.980
on taking a stand, would you, Hova?

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:38.980
And think about even the men who threw them into the furnace,

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:40.980
who died doing so.

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.980
Now, if they're resurrected, they'll be told about what happened

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.980
subsequent to their untimely death.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:52.980
And undoubtedly, that will be an impetus to a spiritual progress in the New World.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.980
Well, the same is true today.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:57.980
When we stand firm unintimidated,

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.980
we give a powerful witness,

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:04.980
and are many that are now in the truth as a result of such witness.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:10.980
Well, there we have five anti-intimidation lessons.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.980
We can learn from those three Hebrews.

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:19.980
In review, never quit trusting Jehovah despite the roars of the devil.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:22.980
Two, Holy Spirit will help us remain calm, not panic.

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:24.980
Give a good answer.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:29.980
Three, Jehovah can use his angels in various ways to rescue us

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:32.980
from intimidating circumstances.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:37.980
And number four, the resurrection hope will powerfully fortify us

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:41.980
not to be intimidated, even in the face of death.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:46.980
And number five, remaining staunchly unintimidated,

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:50.980
who will give a profound witness to onlookers.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.980
So make all of us, like those three Hebrews,

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:59.980
be determined to never let Satan intimidate us.
