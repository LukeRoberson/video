00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:08.169
Imagine you just learned that you had received an amazing inheritance, something very special

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:15.169
that had been in your family for many years, and the gift is very valuable, how would you feel?

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:22.170
Actually, all of us, everyone listening to this program have received such an inheritance.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:29.170
It's something that's been passed down from generation to generation for thousands of years.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.170
What is it?

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.170
It's God's Word, the Bible.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:40.170
Through this precious gift, we feel Jehovah's love in what ways?

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.170
Let's consider three.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:51.170
We feel it when we learn how Jehovah has preserved his Word for thousands of years so that we'd have it today.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.170
We feel it in the message it conveys from our loving Heavenly Father.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:04.170
And we feel it when we see how our lives are improved when we apply its teachings.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.170
Let's talk about the first.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.170
Jehovah's love is felt in the way that he preserved his Word.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:20.170
The Bible was written so long ago on perishable materials, and yet we have it today.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.170
We have it on our phones and tablets, and we have printed copies.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:34.170
Consider what a miracle it is that Jehovah had the Bible written down, hand copied for centuries,

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.170
and yet it was accurately preserved until our day.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.170
How was the Bible written?

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.170
In a miraculous way.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.170
2 Timothy chapter 3 and verse 16 clearly states,

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.170
All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:02.170
Yes, Jehovah used his Holy Spirit to convey his thoughts to the minds and hearts of faithful men.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.170
Some 40 writers were used.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:14.169
1600 years passed until the Bible was completed in about the year 98 CE.

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:18.169
That's more than 1,900 years ago.

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:22.169
So how is it that we have the Bible today?

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:25.169
It had to be hand copied.

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:29.169
Through the centuries, scribes made copies of the text.

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:36.169
For example, the Maserites, a group of meticulous Jewish scholars and copyists,

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:43.169
literally counted the number of words and even the number of letters.

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:44.169
Why?

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:53.169
To make sure that they copied the text accurately, they wanted no errors to be introduced.

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:58.169
Thankfully, many ancient Bible manuscripts have survived until today.

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:08.169
Perhaps some 6,000 manuscripts of the Hebrew Scriptures and some 5,000 of the Christian Greek Scriptures.

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:14.169
By the 15th century, the Bible had been hand copied for hundreds of years.

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:18.169
But now, that was about to change.

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:26.169
Let me show you what happened using a few examples from our Bible collection in Warwick, New York.

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:29.169
This is what's often called a Paris Bible.

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:34.169
It was completed in France during the latter part of the 13th century.

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:39.169
That is, somewhere between the years 1250 and 1300.

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:43.169
It's a complete Bible copied by hand.

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:46.169
Look at how beautiful it is.

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:54.169
Imagine the work involved, a scribe sitting at a table, day after day, carefully copying,

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:57.169
so that someone could have a Bible like this.

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:06.169
Of course, few people would ever have been able to own a precious hand copied Bible like this one.

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:09.169
But Jehovah had something better in mind.

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:17.170
So, in the 15th century, a man named Johannes Gutenberg came up with an amazing idea.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:24.170
In about the year 1455, Gutenberg produced the first printed Bible.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.170
He printed only about 180 copies.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.170
That doesn't sound like a lot today, does it?

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:37.170
But remember, up until that time, every Bible had been hand copied.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.170
So this was something truly amazing.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:48.170
Here's an original page from one of those 180 Bibles printed by Gutenberg.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.170
It's beautiful, isn't it?

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.170
But this was just the beginning.

00:04:54.170 --> 00:05:04.170
In time, Gutenberg's invention would allow for thousands of copies of the Bible to be printed in a relatively short period of time.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:11.170
In the years that followed, printing presses gradually were set up in various cities in Europe.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.170
What were they able to produce?

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:21.170
In 1475, Bernard Rieshel produced this Bible in Basel, Switzerland.

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:26.170
Look at the size of it, and look at the beautiful printing.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:31.170
It's amazing what those early printers were able to produce.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:36.170
Although the Bible was now being printed, there was still a problem.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.170
What was it?

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:43.170
Few people would ever have been able to afford a Bible like this.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:48.170
Even though it was printed, it was still very expensive.

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:55.170
This Bible was probably produced for a church, or for someone who was very wealthy.

00:05:55.170 --> 00:06:01.170
But less than 20 years later, there was another exciting development.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:07.170
This is the Biblia Integra, often called the Poor Man's Bible.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:12.170
It was printed in Switzerland in the year 1491.

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.170
What do you notice about it?

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.170
It's very small.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:21.170
It's thought to be the first small-sized printed Bible.

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:25.170
The man who produced this Bible had a new idea.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:29.170
He produced this Bible to appeal to common churchgoers.

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:33.170
It wasn't a Bible for a library, or a church.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:41.170
It was for personal use, something that a person could own, and carry with him, and read at any time.

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.170
Why was this development so important?

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:52.170
Because in the next few decades, the Bible would be translated from the original languages,

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:58.170
and printed in the vernacular, or common languages, of people across Europe.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:07.170
For the first time, it would be possible for people to have a personal copy of the Bible in their own language.

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:17.170
These significant developments in Bible production give us reason to believe that our loving father, Jehovah, was involved.

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:27.170
He not only had preserved the Bible, but now he was ensuring that his gift would be made available to all people.

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:31.990
Now, let's return to the studio.

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:37.990
Of course, God's enemies did not want people to have Jehovah's precious gift.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:45.990
Thus, it's not surprising that many people have actively worked to prevent others from having the Bible.

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:49.990
One scholar, Albert Barnes, described it this way.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:08:02.990
No book has excited so much opposition as this, but it has survived every attack which power, talent, and eloquence have ever made on it.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:08.990
No army ever survived so many battles as the Bible.

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:15.990
Humans alone could never have preserved the Bible in the face of such strong opposition.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:19.990
It's a miracle that we have it today.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:30.990
Clearly, we feel the love of Jehovah when we see how he's preserved the Bible and made this precious gift available to all.

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:35.990
The Bible's message is a second way that we feel Jehovah's love.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:40.990
The Bible teaches us things that we cannot learn anywhere else.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:50.990
Through, without the Bible, we could understand that there is a creator and we could learn about his qualities from the things he's made.

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:54.990
But the Bible teaches us so much more.

00:08:54.990 --> 00:09:02.990
In it, Jehovah tells us his own personal name, the purpose of life, and what the future holds.

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:09.990
These are things that we'd expect a loving father to share with his beloved children.

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:19.990
Jehovah invites us to have a close relationship with him, what a tender and loving father.

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:27.990
The practical guidance for life that the Bible contains is a third way that we feel Jehovah's love.

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:33.990
It's a book from the creator that instructs us how to live a happy and satisfying life.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:41.990
It's like our owner's manual from the creator himself and how much we need it.

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:45.990
Jesus saw how much people needed that guidance.

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:48.990
Matthew 9.36 says,

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:57.990
On seeing the crowds, he felt pity for them because they were skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:00.990
That's true today also.

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:04.990
People are so confused and lost.

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:06.990
They don't know what to do.

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:10.990
They're often guided simply by their own thinking and desires.

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:15.990
As a result, people end up in awful situations.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:24.990
We need reliable guidance to show us what's right and what's wrong and to help us find the way to happiness.

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:30.990
And Jehovah has provided all of that in his precious gift, the Bible.

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:33.990
Romans 15 verse 4 says,

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:39.990
For all the things that were written beforehand were written for our instruction

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:46.990
so that through our endurance and through the comfort from the scriptures, we might have hope.

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:53.990
Even as our circumstances change, the Bible continues to be our manual for life.

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:59.990
Whether young or old, single or married, the guidance in God's word always applies.

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:02.990
It always works.

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:11.990
As we reflect on all the ways that the Bible is a unique gift, what do we see or feel?

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:18.990
We feel the tremendous love that Jehovah has for us in giving us this gift.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:26.990
He's made sure that all the information we need is inside it, and he helps us to apply it in our life.

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:28.990
With what result?

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:33.990
2 Timothy chapter 3 and verse 16 and 17 says,

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:42.990
All scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight,

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:49.990
for disciplining in righteousness, so that the man of God may be fully competent,

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:54.990
completely equipped for every good work.

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:58.990
What have we learned in this brief discussion?

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:03.990
Everything about the Bible reflects Jehovah's love.

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:06.990
The miraculous way he preserved it.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:13.990
It's message from a loving Father and its practical guidance on how to live.

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:19.990
Inheriting a precious gift does not guarantee that we will appreciate it.

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:25.990
Likewise, simply having a Bible does not mean that we'll benefit from it.

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:32.990
To benefit, we need to read His Word, the manual for life, every day.

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:41.990
As we read and study the Bible, we feel the great love of its author, our wonderful God, Jehovah.

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:47.990
And the more we feel His love, the more we're moved to do what He wants us to do.

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:53.990
That includes helping others to receive and benefit from this precious gift.

00:12:53.990 --> 00:13:04.990
In this way, we can help as many as possible to experience, yes, to really feel the love of God through the Bible.
