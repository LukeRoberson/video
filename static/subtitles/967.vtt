00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:07.940
It's a simple fact that to be at peace with others, we must be willing to forgive.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.300
Please notice two examples.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.740
A father and his teenage daughter didn't get along.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.179
Minor disagreements often developed into shouting matches.

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:23.500
Finally, the tension got so bad that the daughter was asked to leave the house.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.859
Eventually, she recognized that she was at fault and asked for her father's forgiveness.

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.939
Instead of overlooking her mistakes, her father rejected her efforts.

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:40.259
He was unwilling to extend forgiveness to his own daughter.

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:43.579
Now let's contrast that with another example.

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.740
A blameless man was condemned to die for a crime he didn't commit.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.659
Shortly before he died, the innocent man stated,

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:58.259
Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:02.820
Those words of Jesus are recorded at Luke chapter 23 verse 34.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.019
And he may have been referring to the Roman soldiers who drove the nails into his hands and feet

00:01:08.019 --> 00:01:11.140
and who didn't know who he really was.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.659
Or Jesus may have had in mind some in the crowd who demanded his execution

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.700
but would later exercise faith in him.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:25.069
The point is that Jesus was willing to forgive freely.

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:28.790
How do we measure up with regard to forgiveness?

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.950
Are we like Jesus willing to forgive others freely?

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.760
Or at times do we tend to be more like the man who was unwilling to forgive?

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.439
Granting forgiveness isn't always easy.

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:48.799
Imperfection exerts a powerful influence over us, sometimes robbing us of compassion.

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:54.400
When someone hurts us, we may become resentful or hold a grudge.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.359
And perhaps some of us were taught not to forgive others.

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:04.879
Little wonder that cultivating a peaceful forgiving spirit can be difficult.

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:11.400
Still, the Bible encourages us to forgive freely.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.639
Let's consider another example of forgiveness in the man Job.

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:20.080
And we're familiar with his trials, loss of his possessions and ten children,

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.280
a loathsome disease, and his wife told him to curse God and die.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.879
Three companions heard about Job's calamities and they agreed to go comfort him.

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:34.280
Job chapter 2 verse 13 states that when they arrived,

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.240
they sat with him for seven days and seven nights, but they didn't say a word to him.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.319
Now maybe that was a good thing, because when they finally opened their mouths,

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.560
they deeply hurt Job with their baseless accusations.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.800
But notice something interesting about this account.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.840
Please turn with me to Job chapter 42.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.360
At the end of Job's trials, Jehovah asked Job to do something regarding these false

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.840
accusers.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:08.580
Notice Jehovah's words there, Job 42, the B portion of verse 8.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.139
And my servant Job will pray for you.

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:18.580
I will surely accept his request not to deal with you according to your foolishness.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.020
Did you notice?

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:26.939
After all the false accusations, Jehovah asked Job to pray for the men who had tormented him.

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:29.300
Now would Job tell Jehovah,

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.099
Jehovah, after what they said to me, I'm not going to forgive them.

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:36.939
Would Job be resentful?

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:40.979
Notice the latter portion of verse 9.

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:45.180
And Jehovah accepted Job's prayer.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.379
Job followed Jehovah's instructions.

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:53.259
What was the result of Job's integrity and his forgiving spirit?

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:55.300
Verse 10.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.620
After Job had prayed for his companions,

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.620
Jehovah removed Job's tribulation and restored his prosperity.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.500
Jehovah gave him double what he had before.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.780
The account was on to say that Job had 10 more children.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.979
He lived for 140 more years and for 17 states.

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:19.939
Finally, Job died after a long and satisfying life.

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:28.079
Job was blessed for his forgiving spirit and he set a good example for us to forgive freely.

00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:31.079
In the following dramatization with Celia and Haley,

00:04:31.079 --> 00:04:37.000
notice why Haley finally decides to forgive freely.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:05:07.439
I've been thinking of you.

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:10.120
How did you like the Neurological Sun?

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:17.490
Yes, I can't.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:23.829
So it's one of those treats transform your lives.

00:05:23.829 --> 00:05:33.899
I wish you could give her a rest.

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:34.699
Sorry?

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:37.939
Oh, nothing.

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:38.860
I'm sorry.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.699
It's just Emily for the millionth time.

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:43.379
What's the problem, love?

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:46.100
There's no problem.

00:05:46.459 --> 00:06:08.990
It's just difficult to let her back in.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.949
Not that simple.

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:14.699
Not that simple.

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:17.420
You want to forgive.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:23.670
But I'll get burned again.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:31.269
Keep in mind, a chance to forgive is a chance to imitate Jehovah.

00:06:31.269 --> 00:06:36.589
We wouldn't want to miss that opportunity.

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:39.750
I never thought about it like that.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:47.339
Think back to a time when you wanted forgiveness.

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:54.740
When it meant everything, how did it feel?

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.319
You feel awful.

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:01.040
That you've let everyone down.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:16.300
They forgive you.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:28.740
Suddenly everything's okay.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.860
Emily, sorry, I haven't been back to you.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:39.759
I've planned for tomorrow.

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:42.800
What good reasoning on the part of Celia?

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.000
Did you notice the expression that really touched Haley's heart?

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:51.199
A chance to forgive is a chance to imitate Jehovah.

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:54.720
We wouldn't want to miss that opportunity.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.120
So when we've been wronged, we don't want to miss the opportunity

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:02.439
to imitate Jehovah by forgiving freely.

00:08:02.439 --> 00:08:07.680
Please notice how this is highlighted at Colossians 3.13.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.959
When we consider Job's example, remember that Jehovah instructed him

00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:12.959
to pray for his companions.

00:08:12.959 --> 00:08:16.240
And that helped Job display a forgiving spirit.

00:08:16.279 --> 00:08:18.720
Well, notice here what Jehovah instructs us to do.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.899
Colossians 3.13.

00:08:21.899 --> 00:08:24.139
Continue putting up with one another

00:08:24.139 --> 00:08:27.339
and forgiving one another freely,

00:08:27.339 --> 00:08:30.300
even if anyone has a cause for a complaint against another.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:34.299
Just as Jehovah freely forgave you,

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:38.929
you must also do the same.

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:41.850
The Greek verb used here for freely forgive

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:46.049
is related to a word often rendered undeserved kindness or favor.

00:08:47.049 --> 00:08:49.210
When used in the sense of forgiving,

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:54.490
this verb conveys the idea of doing so freely, generously.

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:59.889
Just as when you, out of generosity, give a gift to someone.

00:08:59.889 --> 00:09:04.929
Jehovah requires that we freely forgive others in imitation of him.

00:09:04.929 --> 00:09:06.889
Did you notice the end of the verse?

00:09:06.889 --> 00:09:11.330
You must also do the same.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:15.330
Now, if the offense is minor, it's best to overlook it.

00:09:15.409 --> 00:09:18.289
First Corinthians chapter 13 verse five states that,

00:09:18.289 --> 00:09:21.529
love does not keep account of the injury.

00:09:21.529 --> 00:09:23.809
And Proverbs 19 verse 11 tells us

00:09:23.809 --> 00:09:27.129
that it is beauty to overlook an offense.

00:09:28.769 --> 00:09:31.490
However, if we feel that we need to talk to our brother

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:34.610
or a sister about an offense that was committed against us,

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:36.169
what's the best way to handle that?

00:09:37.409 --> 00:09:40.649
First, we should ask Jehovah in prayer for his guidance.

00:09:41.649 --> 00:09:44.730
Then, with the brother's good qualities in mind,

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:48.049
graciously tell him that we want to make peace.

00:09:48.049 --> 00:09:50.649
Listen carefully and empathetically.

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:53.250
We shouldn't interrupt,

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.289
even if we don't agree with everything being said.

00:09:56.289 --> 00:09:58.809
It may be that his viewpoint is wrong,

00:09:58.809 --> 00:10:00.610
but it is his viewpoint.

00:10:02.049 --> 00:10:06.210
Then when it's our turn to speak, we want to be gracious.

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.970
Tell the brother what we appreciate about him.

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:12.450
Apologize for any part that we played in the misunderstanding.

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:17.450
If our humble efforts result in good, thank Jehovah.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:21.450
If they don't, keep asking Jehovah for guidance

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:26.490
while we look for another opportunity to make peace.

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:28.330
When we truly forgive,

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.850
we make a heartfelt decision to let go of resentment

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:33.970
and what peace that can bring us.

00:10:35.129 --> 00:10:38.610
Now forgiving doesn't mean that we approve of a wrong action,

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:41.450
consider it unimportant or pretend it didn't happen.

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.690
Also, if we've been treated unjustly

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:46.929
and have a cause for complaint,

00:10:46.929 --> 00:10:50.370
we do what we can to pursue peace and resolve the matter,

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:55.460
and then we confidently leave it in Jehovah's hands.

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:57.100
Brothers and sisters, what will you take away

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:58.379
from this consideration?

00:10:59.379 --> 00:11:01.700
I'm sure you'll agree that it can be a challenge

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.059
at times to forgive,

00:11:04.259 --> 00:11:06.779
but rather than be like the man we spoke of earlier

00:11:06.779 --> 00:11:08.940
who refused to forgive his own daughter,

00:11:09.779 --> 00:11:12.379
may we follow the examples of Jehovah,

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:17.460
Jesus, Job, and Hailey by forgiving freely, generously.

00:11:18.419 --> 00:11:23.419
Remember, a chance to forgive is a chance to imitate Jehovah

00:11:23.659 --> 00:11:25.860
and we wouldn't want to miss that opportunity.

00:11:27.019 --> 00:11:32.019
May all of us pursue peace by being willing to forgive freely.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.039
For the Garret Loche, a member of the governing body

00:11:37.039 --> 00:11:40.000
will now present the final talk of this symposium.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.080
Seek peace and pursue it

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:45.000
by using our gift of speech wisely.
