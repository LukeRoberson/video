00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:07.490
Around the world, Jehovah's Witnesses show unfailing love.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.490
In the next hour, we'll hear reports that highlight real-life examples of such love.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:19.489
We'll consider how economic hardship, natural disasters, and political upheaval

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:25.489
give us the opportunity to show our unfailing love toward our brothers.

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:30.489
Later in the program, we'll see the immense support that's given to special preaching campaigns,

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.490
and to the construction of places of worship.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:41.490
All these examples will prove that Jehovah's Organization lives up to the words of 1st Peter to 17,

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.490
have love for the whole association of brothers.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:54.490
Additionally, many of the reports will highlight not only brotherly love, but also neighborly love.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:01.490
We do this by going to extraordinary lengths to preach despite many challenges.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:07.489
To get us started, let's see some examples of unfailing love in Africa.

00:01:07.489 --> 00:01:16.489
Specifically, we'll be talking about how our brothers thrive spiritually despite challenging economic circumstances.

00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:22.489
We now have the privilege of getting reports from brother Paul Rohadjani Rina,

00:01:22.489 --> 00:01:27.489
who serves on the Madagascar Branch Committee, from brother Buston Nurenda,

00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:32.489
who serves on the Malaway Branch Committee, and from brother Robert Elango,

00:01:32.489 --> 00:01:36.489
who serves on the Congo Kinshasa Branch Committee.

00:01:36.489 --> 00:01:45.489
First, brother Rohadjani Rina, how have our brothers in Madagascar experienced brotherly love?

00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:49.489
Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world,

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:55.489
and 80% of the population lives on less than $2 per day.

00:01:55.489 --> 00:02:00.489
So many cannot afford basic things such as healthcare.

00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:10.490
Our branch here in Madagascar keeps the governing body informed of how our brothers and sisters are doing.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.490
This has led to help from other branches.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:22.490
For example, a good team of witness nurses and doctors came from France on several occasions

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:30.490
to provide medical care for our brothers, the team travelled from village to village on bad runs,

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.490
and in the extreme heat.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.490
Our brothers benefited greatly from the visits.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:48.490
To illustrate, some of our dear older ones have bad hearing and cannot afford to go to a larger city for help.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:56.490
But our brothers with a medical team travelled to them and gave them proper care without charge.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.490
But for love they didn't stop there.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:07.490
These visiting volunteers also helped educate our local brothers on practical matters of hygiene and diet.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:15.490
Since some cannot afford to fast, the medical team taught them how to brag their teeth with salt.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:22.490
They also shared valuable insight on how to raise chickens, how to grow a jetabors on a small plot of land,

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:28.490
and even the importance of eating of a variety of simple, nutritious foods.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:34.490
Seeing these many expressions of love reassures our malagasy brothers and sisters,

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:43.490
but Jehovah is a god of sight, as stated at Genesis chapter 16, verse 13.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:50.490
Jehovah sees what his people are going through in his system of things,

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.490
and he uses his world-wide organization to support them.

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:00.490
Thank you brother Rahad Janirina for sharing those beautiful examples of brotherly love.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.490
Next, let's travel to Malawi to speak for a moment with brother Nurenda.

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:12.800
Brother Nurenda, how has the organization shown love to our brothers in Malawi?

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.800
Before 1983, the work was under ban in Malawi.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:24.800
Meetings, assemblies, and conventions were held in small groups at night.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:31.800
After the ban was lifted, we were able to arrange large day time gatherings.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:41.800
The branch funded the construction of simple structures to provide our brothers and sisters with shade from the hot sun

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.800
while attending these organic events.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:52.800
At the time, it was very easy and inexpensive to find local materials needed for these structures.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.800
But over the last few years, local suppliers have been doing good,

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.800
and the prices have gone up considerably.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:08.800
To solve this problem, the Malawi branch contacted the regional design construction department

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.800
at the South Africa branch.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:19.800
With approval from the governing body, these brothers worked together to design a mobile shared structure

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:26.800
that can be transported from one's eocratic event to another whenever it is needed.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:33.800
And last year, the brothers used the prototype of this structure at several locations in Malawi.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.800
We received many appreciative comments as a result.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.800
One sector of the year wrote,

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.800
brothers and sisters appreciated the shared covering

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.800
because they could concentrate during the program.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:54.800
And it was much cooler, more conducive to learning the whole of the real answer to our prayer.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:02.800
A popular word, more brothers and sisters were in their six during the program and paid better attention.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.800
We recently received approval from the governing body to expand the use of these structures.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:15.800
And we believe it will be a great blessing to our Malawi and brothers and sisters.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.800
Thank you, brother Nurenda.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.800
We're happy to see how Jehovah not only provides spiritual food,

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.800
but also makes it easier for us to consume it.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.800
We now focus on our brothers in the democratic republic of the Congo.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:36.800
Brother Alango, how do economic circumstances pose a challenge for our brothers there?

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:44.800
Brother Kurzan, the economic challenges are quite noticeable in connection with conventions and assemblies.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:52.800
The majority of our brothers have to travel on food with bicycles, motorcycles, even trucks to reach the convention site.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.800
They simply do not have enough money to arrange for other men of struggle.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:03.800
Once at the convention site, the visiting brothers stay in the homes with local brothers.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:14.800
In some cases, the branch has provided tents so that brothers who may already have people staying in the house can also have guests stay in the yard.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:25.800
But despite these logistical challenges, close to 800,000 brothers and sisters attended a regional convention in our branch territory.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:31.800
The brothers love convention very much and they always look forward to the next one.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.800
But hospitality is needed also when it's not convention season.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:42.800
Sometimes, political instability requires our brothers to relocate to safe safe.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:50.800
And when that happens, examples such as these sisters show the evidence of the unfailing love in our brotherhood.

00:07:53.050 --> 00:08:05.759
My husband has passed away and I take care of three children and nine grandchildren.

00:08:05.759 --> 00:08:08.759
I have a full house.

00:08:08.759 --> 00:08:19.620
It's challenging to provide even for our basic needs, a conflict broke out in the Kassai region.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:28.620
So brothers from that region came all the way on foot with no shoes and only the clothes on their back.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:37.620
When I saw how many they were and in what state it broke my heart.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:45.620
But I prayed to Jehovah so Jehovah gave me courage and boldness to take the brothers in.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:50.620
I decided to host three families in my house.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:54.620
I had no foam mattresses for those 18 people.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:09:01.620
All I could do was spread a piece of cloth on the cemented floor of the house for them to sleep on.

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:12.620
As the house has only one bedroom and a living room, I asked the brothers to sleep in the bedroom and the sisters with their children to sleep in the living room.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:19.620
My love for Jehovah and for my fellow Christians motivated me to take the brothers in.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:29.620
I received many blessings because the organisation Bethel sent food, flour, rice, oil and clothes.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:37.860
I was selling charcoal, packing it in smaller bags to get some money to feed all of us.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:53.129
Since Jehovah helped me in many ways, even with my small business and that we all lived together without any disputes, it was clear evidence of Jehovah support.

00:09:53.129 --> 00:09:58.129
Everything that has happened has touched my heart so deeply.

00:09:58.129 --> 00:10:04.129
I want to remain faithful to Jehovah God's organisation up to the end.

00:10:04.129 --> 00:10:10.129
I've gotten many friends among the brothers and sisters who sought refuge in my house.

00:10:10.129 --> 00:10:15.129
These friends helped me and tell me, keep your love intact to the end.

00:10:15.129 --> 00:10:24.399
I look forward to seeing the brothers and sisters who sought refuge here, who came empty handed.

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:32.399
In the new world, in paradise, they will have a house, eat to their heart's desire without any problems.

00:10:43.129 --> 00:10:53.129
One convention season and political appeal happened to coincide a ranging for accommodation for everyone could be challenging.

00:10:53.129 --> 00:10:56.129
This happened in 2017.

00:10:56.129 --> 00:11:04.129
The brothers near the convention site were already housing the brothers who have been displaced because of the fighting in the home region.

00:11:04.129 --> 00:11:09.129
Still, arrangements were made to accommodate those coming for the convention.

00:11:10.129 --> 00:11:19.129
For example, some brothers, they asked their non-witness neighbours to accommodate their guests, what they did with pleasure.

00:11:19.129 --> 00:11:27.129
And the visiting brothers made sure to share the kingdom message with the hosts and with many positive results.

00:11:27.129 --> 00:11:32.129
Very touching experiences, brother Longo. Thank you for your fine report.

00:11:32.129 --> 00:11:34.129
Thank you very much.

00:11:34.129 --> 00:11:36.129
Next, let's go to Asia.

00:11:36.129 --> 00:11:47.129
We have with us brother Yasushi Wakabayashi, who serves on the Taiwan branch committee and also brother Maurice Raj, who serves on the Myanmar branch committee.

00:11:47.129 --> 00:11:53.129
As you may know, Asia has recently been struck by several natural disasters.

00:11:53.129 --> 00:12:02.129
We want to start by asking brother Wakabayashi, what kinds of natural disasters have the brothers and sisters experienced in Taiwan?

00:12:02.129 --> 00:12:07.129
Well, we have experienced many typhoons and earthquakes.

00:12:07.129 --> 00:12:15.129
For example, an earthquake in 1999 killed some 2,400 people.

00:12:15.129 --> 00:12:30.129
Although large earthquakes have not been very common, we did have a magnitude 6.4 earthquake in 2016, an apartment building where a sister lived completely collapsed.

00:12:30.129 --> 00:12:34.129
Thankfully, she was not home when the earthquake hit.

00:12:34.129 --> 00:12:52.789
Another earthquake struck last year, but it was so encouraging to see how much our brothers and sisters in the midst of disaster value spiritual food.

00:12:52.789 --> 00:13:00.789
My wife and I are currently working as translators at the Amiz Remote Translation Office in Hualien.

00:13:01.789 --> 00:13:07.789
Amiz is an indigenous language spoken in the eastern part of Taiwan.

00:13:07.789 --> 00:13:11.789
The earthquake struck around midnight of February 6th.

00:13:11.789 --> 00:13:16.789
We heard very loud noises and people screaming outside.

00:13:16.789 --> 00:13:22.789
For a nature fell over and all my belongings were on the floor.

00:13:22.789 --> 00:13:28.789
Brother and sister Ruan ran into my room and gave me a pair of shoes to wear.

00:13:28.789 --> 00:13:33.789
I was stepping on broken glass as we fled outside.

00:13:33.789 --> 00:13:38.789
All we had were the clothes on our backs and a bag.

00:13:38.789 --> 00:13:45.830
Losing everything was hard on us emotionally.

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:57.830
However, the most important thing was not to focus on what I had lost, but had a resumed supply of spiritual food to continue to translate spiritual food for the Amiz people.

00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:04.830
We decided to move the translation office to a kingdom hall close by where it was safe.

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:14.830
The brothers and sisters all wanted the translation work to continue, so everyone cooperated to get things set up at the office.

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:23.830
One brother even asked me, do you need a car? We can lend you one so you can commute from your home to the office.

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:33.799
Before we could agree, he drove the car to where we were staying and gave us the keys.

00:14:33.799 --> 00:14:38.799
Many brothers and sisters sent things without asking us.

00:14:38.799 --> 00:14:47.799
They sent many clothes, meeting bags, ties, shoes from my wife, almost everything.

00:14:47.799 --> 00:14:52.799
We had something new to wear every day.

00:14:52.799 --> 00:14:57.799
This gave me a sense of urgency to resume our work as soon as possible.

00:14:57.799 --> 00:15:04.750
They translate our publications and not to set things back.

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:10.750
We were able to resume our work at the RTO just about a week after the earthquake.

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:17.750
The congregation arranged to witness to the victims at the shelter the same weekend after the earthquake.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:23.750
Some asked me, you are also a victim and yet you are comforting others.

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:32.480
Why? Because I believed when I comforted others, it brought me comfort too.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:38.480
The love and zeal the brothers displayed in such difficult times deeply touched our hearts.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:56.259
The brothers and sisters are always very quick to help when a natural disaster strikes.

00:15:56.259 --> 00:16:03.259
For example, during a recent typhoon, a tree fell on a sister's house.

00:16:03.259 --> 00:16:07.259
She later wrote to us about the events that followed.

00:16:07.259 --> 00:16:08.259
She wrote,

00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:14.259
As soon as you found out that my house was badly damaged by a tree,

00:16:14.259 --> 00:16:22.259
yes, immediately arrangements were made not only to visit us but also to fix and rebuild.

00:16:22.259 --> 00:16:30.259
It has been a great witness to all my unbelieving family members, relatives and neighbors.

00:16:30.259 --> 00:16:34.259
A great example of unfailing love.

00:16:34.259 --> 00:16:41.259
Still, while it is good not to presume upon the love of our brothers,

00:16:41.259 --> 00:16:46.259
sometimes the brothers and sisters can be reluctant to ask for help.

00:16:46.259 --> 00:16:53.259
For example, after a typhoon, an elder called the sister to ask if she was doing okay.

00:16:54.259 --> 00:16:55.259
She said,

00:16:55.259 --> 00:17:05.259
I'm fine, we can manage, but actually her roof had blown away, which to me would not really qualify as being okay.

00:17:05.259 --> 00:17:11.259
So, congregation elders have encouraged our brothers and sisters not to be shy,

00:17:11.259 --> 00:17:19.259
but to accept the help that they are offered by the organization as a reflection of Jehovah's love.

00:17:19.259 --> 00:17:21.259
That's such a good point.

00:17:21.259 --> 00:17:26.259
After all, we're living at the end of this system of things with all that it entails.

00:17:26.259 --> 00:17:30.259
And Jehovah asks us to trust in him.

00:17:30.259 --> 00:17:33.259
Thank you for that report, Brother Wakabayash.

00:17:33.259 --> 00:17:35.259
You're welcome.

00:17:35.259 --> 00:17:40.259
Next, let's speak with Brother Maurice Raj of the Myanmar Branch Committee.

00:17:40.259 --> 00:17:49.259
Brother Raj, what scriptural principles have guided our brothers in Myanmar to show love during natural disasters?

00:17:49.259 --> 00:17:56.259
Well, the example of the first century Christians has encouraged our brothers a lot.

00:17:56.259 --> 00:18:04.259
All those who become believers after Pentecost 33 C showed everything they had.

00:18:04.259 --> 00:18:10.259
In 2015, Myanmar was affected by a strong cyclone.

00:18:10.259 --> 00:18:13.259
Many of our brothers were affected.

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:21.259
As once a day called Haka, a massive landslide destroyed everything it had sparked,

00:18:21.259 --> 00:18:24.259
including the homes of our brothers.

00:18:24.259 --> 00:18:31.259
Since Haka is so remote, it's dependent on deliveries by trucks.

00:18:31.259 --> 00:18:35.259
However, the main road was destroyed.

00:18:35.259 --> 00:18:41.259
The city was isolated, prices skyrocketed,

00:18:41.259 --> 00:18:45.259
all of food supplies disabled in the market.

00:18:45.259 --> 00:18:47.259
What a serious situation.

00:18:47.259 --> 00:18:50.259
So what did the brothers take in the lead?

00:18:50.259 --> 00:18:59.259
The local elders assembled all the publics at a kingdom all located in a safe place.

00:18:59.259 --> 00:19:05.259
The elders asked everyone to bring all the food outside.

00:19:05.259 --> 00:19:12.259
The rain was still pouring and people were searching desperately for food.

00:19:12.259 --> 00:19:21.259
But inside the kingdom all, there was rice, oil, eggs, and vegetables.

00:19:21.259 --> 00:19:25.259
No one kept food just for themselves.

00:19:25.259 --> 00:19:30.259
Everyone shared until the first relief reached the city.

00:19:30.259 --> 00:19:34.259
All of our brothers felt jojava scared.

00:19:34.259 --> 00:19:44.259
And in the midst of this, the disaster relief committee made extra ordinary effort to reach the brothers.

00:19:44.259 --> 00:19:50.579
During one of our circuit visits, it started to rain heavily.

00:19:50.579 --> 00:19:54.579
According to the news on the radio, many of the roads in the area had collapsed

00:19:54.579 --> 00:19:59.579
and there were reports of landslides in Haka, the next congregation on our circuit.

00:19:59.579 --> 00:20:03.579
The distance from where I was to Haka was 65 miles.

00:20:03.579 --> 00:20:08.579
Despite the dangerous conditions, my wife and I decided to walk to Haka.

00:20:08.579 --> 00:20:12.579
I received a phone call from the branch.

00:20:12.579 --> 00:20:19.579
They requested the disaster relief committee to go and assist the brothers in need in the disaster areas.

00:20:19.579 --> 00:20:24.579
The committee prepared food and other supplies in a nearby city.

00:20:24.579 --> 00:20:28.579
The road was very muddy, so the trip took a long time.

00:20:28.579 --> 00:20:32.579
It took four days to reach Haka by foot.

00:20:32.579 --> 00:20:37.579
When we arrived in Haka, we discovered that some of the brothers and sisters lost their homes.

00:20:37.579 --> 00:20:44.579
So I met with the congregation elders and we arranged to make shepherding visits on these families.

00:20:44.579 --> 00:20:49.579
It brought me joy to see that they were comforted through jojava's word.

00:20:50.579 --> 00:20:57.579
Once we arrived in Haka, we arranged to distribute the food and other provisions that we had brought with us.

00:20:57.579 --> 00:21:02.579
After that, we started a journey together to help other congregations.

00:21:02.579 --> 00:21:05.579
It was a very difficult time for the brothers.

00:21:05.579 --> 00:21:13.579
One brother said, because we were running low on food, our family was planning to eat just one meal per day.

00:21:13.579 --> 00:21:18.579
But now, with the relief committee's help, we can eat all three meals.

00:21:19.579 --> 00:21:29.019
The brothers were so happy and were really thankful to jojava and his organization for their loving support.

00:21:29.019 --> 00:21:35.019
The trip was quite rough, but we felt that jojava supported us in wonderful ways.

00:21:35.019 --> 00:21:39.019
In some places, the roads were very bad.

00:21:39.019 --> 00:21:43.019
Sometimes, we had to cling to the edge of a cliff.

00:21:43.019 --> 00:21:48.019
We had to climb up very steep mountains and then climb down steep mountains.

00:21:48.019 --> 00:21:52.019
We even had to cross streams with strong currents.

00:21:52.019 --> 00:21:56.019
I knew that I couldn't give up, so I kept saying to myself,

00:21:56.019 --> 00:22:01.019
this is for God's kingdom, this is for God's kingdom, keep walking.

00:22:01.019 --> 00:22:04.019
That helped me to continue on my journey.

00:22:04.019 --> 00:22:12.019
To provide the congregations with the supplies, we walked 120 miles over four days.

00:22:12.019 --> 00:22:21.019
God used us to show to His people that He never abandons them and that He really cares about them.

00:22:21.019 --> 00:22:25.019
Knowing this brings such joy to our hearts.

00:22:25.019 --> 00:22:34.019
It was such a wonderful privilege for me to be involved in this relief work with jojava in behalf of our brothers and sisters.

00:22:34.019 --> 00:22:53.440
As a circuit to over say a brother, laugh-free mention,

00:22:53.440 --> 00:23:04.440
it was meditating on how jojava acted as a loving shepherd through the disaster relief committee that moved him to complete history.

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:12.440
Our acts of love can likewise become answered to our fellow believers' prayers.

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:18.440
Well, thank you for sharing that excellent example of showing unfailing love for our brothers.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.440
Thank you, brother Raj. Thank you, brother.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:23.440
Next, we visit Europe.

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:30.440
Brother Jason Ali serves on the Albania Branch Committee and Brother Lars Kasom on the Scandinavia Branch Committee.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:33.440
First, let's speak with brother Ali.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:39.440
The Albania branch oversees the work in Kosovo where a preaching campaign was recently arranged.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:45.440
Brother Ali, why was there a need for a preaching campaign in Kosovo?

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:55.440
The publisher to population ratio in Kosovo is the largest in all Europe, with one publisher to more than 8,700 inhabitants.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:24:03.440
This means that quite a number of cities and villages are seldom preached in, and many others have never received a witness.

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:11.440
When this preaching campaign started, almost one million of Kosovo's population had never heard the truth.

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:26.440
While many people in this territory have a religious outlook and have heard of the Bible and about Jesus Christ, many often connect religion with some of the atrocities that were committed in recent political conflicts in the region.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:36.440
Numerous families have been personally affected by the war of the 1990s in Kosovo, and in many cases they have lost loved ones in death.

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:43.440
So, it truly was an expression of love by the brothers and sisters who answered the call for help with this campaign.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:57.720
When we heard about the campaign, we thought about how wonderful it would be, if at least 200 volunteers would come.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:07.720
We were thrilled but also really nervous when we found out that over 600 volunteers were going to come.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:15.720
As soon as we heard about the campaign being organized in Kosovo, we were very excited and really wanted to take part in it.

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:20.720
Our limiting income would mean we would have to calculate the cost carefully.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:29.720
Also, because I lost my sight, the adjustment to a new environment preaching in villages obviously would not be easy for me.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:42.609
I was offered a scholarship from a university in Tirana but my mind was made up and my goal was to take part in this campaign and to give my best to Jehovah.

00:25:42.609 --> 00:25:47.609
Since I serve a better, I used my vacation days to come here for the campaign.

00:25:47.609 --> 00:26:10.319
This campaign has been an answer to my prayers.

00:26:10.319 --> 00:26:19.779
It was like Jehovah was saying, keep trying. You have brothers and sisters who are supporting you.

00:26:19.779 --> 00:26:29.779
I have worked with brothers and sisters from all over the world on this campaign and the sacrifices they have made to come here have been a real source of encouragement to me.

00:26:29.779 --> 00:26:38.779
I understood how much appreciation the volunteers were showing for the opportunity from Jehovah to support the campaign. I was deeply touched.

00:26:38.779 --> 00:26:44.779
If I could use all the words in the world to describe the joy this campaign gave me, they wouldn't be enough.

00:26:44.779 --> 00:26:52.779
Now I have seen with my own eyes my worldwide family and I feel in my heart the love and care that they have for us.

00:26:52.779 --> 00:27:11.660
As you heard, the campaign had a profound effect on the local publishers but it also had an impact on the field.

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:18.660
For example, one day a group of local publishers from different countries were having lunch in a local restaurant.

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:25.660
They noticed that a group of policemen that were having lunch in the same restaurant were often looking over at them.

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:30.660
So two brothers decided to approach them and started a conversation with them.

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:36.660
One of the officers said that he had seen the publishers in the city and you all of them very well.

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:46.660
Then he added, you are doing a very fine work. If everyone did the same work as you, there would be no more need for a police force.

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:55.660
This campaign resulted not only in the formation of new groups and pre-groups in some areas but also motivated the local publishers.

00:27:55.660 --> 00:28:03.660
It's amazing to see how initiatives like this campaign can be an expression of both brotherly and neighborly love.

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:05.660
Thank you brother Ali.

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:09.660
Next we turn to brother Lars Kassom in Scandinavia.

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:14.660
The Scandinavia branch office oversees among other places the work in Sweden.

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:19.660
How have recent world events shaped the preaching efforts in Sweden?

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:30.660
In Sweden, meeting refugees in the ministry has been common for many years and we have had foreign language congregations for decades.

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:38.660
However, in 2015 over 160,000 refugees arrived in Sweden.

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:49.660
So over a period of two years the service department approved forming 45 new foreign language groups and pre-groups in Sweden.

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:57.660
So today we have over 90 plus a number of foreign language congregations.

00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:05.660
Even in small congregations, the brothers have worked very hard to invite refugees to the meetings.

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:10.660
This has often resulted in kingdom halls packed to capacity.

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:19.079
Thousands of refugees come to Sweden every year.

00:29:19.079 --> 00:29:29.650
Some of these are sent into different refugee camps around young shipping.

00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:36.599
I came from Burundi as a refugee because of the war.

00:29:36.599 --> 00:29:41.599
I came to Sweden when I was 17. I came alone.

00:29:41.599 --> 00:29:45.599
When you come as a refugee, you are a stranger.

00:29:45.599 --> 00:29:51.599
You miss your family. You miss your friends. You miss everything.

00:29:51.599 --> 00:29:55.599
They need hope. They need the truth.

00:29:55.599 --> 00:29:59.599
And Jehovah has given us the privilege to give this to them.

00:29:59.599 --> 00:30:11.759
Many of these camps were in isolated areas.

00:30:11.759 --> 00:30:22.579
Sometimes when you visited them there could be three or four different nationalities in the same room.

00:30:22.579 --> 00:30:29.970
Some of the friends also learned a few different greetings.

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:46.529
Before setting off, we downloaded videos in up to 30 languages.

00:30:46.529 --> 00:30:53.529
Sometimes we connected interested ones with brothers who spoke their language through video calls.

00:30:53.529 --> 00:31:04.549
When we did not receive permissions to preach at the camp, we had to find other methods.

00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:12.980
We tried to invite people to a meeting in Swahili and more than 50 people came.

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:20.740
We had to borrow several child seats and ask many of the friends to help.

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:27.740
I feel that Jehovah has helped me to become more open-minded, much more patient and empathetic.

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:31.740
They were long days and sometimes you were tired in the evening.

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:36.740
But when you looked out and saw your brothers and sisters making the same sacrifice,

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:39.740
that motivated you to continue.

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:52.700
When you saw the way they accepted the truth, how it formed and transformed them, it was worth all the effort.

00:31:52.700 --> 00:32:04.609
Although many of us from Sweden are known as somewhat reserved,

00:32:04.609 --> 00:32:12.609
but when we meet a person who has lost everything, everything, even his family and friends,

00:32:12.609 --> 00:32:16.609
it really touches our heart.

00:32:17.609 --> 00:32:24.609
Today, our territory reminds us of Jesus' words at John 435.

00:32:24.609 --> 00:32:29.609
Lift up your eyes and view the fields that they are white for harvesting.

00:32:29.609 --> 00:32:36.109
While Sweden is one of the most secular lands in the world,

00:32:36.109 --> 00:32:43.109
with the influx of refugees, we now have territories filled with God-fearing people.

00:32:43.109 --> 00:32:47.109
These people are very often disappointed in their religion.

00:32:47.109 --> 00:32:53.109
So we are now happy to help them by offering them a solid hope for the future

00:32:53.109 --> 00:32:56.109
and give them a meeting in life.

00:32:56.109 --> 00:33:01.109
Of course, it takes an effort to study the Bible with someone in another language.

00:33:01.109 --> 00:33:08.109
But to be used by Jehovah in this special way brings us even closer to Him.

00:33:08.109 --> 00:33:14.109
So we are very grateful to Jehovah for this opportunity we have now

00:33:14.109 --> 00:33:17.109
to help refugees in Sweden.

00:33:17.109 --> 00:33:23.109
We appreciate the brothers and sisters in Sweden for setting a good example of neighborly love.

00:33:23.109 --> 00:33:26.109
Thank you for that report, Brother Cassalm.

00:33:26.109 --> 00:33:31.109
We've now come to North America, and we'll be talking with Brother Anthony Griffin,

00:33:31.109 --> 00:33:34.109
who serves on the United States Branch Committee.

00:33:34.109 --> 00:33:38.109
And we'll continue focusing on neighborly love.

00:33:38.109 --> 00:33:42.109
Brother Griffin, you mentioned to me earlier that you've seen a pattern.

00:33:42.109 --> 00:33:46.109
A pattern of what it takes to show personal interest.

00:33:46.109 --> 00:33:48.109
Can you tell us a bit more about that?

00:33:48.109 --> 00:33:49.109
Absolutely.

00:33:49.109 --> 00:33:54.109
When you talk to brothers and sisters who have progressive Bible studies

00:33:54.109 --> 00:33:58.109
and who have successfully aided new ones to serve Jehovah,

00:33:58.109 --> 00:34:02.109
what you'll notice is patterns begin to emerge.

00:34:02.109 --> 00:34:07.109
One of the patterns is that they prepare before they go out into the service.

00:34:07.109 --> 00:34:09.110
How does that help?

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:13.110
When you're prepared, you're more relaxed, and thus you're more friendly

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:16.110
when you present the good news at the door.

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:23.110
Another pattern is that effective Bible teachers, they think,

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:30.110
they pray, and they act on the personal needs and concerns of Bible students.

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:36.110
Whether those needs are physical or emotional or spiritual.

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:43.110
It's kind of what Remind you of what Paul said in 1 Corinthians 9 and verse 22.

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:51.110
He said that he became all things to people of all sorts

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:56.110
that he might by all possible means save some.

00:34:56.110 --> 00:35:03.110
So this means that inside every successful Bible teacher

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:08.110
is a heart that is filled with love for people.

00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:11.110
And it's this love, this outstretching love

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:14.110
that has motivated some to learn a new language,

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:17.110
some have moved to a foreign language congregation

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:21.110
in order to help and assist more to learn about Jehovah.

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:27.110
As an example of this, I'd like to introduce you to sister Sally Giltainen.

00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:31.110
Sister Giltainen did not allow anything

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:34.110
to stop her from showing neighborly love.

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:43.079
Just prior to my baptism, unfortunately, I became critically ill.

00:35:43.079 --> 00:35:46.079
I was eventually told I had two hours to live.

00:35:46.079 --> 00:35:49.079
The doctors insisted that I have a blood transfusion,

00:35:49.079 --> 00:35:50.079
and I took my stand.

00:35:50.079 --> 00:35:53.079
There was no question that I was willing to die for Jehovah.

00:35:53.079 --> 00:35:57.079
But the question to me was, was I willing to live for him?

00:35:57.079 --> 00:36:02.079
And I became all the more determined to use my life to serve Jehovah.

00:36:02.079 --> 00:36:05.079
So obviously I lived.

00:36:05.079 --> 00:36:10.079
It motivated me to really be focused on the ministry.

00:36:10.079 --> 00:36:13.079
I began regular pioneering when I was 17.

00:36:13.079 --> 00:36:16.079
It's been a privilege to study with people

00:36:16.079 --> 00:36:20.079
who were Baptist and Catholics and Methodist Episcopalians,

00:36:20.079 --> 00:36:23.079
some were atheists, some were rich, some were poor.

00:36:23.079 --> 00:36:27.079
There were five parents that came with their children,

00:36:27.079 --> 00:36:29.079
and there were 13 children.

00:36:29.079 --> 00:36:32.079
I was in such a supportive congregation,

00:36:32.079 --> 00:36:36.079
and there were so many young pioneers who had the energy.

00:36:36.079 --> 00:36:39.079
Those couples were so important to me.

00:36:39.079 --> 00:36:41.079
When my husband and I got married,

00:36:41.079 --> 00:36:45.079
we were in a rural congregation in Virginia.

00:36:45.079 --> 00:36:49.079
Eventually we wound up in the Spanish territory,

00:36:49.079 --> 00:36:56.079
so many migrant workers that I just wanted to be able to talk to them.

00:36:56.079 --> 00:36:59.079
It was a challenge because I didn't speak Spanish.

00:36:59.079 --> 00:37:01.079
Never let that stop me.

00:37:01.079 --> 00:37:04.079
I learned enough to get my foot in the door.

00:37:04.079 --> 00:37:09.079
While I didn't speak Spanish, I spoke the language of love.

00:37:09.079 --> 00:37:13.079
Jehovah's love, and that's what they were relating to.

00:37:13.079 --> 00:37:16.079
And I would work so hard to prepare for Bible studies.

00:37:16.079 --> 00:37:21.079
The goal was not just to teach doctrinal truth,

00:37:21.079 --> 00:37:23.079
but to teach them to know Jehovah.

00:37:23.079 --> 00:37:27.079
I would take some Bible students to visit other Bible students,

00:37:27.079 --> 00:37:29.079
so they could encourage one another.

00:37:29.079 --> 00:37:33.079
Eventually the brothers determined that they could hold a meeting.

00:37:33.079 --> 00:37:36.079
We thought 20 or 25 would come.

00:37:36.079 --> 00:37:40.079
82 people came to the first Spanish meeting.

00:37:40.079 --> 00:37:46.079
It was such a joyful day to watch them associate with each other.

00:37:46.079 --> 00:37:50.079
It was a family, and it continues to be to this day.

00:37:51.079 --> 00:37:54.079
For 35 years, David and I have driven separately to the meetings.

00:37:54.079 --> 00:37:58.079
We generally take two different cars to pick people up.

00:37:58.079 --> 00:38:01.079
I usually have a car full of people that I'm bringing.

00:38:01.079 --> 00:38:04.079
He will often have people he's picking up.

00:38:04.079 --> 00:38:08.079
If I'm going to teach people to know Jehovah and to love him,

00:38:08.079 --> 00:38:11.079
it began with me.

00:38:11.079 --> 00:38:16.079
So if my heart is filled with love for Jehovah and for people,

00:38:16.079 --> 00:38:18.079
hopefully they would show.

00:38:18.079 --> 00:38:21.079
Obviously you try really hard to teach the truth.

00:38:21.079 --> 00:38:27.079
I think that if anything, it's been the language of love.

00:38:27.079 --> 00:38:31.079
I've wanted so much for them to feel that love that Jehovah showed me.

00:38:31.079 --> 00:38:43.179
So showing personal interest by applying Bible principles,

00:38:43.179 --> 00:38:45.179
it really does work.

00:38:45.179 --> 00:38:49.179
And this can be demonstrated in many different ways.

00:38:49.179 --> 00:38:52.179
For example, in Los Angeles, California,

00:38:52.179 --> 00:38:55.179
there was a brother who was in a coffee shop.

00:38:55.179 --> 00:38:58.179
And he noticed a man who was reading a newspaper.

00:38:58.179 --> 00:39:00.179
So he approached the man.

00:39:00.179 --> 00:39:02.179
And he simply asked him,

00:39:02.179 --> 00:39:05.179
is there any good news in there today?

00:39:05.179 --> 00:39:08.179
So that led to a conversation.

00:39:08.179 --> 00:39:11.179
And the man brought up something that was concerned him.

00:39:11.179 --> 00:39:14.179
He was concerned about his young daughter.

00:39:14.179 --> 00:39:16.179
So the brother asked him,

00:39:16.179 --> 00:39:19.179
can I show you something on the website that might assist you

00:39:19.179 --> 00:39:21.179
in helping your daughter?

00:39:21.179 --> 00:39:24.179
So he showed him one of the Caleb and Sophia videos.

00:39:25.179 --> 00:39:27.179
Then after further discussion,

00:39:27.179 --> 00:39:30.179
the man wanted to know where the kingdom hall was.

00:39:30.179 --> 00:39:33.179
So the brother took him right back to the website,

00:39:33.179 --> 00:39:36.179
showed him the address of the local kingdom hall.

00:39:36.179 --> 00:39:39.179
What was the result of all of this?

00:39:39.179 --> 00:39:43.179
That man who was reading the newspaper at the coffee shop,

00:39:43.179 --> 00:39:45.179
he's now one of our brothers.

00:39:45.179 --> 00:39:49.179
And his daughter, she's making wonderful progress in the truth.

00:39:49.179 --> 00:39:51.179
Well, thank you, brother Griffin,

00:39:51.179 --> 00:39:53.179
for sharing those beautiful experiences

00:39:53.179 --> 00:39:57.179
about showing personal interest.

00:39:57.179 --> 00:40:00.179
Let's not talk for a moment about how our brothers faithfully care

00:40:00.179 --> 00:40:02.179
for our places of worship,

00:40:02.179 --> 00:40:06.179
which essentially is an aspect of showing love for Jehovah

00:40:06.179 --> 00:40:09.179
and our fellow brothers and sisters.

00:40:09.179 --> 00:40:11.179
This takes us to Oceania,

00:40:11.179 --> 00:40:14.179
where we have brother Kagowali Biyama joining us

00:40:14.179 --> 00:40:17.179
from the Papua New Guinea Branch Committee,

00:40:17.179 --> 00:40:19.179
and brother Abraham Lincoln,

00:40:19.179 --> 00:40:22.179
who serves on the Micronesia Branch Committee.

00:40:22.179 --> 00:40:25.179
We turned first to brother Biyama.

00:40:25.179 --> 00:40:30.179
What need for places of worship currently exists in Papua New Guinea?

00:40:30.179 --> 00:40:35.179
Currently, we need to construct 22 new kingdom halls

00:40:35.179 --> 00:40:39.179
and renovate 26 existing halls.

00:40:39.179 --> 00:40:43.179
Because of the increase in interest shown in the field,

00:40:43.179 --> 00:40:46.179
most of our big congregations in our main towns

00:40:46.179 --> 00:40:49.179
have had to split.

00:40:49.179 --> 00:40:53.179
Attendances at those congregation weekend meetings

00:40:53.179 --> 00:40:56.179
is generally double the seating capacity

00:40:56.179 --> 00:40:59.179
of their existing kingdom hall.

00:40:59.179 --> 00:41:01.179
So when the new kingdom hall is built,

00:41:01.179 --> 00:41:04.179
the brothers and sisters do all they can

00:41:04.179 --> 00:41:06.179
to support the LDC brothers

00:41:06.179 --> 00:41:10.179
who have come from afar to assist that belief.

00:41:10.179 --> 00:41:24.949
Accomplish the construction work here in PNG.

00:41:24.949 --> 00:41:28.300
There are many challenges.

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:30.300
Sometimes there is no road,

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:33.300
so the brothers and sisters have to carry all the materials

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:38.539
to the site to build a kingdom hall.

00:41:38.539 --> 00:41:42.539
Sometimes it's hard to travel to other areas for work,

00:41:42.539 --> 00:41:47.539
because we live behind our family and our friends.

00:41:47.539 --> 00:41:50.880
When we work on a kingdom hall,

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:53.880
everyone in the congregation helps us.

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:57.880
They cook for us and support the work on the site.

00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:59.880
In one congregation,

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:02.880
they give everything they have to support the work.

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:09.500
They work up early in the morning,

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:11.500
work down the mountains,

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:13.500
bringing food with them.

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:16.500
It takes them three or four hours

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:21.059
to come into the construction site,

00:42:21.059 --> 00:42:29.340
and they cook food.

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:31.340
After the construction team meets,

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:35.340
they clean up and they walk back.

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:39.340
It takes them three to four hours again.

00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:44.340
So around nine, then they arrive home.

00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:47.340
Sometimes it's hard for them,

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:51.340
because they have their own family to support.

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:56.340
It's a huge sacrifice that they've given to come and support this work.

00:42:56.340 --> 00:43:00.340
At the same time, we get encouragement at the meetings

00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:03.340
and when we are out witnessing

00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:06.340
some given encouragement to help us doing this work.

00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:12.780
We go out on the weekends to swim and play.

00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:15.780
In that way, we meet a lot of brothers and sisters

00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:18.780
and they become as family to us.

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:24.030
When brothers and sisters gave everything to support us in the work,

00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:29.030
this encourages me to give my best to do this work.

00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:32.630
Construction is hard work,

00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:35.630
and there are many challenges.

00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:39.630
But you receive many wonderful blessings.

00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:42.630
You will learn to trust in Jehovah.

00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:56.650
And also, you will be happy doing this work.

00:43:56.650 --> 00:44:00.650
It's fascinating to see how the outgoing of love for Jehovah

00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:03.650
can be manifested in not only practical ways,

00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:05.650
such as by cooking food for our brothers,

00:44:05.650 --> 00:44:08.650
but also how it can motivate the brothers

00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:11.650
as a sign to the construction project.

00:44:11.650 --> 00:44:14.650
Yes, and the love we see is not limited

00:44:14.650 --> 00:44:17.650
to the construction of the building,

00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:21.650
but it extends to the upkeep of the hall as well.

00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:25.650
Many passes by have stood in front of the Kingdom Hall property

00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:30.650
to take pictures because of its well kept look.

00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:34.650
That really shows how our love can be a great shot of praise to Jehovah.

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:37.650
Thank you, Brother Biyama, for that good report.

00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:41.650
And while some places have a huge need for Kingdom halls,

00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:46.650
others require similar effort because of the remoteness of the location.

00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:51.650
Brother Lincoln, the island of Tonawas is part of your branch territory.

00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:56.650
How did your brothers there show how much they treasure their places of worship?

00:44:56.650 --> 00:45:01.650
The brothers take serious their responsibility to maintain their Kingdom Hall

00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:04.650
as was visible in a recent renovation project.

00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:08.650
With the assistance of local and international servants,

00:45:08.650 --> 00:45:13.650
this small congregation of 31 publishers were able to complete the project

00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:15.650
in only 11 weeks.

00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:22.050
Our island, Tonawas, is very beautiful,

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:29.280
but many people have no jobs.

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:33.280
Previously, the Kingdom Hall was very small.

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:37.280
Even though we endeavoured to clean inside and out,

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:40.280
there were many things that were in bad condition,

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:44.280
because there was no money, not enough.

00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:50.280
There was no longer suitable for a sizable group to worship Jehovah there.

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:55.280
We were very happy when we heard that Jehovah's organization

00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:59.280
would help us with the Kingdom Hall in Tonawas.

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:04.280
We are grateful for the way Jehovah's Love was clearly manifest,

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:09.849
and for the love of our brothers from distant lands.

00:46:09.849 --> 00:46:17.190
There were difficulties that we experienced when the materials arrived in Chuk from Guam.

00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:21.190
We received the materials, using a flatbed truck to take them to a barge

00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:26.190
to be transported from the capital Alain Reno to Tonawas.

00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:30.190
Upon reaching Tonawas, it was very difficult to unload,

00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:32.190
because there is no dock.

00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:36.190
We used a motorboat to carry the materials from the barge

00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:41.190
to the drop off point, so it could reach the job site.

00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:47.190
On our island, people do not view construction as being women's work,

00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:51.190
but with the help of the brothers who came from distant lands,

00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:55.190
they really helped the sisters to understand how to use the tools.

00:46:55.190 --> 00:47:01.079
Many villagers were kind of mocked them.

00:47:01.079 --> 00:47:05.079
Look at those Jehovah's Witnesses going to work.

00:47:05.079 --> 00:47:09.079
It's not supposed to be women's work,

00:47:09.079 --> 00:47:14.079
but our sisters ignored it, because of their deep love for Jehovah.

00:47:14.079 --> 00:47:19.079
They walked, singing your songs, or they would not hear others mocking them.

00:47:19.079 --> 00:47:25.349
Today, we are very thankful to our God, Jehovah,

00:47:25.349 --> 00:47:28.349
and to our brothers around the world.

00:47:28.349 --> 00:47:33.349
Because of their love and hard work on behalf of their new kingdom hall,

00:47:33.349 --> 00:47:43.820
it really is a beautiful building for Jehovah,

00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:49.820
and for people in Tonawas to see what love Jehovah's people have among them.

00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:54.820
As Hebrews chapter 6 verse 10 plainly tells us about Jehovah's promise,

00:47:54.820 --> 00:48:02.579
he will not forget the love and hard work his people performed on our behalf.

00:48:02.579 --> 00:48:07.579
Though we can see how deep the Pacific Ocean is that separates us,

00:48:07.579 --> 00:48:15.579
because of Jehovah's love for us, it feels as if we are very close together as a family.

00:48:15.579 --> 00:48:26.980
It took the action and efforts of many involved to complete this renovation project.

00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:32.980
Through this action, the brothers and sisters showed how much they value the kingdom halls,

00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:37.980
as places where we can go and give thanks to Jehovah in the great congregation,

00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:40.980
stated in Psalm 35 verse 18.

00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:45.980
A lot of love goes into building each kingdom hall, and you highlighted that well.

00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:47.980
Brother Lincoln, thank you very much.

00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:48.980
Thank you.

00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:53.980
We have one more continent to visit, and that's South America.

00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:58.980
There we have Brother Douglas Little, who serves on the Bolivia branch committee,

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:03.980
and we also have Brother Siraldo Malsmit, who's on the Brazil branch committee.

00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:10.980
The friends in South America said a great example of reaching out to the many indigenous peoples,

00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:13.980
so we'll be focusing on that for the next few minutes.

00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:20.980
Brother Little, what does the branch in Bolivia do to reach remote populations with the good news?

00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:29.980
Well, Brother Curzon, Bolivia has dozens of indigenous languages spread throughout the country.

00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:37.980
Some of these languages have over a million speakers and others only a few hundred speakers.

00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:44.980
So in Acts chapter 1 verse 8 speaks about witnessing to the most distant part of the earth,

00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:47.980
we feel that we need to do our part.

00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:53.980
One way that we reach out to these populations is through campaigns.

00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:59.980
Once we have established that an area or language has potential for growth,

00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:04.980
we look at how we can give that field more permanent support.

00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:12.980
For example, we encourage pioneers to take up the challenge of learning an indigenous language,

00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:19.980
and when pioneers from other countries express their interest in serving in Bolivia,

00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:27.980
we include a recommendation of an indigenous language group they could consider serving in.

00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:35.980
And to give you an idea of what it's like, we would like you to meet these two sisters who came here to serve.

00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:40.980
My parents were in the International Construction Work before we were born,

00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:43.980
and we didn't know it as we were growing up,

00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:48.980
but they were planning on someday moving to another country to pioneer.

00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:52.420
My name is Jessica.

00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:53.420
My name is Mariah.

00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:57.420
We're from the United States, and we're serving in Benny Bolivia.

00:50:57.420 --> 00:51:07.179
How do our doubts at first about moving to another country?

00:51:07.179 --> 00:51:13.179
When you're pioneering in this area, you're in the sun a lot.

00:51:13.179 --> 00:51:28.659
You're either walking or riding a motorcycle or sometimes a bicycle out in service.

00:51:28.659 --> 00:51:39.289
Also adapting to a new culture, a new culture, new ways of eating that are different than what we're used to.

00:51:39.289 --> 00:51:45.289
But once we got here and we started going out in service, we met the brothers and sisters,

00:51:45.289 --> 00:51:48.289
we fell in love with Bolivia.

00:51:48.289 --> 00:52:00.460
Once we were preaching by boat and we arrived to one indigenous community,

00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:06.460
and a man on a motorcycle came and he started picking everybody up and collecting them.

00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:10.460
And we were worried at first. We thought that he didn't want them to listen to us,

00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:12.460
and so he was taking them all away.

00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:17.460
But it turns out in the end that he was the son of the chief in there in that community,

00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:21.460
and he was gathering everyone together so that they could all listen to us.

00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:26.460
It's something that you would never get to really do back home.

00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:46.860
Moving here has helped us to see how Jehovah's Hand has been more directly in our life.

00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:51.860
We've gotten to be part of activities that maybe we've heard about in a year-book

00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:54.860
or maybe we hear about on the broadcasting.

00:52:54.860 --> 00:53:00.860
But getting to live those activities makes us feel very happy and closer to the organization as well.

00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:05.860
We get to see how Jehovah is moving the organization in the last days

00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:08.860
to reach as many people as possible.

00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:15.860
That really drove us a lot closer to him because we were forced to trust more in him than in ourselves.

00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:21.679
So put the car in motion and Jehovah will bless you.

00:53:21.679 --> 00:53:34.039
Jehovah has richly blessed all these efforts of our brothers and sisters

00:53:34.039 --> 00:53:37.039
to reach out to the indigenous populations.

00:53:38.039 --> 00:53:45.039
To give you another example, in 2016, a caravan of 11 four-wheel-drive vehicles

00:53:45.039 --> 00:53:52.039
with 62 brothers and sisters went to the remote Isoso region

00:53:52.039 --> 00:53:56.039
where the people speak Bolivian Guarani.

00:53:56.039 --> 00:54:00.039
They were able to bring with them the recently translated Teach Us book.

00:54:00.039 --> 00:54:05.039
And as the brothers and sisters went door to door in each small village,

00:54:05.039 --> 00:54:11.039
the villagers would walk by and tell them not to forget to visit their houses too.

00:54:11.039 --> 00:54:19.039
Some were so excited to receive the brothers that they did want to risk not being home when they came back.

00:54:19.039 --> 00:54:25.039
So they brought their chair to their neighbor's house where the brothers and sisters were already visiting

00:54:25.039 --> 00:54:29.039
and sat down to participate in the discussion.

00:54:29.039 --> 00:54:32.039
Thank you, brother little, for sharing that with us.

00:54:32.039 --> 00:54:37.039
And we wish Jehovah's continued blessing on the preaching work in Bolivia.

00:54:37.039 --> 00:54:41.039
We'll now travel to Brazil to speak with Brother Malesmith.

00:54:41.039 --> 00:54:47.039
As in Bolivia, the branch in Brazil has made concerted efforts to cover remote territories.

00:54:47.039 --> 00:54:50.039
Can you tell us a bit about that, Brother Malesmith?

00:54:50.039 --> 00:54:53.039
Of course, Brother Cursum.

00:54:53.039 --> 00:54:58.039
In Brazil, about 50 million people living isolated areas

00:54:58.039 --> 00:55:03.039
that is more than many countries in entire populations.

00:55:03.039 --> 00:55:13.039
So in September 2018, we began a preaching campaign in more than 2000 isolated areas in Brazil

00:55:13.039 --> 00:55:18.039
where the congregations have a hard time covering their territories.

00:55:18.039 --> 00:55:25.039
So far, more than 40,000 publishers have volunteered to support this campaign.

00:55:26.039 --> 00:55:34.039
Along with these efforts, we have assigned in numerous graduates of the school for Kindle Evangelizers

00:55:34.039 --> 00:55:38.039
to remote parties off the branch of the territory.

00:55:38.039 --> 00:55:42.039
Brother and the sisters on the radio won such a couple.

00:55:42.039 --> 00:55:47.039
When we graduated from the School for Kingdom Evangelizers, to have surprise,

00:55:47.039 --> 00:55:53.429
we were assigned to the Sacade Maui field.

00:55:53.429 --> 00:55:57.429
This is an indigenous language spoken in the Amazon rainforest.

00:55:57.429 --> 00:56:03.429
It was a challenge for us because the assignment was about 4,000 kilometers away from our home and our friends.

00:56:03.429 --> 00:56:08.480
My name is Alex, and this is my wife Rosanne.

00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:12.480
We've been serving in this language for about a year and a half.

00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:21.889
We wanted to put into practice right away everything we had learned.

00:56:21.889 --> 00:56:25.889
But how could we do that if we didn't know the language?

00:56:25.889 --> 00:56:28.889
All we heard was blah, blah, blah. I couldn't understand anything.

00:56:28.889 --> 00:56:32.889
We know a sister who's a native speaker, so we asked her for a lot of help.

00:56:32.889 --> 00:56:39.889
We wanted to be able to know enough to at least be able to preach and understand a little bit of the language.

00:56:39.889 --> 00:56:53.460
We noticed that the Sacade people would come into the city and then go home on a crowded boat.

00:56:53.460 --> 00:56:57.460
So we and some other sisters decided to go with them.

00:56:57.460 --> 00:57:01.460
We were a little nervous, but we didn't know where we were going to spend the night,

00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:07.130
or even if the people would allow us to stay in the village.

00:57:07.130 --> 00:57:12.130
But they were very loving and received us well, some even offered for us to stay in their houses.

00:57:17.929 --> 00:57:25.929
Since we didn't know the language very well, we decided to learn just one presentation to teach them Jehovah's name.

00:57:25.929 --> 00:57:28.929
We showed God's name at every door, some of them were really surprised.

00:57:28.929 --> 00:57:34.929
They had a Bible, they had God's name right there in their Bible, but they didn't know that Jehovah is God.

00:57:34.929 --> 00:57:38.929
It was exciting for us to see them learning Jehovah's name for the first time.

00:57:38.929 --> 00:57:52.219
Who would want to learn a language spoken in the rainforest by only 10,000 people?

00:57:52.219 --> 00:57:55.219
But we know that Jehovah loves all sorts of people.

00:57:55.219 --> 00:57:59.219
He wants even people who live in isolated places like the rainforest to know him.

00:57:59.219 --> 00:58:09.619
I've fallen in love with the people, the assignment and the language.

00:58:09.619 --> 00:58:11.619
It's a beautiful language.

00:58:11.619 --> 00:58:18.659
Even with all the sacrifices we've made materially, we've never lacked anything.

00:58:18.659 --> 00:58:23.659
And I think that going through the experience of living here has strengthened our confidence in Jehovah.

00:58:23.659 --> 00:58:26.659
It's helped us not to rely on our own strength.

00:58:26.659 --> 00:58:30.659
We've really seen how well Jehovah takes care of us.

00:58:30.659 --> 00:58:54.519
Others who have been assigned it to remote territories have expressed the similar sentiments.

00:58:54.519 --> 00:58:57.519
And it is so rewarding.

00:58:57.519 --> 00:59:08.519
On one occasion, a couple went to a very isolated indigenous region to distribute a new brochure in the Tikkun language.

00:59:08.519 --> 00:59:11.519
When they arrived, they began to preach.

00:59:11.519 --> 00:59:14.519
An indigenous couple began to cry.

00:59:14.519 --> 00:59:17.519
And they embraced the brothers.

00:59:17.519 --> 00:59:20.519
The pioneers were a little worried.

00:59:20.519 --> 00:59:29.519
The couple explained that the previous day, they had the priest to God beg for him to let them know him.

00:59:29.519 --> 00:59:31.519
They couldn't believe it.

00:59:31.519 --> 00:59:37.519
When the next day, the pioneers showed up explaining the Bible.

00:59:37.519 --> 00:59:43.519
Talking about the God, the end of offering publications in their own language.

00:59:43.519 --> 00:59:55.519
The pioneers feel that Jehovah is listening and caring for these rumble and sincere people, even in the most remote places.

00:59:55.519 --> 00:59:57.519
That's such a good point.

00:59:57.519 --> 01:00:04.519
The love we show is ultimately an extension of Jehovah's love for those with a spiritual need.

01:00:04.519 --> 01:00:07.519
Thank you for your report, Brother MailSmith.

01:00:07.519 --> 01:00:13.519
And that concludes our travels to visit our brothers and sisters around the globe.

01:00:13.519 --> 01:00:18.519
Do you remember the different examples of brotherly and neighborly love we've seen in the past hour?

01:00:18.519 --> 01:00:27.519
We saw how our brothers and sisters in Africa show love by helping each other to cope with difficult economic circumstances.

01:00:27.519 --> 01:00:33.519
When we visited Asia, we saw the love shown during times of natural disasters.

01:00:34.519 --> 01:00:39.519
In Europe, preaching campaigns were used to share the good news.

01:00:39.519 --> 01:00:46.519
We saw examples from North America of how personal interest can reach a humble person's heart.

01:00:46.519 --> 01:00:56.519
And a lot of love and effort was put into supporting construction, renovation, and upkeep of places of worship in Oceania.

01:00:56.519 --> 01:01:06.519
And finally in South America, we joined our brothers and sisters as they went out of their comfort zone to preach, to indigenous, and remote populations.

01:01:06.519 --> 01:01:17.519
In the first talk of this convention, the chairman promised that this symposium would make you feel proud to be part of our international brotherhood.

01:01:17.519 --> 01:01:20.519
We're confident these examples had that effect.

01:01:20.519 --> 01:01:24.519
Still, each one of us needs to ask himself.

01:01:25.519 --> 01:01:27.519
Am I doing my part?

01:01:27.519 --> 01:01:32.519
Do I show unfailing love toward my brothers and my neighbors?

01:01:32.519 --> 01:01:36.519
This is what Jehovah requires of us.

01:01:36.519 --> 01:01:50.519
Although our circumstances may differ, when we do our utmost to display love in daily life, we prove that we are taught by Jehovah, our father, whose love never fails.
