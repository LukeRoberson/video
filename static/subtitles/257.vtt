00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.410
I work in the printer on the job press.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.410
That involves small printing jobs.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.780
Bethel is a unique environment that you don't find anywhere else.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:25.480
You spend time with people who have the same way of thinking that you do.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.480
The same manner, the same way of treating people.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:36.479
The fact that I am working in a department that is involved with producing spiritual food.

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:43.479
Even if it is just caring that spiritual food, that's a great privilege.

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:49.479
In the upholstery shop, we upholster sofas, arm chairs, chairs for the dining hall,

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:52.479
and for offices and so forth.

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:56.479
Back home, I completed my apprenticeship as an interior decorator,

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:00.950
which included upholstery.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.950
It fills me with great happiness, finally to do something purposeful in my life,

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.950
not to set out on a worldly career, not to work for money,

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.950
but to work for Jehovah and for my brothers.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:21.950
When I thought of coming to Bethel, I thought about two main things,

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.950
my spirituality and some kind of skill that could be useful to the organization.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.950
I thought about what would be most useful, electronics appealed to me,

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.950
so that's why I started it.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.950
I did courses and worked in this area.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.950
I don't see any better way of using my skills.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.950
It's something that brings me pleasure.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.950
Even if I'm assigned to do another kind of work, I'm still working full-time for Jehovah,

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.950
but since my abilities are being used in this way, that's better still.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.950
Jehovah does not use the best.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.950
He uses those who are available.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:55.950
I'm available.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.950
My circumstances permit me to serve at Bethel,

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.950
a young person who is willing, who offers himself, will be used at Bethel.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.950
Jehovah will train him to do things the way he wants them done.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.949
If you place your position, it will be very useful for Jehovah.

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:16.949
Jehovah will train him to do his job, to do things as he wants.

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:19.949
There is room at Bethel to have a good time and to enjoy yourself.

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:23.949
You get to meet lots of interesting people, many of whom will be your age,

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:27.949
and so I've had lots of good times with friends I've made that I wouldn't have made

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:28.949
them to Bethel.

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:31.949
I don't think you have to be special to work at Bethel.

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:36.949
You have to be willing to do whatever you're asked and you have to want to serve Jehovah.

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:42.949
Between doors, a circular was here, asked me, Sven, have you ever thought about going to Bethel?

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:48.949
I stared at him quite a guess and said, Bethel, but I'm in full-time service.

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:50.949
What would I do at Bethel?

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:54.949
I'm already in a form of full-time service.

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:57.949
And he said, well, just think.

00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:01.949
You can serve Jehovah not only out here, but also inside at Bethel.

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:04.949
At that point, I began to think about it.

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:07.949
The result was that I attended a battle meeting at the district convention,

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:11.949
got a Bethel application, and handed it in.

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:14.949
I feel that I'm doing something that has lasting value.

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:17.949
I could also have used my skills in the world,

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:20.949
but it would have been like depositing money in a bank,

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:23.949
that you know will be robbed tomorrow.

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:26.949
That means that what you did would be gone.

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:29.949
At Bethel, when you go home in the evening,

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:32.949
it might not be that everything at work went great,

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:35.949
but the time that you worked was effectively used for Jehovah.

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:37.949
And that gives you a super feeling.

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:39.949
It's impossible to describe.
