00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:13.980
The theme I would like to address this morning is guard against materialism, and I invite you to take another look at our day text in Matthew chapter 6 and verse 24.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:24.980
Here, a couched in the sermon on the Mount Jesus addressed his disciples and the crowds with an all-inclusive truth. Notice how that verse begins.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.980
No one can slave for two masters.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:38.979
Are there any exceptions to that rule? According to Jesus, according to Jehovah God, no exceptions.

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:46.979
But who are the two competing and very different masters that Jesus was referring to?

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:53.979
The end of the verse answers where he refers to God and riches.

00:00:53.979 --> 00:01:02.979
Did you notice that riches is presented here in the Bible with a capital R to begin?

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:11.980
Now that's interesting when we notice Jesus' other references to riches in the New World translation, where the R is not capitalized.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:29.980
Lowercase riches. For example, when Jesus refers later to the deceptive power of riches that can choke the word lowercase R, or when he referred to unrighteous riches that we need to use wisely, lowercase R.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:44.980
So why here in Matthew chapter 6 and verse 24, and in the parallel account at Luke chapter 16 and verse 13, did the New World translation Bible committee choose to capitalize the R?

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.980
Well, the study edition of the New World translation helps us here.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:57.980
It tells us that Matthew chapter 6 and verse 24 that the Greek word used here is traditionally translated Maman.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.980
That could also be rendered as riches or money. And then the comment adds this gem.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:12.979
It says that in this verse, riches is personified as a master or a kind of false God.

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:32.979
Well, we've seen that to be true, haven't we? For generations, humans have tended to elevate riches, good old money, riches, lowercase M, lowercase R, and they've elevated it to be a God that has, as our commenters commented on, enslaved millions.

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:48.979
What was the teaching Jesus was highlighting for his followers? It's that we Christians cannot give God the exclusive devotion that he deserves, and at the same time be devoted to gathering up more material possessions.

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:56.979
That's a very strong warning. So that leads us to two questions that we could consider with the balance of our time this morning.

00:02:56.979 --> 00:03:08.979
What is materialism and how can you and I guard against falling into that snare of gathering up more riches and making this our God?

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:22.979
Miriam Webster's dictionary offers this definition of materialism. It's a preoccupation with or a tendency to seek after or stress material things rather than intellectual or spiritual things.

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:35.979
But I found a definition in the publications of the faithful slave that I think is even better for all of us. In the context of Jesus words, the 1978 yearbook on page 9 expressed it this way.

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:58.979
It has been said that materialism is anything that stands between a person and his worship of Jehovah. So it need not necessarily be an expensive automobile, an ostentatious home or a large bank account, it could be anything that absorbs a person's time and attention so that he neglects the worship due to Jehovah.

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:13.979
Well, that's the point, isn't it? That Jesus was trying to stress for his followers. Could materialism entrap any of us who have chosen to put Kingdom interest first and have made material sacrifices in order to do that?

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:25.980
Well, that question prompted me to think of a faithful servant of Jehovah outlined in the Bible book of Jeremiah, Barak. Open please to Jeremiah chapter 45.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:42.980
Now, as we think about the faithful servant, Jeremiah and his secretary, Barak, we can imagine that they made considerable sacrifices to serve the interests of Jehovah's people at that time.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:54.980
Barak had a special privilege of service as do most of us here today, but something distracted him. Notice please the reading in Jeremiah chapter 45 and verse 3.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:02.980
Here, Jehovah pinpointed what Barak had said, perhaps only in his heart, only in his own thoughts.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:14.980
Verse 3. You have said, woe to me for Jehovah has added grief to my pain. I am weary from groaning and I have found no resting place.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:28.980
Barak was tired. He'd been serving Jehovah faithfully, but his assignment was difficult, perhaps stressful. And it was going to be 18 more years until the foretold destruction would come.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:36.980
But was it his service to Jehovah that was really the problem? Notice what Jehovah identified as we read verse 5.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:45.980
But you are seeking great things for yourself. Stop seeking such things.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:55.980
Those great things could have been material things. It could have been that he was ensnared by materialism.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:13.980
If that was the case, Jehovah's warning to stop seeking such things was timely. Later on in that same verse Barak was reminded that his life, not his possessions, not his things, was going to be the spoil that Jehovah was going to provide at the upcoming destruction.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:24.980
Well, how can we guard against falling into the snare of materialism? Like Barak, we from time to time need to take a long hard look at our personal view of money and personal things.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:39.980
The September 2015 issue of the awake magazine posed some questions for self-examination. Here's just a few of them. Am I attracted to get rich quick schemes? Do I find it difficult to be generous with my money?

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:50.980
Does money make me feel important? Am I always thinking about money? Is my attitude toward money adversely affecting my health and family life?

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:59.980
You know, real life experiences among our brothers and sisters proves that we all need to be thinking seriously about this matter.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:08.980
Alex, one of our brothers got caught up in trading in the stock market, thinking he could soon quit his job and enter the pioneer service. He was well motivated.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:23.980
But he got caught in a vortex of studying offers and market reports. He used his savings and his money borrowed from brokers to buy stocks that the analysts had predicted would quickly rise in value.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:34.980
Do you know how the story plays out for Alex? Months passed. The stocks never rebounded. Alex lost his savings and ended up having to sell his home.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:43.980
What a painful consequence to being deceived by this cruel master money.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:58.980
Alex reflected on what took place and he said this. I caused my family great pain. I now know that anyone who puts his trust in Jehovah's in Satan's system will be profoundly disappointed.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:06.980
There was another experience of a sister valentine from Jamaica that caught my attention when I was researching this point.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:16.980
You may remember the article that was published in the January 1st 2006 issue of the watchtower bringing up eight children in Jehovah's ways was a challenge and a joy.

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:25.980
Our sister related experience that involved her view of material things. Now we keep in mind she was not well to do financially. Imagine a mother of eight.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:37.980
The husband has abandoned her. She's raising them to serve Jehovah. But does the fact that we may have a little financially speaking me that were immune to the trap of materialism.

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:43.980
In 1988, Hurricane Gilbert devastated the island. She wrote this.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:52.980
We left our home for a shelter and a safer place. During a lull in the storm my son and I left the refuge area to survey the wreckage that was once our home.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:09:02.980
While poking around in the debris, I spotted something I wanted to save. Suddenly winds were howling again. But I still held on to what I had salvaged.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:14.830
Her son spoke up. Mom, put down the television. Are you lots wife? Our sister commented that that comment from her son caught her.

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:21.830
Returned her to her senses. She dropped the rain soaked TV and they ran for safety.

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:32.830
Sister Valentin did a self examination. She thought about what took place at that moment. She says I recall how I risked my life for a TV.

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:40.830
But it warmed her heart that her son had the spiritual insight to provide her a warning at the right time.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:57.830
Well, it's a good lesson for all of us, isn't it? No matter what our economic situation may be, we need to view money as a skillful tool and use it for that purpose, but not allow it to rule or control us.

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:01.830
We do not want to stab ourselves all over with many pains.
