00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:07.389
Paul advised the Ephesians and Ephesians 4.26 and 27,

00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:11.390
let the sun not set with you in a provoked state,

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.390
neither allow place for the devil.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:19.390
Yes, some even have changed the congregation

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.390
that they attended because of nursing a garage and being offended.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.390
What can cause a garage to develop?

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.390
One may not have received certain privileges that one counted on.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:41.390
Or one feels hurt because of seemingly or actually having been reproofed unjustly or too severely.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.390
Some harbor a garage because they have been criticized,

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.390
especially if this happens repeatedly.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.390
We can help others not to harbor a garage by not saying things that hurt

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.390
and by not trying to pull the straw out of the other's eyes, so to say.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.390
So what if somebody offends us?

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.390
We are all occasionally guilty of a tactless or even unkind remark.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.390
And so we want to also forgive others.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.390
Don't we want others to forgive us, our unkind remarks?

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.390
There's nobody that does not sin with his tongue.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.390
Don't talk with others about your garage except with a trusted friend.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.390
Talking with others may cause a division in the congregation or family.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:36.640
Let's see what the Bible has to say in Proverbs chapter 17 verse 9.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.640
Whoever forgives a transgression seeks love.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.640
But the one who keeps harping on a matter separates close friends.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.640
Hold his spirit can help us to forgive.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.640
If you cannot forgive and forget, then talk it over with a person that hurt you.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.640
Holding a garage can lead to serious sin.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.639
With Bible examples like Cain held a garage against Abel leading to his murdering him.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:14.639
Joseph's brothers held a garage against him because of his dreams and because he was the favorite of his father.

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:18.639
Some of them even intended to kill Joseph.

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:23.639
In contrast, Joseph did not hold a garage against his brothers.

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:29.639
He saw nurse the murderous garage against Jacob because Jacob got the firstborn's blessing.

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:34.639
He saw even considered killing him after the death of his father.

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:42.639
Herodias was nursing a garage against John for exposing her adultery and this led to his murder.

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:45.639
But fortunately we have many fine examples in the Bible.

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:53.639
Job prayed in behalf of his three companions who had caused him so much grief instead of holding a garage.

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:55.639
He prayed for them.

00:02:55.639 --> 00:03:04.639
Jonathan did not hold a garage when he learned that David would inherit the kingdom, although David was about 30 years younger than him.

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:10.639
Peter did not hold a garage against Jesus who called him Satan or resistor.

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:19.639
Also after being rebuked by Paul even publicly, Peter continued to express love for Paul.

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:26.639
Martha was not nursing a garage against Jesus for his loving counsel related to preparing a meal.

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:33.639
John Mark did not hold a garage when Paul did not want him to go with him on a missionary tour.

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:38.639
He continued his active service traveling with Barnabas.

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:42.639
What about the silent treatment?

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.639
So-called silent treatment.

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:49.639
A definite obstacle to communication is the silent treatment truth.

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:54.639
And sometimes the victim uses this as a kind of punishment.

00:03:54.639 --> 00:04:06.639
However, watched out in 2006, September 15, page 23, paragraph 16 said,

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:18.639
quote, this is not always a matter of punishing one's partner, as it may result from frustration or discouragement.

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:22.639
End of quote could border even depression.

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:30.079
One may just be at the loss of words without holding a garage.

00:04:30.079 --> 00:04:34.079
Some may be very outspoken and defend others repeatedly.

00:04:34.079 --> 00:04:39.079
Proverbs 12, 18 says, thoughtless speeches like the stabs of a sword.

00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:43.079
Thoughtless speech is not legitimate communication.

00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:47.079
Communication should be carried on in a loving way.

00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:56.079
Even if somebody did not want to hurt another intentionally, thoughtless speech, exaggerations, and so on still hurt.

00:04:56.079 --> 00:05:03.079
If somebody stabs you with a literal sword unintentionally, does it not still hurt?

00:05:03.079 --> 00:05:11.079
Therefore, this spends with talking intense, intense expressions really cause offense.

00:05:11.079 --> 00:05:14.079
This makes sense, doesn't it?

00:05:14.079 --> 00:05:17.079
Intense talk is like a storm.

00:05:17.079 --> 00:05:20.079
Gentle talk like a pleasant breeze.

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:23.079
Intense talk is like a rock concert.

00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:26.079
Gentle talk like pleasant music.

00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:30.079
Intense talk is like an avalanche or a blizzard.

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:35.079
Gentle talk is like beautiful quiet snowfall.

00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:40.079
Intense talk is like pouring a bucket of water on a newly planted flower.

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:43.079
Gentle talk is like gentle rain.

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:48.079
So let's all be gentle men and gentle women.

00:05:48.079 --> 00:05:52.079
How something is said is very important.

00:05:52.079 --> 00:05:58.079
We can read that in Colossians 4 or 6 texts that's generally well known.

00:05:58.079 --> 00:06:10.079
4 or 6 says, let your words always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you will know how to shoot, you should answer to each one.

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:18.079
In order to be gracious in your tone of voice and word, choice.

00:06:18.079 --> 00:06:26.079
As recipient of unloving words, resist the urge to be sarcastic and keep your volume down.

00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:30.079
But as Watchtower said some time ago,

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:38.079
quote, even whispered words can be argumentative if they are irritating or demeaning.

00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:46.079
Avoid hurtful accusations such as, you don't care about me or you never listen.

00:06:46.079 --> 00:06:52.579
Some are argumentative by nature or because of the way they were brought up.

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:57.579
Blurting out one's views or feelings may be hurting.

00:06:57.579 --> 00:07:02.579
Yes, blurting leads to be hurting.

00:07:02.579 --> 00:07:12.579
Maryam Webster defines blurting, quote, to say something suddenly and without thinking about how people will react.

00:07:12.579 --> 00:07:19.930
Therefore, switch on the mind before you start operating the mouth.

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:24.930
If hurt, why not excuse yourself and walk away for a short while to cool down?

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:30.930
Go into another room or go for a walk until we've regained your composure.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.930
This is not the silent treatment.

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:41.930
This quote from the awake of 15th of December, page 4.

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.930
Don't let Grudge pull you into a sludge.

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:47.930
Grudge is also a robber.

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:50.930
It robs us of peace of mind.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:54.930
It's like rust that slowly corrodes the body of a car.

00:07:54.930 --> 00:08:01.930
The car's outside may appear beautiful, but under the paint there's a problem.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:08.930
Love keeps out resentment and grudge as a good roof keeps out rain.

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:10.930
And love never fails.

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:15.930
In fact, our love for Jehovah is tested by our love for our brothers.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:22.930
Here's a scary quote from the inside book, William II, page 1149.

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:30.930
An individual is condemned by God if he bears a grudge for real or fancied wrongs

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:33.929
down to himself or to someone else.

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:38.929
It's that serious. It means to be grieving the Holy Spirit.

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:42.929
Remember, we must forgive others.

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:49.929
That's what the Bible says in Leviticus chapter 19, verse 18.

00:08:50.929 --> 00:09:00.929
It says, this, you must not take vengeance nor hold a grudge against the sons of your people.

00:09:00.929 --> 00:09:02.929
But it doesn't end there.

00:09:02.929 --> 00:09:06.929
The second part of the verse is just as important.

00:09:06.929 --> 00:09:14.929
It continues and says, you must love your fellow as yourself.

00:09:14.929 --> 00:09:17.929
I am Jehovah.

00:09:17.929 --> 00:09:29.929
So we appreciate that love never fails and will overcome any feelings of harboring a grudge against somebody.
