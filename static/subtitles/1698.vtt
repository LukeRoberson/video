00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:08.220
I was born in Dolby Queensland on the youngest of five children and my mother and father

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.179
they owned their own Piggory so we lived on a little farm about 10 minutes out of town.

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:19.980
When I was eight years old my parents separated which came as a huge shop to me.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.500
It was devastating and the consequences just seemed to roll on for decades.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.620
I would go and start the farm with my father for school holidays but my dad here

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.820
abused alcohol and smoked cigarettes and used bad language.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.619
So by the time I was a teenager I was doing exactly the same thing.

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:47.179
In my later teens I was smoking marijuana every day and I was spending up to four nights

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:50.979
a week at pubs and clubs and parties.

00:00:50.979 --> 00:01:00.500
I was addicted to alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana and pornography and I had no power to stop.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:07.500
Obviously it was only a matter of time before that lifestyle affected my health.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.280
I lost my social skills and I became depressed.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.239
The turning point in my life came one afternoon when two of Jehovah's Witnesses knocked on

00:01:18.239 --> 00:01:20.239
my door.

00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:26.239
Because of feeling so lost and so unhappy I had started to search for answers and I'd

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:30.689
begun looking at new age teachings.

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.650
The timing felt too remarkable to be just coincidence.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.049
I really felt like God wanted me to take the book.

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:47.430
I never looked at new age teachings again I started to read the greatest man book instead.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:55.510
A major key for me to be able to make the necessary changes was to cut off bad association.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.469
I was baptized in March 1994.

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:04.390
When I finally took that step I felt like I'd started on the right path.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.789
I was so grateful that Jehovah had found me and that he'd drawn me.

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.789
I really fell in love with the thoughts of Psalm 8 verses 3 and 4.

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:21.590
Oh Jehovah, when I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.430
that you have prepared, what is mortal man that you keep him in mind and the son of

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.110
earthling man that you take care of him?

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.710
I felt so insignificant and yet Jehovah knew me.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:41.629
The hope of everlasting life also really touched my heart and so did Jehovah's forgiveness.

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:47.550
I felt so grateful that Jehovah could forgive me for all of my wrongdoing and that I could

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.430
have a fresh start.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:56.949
When we were invited to start circuit work I had serious doubts about my inadequacies.

00:02:56.949 --> 00:03:00.189
I was not fast at preparing talks.

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:06.469
For me, it always felt like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:11.870
But the very morning after receiving our assignment to go on the circuit work full time,

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:18.990
my Bible reading was Exodus chapters 3 and 4 where Moses cited his inadequacies to Jehovah

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.430
that he was not a fluent speaker.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.949
Well of course, Jehovah asked him, who is it that assigns a mouth?

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:33.150
It was like Jehovah was saying to me, don't worry, I will help you.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.229
To make the changes that I did in life, I'm just so grateful to Jehovah.

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:41.229
Before I learned the truth, I was lost.

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:44.150
I didn't know who I was.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.150
I was just a mess.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.550
I wanted to be a man and I didn't really even know how to do it.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.830
Jehovah has rebuilt me from the ground up.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.509
Jehovah has given me everything.
