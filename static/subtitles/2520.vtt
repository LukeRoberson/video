00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:11.359
Sophia, are you ready to go out and service?

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:16.769
What's in your bag?

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:19.769
Hmm, looks like you're missing something.

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:24.769
What do you need for service?

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:26.769
Very good!

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:28.769
You need your Bible for service.

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.770
Do you need anything else?

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.259
Kids, can you help Sophia?

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:41.259
Which one does she need for service?

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:46.460
That's right, kids.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.460
Sophia, one more thing.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.460
How will you remember the people we meet?

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.460
Very good!

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.460
Do you have a pencil?

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.460
Excellent, Sophia.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.460
I think you're all set.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.459
Kids, what do you think? Is she ready?

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:06.459
Yes!

00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:09.459
Okay, let's go practice what you're going to say.
