00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:06.750
Greetings and a hearty welcome to J.W. Broadcasting.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.750
Today, I'm joined by my co-host and friend, Don Gordon.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.750
Don, what do we have in store for this month's program?

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.750
We all want to look our best.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.750
But is it possible to care too much about our appearance?

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.750
Tony and Samantha will tell us what they learned.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.750
Many years ago, Janice found the comfort and courage she needed to cope with discouraging circumstances.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.750
We'll catch up with her in the next episode of the series. Where are they now?

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.750
And finally, we'll debut a new series that will bring Bible characters to life.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.750
Well, let's get started.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.750
This is the September 2023 edition of J.W. Broadcasting.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:24.569
This month, I'd like to talk to you on the subject, Jehovah loves you, despite appearances, are imperfections.

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:33.569
You likely notice there are two areas we'll discuss, our appearance and our imperfections.

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:37.569
Why address these two aspects?

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:52.569
It's because there's a percentage of Jehovah's faithful servants that wonder if Jehovah can really love them because of one of those two reasons or both.

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:54.569
Let's take appearances first.

00:01:54.569 --> 00:02:06.569
When you've gotten all cleaned up and are fully dressed each day and you're glassed of full length mirror, are you pleased with the way you look?

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:12.569
Would you like to change a few things, but you can't?

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:21.569
Some of us tend to compare ourselves to other imperfect humans and adopt the thinking of the masses.

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:35.569
Movies and television have blinded many to reality, making them feel that the beauty of the human body must look like the handsome and beautiful movie stars.

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:50.569
However, comparing ourselves to them can often be very disappointing, time consuming and even expensive.

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:56.569
If you go to great lengths to try to look more like another person.

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:03.569
It's true, some have been born with a physical impairment or disability.

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:13.569
This may be obvious to others, and some unkind people might have made comments or teased the person.

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:21.569
That can make a person feel self-conscious or even create a feeling of low self-esteem.

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:31.569
This can become slow and ingrained in one's thinking that he might begin to feel no one could love him.

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:41.569
And at times, that kind of erroneous thinking can even affect a person's view of Jehovah's love.

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:51.569
However, please be assured that Jehovah loves us despite our physical appearance.

00:03:51.569 --> 00:04:00.569
It's been said, beauty is only skin deep. It fades with time.

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.569
Just look at a picture of yourself when you were, let's say, 17.

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:15.569
And then look at one when you are in your 80s. You say, that's not me. Oh yes it is.

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:20.569
Humans are sometimes enamored by appearances.

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:31.980
We don't mean to do this, but we may get caught up in this trap, a faithful prophet of Jehovah fell into this type of reasoning.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.980
Do you remember when Jehovah told Samuel to anoint the next king of Israel?

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.980
At first Samuel, chapter 16, verse 3,

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:48.980
Jehovah told Samuel to go to Jesse in the Bethlehem and there he said,

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:59.740
you must anoint for me the one whom I designate to you. Do you have that in your mind?

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:08.740
Samuel, you must anoint the one whom I designate to you. What happened?

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:16.740
Samuel defaulted to the way human sometimes a few others or appearances.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:23.740
Let's read what happened. It's recorded at first Samuel chapter 16, verse 6.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.740
It reads,

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.740
as they came in and he saw Eliad, he said,

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:36.740
surely here before Jehovah stands his anointed one.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:44.740
Samuel didn't really know Eliad, but he was impressed with his appearance.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:55.110
He was tall and likely a good looking man. Read along with me on the screen, verse 7.

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:02.740
Jehovah's wave assessing our worth before him is very different.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.740
Verse 7 says,

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.740
But Jehovah said to Samuel,

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:17.740
do not pay attention to his appearance and how tall he is for I have rejected him.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.740
Now note this,

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.740
for the way man sees is not the way God sees,

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.740
because mere man sees what appears to the eyes.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.740
But Jehovah sees into the heart.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.740
Jehovah's view of beauty is different from ours.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.740
Close your little eyes for a minute and see what your mind's eye.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.990
A beautiful bird.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.990
Now open your eyes.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.990
Which bird did you see?

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.990
Was it an indigo bunting?

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:53.990
A cardinal?

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.990
Or a Baltimore Oreo?

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.990
Those are beautiful birds.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:09.990
But does Jehovah prefer one bird over another just because of his beauty or appearance?

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:17.990
What bird did Jesus choose in teaching his disciples a valuable lesson about Jehovah?

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.990
He used a sparrow.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:27.990
A plain somewhat drab looking little bird of small monetary value.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:33.990
Follow along on screen as I read Matthew 10 verses 29 and 31.

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:37.990
Two sparrow sell for a coin of small value.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.990
Do they not?

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:45.990
Yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your father's knowledge.

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:50.990
But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:52.990
So have no fear.

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:57.990
You are worth more than many sparrows.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:05.990
Jesus represented Jehovah's view of all those who have dedicated themselves to Him

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.990
and are trying to remain faithful.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:11.990
Think about it.

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:20.990
Jehovah likely notices when an indigo bunting, a cardinal, or a Baltimore Oreo falls to the ground.

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:29.990
But Jesus made a significant point when He chose to use a sparrow in His illustration.

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:35.990
Jehovah is not impressed with the beauty of one's physical appearance.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:44.990
He loves us as much as He loves any of His faithful servants, despite our appearance.

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:49.990
In fact, Jesus went a step further and said,

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:55.990
You are worth more than many sparrows.

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:57.990
You're not just a bird.

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:04.990
You are a precious human who has come to know and love Jehovah.

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:09.990
He loves you not because of your appearance.

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:20.990
Being handsome, drab looking, short, heavy, skinny, bold, beautiful, less than beautiful,

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:25.990
having warts or a limp or missing limbs.

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:32.990
Being cross-eyed or having a different skin color or shape of your eyes.

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:33.990
No.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:39.990
Jehovah loves you because of who you are at heart.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:45.659
Do you remember what Jehovah told Samuel?

00:09:45.659 --> 00:09:55.059
Man sees what appears to the eyes, but Jehovah sees into the heart.

00:09:55.059 --> 00:10:05.059
Yes, Jehovah looks at you and sees the secret person of the heart that came to love your God, the universal sovereign.

00:10:06.059 --> 00:10:11.059
You cannot take that aspect away from the attention of Jehovah.

00:10:11.059 --> 00:10:21.059
If you love Him like Jesus indicates you can, He loves you, despite any external appearances.

00:10:21.059 --> 00:10:27.539
You likely remember Jesus said at Mark 12-30.

00:10:27.539 --> 00:10:35.539
You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul

00:10:35.539 --> 00:10:40.539
and with your whole mind and with your whole strength.

00:10:40.539 --> 00:10:42.539
That's it.

00:10:42.539 --> 00:10:48.539
Jesus did not add and your good looks.

00:10:48.539 --> 00:10:50.539
No.

00:10:50.539 --> 00:10:59.850
Your appearance is not a factor in your love for Jehovah or his love for you.

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:03.850
Maybe you say, I am crippled in both feet.

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:05.850
I have a trouble walking.

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:09.850
I feel dead inside.

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:13.850
You are not the first servant of Jehovah to feel that way.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:16.850
The Phoebe chef evidently felt that way.

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:20.850
He too was crippled in both feet.

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:30.850
King David had just honored him by promising to give him property and the privilege of eating his meals with the king.

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:37.850
Notice how the Phoebe chef felt about himself at 2 Samuel chapter 9 verse 8.

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:45.850
What is your servant that you have turned your attention to a dead dog like me?

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:49.850
He did not have a high opinion of himself.

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:54.850
It sounds like low self-esteem, doesn't it?

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:58.850
If you have a physical impairment or a defect,

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:05.850
you are not dead but very much alive in Jehovah's eye.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:10.850
Listen to what Jehovah tells you at Melachi chapter 4 verse 2.

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:19.850
But on you who honor my name, the son of righteousness will shine with healing in its rays

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:24.850
and you will skip about like fattened calves.

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:34.850
Do what you can with what you have to work with knowing Jehovah loves you and ultimately will correct any physical problem.

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:42.850
You will then be able to live for all eternity without any concerns about your appearance.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:51.100
Now let's talk about Jehovah's love for us despite our imperfections.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:55.100
If you're a human, you're imperfect.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:58.100
Sorry, that's just the way it is.

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:03.100
Adam passed imperfection onto all of us.

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:08.100
Being imperfect, we will all make mistakes.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.100
We all do without exception.

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:17.570
You'll be embarrassed at your imperfect reaction at times.

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:19.570
But it happens.

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:22.570
Jehovah knows our condition.

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:26.570
He knows what Adam handed down to us.

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:32.570
Yet he still loves us despite imperfection.

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:35.570
It really is not our fault.

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:41.299
How can Jehovah still love us when we make mistakes?

00:13:41.299 --> 00:13:44.299
Use poor judgment on occasion.

00:13:44.299 --> 00:13:51.299
And at times fall into serious sin, though we're sorry and repentant that way.

00:13:51.299 --> 00:13:57.610
It's on the basis of Jesus' ransom sacrifice.

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:03.610
Let's read Mark 10, verse 45, from the screen.

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:16.610
For even the Son of Man came not to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his life as a ransom in exchange for many.

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:20.610
Jesus absorbs our mistakes.

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:31.610
This is possible because he gave his perfect human life for us in exchange for what Adam lost and passed on to us.

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:36.610
And look with me at 1 Corinthians chapter 15, verse 22.

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:40.610
For just as an Adam, all are dying.

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:45.610
So also in the Christ, all will be made alive.

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:47.610
That's beautiful.

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:52.610
Jehovah does not hold our imperfections against us.

00:14:52.610 --> 00:15:06.269
As long as we acknowledge our imperfections and feel remorse in our repentant, he loves us despite the issue.

00:15:06.269 --> 00:15:22.269
Revelation chapter 21, verses 1 through 5, says that in time humans will experience the removal of tears, morning, outcry, pain, and even death.

00:15:22.269 --> 00:15:28.269
All of these painful situations are based on the sin of Adam.

00:15:28.269 --> 00:15:33.269
They will then be gone.

00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:45.269
For obedient humans, this means a return to the perfect state enjoyed by man at the beginning of human history in the Garden of Eden.

00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:57.269
So the humans will be able to enjoy not only perfection as to faith and love, but perfection as to sinlessness.

00:15:57.269 --> 00:16:06.269
At that time, they'll measure up fully and fallously to God's righteous standards for humans.

00:16:06.269 --> 00:16:10.269
Can you imagine that glorious time?

00:16:10.269 --> 00:16:20.269
Of course, perfection at that time does not mean an end to variety, as some persons often assume.

00:16:20.269 --> 00:16:29.269
The animal kingdom, which is the product of Jehovah's perfect activity, contains enormous variety.

00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:37.269
Our perfect earth is likewise filled with variety, change, and contrast.

00:16:37.269 --> 00:16:58.269
It allows for the simple and the complex, the plain and the fancy, the sour and the sweet, the rough and the smooth, the metals and the woods, the mountains and the valleys.

00:16:58.269 --> 00:17:17.269
It embraces the stimulating freshness of early spring, the warmth of summer, the liveliness of autumn colors, and the pure beauty of freshly fallen snow.

00:17:17.269 --> 00:17:26.269
Perfect humans will not be stereotypes with identical personalities, talents and abilities.

00:17:26.269 --> 00:17:40.269
But the beauty is that with all of the variety of appearances, talents and personalities, imperfection will be no more.

00:17:40.269 --> 00:17:53.269
Please be assured that, as we've considered from the Scriptures, Jehovah loves each one of us, despite our appearances, our imperfections.

00:17:53.269 --> 00:18:04.269
May we all fully love and adore Jehovah and his Son, Christ Jesus, in return.

00:18:04.269 --> 00:18:08.269
Thank you, Brother Heard, for those encouraging reminders.

00:18:08.269 --> 00:18:15.269
We know our young people want to look good, but how do you avoid becoming obsessed with how you look?

00:18:15.269 --> 00:18:24.619
That's the topic of the next episode of the series, My Teen Life.

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:35.660
Oh, most definitely I felt awkward. I didn't wear my clothes a certain way, or I didn't hide my hair, kept a certain way.

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:38.660
I didn't wear this latest shoes.

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:44.660
It can be really easy to get cut up on social media and trying to see what the new trends were, trying to see how others look.

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:49.660
Should I look like that? Why don't I look like that? What can I do to look like that?

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:55.660
I paid such a high price for the body I was going after.

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:59.660
I was going after unrealistic beauty standards.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.660
It allowed me to be diagnosed with an eating disorder.

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:13.660
Focusing on my parents too much affected me spiritually, even though I was in service, even though I was present for family worship.

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:17.660
I wasn't focused. I was thinking more of what I'm going to wear tomorrow.

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:20.660
My parents were a great help.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:25.660
They took time to actually listen to my feelings and what I was going through.

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:28.660
It was not necessarily any formal setting.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:33.660
It was actually in informal settings where we can be in the car and we were just talking.

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:40.660
Or we're sitting in the couch watching TV and my dad would just talk to me and kind of see how I was doing how my day went.

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:46.660
My father, he kind of sat me down and he shared two really important scriptures with me.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:52.660
In 1st Peter 3, 3 and 4, which says, do not let your abdomen be external.

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:58.660
You don't want to focus too much on how you look on the outer parents.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:05.660
And the reason being is found in Proverse 31 30, where it says beauty may be fleeting.

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:15.660
So even though we may put so much effort into how we look on the outer parents, eventually that's going to go away.

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:23.660
Something that has really helped me is giving myself time and the day to get off of social media, get off the internet,

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:26.660
and giving time, dedicate time to Jehovah.

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:33.660
I own followed models and influencers that made me feel more insecure by myself.

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:46.660
And I would study Bible characters of the past such as Abigail, Sarah, Ruth, letting myself be influenced by them was a game changer for me.

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:54.660
What made them more beautiful to the eyes of Jehovah were their qualities, how they treated others, their personality,

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.660
how they search Jehovah with loyalty.

00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:00.660
As I examine those scriptures, I feel like something clicked in my head.

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:08.660
Being attractive physically, it just didn't really make much of a difference to me anymore.

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:17.660
Making sure I prayed before my day started, I learned to really let Jehovah in and make my prayers meaningful.

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:23.660
There were a few elders, some even became almost as close as best friends to me.

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:36.220
The elders really helped me when I came to how I could take more attention off of me, how I could focus on helping others.

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:44.220
Knowing that I'm making Jehovah happy by helping others get to know him and making disciples is what makes me happy now.

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:53.220
And as a pioneer, I finally was able to attend my first pioneer school in March of 2021, which was an amazing blessing from Jehovah.

00:21:53.220 --> 00:22:04.390
I worked on being more open to people, being more present, being more available.

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:13.390
And trust me, it paid off for me because eventually I received much more privileges in the congregation.

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:18.390
I was able to serve in different capacities in Jehovah's organization.

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:23.390
And above all, I was more happy.

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:45.890
Thank you, Tony and Samantha, for those candid experiences.

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:53.890
Cultivating kindness and goodness will make us happy and draw us closer to our friends and closer to Jehovah.

00:22:53.890 --> 00:23:04.890
In a recent morning worship program, Brother William Turner explains that these inner qualities don't just make us beautiful to Jehovah, but they also make us valuable to him.

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:10.890
What do you think makes us valuable to Jehovah?

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:14.890
Is it our natural ability?

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:18.890
Our many years of faithful service?

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:21.890
Is it our Bethel assignment?

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:25.890
Well, turn with me and your Bible's to 1 Peter chapter 3.

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:30.890
And we'll let Jehovah answer this through his word for us.

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:35.890
1 Peter chapter 3 and we'll reverse 4.

00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:53.130
But let it be the secret person of the heart in the incorruptible adornment of the quiet and mild spirit, which is of great value in the eyes of God.

00:23:53.130 --> 00:24:01.130
Of course, we know in the full context of the opening verses here in 1 Peter chapter 3, Peter is referring to Christian women.

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:09.130
But if we isolate this phrase in verse 4, the secret person of the heart.

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:22.130
Well, that applies to all of us, brothers and sisters, because it's referring to who we are on the inside, our thoughts, our beliefs, our emotions.

00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:35.130
That's why David prayed in Psalm 51 verse 10 for Jehovah to create within him a pure heart, because that's what Jehovah sees and examines.

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:39.130
That is what is valuable to him.

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:44.130
And that's what all of us are striving to do to serve him in that way.

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:50.130
And the beautiful thing is that when Jehovah sees that we're trying to serve him this way,

00:24:50.130 --> 00:25:02.130
not only does that make us valuable to him, but he will also give us whatever we need in whatever assignment we happen to have.

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:14.130
Now, just to prove this, let's look at three different occasions in various stages of David's life, all related to his assignment in warfare.

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:18.130
We'll start with the account in 1 Samuel chapter 17.

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:28.700
When it was determined that David was going to fight Goliath, you recall that he was clothed with Saul's armor.

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:34.700
Now, luckily, that was quite the privilege to fight with the King's armor.

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:40.700
But notice the middle of verse 39, after David tries it on, look at what happens.

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:48.700
David said to Saul, I am unable to go in these things before I am not used to them.

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:51.700
So David took them off.

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:58.700
So valuable armor, but David wasn't equipped to use it.

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:03.700
It didn't fit him or his circumstances at the time.

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:08.700
But you notice David didn't let that stop him.

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:11.700
Instead, he used what worked for him.

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:21.700
He looked for five smooth stones, and with Jehovah's help, that was more than enough for him to carry out his assignment.

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:26.700
Perhaps we know of brothers and sisters, maybe here at Bethel or in the field,

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:34.700
who at one time may have been hesitant in having a Bible study or engaging in some other aspect of the ministry,

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:42.700
maybe because they felt they didn't have the skill of a seasoned pioneer, and yet they excelled.

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:45.700
And Jehovah blessed their efforts.

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:48.700
You see, they didn't let that stop them.

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:56.700
They just worked with what they had, their love for Jehovah, their sincerity, and Jehovah blessed them.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:04.700
The point is, due to our circumstances, we may not all have the experience, the training,

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:10.700
the figurative king's armor, so to speak, for a particular assignment.

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:15.700
But we still should not let that stop us in our efforts to serve Jehovah.

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:18.700
We find what works for us.

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:26.700
And it may be that for time, we may feel that we're just working with a couple of figurative smooth stones.

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:33.700
But Jehovah says that is more than enough for us to carry out our assignment.

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:36.700
Well, let's consider the second occasion.

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:41.700
Some time later now, David is trained, he's skilled, he's quite the warrior.

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:51.700
And in 1 Samuel 18 verse 4, he gets another privilege, this time, to use the armor of Saul's son, Jonathan.

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:53.700
And he's successful.

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:55.700
He wins many battles.

00:27:55.700 --> 00:28:00.700
To the point where in verse 7, the women are celebrating.

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:05.700
Saul has struck down his thousands, and David, his tens of thousands.

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:10.700
Well, what makes David so successful?

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:15.700
When watched our noted that David's fighting was a matter of courage,

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:21.700
because he repeatedly inquired of Jehovah as to his moving into battle,

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:29.700
showing that he was being guided by Jehovah and not merely love of conquest.

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:32.700
What can we take away from this?

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:37.700
Even if we're privileged to do many things in the organization,

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:48.700
we should never let our intellect, our privilege, our position, our natural abilities stop us from seeking Jehovah's direction first.

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:55.700
That can help us to maintain humility, to keep us valuable to Jehovah.

00:28:55.700 --> 00:29:02.700
Thought it was interesting. The watchtower also mentioned one of the reasons that the women were able to sing and celebrate, David,

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:08.700
was because of how David inspired his men in battle.

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:13.700
So clearly, David must have worked along well with others.

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:18.700
He encouraged his men. He motivated them. He brought out the best in them.

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:26.700
And together, they were able to have many victories in behalf of Jehovah.

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:31.700
Well, isn't that a nice reminder for family heads, congregation elders,

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:34.700
our overseers and crew leaders here at Bethel?

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:37.700
When we maintain the right disposition,

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:44.700
Jehovah can use us to inspire, to motivate and encourage those that we work with.

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:52.700
And then together, we can accomplish much to Jehovah's praise.

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:58.700
One final occasion, this time in 2 Samuel.

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:04.700
At this point, David is now older. He's won many battles.

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:09.700
But in yet another war with the Palestinians, notice what happens to him.

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:23.420
This 2 Samuel chapter 21, 2 Samuel chapter 21, will read verse 15.

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:28.420
It says so once again, there was a war between the Palestinians and Israel.

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:35.420
So David and his servants went down and fought the Philistines, but David became exhausted.

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:45.019
This time, David, even with his armor, was in a situation that almost got him killed.

00:30:45.019 --> 00:30:50.019
Now, the courage was still there, but his strength wasn't.

00:30:50.019 --> 00:30:53.019
He was exhausted.

00:30:53.019 --> 00:31:02.019
So in verse 17, how grateful he must have been that men like Abishai had kept an eye on him

00:31:02.019 --> 00:31:05.019
and quickly came to his aid.

00:31:05.019 --> 00:31:11.019
If you go back a couple of chapters to chapter 18, in verses 3 and 4,

00:31:11.019 --> 00:31:15.019
this matter of David going out to fight had come up before.

00:31:15.019 --> 00:31:23.019
But you notice when you look at those verses, it was not as if the men were stopping David from doing anything.

00:31:23.019 --> 00:31:28.019
They just wanted him to do work that fit his circumstances.

00:31:28.019 --> 00:31:33.019
And in verse 4, we see the wisdom of David in agreeing to do so.

00:31:33.019 --> 00:31:41.390
But doesn't this make us think of our dear, faithful older ones in the family?

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:46.390
We love all of you so dearly, we hold you in high esteem.

00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:54.390
And we know that Jehovah treasures and values you as well, because he sees your heart.

00:31:54.390 --> 00:32:05.390
And he knows that your strength may not be as it once was, but your faith, your love, your courage, your zeal.

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:10.390
It's all there, and it's the strongest ever.

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:17.390
So we're so appreciative of our brotherhood, this Bethel family, where we have members like Abishai,

00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:25.390
where it's such a privilege for them and us to come to your aid and support when we can.

00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:35.390
And Jehovah certainly appreciates your willingness to do whatever work you're able to do as it fits your circumstances.

00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:44.390
So what a reminder it is to know that it's not our strength or natural ability that draws us closer to Jehovah.

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:51.390
It's that secret person of the heart, a pure heart that makes us valuable to God.

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:59.390
And when we serve him in that way, he will give us whatever we need, regardless of our situation or circumstances,

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:04.390
to always serve him in a way that he approves.

00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:07.390
What brother Turner said is true.

00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:17.390
Jehovah values us and will give us what we need to fulfill our commission to preach, even if we feel we lack strength or natural abilities.

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:22.390
Our music video this month is entitled, He knows us.

00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:30.390
It reassures us that when we are discouraged or tired or afraid, Jehovah knows how we feel.

00:33:30.390 --> 00:33:51.089
When we were woven in the depths of the earth, before we even came into this world,

00:33:51.089 --> 00:34:04.670
Jehovah saw right from the start, beeped down inside our beating heart.

00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:11.110
Just stop and think what that means.

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:15.110
He knows you. He knows me.

00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:17.110
What we feel.

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:19.110
What we see.

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:22.110
When we try hard to give our best.

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:25.110
The joys we feel and our regrets.

00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:27.110
He knows you.

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:29.110
He knows me.

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:31.110
What we need.

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:33.110
What we believe.

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:39.110
When we can find the words to say we're not alone.

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:53.019
He knows like a father wants his child to succeed.

00:34:53.019 --> 00:34:57.719
That's how he feels about you.

00:34:57.719 --> 00:35:08.300
He sifts through us and sees where we shine.

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:14.300
And who we can be in paradise.

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:18.300
So always know that he cares.

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:21.869
He knows you.

00:35:21.869 --> 00:35:23.869
He knows me.

00:35:23.869 --> 00:35:25.869
What we feel.

00:35:25.869 --> 00:35:27.869
What we see.

00:35:27.869 --> 00:35:30.869
When we try hard to give our best.

00:35:30.869 --> 00:35:33.869
The joys we feel and our regrets.

00:35:33.869 --> 00:35:35.869
He knows you.

00:35:35.869 --> 00:35:37.869
He knows me.

00:35:37.869 --> 00:35:39.869
What we need.

00:35:39.869 --> 00:35:47.719
What we believe is to say we're not alone.

00:35:47.719 --> 00:35:56.949
He knows.

00:35:56.949 --> 00:35:59.949
He knows you, he knows me.

00:35:59.949 --> 00:36:02.949
What we need.

00:36:02.949 --> 00:36:19.530
What we plead.

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:34.940
Is so catchy and uplifting.

00:36:34.940 --> 00:37:39.719
I think we'll all be singing.

00:37:39.719 --> 00:37:41.719
He knows us for days to come.

00:37:41.719 --> 00:37:43.719
Discouragement and cage.

00:37:43.719 --> 00:37:53.980
us for days to come. Discouragement can be a powerful enemy. In the April 22nd, 2001 issue of

00:37:53.980 --> 00:38:01.340
a wake, Janice Adams told how Jehovah helped her overcome discouragement and maintain a positive

00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:12.630
attitude despite many trials. Let's find out how she's doing now. I was born deaf and I attended a

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:22.280
school for the deaf. Later, I attended college. While I was there, I noticed that my vision was

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:29.559
deteriorating and I couldn't understand why. I was informed that I was going blind. I was stunned.

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:37.000
I was also given an article and in the article, I noticed one sentence that said,

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:44.860
deaf blind people are the loneliest people in the world. I was devastated.

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:56.260
Being both deaf and blind is challenging. I've had to learn how to live independently,

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:05.880
but the most important thing that I've learned is learning about Jehovah, the true God.

00:39:13.849 --> 00:39:19.530
Some people might imagine that a deaf blind person would be too limited to serve Jehovah fully.

00:39:20.489 --> 00:39:24.969
That's far from the truth. Let me give you some examples of my service.

00:39:26.409 --> 00:39:30.889
Some of the ways that I support the congregation are by attending meetings,

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:40.380
being regular in service. Sometimes I can be helpful in training others how to be more effective

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:48.139
teachers. I often join others on their Bible studies. I've been able to pioneer for many years

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:57.139
and this is something that I really enjoy. Over the years, my husband and I have had the

00:39:57.139 --> 00:40:04.260
opportunity to preach in many countries. In some of the countries, the deaf ministry was just

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:12.980
getting started. For example, we went to Honduras in Central America. They only had two small groups.

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:20.420
We first went for a few months, then returned and stayed for a year. What a great experience

00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:28.340
to participate and see the growth in the field. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic,

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:34.500
I was accustomed to being a self-sufficient person. For example, I could go out on my own with

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:43.909
my guide dog. We could go to the Kingdom Hall to meet the brothers and sisters, but then COVID-19

00:40:43.909 --> 00:40:55.289
hit and I was stuck at home, isolated. While it's true that we still had meetings and service

00:40:55.289 --> 00:41:04.469
arrangements on Zoom, it wasn't easy. The only person who could interpret for me was my husband.

00:41:05.429 --> 00:41:15.670
No one else. It was tough. He was exhausted. We both were. It was something we had to endure.

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:24.500
In time, when it became safe enough, a few of the brothers and sisters volunteered to come

00:41:25.139 --> 00:41:33.619
and help interpret. That really built me up. I could finally have direct contact with my friends.

00:41:35.619 --> 00:41:41.219
I was thrilled. I also received a lot of support from the congregation.

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:46.420
There are many willing volunteers to tactile interpret for me at the meetings.

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:54.420
That gives me joy. I always know that if I have a problem, I can share my thoughts and feelings

00:41:54.420 --> 00:42:02.949
with others. They will listen and support me, no matter what the future brings.

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:09.829
I remember the scripture at Isaiah 41-10. It says,

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:19.750
Do not be afraid for I am with you. I know that Jehovah encourages me. He will help me.

00:42:20.949 --> 00:42:30.940
I don't have to worry. While it's true that I'm deaf and blind, I'm not one of the

00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:37.690
loneliest people in the world. I'm a happy person because I have many friends.

00:42:38.329 --> 00:42:48.409
I have the joy of helping others to learn about God and I have the best friend ever, Jehovah.

00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:07.400
Our faith grows strong when we imitate the faith of fellow Christians like Janice and those in

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:15.079
the Bible who love Jehovah. When we read God's Word, we want to visualize what life was like for

00:43:15.159 --> 00:43:22.840
these people of faith. We want to see what they saw, hear what they heard, and feel what they felt.

00:43:23.719 --> 00:43:31.639
We must immerse ourselves in their stories. We're happy to debut a new series that we hope

00:43:31.639 --> 00:43:40.199
will help you do just that. Please enjoy the first episode of the series, imitate their faith.

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:52.809
Dinner's almost ready. Please tell Shem. We'll be right there, Mom.

00:43:52.809 --> 00:43:59.130
Well, Abram, before we go in, let me tell you the rest. I was just a young man back then.

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:06.659
After Jehovah gave my father the command to build the ark, it took decades to complete.

00:44:10.969 --> 00:44:13.690
Then we had to gather food and all the animals.

00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:24.150
We had no idea how long we would be inside. But when Jehovah closed the ark's door,

00:44:25.110 --> 00:44:33.059
we were ready. So were you scared?

00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:38.739
Abram, I know you're just a boy, but things have happened to you that have scared you, right?

00:44:40.099 --> 00:44:46.820
I was older than you, but I was still scared. When we were building the ark, people thought we were

00:44:46.820 --> 00:45:30.659
crazy. And then, just like Jehovah said it would, it happened. Only eight were saved. My parents,

00:45:30.659 --> 00:45:36.340
my brothers, and our wives. We are living proof that Jehovah's word never fails.

00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:42.179
Jehovah promised my father that he would never again destroy all life of a global flood.

00:45:43.219 --> 00:45:49.619
I want you to know I was scared, but I know to trust Jehovah. When Jehovah promises something that

00:45:49.619 --> 00:45:56.420
we've never seen, it takes a special quality to believe it. Do you know what that quality is?

00:45:57.059 --> 00:45:58.420
Faith.

00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:26.059
Abraham and Sarah lived in earth, a city full of people who worshiped pagan gods,

00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:32.340
but like Noah and Shem, Abraham and Sarah worshiped Jehovah.

00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:56.760
Wow, from your land, and from your relatives, and come into the land that I will show you.

00:47:33.579 --> 00:47:38.780
Where will we live? We'll be so far away from our family.

00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:44.539
I have every confidence that if we do, a Jehovah asks that things will turn out fine.

00:47:45.739 --> 00:47:56.300
Well, wherever it is, I will be by your side. There is nothing I would even sacrifice for Jehovah.

00:47:57.260 --> 00:48:09.079
I know. Abraham and Sarah, I left earth. They lived in hay ran for some time,

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:16.579
but Jehovah told Abraham to keep moving. Living in tents was not easy.

00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:21.460
But the caravan gradually settled into a routine of travel.

00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:36.199
Abraham's nephew Lot was like a brother to him, but as their flocks grew large,

00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:49.239
tension grew between their groups. Please, there should be no quarreling between me and you

00:48:49.239 --> 00:48:56.199
for we are brothers, is not the whole land available to you. Please separate from me.

00:48:57.239 --> 00:49:00.519
If you go to the left, then I will go to the right.

00:49:02.519 --> 00:49:10.969
Though it must have hurt their hearts, they agreed to part ways. Lot moved east to the district

00:49:10.969 --> 00:49:20.599
of the Jordan, where the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were located. After Lot had gone,

00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:30.710
Jehovah made a promise about Abraham's future. Raise your eyes, please, and look from the place

00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:39.349
where you are, to the north and south, east and west. Because all the land that you see,

00:49:40.389 --> 00:49:44.309
I will give to you and your offspring as a lasting possession.

00:49:45.429 --> 00:49:49.030
And I will make your offspring like the dust particles of the earth.

00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:45.900
Abraham, do not fear, Abraham. I am a shield for you. Your reward will be very great.

00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:52.860
Sauer Lord Jehovah, what will you give me, saying that I continue childless?

00:50:53.980 --> 00:51:03.659
Go outside. Look up. Please, to the heavens and count the stars. If you are able to do so,

00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:17.400
so your offspring will become. Later, Jehovah changed Abrams name to Abraham,

00:51:18.119 --> 00:51:27.079
which means father of a multitude. He also changed Sarah's name to Sarah, which means princess.

00:51:29.079 --> 00:51:40.519
Every day, these new names would remind them of Jehovah's promise. And Jehovah didn't stop there.

00:51:42.699 --> 00:51:52.500
He sent three angels to reassure Abraham with even more good news. Within the year,

00:51:52.579 --> 00:52:05.820
he and Sarah would have a son, but they also brought other news.

00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:10.139
Through one of the angels, Jehovah said,

00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:15.980
The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is indeed great, and their sin is very heavy.

00:52:32.730 --> 00:52:38.570
Will you really sweep away the righteous with the wicked? Suppose there are 50 righteous men within

00:52:38.570 --> 00:52:45.369
the city. Will you then sweep them away and not pardon the place for the sake of the 50 righteous

00:52:45.369 --> 00:52:53.639
who are inside it? It's unthinkable of you. Will the judge of all the earth not do it as right?

00:52:56.360 --> 00:53:01.960
If I find Sodom 50 righteous men in the city, I will pardon the whole place for their sake.

00:53:03.719 --> 00:53:11.429
Please hear I presume to speak to Jehovah, whereas I am dust and ashes. Suppose a 50 righteous should

00:53:11.429 --> 00:53:19.670
lack five. Because the five will you destroy the whole city? Abraham knew that the judge of all the

00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:25.989
earth always does what is right, but knowing and trusting are two different things.

00:53:26.869 --> 00:53:32.389
I will not destroy it for the sake of the 20. Jehovah, please do not become hot with anger,

00:53:32.389 --> 00:53:42.139
but let me speak just once more. Suppose only 10 are found there. I will not destroy it for the sake

00:53:42.139 --> 00:53:58.869
of the 10. I have seen in my life that everything that Jehovah promises always comes true.

00:53:59.829 --> 00:54:17.539
Throughout your life, have full confidence, Jehovah will always do what is right. Do you want to see

00:54:17.539 --> 00:54:27.380
part two of the story of Abraham? Me too. But we have to wait till next month, so be sure to tune in.

00:54:28.099 --> 00:54:36.500
Imitate their faith has been a beloved series in the Watchtower magazine since 2008,

00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:46.019
and more recently it's been online at jw.org. Note this excerpt from the introduction to

00:54:46.019 --> 00:54:55.460
the printed edition. Are they that real to you? Imagine what it would be like to walk and talk

00:54:55.619 --> 00:55:03.139
with them to spend time getting to know such men and women as Noah, Abraham,

00:55:03.139 --> 00:55:10.019
Ruth, Elijah, and Esther. Think of the influence they might have on your life,

00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:16.019
the precious words of advice and encouragement they might offer.

00:55:17.139 --> 00:55:23.780
It's our earnest prayer that you'll use this new series to build a faith that's equal to any

00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:33.500
test that comes your way. We've enjoyed a delightful program. We learn that Jehovah's love is not

00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:41.900
based on appearance or imperfection. When we serve him as best we can, we are beautiful in his eyes.

00:55:43.179 --> 00:55:51.659
Our life segment reminded us that striving for the world's beauty standards can rob us of our

00:55:51.659 --> 00:55:59.019
self-esteem, but building the inner qualities Jehovah values can make us truly happy.

00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:09.340
In our music video, reassured us that through hard times and hard feelings, Jehovah understands us

00:56:10.059 --> 00:56:19.050
and knows what we need. Thank you, Brother Heard, and please thank the governing body for

00:56:19.050 --> 00:56:27.750
providing the new Imitate Their Faith series. Our video postcard this month comes from a land of

00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:37.269
sweeping vistas and dramatic scenery, Japan. On Japan's largest island of Honshu, we find the Tohoku

00:56:37.269 --> 00:56:46.150
region renowned for its hot springs, cold and snowy winters, delicious rice, and fresh seafood.

00:56:47.110 --> 00:56:55.349
Facing the Pacific Ocean is the stunning San Riku coast. Over 250 kilometers of zig-zag granite cliffs,

00:56:55.989 --> 00:57:02.949
some rising 200 meters out of the sea. Tourists can ride the San Riku railway along the coast

00:57:02.949 --> 00:57:09.110
to see the spectacular views. Those who want to stretch their legs and appreciate the natural

00:57:09.110 --> 00:57:16.550
splendor on foot can walk the more than 1,000 kilometer Michinoku coastal trail, which stretches from

00:57:16.550 --> 00:57:24.949
the Almore prefecture to the Fukushima prefecture. Fukushima was the site of a nuclear disaster that

00:57:24.949 --> 00:57:32.070
followed the terrible earthquake and tsunami in March of 2011. Thousands lost their loved ones,

00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:36.630
homes, their livelihood. The devastation was felt throughout the country.

00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:45.429
155 congregations were in the area affected by the tsunami. Despite the difficult conditions,

00:57:45.429 --> 00:57:53.909
277 elders moved in to comfort and assist the congregations. Our Japanese brothers and sisters

00:57:53.909 --> 00:57:59.989
wanted to comfort others and were eager to resume organized preaching. Within a month,

00:58:00.070 --> 00:58:04.710
publishers were sharing the Bible's message of hope with their neighbors. As they went out,

00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:10.230
they contacted many inactive ones who have since resumed associated with the congregation.

00:58:11.989 --> 00:58:18.469
12 years later, Jehovah's people continue searching for sheep-like ones. Let's visit three

00:58:18.469 --> 00:58:25.429
congregations in the San Riku area. These congregations, each with fewer than 60 publishers,

00:58:25.429 --> 00:58:32.070
still deliver a mighty shout of praise. The tsunami and resulting disaster had a big

00:58:32.070 --> 00:58:39.349
effect on those in the territory. Many began to realize that spiritual things are more important

00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:47.030
than what we can see. Our brothers have done their best to fill the void that many are feeling

00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:55.190
with the Bible's message of hope. Since the 2011 disaster, 20 Bible students have dedicated

00:58:55.190 --> 00:59:04.150
themselves to Jehovah and have gotten baptized. The Kamaishi Ofunato and Riku's Entakata congregations

00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:11.269
send their Christian love and affection. From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:59:11.269 --> 00:59:21.269
this is J.W. Broadcasting.
