00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:15.580
Did I enjoy memorizing presentations?

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.579
No.

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:20.579
I think I just got used to memorizing presentations.

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:23.579
It was something we did since we were kids.

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:25.579
I found that it was kind of hit or miss

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:27.579
in the way that people responded.

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:29.579
Sometimes they responded well, sometimes they didn't,

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.579
because maybe there wasn't a subject that interested down.

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.579
When I was feeling kind of unsure, like what to do,

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.579
I'd probably just bail out with.

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.579
I don't want to take too much of your time right now.

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.579
And I was nice talking with you and maybe some other time.

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:49.530
I read and studied the brochure completely.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.530
Honestly, I felt that I got this.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.530
I didn't.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.530
When we first got this brochure, I was very intimidated

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.530
because I was so used to the method that we used before.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.530
I was at the airport and the guy behind me,

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.530
he's complaining about the heating floor there

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.530
and that the only reason why he was there

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.530
is because of a funeral.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.530
I stopped him and I said, excuse me,

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.530
I overheard you saying that you were here for a funeral.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.530
Who died?

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.530
And he said, my mother-in-law.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.530
Then I remember I have a magazine about comfort for those

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:24.530
who grieve.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.530
And then I pulled the magazine out and the conversation was done.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.530
In my mind, I said, wow, wow.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.530
He ain't gonna talk no more.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.530
He didn't.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.530
I love our new approach because people can see Jehovah's

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.530
people as loving, caring, people, not just preachers.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.530
Because there's no agenda necessarily,

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.530
you're not trying to leave a specific publication,

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.530
you feel more relaxed.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.530
And oftentimes the conversation's naturally gonna go there.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.530
And sometimes it doesn't lead to opening up to a scripture.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.530
It's just talking about their crazy situation at work

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.530
or something else going on in their family.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.530
But it's okay because I made a friend.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.530
So this lady,

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.530
I was about to pay and she had these-

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:15.530
Very colorful nails.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.530
Long colorful decorated nails.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.530
And it's like she wanted me to say something about her nails.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.530
Yeah, she definitely wanted to make a statement with that.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.530
So I said, girl, your nails look good.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.530
And she was like, oh well, my nails have a meaning.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.530
And I'm like, they do?

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.530
And she's like, yeah, I want to support-

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.530
domestic violence-

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.530
domestic awareness month.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.530
And I'm like, well, you really care about people.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.530
Yeah, we went to the website.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:42.530
Yeah, we showed the website.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.530
And the feature article for that month was literally

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.530
about domestic abuse.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.530
And she got to see some Bible principles

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.530
and she took that with her.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.530
And we had a good conversation.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.530
My wife and I were working together in a territory.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.530
And we were walking back to our cause.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.530
So a man across the street in the block that was already done.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.530
And we asked him how his week has been going.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.530
That led to us asking what sort of work he did.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.530
From that bit of interest, he really appreciated it.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.530
He loved what we had to say.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.530
And so he actually just asked out of the blue for a study.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.530
After we showed him the enjoy life wherever brochure,

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.530
he's attended many meetings and been a good return visit.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.530
When I entered a shop,

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.530
I started a conversation with the owner.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.530
I asked, how long have you been doing this job?

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.530
We talked about a lot of things.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.530
Then naturally, she started expressing

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.530
how she always had questions about life.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.530
I then offered a Bible study,

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.530
and she accepted the offer with interest.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.530
From then on, we have been studying each week

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.530
and about five months have passed.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.530
But we continue to enjoy the discussions.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.530
I was walking through a park one day,

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.530
and I saw a family.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.530
I had a beautiful conversation.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.530
I asked a few questions,

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.530
and listening to them,

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.530
I was really able to hear the concerns of their heart

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.530
regarding the future for their daughter.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.530
I offered a Bible study.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.529
She's been studying now every week,

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:20.529
and she attended the convention for the first time this year,

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:25.540
and she's been attending meetings.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.540
By us showing them some love,

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.540
they might feel like they might be worthy

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.540
of more love than just from us,

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.540
but from their creator.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.540
This has really helped me to view them

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.540
as a potential servant of Jehovah,

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.540
as one of my brothers and sisters.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.540
I don't want to be that obstacle.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.540
Let me listen.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:45.540
Let me be patient.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:51.540
Let me be humble and wait to see at the right time.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.540
But my goal is still the same.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.540
I'm going to talk about my God, Jehovah.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.540
I just know so fast.
