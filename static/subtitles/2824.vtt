00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:24.109
David had been pursued ruthlessly by Saul.

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.109
He and his men faced hunger, fear, and threat of death.

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.369
It's Saul.

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:39.369
Today God has surrendered your enemy into your hand.

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:42.369
Let me pin him to the ground.

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:49.380
David could have ended his trial then and there.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.380
But he was a man of love.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:01:02.530
Over the standpoint that you lift my hand against the anointing of Jehovah.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:20.060
Despite all that Saul had done, David left the judging to Jehovah who he loved and trusted.
