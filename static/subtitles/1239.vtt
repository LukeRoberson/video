00:00:56.049 --> 00:01:08.379
The years have gone by so quickly, I never imagined seeing a time when even the smallest

00:01:08.379 --> 00:01:16.299
tasks would be such a struggle. Even the little I can still do for Jehovah seemed so useless.

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:30.290
But I know when I start to feel like this, I have to fight it. It reminds me of Romans 12-12.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:45.599
Rejoice in the hope. Endure under tribulation. Persevere in prayer. Rejoice in the hope.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.120
I need to remind myself this isn't the finish line. It's just part of the race.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:02:32.560
Wait Jacqueline, I have to stop by the hole and grab some chucks. You ready for a little letter ready?

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:36.800
Yes. Yes I am.
