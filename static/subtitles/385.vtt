00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.089
He does not go back on his promise.

00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:07.290
Now, those words say a lot about a person, don't they?

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.929
What Bible examples are there of those who please Jehovah by keeping their promise?

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.730
And what is in store for those who do so even when it is bad for them?

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.210
Well, we know Jesus, of course, is a foremost example of one who kept his promise to do

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:31.289
Jehovah as well, but imperfect people too have displayed loyalty by keeping their promises.

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:39.009
For instance, in Joshua 9, we read that the Ghiblianites tricked the chieftains of Israel

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:45.210
into concluding a covenant of peace with them, unwittingly the Israelites promised not

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.810
to destroy Ghiblian.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:53.490
What makes this of special interest is that those disguised men were part of the high-vite

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.929
nation which was considered to be a threat to Israel.

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:05.650
And Joshua 10 verse 2, it says, that all of Ghiblian's men were warriors.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.810
What happened when Israel learned the truth?

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:15.890
Joshua 9 verse 18 tells us the Israelites did not attack them because the chieftains of

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:23.290
the assembly had sworn an oath to them by Jehovah the God of Israel.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.849
Did Jehovah prove of their decision not to attack them?

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:33.090
Yes, he did, as events recorded in Joshua 10 go on to prove, and we'll come back to

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.090
that in a few minutes.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.450
In another example, Mordecai urged Esther to go in before King Haji Eres and plead for

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.769
his favor on behalf of the Jews.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.609
Now, Esther knew that going in unannounced could mean her life.

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:54.849
Mordecai, however, reasoned with her about the matter, and the importance of doing so

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:59.769
and Esther gave him her word that she would go in.

00:01:59.769 --> 00:02:06.530
Please notice what she says in Esther chapter 4 and verse 16.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.650
In the final part of that verse, she's really giving her word.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:15.210
She says, I will go into the king, which is against the law.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.090
And if I am to perish, I will perish.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.810
What we know how it turned out for Esther, Mordecai, and the Jews, Esther kept her word

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.050
and they were all blessed for it, weren't they?

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.090
Why did such ones live up to their word?

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.330
Because among other things, they had qualities such as faith, loyalty, and love for Jehovah

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.729
and for others.

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:45.289
The chieftains of Israel had faith and viewed Jehovah as real and being aware of their

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:48.050
promise to the Ghibbi inites.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.650
Out of faith and loyalty, they would not go back on their word.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:59.169
Also Esther was moved by love to see the greater good and to put her own life at risk in order

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:01.569
to help her people.

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.770
Now going back to our second question, what is in store for those to keep their promises

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.490
even when it is bad for them?

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.930
Let's look at the principle found at Mark chapter 4 and verse 24.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:24.580
Now here Jesus said in part, with the measure that you are measuring out, you will have

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.539
it measured out to you.

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:30.580
Yes, you will have more added to you.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.139
Well, what is the principle here?

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:42.500
As the context shows, Jesus was speaking about a person receiving information and enlightenment

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.620
by paying attention to his words.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:52.580
But this thought of having more added can be seen in many ways, for example.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:59.139
When we're loyal to Jehovah, he often blesses us with more than we might expect at times

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:01.340
even a surprise.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.780
Saul made four eleven says of him, Jehovah will not hold back anything good from those

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.539
walking in integrity.

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:16.379
Now going back to what happened with Israel and the Ghibbi inites, we read in Joshua chapter

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:23.319
8 that in an earlier battle against AI, Jehovah helped Israel with a strategy that led

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:25.120
to victory.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.399
But the account does not say that he performed astounding miracles in doing so.

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:38.279
On the other hand, in Joshua chapter 10, we find something more.

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:42.439
After the Ghibbi inites tricked the chieftains of Israel into making that covenant of peace

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:49.079
with them, the Ghibbi inites were threatened by an alliance of five kings of the Emirates.

00:04:49.079 --> 00:04:51.439
What would the Israelites do?

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:57.360
As we know, they kept their promise and went to defend one out to defend the Ghibbi inites.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:04.639
In verse 7 of chapter 10, we read that Joshua and all his fighting men went out to do this.

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:08.600
As they kept their word, Jehovah blessed them.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:15.000
In verse 8, he said to them, do not be afraid, not one of them will also be able to stand

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.879
against you.

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:20.079
Because Jehovah was pleased with their decision, wasn't he?

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:23.600
He showed his approval in a marvelous way.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.199
Giant hailstones dropped down on their enemies.

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:33.040
And even the sun remained motionless in the sky for about a whole day.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.839
Chapter 10 in verse 14 says, there has never been a day like that one.

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:41.120
Either before it or after it.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:47.199
And Jehovah listened to the voice of a man for Jehovah was fighting for Israel.

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:52.120
Yes, Jehovah really loved the Israelites, didn't he, for keeping their promise?

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.079
And when the Israelites went to war for Ghibbi in, he supported them.

00:05:56.079 --> 00:05:59.480
Or as they say, he poured it on.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.600
Have you ever sensed Jehovah doing that for you when you stick to a difficult task to

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.800
a promise?

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:11.040
Isn't it true that when we do so, we often look back and see blessings that we never

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:12.959
anticipated.

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:18.160
Among other things, we might be surprised at how our faith has grown, how our love has

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:26.600
deepened, and how things that we may have once viewed as overwhelming are now manageable.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:33.160
One Bethelite who endured in his assignment, in spite of the loss of his mother, said this.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:38.240
He also included some mistreatment by others, he said, sometimes we go through something

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.000
we've never experienced before.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.160
And we may not understand why Jehovah does not do a specific thing we request.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:53.639
But when we endure, we see one, his greater comprehension of the overall situation,

00:06:53.639 --> 00:07:00.000
and two, his desire for us to rely on him and know that he's there for us, and that

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.759
we've not lost his favor when we experience a difficult time in our life.

00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:14.199
As Jehovah helps us, we have to do as Genesis 24, 21 says, and stare in amazement as he answers

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:15.199
our prayers.

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:16.199
End of quote.

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:21.560
Well, that's a beautiful thought, and so the blessings may take a while, but we can

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:27.040
trust that Jehovah will be there to help us at the right time.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:33.560
That happened with Job, he once said, until I die, I will not renounce my integrity.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.399
And he lived up to those words, didn't he?

00:07:36.399 --> 00:07:42.639
So much so that after enduring great sorrow and suffering, he was able to say, my ears have

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:47.480
heard about you, but now I do see you with my eyes.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:54.240
Yes, Job's faith grew, and as we know, Jehovah eventually restored Job's health, doubled

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:59.240
his wealth, and blessed him with a beautiful family.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:05.160
We benefit from such Bible accounts, like Jehovah's servants in the past, we may suffer

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:13.560
from persecution and justice, disaster's grief, disappointments, or serious illness.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:20.600
In addition, we may have to work hard to fulfill our promise to be a good husband, wife,

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.439
or a friend in time of need.

00:08:23.439 --> 00:08:29.220
The list is long, but despite the difficulties or even the pain at times, we can do it.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:36.779
We can imitate the faith of past and present examples and live up to our promises, including

00:08:36.779 --> 00:08:42.179
of course, our dedication vow to Jehovah.

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:48.100
Since Jehovah often does more for us than we might expect, we are confident that what

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:55.340
he holds out for our future is greater than we can now imagine, as Psalm 3119 says of

00:08:55.340 --> 00:09:02.539
Jehovah, how abundant your goodness is, you have stored it up for those who fear you.
