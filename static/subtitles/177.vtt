00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.419
This month I'd like to talk about presenting your gifts to God.

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:09.099
We certainly have every reason to consider this topic.

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:10.900
Well, why is that?

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.300
It's because Jehovah gives us so much.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:21.579
James 1, verse 17 says, every good gift and every perfect present is from above, coming

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:25.500
down from the Father of the celestial lights.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.100
For example, Jehovah allows us to enjoy the gift of life even though our first parents

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.420
tried to take that from us.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.340
He's provided us with a variety of foods.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.539
The environment is just right to support life.

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:51.020
He's given us His precious Word, the Bible, so that we can come to know Him and His purposes.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.460
And the greatest perfect present Jehovah has given us is the ransom.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.179
Jehovah sacrificed a great deal to arrange for Jesus to buy back for us the hope of everlasting

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:04.540
life.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.140
This was at no obligation on Jehovah's part.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.659
It was totally a gift of love.

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.780
Please read with me 1 John 4.9.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.379
My this, the love of God, was revealed in our case that God sent His only begotten Son

00:01:21.379 --> 00:01:25.620
into the world so that we might gain life through Him.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.219
What a gift of love from Jehovah, our God.

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:31.540
What does that move us to do?

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.939
Maybe you've had the experience of a close friend or family member unexpectedly giving

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:41.099
you a valuable gift immediately.

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:42.459
What are you thinking?

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:47.459
You're probably trying to think of what you can give in return.

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:55.540
How much more so would we want to present our gifts to God so as to show our sincere appreciation

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.980
for all He's done?

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:04.420
Let's consider some possible gifts that Jehovah would be pleased to receive from us.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.139
Many of you in our viewing audience have been moved to give your life to Jehovah, dedicating

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:12.939
yourself to do His will.

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:14.780
That's commendable.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.580
That's what Romans 12 urges us to do.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:24.139
However, there are some of you, listening, who've thought about this way of giving back

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:29.780
to Jehovah, but you haven't yet taken this vital step.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.340
Notice the appeal the Apostle Paul makes at Romans 121.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.180
Therefore, I appeal to you by the compassion of God-brothers to present your bodies as

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:47.819
a living sacrifice, wholly unacceptable to God, a sacred service with your power of reason.

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.340
Your life is precious.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.500
Presenting your body your whole soul to God is one of the best gifts you can give to

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.699
Him.

00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:00.979
This involves our sacred service to Jehovah.

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:02.460
That's for sure.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.860
But what about the daily activities of life?

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.740
Some of you do housework on a daily basis.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.659
Others of you have school to attend and homework to do.

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.500
Many of you perform secular work.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.460
They're shopping to do.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:24.740
Others enjoy using a small percentage of their time to engage in some type of recreation

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.300
or entertainment.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:34.539
Once you're dedicated and baptized, this is all part of your gift to Jehovah.

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:41.379
Please consider with me Colossians 323 and 24.

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:47.780
After discussing a whole list of daily activities of life, what does Jehovah tell us?

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.379
Colossians 323 and 24.

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:58.139
Whatever you're doing, work at a whole soul as for Jehovah and not for men.

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:04.099
For you know that it is from Jehovah, you will receive the inheritance as a reward.

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:10.900
It's true that a Christian's day-to-day activities are not part of his sacred service.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:18.699
However, the fact that Paul urges us to work whole soul as to Jehovah makes us think

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:21.339
of our entire course of life.

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:26.180
Yes, our life course can become a gift, present it to God.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:32.660
For example, do we act and dress with proper decorum at all times?

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:39.259
Most notably, we don't wear a suit and tie or dress for every activity of life.

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:47.699
But in whatever you're doing, is your behavior and dress a gift to Jehovah?

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:53.420
If while engaging in any activity, we'd be embarrassed to identify ourselves as one of Jehovah's

00:04:53.420 --> 00:05:01.740
witnesses, then can we really claim to be presenting a gift to Jehovah in our daily life?

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.779
What other gifts are in our possession that we can present to God?

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:09.699
What about God's morality?

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:15.339
Keeping your dedicated body clean morally is a gift to Jehovah.

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:18.980
Did you notice what Romans 121 said?

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:27.139
It said that the bodies we present to Jehovah should be holy and acceptable to God.

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:35.259
If we give into temptation unrepentantly, that could be likened to asking Jehovah to give

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:37.379
our gift back.

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:44.819
We're taking back our dedicated life from Him, which yet is tantamount to taking the gift

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:51.060
away from Jehovah and giving that precious gift to Satan.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.899
That does not make sense.

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:55.699
Keep clean morally.

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:00.660
This precious gift presented to God is true.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.899
When we're dedicated and baptized, there are other gifts that we'd be expected to present

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:09.540
to Jehovah on a regular basis.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:17.060
One of the most obvious ways, as mentioned here at Hebrews 1023, did you already guess what

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.740
this gift to Jehovah would be?

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.949
Hebrews 1023.

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:29.990
Let us whole firmly the public declaration of our hope without wavering.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.310
For the one who promised is faithful.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:40.709
The public declaration of our hope is a gift to those we speak to, but it's also considered

00:06:40.709 --> 00:06:44.069
a gift extended to Jehovah.

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:52.550
In fact, Hebrews 1315 calls our preaching work a sacrifice of praise, that is the fruit

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:58.310
of our lips that make public declaration to His name.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:05.790
Israelites used to regularly offer the best of their animals or grain as sacrificial gifts

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:07.990
to Jehovah.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:13.990
Sharing in the ministry formally or informally is a gift to God.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:19.149
Regularly attending our Christian meetings and participating in them is part of our worship

00:07:19.149 --> 00:07:22.110
and pleases Jehovah.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:25.949
You're familiar with Hebrews 1024 and 25.

00:07:25.949 --> 00:07:32.910
His speaks of our custom of meeting together, and for what purpose do we meet?

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:38.269
If I was there in your home with you, how would you answer?

00:07:38.269 --> 00:07:45.029
You might quickly say, I go to the meetings to be built up and to be encouraged spiritually.

00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:47.589
Well, no doubt you do.

00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:54.829
But that Hebrews 1024 and 25, the purpose of attending is expressed in a totally different

00:07:54.829 --> 00:07:55.829
way.

00:07:55.829 --> 00:08:04.829
Instead of going with a soul intent of being encouraged, verse 24 says, we're to consider

00:08:04.829 --> 00:08:12.949
one another, so as to incite others to love and find works.

00:08:12.949 --> 00:08:19.670
Verse 25 says, we're to be encouraging one another.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:25.350
We should attend our meetings with the goal of being a gift to others.

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.990
Encouraging others is the goal.

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:34.629
We do this by our sincere interest in others before and after the meeting.

00:08:34.629 --> 00:08:38.789
Do you come to the kingdom hall early to encourage others?

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:45.029
When in the traveling work years ago, my wife and I drove into the parking lot and got

00:08:45.029 --> 00:08:46.750
out of our car.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:53.350
Two brothers approached us and warmly said, brother and sister heard, we were waiting for

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:54.350
you.

00:08:54.350 --> 00:09:00.070
We're so happy to have you with our congregation this week.

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:02.110
Were they elders?

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:03.710
Ministerial servants?

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.389
Or pioneered?

00:09:05.389 --> 00:09:06.870
No.

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:11.110
They were two little pre-teenage boys.

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:16.990
That boost gave us a fine start for a special week of activity.

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:21.470
We also encourage others by participating in the meetings.

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:25.110
What an encouragement to the whole congregation.

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:33.470
Of course, if we all go to the meetings with that goal and motive, what will be the result

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:35.789
to us individually?

00:09:35.789 --> 00:09:42.590
We all will come away, build up and encourage spiritually.

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:48.110
But we must never forget that being at our Christian meetings and participating, including

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:57.389
singing, the songs and saying amen to the prayers, is actually worshiping Jehovah.

00:09:57.389 --> 00:10:03.230
You're presenting a gift to him at every meeting you attend.

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:09.549
From ancient times until now, Jehovah's faithful servants have contributed materially to the

00:10:09.549 --> 00:10:12.190
support of true worship.

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:15.070
That's presenting a gift to God as well.

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:19.269
And we thank all of you for your support.

00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:25.269
The governing body is able to provide so much for the benefit of the worldwide brotherhood

00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:29.190
because of your generosity.

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:30.669
Thank you.

00:10:30.669 --> 00:10:33.830
Thank you very much.

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:36.070
What about you, Christian parents?

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:38.870
What gift can you present to Jehovah?

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:40.029
Your children.

00:10:40.029 --> 00:10:46.389
When you do your best to bring your children up in the discipline and admonition of Jehovah,

00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:49.990
you are preparing a gift to your God.

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:55.669
Think of the number of brothers taking the lead in the organization at this time.

00:10:55.669 --> 00:11:04.070
Some are governing body members, helpers, branch committee members, circuit overseers, elders,

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:06.429
and ministerial servants.

00:11:06.429 --> 00:11:10.750
Where did so many of these come from?

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:14.350
Hundreds of thousands were children of Christian parents.

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:19.149
The parents followed the admonition of Ephesians 6, verse 4.

00:11:19.149 --> 00:11:25.470
There are thousands more brothers and sisters that have been raised in the truth by God

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:33.269
and the parents who are spearheading the work in the ministry, in Bethel service, on construction

00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:36.629
projects, and in relief work.

00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:41.830
We thank you, parents, for all that you've done and the precious gifts you've offered

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:45.350
up to Jehovah and his organization.

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:48.350
And what about the older ones in our congregations?

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:53.710
I'm 84 years young with eternity in view.

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:58.509
But at some point we start to admit that we're getting old.

00:11:58.509 --> 00:12:02.309
We start to feel that we're getting old.

00:12:02.309 --> 00:12:06.149
We start to look like we're getting old.

00:12:06.149 --> 00:12:11.309
Some of us find ourselves slipping physically or even mentally.

00:12:11.309 --> 00:12:15.710
Are we becoming less and less valuable to Jehovah?

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:20.149
Is our gift now tarnished by age?

00:12:20.149 --> 00:12:26.649
We might begin to think so, but that's not at all how Jehovah views older ones who have

00:12:26.649 --> 00:12:32.230
dedicated themselves to him possibly many decades ago.

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:39.230
A tarnished gold coin has as much value as a shiny new one.

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:46.029
Probably 1631 instructs us that gray hair is a crown of beauty when it is found in the

00:12:46.029 --> 00:12:49.190
way of righteousness.

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:54.669
There's not so much as the color of the hair, Jehovah's mires, and instead it's the

00:12:54.669 --> 00:13:00.509
life of self-sacrifice that gray hair represents.

00:13:00.509 --> 00:13:07.509
Jehovah views older ones who are still found in the way of righteousness to be precious gifts

00:13:07.509 --> 00:13:09.309
to him.

00:13:09.309 --> 00:13:16.309
Why do pieces of antique furniture often cost much more than a brand new piece of furniture?

00:13:16.309 --> 00:13:25.750
Or why is an older bottle of fine wine often more expensive than a newer vintage wine?

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:30.029
Age brings value to a gift.

00:13:30.029 --> 00:13:36.990
You older ones have wisdom and experience that others in the congregation can benefit

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:37.990
from.

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:45.309
It's not that you need to be holding the microphone and waxing eloquent on every paragraph

00:13:45.309 --> 00:13:51.429
at a meeting, but modestly sharing your experience and wisdom with others on a personal

00:13:51.429 --> 00:13:56.269
basis can be so helpful and encouraging.

00:13:56.269 --> 00:14:05.629
Jehovah loves you older ones, so even if you're bent with age in your mind, stand tall

00:14:05.629 --> 00:14:09.549
as a precious gift presented to Jehovah.

00:14:09.549 --> 00:14:18.309
We all of us, young and old, consider how we can enhance our gifts presented to Jehovah.

00:14:18.309 --> 00:14:26.230
If we have not yet dedicated our life to God, is it time to seriously consider this gift?

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:33.070
Can we enhance our gift by more closely monitoring our view of Christian morality?

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:38.669
What we look at or think about could compromise our gift to God.

00:14:38.669 --> 00:14:45.509
How about our ministry or attendance and participation at the meetings or contributing materially

00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:48.149
to the worldwide work?

00:14:48.149 --> 00:14:56.909
You parents, do your best to package the gift of your children so that they will be

00:14:56.909 --> 00:14:59.509
useful to Jehovah.

00:14:59.509 --> 00:15:06.870
And you older ones, never forget that when it comes to wisdom and experience, you only

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:09.950
get better with age.

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:13.470
Jesus is the best of Jehovah's servants.

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:15.549
He's been around the longest.
