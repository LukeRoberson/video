00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:11.179
From the moment we can talk, we ask questions.

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:14.910
Why is the sky blue?

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.379
What are the stars made of?

00:00:18.379 --> 00:00:22.690
Why do bad things happen?

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:28.050
Where do we come from?

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.960
Why do people die?

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:41.539
People go to great lengths to find answers.

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:46.539
Today, there is more information available than ever before.

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:49.789
But the big questions,

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:55.789
questions about life, suffering and death still remain.

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:02.729
Where can we find answers?

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:11.760
What if the answers have been there all along in the Bible?

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.760
A lot of people say the Bible is full of myths and legends.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.500
But it's outdated.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.200
Or it's just too hard to understand.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.200
But is the Bible really the problem?

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.200
Or is it what people think they know about the Bible?

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.700
People think the Bible says that God controls the world.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.700
But how could that be?

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.700
This world is out of control.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:02:03.390
It's full of pain and suffering, sickness and death, poverty and disaster.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.389
How could a loving God be responsible for all of this?

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:12.389
What the Bible says may surprise you.

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:17.389
It says the evil one controls the whole world.

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:23.389
In other words, there's an evil power behind the world's problems.

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:28.389
Someone who is pulling the strings behind the scenes.

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:32.389
That's why, no matter how hard we try,

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:37.389
humans just cannot solve the world's problems.

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:43.389
The good news is the Bible says things will not always be like this.

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:47.389
It tells us why we're in this situation,

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:52.389
how God will fix it and how we can deal with it in the meantime.

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:58.500
The Bible is providing answers to life's big questions

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.500
for millions of people around the world.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.500
Would you like to be one of them?

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:14.050
