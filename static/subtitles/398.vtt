00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.750
The scripture that we're considering this morning raises a very interesting question and that is

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:10.189
How is it that we can test Jehovah out?

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:14.589
Didn't Jesus say that we shouldn't test Jehovah?

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:20.910
Well, the simple answer to that question was given in the watchtower back in 1957

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.870
It simply stated there is a wrong way and a right way to put Jehovah to the test

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:32.990
Now how do we know what is the right way and what is the wrong way?

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:39.149
Well, again, but simply it means knowing the difference between faith and

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.740
stupidity

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:48.219
When we consider what the scriptures tell us it helps us to see the line that is the

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.820
demarcation between faith and stupidity

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.100
Consider first of all the good way that we can test out Jehovah

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:06.659
When we think about showing faith in Jehovah having trust in him and then obeying him not waiting for Jehovah to make the first move but rather

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:11.379
To for us first of all to obey him to reach out do what he wants us to do

00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:15.540
That in a figurative way is putting him to the test

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:21.700
Because he's already promised to bless us by us obeying him means that we're showing faith

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.659
It also means that we don't complain

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:31.060
About the things that Jehovah allows to occur in our life and we don't take unnecessary risks

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:33.859
We don't try to fool him

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.099
By acting one way but then pretending to be another way

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.060
So put quite simply again

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.420
The right way for us to test out Jehovah

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.459
Means to trust him to have faith in him to obey him

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.579
Even if it may be difficult to do so

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.299
Well, what about the wrong way to test out Jehovah

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.379
Well, if we were to selfishly complain

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.700
About the things that Jehovah allows to occur in our life

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:10.819
Or if we were to do something stupid something careless

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.099
And expect that Jehovah is going to perform a miracle to save us

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:23.460
Or perhaps we keep pushing Jehovah to do something that really is not in harmony with his will

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.139
Or if we try to fool him by pretending to serve him

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:36.020
But actually doing things that displace him all of those things really would be a stupid act on our part

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:42.340
Now what really do we need to consider with regard to this well? Let's think about

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:47.780
When Jesus made that answer to Satan said you shouldn't put Jehovah to the test

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.460
Let's have a look at the scripture that he based that comment on

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.699
It's found in Deuteronomy chapter 6 and verse 16

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.939
And this gives us a little context to the meaning

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.659
In verse 16 it says you must not put Jehovah your God to the test

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:07.699
The way that you put him to the test that master

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:18.099
Now really what was it that these relights did at this particular time where the name of the location where they were meant testing or trial

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.900
Well, if we turn back to Exodus

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:30.099
17 and verse 7 it gives us some idea of what really this involved say Exodus 17 verse 7

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:36.419
So they named the place master and meribur because of the quarreling of these relights

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:43.620
And because they put Jehovah to the test by saying is Jehovah in our midst or not

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.060
So what did these relights do here?

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:57.219
Obviously they didn't trust Jehovah enough they didn't have enough faith in Jehovah to realize that he wasn't going to let them all die in the wilderness

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:05.300
But they pushed him they wanted something immediately they wanted to satisfy their selfish desires

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:11.699
Well, that's a very good lesson for us isn't it because this shows a lack of faith

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.819
We could consider

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.819
When the Israelites decided that they didn't want to go into the promised land

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:23.540
Remember they were so upset with the report of the two good

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.699
Chieftains who had spied out the land they wanted to kill them

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.540
They accepted the report of the ten who had a negative report

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:35.860
And why did they do that again lack of faith in Jehovah

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.939
But then when Jehovah told them what was going to happen the punishment that was going to come on them

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:43.540
What did they do?

00:04:44.019 --> 00:04:50.980
They went straight ahead and decided to go into the promised land and what happened you see it was an act of stupidity

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:58.579
They were going on their own and Jehovah wasn't going to give them support and that's exactly what happened they were defeated

00:04:59.459 --> 00:05:02.740
So we see this is a very interesting example for us

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:09.220
To understand the difference between the wrong way and the right way of putting Jehovah to the test

00:05:10.019 --> 00:05:17.459
And more importantly we need to remember how Jehovah feels when we put him to the test in the wrong way

00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:20.819
And we can see this if we turn to the book of Psalms

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.540
Psalms 78 and verses 40 and 41

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.839
How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness and made him feel hurt in the desert

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.240
Again and again they put God to the test and they grieved the Holy One of Israel

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:49.680
Yes, by their lack of faith and by doing things that we could say irritated or disappointed Jehovah

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.160
They grieved Jehovah

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.399
So this is a very important matter for us to

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.439
Realize the difference between the right and wrong way of putting Jehovah to the test

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:03.920
With regard to this what sort of things do we need to avoid?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.720
Well, we need to avoid dictating or demanding that Jehovah does certain special things for us

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:16.639
We need to avoid complaining to him about our expectations

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.680
We need to avoid taking unnecessary risks and chances

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:27.920
And that's why we have a very important group of brothers that help to remind us about safety

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.879
We do need to remember safety standards

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:36.639
Now some perhaps do not realize the difference between faith and stupidity

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:38.319
And they may have the viewpoint

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:42.240
Well, Jehovah will look after me if I'm doing whatever I'm doing

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.720
But notice what the awake magazine said back in 1953

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:51.759
It was in the article entitled you must not put God to the test

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.439
And this is what it says

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:58.240
It really amounts to considering ourselves very important

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.920
When we act as though nothing could happen to us because we are serving Jehovah

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:10.560
We dare not put God to the test with irrational actions and carelessness

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:17.519
We simply cannot expect God to furnish us angels to keep us from harm and accident

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:20.560
In spite of what we may or may not do

00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:24.720
Well, that's a good reminder for all of us isn't it?

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:29.199
I know as a missionary this is a lesson I had to learn over the years

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.000
The difference between faith and stupidity

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:37.279
What I look back on the first few years I was in my missionary assignment

00:07:37.759 --> 00:07:44.240
And some of the scary things we did jumping off ships into little boats in the open sea without life jackets

00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:46.959
At the time I thought it was an act of faith

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.480
But now I view it a little differently

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:58.480
So we do need to be careful to measure what we're doing and see if it really is an act of faith

00:07:58.959 --> 00:08:01.199
Or if it's just doing something stupid

00:08:02.959 --> 00:08:06.160
Jesus showed great wisdom in this regard didn't he?

00:08:06.959 --> 00:08:09.680
When he served Jehovah here on earth

00:08:10.639 --> 00:08:13.759
No doubt many times his life was endangered

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:19.120
Because the Pharisees and the Sadraces were opposed him they were looking for ways to kill him

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.319
But because he was serving Jehovah doing what Jehovah wanted he had trust in Jehovah

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.000
That he wouldn't be killed before the due time

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:35.120
But on the other hand when Satan tempted him in a way to boldly show off

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:37.519
And jump off the temple

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.759
What did Jesus say?

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.159
You mustn't test Jehovah

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:46.480
You see Jesus realized that that would have been an act of stupidity

00:08:47.519 --> 00:08:51.919
So for us today it's important likewise when we're making decisions

00:08:52.399 --> 00:08:56.320
To balance up very carefully what Jehovah wants us to do

00:08:57.279 --> 00:09:03.279
Yes, when Jehovah makes a promise and says if you put the kingdom first and you do what I want you to do

00:09:03.679 --> 00:09:04.960
I will bless you

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:10.559
Then we reach out and we do that and we can be confident that Jehovah will ultimately bless us

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.639
But never

00:09:12.639 --> 00:09:20.639
May we ever take the viewpoint that we will just put Jehovah to the test by taking chances and doing rash things

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.360
Yes, whatever we make a decision

00:09:23.679 --> 00:09:25.679
Let's stop and prayerfully consider

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:29.440
Is this an act of faith or stupidity
