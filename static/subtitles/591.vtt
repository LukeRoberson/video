00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:08.000
In Proverbs chapter 8, from where our text is taken, wisdom is personified, that is,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.080
it's represented as a person who can speak and act.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.960
And we've always said that this describes Jesus in his pre-human existence, but how could

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.920
you prove that to someone?

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.839
The key is in Proverbs chapter 8 verse 22, let's read it.

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:31.179
It says, Jehovah produced me as the beginning of his way, the earliest of his achievements

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.579
of a long ago.

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.979
Well, we know Jehovah has always existed and has always been wise, neither he nor his

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:46.140
wisdom had a beginning, so wisdom was neither created nor produced, but Jesus, the first

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.340
born of all creation, was produced as the earliest of Jehovah's achievements.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:59.100
And in this chapter, wisdom is said to represent a person who speaks and acts in wisdom.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.899
Note verse 4, the opening quotation marks at the beginning of the verse, the closed quote

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.739
doesn't come until the end of the chapter.

00:01:06.739 --> 00:01:13.340
Let's read verse 4, it says, to you old people, I am calling, I raise my voice to everyone.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.180
Verse 6, listen, for what I say is important, my lips speak what is right.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:26.379
Verse 20, I walk in the path of righteousness in the middle of the pathways of justice.

00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:31.900
This certainly applies to Jesus, who is described in 1 Corinthians 124 as being the wisdom

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.420
of God.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.620
And the Apostle Paul also said at Colossians 2-3 that carefully concealed in Christ or

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.219
all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:48.299
And certainly as God spokesman, the word, Jesus is the perfect expression of Jehovah's

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.299
wisdom.

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:55.379
Additionally, today's text reveals that long ago this wisdom of God, Jesus, worked beside

00:01:55.379 --> 00:01:56.379
Jehovah.

00:01:56.379 --> 00:01:59.060
Let's read all of verse 30.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.659
Then I was beside him as a master worker.

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.180
I was the one he was especially fond of day by day.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.740
I rejoiced before him all the time.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.300
So Jehovah, the creator, worked through his son, the master worker, by means of whom Colossians

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.580
116 says, all other things were created in the heavens and the earth, from the spirit

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.939
creatures in the heavenly realm, to the immense physical universe, to the earth with its

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:33.099
amazing variety of plant and animal life, to the pinnacle of earthly creation humankind.

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:39.539
The comeby my follower book likened this cooperation between Jehovah and Jesus to that of an architect

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:44.500
working with a builder or contractor, who specializes in bringing the architects

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.780
ingenious designs to reality.

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:53.219
Now, unlike what may happen when human architects and builders work on the same project, we can

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:59.139
be sure that Jesus never tried to cut corners or altered Jehovah's designs.

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:04.900
And Jehovah did not micromanage Jesus as he went about executing those designs.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.780
There must have been excellent collaboration between them from the very start of every

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.539
project to sustain their successful working relationship.

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:20.219
Let's consider just one of their wonderful accomplishments, its mention verse 27,

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:26.819
when he, God, prepared the heavens, I, the master worker, was there.

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:32.300
It's very hard for us to comprehend how immense the physical universe really is.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.340
When Albert Einstein published his theory of relativity in 1905, he and many other scientists

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.620
believe that the universe consisted of just one galaxy, our Milky Way, of greatly the

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.180
underestimated the size of the physical universe.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.900
But they still keep trying.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.060
You've heard about the Hubble Space Telescope.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.699
It's about the size of a school bus orbiting 340 miles above Earth, it's been up there

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:00.500
since 1990.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.180
Astronomers aimed it at a patch of sky that seemed to be as empty as possible, no visible

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.580
stars, no nebulas, or galaxies, and they observed it and photographed it.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.860
They picked a small speck of the heavens about the width of what you would see looking

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.259
through a narrow soda straw, and they kept the camera lens open for a total of over 100

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:25.579
hours to collect all the light possible as they photographed that spot.

00:04:25.579 --> 00:04:27.819
And what did they see?

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:36.819
An astonishing assortment of thousands of galaxies in just this one very small sample of the heavens.

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:42.779
These are some of the faintest farthest galaxies ever seen, circular ones, spiral ones,

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:44.259
irregular ones.

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:49.339
No wonder astronomers say there are tens of billions of galaxies in the universe, and

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:55.100
that's just an educated guess, it could be far more.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.699
While we certainly have to be impressed by the great intelligence to both the creator

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:04.740
and his master worker in producing the physical universe.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:10.379
Many of the limitations of humans to understand what has been created all around us, science

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:18.620
writer Bill Bryson wrote, we live in a universe whose age we cannot quite compute, surrounded

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:26.819
by stars whose distances we do not altogether know, filled with matter we cannot identify,

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:34.139
operating in conformance with physical laws whose properties we do not truly understand.

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.899
And yet with beautiful simplicity we open the Bible to the first chapter and read the

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:44.139
first sentence in the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:50.459
And by the second page we read that Jehovah said, let us make man in our image introducing

00:05:50.459 --> 00:05:52.259
his master worker.

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:58.980
How thankful we are that we are not left in the dark about how all of this came to be.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:03.860
Now speaking of the dark, when we look up at the stars, we likely have the same feelings

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:13.540
as did the psalmist David, if you'd like to turn to Psalm 8, Psalm number 8, the first verse,

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.620
O Jehovah our Lord, how majestic your name is throughout the earth.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:22.500
You have set your splendor even higher than the heavens, verse 3.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:27.379
When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared,

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:34.379
what is mortal man that you keep him in mind and a son of man that you take care of him?

00:06:34.459 --> 00:06:39.180
The answer to that question is bound up in Jesus' own feelings about what must have been

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.220
his favorite project.

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:51.060
Back to Proverbs 8, look at verse 31, I rejoiced over his God's habitable earth and I was

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.379
especially fond of the sins of men.

00:06:55.379 --> 00:07:02.379
Remember verse 30 says Jehovah was especially fond of his master worker Jesus, fondness by

00:07:02.459 --> 00:07:05.819
the way is defined as tender affection.

00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:11.660
Now here we're told that Jesus is especially fond of us humans and he's truly interested

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.100
in helping us to get the very best out of life.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:21.180
You can see that from verse 32, and now my sons listen to me, yes, happy are those who

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:29.620
keep my ways, and verse 35, for the one finding me will find life and he receives approval

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.980
from Jehovah.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:39.620
So since Jesus is described as wisdom personified, we must listen to him and accept him as the

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:44.139
one Jehovah has provided for our salvation.

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:50.740
But now how can we show our fondness, our tender affection for God and Christ, for the creator

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.139
and his master worker?

00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:58.500
Well, certainly by doing the work we have been given to do as God's fellow workers and

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.939
as Christ disciples.

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:06.660
Today's text is taken from a watchtower article that is entitled, working together with God,

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.579
a cause for rejoicing.

00:08:09.579 --> 00:08:15.540
And it tells about the building work that brings us the greatest joy and satisfaction

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:16.459
and the reason why.
