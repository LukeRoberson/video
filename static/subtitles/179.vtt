00:00:02.319 --> 00:00:07.320
One of the most underrated qualities in today's world is modesty.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.320
In fact, the world encourages the exact opposite of modesty.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.320
The world says that you are the most important person.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.320
You should promote yourself.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.320
You have no limits.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.320
You have the right to be anything you want to be.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.320
As we'll see, the world's thinking is completely backwards

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.320
and for several reasons.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.320
Really, modesty is a quality that stems from everything that is good.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.320
Our theme scripture for this discussion is Micah 6 and Verse 8.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.320
He has told you what is good and what is Jehovah requiring of you,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:56.320
only to exercise justice, to cherish loyalty and to walk in modesty with your God.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.320
Notice that modesty is one of the key aspects of what is good.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.319
To help us understand why, let's discuss three questions.

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:09.319
What is modesty?

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:12.319
Why do we want to have this quality?

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:14.319
How can we cultivate it?

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:18.319
First, what is modesty?

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:22.319
Basically, it's an awareness of our limitations.

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:27.319
Of course, we often link modesty with appropriate dress and grooming.

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:30.319
But much more is involved.

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:32.319
How do we know?

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:36.319
Consider what we read at Proverbs 11 and verse 2.

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:40.319
When presumptuousness comes, dishonor will follow.

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:44.319
But wisdom is with the modest ones.

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:50.319
Notice that modesty is contrasted with the negative quality, presumptuousness.

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:54.319
A presumptuous person runs ahead without the authority to do so.

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:58.319
He or she ignores proper boundaries and limitations.

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:05.319
That kind of attitude often leads to foolish mistakes, a bad reputation with fellow humans.

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:10.319
And above all, it can cause a person to lose God's favor.

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.319
For example, we might think of King Saul.

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:20.319
Although he started out as a modest young man, in time he became presumptuous.

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:28.319
He even went so far as to offer up a burnt sacrifice, even though he was not authorized to do so.

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:35.319
As a result, Saul lost Jehovah's favor and eventually the kingship.

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.319
In Saul's case, presumptuousness definitely led to dishonor.

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:49.319
On the other hand, a wise and modest person recognizes his limitations and works within them.

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.319
Why is modesty the course of wisdom?

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.319
This brings us to our second main point.

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.319
Why do we want to have this quality?

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:06.319
The foremost reason is that modesty is essential to pleasing our Heavenly Father Jehovah.

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:14.319
Although we don't speak of Jehovah as being modest, even he works within certain limitations that he's imposed on himself.

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:22.319
He teaches us by example how to demonstrate this quality, even though it's not one that he needs to display.

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:28.319
Why can we say that Jehovah imposes limitations on himself?

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.319
Consider just one example.

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.319
He'll never violate the gift of free will that he's granted us.

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:42.319
Jehovah will never force us to serve him, even though, of course, he has the power to do so.

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:51.319
Aren't we grateful that he allows us to serve him because we choose to out of love and not because we are forced to?

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:57.319
Jehovah teaches us to display modesty in other ways as well, for example.

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:06.319
We might think of how he listened patiently as Abraham voiced his concerns about Jehovah's purpose to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah.

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:15.319
Or how Jehovah invited the angels to suggest ways to Fuehaab and then authorized one of their suggestions to be carried out.

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.319
What's the lesson for us?

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:25.319
If Jehovah who doesn't need input or help from anyone patiently listens and delegates,

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:31.319
how much more should we do so, especially since we're all so imperfect and limited?

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:39.319
Are you a family head or an elder in the congregation, or do you have another responsible position in the organization?

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:50.319
If so, you can imitate Jehovah by not micromanaging others, be willing to delegate tasks to them and listen to their suggestions,

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:57.319
imitate Jehovah's example of dignifying others and wanting to help them succeed.

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:03.319
Besides pleasing Jehovah, we have other good reasons to be modest.

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:13.319
Modesty helps us to be joyful, how so, by going hand in hand with a related quality gratitude.

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:19.319
A faithful brother who worked in the writing department for some 50 years was fond of saying,

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:23.319
only a grateful person can be happy.

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:31.319
If we're modestly aware of our limitations, we'll be grateful and happy for the help that we receive from others.

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:37.319
For example, think of the leper who returned to thank Jesus for healing him.

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:40.319
This man realized his limitations.

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:48.319
He was very thankful that Jesus had done something for him that he could never have done on his own.

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:55.319
Another reason to cultivate modesty is that it promotes good relationships with others.

00:05:55.319 --> 00:06:00.319
Let's face it, people aren't usually drawn to those who think,

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:05.319
if I want something done right, I have to do it myself.

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:10.319
But they usually appreciate it when they're shown that we have confidence in them.

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:14.319
This in turn draws them to us.

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:23.319
Another way that modesty promotes good relationships is that it helps us to avoid comparing ourselves to others,

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:29.319
comparing ourselves to others is always a dangerous road to navigate.

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:38.319
Just think, for example, of Jesus' apostles who argued many times over who was the greatest,

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:45.319
or Joseph's brothers, and the terrible things they did because of being jealous of Joseph.

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:51.319
A modest person doesn't obsess over his perceived rank in comparison with others.

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:55.319
In this regard, we can remember the good example of Moses.

00:06:55.319 --> 00:07:03.319
How did he react when Jehovah enabled some of his fellow Israelites to begin acting as prophets alongside him?

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:09.319
Moses rejoiced, saying that he wished all of Jehovah's people were prophets.

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:15.319
Moses didn't feel that he was the only one who should have such a privilege.

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:24.319
Finally, modesty promotes good relationships with others because it prevents us from bragging about our accomplishments

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:30.319
or drawing undue attention to ourselves which could stir up resentment in others.

00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:35.319
So now we know what modesty is and why we want to have it.

00:07:35.319 --> 00:07:38.319
This brings us to our third main point.

00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:42.319
How can we cultivate this beautiful quality?

00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:51.319
One thing we can do is to read and meditate on Bible examples both good and bad, such as those we just discussed.

00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:59.319
Other Bible examples include Daniel, who modestly didn't take credit for the interpretation of King Nebuchadnezzar's dream.

00:07:59.319 --> 00:08:01.319
The lesson for us?

00:08:01.319 --> 00:08:08.319
If we're privileged to have a teaching assignment, or we enjoy a measure of success in the ministry,

00:08:08.319 --> 00:08:11.319
we want to give all the glory to Jehovah.

00:08:11.319 --> 00:08:17.319
We should modestly recognize that we couldn't do these things without his help.

00:08:17.319 --> 00:08:26.319
We can also study the example of Jesus, who didn't even think of trying to grasp for more authority than Jehovah had granted him.

00:08:26.319 --> 00:08:29.319
Philippians 2 and verse 6 tells us,

00:08:30.319 --> 00:08:37.320
He gave no consideration to a seizure, namely that he should be equal to God.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:48.320
Consider how Jesus responded when his disciples James and John approached him with their mother and asked for a privilege that was beyond his authority to grant them.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:57.320
Jesus modestly acknowledged that only Jehovah could decide who would sit at his right and left hand in the kingdom.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.320
Jesus respected his limitations.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.320
What are some other ways we can cultivate modesty?

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:10.320
One is to apply the Bible's counsel founded 1 Corinthians 4 verse 6.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.320
Do not go beyond the things that are written.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.320
This refers primarily to the things written in God's Word.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:25.320
By extension, the principal also applies to the scriptural direction that we receive from our publications.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:34.320
When asked for advice, we would never want to impose our own opinion or simply give an answer off the top of our head.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:42.320
Rather, we want to direct attention to the counsel found in the Bible and Bible-based publications.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:54.320
Another way we can cultivate modesty is by asking for frank comments from a trusted friend as to whether or not we have a reputation for being modest.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:10:04.320
In this regard, we remember the Bible principle as iron sharpens iron so one man sharpens his friend.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:12.320
If someone is willing to offer kind observations about how we can improve, we wouldn't want to bristle at the comments.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:21.320
Granted, it may sting our pride to hear such honest feedback, but don't we all need to hear these things from time to time?

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:26.320
As imperfect humans, each one of us has blind spots as it were.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:30.320
It's hard to see ourselves the way others see us.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:40.320
Remember, we can work to improve our Christian personality, but only if we know the areas that could use some improvement.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.320
We can't change what we don't see.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:48.320
A word of caution. We want to be aware of false modesty.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:55.320
Remember that it's not about simply appearing modest, but actually being modest at heart.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:01.320
To help us examine ourselves, we might meditate on questions like these.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:07.320
When I receive advice or counsel, how do I really feel about it at heart?

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:16.320
Does my internal reaction depend on whether the person giving it has less or more experience or authority than I do?

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:22.320
Am I willing to accept valid suggestions regardless of who offers them?

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:28.320
A final way we can develop true modesty is to ask Jehovah to help us.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:33.320
We know what James 1 verse 17 says.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:42.320
Every good gift and every perfect present is from above, coming down from the father of the celestial lights.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:55.320
Since modesty is one of Jehovah's good gifts to us, we can be sure that if we pray to Jehovah and ask him to help us cultivate this quality, he'll answer our sincere prayers.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:12:02.320
In review, what is modesty? It's a proper recognition of our limitations.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:07.320
Why do we want to have this quality? Because it pleases Jehovah.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:13.320
It promotes good relationships with others, and it adds to our joy.

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:18.320
How can we cultivate modesty? There are many ways.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:25.320
We can meditate on Bible examples both good and bad, and then apply the lessons in our own life.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:30.320
We should apply the counsel to not go beyond the things written.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:42.320
We can ask others for honest feedback on how we're doing and showing this quality, and above all, we can pray to Jehovah and ask him to help us develop it more fully.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:53.320
When we think of all the positive ways that modesty benefits ourselves and others, wouldn't you agree that it truly is a quality that comes from what is good?
