00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:09.189
I never imagined I would be this old in this system of things.

00:00:09.189 --> 00:00:13.189
Time goes by so fast.

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:21.190
I'm on the infirm pioneer list, but it just doesn't feel like enough.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.190
It seemed like yesterday that I had so much youthful energy.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:33.299
I look around and I see the younger ones in the hall.

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:45.079
The congregation is very loving, but I just don't feel I have much to give anymore.

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.079
Others could notice I was feeling down.

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.079
I look at the beauty of our young ones.

00:00:53.079 --> 00:01:05.569
What privileges in Jehovah's service await them?

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:14.579
How I remember the days of my youth?

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:33.299
In decades, I enjoyed the full-time service so much has changed.

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:47.159
In my heart, I still feel young, but my body wars against me.

00:01:47.159 --> 00:02:28.229
I often reminisce about the old days, so many happy memories in Jehovah's service.

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:32.229
One of the elders came by with his wife to encourage me.

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:38.580
He shared Hebrew 610, which reads,

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.580
For God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work,

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.580
and the love you showed for His name.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:52.580
They reminded me how much Jehovah appreciates whatever I can do now.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.580
They both had struggled with similar feelings.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:07.509
We had such a lovely time.

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:12.509
I was encouraged to meditate on the account of the needy widow.

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:18.509
And to imagine the look on Jesus' face when He saw her,

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:38.919
the needy widow gave all that she could out of her want.

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:48.169
But Jesus and Jehovah loved her very much.

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:56.069
I know they love me too.

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:09.479
I can still do so much to encourage others.

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:21.579
The young ones especially need our help.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:45.579
I decided to reach out and encourage them.

00:04:45.579 --> 00:04:49.579
Helping our young ones reach out to serve Jehovah.

00:04:49.579 --> 00:05:13.860
Feels me with such joy.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:24.829
I've been able to encourage others to enjoy and start their life of full-time service.

00:05:24.829 --> 00:05:28.829
How grateful I am to Jehovah.
