00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.549
An artist will use a human model to paint a picture.

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.550
An architect assembles a scaled down model to construct a building.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.550
The reason they use models is to visualize the end result.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.550
And so similarly, to put on the new personality,

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.550
we need a model to visualize what exactly that means.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.550
Now, why is that?

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.550
The watchtower of March 2022 stated,

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.550
the new personality is a way of thinking

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.549
and acting that reflects Jehovah's personality.

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:35.549
So that's the goal.

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:37.549
But because Jehovah is invisible,

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:41.549
he reveals his wonderful personality in human terms

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:43.549
by means of a model.

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:45.549
And that is Jesus.

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:48.549
Successfully putting on the new personality

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:50.549
involves studying the model.

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:53.549
And this is the point made in Ephesians 4.

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:55.549
Perhaps we can turn to that chapter.

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:58.549
The text for today is verse 24,

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:04.549
but actually the process or starting point is verses 20 and 21,

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:06.549
where it says,

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:09.549
but you did not learn the Christ to be like this.

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:12.549
If indeed you heard him and were taught by means of him,

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:16.549
just as truth is in Jesus.

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:21.549
So these verses imply a process of study and instruction,

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.549
just as if we were at school.

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:26.549
We learn, we hear,

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.549
and we are taught by Jesus

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.549
and we're delighted to be taught by Jesus

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.549
because truth is in him.

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.549
Repetition is important in any learning process.

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.549
So hearing Jesus' teachings over and over again

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.549
is essential if we expect to imitate our model.

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.549
Completing a work of art

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:50.549
or a construction project,

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.549
as we know it takes a long time.

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.549
And the reason that putting on the new personality

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.549
takes time is because we have to change a pattern of thinking.

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.549
You see, as imperfect humans,

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.549
we are inclined towards what's physical,

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.550
fleshly and materialistic.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.550
So to counter such tendencies,

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.550
you notice what verse 23 exhorts us to develop.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:16.550
It says,

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.550
and you should continue to be made new

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.550
in your dominant mental attitude.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.550
So we're encouraged to develop a dominant mental attitude.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.550
What exactly does that mean?

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.550
In simple terms, it means to make a determined effort

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.550
to push our thoughts in the right direction.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.550
We learn and we hear Jesus through good study habits,

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.550
but changes require a dominant mental attitude.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.860
Look at this picture for a second. What do you see?

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.860
We say our brother, obviously,

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.860
a very good student, his books are marked.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.860
He's meditating on what he's reading.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.860
And he's allowing the truth to influence him.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.860
You can almost see there in this picture

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.860
that he's making a determined decision

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.860
to do what is right.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.860
The new personality can only take shape

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.860
if Jesus' teachings touch our deepest emotions.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.860
And that's an unhurried process that requires patience.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.860
Now thankfully, Jehovah is patient.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.860
He's patient with all of us,

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.860
giving us a thousand years to reach perfection.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.860
Now, Jehovah's wisdom and patience with people

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.860
as they put on the new personality

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.860
will become evident in an outstanding way

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.860
when the unrighteous ones are resurrected.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.860
And this is the point of discussion in our comments.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.860
The unrighteous include those who had no opportunity

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.860
to know God during their lifetime.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.860
I think for a moment who that may include.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.860
According to the Encyclopedia Britannica,

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.860
it's estimated that eight and a half million soldiers

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.860
from numerous nations died as a result

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.860
of wounds or disease during the First World War.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.860
And the most accepted estimate for deaths

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.860
during the American Civil War

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.860
was estimated at around 620,000.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.860
And that's just a sampling of two wars in history.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:21.860
Now consider how many millions may be resurrected

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.860
whose frame of mind at the time of their death

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.860
was to throw themselves into pitch battle against an enemy.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.860
Now they're resurrected.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.860
And Jesus is tasked with overseeing a grand teaching work

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.860
to help them learn the ways of peace

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.860
and to love their enemies.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.860
How will he do it?

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.860
Isaiah 2, as is 2 to 4,

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.860
beautifully describes an education process

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.860
that has progressive results.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.860
And in fulfillment of that prophecy,

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:52.860
Jesus, it says,

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.860
will set matters straight between nations.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.860
And no more will they learn war.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.860
So while we don't expect resurrected soldiers

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.860
to engage in bloodthirsty wars,

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.860
it's certainly going to take time

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.860
to uproot their prejudices

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.860
that they had during their lifetime.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.860
Now can you imagine if a Japanese kamikaze pilot

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.860
is resurrected?

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.860
How will he feel when he learns that the Emperor

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.860
he sacrificed his life for during World War II

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.860
was in fact not a God after all?

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.860
Or a soldier who learns that the religious leaders

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.860
who encouraged him to go into battle

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.860
will later held accountable by Jehovah

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.860
for the blood of those slaughtered on the earth?

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.860
So we can see why Jehovah will indeed be patient.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.860
As strongly entrenched prejudices are uprooted,

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:53.860
hatreds are removed and replaced by peace and love.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.860
Now such unrighteous resurrected ones

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.860
they too will have to learn about Jesus.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.860
Hear Jesus and be taught by Jesus.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.860
They will have to go back to school.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.860
But the Onus is still on those resurrected ones

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.860
to develop a dominant mental attitude

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.860
by pushing their thoughts in the right direction.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.860
And I'm sure during that time,

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.860
as we see that process taking place

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.860
and the effects of Jesus' teaching,

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.860
that it will be a real joy to behold.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.860
As has been alluded to,

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.860
the video project Good News According to Jesus

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.860
may well play an important role in teaching resurrected ones.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.860
And the reason why is because in the New World

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.860
all will progressively have to become like Christ.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.860
Now when that resurrection work is complete,

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.860
they will reach perfection

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.860
and then they will be the final test.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.860
Now it is quite remarkable when you look at this scene

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.860
that some who put on the new personality

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.860
will actually make a conscious decision to rebel

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.860
and again divide themselves into nations

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.860
at the instigation of Satan.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.860
He's the one that will foster those divisions.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.860
When you look at that picture,

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.860
what you're seeing there is a crowd of people

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.860
who've actually developed a new personality

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.860
maybe over hundreds of years and become like Christ.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.860
And then they choose to rebel.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.860
How sad that is and what a lack of appreciation

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.860
for the education program.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.860
Now interestingly,

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.860
the last question in the final chapter of the pure worship book

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.860
asked how can you prepare now for the final test?

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.860
When we were asked that question,

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.860
we may have thought to ourselves,

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.860
surely our priority is preparing for the great tribulation.

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.860
Maybe we can start thinking about the final test

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.860
seven or eight hundred years from now.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.860
Let's go back to Ephesians chapter four.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:58.860
Verses 26 and 27 offers a reason

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:03.860
why preparing for the final test is good advice.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.860
Verse 26 says,

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:08.860
Be wrathful but do not sin.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:12.860
Do not let the sun set while you are still angry.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.860
And here's the point.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:18.860
Do not give the devil an opportunity.

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:22.860
You see anger that festers gives the devil an opportunity

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:26.860
to influence us to commit a serious sin or maybe worse.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:30.860
By controlling anger we are saying to the devil,

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:35.860
I am not giving you an opportunity to hinder my spiritual progress.

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.860
Now think about the resurrected unrighteous ones.

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.860
They will be able to put on the new personality

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.860
without the devil being around.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:48.860
And that obviously is an advantage in many ways.

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:52.860
However, the final test will be the first time

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:55.860
that they will be exposed to the devil's attempts

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.860
to persuade them to rebel against Jehovah's sovereignty.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.860
So in other words, we have a unique chance

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.860
to prepare for the final test by opposing Satan now

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:08.860
before he's abyssed.

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.860
Now hopefully our experiences of standing up to the devil

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:16.860
will stand us in good stead over a thousand years from now.

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.860
So in summary, allow Jesus to be our model

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:24.860
by learning, hearing and being taught by Him.

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:28.860
This will help us to visualize the end result,

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:32.860
putting on a new personality that reflects Jehovah's way

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.860
of thinking and acting.

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:38.860
So let's all of us allow Jesus and Jehovah

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.860
to produce in us a work of art.
