00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:08.199
It's still chaos in many parts of the city, with armed soldiers detaining and arresting

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:12.640
those not pledging support of the new government.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.589
Are we still going to the meeting tonight?

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:26.940
I wanted to do what was best for my wife and daughter, but a few of the elders have already

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:27.940
been arrested.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:46.880
What if I was arrested?

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.880
What happened to my family?

00:00:47.880 --> 00:01:11.180
You're not going on a prairie are you?

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.780
I pray at my window.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:26.230
Three times a day, every day, if I even appear to compromise, what would they think?

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:33.709
I know Jehovah, and if I trust him, he'll reward me.

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:40.760
I don't know how, but he will.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:49.079
Pray that I keep my faith, that we all keep our faith, no matter how this ends.

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:55.260
The scriptures are clear.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.019
We must continue to meet together, even in small groups, if necessary.

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:08.020
Let's just pray that whatever happens, we have this strength to endure it.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.539
Dear Jehovah, please.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:24.539
Eventually, I was arrested.

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:29.860
We miss you so much, but we're very proud of you.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:38.870
We know whatever the outcome of your trial, you'll maintain your faith, and so will we.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.150
Are you scared?

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:51.909
I was very scared, but Jehovah helps us when we're scared.

00:02:51.909 --> 00:03:08.550
I knew I would be okay, and that Jehovah would take care of my family.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:25.990
It all went by so quickly, pioneering foreign language, circuit work.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.590
There was even a time that I was the one encouraging older ones.

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:36.469
I missed those days so much.

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:44.169
But now, I am the one in a nursing home.

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:55.180
Sometimes, I feel like I have nothing left to offer.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:03.520
O Daniel, you very precious man.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.430
I have been sent to you.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.389
Do not be afraid, Daniel.

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:13.669
Your words have been heard from the first day you gave your heart to understanding.

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:16.430
I have no strength.

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.310
There's breath left to me.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.870
Do not be afraid of very precious man.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.829
May you have peace.

00:04:23.829 --> 00:04:26.819
Be strong.

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:32.930
Be strong.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.329
Happy as the one who keeps an expectation.

00:04:36.329 --> 00:04:37.730
Go on to the end.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:48.170
You will rest, but you will stand up for your life at the end of the days.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:49.689
Just checking on you.

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:50.689
Do you have a minute?

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.930
There is something I've been wanting to share with you.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:05:05.019
Okay, sure.

00:05:05.019 --> 00:05:11.339
Yes, Jehovah does remember me, and I still have much to offer.
