00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:14.820
Hello, I am Victor Annie Barber, and this is Iron Sharpens Iron.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.219
Now, so far in our series, we've discussed how we can become more effective at our ministry

00:00:21.219 --> 00:00:27.820
in a number of different ways, such as by starting conversations, asking questions,

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.820
and getting better at return visits.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:37.820
But these techniques only work if we actually find people to talk to.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.820
And sometimes, that can be our greatest challenge.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:01:00.159
Have you ever had days like this in the ministry when it seemed that there was just no one to talk to?

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:09.159
If so, you'll be pleased to know that our literature is full of tips that can help us contact more people in our territory.

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:15.159
In this episode, we will consider three that have proved to be very effective.

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:20.159
Tip number one, be observance.

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:29.159
There may actually be more opportunities for us to contact people if we actually know where to look.

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.159
Take, for example, our brothers and sisters that we were just watching.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:40.159
Now, it is true that there was no one at home, but does that mean there was no one to talk to?

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.159
Well, let's see.

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.840
Hey!

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.840
You're a dog, you're so cute. What's the same?

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.840
And just like that, a conversation is underway.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:05.719
Now, how about our couple getting back into their car?

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:10.719
By being observant, they too were able to give a witness.

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:15.719
The more observant we are, the more opportunities we may find.

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:24.719
The key is to remain focused on our objective, which is to give a witness.

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:30.719
And that can happen in between doors, just as easily as it could happen at the doors.

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:34.719
So how about our tip number two?

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:37.719
It is be prepared.

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:43.719
How often have you encountered someone in your territory who doesn't speak your language?

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:47.719
You know, growing up in London, this used to happen all the time.

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:53.719
But these days, it's not just big cities where we find this mixture of culture and languages.

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:57.719
The whole world is becoming so much more cosmopolitan.

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:03.719
So what can we do to be prepared?

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:09.719
Well, we don't have the gift of tongues like the 1st century Christians did at Pentecost.

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:15.719
But we do have the gift of J. W. Language.

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:22.719
Now, with this app, you can learn a simple presentation in dozens of different languages.

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:24.719
Let's take a look.

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:28.719
It's designed in a very easy to use manner.

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:33.719
First, set the primary language to the one you speak,

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:41.270
and the target language to the one you want to learn.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:47.270
Then, under preaching skills, choose greetings and introductions.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.270
To learn how to say a simple hello.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.270
And, I'm pleased to meet you.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.270
Do we know each other?

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.270
Do we know each other?

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.270
I think I made a mess of that.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:13.270
Alright, again, Dobryden, Priemno, Posna Jomitisa.

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:19.269
Well, I still need to work on my accents, but I think you get the idea.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:28.269
With a little practice, you can ask simple questions and even introduce and explain a scripture.

00:04:28.269 --> 00:04:30.269
It really works.

00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:32.269
Let's look at an example.

00:04:32.269 --> 00:04:35.269
Hi there, we're making brief visits on our neighbor.

00:04:35.269 --> 00:04:37.269
Oh, Arabic?

00:04:37.269 --> 00:04:38.269
Yes.

00:04:38.269 --> 00:04:39.269
What's your name?

00:04:39.269 --> 00:04:40.269
My name is Abba.

00:04:40.269 --> 00:04:41.269
My name is Abba.

00:04:41.269 --> 00:04:43.269
Did you speak Arabic in Arabic?

00:04:43.269 --> 00:04:44.269
Yes.

00:04:44.269 --> 00:04:45.269
What?

00:04:45.269 --> 00:04:55.269
I've taught you a great way to give a witness to even more in our territory.

00:04:55.269 --> 00:05:01.269
Now, if mastering a whole presentation in another language seems a bit overwhelming,

00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:03.269
then here's a simple suggestion.

00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:05.269
Just learn a greeting.

00:05:05.269 --> 00:05:15.269
It's only a few words, but don't underestimate the power of greeting someone in their native tongue and with a warm smile.

00:05:15.269 --> 00:05:23.269
It can certainly open up doors, and it could also pave the way for you to call back with someone who does speak their language.

00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:27.269
And that brings us on to our third tip.

00:05:27.269 --> 00:05:30.269
Be diligent and follow up.

00:05:30.269 --> 00:05:39.269
Which, first of all, means trying to contact all those who weren't home initially, either on a different day or at a different time.

00:05:39.269 --> 00:05:46.269
And if you can't find them in that way, then don't overlook letter writing and telephone witnessing.

00:05:46.269 --> 00:05:50.269
These methods prove very effective during the pandemic.

00:05:50.269 --> 00:05:55.269
And even now, they can still help us to reach those we can't find at home.

00:05:55.269 --> 00:05:59.269
Regardless of what way we have contacted someone,

00:05:59.269 --> 00:06:08.269
please be sure not to forget them, but return promptly to follow up on any interest that you have found.

00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:13.269
You know, reaching everyone in our territory is definitely a challenge.

00:06:13.269 --> 00:06:26.269
But the tips we've discussed here today, one being observant, two being prepared, and three being diligent as we follow up on interest that we find,

00:06:26.269 --> 00:06:31.269
can help all of us fully accomplish our ministry.

00:06:31.269 --> 00:06:41.269
If we do that, we'll be imitating Jesus, who wanted to give everyone an opportunity to come to know Jehovah.
