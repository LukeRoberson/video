00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:05.839
Worldwide, Jehovah's people are well known as being

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:11.439
law-abiding citizens, persons who pay taxes,

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:15.039
and who do not rebel against the government.

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:17.839
If someone were to ask you what scriptures they're based on,

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:21.920
I'm sure all of us would cite Romans 13, verse 1.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.359
So let's turn that together to refresh our memories.

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:31.120
I want this verse actually tells us Romans 13, verse 1.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.399
Let every person be in subjection to the superior authorities

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:39.280
for there is no authority except by God.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.479
The existing authorities then placed in their relative positions by God.

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:49.840
And then looking at verse 7, it says, render it to all their dues

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.439
to the one who calls for tax, the tax.

00:00:53.439 --> 00:01:00.560
So this is a scrupulous basis for us to pay our taxes and to be law-abiding citizens.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.359
We realize from verse 1 that this involves our faith and belief in Jehovah God

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:10.400
because we realize that the superior authorities are accountable

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.120
not to us but to Jehovah.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.439
So if Jehovah allows certain authorities to remain in control,

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:21.439
then we wait on Jehovah because any abuse of their authority

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:24.640
is answerable to God.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.439
But there could be a challenge in this for us

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.840
because although we may be well known as neutral with regard to politics,

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.519
what else does verse 7 tell us that we need to do?

00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:38.719
We're not as toward the end of verse 7, it says,

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:43.280
to the one who calls for honor such honor.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.519
So not just neutrality, not just submission,

00:01:47.519 --> 00:01:52.079
but being willing to give honor to these individuals who are

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.799
part of the superior authorities.

00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:58.319
Now why can that be a challenge for us?

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:01.760
Well put quite simply, it's easy isn't it

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.680
to honor someone if you don't know what they're up to?

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.520
If you don't know them personally and you don't know their horrible personalities.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.319
Also, if you're not personally affected by decisions that that person makes,

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.960
then again it's a little easier to honor that person.

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:25.520
But today we find ourselves in the midst of a world that has an overload of

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.800
information, the media, TV, radio, they promote the

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.360
personalities of those who are part of the superior authorities.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.919
So we get to know them a little better and perhaps there's also false

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:44.800
information that can be given to us that may form opinions.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.560
Additionally, some of the decisions made by governments do

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.479
personally affect us in many different ways.

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:57.599
So even though we face all of this, what do the Scriptures tell us?

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:03.439
Well we have to show honor such honor to those ones.

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:06.719
Well that may seem a challenge for a Christian,

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:11.599
but first of all we need to remember that the word honor, just like the word love,

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:16.800
can have various meanings in different applications or contexts.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:23.120
For example, loving your enemy is a different feeling to loving your parents.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.560
So in a similar way we need to ask what is this honor?

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.879
The honor mentioned here does not mean admire or imitate or idolize

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.560
or even approve of the conduct of these ones.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:44.719
No, it means giving due respect because of their authority and position.

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:48.560
First Peter chapter 3 verse 15, remember, reminds us

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.479
if we are asked to give a reply as to why we believe a certain way or if there are

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:58.400
issues raised, how should we answer such ones?

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:04.479
What we should do so with a mild temper and deep respect.

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:08.879
So whenever we say something about the superior authorities,

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:14.400
it's good for us to keep in mind the way that we express ourselves.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.000
The Apostle Paul gives a very good example with regard to this.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.680
We remember that Paul was wrongfully imprisoned in Caesarea

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.240
and there he had to wait in detention to try and get justice,

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.759
which he didn't receive there at that time.

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:39.040
So in this process we could say he probably got to know very well

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.439
some of the representatives of the superior authorities.

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:49.600
He also was personally affected by the lack of right decisions.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.639
But how did Paul approach this situation?

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:57.279
How did he express himself before these individuals?

00:04:57.279 --> 00:05:02.879
Well, we noticed first of all, Governor Felix is mentioned as one of the ones

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:07.439
that Paul stood before. What was Felix like?

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:13.199
Well, according to historians, he was a man who really was morally bankrupt.

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:17.519
He felt he could get away with anything, any evil, any lust.

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:20.879
He felt that he wasn't accountable to anyone.

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:26.000
Also, he was able to seduce his wife away from her previous husband.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.040
So as a person, he really wasn't living up to any sort of Christian values whatsoever.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.319
And yet if we look at Acts chapter 24 and verse 10 later, you'll notice

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:44.240
when Paul addresses Felix, he doesn't criticize him for any of these things,

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.839
but he speaks to him in a very respectful manner,

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:50.560
saying that he's very happy to stand before Felix.

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:53.600
Well, what continues on after that?

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:59.040
After waiting such a long time in detention because of false arrest,

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.720
then Paul stands before Governor Festus.

00:06:03.519 --> 00:06:05.519
Now Festus was the worst of providers.

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:10.560
He also was a man who wasn't totally interested in justice.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.639
The scriptures tell us in chapter 25 of Acts verse 7

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:19.120
that he was interested in carrying favor with the Jews.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.199
So he was looking to see what he could do to make the Jews happy

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:26.560
rather than giving true justice to Paul.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.120
So because of this, ultimately Paul appealed to Caesar.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.079
That was his right.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:39.680
But later, after that incident, we'll notice that Festus was interviewing Paul

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.959
and he makes a comment.

00:06:40.959 --> 00:06:42.319
Paul, you're going crazy.

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:43.519
You're going out of your mind.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.720
Now, here, Paul realizing that really Festus couldn't touch him

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.079
because he'd appealed to Caesar.

00:06:50.079 --> 00:06:51.120
He was going there.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.480
That could have been an opportunity for Paul to really tell Festus what he thought about him.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.959
Particularly, Festus was waiting for a bribe and that was totally illegal

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.720
under the Roman arrangement.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.720
But no, Paul very respectfully refers to him as your excellency.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.399
Then Paul stood before King Herod a grip of the second.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.600
Now, he was in the midst of a scandalous and

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.920
senseless relationship with his sister.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.120
He was also morally bankrupt.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.920
And yet again, Paul showed him honor.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.240
Yes, he followed the words there,

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:31.199
recorded in Romans 13, verse 7, he gave honor to those who wanted honor.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.600
This reminds me of an experience that we had many years ago.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.839
It was in a country where Jehovah's Witnesses had been banned for well over 30 years.

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:46.079
And finally, the government registered Jehovah's people.

00:07:46.079 --> 00:07:51.199
So up to that point, in that country, we were not allowed to have kingdom halls or a translation

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:57.759
office. So the branch immediately arranged to purchase some property that we could use for a

00:07:57.759 --> 00:07:59.680
kingdom hall and a translation office.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.800
Well, everything went through except one thing that was needed.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.600
And that was the approval from the government for us to finalize the purchase.

00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:16.560
Well, the brothers hired a worldly lawyer to help us with organizing this.

00:08:17.199 --> 00:08:23.279
And over a period of about 18 months, we saw how the government just played cat and mouse with

00:08:23.279 --> 00:08:29.040
us with regard to this issue. The lawyer would go and see how our application was going.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.159
The government would say, oh, no, we don't have any application at all.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.360
And then the lawyer would show the copies of the application and suddenly they would find our

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:43.759
application. Well, after this long period of time, this worldly lawyer rang the branch committee.

00:08:43.759 --> 00:08:50.559
He called them and he said, we have got them. Now is your opportunity to embarrass the government.

00:08:50.559 --> 00:08:53.600
I've got this file of all the things that they've done.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:09:00.080
If we release this to the media, we can embarrass the government totally and force them to

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:04.159
approve this purchase. Well, how would you have answered?

00:09:05.519 --> 00:09:12.720
Well, the answer given to the worldly lawyer was, Jehovah's Witnesses are not interested in embarrassing

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:19.200
governments. We don't get involved with protests and riots. All we want is a piece of land

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:25.039
where we can build a kingdom hall. So we asked the lawyer to respectfully ask the government,

00:09:25.039 --> 00:09:30.559
what could we do to solve this problem? And the answer came back. They didn't want us to have

00:09:30.559 --> 00:09:35.279
that particular piece of land because it was too prominent. They were happy for us to have

00:09:35.279 --> 00:09:39.600
another piece of land. And a kingdom hall, translation office and missionary home,

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:45.679
were eventually built on that land. But was there any benefit to that? Yes, as it turned out,

00:09:45.679 --> 00:09:52.960
a worldly lawyer eventually gave up his legal practice and went into politics and became one of

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:59.120
the most prominent government officials as a minister in the government. After being appointed

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.600
as such, he called the branch and he said to the brothers and the branch committee,

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:11.039
I will never forget your answer that you gave me. You do not want to embarrass the government.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.519
So the government would like to tell you that you can double the number of

00:10:15.519 --> 00:10:21.759
missionaries that you have now in this country. And ever since that time, our brothers have enjoyed

00:10:21.759 --> 00:10:28.320
decades of peaceful relationships with the government. So what's the point? Jehovah's people

00:10:28.639 --> 00:10:36.000
interested in rioting and protesting, but we do what Romans 13 verse 7 says. When honor is

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:45.679
called for, we give honor to the superior authorities.
