00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:09.990
I often put it off until later, so I come home in the evening tired and like to relax.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.990
We're very often I was tired for many different reasons, and that is why I didn't have the

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.989
motivation even to start by reading in the first place.

00:00:16.989 --> 00:00:22.989
I also had many phases where it was really tough to stick it out with Bible reading.

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:26.989
Especially in the age of social media, there are many other things you can fill your day

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:29.989
with.

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:32.990
One hobby that mainly got in the way was watching movies.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.990
I really spent a lot of time on that.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.990
This often seals precious time you could have made better use of.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.990
So something that moved me was the thought that through Bible reading,

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.990
you're actually talking to Jehovah.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.990
That you pray to him and he is the nuts ring you through the Bible.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.990
As Jehovah promised that he can give us both the power and the desire to act,

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.990
I just pray to Jehovah to please first give me the power to read,

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.990
and then the desire follows.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.989
Then I decided to simply start and stick with it.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.989
I started with reading my favourite book, and that way it was easier for me.

00:01:09.989 --> 00:01:14.989
Well, I started with Genesis just to get through the whole Bible.

00:01:14.989 --> 00:01:20.989
My favourite Bible book is Esther, and because I think she was a very special person,

00:01:20.989 --> 00:01:25.989
it was especially then that I could imagine what her situation was like,

00:01:25.989 --> 00:01:30.989
and what kind of a person she was, and I could see myself in the account.

00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:34.989
The weekly Bible reading programme has been such a guideline.

00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:37.989
It's motivating since we discussed this content at the meetings,

00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:40.989
and I could use the study aids in our workbook too.

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:43.989
You can better relate to the brothers and sisters' comments

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:47.989
because you've read the material yourself, and I can comment too.

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:51.989
When I'm meeting the Bible in the JW Library app on my phone,

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:55.989
there's of course the risk that it vibrates and I get a message,

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:59.989
and then of course you have the urge to check to see who just wrote me.

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:03.989
For me, personally then, it's really helpful when I put my phone in airplane mode

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:08.990
so that I can really focus on what I'm reading and nothing can distract me.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.780
I like reading at home, but I also like to do outdoors

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.780
because I think that's where you're closest to Jehovah.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.780
I never just read about the events that are described in the Bible,

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.780
but I ask myself questions like, why did Jehovah have this written down?

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.780
What is in there for me personally?

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.780
And this helps me to stay focused and not just scratch the surface,

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.780
otherwise my mind would immediately start wondering.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.780
At a convention, I learned something that helps me to really take in the things I read.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.780
The point discussed was to remember to look in four different directions

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.780
when meditating, so to speak.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.780
First, to look upwards to find out exactly what I am learning from the text about Jehovah,

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.780
then downwards to find out what it teaches me about his purpose,

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.780
about what he wants for the earth,

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.780
then to look at myself, how I can personally benefit now,

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.780
and eventually towards others thinking about how I can help other people

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.780
with this particular Bible text.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.780
In the JW Library app, there are four different colours for highlighting text,

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.780
so I simply use a different colour for each of the four directions

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.780
and highlight them on my tablet or smartphone.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.250
For example, one of my hobbies is drawing.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.250
I decided one time that I was going to draw the spiritual suit of armor,

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.250
all of its different parts and their symbolic meanings,

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.250
and this especially helped me to actually see the benefit of it

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.250
to see how many wonderful resources Jehovah provides us with

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.250
and that he never leaves us alone.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.250
Another thing I like very much is the category Bible Study Activities,

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.250
where you can directly pick a topic that you personally find interesting and then to read that.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.250
It's Jehovah's word, I love him, and also want to play some, of course.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.250
That's why it's very important to understand his word.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.250
It feels really good when you've understood a difficult phrase by doing it this way.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.250
It actually makes you feel like you've achieved something,

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.250
and this brings you a lot closer to Jehovah.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.250
It happens often that you don't even know what you should pray about

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.250
or what you could thank Jehovah for.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.250
My personal Bible reading has helped me with this a lot,

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.250
because now I know exactly what I want to tell Jehovah.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.250
Daily Bible reading is very important to me,

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.250
as it gives me some sort of inner balance when I face situations

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.250
that might be unfamiliar or shape me up.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.250
I know that no matter what the problem is,

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.750
Jehovah has always the right answer prepared.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.750
At the beginning, it is really hard.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.750
You have to fight to keep it up, then you definitely need discipline.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.750
After a while, you truly start to enjoy it,

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.750
and it gets easier and easier,

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.750
and you're happy that you started in the first place.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.750
I really think that when Jehovah sees how much effort you put into it

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.750
that he's genuinely proud of you,

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.750
and that's the best thing that can happen to you.
