00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:07.330
At Romans 8 and verse 35, the Apostle Paul asked,

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.830
Who will separate us from the love of the Christ?

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:21.030
Will tribulation or distress or persecution or hunger or nakedness or danger or sword?

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.530
Notice how Paul answered that question in verse 37.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:35.530
On the contrary, in all these things, we are coming off completely victorious through the one who loved us.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.530
That's a very fitting scripture for this update.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.530
Many of the things Paul mentioned, we've experienced in the past year.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.530
There have been many challenges.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:55.530
Yet through the help we receive from Jehovah, we are coming off victorious.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.530
Of course, we're all contending with the pandemic.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:06.530
Jehovah's organization has been complying with guidance from public health officials worldwide.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.530
We've worked hard as an organization to show deep respect for the sanctity of life.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.530
And we've watched Jehovah bless these efforts as our meetings and ministry have thrived.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.530
However, we are not immune to the effects of the virus.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:38.530
As of May 15, we have now lost over 17,000 of our dear brothers and sisters to COVID-19.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.530
No doubt most of us have lost someone we love.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.530
How comforting to know that our loved ones are safe in Jehovah's memory.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.530
Even death has not separated them from Jehovah.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:03.530
There have been many recent news reports about the pandemic in India and Brazil.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.530
Many of you have been asking how our brothers there are doing.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:20.530
In the past month, in India, there have been 10 times as many new cases and deaths among the brothers than there were in the previous month.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:32.530
The disaster relief committees are actively monitoring the needs of our brothers and, as needed, helping them locate hospitals that have available beds.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.530
In Brazil, the number of cases and the number of deaths continue to be high.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:47.530
Sadly, over 400 of our brothers in Brazil have died from the virus in just the past month.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.530
The responsible brothers are working hard to help our brothers in these lands.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:01.530
Please keep all of our brothers in India and Brazil in your prayers.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.530
In various parts of the world, the virus is resurging.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:12.530
In some cases because of new variants. Clearly, this pandemic is not over.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.530
Please continue to be careful.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.530
You may find it helpful to review the 2020 governing body update number 9,

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:30.530
which explains how COVID-19 spreads and what we can do to protect ourselves.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.530
What is our view on vaccination?

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.530
Jehovah's Witnesses are not against vaccination.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.530
We view it as a personal decision for each Christian to make.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:53.530
Already, in cooperation with public health officials, many in our Bethel families have chosen to be vaccinated.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:01.810
In 2020, we also faced an unprecedented number of natural disasters.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:09.810
Now, can you imagine? In the 2020 service year, we had 204 disasters.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:16.810
That's more than double the number of disasters that we had in 2018.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.810
Of course, we've had to cope with many disasters during the pandemic.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.810
Let me remind you of some of them.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.810
Central America was struck by Hurricane Edda.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.810
St. Vincent has had volcanic eruptions.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.810
Croatia was shaken by earthquakes.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.810
Lebanon was devastated by an explosion.

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.810
Nigeria suffered widespread flooding.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.810
Mozambique was hit by cyclone Eloise.

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.810
The Philippines was pummeled by super typhoon Goni.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.810
Australia had destructive bushfires.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.810
These are just a few of the disasters we have faced during the pandemic.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:15.810
This is exactly what Paul was talking about when he mentioned tribulation, distress, hunger, nakedness, danger, or sword.

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:21.810
Would any of these things be able to separate us from God's love?

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.810
What have we seen?

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.810
Let's hear some expressions from our brothers in the United States.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:45.180
When you have a disaster on top of a disaster, COVID-19 on top of Hurricane Sally, it's a challenge to get through and navigate both.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:52.180
Being homebound for so many months, everybody was already feeling a little bit on edge.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.180
Then you had the stress of the flood on top of it.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:03.180
The speed of the brothers and sisters responding was probably from the most heartwarming.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.180
We called them on a Wednesday to start some of their work on Friday.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.180
And by Friday, they were organized and ready to go.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:20.180
I think it's one of those heartwarming privileges I've ever had to see how that Jehovah's organization can take care of needs for us.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:25.610
The world around us is falling apart.

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.610
People we think I can handle this, I can handle this.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.610
You know, I can do this, and you can't go it on your own.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.610
You need the friends, you need them.

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.610
When the call goes out, Jehovah's people come running.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.610
It's an amazing thing to see.

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.610
There's no way that Jehovah's love can be blocked.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:48.610
If you're sheltered in place or wherever you are, Jehovah's love gets through.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.610
We've been through a difficult situation, but our confidence is solid.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:59.610
That he'll continue to help us. He got us through this problem. He'll get us through the next.

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:06.610
One of the reasons why our brothers are coming off victorious is because of all of you.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.610
You've been there to help.

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.610
Some of you have risked your own safety to provide relief.

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:19.610
Although most of us don't have the circumstances to do that, we've made donations.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:33.610
As a result, we've been able to provide our brothers with food, water, building materials, and medicine, all because of your generosity and goodness.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:41.610
Thank you for what you've done to help our brothers who face these disasters.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:47.610
That's not the only thing that Paul talked about in Romans 8 and verse 35.

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.610
He also mentioned persecution.

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:56.610
We certainly have had to face that. It hasn't gone away during the pandemic.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:05.610
As of May 2021, more than 155 brothers and sisters are in prison for their faith.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:10.610
Even so, there have been positive developments.

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:20.610
In recent months, we were so encouraged to learn that 32 of our brothers in Eritrea have been set free,

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:28.610
including Paulus, Isaac, and Nguede who were in prison for 26 years.

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:35.610
We continue to pray for the 20 brothers and sisters who are still in prison.

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:49.610
On May 8, we were delighted to learn that the Turkmenistan government released from prison all 16 of our brothers who were in prison for conscientious objection to military service.

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:55.610
We thank Jehovah for these positive developments.

00:08:55.610 --> 00:09:10.610
When I went to Russia for the Supreme Court hearings in 2017, it was a very sobering moment when we heard the judge announce that our legal entities were banned.

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:20.610
We knew Jehovah would look after our brothers, but there were so many unknowns. How would our brothers be affected?

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:24.610
Some, of course, have been arrested, like Brother Dennis Christensen.

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:31.610
He's been in prison for four years as of May 25, 2021.

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:38.610
Although Dennis has qualified for parole for over a year, the authorities have hardened their hearts.

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:48.610
They have not let him go. In spite of that, Dennis and his wife Arena are in good spirits.

00:09:48.610 --> 00:10:01.610
And we continue to remember our 10 brothers who are in penal colonies in Russia and the 48 who are in pretrial detention as of May 14, 2021.

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:08.610
Now that four years have passed since the ban, what do we say?

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:29.379
Our brothers have not coward. They have not backed down. They continue to serve Jehovah faithfully. As you watch this next video, see who the authorities are attacking now.

00:10:29.379 --> 00:10:39.379
In 2013, our son Igor became ill and he got worse and worse. Then in 2014, our son died.

00:10:39.379 --> 00:10:46.379
It was such a tragedy for us and words cannot describe it. He was our only son and was deeply loved.

00:10:46.379 --> 00:10:57.379
Then, two years later, my mother died and two years after that, my sister died, getting through all of that was beyond human strength.

00:10:59.379 --> 00:11:14.269
We had just started to feel a little better. When on March 26, 2019, our men in masks burst into our home.

00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:21.269
It was such a shock we went now. We couldn't say anything. We were paralyzed.

00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:31.269
On May 22, 2019, early in the morning at 5.45, the doorbell rang.

00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:37.269
I looked through the people and saw people who showed me their identification.

00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:45.269
Then those people came into my apartment, made a search and took me to the center for fighting extremism.

00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:51.269
It turned it up with my being accused of participating in extremist activity.

00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:58.269
Then, in 2020, the court hearings began for my case.

00:11:58.269 --> 00:12:07.269
For example, for my criminal case, they collected 17 volumes of evidence against me and they questioned over 200 witnesses.

00:12:07.269 --> 00:12:13.269
Then, the court hearings started. First of all, there were Valentinas hearings, then mine.

00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:21.269
Of course, none of that is exactly pleasant, but it somehow made us stronger and Jehovah supported us.

00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:29.269
We even went to the court feeling joyful. We felt that Jehovah was helping us, supporting us, strengthening us and encouraging us.

00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:31.269
We are so grateful to Him.

00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:36.269
Our fellow worshippers constantly called on us from all parts of the town.

00:12:36.269 --> 00:12:45.269
They always supported us, always called us and said strengthening things and quotes from the Bible.

00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:50.269
I understood that it would end up with my being a defendant.

00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:57.269
It was as though inside I was already prepared for that and you know I didn't feel any kind of panic.

00:12:57.269 --> 00:13:03.269
I just wanted to get through it in a dignified manner and didn't want to let anyone down.

00:13:03.269 --> 00:13:08.269
And under no circumstances, betrayal got Jehovah.

00:13:08.269 --> 00:13:14.269
I want to say that each day for me is a blessing from Jehovah.

00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:20.269
I pray and ask for peace and calmness in both my heart and my home.

00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:27.269
And right now, the blessings far outweigh all negative experiences.

00:13:27.269 --> 00:13:36.269
This I value very highly. The sentence might even involve time and prison, or it might be a suspended sentence.

00:13:36.269 --> 00:13:44.269
But regardless of the outcome, we need to remain faithful to God and to stay on the way of truth to the end.

00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:52.269
No matter what happens, whether I remain free or they put me somewhere behind prison walls,

00:13:52.269 --> 00:13:58.269
there is absolutely nothing that can separate us from God's love.

00:13:58.269 --> 00:14:07.269
No prison walls can shut out God's love. It can penetrate everywhere to all depths.

00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:13.269
It was the strength that we received from God that helped us to survive the death of our son

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:19.269
and many other misfortunes. So we will get through this too, but definitely will.

00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:21.269
I have no doubt about it.

00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:33.230
How shameful that the authorities are attacking our elderly brothers and sisters.

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:43.230
And yet, isn't it amazing that despite their own trials, these dear older ones are not yielding to fear?

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:50.230
They say that the persecution has only made them stronger in the faith.

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:56.230
You dear brothers and sisters in Russia have done so well.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:15:04.700
You are an inspiration to all of us. We truly love you.

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:12.700
Doesn't all of this convince us of what Paul said in Romans 8 and verse 37?

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:20.700
In all these things, we are coming off completely victorious through the one who loved us.

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:28.700
That's what we've seen with our brothers and sisters facing the pandemic, natural disasters and persecution.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.700
What conviction does this lead us to?

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:37.700
Paul continues in verses 38 and 39.

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:48.700
For I am convinced that neither death nor life nor angels nor governments nor things now here nor things to come,

00:15:48.700 --> 00:16:01.700
nor powers nor height nor depth nor any other creation will be able to separate us from God's love that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:14.700
Brothers and sisters, we are convinced that you too will continue to come off completely victorious no matter what trials you face.

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:22.700
Why? Because nothing can separate us from Jehovah's love.

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:28.700
Please know that we love you all very much.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:34.700
