00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:15.500
In the mid-1970s, several brothers from the Montreal area were approached to help with a unique situation that was unfolding.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:25.500
A special pioneer, who was taking the lead at the time, said that about a thousand people, all from the same church, wanted to study the Bible with Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:33.390
And it was all because of an informal witness. The story began this way.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.390
A brother in the local congregation approached me one day to tell me about an experience he had with one of his workmates.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:47.390
This man was responsible for a small local church, and the brother had been able to give him an informal witness.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:57.390
The man indicated that he would like a Bible study, and he wanted to convince the other members of his church to also study the Bible with Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.390
The fact was, this person had a certain influence in the church.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.390
So he talked to the church members about the message he had heard from the brother.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.390
And he convinced them that what they were missing was a better understanding of the Bible.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.390
Many people heard about it because it was an exceptional event.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.390
From what I heard, there was around a thousand people who wanted to study the Bible at that time.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.390
We didn't have the brothers and sisters that were needed to conduct all these Bible studies.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.390
So they formed groups of ten, twelve, fifteen people.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.390
And once or twice a week in King of Halls, they conducted Bible studies.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.390
It was questions, questions. Everyone was asking questions.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:52.560
But the Bible could always answer all these questions in a logical way.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.560
One verse would explain another, and we came to see that the Bible in its entirety could explain every subject.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:06.799
At the beginning, groups of two or three family studied together.

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.800
And yeah, they answered with the Bible.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.800
That amazed me because I didn't know the Bible at all.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.800
But I thought the Bible talks about this, the Bible talks about that. It was like a discovery for me.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.800
That was the parents. The children weren't there, so when we accepted it, then we teach it to our children.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.300
Everyone was disciplined, sitting at the table.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.300
The children were very quiet with their truthbook in front of them and their Bible.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:45.300
When these families came to the Kingdom Hall, the children were sitting beside their parents, not moving, paying attention to what was being said.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.300
I was young when they started coming. I remember it very well. A lot of them were my age.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.300
I saw them like future potential friends. It was really touching.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.300
The first meeting I attended was here in Laval.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:08.550
It really contributed to me one day taking a stand.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.550
And Jehovah becoming my God and the truth becoming my way of life.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:22.849
When I was young, I was very afraid of death.

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:29.849
It was such a relief to learn that we don't suffer when we die. It's like a sleep.

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:36.849
The ambitions I had before that may have been attainable became second place.

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:44.849
Now it was to have a simple life, to walk with the organization, and to raise my children in the truth.

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:49.849
Today these brothers are really doing a lot in the organization, helping in different areas,

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.849
sheltering great responsibilities.

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.849
My father always strived to set the example for all his children.

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:02.849
And it made an impression on me. Now my wife and I have the privilege of serving here at the Canada branch.

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.849
I was eight years old when my family started attending meetings.

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:13.849
I have really good memories of how the local congregation at the time took care of us and looked after us.

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:18.850
At the age of 15, I started reading my Bible every day and studying it too.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.850
From that point on, I knew what I wanted to do with my life.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.850
Serve Jehovah full time.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:33.569
I really think Jehovah could see us on the inside.

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:39.740
Jehovah helped us a lot.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:46.959
You can't have anything better than that.

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:50.959
On our own, we never would have got out of that situation.

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:56.850
But Jehovah found a way to find rightly disposed ones.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:02.850
A simple informal witness led to Bible studies that touched so many.
