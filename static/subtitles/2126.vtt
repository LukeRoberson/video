00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:14.109
So I'm sitting in a business class and all of a sudden the subject of evolution comes up.

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:18.670
When my teacher asked me why, to give the reason why I don't believe in evolution, I remember

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.789
all I could say was just because I'm one of Jov's witnesses and that's my belief.

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.469
Many students actually believe, like they seem so sure that evolution is a fact.

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:36.750
My life could feel my hands getting, or like my palms getting sweaty and just nervous.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.750
I felt intimidated.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.109
I just sat there.

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:43.670
I felt paralyzed and I couldn't defend the truth.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.909
Why can't I explain this?

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:47.750
I could explain why I don't sleep the flag so easily.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.909
Why I don't celebrate birthday so easily?

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:52.670
I didn't understand why I couldn't explain this.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.030
Specific topic.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:02.909
I had doubts and I was asking myself questions like, does God really exist?

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:05.310
Is the Bible accurate?

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.989
So that day after I came home from school, I went to my mom and I asked her, you know,

00:01:09.989 --> 00:01:14.870
this is what happened at school and I need answers.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:22.030
I feel like I don't know what to do, especially since my parents were not serving Jehovah.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.349
So I had to pray to Jehovah to help me.

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:32.349
So she sat me down at the computer, we went to JW.org and then in the search box, my mom

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:36.870
told me to type in anything that was the problem, what I had questions on.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.989
So we typed in evolution, that's when I clicked on the origin of life brochure.

00:01:41.989 --> 00:01:47.709
It just started like coming in, like everything started clicking as if like, you know, there's

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:49.510
a light bulb that went off.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:56.069
So in one of the videos and the viewpoints on this origin of life section, it talked

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:03.390
about the brain and how the brain is so complex that billions and billions of neurons are connected

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.390
to one another.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:11.189
It amazed me so much that how because of the brain, we can move our hands, we can move

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:16.750
our feet, we can do facial expressions, we can do so many things because of this great

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.509
part of the body, the brain.

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:25.150
It was, you know, the exact questions that I was having trouble understanding.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.550
And each question, I, like, I was like, oh, I remember reading this in, you know, one

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.789
of the watchtowers with the books I was studying.

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:37.590
But it broke it down into ways that, you know, in words that are simple for me to understand

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.590
at that point.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.189
So it was almost, you know, it felt like Jehovah was talking to me through this brochure

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:47.629
and it just, it felt, I was like, this is what I need to read.

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.990
And that's what helped me get through it.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:57.110
So I thought to myself, this couldn't have been made just by chance, it couldn't just

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.590
exist by an accident, it had to be created, it had to be designed.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.550
So I was able to go back and I went to my size class and I told my teacher, I was like,

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.669
I'm ready to explain why.

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:16.669
So here we go again, it's physics class, it's the same topic all over it.

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:18.669
But this time it was different.

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:22.110
I was able to defend my faith in Jehovah.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.750
I realized that, you know, Jehovah always provides the answers to any topic, anything, I

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.590
just have to be willing to go and find it.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.030
Whenever I have questions about anything, I look for the answers.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.949
But first, I pray that Jehovah, and Jehovah has made it so easy for us to find the truth.

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:45.590
I'm totally convinced that whatever he says in the Bible, we can completely trust

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:46.590
him.
