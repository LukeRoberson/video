00:00:00.660 --> 00:01:24.349
Everything okay?

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:29.680
It's Ben.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.060
He's been ignoring me.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.060
What did I do?

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:43.859
Maybe you didn't do anything.

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:45.859
Everything...

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:47.859
He may be dealing with something.

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:52.560
You know, he may need a friend.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.560
More than ever.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.560
Even if it doesn't seem like it.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.769
Take a look at Proverbs 17-17.

00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:08.680
A true friend shows love at all times.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.240
At all times.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:36.169
A true friend is a brother born for times of distress.

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:42.169
And shows patience when it's hard to understand a friend's actions.

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:48.960
It can be easier to make a friend than to keep a friend.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.960
That takes patience and time.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:03:01.740
Hey, hey.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:02.740
Good to see you.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.020
Hey, listen.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.020
I really wanted to say...

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.020
Thank you.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.919
Don't even worry about it.

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:17.919
Ready to play?

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:18.919
Ready.
