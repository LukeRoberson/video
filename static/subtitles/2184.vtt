00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:17.820
From June 2014 through January 2015, Joe was witnesses held international conventions

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.579
around the world.

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:24.940
One of these events took place at the National Sports Stadium in Harari, Zimbabwe from

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.379
August 22nd through the 24th, 2014.

00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:35.020
Joining us in studio at the Watch Your Educational Center in New York is John Jubber, a representative

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.500
of the branch office of Joe was witnesses in Zimbabwe.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.700
He is currently here receiving additional training in organizing the Bible Educational

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.140
Work of the Witnesses in Zimbabwe.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.619
Thank you so much for joining us and being with us today.

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:51.100
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.859
Tell us about the International Convention.

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:55.700
Where were the delegates from?

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:05.659
We had 3,500 delegates that were from Brazil, Germany, United States, Zambia and Kenya.

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:11.219
How would you describe the impact of the International Convention there in Zimbabwe?

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:16.700
Well I think it would be fair to say that this international convention really put

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.700
Jehovah's Witnesses on the map in Zimbabwe.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.099
Many people of course knew about us before, but now with all these delegates coming and

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:31.140
then a huge crowd coming for the actual convention that was held at the National Sports Stadium,

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.700
people became very much aware of the activities and of the work of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.340
What was the attendance of the International Convention?

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.180
Well it started out on the first day with over 60,000 which was a big surprise to us because

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:52.299
the stadium can only take 60,000 people and we only have 43,000 witnesses in the country.

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:57.500
So we thought we may have perhaps more than 50,000 on the peak day which would be Sunday,

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:04.299
but we started with over 60,000 and ended up with 82,409 on the Sunday which was the peak

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:05.299
attendance.

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.540
That is a phenomenal response.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.900
What do you think were contributing factors to that response from the public to the convention?

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.860
There were a few factors, but one of them was the fact that the delegates from other countries

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.500
came and shared actively and talking about the convention that was coming up.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.099
So they were mostly in the country for a few days ahead of time.

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.620
They spoke about it enthusiastically.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.020
That was one factor.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:38.020
Another was the fact that the witnesses ahead of time arranged a campaign to advertise

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.979
the convention, to invite people to come.

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:44.020
And another factor was the publicity that was given it in the media.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.099
So all of these factors together made sure that many people knew about the convention and

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.060
many interested people came.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.060
Really interesting.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:59.939
Contributed to the interest that the news media and the public had in the convention activities.

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:02.300
Well, maybe one thing is that it was good news.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.419
You know, we don't get a lot of good news these days, but this was something which was

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:07.300
just very positive.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:13.860
It was an influx of people for a good purpose and it really helped people to see that Jehovah's

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:20.580
Witnesses are there to promote their Bible education work, but at the same time to promote

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.939
the interests of the community and to really try to help people to benefit from what the

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:26.939
Bible teaches.

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:30.099
And so as a result of that, it was all very, very positive.

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:31.939
That's excellent.

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:37.340
Has the branch office since the Bible hosted an international convention before?

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.020
Not an international convention.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.419
Of course, we've had our annual regional conventions which have been held for many, many years, but

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:47.939
never anything of this magnitude or scope.

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:53.219
So as you look back and you've been in Zimbabwe for some time now, how would you rank this

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:59.819
event in terms of its impact on the local communities in Harari as well as the entire

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.379
country of Zimbabwe?

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:04.819
There's no doubt that this was historic.

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.860
This was something which everybody will remember.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.939
It was something that witnesses will remember and even non-witnesses because Harari was

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:15.620
impacted in a way like never before.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:21.699
So certainly, it has been an event that has been very historic and we know that many people

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:24.100
benefited very much from it and going forward.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.699
The results are going to also just be positive for all concerned.

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:29.019
That is excellent.

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:35.660
One of the government officials that you mentioned Walter and Zimbabwe, who is the Minister

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.660
of Tourism and Hospitality Industry for the Republic of Zimbabwe.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.899
He came to New York a couple of weeks after the International Convention in Zimbabwe and

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:49.660
part of his business trip, he made a special visit to the World Headquarters of Zimbabwe

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.660
Witnesses.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.420
In his words, specifically to thank Zimbabwe Witnesses for choosing Harari as one of the locations

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.660
for the International Convention programs.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.779
What else are you hearing from other officials in the country about the impact of the International

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:04.779
Convention?

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:08.620
All around, it seems the impact was very positive.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.660
The officials were very helpful for us and of course the question on their minds is, when

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.300
will the next one be?

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.100
So although we may not have an international convention like that lined up in the near future,

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.259
they are all very keen to be of assistance to us.

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:29.579
So a fun spirit of cooperation and a willingness to work along with us was very evident from

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:32.019
early days and continues up to today.

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:36.060
So we are confident that in the future we will continue to enjoy this good relationship

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.939
with authorities both government and in the private sector.

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:40.939
Very good.

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:47.540
Looking at the future and looking ahead, how do you hope to sustain the public's interests

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.579
and the witness's activity and the bi-education work in Zimbabwe, particularly in view of

00:05:52.579 --> 00:05:56.939
the tremendous response to the International Convention in Harari?

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:58.939
Well there has been an outstanding response.

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:04.899
Many, many people have sent in their names to the local branch office, asking for certain

00:06:04.899 --> 00:06:10.899
items of literature, asking to be visited, asking to have Bible studies conducted

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:12.180
with them.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:17.980
And we are sure that this is going to be sustained, that as these people get more help, so they

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:23.339
will see how the Bible really can benefit them now and can give them a wonderful hope

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:27.459
for the future, which is something that people really look forward to and need in this day

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:28.459
and age.

00:06:28.459 --> 00:06:29.459
Excellent.

00:06:29.459 --> 00:06:33.740
John Jover, representative of the branch office of Joe's Witnesses in Zimbabwe, thank

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:38.459
you very much for taking time out of your schedule to talk with us and share these

00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:43.740
comments and insights, we wish you continued success in all the work that you are doing

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:44.740
there in Zimbabwe.

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.060
Thank you very much.
