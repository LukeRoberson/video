WEBVTT

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:07.620
Served Jehovah with rejoicing, says Psalm 100 verse 2.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.119
Yes, Jehovah wants us to be joyful,

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:14.359
and he's given us many reasons to rejoice.

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:17.660
He gave us life with his many joys.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.960
He gave us the Bible to teach us how to enjoy life,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.000
and he guides us into countless joyful experiences.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.100
Yes, Jehovah is the God who gives joy.

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:36.140
Satan, however, does not want us to find joy in serving Jehovah.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.859
Why not?

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:42.340
For one thing, he knows that joy helps us to keep on preaching

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.100
and teaching the very work he wants to stop,

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.020
so he tries to destroy our joy.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.780
Sometimes, through official opposition,

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.820
and at other times, through family and community pressure.

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:01.420
Satan also wants us to cut back our service to Jehovah

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.260
in order to obtain unnecessary material things.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.579
He wants us to think that getting more and more material things

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:12.900
will bring us lasting joy.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.900
He had won't.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.739
Satan's tactics are not new.

00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:20.980
As we now read portions of the books of Ezra, Haguey,

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.900
and Zachariah, look for lessons that can help us

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.900
to serve Jehovah with rejoicing today.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.219
Note what brought Jehovah's people joy back then

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:37.540
and what robbed them of their joy,

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.219
and consider why and how we can experience the joy

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:47.219
of Jehovah today, even under trying circumstances.

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:58.989
Ezra, a priest and a copious of the law of Moses,

00:01:58.989 --> 00:02:01.989
is the writer of the book that bears his name.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.510
The book of Ezra picks up the history of Israel

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.870
from the end of Second Chronicles,

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.870
which likely Ezra also wrote.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.110
His 537 BCE, and many Jews are about to return to Judah.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.469
The nation has spent 70 years in captivity to Babylon

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:23.189
for practicing idol worship.

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:26.909
They've learned a hard lesson,

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:31.909
and never again does the entire nation fall back into idolatry.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.150
Now, the time has come to get pure worship back

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.270
on its feet in Jerusalem.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.550
The account spans the range of several Persian kings,

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.509
starting with King Cyrus,

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:50.389
and it has a joyful beginning.

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:53.069
Please open to Ezra chapter one,

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.469
verses one through six, and follow along.

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:59.110
In the first year of King Cyrus of Persia,

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.469
in order that Jehovah's word spoken by Jeremiah

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:02.949
would be fulfilled,

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:05.870
Jehovah stirred the spirit of King Cyrus of Persia

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.669
to make a proclamation throughout his kingdom,

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:11.750
which he also put in writing, saying,

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.469
this is what King Cyrus of Persia says.

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:18.189
Jehovah, the God of the heavens,

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:21.310
has given me all the kingdoms of the earth,

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.270
and he has commissioned me to build him a house in Jerusalem,

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.949
which is in Judah.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.229
Whoever there is among you of all his people,

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:32.349
may his God be with him,

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.590
and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah,

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.469
and rebuild the house of Jehovah, the God of Israel.

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:44.069
He is the true God whose house was in Jerusalem.

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.669
Anyone who is residing as a foreigner,

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:48.430
wherever he may be,

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.830
let him be helped by his neighbors,

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.349
by their giving him silver and gold,

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.310
goods and livestock,

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.270
along with the voluntary offering

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.750
for the house of the true God, which was in Jerusalem.

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:05.310
Then, the heads of the paternal houses of Judah,

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.789
and of Benjamin, and the priests and the Levites,

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:11.870
everyone who spirit the true God had stirred,

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.389
prepared to go up and rebuild the house of Jehovah,

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:17.589
which was in Jerusalem.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:19.910
All those around them supported them

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.110
by giving them utensils of silver and of gold,

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.389
goods, livestock, and valuable things,

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:29.350
besides all the voluntary offerings.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.149
Just imagine, Jehovah returns the Jews to their land

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:37.470
with a commission from King Cyrus himself

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.310
to rebuild the temple.

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.350
Many Jews joyfully take up this assignment.

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.310
However, those who for various reasons cannot

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.310
give financial support to those who can,

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.550
likely in the early spring of 537 BCE,

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.750
nearly 50,000 Israelites depart Babylon,

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.269
leading them are high priest Jesua,

00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:03.310
also called Jesua,

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.310
and the governor whom Cyrus appointed,

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.069
cerebral.

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:11.670
In the early autumn, they arrive in Judah,

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.310
and they are joyful.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.509
But how can they sustain that joy?

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:20.509
Note what they do as soon as they get settled.

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:25.670
Let's read Ezra chapter 3 verses 1 through 6.

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.670
When the 7th month arrived,

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.029
and the Israelites were in their cities,

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:33.430
they gathered together with one accord in Jerusalem.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.110
Jesua, the son of Jehazadak, and his fellow priests,

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.870
and Zerubabel, the son of Shialtyel, and his brothers,

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.230
rose up and built the altar of the God of Israel

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.389
so that they could offer up burnt sacrifices on it.

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:49.750
As it is written in the law of Moses,

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.029
the man of the true God.

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:54.829
So they set the altar up on its former site,

00:05:54.829 --> 00:05:58.389
despite their fear of the peoples of the surrounding lands,

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:02.110
and they began offering up burnt sacrifices to Jehovah on it,

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.750
the morning and the evening burnt sacrifices.

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.029
Then they held the festival of booze,

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:09.709
according to what is written,

00:06:09.709 --> 00:06:12.629
and day by day they offered up the specified number

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:16.350
of burnt sacrifices that were required each day.

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:19.990
Afterward, they offered up the regular burnt offering,

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.069
and the offerings for the new moons,

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:25.990
and those for all the sanctified festival seasons of Jehovah,

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:27.829
as well as those from everyone

00:06:27.829 --> 00:06:31.430
who willingly offered a voluntary offering to Jehovah.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.990
From the first day of the 7th month,

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.389
they started to offer up burnt sacrifices to Jehovah,

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:39.550
though the foundation of Jehovah's Temple

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.269
had not yet been laid.

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:47.189
Did you notice that the Jews re-institute Jehovah's worship,

00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:50.910
despite their fear of the peoples of the surrounding lands?

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.269
Because of their courageous action,

00:06:54.269 --> 00:06:57.670
this is a very joyful time.

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.870
It's just as Moses said when he instructed the nations

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.589
to celebrate the festival of booze.

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:07.949
You will become nothing but joyful.

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:10.870
The next year, they courageously and joyfully

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:13.350
lay the foundation for the temple.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.550
Let's read about that at Ezra chapter three,

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.430
verses 10 through 13.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.910
When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of Jehovah,

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:27.310
then the priests in official clothing with the trumpets,

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:31.069
and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with the symbols,

00:07:31.069 --> 00:07:33.430
stood up to praise Jehovah

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.230
according to the direction of King David of Israel.

00:07:37.709 --> 00:07:40.870
And they began to sing in response by praising

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:44.430
and giving thanks to Jehovah for he is good.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:47.949
His loyal love toward Israel endures forever.

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:53.149
Then all the people shouted with a loud shout of praise

00:07:53.149 --> 00:07:55.990
to Jehovah because the foundation of the house

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:57.910
of Jehovah had been laid.

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.670
Many of the priests, the Levites,

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:03.910
and the heads of the paternal houses,

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:07.110
the old man who had seen the former house,

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:10.069
wept with a loud voice when they saw the foundation

00:08:10.069 --> 00:08:13.230
of this house being laid while many others

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:16.230
shouted joyfully at the top of their voice

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:18.110
so the people could not distinguish

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:21.790
the sound of the joyful shouts from the sound of the weeping

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.550
for the people were shouting so loudly

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:27.470
that the sound was heard from a great distance.

00:08:29.069 --> 00:08:31.509
Yes, some of the oldest members of the nation

00:08:31.509 --> 00:08:35.710
cannot imagine how this temple could possibly

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:38.070
match the glory of Solomon's temple.

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:43.789
But the others joyful shouting overpowers their weeping.

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:46.549
The people of the surrounding lands, however,

00:08:46.549 --> 00:08:48.870
do not rejoice.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:52.629
Instead, they cunningly target Israel's joy.

00:08:52.629 --> 00:08:57.629
Let's see how in Israel, chapter four, verses one through three.

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.269
When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin

00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:04.110
heard that the returned exiles were building a temple

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.309
to Jehovah the God of Israel,

00:09:06.309 --> 00:09:08.909
they immediately approached the rubble bell

00:09:08.909 --> 00:09:12.070
and the heads of the paternal houses and said to them,

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.470
let us build along with you.

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:18.750
For like you, we worship your God

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.830
and we have been sacrificing to him

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.629
since the days of King Zarhadna Viseria

00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:25.590
who brought us here.

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:28.389
However, the rubble and Joshua

00:09:28.389 --> 00:09:31.470
and the rest of the heads of the paternal houses of Israel

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:32.950
said to them,

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:36.429
you have no share with us in building a house to our God,

00:09:36.429 --> 00:09:39.830
for we alone will build it to Jehovah the God of Israel.

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:43.429
Just as King Cyrus, the King of Persia has commanded us.

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:47.950
The rubble discerns that behind their enemies

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:51.549
offer to help lurk bad motives.

00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:53.350
When he rejects their offer,

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:57.789
they try to prevent the Jews from working on the temple.

00:09:57.789 --> 00:10:03.100
Notice how verses four to seven continue.

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.460
Then the people of the land

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.340
were continually discouraging the people of Judah

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.620
and disheartening them from building.

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.340
They hired advisors against them

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.100
to frustrate their plans,

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.580
all the days of King Cyrus of Persia

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:18.379
until the reign of King Darius of Persia.

00:10:18.379 --> 00:10:20.940
At the beginning of the reign of a Hazooerus,

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.860
they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:25.379
and Jerusalem.

00:10:25.379 --> 00:10:28.100
And in the days of King Aras Xerxes of Persia,

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:31.419
Bishlan, Mithredath, Tabiel,

00:10:31.419 --> 00:10:33.259
and the rest of his colleagues

00:10:33.259 --> 00:10:35.539
wrote to Ard Xerxes the King.

00:10:35.539 --> 00:10:38.100
They translated the letter into Aramaic,

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.100
writing it with Aramaic characters.

00:10:43.179 --> 00:10:44.700
Let's read what Riham,

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.940
the chief government official and others

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:49.779
of Israel's enemies right to the King.

00:10:49.779 --> 00:10:53.899
Consider what kind of false accusations they make

00:10:53.899 --> 00:10:58.379
as recorded in Ezra 4 verses 11 through 16.

00:10:58.379 --> 00:11:01.179
This is a copy of the letter that they sent him.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.820
To King Aras Xerxes from your servants,

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.980
the men of the region beyond the river.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.139
And now, let it be known to the King

00:11:12.139 --> 00:11:15.259
that the Jews who came up here from you to us

00:11:15.259 --> 00:11:17.620
have arrived at Jerusalem.

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:21.299
They are rebuilding the rebellious and wicked city

00:11:21.299 --> 00:11:22.980
and they are finishing the walls

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.500
and repairing the foundations.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:27.419
Now let it be known to the King

00:11:27.419 --> 00:11:29.700
that if this city should be rebuilt

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.539
and its walls finished,

00:11:31.539 --> 00:11:35.860
they will not give tax, tribute, or toll

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:40.460
and it will result in a loss to the treasuries of the Kings.

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:43.259
Since we eat the salt of the palace

00:11:43.259 --> 00:11:48.139
and it is not proper for us to see the King's interests harmed,

00:11:48.139 --> 00:11:52.259
we have therefore sent to make this known to the King

00:11:52.259 --> 00:11:54.620
so that there may be an investigation

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:58.340
of the book of records of your ancestors.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.379
You will find in the book of records

00:12:00.379 --> 00:12:04.179
and learn that this city is a rebellious city,

00:12:04.179 --> 00:12:07.419
injurious to kings and provinces

00:12:07.419 --> 00:12:10.220
and within it have been those stirring up

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.299
sedition from ancient times.

00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:17.299
That is why this city was destroyed.

00:12:17.299 --> 00:12:19.659
We are making known to the King

00:12:19.659 --> 00:12:24.100
that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are finished,

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:28.700
you will have no control of the region beyond the river.

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:31.980
To those false accusations sound familiar?

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:34.019
They are the same ones our enemies

00:12:34.019 --> 00:12:37.019
sometimes hurl against us today.

00:12:37.019 --> 00:12:39.019
They don't pay taxes.

00:12:39.019 --> 00:12:41.820
They work against the government's interests.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.779
They are rebellious and seditious.

00:12:44.779 --> 00:12:47.419
They are uncontrollable.

00:12:47.419 --> 00:12:50.259
All false charges, of course.

00:12:50.259 --> 00:12:53.980
And back then they had their effect.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:56.019
The King orders the work halted

00:12:56.019 --> 00:12:59.620
and temple rebuilding comes to a standstill.

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.139
How sad.

00:13:01.139 --> 00:13:03.299
When the Jews first returned,

00:13:03.299 --> 00:13:06.659
they didn't let fear of man stop them

00:13:06.659 --> 00:13:08.899
from doing Jehovah's work.

00:13:08.899 --> 00:13:10.820
But now they do.

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:16.179
Many of us today face increasing opposition to Jehovah's work.

00:13:16.179 --> 00:13:19.500
But compromising our giving up has never

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:23.899
brought anyone joy just the opposite.

00:13:23.899 --> 00:13:26.659
Remaining faithful brings joy,

00:13:26.659 --> 00:13:29.620
even in the face of violent persecution.

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:32.460
But how is that possible?

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:35.259
Consider a true life example.

00:13:35.259 --> 00:13:37.059
Picture a mother and daughter

00:13:37.059 --> 00:13:40.379
surrounded by a mob of angry men

00:13:40.379 --> 00:13:43.659
demanding that they buy political party cards.

00:13:43.659 --> 00:13:45.740
What would the sisters do?

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:48.860
If they compromised and bought the cards,

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:50.860
their persecutors would rejoice.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:54.259
But afterward the sisters would be miserable,

00:13:54.259 --> 00:13:57.659
knowing they had denied their heavenly father.

00:13:57.659 --> 00:14:00.419
The sisters did not give in.

00:14:00.419 --> 00:14:04.820
Of course they didn't enjoy being ridiculed and mistreated.

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:08.379
Later, however, their consciences were clean.

00:14:08.379 --> 00:14:11.019
And they felt deep joy,

00:14:11.019 --> 00:14:15.940
knowing they had remained faithful to Jehovah.

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:18.580
What about the Jews of Ezra's day?

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:21.500
Many may have left a stable life in Babylon

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.820
to make the Argus trek to Judah.

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:28.860
Now after about 14 years of constant opposition

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:32.580
from the lane of the temple's foundation up to the ban,

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:36.860
the Jews have lost their zeal for Jehovah's work.

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:40.299
They go through the motions of offering sacrifices,

00:14:40.299 --> 00:14:45.299
but they're not doing what Jehovah told them to do,

00:14:45.299 --> 00:14:48.259
finish rebuilding the temple.

00:14:48.299 --> 00:14:49.860
When they meet resistance,

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:53.700
they rationalize that it must not be Jehovah's time

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.539
to finish the work.

00:14:55.539 --> 00:14:57.500
Apparently even the governor is irrebable

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.500
and high priest Jeshua need encouragement.

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:04.740
To provide it, Jehovah sends the prophet Haggai.

00:15:05.659 --> 00:15:08.500
Let's turn now to the book of Haggai chapter one.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.379
Haggai's clear and powerful messages delivered

00:15:12.379 --> 00:15:14.860
during a period of about four months

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.379
get right to the heart of the matter.

00:15:17.419 --> 00:15:21.259
That we read at Haggai chapter one versus two through 11.

00:15:22.179 --> 00:15:25.620
This is what Jehovah of Army says.

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:28.419
These people say the time is not yet

00:15:28.419 --> 00:15:31.419
come for the house of Jehovah to be built.

00:15:31.419 --> 00:15:34.820
And the word of Jehovah again came through Haggai the prophet

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:38.659
saying, is it the time for you to dwell

00:15:38.659 --> 00:15:43.659
in your panelled houses while this house lies in ruins?

00:15:43.659 --> 00:15:46.860
Now this is what Jehovah of Army says.

00:15:46.899 --> 00:15:49.700
Set your heart on your ways.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:53.580
You have so much seed, but you harvest little.

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:56.820
You eat, but it is not to satisfaction.

00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:00.100
You drink, but you do not drink your fill.

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:03.899
You put on clothing, but no one gets warm.

00:16:03.899 --> 00:16:07.460
The one who hires himself out puts his wages

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:10.220
in a bag full of holes.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.860
This is what Jehovah of Army says.

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:16.820
Set your heart on your ways.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:20.059
Go up to the mountain and bring in lumber

00:16:20.059 --> 00:16:24.220
and build the house so that I may take pleasure in it

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:27.700
and I may be glorified, Jehovah says.

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:31.860
You were expecting much and receiving little.

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:35.620
And when you brought it into the house, I blew it away.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.539
For what reason declares Jehovah of Army's?

00:16:38.539 --> 00:16:41.700
Because my house is in ruins

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:45.820
while each of you runs around taking care of his own house.

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:48.980
So the heavens above you withheld their due

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:51.419
and the earth withheld its produce.

00:16:51.419 --> 00:16:54.779
And I kept calling for a drought on the earth,

00:16:54.779 --> 00:16:58.659
on the mountains, on the grain, on the new wine,

00:16:58.659 --> 00:17:01.779
on the oil, on what grows from the ground,

00:17:01.779 --> 00:17:03.740
on humans and livestock,

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:07.259
and on all the labor of your hands.

00:17:07.259 --> 00:17:10.660
Jehovah compares the results of the Jews' self-centered efforts

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:13.619
to those of a hired worker who puts his wages

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:16.380
into a moth eaten sack.

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:19.579
Because the Jews are neglecting the house of Jehovah,

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:22.099
he holds back his blessing.

00:17:22.099 --> 00:17:24.940
The results of the Jews' labor are limited

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:28.059
and their lives lack joy.

00:17:28.059 --> 00:17:30.900
Evidently, some try to feel that void

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:34.220
by beautifying their own homes.

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:38.740
But material things cannot satisfy spiritual needs.

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:42.059
Can we see the warning here for us?

00:17:42.059 --> 00:17:45.140
It's not wrong to enjoy nice things,

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:50.140
but material things cannot bring us true and lasting joy,

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:55.299
especially if we neglect Jehovah's work to obtain them.

00:17:55.299 --> 00:17:59.140
Remember the lesson of Psalm 127, verse 1?

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.220
Unless Jehovah builds the house,

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:05.740
it is in vain that his builders work hard on it.

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:10.539
On the other hand, when we unselfishly seek first God's kingdom

00:18:10.539 --> 00:18:15.220
and his righteousness, he provides what we really need

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:18.740
and adjust the right time.

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:22.900
As Proverbs chapter 10, verse 22 tells us,

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:27.299
it is the blessing of Jehovah that makes one rich,

00:18:27.299 --> 00:18:30.259
and he adds no pain with it.

00:18:30.259 --> 00:18:32.859
But now will this rebuild temple really not

00:18:32.859 --> 00:18:37.019
attain to its former glory, as some believe?

00:18:37.019 --> 00:18:39.259
So hey, guys, Jehovah guarantees

00:18:39.259 --> 00:18:44.380
that the future glory of this house will be even greater.

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:50.500
Let's continue reading the hey guy, chapter 2, verses 3 through 9.

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:55.380
Who is left among you who saw this house in its former glory?

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.380
How does it look to you now?

00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:00.900
Does it not seem like nothing in comparison?

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:05.220
But now be strong, Zerubabel, declares to Jehovah,

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:09.460
and be strong Joshua, son of Jehazadak, the high priest,

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:13.700
and be strong all you people of the land declares to Jehovah.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:19.700
And work for I am with you, declares to Jehovah of armies.

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:23.299
Remember what I promised you when you came out of Egypt,

00:19:23.299 --> 00:19:25.980
and my spirit remains among you.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.140
Do not be afraid.

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:31.180
For this is what Jehovah of Army says,

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:33.980
Yet once more in a little while,

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:36.859
and I will shake the heavens and the earth,

00:19:36.859 --> 00:19:39.259
and the sea and the dry land,

00:19:39.259 --> 00:19:42.220
and I will shake all the nations,

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:45.660
and the precious things of all the nations will come in,

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:48.819
and I will fill this house with glory,

00:19:48.819 --> 00:19:50.900
says Jehovah of armies.

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:54.220
The silver is mine, and the gold is mine,

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:56.500
declares Jehovah of armies.

00:19:56.500 --> 00:20:00.700
The future glory of this house will be greater than the former,

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.299
as Jehovah of armies.

00:20:03.299 --> 00:20:06.900
Yes, when the creator and owner of the entire universe

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:10.940
declares his purpose, who or what could possibly

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:13.539
prevent him from carrying it out?

00:20:13.539 --> 00:20:16.339
Nothing and no one.

00:20:16.339 --> 00:20:20.299
Jehovah's straightforward message is unmistakable.

00:20:20.299 --> 00:20:23.940
Still, the return ease need more encouragement.

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:29.500
Jehovah sends his angel to another prophet, Sakharaya.

00:20:29.539 --> 00:20:32.299
Please turn to Sakharaya, chapter one,

00:20:32.299 --> 00:20:34.259
verses 12 through 16,

00:20:34.259 --> 00:20:38.019
and let's read together the angel's reassuring words

00:20:38.019 --> 00:20:39.339
for Israel.

00:20:39.339 --> 00:20:45.250
That's Sakharaya, one, 12 through 16.

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:47.529
So the angel of Jehovah said,

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:51.130
Oh, Jehovah of armies,

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:54.450
how long will you withhold your mercy from Jerusalem,

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:56.130
and the cities of Judah,

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:58.970
with whom you have been indignant these 70 years?

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:02.730
Jehovah answered the angel who was speaking with me

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:05.529
with kind and comforting words.

00:21:05.529 --> 00:21:09.130
Then the angel who was speaking with me told me,

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:13.369
call out, this is what Jehovah of armies says.

00:21:13.369 --> 00:21:15.250
I am zealous for Jerusalem,

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:17.970
and for Zion with a great zeal.

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:20.569
With great indignation, I am indignant

00:21:20.569 --> 00:21:22.769
with the nations that are at ease,

00:21:22.769 --> 00:21:25.930
because I felt indignant to a small extent,

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:28.529
but they added to the calamity.

00:21:28.569 --> 00:21:31.769
Therefore, this is what Jehovah said.

00:21:31.769 --> 00:21:34.970
I will return to Jerusalem with mercy,

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:37.769
and my own house will be built in her,

00:21:37.769 --> 00:21:40.130
declares Jehovah of armies,

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:43.450
and a measuring line will be stretched out over Jerusalem.

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:48.130
To emphasize just how protective Jehovah will be,

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:52.490
the angel continues at chapter two, verses seven through nine.

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:56.890
Come, Zion, make your escape.

00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:59.890
You who are dwelling with the daughter of Babylon?

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:02.450
For this is what Jehovah of army says,

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:05.009
who after being glorified has sent me

00:22:05.009 --> 00:22:07.970
to the nations that were plundering you.

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:12.970
Whoever touches you touches the pupil of my eye.

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:16.210
For now, I will wave my hand against them,

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:19.569
and they will become plunder for their own slaves,

00:22:19.569 --> 00:22:23.289
and you will certainly know that Jehovah of armies has sent me.

00:22:24.289 --> 00:22:28.009
Would you let someone poke his finger in your eye?

00:22:28.009 --> 00:22:29.809
Of course not.

00:22:29.809 --> 00:22:34.210
Neither will Jehovah allow Israel's opposers to harm them.

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:38.009
Then, in Zechariah chapter three, verses one and two,

00:22:38.009 --> 00:22:42.849
the angel reveals the greater enemy behind the opposition.

00:22:42.849 --> 00:22:46.009
And he showed me Joshua the high priest

00:22:46.009 --> 00:22:48.450
standing before the angel of Jehovah,

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:52.690
and Satan was standing at his right hand to resist him.

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:56.130
Then the angel of Jehovah said to Satan,

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:59.569
may Jehovah rebuke you, O Satan?

00:22:59.569 --> 00:23:04.289
Yes, may Jehovah, who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you,

00:23:04.289 --> 00:23:08.250
is not this one a burning log snatched out of the fire?

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:14.490
Is all this intended simply to build up Israel's confidence

00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:18.049
in themselves on the contrary?

00:23:18.049 --> 00:23:22.650
They need to remember that only with Jehovah's help

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:25.450
can they accomplish anything.

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:28.529
Listen to the angel's further words to Zechariah

00:23:28.529 --> 00:23:31.650
in chapter four, verses six through seven.

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:35.369
This is the word of Jehovah to the Rebbebele.

00:23:35.369 --> 00:23:39.049
Not by a military force, nor by power,

00:23:39.049 --> 00:23:42.930
but by my spirit, says Jehovah of armies.

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:45.569
Who are you, O great mountain?

00:23:45.569 --> 00:23:49.849
Before the Rebbebele, you will become a level land,

00:23:49.849 --> 00:23:52.329
and he will bring out the top stone,

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:56.890
amid chalice of how wonderful, how wonderful.

00:23:58.289 --> 00:24:00.809
Energized by Jehovah's motivating words

00:24:00.809 --> 00:24:02.410
through his two prophets,

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:05.009
the Jews stopped wavering in a lack of faith

00:24:05.009 --> 00:24:07.809
and resumed construction of the temple.

00:24:07.809 --> 00:24:10.490
Predictively, Israel's enemy, neighbors,

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:13.609
led by Tatinai and Seth Arbazini,

00:24:13.609 --> 00:24:16.210
also spring interaction.

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:18.289
Returning to the book of Ezra,

00:24:18.289 --> 00:24:21.849
we read at chapter five, verses three through five.

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:25.769
At that time, Tatinai, the governor of the region

00:24:25.769 --> 00:24:28.089
beyond the river, and sheath Arbazini,

00:24:28.089 --> 00:24:31.089
and their colleagues came to them and asked them,

00:24:31.089 --> 00:24:34.490
who issued an order to you to build this house

00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:36.730
and to finish this structure?

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:38.769
Then they asked them,

00:24:38.769 --> 00:24:39.970
what are the names of the men

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:42.569
who are working on this building?

00:24:42.569 --> 00:24:45.450
But God was watching over the elders of the Jews,

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:47.529
and they did not stop them until the report

00:24:47.529 --> 00:24:49.130
could be sent to Darius,

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:51.089
and an official document could be sent

00:24:51.089 --> 00:24:52.569
by concerning this.

00:24:53.529 --> 00:24:56.049
So there's another lesson for us today,

00:24:56.049 --> 00:24:58.890
when we courageously do Jehovah's work

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:00.730
despite opposition.

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:02.930
Jehovah blesses our efforts

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:06.690
and enables us to keep on serving him.

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:09.130
For now though, the Jews must continue

00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:12.289
their work on the temple under ban.

00:25:12.289 --> 00:25:14.250
The king who issued the ban, however,

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:18.529
was assassinated after raining only seven months.

00:25:18.529 --> 00:25:21.970
So Tatinai and his accomplices are dealing

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:26.329
with a new king, Darius I.

00:25:26.329 --> 00:25:28.210
In denouncing the Jews,

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:32.250
they try to use the rubbables' own words against him,

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:35.089
including his statement that King Cyrus

00:25:35.089 --> 00:25:38.089
issued the order to rebuild the temple.

00:25:38.089 --> 00:25:41.089
They asked King Darius to investigate

00:25:41.089 --> 00:25:43.769
whether that's really so.

00:25:43.769 --> 00:25:46.369
Darius orders the investigation.

00:25:46.369 --> 00:25:49.009
What will King Darius decide?

00:25:49.009 --> 00:25:51.890
Will the Jews renewed faith and determination,

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:55.329
bring them joy, or just more trouble?

00:25:55.329 --> 00:25:58.210
Darius learns that Cyrus did indeed

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:01.130
order that the temple be rebuilt.

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:04.250
At Ezra chapter six, verses six to twelve,

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:09.210
we read Darius stinging reply.

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:12.289
So now, Tatinai, the governor of the region

00:26:12.289 --> 00:26:13.650
beyond the river,

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:16.329
sheeth our Bosonite and your colleagues,

00:26:16.369 --> 00:26:19.490
the lesser governors of the region beyond the river.

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:21.369
Stay away from there.

00:26:21.369 --> 00:26:24.849
Do not interfere with the work on that house of God.

00:26:24.849 --> 00:26:27.769
The governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews

00:26:27.769 --> 00:26:31.049
will rebuild that house of God in its former place.

00:26:32.009 --> 00:26:34.369
Furthermore, I am issuing an order

00:26:34.369 --> 00:26:37.049
as to what you are to do for these elders of the Jews

00:26:37.049 --> 00:26:39.769
for rebuilding that house of God.

00:26:39.769 --> 00:26:41.450
From the royal treasury,

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:44.529
from the tax collected in the region beyond the river,

00:26:44.529 --> 00:26:46.730
the expenses are to be promptly given

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:50.410
to these men to continue without interruption.

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:53.009
And whatever is needed, young bulls,

00:26:53.009 --> 00:26:54.809
as well as rams and lambs,

00:26:54.809 --> 00:26:57.809
for the burnt offerings to the God of heaven,

00:26:57.809 --> 00:27:01.329
wheat, salt, wine, and oil,

00:27:01.329 --> 00:27:04.049
just as the priests or in Jerusalem say,

00:27:04.049 --> 00:27:06.769
is to be given them continually,

00:27:06.769 --> 00:27:09.650
day by day without fail,

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:12.170
so that they may continually present offerings

00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:14.529
that please the God of the heavens

00:27:14.529 --> 00:27:18.009
and pray for the life of the king and his sons.

00:27:19.049 --> 00:27:21.210
I have also issued an order

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:24.089
that if anyone violates this decree,

00:27:24.089 --> 00:27:27.009
a timber will be pulled out of his house

00:27:27.009 --> 00:27:30.170
and he will be lifted up and fastened to it

00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:33.049
and his house will be turned into a publicly treened

00:27:33.049 --> 00:27:34.890
for this offense.

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:38.049
And may the God who has caused his name to reside there

00:27:38.049 --> 00:27:41.690
overthrow any king and people who lift a hand,

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:45.490
to violate this order and destroy that house of God,

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:47.569
which is in Jerusalem.

00:27:47.569 --> 00:27:50.769
I, Narius, issue this order.

00:27:50.769 --> 00:27:52.769
Let it be done promptly.

00:27:54.289 --> 00:27:56.329
Upon receiving the king's command,

00:27:56.329 --> 00:27:59.529
Tata Nai and his colleagues have no choice.

00:27:59.529 --> 00:28:01.650
Not only must they stop interfering

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:03.569
with the work on the temple,

00:28:03.569 --> 00:28:05.609
they must help finance it.

00:28:07.009 --> 00:28:10.569
What a joyful outcome for the faithful Jews.

00:28:10.569 --> 00:28:14.809
In 515 BCE, they hold the inauguration

00:28:14.809 --> 00:28:17.809
of the house of God with joy.

00:28:17.809 --> 00:28:20.490
And as we read it, verse 22,

00:28:21.529 --> 00:28:23.890
they also joyfully held the festival

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:26.170
of unleavened bread for seven days.

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:29.089
For Jehovah caused them to rejoice

00:28:29.089 --> 00:28:30.529
and he had made the heart of the king

00:28:30.529 --> 00:28:32.730
of Assyria favorable toward them

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:34.609
so that he supported them in the work

00:28:34.609 --> 00:28:40.259
of the house of the true God, the God of Israel.

00:28:40.259 --> 00:28:42.740
Today, when wise and just officials

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:45.460
similarly intervene in our behalf,

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:47.940
we're very grateful to them,

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:52.140
but we're most grateful to Jehovah for directing matters.

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:55.220
As Proverbs 21, verse 1 says,

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:59.619
a king's heart is like streams of water in Jehovah's hand.

00:28:59.619 --> 00:29:03.019
He directs it wherever he pleases.

00:29:03.019 --> 00:29:06.779
So we do not put our ultimate hope in any ruler,

00:29:06.779 --> 00:29:09.740
our institution of this world.

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:13.539
None of them can bring us permanent salvation.

00:29:13.539 --> 00:29:15.980
In fact, before the end of Satan's system,

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:20.539
all the nations will turn against Jehovah's people,

00:29:20.539 --> 00:29:23.259
but they'll experience an outcome worse

00:29:23.259 --> 00:29:25.019
than that they've tantinized.

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:29.339
What lessons can we draw from these portions

00:29:29.339 --> 00:29:32.619
of Ezra Haggai and Zachariah?

00:29:32.619 --> 00:29:35.460
First, Jehovah blesses our determined efforts

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:39.819
to keep on doing his work despite challenges,

00:29:39.819 --> 00:29:43.539
but he frustrates the efforts of our composers.

00:29:43.539 --> 00:29:45.339
Second, when we put Jehovah's work

00:29:45.339 --> 00:29:49.579
ahead of material comforts, he gives us true joy.

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:54.500
What's the work Jesus commissioned us to do today?

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:58.940
He made it very clear in his parting words to his followers.

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:02.940
Go, therefore, and make disciples

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:05.259
of people of all the nations.

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:09.180
Are we with our hearts and hands

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:12.500
putting this assignment ahead of material goals?

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:15.940
Haggai, for told that one day,

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:19.859
Jehovah's temple would become far more glorious

00:30:19.859 --> 00:30:22.539
than the one Solomon built.

00:30:22.539 --> 00:30:25.900
That prophecy is being fulfilled today.

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:30.900
Jehovah is using our preaching to shake the nations,

00:30:31.339 --> 00:30:35.180
millions of precious things, new worshipers

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:37.460
are coming to him.

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:41.660
These are joyfully flocking to the great spiritual temple,

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:44.339
Jehovah's arrangement for worshiping him

00:30:44.339 --> 00:30:47.779
on the basis of Jesus' ransom sacrifice.

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:52.859
Now is not the time to focus our attention

00:30:52.859 --> 00:30:57.859
on paneled houses or on any other unnecessary pursuit.

00:30:58.859 --> 00:31:02.859
Very soon, on a day we do not expect

00:31:02.859 --> 00:31:07.859
Satan's world will end and we will enter Jehovah's New World.

00:31:08.859 --> 00:31:14.859
So no matter how Satan tries to discourage our distractus now,

00:31:14.859 --> 00:31:19.859
may we never let him rob us of our joy in Jehovah.

00:31:19.859 --> 00:31:25.859
May we rather walk with Jehovah right into his peaceful New World

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:30.660
where we will serve him forever with rejoicing.

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:35.660
Zerapobo, Joshua, Haggai, and Zachariah have done much

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:40.460
to help Israel regain Jehovah's favor.

00:31:41.339 --> 00:31:43.700
Later in 468 BCE,

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:48.380
Ezra himself comes to Jerusalem to support Jewish him.

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:51.700
But the nation needs still more direction.

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:56.099
So Jehovah sends them another brave leader.

00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:59.700
During the next two days of this convention,

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:04.700
we'll learn about that faithful and powerful man, Nehemiah.
