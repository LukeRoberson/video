00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:20.100
Thousands of years ago, God's people gathered at the foot of Mount Sinai to receive spiritual

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:28.019
instruction from Jehovah. Since then, modern day gatherings, our conventions have played a

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.100
significant role in the history of pure worship. The same is true with our large special and

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:40.899
international conventions today. This report will highlight some of the aspects of planning for

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:46.820
special and international conventions. We'll see how the pandemic affected the plans that were

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:55.299
in place for special conventions in 2020 and what it took to reinstate this arrangement for 2024.

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:03.299
But have you ever wondered what's the difference between a special and an international convention?

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:10.579
In 2012, the governing body determined there'd be special conventions every year. What makes

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:15.140
these special is they're in different parts of the world, maybe 15 different countries.

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:20.019
And they're usually a larger venue, so there could be 20,000 in attendance.

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:26.260
And of that number, about 3,500 are invited from different countries around the world.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.819
And then every five years or so, the governing body has approved international conventions.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.420
Well, an international convention is generally bigger, maybe 30,000 or more people in attendance,

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.099
and about 5,000, I guess, are invited from different parts of the world. And the other thing about

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:51.140
an international convention you might remember from the past is that we have the opportunity in our

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:58.500
kingdom halls to contribute some monies, and that allows missionaries and those informed service

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.140
to be able to fly to the convention of their choice.

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:09.300
How did the COVID-19 pandemic affect plans that were in place for special conventions in 2020?

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.500
And what did it take to reinstate this arrangement for 2024?

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:21.539
The conventions were due to start in just a few months. We had 22,000 delegates that had booked flights

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:25.460
that were anxious to get to their locations. They would have to be informed that they

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.860
needed to do some rescheduling, perhaps get a refund. That there were hotel contracts,

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.460
there were venue contracts that had to be postponed. The Teaching Committee was very clear that

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.780
when our brothers reached out to the hotels, to the venues, to the cities,

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.419
the message was not that we were canceling this event, but the event was going to be postponed.

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:50.340
The Teaching Committee made this decision before COVID began to rage. So many of the vendors we

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.060
were working with didn't quite understand our position at first, but it was very clear that

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.060
Jehovah was behind the decision they made. Happily, these discussions went well.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.340
Most of the venues returned our deposits, while some held the deposits for when we could resume

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.819
our conventions. At first, we thought we would simply move the eight special conventions from 2020

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:21.539
over to 2021. There were 15 special conventions tentatively planned for 2021, so we would have

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:27.060
23 special conventions that year. That's what we thought, but things got even more difficult

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.020
when we realized it wasn't just going to be a year delay, but rather the situation became

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:38.580
until further notice. The governing body has been very concerned with the safety of our brothers.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:45.219
We want our conventions and our meetings to be spiritually up building, but also physically safe.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.259
They came to the conclusion that through electronic means we could still have all of our

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:57.620
conventions, but there's still something missing with that kind of meeting, experiencing the

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.379
sights and sounds of a convention, hearing the laughter, the silence, the singing together,

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:07.939
to see people we haven't seen for a long time to see how Jehovah's enabled them to endure

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:13.780
to make spiritual progress. These are all wonderful blessings. The brothers felt it when

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:21.540
we couldn't have these things regularly for the friends. In October 2022, the governing body

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:30.339
directed that special conventions could resume in 2024. We were very excited, and then we realized

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:35.939
how much work we had to do in very little time. We had just several months to accomplish what

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:41.939
normally takes over 20 months to do, so we were so grateful that the host branches had done much

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:47.699
of the preliminary work well before our 2020. We originally planned to have eight conventions

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:53.620
in 2020. It was clear that the governing body wanted many more conventions to be held,

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:00.579
and so we reached out to the branches that were in the preliminary stages of planning the 2021

00:05:00.579 --> 00:05:06.180
conventions to include them in the plans. We were able to put a list together and present it to

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.420
the teaching committee, and we were really excited to see the results coming back that they had

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:18.100
approved 15 locations for 2024. The wheels began turning for the 2024 special conventions.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.019
But what's involved with planning for a special convention?

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:29.939
The committee is absolutely enthusiastic. They are delighted. They really want to do everything they

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:35.379
can to make this a great success so that we can welcome the delegates and so that it has a

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:41.379
strong impact in the ministry. Thus it becomes, we could say, the priority of the branch committee.

00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:48.500
So regarding the organization of a special convention, it starts approximately two years before

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:55.699
the special convention takes place. Why two years? Well, because the governing body wants to ensure

00:05:56.339 --> 00:06:02.899
that both the hotel accommodations and the special convention venue are suitable for a large number

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:09.540
of delegates. Most venues, their visitors are only there for a few hours, maybe for a concert

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:15.139
or for a sporting event, but for our brothers and sisters, they're at a convention for many hours.

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:20.740
So we are concerned about the learning environment. Is it a comfortable learning environment?

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:27.060
Places to eat are also important for the delegates, good transportation to and from the venue,

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:32.180
and a good airport that can support thousands of flights coming in every day from around the world.

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:40.980
Some countries it's known that they have terrorist activity, violence, particularly toward tourists,

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:46.980
but in addition you have to even look at the political situation because if there's been a change in

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:54.980
the administration, then there could be civil unrest. Can we arrange it for a time that would be

00:06:54.980 --> 00:07:01.939
convenient for all, but also more economical for our brothers who are traveling to those

00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:07.699
kinds of places? And what will be their experience when they get there? Will they have to deal with

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:15.060
the oppressive heat, excessive cold? The brothers are aware of it because they want to be hospitable.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:21.540
They want to create an environment that's conducive for good wholesome association without distraction.

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:28.100
Once the Teaching Committee finalizes country locations, the work shifts into high gear.

00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:34.100
There's many ways that we see Jehovah's direction in organizing these events. Our brothers know

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:40.339
how to do conventions. They've been doing conventions for decades. Organizing 150 buses,

00:07:40.339 --> 00:07:46.100
organizing delegates to do activities, tour guides. This is something they need assistance with.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:50.980
And so what we found is that Jehovah, by means of his spirit, is able to really

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:54.259
help these people rise up and be able to accomplish the tasks.

00:07:54.259 --> 00:08:01.139
We couldn't get that work done without the brothers and sisters and those congregations that are

00:08:01.139 --> 00:08:07.620
in the host branch because they're thrilled to be able to help out in whatever capacity they can.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:12.899
And we really couldn't do the work without them. Any of you who have had the experience of

00:08:12.899 --> 00:08:19.540
attending a special or international convention know the love and happiness of our brotherhood

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:26.579
is on full display for all to see. In Ukraine, we saw the unity of our local brothers and sisters

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:30.899
but we never saw it global until we came here to the convention.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:38.740
And we saw our brothers and sisters from Asia, Africa, all around the earth hugging each other

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:45.299
and associating. We fought back tears but our hearts were so deeply touched.

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:53.500
To hear everyone that attended this international convention singing the songs in different languages

00:08:54.220 --> 00:09:03.419
was amazing. What touched me the most is the hospitality. When I return back to Ethiopia,

00:09:03.419 --> 00:09:11.019
I learned that I need to show hospitality. I need to open my heart wider to fill it with all this love.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:20.139
It's full and it's overflowing. Thank you so much. I really appreciate this convention.

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:29.259
Jehovah, his people are here. We hope to welcome you as a delegate to a future special or international

00:09:29.259 --> 00:09:36.860
convention. As hundreds of thousands of your brothers and sisters can tell you it's an experience

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.860
you will never forget.
