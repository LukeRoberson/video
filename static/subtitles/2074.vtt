00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:10.820
Since its inception in 2014, the school for Kingdom of Angelizers has accomplished

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:20.260
much good in the worldwide field as SKE graduates helped to further Kingdom

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:28.140
interests. This two-month school is designed to train experienced pioneers who are

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:35.100
willing to serve wherever they're needed. And while many have eagerly reached out

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:45.700
for this opportunity, others hold back. Why? That first I was very scared because at

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.659
that time when we got called I wasn't the best pioneer ever, so I felt a bit

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:56.939
unworthy. What worried me a little was not knowing how I would make a living in

00:00:56.939 --> 00:01:05.939
my new assignment. Would I live up to what is expected of an SKE student? One of my

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.299
concerns about going to the school was that I didn't know where I would be

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:16.420
sent, what the place would be like, and what my life would be like. In my culture,

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.420
family stick together and we don't leave. And it worried me that I could be sent

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:29.180
far away. I had my fears about the assignment we would get after SKE, and I was

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.019
concerned about whether we would keep up with everything we had to learn. Well,

00:01:34.019 --> 00:01:41.859
can you relate to any of these feelings? If so, please know that the governing

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:49.700
body understands. It's not easy to uproot one's self and venture into the

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:59.739
unknown, but before you dismiss applying for SKE, we warmly invite you to

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:07.340
prayerfully consider making yourself available to Jehovah for this training with a

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:14.860
view to expanding your service. A beautiful reason for reaching out in Jehovah's

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:24.460
service can be found in a dynamic Bible example. In Judges 4, Jehovah commands

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:31.900
Bayrach to find 10,000 volunteers, march to the top of Mount Tabor, and await

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:40.139
Jehovah's signal to battle the mighty Cicero and his army. But remember, unlike

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:45.860
their Canaanite enemies, the Israelites were untrained in warfare, had limited

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:53.900
weapons, and were massively outnumbered. Those who volunteered would have to leave

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:01.860
home, climb a mountain, and wait for instructions. In effect, they had appeared weak

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.060
and helpless while the powerful Canaanite armies gathered all around them at the

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:16.460
base of the mountain. Now from a human viewpoint, there were many good reasons not to

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:25.460
volunteer for this mission. How would you feel? Would you go? Well, the ones who did

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:35.139
go got to experience something awe-inspiring. Judges 5 tells us that as soon as

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:42.259
Jehovah gave the word for them to charge down that mountain, the earth shook, and the

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:52.219
heavens poured. Seemingly, out of nowhere, a powerful storm came, and Cicero and his army

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:58.860
were thrown into confusion. Right behind that storm came the Israelites. Thanks to

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:07.159
Jehovah's help, they defeated their enemies and won the battle. Now did they

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:16.019
rack and his men? No. That divine storm was coming? No. But they knew something

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:23.259
else. Read with me, please. Jehovah's words to them, right before they charged

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:35.379
down the mountain at Judges 4, verse 14. Rise up for this is the day that Jehovah will

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:43.779
give Cicero into your hand. Is Jehovah not going out before you? And here's the

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:50.500
beautiful reason mentioned earlier. Have you ever entered into an unfamiliar dark

00:04:50.620 --> 00:05:00.019
room and a friend says, don't worry, I'll go first. I know where the light is. You feel

00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:06.379
safe, right? Well, in a similar way, when Jehovah said to those Israelites that he would

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:15.779
go out before them, it says, if he was saying, don't worry, I'll go first. And I won't

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:27.459
let anything happen to you. You see, those men were facing the unknown, the dark, but they trusted

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:34.660
in Jehovah and they got to see firsthand how Jehovah lit it up by bringing that divine storm.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:45.540
In effect, he turned the impossible into the possible. Well dear brothers and sisters,

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:55.139
Jehovah can turn the impossible into the possible for you too. Don't let the unknown hold you

00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:05.300
back and don't let fear cause you to miss out. Just as in Beirak's time, today the call is going

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:15.540
out for volunteers to be used more fully in Jehovah's organization. If your heart moves you to

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:26.100
reach out for SKE, you'll get to see firsthand how Jehovah will daily care for you. When challenges

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:38.339
come and the darkness starts to close in, he will light the way for you. The education at SKE is an

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:44.980
everlasting inheritance. It shepherds our teaching ability all to the praise of Jehovah.

00:06:45.459 --> 00:06:53.779
By taking on the challenge, we are showing our support for Jehovah as the universal sovereign.

00:06:55.379 --> 00:07:00.259
It is a great privilege to be trained by Jehovah using his organization.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:08.420
Now I feel closer to Jehovah. I see him as a real person. I feel happy to have a close relationship

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:18.660
with him. The benefits of having Jehovah invest in me have been that it's changed my view of my

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:26.579
singleness. It's stopped me from limiting myself. It's pushed me beyond the boundaries that I

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:35.620
established from myself. The school prepared me to support the translation work that's being done

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:40.180
in my language and to be able to give my best because Jehovah is great.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:46.019
There's no gift that can exceed being taught by Jehovah.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:52.819
Even if your circumstances don't allow for you to apply to SKE right now,

00:07:54.740 --> 00:08:03.939
don't lose heart. Keep it a matter of prayer. The opportunity may open up for you in the future.

00:08:04.339 --> 00:08:12.579
In the meantime, perhaps you can help someone else in your family or congregation to reach out for SKE.

00:08:12.579 --> 00:08:23.220
By helping others, you too can experience Jehovah's blessing and your life in unexpected and delightful

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:32.500
ways. No matter what your circumstance may be, remember, when you rise to the call and trust in

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:42.179
Jehovah, he will clear the way for you. Former obstacles and fears will be pushed aside and

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:55.860
replaced with new friends and unimaginable joys. Why? Because Jehovah will go out before you.
