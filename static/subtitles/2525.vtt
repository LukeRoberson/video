00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.179
Welcome to another edition of J.W. Broadcasting.

00:00:06.179 --> 00:00:08.980
We have much to share with you this month.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.380
These are some of the highlights.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.380
We will visit with a sister who experienced severe opposition

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.379
from members of her family.

00:00:17.379 --> 00:00:22.379
But she stayed faithful to Jehovah and was rewarded as a result.

00:00:22.379 --> 00:00:27.179
And what can help a servant of Jehovah make a wise career choice?

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:31.980
This young brother was tempted to pursue a risky secular career

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.179
but a scriptural principal helped him make a wise decision.

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:42.579
Also in our program, we will have a new episode of Become Jehovah's Friend

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:45.579
with Caleb and Sophia.

00:00:45.579 --> 00:01:08.989
This is the July program of J.W. Broadcasting.

00:01:08.989 --> 00:01:11.989
As our organization grows,

00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:15.790
so does the need for translation of our literature.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.590
Many remote translation offices have been set up in countries

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.790
around the world to keep improving the quality of our translation work.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:31.790
Recently, one such office was dedicated in the African country of Namibia.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.189
And as experiences show time and time again,

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:42.390
many benefits spiritually from the steady expansion of our translation efforts.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:51.400
Our brothers and sisters in Namibia are no exception.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.799
I am happy because I am able to read the truth in a shkwanyama

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.400
as I cannot read other languages.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.400
Things have become easy to understand

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.799
because it has been explained well and is easily understandable

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.400
it reaches the heart

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.400
as the publications become available in our language

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:16.219
it touched my heart so that I even feel physically strong.

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:22.020
The governing body has realized that if we are going to get the very highest quality translation

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.819
the translators should be in the area where their language is spoken every day

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.819
and many times when the translators were located at branch offices

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.819
far away from where their languages were spoken

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.419
then many other language words were creeping in

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:43.819
and also the people began to lose touch with just the everyday way of expressing things.

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:50.819
A remote translation office is an office where translation and recording of our publication stack place

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.419
we look at where the language is predominantly spoken

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:58.419
and also do we have enough congregations

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:02.020
are we going to have enough publishers to support the translation office?

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.219
Jehovah blessed the decision because our brothers and sisters

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:12.219
from the local congregation can support the translation of this can commute

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:17.419
and also the translators can work along with the congregation.

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:20.419
I work with one of the translation teams

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:23.819
Field Service has a big influence on my work

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.020
it helps me increase my vocabulary

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.620
I hear how people express themselves and that helps me a lot in my assignment

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.620
because the RTO is in the location where the language is originally spoken

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.020
you get to hear expressions that I'm not used to

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.219
and I can also use them during my assignment

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:46.819
my vocabulary also increases because I'm around people who speak the kwaniaman language

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.620
so there is a lot of benefits being in the location

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.819
Remote translation offices really like many things

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.020
I think have come up and kind of fooled the governing body in a sense

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.419
because we didn't really initially see the tremendous value that they would have

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:08.419
because as we've expanded into more and more and more languages

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:13.020
if we would have had to try to have all of these languages at branch offices

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.220
our branch offices would have to be so large

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.220
that the expense would be really overwhelming for the organization

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:32.470
It's a wonderful privilege to be with you brothers and sisters here in Namibia

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:38.990
for this very exciting location

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.589
this is the very first time that so many congregations

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:46.389
have been tied together via internet for a meeting

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:52.589
do you know that the number of Bible studies has increased by one million in just two years

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:57.589
why is it that the number of Bible studies is increasing so much in the world

00:04:57.589 --> 00:05:03.189
we have to attribute this at least in part to the tremendous translation work

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:06.189
that's being accomplished around the world

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:10.189
at present we have three project teams

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:13.990
so a project team is made of three translators

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.990
waking together and in December of 2014

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.589
they move to these beautiful facilities that will be dedicated today

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:26.790
the translation office is brought closer to you so that we can have a share

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.790
also in making sure the publications are available

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.589
to accomplish this translation work

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:37.790
we need remote translation offices all over the world

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.790
is it your desire brothers and sisters that we should

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:47.790
dedicate this remote translation office to the worship and praise of our God Jehovah

00:05:47.790 --> 00:06:24.449
the governing body has approved my addressing something that Jesus himself spoke of

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:26.449
on a number of occasions

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:28.649
and I might say at the outset

00:06:28.649 --> 00:06:33.449
this is by no means a pessimistic speech meant to discourage anyone

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:38.449
it is a realistic discussion that we all need to be prepared for

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:41.449
the topic is persecution

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:47.850
it can come in many forms some are very subtle means to discourage a servant of God

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:51.449
others are more direct forms of opposition

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:56.959
but not unexpected

00:06:56.959 --> 00:07:01.959
the Apostle Paul in the first century CE described certain men

00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:05.160
who oppose the early Christian congregation

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:10.160
he reminded loyal followers of Jesus about the persecutions and sufferings

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.160
he experienced in multiple cities

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.759
his follow-up words in 2nd Timothy 312

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:20.160
are the theme for this material

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:26.360
here Paul shows that persecution would not be the experience of just a select few

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.360
he said in 2nd Timothy 312

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.160
in fact all

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.360
yes all

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:38.160
those designed to live with godly devotion and association with Christ Jesus

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.959
will also be persecuted

00:07:41.959 --> 00:07:48.160
while we don't want to become unduly disturbed about what we might or might not face in the future

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.959
at the same time

00:07:49.959 --> 00:07:59.589
we don't want to be unprepared when opposition suddenly rears its ugly head

00:07:59.589 --> 00:08:04.790
Jesus openly discussed the possibility of persecution with his disciples

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:09.389
one classic example of that is found at John 1520

00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:10.790
and 21

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:22.019
if you have your biblied hand please open to John 1520 and 21

00:08:22.019 --> 00:08:24.420
he said

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.019
keep in mind the word I said to you

00:08:27.019 --> 00:08:30.220
a slave is not greater than his master

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:35.419
if they have persecuted me they will also persecute you

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:39.419
if they have observed my word they will also observe yours

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:42.419
but they will do all these things against you

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:49.820
on account of my name because they do not know the one who sent me

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:54.419
it's difficult to misconstrue those words isn't it

00:08:54.419 --> 00:08:59.419
Jesus said persecution is going to happen

00:08:59.419 --> 00:09:03.419
therefore we need to be prepared

00:09:03.419 --> 00:09:07.820
what are some forms of persecution we might expect

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:12.620
as mentioned it could be subtle forms such as negative talk about our beliefs

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:17.620
or sarcastic comments by schoolmates or workmates

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:22.820
however Jesus himself itemized more alt-right forms of persecution

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:30.320
at Luke 21 12 through 19 find Luke 21

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.480
12 through 19

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:40.480
we might mention that here Jesus was not referring to what would happen back then

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.279
in the first century

00:09:42.279 --> 00:09:45.679
this was a prophecy about the future

00:09:45.679 --> 00:09:48.879
he was describing what would transpire now

00:09:48.879 --> 00:09:52.879
before the end of the evil system under Satan's control

00:09:52.879 --> 00:09:57.879
so we expect to see an increase in such malicious opposition

00:09:57.879 --> 00:09:59.879
it is in that context

00:09:59.879 --> 00:10:04.279
that Jesus warns us of four different kinds of persecution

00:10:04.279 --> 00:10:08.080
originating from various sources

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:12.279
Luke 21 starting in verse 12

00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:18.480
but before all these things happen people will lay their hands on you and persecute you

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.879
handing you over to the synagogues and prisons

00:10:21.879 --> 00:10:27.279
you'll be brought before kings and governors for the sake of my name

00:10:27.279 --> 00:10:32.679
skip down to verses 16 and 17

00:10:32.679 --> 00:10:39.679
moreover you'll be handed over even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends

00:10:39.679 --> 00:10:42.080
and they'll put some of you to death

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:48.080
and you'll be hated by all people because of my name

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:52.279
family persecution is sometimes the most heart-wrenching

00:10:52.279 --> 00:10:55.779
because of natural familial ties that exist

00:10:55.779 --> 00:10:58.580
but did you notice in verse 12

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:02.779
Jesus said some would be handed over to prisons

00:11:02.779 --> 00:11:08.179
that has been the situation for many of our brothers and pre-Christian and Christian times

00:11:08.179 --> 00:11:09.779
for example

00:11:09.779 --> 00:11:12.580
in the April broadcasting program

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:18.379
brother sannerson reviewed the situation faced by our young brothers in Korea

00:11:18.379 --> 00:11:22.580
the RN and out of prison because of their neutral stand

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:27.179
what marvelous examples for any of us who come face to face

00:11:27.179 --> 00:11:32.179
with the same treatment because of changing religious or political wins

00:11:32.179 --> 00:11:36.179
we came across an archive video of another faithful brother

00:11:36.179 --> 00:11:40.279
who endured four and a half years in prison in China

00:11:40.279 --> 00:11:43.080
this is an interview from the past with brother

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:47.059
Harold King

00:11:47.059 --> 00:11:51.259
I saw a policeman coming into the lane and they were

00:11:51.259 --> 00:11:57.460
as if they were facing a machine gun attack or something they were creeping along the wall on the other side

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:59.960
and running up into the lane

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:03.860
and so I said Stanley someone going to get picked up this morning

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.259
look at the police are in the lane

00:12:06.259 --> 00:12:08.259
because we've been seeing this quite often

00:12:08.259 --> 00:12:10.860
they were picking up people all over the city

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:14.059
so what we did

00:12:14.059 --> 00:12:19.860
we were just going to get on with our breakfast anyway

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.460
when bang bang bang on our back door

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:26.860
and I said Stanley it's us there after us a small

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.659
but we couldn't they couldn't find anything

00:12:29.659 --> 00:12:33.460
they did take the files because we'd hidden nothing

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:40.159
and the thing is we didn't have to worry too much because they had to spy in the congregation

00:12:40.159 --> 00:12:44.960
they gave them all the information they wanted before they came and arrested us

00:12:45.059 --> 00:12:50.860
that fellow was originally my Bible study when he was a university student

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:55.059
I thought what a dirty little rotter that fellow turned out to be

00:12:55.059 --> 00:12:58.159
and I looked straight at his face

00:12:58.159 --> 00:13:01.659
and he wouldn't look at mine he hung his head

00:13:01.659 --> 00:13:05.960
the magistrate says what do you know this man?

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:09.159
and he said yes he was my teacher

00:13:09.159 --> 00:13:10.759
what did he teach you?

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:15.860
he taught me that the Chinese people's government was of the devil

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:19.059
and that it was going to be destroyed

00:13:19.059 --> 00:13:24.559
and all who supported would be destroyed along with it

00:13:24.559 --> 00:13:27.759
he said to me that what you taught him

00:13:27.759 --> 00:13:32.059
I said well I'd like to qualify that

00:13:32.059 --> 00:13:34.759
I sat there on the floor I had no bed

00:13:34.759 --> 00:13:38.059
I had no chair I'd only got a concrete floor

00:13:38.059 --> 00:13:40.960
I'd got a room four and a half by nine

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.759
and all I was in the corner was a bucket like that

00:13:43.759 --> 00:13:46.759
I wouldn't bucket it that with the bands around it

00:13:46.759 --> 00:13:48.759
that was my restroom

00:13:48.759 --> 00:13:52.759
and the situation was full

00:13:52.759 --> 00:13:54.759
the cell was full of urban

00:13:54.759 --> 00:13:57.960
they got bugs bed bugs crawling in there

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.860
and I was bitten all over

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.659
I hadn't had any food since that breakfast

00:14:02.659 --> 00:14:07.759
and here it was now I wasn't going to get any of that night

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.860
I used my time in the cell

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:13.559
I wasn't going to sit there on the floor full of self pity

00:14:13.559 --> 00:14:15.559
I was going to go preaching

00:14:15.559 --> 00:14:19.059
if they wouldn't let me do anything I could do something

00:14:19.059 --> 00:14:21.759
I could practice my presentations

00:14:21.759 --> 00:14:25.559
so each corner of the cell became a door

00:14:25.559 --> 00:14:29.960
and I would start off and go to this door and witness

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:33.159
and I made it quite real from experiences that I had

00:14:33.159 --> 00:14:35.659
not every corner was interested

00:14:35.659 --> 00:14:40.159
this one was very interested and this one turned out to be a return visit

00:14:40.159 --> 00:14:43.460
and a Bible study and I got a Bible study

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:46.960
going I didn't turn in a field service report

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:50.960
but it kept my mind on the scriptures

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.460
and I had no other way of doing that

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.159
I could have compromised

00:14:56.159 --> 00:15:00.059
they told me you see they wouldn't let me cut my hair

00:15:00.059 --> 00:15:01.559
they wouldn't let me shave

00:15:01.559 --> 00:15:03.960
they wouldn't let me pair my nails

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:08.759
and I couldn't get proper exercise

00:15:08.759 --> 00:15:13.759
and they kept saying if you will only confess that you're spies

00:15:13.759 --> 00:15:16.259
no I would that would be betrayal

00:15:16.259 --> 00:15:20.559
and that was the last thing I wanted to do

00:15:20.559 --> 00:15:23.259
I had a lovely relationship with Jehovah God

00:15:23.259 --> 00:15:25.159
I loved him very dearly

00:15:25.159 --> 00:15:27.659
he was real he wasn't fictitious

00:15:27.659 --> 00:15:30.860
and the whole organization the angels

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:35.259
and all the fine work of Paul James Peter John

00:15:35.259 --> 00:15:38.259
the earnestness for which they kept the work going

00:15:38.259 --> 00:15:41.159
it was my privilege to do that now

00:15:41.159 --> 00:15:43.960
and they were my examples and I followed them

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:50.159
so never at any time did I think of trying to find an easy way out

00:15:50.159 --> 00:15:53.159
well I prayed to Jehovah then and I said Jehovah

00:15:53.159 --> 00:15:57.360
I wanted to be able to celebrate the memorial with my brothers outside

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:04.860
so could I see the moon on that night

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:07.860
and if it wasn't the full moon

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:10.860
I don't let me see it

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:13.860
well there were cloudy nights and there were bright nights

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:17.860
but this particular night on that first nice and 14

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.360
there wasn't a question about it

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:24.860
it seemed almost as if Jehovah had polished up that morning

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:30.159
and then I gave the memorial talk to an imaginary kingdom

00:16:30.159 --> 00:16:32.460
awful of brothers

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:37.960
and I gave it through when I came to the point of passing the emblems

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.460
I would just ask Jehovah's blessing on the bread

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:45.960
and I'd pick up the saucer and make a pretence of passing it

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.860
around and bringing it back and making a pretence

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:51.159
of taking a piece myself

00:16:51.159 --> 00:16:52.559
and then I'd put it down

00:16:52.559 --> 00:16:55.559
and I would ask Jehovah's blessing on the cup

00:16:55.559 --> 00:16:59.259
and do the same at my normal bug and say that

00:16:59.259 --> 00:17:02.059
and then come back and make the pretence of drinking it

00:17:02.059 --> 00:17:05.700
and pray Jehovah would accept that

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:09.200
I don't like the word depress because I never was depressed

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:15.200
but there were days when I felt things could go a little better than they were going

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:19.700
so I thought something like this

00:17:19.799 --> 00:17:27.700
Oh come all you slaves of Jehovah on high who've given your heart to your God

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:32.500
out to the work you've been given to do in the footsteps

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.000
that Jesus Christ brought

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.500
and then that song came

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.500
and I used to get better

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:46.829
and the very fact of singing that song lifted me up out of the low spell

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:49.329
I was exalted

00:17:49.329 --> 00:17:56.329
I was accelerated in realizing that just across the other side of the bridge

00:17:56.329 --> 00:17:59.829
for the British Consulate General with my passport

00:17:59.829 --> 00:18:03.130
and outside there were a team of brothers

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:05.829
that had come up and meet me from the branch

00:18:05.829 --> 00:18:07.130
and I would be with him again

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:16.529
I was emotionally almost weeping with the joy of being among them again

00:18:16.529 --> 00:18:19.529
we just got bear hugs all around

00:18:19.529 --> 00:18:22.329
and they were so happy

00:18:22.329 --> 00:18:26.130
and all the way home

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:28.630
they were asking questions how it wasn't

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:30.130
I was able to talk to them

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:32.430
and by the time I did get down there

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:34.630
I was getting a bit horse

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:36.630
because I'd been talking

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:39.529
and I was so sort of

00:18:39.529 --> 00:18:42.529
wound up time being free again

00:18:42.529 --> 00:18:45.430
and I was taking everything in as I

00:18:45.529 --> 00:18:49.430
as I went along and I realized the beauty of Hong Kong at that time

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:53.480
and the work and that was being done there

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:58.680
faith is based on accurate knowledge

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:03.480
and there's the only accurate knowledge available regarding

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.980
the purpose of creation

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:10.079
is that contained in the Bible

00:19:10.079 --> 00:19:12.279
so it is the case

00:19:12.279 --> 00:19:14.180
I would say a new one

00:19:14.279 --> 00:19:16.980
now I'm telling the brothers everywhere

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.779
get that Bible off its printed page

00:19:19.779 --> 00:19:21.779
and get it into your heart

00:19:21.779 --> 00:19:23.180
and then you got it

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:24.980
and it's a living word

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:27.779
and it will keep you strong in the faith

00:19:27.779 --> 00:19:29.779
where else can you go?

00:19:29.779 --> 00:19:32.980
There's look at the world of state that it's in today

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:36.880
there's no haven anywhere in this world

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:43.859
but there's a wonderful haven among your hopeless people

00:19:43.859 --> 00:19:46.859
Brother King endured the persecution

00:19:46.859 --> 00:19:52.460
he was later released and since his death in January of 1993

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:53.960
we are confident

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:58.359
he is ruling as a king with Jesus in heaven

00:19:58.359 --> 00:20:01.160
was his endurance worth the sacrifice?

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.859
Absolutely

00:20:03.859 --> 00:20:09.160
what is another form of persecution that Jesus specifically mentioned

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:14.160
at Matthew 5.11 he said that people will persecute you and lying

00:20:14.259 --> 00:20:19.160
and say every sort of wicked thing against you for my sake

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.160
lies are particularly hurtful

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:27.759
because they misrepresent the true nature of a person or organization

00:20:27.759 --> 00:20:31.160
they are often started with malicious intent

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:35.759
then they might be picked up by the news media and published as if factual

00:20:35.759 --> 00:20:40.160
when in reality many of the facts never come to light

00:20:40.259 --> 00:20:44.759
Jesus indicated that no matter what his followers did

00:20:44.759 --> 00:20:51.359
they would be criticized and misrepresented by people who speak untruths

00:20:51.359 --> 00:20:56.859
as an example at Matthew 11.18 he said of John the Baptist

00:20:56.859 --> 00:21:01.759
he came neither eating nor drinking but people say he has a demon

00:21:01.759 --> 00:21:03.960
then in the next verse

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.460
Matthew 11.19

00:21:06.559 --> 00:21:12.259
Jesus commented on his own very different approach to the basics of life

00:21:12.259 --> 00:21:16.759
Jesus did not follow the strict dietary restrictions of John

00:21:16.759 --> 00:21:20.359
Jesus was also known to drink wine and moderation

00:21:20.359 --> 00:21:25.160
the opposite approach of John who was criticized for his behavior

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:28.960
what lying accusations to Jesus have to face

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:35.079
Matthew 11.19 says

00:21:35.079 --> 00:21:37.980
the son of man did come eating and drinking

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:41.579
but people say look a man who is a glutton

00:21:41.579 --> 00:21:47.579
and is given to drinking wine a friend of tax collectors and sinners

00:21:47.579 --> 00:21:49.579
as in the first century

00:21:49.579 --> 00:21:53.380
we are criticized by something no matter what we do

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:58.079
but notice the significant comment of Jesus at the end of that verse

00:21:58.079 --> 00:21:59.380
he said

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:00.980
all the same

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:06.380
wisdom is proved righteous by its works

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:08.079
in other words

00:22:08.079 --> 00:22:14.579
people in general can usually see right through the exaggerated stories and outright lies

00:22:14.579 --> 00:22:24.180
they know our good motives and good works and our true reputation remains intact

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:27.980
while we may take advantage of legal means to set the record straight

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:33.380
and harming with Jesus words we do not engage in smear campaigns with rebuttals

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:36.380
either verbally or in print

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:42.279
instead we continue to go about our peaceful work for the good of humanity

00:22:42.279 --> 00:22:46.980
this includes sharing the Bible's message with all people helping them to

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:50.579
better their lives spiritually and morally

00:22:50.579 --> 00:22:54.779
we translate that message in some 700 languages

00:22:54.779 --> 00:22:58.180
some of which we've never even heard of before

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:03.980
we go to great lengths to help the blind in the death with publications they can comprehend

00:23:04.079 --> 00:23:08.180
even though these are produced at significant cost

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:09.180
in fact

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:15.079
we produce video publications in some 80 different sign languages

00:23:15.079 --> 00:23:16.980
Jesus was right

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:22.079
wisdom is proved righteous by its works

00:23:22.079 --> 00:23:29.380
but what are some of the erroneous ideas that are seized upon and at times publicized by the media

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:36.279
some municipalities misinterpret our intent and spread lies about the nature of our public ministry

00:23:36.279 --> 00:23:41.579
commendably however in many lands the law supports our freedom of speech and worship

00:23:41.579 --> 00:23:47.779
and our persistence is actually set a precedent for others to enjoy similar freedoms

00:23:47.779 --> 00:23:53.180
at times lies are spread about our view of medical intervention when sick

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:54.579
for example

00:23:54.680 --> 00:24:00.579
reports are circulated that we let our children die rather than seeking medical help for them

00:24:00.579 --> 00:24:03.880
nothing could be further from the truth

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:09.180
instead an isolated incident is blown out of proportion

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:12.680
then emotion and drama are added as fuel

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:15.680
and then this is fed to the press

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:18.980
the impression circulated is so inaccurate

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:22.980
that it could only be labeled a bold face lie

00:24:23.079 --> 00:24:28.180
we want the best possible medical care for our children

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:38.579
of course we leave it up to the parents to determine what type of treatment will best care for their child's health condition

00:24:38.579 --> 00:24:41.079
as we've just discussed

00:24:41.079 --> 00:24:44.279
persecution can come in many forms

00:24:44.279 --> 00:24:49.279
we do not need to try to imagine the various forms that it might take in the future

00:24:49.279 --> 00:24:50.779
however

00:24:50.779 --> 00:24:55.079
to cope successfully with whatever might come our way

00:24:55.079 --> 00:24:57.980
we need to be aware of the possibility

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:01.380
that is what our program is highlighting this month

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:05.279
we are grateful that Jehovah has forewarned us in his word

00:25:05.279 --> 00:25:09.680
and that Jesus made such pointed observations on the subject

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:15.480
please locate with me Isaiah 28 verse 16

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:19.279
the apostle Peter first Peter 2 6 under inspiration

00:25:19.279 --> 00:25:24.180
made clear that this ancient prophecy pointed forward to Jesus

00:25:24.279 --> 00:25:29.380
would become the cornerstone and foundation of the Christian congregation

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:36.779
if we exercise full faith in Jesus what will be our attitude and resolve regarding future opposition

00:25:36.779 --> 00:25:40.680
read with me Isaiah 28 16

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:43.700
therefore this is what the sovereign

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:46.279
Jehovah Lord Jehovah says

00:25:46.279 --> 00:25:50.779
here I am laying as a foundation and Zion attested stone

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:54.380
the precious cornerstone of a sure foundation

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:58.880
no one exercising faith will panic

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.079
how reassuring

00:26:01.079 --> 00:26:03.680
Jesus is a solid foundation

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:07.680
giving us stability no matter what we might face now

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:12.579
or in the future there is no need to panic

00:26:12.579 --> 00:26:17.480
in fact when considering the secure solid foundation of the Christ

00:26:17.579 --> 00:26:21.880
please note the strength we derive from his example

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.380
as said fourth in Ephesians 3

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:27.680
16 through 21

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:31.680
even if we are timid by nature these verses make clear that

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:35.579
we can be made mighty in the person we are inside

00:26:35.579 --> 00:26:37.380
how

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:40.279
by having the Christ dwell in our hearts

00:26:40.279 --> 00:26:44.680
notice how beautifully this inspired point is made at Ephesians

00:26:44.779 --> 00:26:48.880
chapter 3 starting in verse 16

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:53.279
I pray that he may grant you through the abundance of his glory to be made mighty

00:26:53.279 --> 00:26:55.279
in the man you are inside

00:26:55.279 --> 00:26:57.279
with power through his spirit

00:26:57.279 --> 00:27:01.279
and that through your faith you may have the Christ dwell in your hearts

00:27:01.279 --> 00:27:04.380
with love

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:10.579
and what kind of stability will embedding Jesus disposition into our heart providers

00:27:10.579 --> 00:27:13.079
that verse continues

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:17.180
may you be rooted into established in the foundation

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:22.680
in order that with all the holy ones you may be thoroughly able to comprehend fully

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:28.480
what is the breadth and length and height and depth

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:32.779
our spiritual peripheral vision will be enhanced

00:27:32.779 --> 00:27:36.180
we will comprehend more fully our circumstances

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:42.180
better than we could have had we relied simply on our own imperfect perspective

00:27:42.279 --> 00:27:47.279
and what about being able to endure any persecution that comes our way

00:27:47.279 --> 00:27:50.279
we absolutely can

00:27:50.279 --> 00:27:53.279
but not by our own strength

00:27:53.279 --> 00:27:58.079
read with me now verses 20 and 21

00:27:58.079 --> 00:28:02.480
now to the one who can according to his power that is operating in us

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:08.079
do more than super abundantly beyond all the things we ask or conceive

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:12.680
to him be the glory by means of the congregation and by means of Christ Jesus

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:15.279
12 generations forever and ever

00:28:15.279 --> 00:28:17.890
amen

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:19.390
we echo

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:24.990
amen to those insightful and strengthening words from our God

00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:30.990
for him to do super abundantly beyond what we need is special indeed

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:38.990
but did you notice it said he will do more than super abundantly beyond all the things we ask

00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:40.990
and that is why

00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:45.990
ordinary people very much like you and I have endured extraordinary opposition

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:49.789
and have come through on Jehovah's side of the issue

00:28:49.789 --> 00:28:55.190
for all of you integrity keepers to Jehovah be the glory by means of Christ Jesus

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:58.589
to all generations forever and ever

00:28:58.589 --> 00:29:02.140
amen

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:07.440
we now like to share with you two examples of individuals who have faithfully

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:11.839
continued to serve Jehovah despite persecution

00:29:11.839 --> 00:29:16.240
in both cases the opposition came from within the family

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:19.339
first we'd like you to meet I know her

00:29:19.339 --> 00:29:24.440
she's a single sister who face persecution for an extended period of time

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:30.039
but today she has truly lived up to the word stated in Psalm 68-11

00:29:30.039 --> 00:29:32.039
Jehovah gives the command

00:29:32.039 --> 00:29:39.160
the women proclaiming the good news are a large army

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:42.359
I was born in Kazakhstan

00:29:42.359 --> 00:29:45.259
when I was 14 years old

00:29:45.259 --> 00:29:49.660
we moved to the country of my family

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:55.160
and people there are very prejudice they don't like when somebody

00:29:55.160 --> 00:30:02.079
chose his own way of living

00:30:02.079 --> 00:30:03.880
when I was 18

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:07.779
a classmate told me about Armageddon

00:30:07.779 --> 00:30:10.279
I was frightened a little bit

00:30:10.279 --> 00:30:12.279
in the beginning

00:30:12.279 --> 00:30:15.279
but I wanted to learn more

00:30:15.279 --> 00:30:19.279
and I started to read publications of Jehovah's Witnesses

00:30:19.279 --> 00:30:22.279
that she gave me

00:30:22.279 --> 00:30:26.079
and from the beginning I realized that

00:30:26.079 --> 00:30:30.579
I found people that I was looking for

00:30:30.579 --> 00:30:32.680
people without prejudice

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.680
without pride

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.680
different nationalities

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:39.279
but living in different countries

00:30:39.279 --> 00:30:46.279
and that was like taking a deep breath of hope

00:30:46.279 --> 00:30:50.279
but my family was not very happy

00:30:50.279 --> 00:31:04.099
so several times when I tried to read Bible at home

00:31:04.099 --> 00:31:09.099
but hiding in the corner or somewhere

00:31:09.099 --> 00:31:14.440
they didn't want me to go to the meetings

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:17.440
even to keep in touch with my friends

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:20.440
with no one

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:23.440
so they kept me at home

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:25.440
for several months

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:30.490
because of this I had to

00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:33.490
keep in secret my going to the meetings

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:35.490
well I was very scared

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:47.579
they want me to be like other people

00:31:47.579 --> 00:31:51.579
they throw away all my literature

00:31:51.579 --> 00:32:13.950
and they burned my Bible

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:16.950
my friends told me about the love they saw

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:18.950
at the conventions

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:21.950
so I wanted to experience this

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:26.950
but I knew that my family would never allow me to go there

00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:29.950
so I wrote a letter

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:35.950
and left knowing what would happen when I come home

00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:38.950
but a brother at the convention

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:41.950
he told me if I give up

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:43.950
my family would never

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:45.950
had any chance to come to the truth

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:50.490
over the next several years

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:52.490
persecution got even worse

00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:55.490
although I was baptized

00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:57.490
and pioneering

00:32:57.490 --> 00:33:00.490
I felt that I couldn't make any

00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:03.490
spiritual progress anymore

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:06.490
the stress affected my health

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:09.490
creating rush over my skin

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:16.420
there were days

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:20.420
when I wanted to close my eyes

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:22.420
and never wake up

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:27.819
but Jehovah did not forget about me

00:33:27.819 --> 00:33:29.819
when I thought that I had no strength

00:33:29.819 --> 00:33:32.819
to continue to grow spiritually

00:33:32.819 --> 00:33:35.819
I got an assignment in special full-time service

00:33:35.819 --> 00:33:38.819
as if Jehovah reached in

00:33:38.819 --> 00:33:40.819
put his arms around me

00:33:40.819 --> 00:33:43.819
and pulled out of my circumstances

00:33:43.819 --> 00:33:46.819
and he gave me freedom

00:33:46.819 --> 00:33:50.819
I was like a bird

00:33:50.819 --> 00:33:52.819
I had no fear anymore

00:33:52.819 --> 00:33:54.819
and could serve Jehovah freely

00:33:54.819 --> 00:33:56.819
as I wanted to

00:33:56.819 --> 00:34:00.819
I could freely go to the meetings

00:34:00.819 --> 00:34:04.819
I could read literature

00:34:04.819 --> 00:34:06.819
publication at home

00:34:06.819 --> 00:34:09.820
I could go to the service

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:12.820
without fearing what can happen

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:14.820
when I come back

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:18.820
and I could go to the conventions

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:20.820
Jehovah gave me

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:25.139
blessing that I'd never thought about

00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:28.139
to be a student

00:34:28.139 --> 00:34:31.139
of the 100 to the 8 class of Gilead

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:34.139
and now I'm here

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:38.090
and for all single sisters

00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:40.090
I would like to say that Jehovah

00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:43.090
never forgets every little thing

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:44.090
that you do for him

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:47.090
he will help you to progress

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:50.090
he can use anybody

00:34:50.090 --> 00:35:05.570
anywhere to do his will

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:08.570
I still do things by myself

00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:20.659
but with Jehovah, I'm not alone

00:35:20.659 --> 00:35:23.659
Truly, I know that is a good example

00:35:23.659 --> 00:35:26.659
for all our dear single sisters

00:35:26.659 --> 00:35:28.659
Let's now travel to the

00:35:28.659 --> 00:35:29.659
island in Japan

00:35:29.659 --> 00:35:30.659
and meet sister

00:35:30.659 --> 00:35:32.659
Kimiko Nakagoa

00:35:32.659 --> 00:35:34.659
She's a prime example

00:35:34.659 --> 00:35:36.659
of the words in 1st Peter 3

00:35:36.659 --> 00:35:37.659
1 that reads

00:35:37.659 --> 00:35:39.659
In the same way, you wives

00:35:39.659 --> 00:35:41.659
be in subjection to your husband

00:35:41.659 --> 00:35:43.659
so that if any are not

00:35:43.659 --> 00:35:44.659
obedient to the word

00:35:44.659 --> 00:35:47.659
they may be one without a word

00:35:47.659 --> 00:35:49.659
through the conduct of their wives

00:35:49.659 --> 00:35:51.659
Sister Nakagoa's

00:35:51.659 --> 00:35:54.659
complete trust in this divine principle

00:35:54.659 --> 00:35:55.659
shows what can come

00:35:55.659 --> 00:35:56.659
as a result of enduring

00:35:56.659 --> 00:36:02.570
persecution within the family

00:36:02.570 --> 00:36:04.570
The Saul of Saddo

00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:08.570
That is what my husband was called

00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:10.570
He seriously considered

00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:12.570
having all the witnesses

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:14.570
expelled from this island

00:36:14.570 --> 00:36:19.420
He was even planning to purchase an island

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:26.710
and have them move there

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:29.710
If he learned the witnesses were preaching in Saddo

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:32.710
he immediately set out to stop them

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:59.650
and possibly took our brother to the sea shore

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:02.650
Even so, I never considered

00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:05.539
giving up

00:37:05.539 --> 00:37:08.539
Eventually, he decided to divorce me

00:37:08.539 --> 00:37:12.420
He told the children

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:15.420
choose who do you want to live with

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:17.420
your mother or me

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:21.929
I gave our children

00:37:21.929 --> 00:37:23.929
whatever they wanted

00:37:23.929 --> 00:37:25.929
but my wife gave them

00:37:25.929 --> 00:37:27.929
the rod of discipline

00:37:27.929 --> 00:37:30.929
They all made the same choice

00:37:30.929 --> 00:37:35.360
They chose me

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:43.269
I was 100% sure that they would choose me

00:37:43.269 --> 00:37:46.269
but they chose my wife

00:37:46.269 --> 00:37:49.269
They chose the rod over money

00:37:49.269 --> 00:37:51.269
Why?

00:37:51.269 --> 00:37:52.269
How come?

00:37:52.269 --> 00:37:55.269
It was a mystery

00:37:55.269 --> 00:37:57.269
So I didn't divorce her

00:37:57.269 --> 00:37:59.269
but looked into the Bible instead

00:37:59.269 --> 00:38:04.800
She gradually made spiritual progress

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.800
joined the ministry school

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.800
and received his first assignment

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:13.139
but then he got a phone call

00:38:13.139 --> 00:38:16.139
from the Minister of Agriculture

00:38:16.139 --> 00:38:21.139
and was invited to come up to Congress to make a report

00:38:21.139 --> 00:38:25.139
It was just on the day of his assignment

00:38:25.139 --> 00:38:29.989
This is quite an honor

00:38:29.989 --> 00:38:31.989
so I planned to give the report

00:38:31.989 --> 00:38:33.989
to the Congress' priority

00:38:33.989 --> 00:38:36.989
and refused the assignment on the school

00:38:36.989 --> 00:38:38.989
But that morning

00:38:38.989 --> 00:38:44.550
I found a letter on the shoebox

00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:46.550
It was from the children

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:48.550
It said

00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:53.500
we are all looking forward to Daddy's talk

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.500
I thought to myself

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:57.500
which is more valuable

00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:59.500
giving a speech before Congress

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:01.500
or a talk before my family

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:03.500
who are looking forward to it so much

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:08.860
I called the Minister

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.860
and turned down his offer

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:12.860
It ruined my relationship

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:14.860
of cooperation with the politician

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:16.860
but I thought that the bond

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:19.860
with my family was more valuable

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:26.570
When I think about it

00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:28.570
it was a tireless love, care

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:30.570
and respect my family showed

00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:33.570
that won me over

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:35.570
Since I always came home late from work

00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:37.570
my wife and children made

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:40.570
message notebooks

00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:42.570
in order to keep good communication

00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:46.780
with me

00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:48.780
to our kind daddy

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:50.780
Welcome home

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:52.780
Tomorrow you have to go far

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:54.780
It must be hard

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:58.500
Please take care

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:02.500
Our greatest hope is that you study the Bible soon

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:10.360
They are so caring and affectionate

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:14.360
I just did what I thought I ought to

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.360
From the beginning

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:18.360
I was confident that my husband

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:20.360
would become a Jehovah's Witness

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:23.360
and Jehovah would never abandon

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:26.360
such a pure and gentle man

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:30.789
Isn't it only natural

00:40:30.789 --> 00:40:32.789
that I would want to show love

00:40:32.789 --> 00:40:36.789
and respect to win over such a man?

00:40:36.789 --> 00:40:46.230
Now just as our children dream

00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:49.230
we are praising Jehovah as a family

00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:53.510
and I am enjoying pioneering with my wife

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:56.510
Our children have expanded their ministry

00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:59.510
to serve in countries where the need is greater

00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:06.030
We are enjoying Jehovah's Blessings

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:16.090
My husband was called the Saul of Sado

00:41:16.090 --> 00:41:18.090
But now

00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:22.090
in this island where he tried to expel Jehovah's Witnesses

00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:24.090
he loves Christian friends

00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:28.090
and zealously preaches the Bible truth

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:31.090
I am so thankful to Jehovah

00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:38.530
The Saul of Sado has become a pioneer in Sado

00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:48.579
Sister Nakagawa endured opposition for 10 years

00:41:48.579 --> 00:41:51.579
before her husband embraced the truth

00:41:51.579 --> 00:41:54.579
But despite the challenges at home

00:41:54.579 --> 00:41:58.579
her circumstances allowed her to serve as a regular pioneer

00:41:58.579 --> 00:42:01.579
Therefore it came as no surprise to me

00:42:01.579 --> 00:42:06.579
to hear that she's now been in full-time service for almost 40 years

00:42:06.579 --> 00:42:10.579
Although her husband Katsuo was once closely associated

00:42:10.579 --> 00:42:13.579
with highly ranked government officials

00:42:13.579 --> 00:42:18.579
he now supports his family mowing public lawns

00:42:18.579 --> 00:42:23.579
simplifying his life has allowed him to join his wife as a regular pioneer

00:42:23.579 --> 00:42:28.579
He also serves as an elder in the local congregation

00:42:28.579 --> 00:42:35.170
The governing body has also asked me to address

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:39.170
another topic that I must say hits close to my heart

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:42.170
being a father who raised two boys

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:45.170
The subject is the abuse of children

00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:50.170
and the damaging effects this can have on such innocent victims

00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:52.170
As an organization

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:55.170
we view all such abuse of children

00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:59.170
whether physical, sexual or emotional as deplorable

00:42:59.170 --> 00:43:01.170
As you likely know

00:43:01.170 --> 00:43:05.170
Jehovah's Witnesses take a stronger position than most

00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:10.170
on the scriptural and appropriateness of any form of immorality

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:12.170
However

00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:18.170
to take advantage of innocent young ones is absolutely despicable

00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:21.170
As a religious organization

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:26.170
we have taken a decisive stand against such behavior

00:43:26.170 --> 00:43:32.170
It is our fervent desire to protect children from any kind of abuse

00:43:32.170 --> 00:43:35.170
Our policy as an organization

00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:39.170
is that one professing to be a victim or his parents

00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:43.170
should never be discouraged from reporting the incident

00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:46.170
to the appropriate authorities

00:43:46.170 --> 00:43:49.170
While child abuse has been perpetrated

00:43:49.170 --> 00:43:52.170
Earthwide in many cultures for thousands of years

00:43:52.170 --> 00:43:55.170
it has only in the past 40 years or so

00:43:55.170 --> 00:44:00.170
that the magnitude and the extent of the problem has become better known

00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:05.170
This is because governmental agencies are now determined to

00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:08.170
take a more active interest in this problem

00:44:08.170 --> 00:44:11.170
Laws were enacted requiring medical

00:44:11.170 --> 00:44:14.170
and other professionals to report cases to the authorities

00:44:14.170 --> 00:44:17.170
when they became aware of them

00:44:17.170 --> 00:44:19.170
Prior to that time

00:44:19.170 --> 00:44:23.170
many governmental, educational and religious organizations

00:44:23.170 --> 00:44:29.170
were somewhat naive about the magnitude and the complexity of the situation

00:44:29.170 --> 00:44:32.170
Others knew of the problem and covered it up

00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:37.170
What has our position been as an organization?

00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:43.170
When what was termed as the new morality became popular over 50 years ago

00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:47.170
which included sexual relations among young ones

00:44:47.170 --> 00:44:54.170
We condemned such behavior based on the Bibles unhearing and timeless principles

00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:58.170
As the awareness of child abuse became more and more known

00:44:58.170 --> 00:45:03.170
We published a landmark of Wake magazine over 30 years ago

00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:08.170
It was the issue of June 22, 1982

00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:15.170
There are five article titles that nailed the subject in a very straightforward manner

00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:19.170
The first article was entitled The New Morality

00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:23.170
Then Chickens and Hawks was the second article

00:45:23.170 --> 00:45:27.170
It warned about homosexual men who prey on

00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:31.170
and advocate the right to use boys for sex

00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:33.170
Shame on them

00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:38.170
The next article, baby pros and kitty porn

00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:44.170
Condent prostitute rings that employed small girls in an array of abuse

00:45:44.170 --> 00:45:46.170
Then rape at home

00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:49.170
No further explanation needed on that

00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:52.170
And finally the article

00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:55.170
To end child abuse

00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:58.170
I remembered this magazine well

00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:03.170
Since I had two boys who were in elementary school at the time

00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:09.170
And again remember that the world in general was still somewhat naive about the magnitude of this issue

00:46:09.170 --> 00:46:12.170
and the gravity of the problem

00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:14.170
I read the five articles

00:46:14.170 --> 00:46:17.170
Then I looked at my two boys

00:46:17.170 --> 00:46:21.170
and I set a predator of them thanking him

00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:26.170
for moving the organization to be so proactive in trying to help parents

00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:33.170
to protect their young ones from the plague of the new morality in the abuse of children

00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:41.980
This issue has been straightforwardly addressed in print many times since then

00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:44.980
I now like you to view a PSA

00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:46.980
What is a PSA?

00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:50.980
It stands for public service announcement

00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:55.980
It is a message of public interest which is aired by the media without charge

00:46:55.980 --> 00:47:02.980
The objective is to raise awareness about changing public attitudes and behavior towards a social issue

00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:09.980
Television stations are not obligated to play all such 30 to 60 second messages provided

00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:19.980
However, if the topic and production value captures their attention they can choose to air a PSA for the benefit of the viewing audience

00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:26.980
In the late 1990s the governing body approved four PSAs on the subject of family life

00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:32.980
I'd like to show you one of these that was produced back in 2002

00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:37.980
It was picked up and aired by some of the largest TV networks in the United States

00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:44.980
Why? Because they realized this type of warning was important for their viewing audience to see

00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:51.980
It is true the type of computer equipment shown in the video dates it however

00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:58.980
The message is just as pertinent now as then and maybe even more so please watch

00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:05.980
He understands you and makes you feel special

00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:20.260
He knows everything you're interested in he's your best friend and always there when you need him

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:50.280
He seems too good to be true he is parents protect your children and most of all give your children knowledge

00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:59.420
Wisdom and thinking ability love builds happy families

00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:11.420
While we cannot control everything that an individual might say it is clear that over the decades protecting children from abuse is a top priority for this organization

00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:15.420
We are proud of our reputation in this regard

00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:24.420
And we look forward to the time in God's new world when no one young or old will ever again be a victim of abuse

00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:31.420
Since the latter part of our discussion has addressed what Jehovah's organization has done to protect children from predators

00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:39.420
It gives me great pleasure to release it this time another animated video in the series become Jehovah's friend

00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:43.420
It is entitled protect your children

00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:52.989
Children Jehovah wants you to be happy and keep you safe

00:49:52.989 --> 00:49:56.989
But some people want to do bad things to you

00:49:56.989 --> 00:49:59.989
So Jehovah give you a conscience

00:49:59.989 --> 00:50:04.989
It's like an alarm system that helps you to know right from wrong

00:50:04.989 --> 00:50:06.989
It will protect you from danger

00:50:06.989 --> 00:50:11.989
So mum and I will help you test your alarm system ready?

00:50:11.989 --> 00:50:17.989
What if someone tells you something that makes you feel uncomfortable or scares you what do you do?

00:50:17.989 --> 00:50:19.989
I'm not sure but that's weird

00:50:19.989 --> 00:50:20.989
Stop

00:50:20.989 --> 00:50:25.989
Very good tell them to stop it and you tell mum and daddy

00:50:25.989 --> 00:50:31.989
No matter what someone tells you never keep a secret from us

00:50:31.989 --> 00:50:37.989
What if they ask you to do something that makes you feel uncomfortable?

00:50:37.989 --> 00:50:39.989
I would say no

00:50:39.989 --> 00:50:43.989
You're right you should say no and walk away

00:50:43.989 --> 00:50:46.989
What if they try to touch you where they shouldn't?

00:50:46.989 --> 00:50:49.989
I wouldn't let them I'd get out of there

00:50:49.989 --> 00:50:53.989
Good Caleb even if it's an adult you know and trust

00:50:53.989 --> 00:50:56.989
You should say no and run away

00:50:56.989 --> 00:50:59.989
And you should yell stop doing that I'm going to tell on you

00:50:59.989 --> 00:51:02.989
Stop doing that I'm going to tell on you

00:51:02.989 --> 00:51:08.989
The world can be a scary place but you are never alone

00:51:08.989 --> 00:51:11.989
Remember you have your conscience

00:51:11.989 --> 00:51:16.989
Your mum and dad will love you and you have Jehovah

00:51:16.989 --> 00:51:30.929
We're happy to see how Jehovah's organization continues to teach our young ones

00:51:30.929 --> 00:51:37.929
How to make wise choices when the figure of monsters of this world try to lure them into their traps

00:51:37.929 --> 00:51:44.929
And you parents should be commended for your tireless efforts to protect your children

00:51:44.929 --> 00:51:48.929
But when children grow up they face other challenges

00:51:48.929 --> 00:51:54.929
One is whether to pursue a glamorous career or to serve Jehovah more fully

00:51:54.929 --> 00:52:01.929
It can be especially tempting if it's something you are really good at or enjoy

00:52:01.929 --> 00:52:06.929
Just like Caleb and Sophia benefited from sound guidance from their parents

00:52:06.929 --> 00:52:13.929
So did this young brother who saw a big opportunity come his way

00:52:13.929 --> 00:52:29.179
I love music

00:52:29.179 --> 00:52:33.179
When I sing I feel I can do or be anything

00:52:33.179 --> 00:52:36.179
It sets me free

00:52:36.179 --> 00:52:44.539
My classmates tell me to pursue what I want

00:52:44.539 --> 00:52:48.539
And my teachers think that I can have a career doing what I love

00:52:48.539 --> 00:53:02.719
Wouldn't it be awesome to be a famous musician who is known by everyone?

00:53:02.719 --> 00:53:21.269
I know I would never leave Jehovah

00:53:21.269 --> 00:53:27.269
But would it be so wrong to get my career sorted first and then serve Jehovah whole soul?

00:53:27.269 --> 00:53:32.619
Now I have an offer that can do that

00:53:32.619 --> 00:53:36.619
You see our family has never had a lot of money

00:53:36.619 --> 00:53:56.880
And this could change everything we could be rich

00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:08.139
When I told dad my plans how we could have more money he was really grateful I wanted to help

00:54:08.139 --> 00:54:11.139
He liked the idea of using my talent

00:54:11.139 --> 00:54:17.699
But he also mentioned someone who I had never thought about

00:54:17.699 --> 00:54:22.699
Someone who had many opportunities in life and needed to make a choice

00:54:22.699 --> 00:54:27.699
Moses

00:54:27.699 --> 00:54:33.699
Dad left me to think about Hebrews chapter 11 verses 24 to 26

00:54:33.699 --> 00:54:39.699
By faith Moses when grown up refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter

00:54:39.699 --> 00:54:42.699
Choosing to be mistreated with the people of God

00:54:42.699 --> 00:54:46.699
Rather than to have the temporary enjoyment of sin

00:54:46.699 --> 00:54:52.699
Because he considered the reproach of the Christ to be riches greater than the treasures of Egypt

00:54:52.699 --> 00:54:59.679
For he looked intently toward the payment of the reward

00:54:59.679 --> 00:55:01.679
Moses had it all

00:55:01.679 --> 00:55:07.119
Yet he knew that while living in that Egyptian palace

00:55:07.119 --> 00:55:10.119
He could never give Jehovah 100%

00:55:10.119 --> 00:55:13.119
There were too many temptations

00:55:13.119 --> 00:55:17.119
Idol worship, spiritism, materialism

00:55:17.119 --> 00:55:22.119
He rejected this lifestyle and chose to serve Jehovah

00:55:22.119 --> 00:55:28.070
Clearly Moses made the right career choice

00:55:29.070 --> 00:55:32.070
What would my career be?

00:55:32.070 --> 00:55:35.070
Even if I am successful

00:55:35.070 --> 00:55:38.070
Is the dream that they are selling me a reality?

00:55:38.070 --> 00:55:44.320
Or will they throw me out as soon as the next big thing comes along?

00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:46.320
What are the risks?

00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:47.320
Immorality?

00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:49.320
Materialism?

00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:54.820
Would I have the strength to resist these?

00:55:54.820 --> 00:55:59.820
What a change, one scripture and thinking things through can make

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:09.000
My teachers and classmates may never understand why I chose not to pursue a career in music

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.000
But that's okay

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:15.000
The career I chose gives me purpose and happiness now

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:24.050
And has an eternal future

00:56:24.050 --> 00:56:28.050
Now, instead of being the only thing I do in life

00:56:28.050 --> 00:56:32.050
Teaching music helps me to support my career

00:56:32.050 --> 00:56:39.679
Pioneering

00:56:39.679 --> 00:56:41.679
My life is free of regret

00:56:41.679 --> 00:56:49.159
What career choice will you make?

00:56:49.159 --> 00:57:05.190
Similar to the choice this young brother had to make

00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:08.190
We all face big decisions from time to time

00:57:08.190 --> 00:57:11.190
For those who found the truth later in life

00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:15.190
It may have been a big decision to choose to serve Jehovah

00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:19.190
That was the case for brother Michael Lemoine from the United States

00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:22.190
When his wife started studying the Bible with the witnesses

00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:24.190
He was not pleased

00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:27.190
His upbringing made her newly found faith

00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:29.190
Difficult to accept

00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:35.679
I was the youngest of a family of three

00:57:35.679 --> 00:57:39.679
We lived in a little bit of town in Louisiana

00:57:39.679 --> 00:57:43.250
It was predominantly Catholic

00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:46.250
In the Catholic Church, the way that we were taught to pray

00:57:46.250 --> 00:57:48.250
Was a set of repetitive prayers

00:57:48.250 --> 00:57:51.250
Really, it was easy to pray like that

00:57:51.250 --> 00:57:54.250
Because you really didn't have to think

00:57:54.250 --> 00:57:57.250
Once you had those prayers memorized

00:57:57.250 --> 00:57:59.250
Which, you know, was at a very early age

00:57:59.250 --> 00:58:01.250
It was just a rote

00:58:01.250 --> 00:58:08.489
Around the time that I was just about out of college going into law school

00:58:08.489 --> 00:58:09.489
There was something missing

00:58:09.489 --> 00:58:11.489
I wanted to be close to God

00:58:11.489 --> 00:58:17.489
But I didn't know how

00:58:17.489 --> 00:58:21.489
I met Sharon in 1986

00:58:21.489 --> 00:58:25.489
And we ended up getting married the following year

00:58:25.489 --> 00:58:27.489
Sharon and I, because she had been divorced

00:58:27.489 --> 00:58:33.489
We were not allowed to have our marriage be conducted in the Catholic Church with a priest

00:58:33.489 --> 00:58:36.489
And that didn't bother me at first

00:58:36.489 --> 00:58:38.489
But over time it did

00:58:38.489 --> 00:58:42.489
I asked them what it would take for us to be able to bless our marriage

00:58:42.489 --> 00:58:48.489
She would have to undergo a period of sessions of religious training

00:58:48.489 --> 00:58:52.489
When he asked me that, I said, yeah, I'll study with him

00:58:52.489 --> 00:58:55.489
We never, ever opened up a Bible

00:58:55.489 --> 00:58:57.489
It was a little disappointing

00:58:57.489 --> 00:59:04.579
On that same time, there was a cellist sister

00:59:04.579 --> 00:59:07.579
I would study with her and it was all binding

00:59:07.579 --> 00:59:11.579
As I continued learning about the Bible

00:59:11.579 --> 00:59:14.579
The reasoning from the Scriptures was so great

00:59:14.579 --> 00:59:21.579
It was something that I knew I wasn't going to be able to brush off

00:59:21.579 --> 00:59:25.579
So she came forward and said, I have something to tell you

00:59:25.579 --> 00:59:29.579
I have been studying with the Jehovah's Witnesses for a period of time

00:59:29.579 --> 00:59:34.579
I am convinced that this is the true religion

00:59:34.579 --> 00:59:41.579
And I do not want to participate anymore in the Catholic faith, the Catholic Church

00:59:41.579 --> 00:59:48.579
What moved me to tell Mike about my Bible study was Genesis 6.6

00:59:48.579 --> 00:59:52.579
It matters what we do, how we can affect Jehovah

00:59:52.579 --> 00:59:56.579
That he could feel hurt in his heart and it crushed me

00:59:56.579 --> 01:00:05.789
It crushed me because he had the love that he has for us

01:00:05.789 --> 01:00:10.789
I consider it to be the dark years because there was so much animosity on my part

01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:15.789
He was trying to do anything he could to get me to stop

01:00:15.789 --> 01:00:23.789
I even talked about divorce thinking that the shock and awe treatment might bring it to recenses

01:00:23.789 --> 01:00:26.789
He would actually pack up a suitcase and leave

01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:32.789
She, in fact, was becoming a better wife and a better mother

01:00:32.789 --> 01:00:40.789
The sister, my teacher, she'd say, this is good that he is being so jealous about his faith

01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:42.789
Because he loves God

01:00:42.789 --> 01:00:46.789
Like Paul, you know, he thought that was the right thing to do

01:00:46.789 --> 01:00:52.159
I was trained as a lawyer

01:00:52.159 --> 01:00:55.159
I get a case, I usually know nothing about it

01:00:55.159 --> 01:01:01.159
I do an investigation, I retain experts to help me understand what I don't understand

01:01:01.159 --> 01:01:08.159
So, naturally, I'm going to go to my church, I'm going to go to my religious leaders, my spiritual leaders

01:01:08.159 --> 01:01:11.159
And get them to help me with this

01:01:11.159 --> 01:01:16.159
I made an appointment with a very, very high ranking priest

01:01:16.159 --> 01:01:19.159
I told him that my wife was studying with the Jehovah's Witnesses

01:01:19.159 --> 01:01:21.159
And I was seeking some help

01:01:21.159 --> 01:01:26.159
And the first thing that he told me, and I'll never forget this, he looked straight at me

01:01:26.159 --> 01:01:30.159
And said it would take nothing short of a miracle

01:01:30.159 --> 01:01:34.159
For me to pull my wife away from the Jehovah's Witnesses

01:01:34.159 --> 01:01:38.159
Because they knew the Bible so well

01:01:38.159 --> 01:01:43.159
In my life at that point where I'm struggling, I'm trying to win over my family

01:01:43.159 --> 01:01:46.159
That was a devastating day

01:01:47.159 --> 01:01:54.159
So I said, Michael, the Bible, the book from God

01:01:54.159 --> 01:01:57.159
You don't know

01:01:57.159 --> 01:01:59.159
Why not study it?

01:01:59.159 --> 01:02:00.159
Why not study that?

01:02:00.159 --> 01:02:04.159
Like you study the law books or the cases

01:02:04.159 --> 01:02:13.159
I decided that I would go with her on Sunday, on Sunday only, and only for the first half hour

01:02:13.159 --> 01:02:24.820
I'd say it was at least a year that I went to meetings with the aim of learning and refuting it

01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:28.820
But for now, you see how that relates to the question

01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:32.820
You read that the earth will stay forever, that there is no trinity

01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:38.820
There is a name for God the Father, and there is no hellfire, there is no purkatory

01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:42.820
These things were refreshing, I was totally convinced

01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:49.820
By October 1996, I wrote my letter to the same priest who thought it was going to be a miracle for me to get my wife out

01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:57.789
And informed him that I was withdrawing from the Catholic faith

01:02:57.789 --> 01:03:05.789
A large part of the transition that I made was because of the friends and the congregation

01:03:05.789 --> 01:03:09.789
I was not a person that you'd want to approach

01:03:09.789 --> 01:03:13.789
But then when I decided to make the change and it was fast

01:03:13.789 --> 01:03:18.789
These people never treated me any differently, their arms were always open

01:03:18.789 --> 01:03:28.170
Jesus tells us that no one can come to the Father unless Jehovah draws that person

01:03:28.170 --> 01:03:32.170
What he saw, I don't know

01:03:32.170 --> 01:03:38.789
I oftentimes pray to him

01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:41.789
And I don't know what to say

01:03:41.789 --> 01:03:45.789
But I'm deeply appreciative of what he's done for me

01:03:45.789 --> 01:03:58.570
You'll be happy to know that Brother Lemoine now serves as an elder in the coordinator of the body of elders of their congregation

01:03:58.570 --> 01:04:02.570
His wife Sharon and their children serve as regular pioneers

01:04:02.570 --> 01:04:12.570
And sister Lemoine proved through her loyalty to Jehovah that it is possible to stand firm despite persecution from family members

01:04:12.570 --> 01:04:19.570
As we discussed earlier in the program, persecution, opposition come in many forms

01:04:19.570 --> 01:04:24.570
As a father I think especially of our young ones who face immense pressure in school

01:04:24.570 --> 01:04:30.570
Be assured that these tests of faith are only temporary

01:04:30.570 --> 01:04:40.570
With this in mind, I would like to introduce to you an encouraging music video entitled Glad I Past the Test

01:04:40.570 --> 01:04:57.010
Seems like there's something every day, some new test that comes my way, something every day

01:04:57.010 --> 01:05:06.250
I never know what it might be but what I know I have a key

01:05:06.250 --> 01:05:13.940
Because I can face it if I'm steady and prepare so I'll be ready

01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:18.940
How to act in what to say when a challenge comes my way

01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:22.380
I just talk for me out there

01:05:22.380 --> 01:06:49.780
And so I turn to God and I see each tiles my way

01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:54.780
The governing body wants you young ones to know that we are sincerely proud of you

01:06:54.780 --> 01:07:00.780
for loyally supporting Jehovah in the face of temptation and at times even ridicule

01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:04.780
Do you remember the theme scripture referred to at the outset?

01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:07.780
It is 2nd Timothy 312

01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:16.780
It says all those desiring to live with godly devotion in association with Christ Jesus will also be persecuted

01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:21.780
While the scripture clearly highlights that we can expect to be persecuted

01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:25.780
It also provides reassurance in what way

01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:32.780
Because it clearly states that this only happens to those who aren't association with Christ Jesus

01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:38.780
What a privilege to be under his leadership as head of the Christian congregation

01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:45.780
We'd like to close our program with greetings from Marygot and Mao congregations on the Caribbean island nation of Dominica

01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:50.780
The country enjoys a ratio of one publisher to 166 people

01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:56.780
The brothers and sisters there are very zealous and ensuring that everyone gets a witness

01:07:56.780 --> 01:08:00.780
Even a river is no obstacle when a territory needs to be covered

01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:08.780
Also many homes are on steep mountain sides and others in the rainforest which make some areas more difficult to access

01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:19.399
The publishers in Dominica wanted to share this special greeting to our worldwide brotherhood

01:08:19.399 --> 01:08:21.399
And we love them too

01:08:21.399 --> 01:08:28.399
These two congregations have a total of 125 publishers of which four are missionaries

01:08:28.399 --> 01:08:33.399
Three elders take the lead in it, Marygot congregation and six in the Mao congregation

01:08:33.399 --> 01:08:39.399
The preaching work on this island territory is supervised by the Barbados branch

01:08:39.399 --> 01:08:43.399
Thank you all of you around the world for joining us this month

01:08:43.399 --> 01:08:47.399
We keep all of you in our prayers day and night

01:08:47.399 --> 01:08:52.399
This is JW Broadcasting from Brooklyn, New York
