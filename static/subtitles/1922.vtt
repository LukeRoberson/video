WEBVTT

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:08.380
Welcome to our program. To begin, we have a few updates about our brothers and sisters in

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:16.699
Eritrea. As you'll recall, in September 2024, the authorities imprisoned 23 brothers and

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:24.379
sisters who were peacefully meeting together. We're very pleased to inform you that on December 7,

00:00:24.379 --> 00:00:32.460
2024, Sister Sovereign Gebru, who was eight months pregnant at the time, was released from prison.

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:42.539
We rejoice over this positive development. However, her husband, brother Fitsum Goytum, remains in

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:50.060
prison for his faith. Sadly, Eritrea and authorities have recently imprisoned five more of our brothers

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:59.979
and sisters. On November 1, 2024, national security officials arrested four witnesses aged 16

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:11.180
to 18, brothers Zessani Binyum and Ebenezer Jonas, and sisters Seed and Tehista and Horeb Tehista.

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:18.379
The young brothers and sisters were interrogated and immediately taken to the Miserwa prison.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:28.859
On November 22, 2024, Sister Alma's Gebru Hewitt received a telephone call stating that officials

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:36.620
had taken her daughter to the police station. When Sister Alma's went to the station, the officials

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:47.659
detained her but released her daughter. As of December 23, 2024, there are now 68 brothers and

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:55.819
sisters in Eritrea who are imprisoned for their faith. Please, continue to pray for these

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:02.060
dear brothers and sisters, as well as all of those who are imprisoned for their faith.

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:12.379
As reported on JW.org, on November 6, 2024, the town of Rammapot Planning Board

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:19.099
gave approval for the Rammapot site plan. This means that major construction activities

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:27.419
may now begin. We're grateful to the town board for this approval, but above all, we thank Chahova.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.379
What work has been accomplished on the Rammapot project and what's on the horizon?

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:38.300
We're sure you enjoy the following report.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.620
We are thrilled that final permission for the Rammapot project has been approved by the town

00:02:50.620 --> 00:03:13.039
planning board. This is what the site looks like now. A tremendous amount of preparation work has

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:18.319
already been done, including much of the design work. The site has been cleared and temporary

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.840
construction support facilities have been installed. But with this approval, we can now start the

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:42.590
construction work itself. Over the next weeks and months, contractors will begin rock blasting

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.550
to level the land where the buildings will be. Because of the size of the area that will be developed

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:54.110
and the landscape, this activity will take approximately 18 months to complete. As a comparison,

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:01.710
the rock blasting on the Warwick project took less than six months. The rock will then be crushed

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.909
and used to level out other parts of the site and for large retaining walls, all of which will

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:16.860
result in cost savings. Over the next 12 to 18 months, volunteers will start installing the

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:22.379
underground utilities. The two entrances to the property will be complete and the first building

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:28.220
foundations will also be laid. This will quickly lead to structures coming out of the ground,

00:04:28.939 --> 00:05:09.470
such as the parking garage and the residence buildings. We are greatly enjoying

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:13.870
Jehovah's rich blessing on this exciting World Headquarters project.

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:23.379
We pray for Jehovah's continued guidance and blessing on the Ramapo project.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:31.060
We're grateful to all of you dear brothers and sisters who support the Kingdom work worldwide.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:40.100
You show the spirit of those mentioned at Psalm 110 verse 3. Your people will offer themselves

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:47.300
willingly on the day of your military force. In splendid holiness from the womb of the dawn,

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:55.860
you have your company of young men just like do drops. While many assignments are in the background,

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:05.060
some assignments are more visible to others, for example. Various brothers and sisters who appear

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:14.579
in photos in our publications, or who are used in our videos. In recent years, our organization

00:06:14.579 --> 00:06:22.579
has produced hundreds of videos, including full-length dramas. At our conventions this year,

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:29.459
no doubt you appreciated viewing the first episode of the Good News according to Jesus.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:39.379
We look forward to all 18 episodes. We deeply appreciate the time and hard work that various

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:47.300
brothers and sisters contribute to make these projects come to life. Many from around the world

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:53.939
have appeared in our videos. In some cases, a brother or sister has been interviewed,

00:06:54.579 --> 00:07:01.139
or has told an experience from their own life. In other cases, they may have portrayed a

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:08.740
Bible character, or even a modern day character. It could be that you know someone in your local

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:16.420
area who's had this privilege. But here's an important question. How should we view those who

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:25.060
appear in our videos? Those who appear in theocratic videos are dedicated humble servants of

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:33.459
Jehovah. They don't seek fame or glory for themselves. Quite the opposite. They want the glory to go

00:07:33.459 --> 00:07:40.819
to Jehovah. Thankfully, the majority of our brotherhood maintains this proper perspective.

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:49.300
Nevertheless, there's a caution for us as viewers. We must avoid transferring our admiration

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:54.740
for the biblical characters to the brothers and sisters who portray them on screen.

00:07:55.779 --> 00:08:01.379
Instead, we imitate the faith of the men and women recorded in God's Word.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:09.379
How could it affect a video participant if we gave him undue attention, treating him like

00:08:09.379 --> 00:08:18.660
a celebrity? He could feel embarrassed or self-conscious. This could happen if we ask these ones if

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:24.660
we could take a photo with them. It would be even worse if we posted it on social media,

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:34.179
perhaps even adding comments. At Jude 16, the Bible condemns those who were flattering others

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:41.700
for their own benefit. The footnote on that verse describes this as admiring personalities.

00:08:43.379 --> 00:08:49.460
Some of our video participants have become overwhelmed by the inordinate attention.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:54.820
Some no longer feel comfortable attending large gatherings of Jehovah's people.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:02.179
It's vital to have the right perspective of those who appear in our videos.

00:09:03.059 --> 00:09:09.940
Can you think of a Bible example of someone who was given inappropriate attention as he carried out his

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:18.899
assignment? Perhaps you think of Paul and Barnabas. Acts chapter 14 reports that they became the

00:09:18.899 --> 00:09:26.580
center of attention after Paul cured a man who had been lame from birth. This was a faith

00:09:26.659 --> 00:09:32.820
strengthening miracle intended to move people to praise and glorify Jehovah and his son.

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:42.100
But what happened? Onlookers missed the point. They became enthralled with Paul and Barnabas instead.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:52.019
Acts 14 11 and 12 says, When the crowds saw what Paul had done, they cried out in the Likionian

00:09:52.019 --> 00:09:58.580
language. The gods have become like humans and have come down to us and they started calling

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:06.100
Barnabas Zeus, but Paul hermys since he was taking the lead in speaking. What was the issue?

00:10:07.139 --> 00:10:13.299
Instead of appreciating Jehovah's miracle, they became enamored by the visible participants.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:20.740
Did Paul and Barnabas appreciate the attention? Let's read verses 14 and 15.

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:27.379
However, when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they ripped their garments and leaped

00:10:27.379 --> 00:10:34.820
out into the crowd and cried out, Men, why are you doing these things? We too are humans,

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:41.460
having the same infirmities as you have, and we are declaring the good news to you for you to turn

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:49.139
from these vain things to the living God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:56.659
the things in them. Paul and Barnabas were quick to set the record straight. They readily admitted,

00:10:56.659 --> 00:11:02.659
they were just humans. They explained that their purpose was to declare the good news about the

00:11:02.659 --> 00:11:13.059
living God. The same was true of Jesus. He wanted people to glorify God. However, on one occasion,

00:11:13.059 --> 00:11:19.779
the crowd became so impressed by Jesus himself that they failed to grasp the meaning of his teaching.

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:27.940
John 6, 14 and 15 reports, when the people saw the sign he performed, they began to say,

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:35.539
this really is the prophet who was to come into the world. Then Jesus knowing that they were about

00:11:35.539 --> 00:11:44.820
to come and seize him to make him king, withdrew again to the mountain all alone. Jesus did not want

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:51.220
the prominence. He literally walked away from them and withdrew to the mountain all alone.

00:11:52.659 --> 00:11:58.340
How do these Bible examples help us to have the right view of those who appear in our videos?

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:05.860
The brothers and sisters who appear in our videos are humbly carrying out an assignment from the

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:13.220
organization. Like Paul, Barnabas and Jesus, they want the attention and glory to go to Jehovah.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:20.259
Of course, some brothers and sisters are assigned to portray servants of Jehovah,

00:12:20.899 --> 00:12:28.179
but others are assigned to portray enemies of Jehovah. Can you imagine how difficult it

00:12:28.179 --> 00:12:35.299
would be for a faithful brother or sister to portray an enemy of Jehovah? We would not want to make

00:12:35.299 --> 00:12:42.100
that assignment even more difficult by developing negative feelings toward the individuals who play such

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:49.539
roles. Clearly, balance is needed and how we treat those who play roles in our videos.

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:57.539
May we continue to preserve the peace and unity of our worldwide brotherhood by giving

00:12:57.539 --> 00:13:02.659
Jehovah the glory and not the brothers and sisters who appear in our videos.

00:13:04.419 --> 00:13:10.980
So what have we discussed in our update? We rejoice that sister Sovereign Gebrew was released

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:19.460
from prison in Eritrea, but we continue to pray for the over 235 brothers and sisters around

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:26.740
the world who are imprisoned for their faith. We're excited about the recent approval from the

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:32.980
Ramapo Town Board, which will allow major construction to begin on the Ramapo project.

00:13:34.179 --> 00:13:41.059
We also considered the importance of maintaining a balanced view of those who appear in our videos.

00:13:41.779 --> 00:13:50.259
Please know that we love you all very much. From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:13:50.259 --> 00:13:59.460
this is J.W. Broadcasting.
