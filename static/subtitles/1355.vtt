00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.410
The Apostle Paul had managed Timothy to preach the word

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.410
to be edit urgently in favorable times and difficult times.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.410
Paul also set the example and was able to say that he did not hold back

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.410
from teaching publicly and from house to house.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.409
Like Paul, you dear brothers and sisters are seeking out interested people

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:38.409
in a variety of ways.

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:41.409
The service committee of the governing body has oversight

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:44.409
of this evangelizing work worldwide.

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:48.409
We rejoice over the many good reports we have received

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:53.409
from special metropolitan public witnessing since it began in 2011.

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:58.409
We commend you for supporting this initiative by your participation

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:02.409
and by your generous donations to the worldwide work.

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:06.409
Thousands who have not been reached before are receiving Bible literature

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.409
and are being directed to JW.org.

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:15.409
More important, brothers and sisters are starting Bible studies.

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.409
We'd like to share a report from the Netherlands.

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.409
In Amsterdam, an annual event provided an opportunity for our brothers

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.409
to give a witness to millions of visitors.

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.409
Take special note of the planning and preparation needed

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.409
to bear thorough witness in more than a dozen languages

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.409
and see how Jehovah blessed their zeal and love for people.

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:49.500
Sail Amsterdam is one of the largest free nautical events in the world.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.030
For five days, two million visitors could admire hundreds

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.030
of the world's most impressive sailing ships.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:05.299
To reach all these people with the good news from the Bible,

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:11.300
about 700 Jehovah's Witnesses were present at over 30 locations around the city.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.300
Their self-sacrificing spirit resulted in over 6,000 pieces of literature

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.300
spread in more than 12 languages and several new Bible studies.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.300
From all over the world, people are coming to Amsterdam.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:35.159
That's why we want to reach them in their own language.

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:39.159
It was exciting to meet with them more than 600 volunteers.

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:43.159
We were prepared for the sailing event and it was amazing to be with so many

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:46.159
to give such a great witness.

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:51.439
The demonstrations focused primarily on promoting JW.org,

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:56.439
not only the online videos, but also on how to help interested ones

00:02:56.439 --> 00:03:05.939
complete the online contact request form.

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:10.939
We ordered 80 cards and 27,000 publications in 13 languages.

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:18.340
I enjoyed seeing how Jehovah drew individuals to the literature stands

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.340
using not just one, but many.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.340
I saw so many cards with Bible Teachbooks.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.340
Really cool. Very cool.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.340
If they hesitated to take a book from the first literature stand,

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.340
then there was always a second or a third.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.900
Each book contained an invitation for the talk,

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.900
how real is God to you?

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.900
Which was held in 10 different languages.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.900
There are so much effort that is being done just to give everyone an opportunity

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:03.419
to learn about Jehovah.

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:07.419
We were cycling in the city when we saw a stand with books.

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:12.419
So we decided to talk to the standing next to it.

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:20.050
We have two hour shifts from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. with three volunteers at every location.

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:30.860
When traveling on public transportation, such as a tram,

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.860
people get all curious and start talking to you.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:46.899
People from all over the world pass our cards.

00:04:46.899 --> 00:04:51.899
Some speak Russian, others Arabic, French, Italian or Spanish.

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:54.899
And they can all find publications in their own language.

00:04:54.899 --> 00:05:00.750
And when they see the different language labels,

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.750
they often take a book to check whether it's really their language.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.750
And that's when the smile appears on their face.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.750
And when they walk on, it's often with that smile and a book in their hands.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.100
One woman passing by, saw her own language.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.100
She started smiling and said,

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.949
German? German?

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:30.949
She promised to read the book at evening and return it the next day.

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:33.949
When we told her that she could keep it,

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:36.949
she was like, can I really keep it?

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:38.949
Really?

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:42.949
Some brothers have been assigned to supply the different cards.

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:46.949
Either by bicycle, on foot or by tram.

00:05:46.949 --> 00:06:04.490
At some locations, we distribute it more than 15 books per hour.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.490
A farcey speaking man approached our card.

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.490
So I greeted him in farcey saying,

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.490
hello, how are you?

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.490
He said, that's what I like about you people.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:22.620
You really try to reach everyone in their own language.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.620
We stick next to a tram stop so the passengers could see our card.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.620
One of the tram drivers opened the door and asked,

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.620
can I have a book as well?

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.620
So we gave her a copy and she drove on.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:38.540
One brother was approached by a man

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.540
and he was able to read Revelation 21, 3 and 4 to him.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.540
The man was so moved that he started crying

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.540
and even agreed to a Bible study.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.540
Jehovah is clearly reaching out to all these people,

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:59.970
telling them, look, look at all the good things I want for you.

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.970
It struck me how many people are still looking for answers.

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.970
There's still so much work to do.

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:12.009
This isn't man's work.

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:17.009
Seeing Jehovah's hand in this warms my heart.

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:19.009
It's amazing.

00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:21.009
It exceeded our expectations.

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:24.009
We hope many have gained a better understanding

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:27.009
of the golden future promised by Jehovah,

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:30.009
the creator of heaven, earth and the sea.
