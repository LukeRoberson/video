00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.620
They are all living to Him, powerful text.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.619
Jehovah is the God of the living.

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:15.619
To Jehovah, death is not goodbye, but see you later.

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.620
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are living in Jehovah's memory

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.620
until his appointed time to resurrect them.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.620
How comforting it is to know that faithful servants of God,

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.620
including our dead loved ones, will return to life

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.619
and are living in Jehovah's limitless memory at this time.

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:38.619
He will bring them back in his due time.

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:40.619
Now, during a funeral talk,

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:44.619
we might hear the words of Ecclesiastes 7 verse 2.

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:46.619
Reminding us that when a loved one dies,

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:49.619
the living should take it to heart.

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:51.619
In other words, we should think about our own life

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:54.619
and what we're doing to make a good name with God

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:57.619
to become his friends.

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:01.619
If you were to give a memorial service for Abraham,

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:03.619
what would you include?

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:07.620
How would you condense his 175 years into 30 minutes

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.620
in a funeral talk or a 10-minute morning worship program?

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.620
When did Abraham live?

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:20.620
According to Bible chronology from 2018 to 1843 BCE.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.620
At Isaiah 41 verse 8, Abraham was spoken of as Jehovah's friend.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.620
Yes, over 1,000 years after his death,

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.620
Abraham was still living in Jehovah's memory.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.620
But we find other similar expressions

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.620
at 2 Chronicles 20 verse 7 written about 460 BCE,

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.620
and James 223 written before 62 CE,

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.620
and Abraham is living to Jehovah even today.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.620
But why?

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.620
What exceptional qualities,

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.620
what outstanding qualities made Jehovah,

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.620
excuse me, made Abraham a friend of Jehovah?

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.620
Well, let's consider just three ways

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.620
and then how we can imitate Abraham.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:15.620
First, Abraham willingly made sacrifices to serve Jehovah.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.620
If you turn to Hebrews chapter 11,

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.620
notice with me please verses 8 through 10.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.620
It says, by faith Abraham, when he was called,

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.620
obeyed by going out to a place he was to receive as an inheritance,

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.620
he went out, although not knowing where he was going.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.620
By faith, he lived as a foreigner in the land of promise

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.620
as in a foreign land,

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.620
living intense with Isaac and Jacob,

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.620
the heirs with him of the very same promise,

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.620
for he was awaiting the city having real foundations,

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.620
whose designer and builder is God.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.620
Well, first Abraham moved from earth,

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.620
a city with modern conveniences to hay ran,

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.620
which had beehive shaped huts.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.620
Well, was Abraham's next move an upgrade in his living accommodations?

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.620
Well, that depends on your perspective.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.620
If you enjoy sleeping under the stars, then yes.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.620
But Abraham was willing to live intense

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.620
as he awaited the future realities of God's kingdom.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.990
Really, Abraham had no place to call home.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.990
And that meant that Sarah, his wife,

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:28.990
had no place to call home.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.990
But neither Abraham nor Sarah were resentful

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.990
for their sacrifices.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.990
Verse 15 says, and yet if they had kept remembering the place

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.990
from which they had departed,

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.990
they would have had opportunity to return.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.990
Abraham and his wife, Sarah,

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.990
cherished their service to Jehovah

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.990
despite some material disadvantages.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.990
Well, what's the lesson?

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.990
How can we take it to heart?

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.990
Well, isn't life and full-time service full of sacrifices?

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.990
But we don't live intense,

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.990
but we could be asked to serve in a different department,

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.990
a different complex, a different branch.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.990
We might be asked to work extra hours from time to time.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.990
Jehovah certainly loves those who willingly, joyfully,

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.990
sacrifice for him.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:22.990
What's a second outstanding quality of Abraham?

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.990
We find the answer in Genesis chapter 13 verses 8 and 9.

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.990
Genesis 13, 8 and 9.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.990
What happened when the flocks and goods of Abraham and Lot

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.990
became too many to reside in one place?

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.990
Notice, Genesis 13, 8, so Abraham said to Lot,

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.990
please, there should be no quarreling between me and you

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.990
and my herdsmen and your herdsmen.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.990
For we are brothers.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.990
Is not the whole land available to you?

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.990
Please separate from me.

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.990
If you go to the left, then I will go to the right.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.990
But if you go to the right, then I will go to the left.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.990
What's the point?

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.990
Abraham was a peacemaker.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.990
He was selfless, not selfish.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.990
He didn't say, well, I've got this seniority here.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.990
Instead, he gave the first choice to his nephew Lot.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.990
Abraham was selfless.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.990
Well, sadly, Lot picked the well-watered region of the Jordan

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.990
and lived among the cities of the district.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.990
He later pitched his tent near Sodom.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.990
Later, he was living in Sodom.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.990
Well, how did Abraham react when Lot was later taken captive?

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.990
Chapter 14 informs us.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.990
Verse 14 says,

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.990
Sorry, Lot, you're on your own here.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.990
You're the one who decided to live in Sodom.

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.990
No notice how the verse continues.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.990
With that, he mobilized his trained men,

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.990
318 servants born in his household

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.990
and he went and pursued up to Dan.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.990
During the night, he divided his forces

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.990
and he and his servants attacked and defeated them.

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.990
And he pursued them up to Holba,

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.990
which is north of Damascus.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.990
He recovered all the goods

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.990
and he also recovered Lot, his relative,

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.990
his goods, the women and the other people.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.990
Abraham went out of his way to rescue Lot.

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.990
From the south of what would later become Israel,

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.990
he pursued the attackers all the way to Dan,

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.990
to Damascus and even north, farther north, to Holba.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.990
What are the lessons?

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.990
How can we take it to heart?

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:33.990
Are we peacemakers?

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.990
Are we selfless?

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.990
Do we avoid the entitlement mentality

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:43.990
that is thinking that we deserve certain favors or privileges?

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.990
Are we willing to offer help to other servants of Jehovah,

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.990
even if they've made bad decisions at times?

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:54.990
Jehovah certainly cherishes those

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.990
who display qualities similar to Abraham.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:00.990
What's a third way?

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.990
We can learn a lot from Abraham's display of hospitality

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:10.990
at Genesis chapter 18 verses 1 through 8.

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:15.990
And this will demonstrate that Abraham gave Jehovah his best.

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:17.990
Verses 2 and 3, we notice

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.990
when these visitors came to him.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:21.990
What did he do?

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:23.990
He looked up and saw three men standing

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.990
some distance from him

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:27.990
when he saw them.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.990
He ran from the entrance of the tent to meet them

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:32.990
and he bowed down to the ground.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:34.990
Then he said,

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.990
Jehovah, if I have found favor in your eyes, please,

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.990
do not pass by your servant.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:46.269
When Abraham saw these men who were materialized angels,

00:07:46.269 --> 00:07:48.269
representatives of Jehovah,

00:07:48.269 --> 00:07:51.269
he ran to meet them.

00:07:51.269 --> 00:07:54.269
Now, that in itself might not seem so remarkable

00:07:55.269 --> 00:07:57.269
until we think about the fact that

00:07:57.269 --> 00:07:59.269
Abraham was 99 years old

00:07:59.269 --> 00:08:02.269
and this was the hottest part of the day.

00:08:02.269 --> 00:08:04.269
Quite impressive.

00:08:04.269 --> 00:08:07.269
Well, after his visitors agreed to remain for a little water

00:08:07.269 --> 00:08:09.269
and a piece of bread,

00:08:09.269 --> 00:08:10.269
as the account says,

00:08:10.269 --> 00:08:12.269
what did Abraham do?

00:08:12.269 --> 00:08:15.269
Verses 6 through 8 tell us.

00:08:15.269 --> 00:08:18.269
So Abraham hurried to the tent to Sarah

00:08:18.269 --> 00:08:19.269
and said,

00:08:19.269 --> 00:08:22.269
quick, get three measures of fine flour.

00:08:22.269 --> 00:08:24.269
Need the dough and make loaves of bread.

00:08:24.269 --> 00:08:26.269
Next, Abraham ran to the herd

00:08:26.269 --> 00:08:28.269
and chose a tender and good young bull.

00:08:28.269 --> 00:08:31.269
He gave it to the attendant who hurried to prepare it.

00:08:31.269 --> 00:08:33.269
He then took butter and milk

00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:35.269
and the young bull that he had prepared

00:08:35.269 --> 00:08:37.269
and set the food before them.

00:08:37.269 --> 00:08:40.269
Then he stood by them under the tree

00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:43.679
as they were eating.

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:46.679
Three measures of fine flour were used to make the bread.

00:08:46.679 --> 00:08:48.679
According to the footnote,

00:08:48.679 --> 00:08:50.679
each see a measure of flour

00:08:50.679 --> 00:08:53.679
amounted to more than six quarts.

00:08:53.679 --> 00:08:56.679
To those of you who are bakers in our audience,

00:08:56.679 --> 00:09:00.679
that's 24 cups of flour for each loaf of bread.

00:09:00.679 --> 00:09:02.679
Imagine that loaf of bread.

00:09:02.679 --> 00:09:05.679
Well, what else did Abraham offer to his guests?

00:09:05.679 --> 00:09:08.679
These representatives of a Jehovah.

00:09:08.679 --> 00:09:12.679
A tender and good young bull, the account says.

00:09:12.679 --> 00:09:15.679
Maybe we on occasion have enjoyed a tender steak

00:09:15.679 --> 00:09:19.679
with freshly baked bread smeared with butter.

00:09:19.679 --> 00:09:21.679
What's the point?

00:09:21.679 --> 00:09:25.679
Abraham gave Jehovah his best.

00:09:25.679 --> 00:09:27.679
Is this the only time the scriptures record Abraham

00:09:27.679 --> 00:09:30.679
giving his best to Jehovah?

00:09:30.679 --> 00:09:33.679
Well, chapter 22 relates how Abraham was willing

00:09:33.679 --> 00:09:37.679
to give his son Isaac to Jehovah.

00:09:37.679 --> 00:09:40.679
Sacrifice his precious son.

00:09:40.679 --> 00:09:42.679
The lesson for us.

00:09:42.679 --> 00:09:44.679
Do we give Jehovah our best?

00:09:44.679 --> 00:09:46.679
In our daily service at Bethel,

00:09:46.679 --> 00:09:48.679
what are we offering to our God?

00:09:49.679 --> 00:09:51.679
A tender and good young bull,

00:09:51.679 --> 00:09:54.679
freshly baked bread and butter,

00:09:54.679 --> 00:09:57.679
or something less appealing?

00:09:57.679 --> 00:10:00.679
So what have we learned?

00:10:00.679 --> 00:10:04.679
Abraham's life demonstrated his faith in Jehovah.

00:10:04.679 --> 00:10:08.679
He willingly made sacrifices in Jehovah's service.

00:10:08.679 --> 00:10:12.679
He was a peacemaker, selfless in his dealings with others,

00:10:12.679 --> 00:10:15.679
and he gave his very best to Jehovah.

00:10:15.679 --> 00:10:18.679
If we do the same, then just like Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,

00:10:18.679 --> 00:10:23.679
we will forever remain friends of Jehovah, the God of the living.
