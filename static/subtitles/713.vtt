00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:08.179
You students are really like beautiful trees planted along the River Gilead.

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:12.779
Jeremiah chapter 17 and verse 8 describes such beautiful trees.

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:14.259
Let's read that together.

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:21.379
Jeremiah chapter 17 and verse 8, it says he will become like a tree planted by the waters

00:00:21.379 --> 00:00:24.699
that sends out its roots to the stream.

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:30.059
He will not notice when he comes, but his leaves will always flourish.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:38.140
And in the year of drought, he will not be anxious, nor will he quit producing fruit.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.380
Well, you've enjoyed the spiritual waters taught here at Gilead.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.500
And as you graduate today and you go off to your assignments,

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:54.619
your leaves are flourishing and you're producing fruit, figuratively speaking.

00:00:54.659 --> 00:01:00.780
Now, did you notice, though, in verse 8, what the righteous trees had to deal with?

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.939
It says, when the heat comes and in the year of drought.

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:12.500
Now, it doesn't say not if the heat comes, but when the heat comes.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.659
So what is that heat and the year of drought?

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.420
Well, there are many forms of heat we deal with in addition to what you

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.260
considered about this verse in class.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:30.859
I'd like to focus on one particular form of heat, and that is persecution.

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:38.099
Restrictions on our work and bands are designed to create fear.

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:45.299
Negative articles in the media about Jehovah's Witnesses are designed to create doubt.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.099
Religious leaders and opposers, they attack our neutrality,

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:54.819
our clear support for the Bible's view of sex and marriage,

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:59.140
or discipline by dispeloshipping and other matters.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.620
And add to that that some of our brothers are being rounded up and thrown into prison,

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:09.659
we can say that Satan has truly turned up the heat.

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:11.819
What will happen to the trees?

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.419
Will fear and doubt cause them to shrivel up and die during the drought?

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:17.419
No.

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:23.139
If you notice there in verse 8, Jehovah says the righteous will not notice the heat

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:27.819
and not be anxious in the drought.

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.020
Well, why is Jehovah confident that the righteous trees won't notice the heat

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.139
and won't whither up in the drought?

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:38.740
Look at verse 7 of Jeremiah 17.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.979
Is as blessed as the man who puts his trust in Jehovah,

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:48.500
whose confidence is in Jehovah?

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.340
So what will you do in the year of drought?

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.620
Trust in Jehovah?

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.099
You see, Satan wants to destroy our trust in Jehovah,

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.460
right from the very first with Eve.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.539
Is it really so?

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:12.939
His whole system is built on fear, uncertainty, and doubt.

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:16.860
Persecution we could liken it to when you're in an airplane

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.300
and it has some turbulence and it begins to shake.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.460
One flight I was on, there was one woman that cried in terror.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:31.060
She screamed out loud every time the plane shook even just a little.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.219
I mean, she was genuinely terrified.

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:36.539
I felt sorry for her.

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:41.379
But the experienced flyers, they were eating, reading, watching movies.

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:44.860
They didn't even notice the turbulence.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:45.620
Why?

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.099
Well, from experience, they knew that the plane could easily

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:51.500
handle such small amount of turbulence

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.659
and they were not worried.

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:56.500
It was designed for that.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.500
Well, we are like experienced flyers.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.460
We don't let the turbulence or persecution

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.379
of this system cause us fear or doubt.

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:10.020
With Jehovah and Jesus as our pilots,

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.020
we don't need to be anxious, do we?

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.379
Let's consider two ways that we can show trust in Jehovah's,

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:18.540
Jeremiah 17, seven says.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.579
First, we're going to talk about trusting the faithful

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.259
and discreet slave and trusting Bible principles.

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:29.019
Let's talk first about trusting the faithful and discreet slave.

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:31.459
The faithful and discreet slave has been selected

00:04:31.459 --> 00:04:37.860
and appointed by Jehovah and experience is shown we can trust them.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.139
You see, trust is built by repeated good experiences.

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.420
Think of all the good experiences we've

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.300
had with the faithful and discreet slave

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.019
and following their direction.

00:04:51.019 --> 00:04:53.100
Now, some might reason, well, you know,

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.100
the direction from the faithful and discreet slave

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.939
is good for the United States.

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:59.180
But they don't understand here.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.100
They don't understand my assignment where I've been assigned.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.170
We need to do things differently.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:12.089
Trust in the faithful and discreet slave is not geographical.

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:14.930
Jehovah's direction through the faithful and discreet slave

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:21.290
applies to all of God's people all over the earth.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.610
See, fear is really a loss of memory

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.569
of what Jehovah has done for us.

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:32.129
Satan wants us to forget all the good experiences

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:34.370
we've had with the faithful and discreet slave

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.009
and let one moment of fear get to us

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:40.329
and cause us to wither in the heat.

00:05:40.329 --> 00:05:42.970
Second Thessalonians chapter 2 and verse 2 says,

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.250
not to be quickly shaken from your reason

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.490
nor to be alarmed, especially at rumors.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.410
Now, your trust in the faithful and discreet slave

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.290
is going to be put to the test.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.410
Satan will make sure of that.

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.290
It could be your own thoughts.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.009
I know better.

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:06.129
Or maybe some twisted lies you read or hear.

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:09.410
Either way, it's a trap.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.290
Stay away from such ideas.

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:17.610
Trust what you know about the faithful and discreet slave.

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:23.930
Isaiah 30, 15 says, your strength will be in keeping calm

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.449
and showing trust.

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:28.649
Remember, the faithful and discreet slave

00:06:28.649 --> 00:06:31.889
has been selected and appointed by Jehovah.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:37.610
And our experience has shown that we can trust them.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.250
Now, let's consider trusting Bible principles

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:42.810
or second point.

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.769
See, Bible principles are timeless pearls of wisdom

00:06:46.769 --> 00:06:48.490
from Jehovah.

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.329
But many people today attack our decision

00:06:51.329 --> 00:06:53.970
to live by Bible principles in this modern world.

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.689
They say that's outdated.

00:06:56.689 --> 00:06:59.730
However, we trust Bible principles

00:06:59.769 --> 00:07:04.610
because experience tells us they always work.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.810
One sister asked, what helps her to be calm

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.050
and very difficult to try in situations

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:13.740
and she said, give me a scripture.

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:18.420
Jesus' mother Mary had that same give me a scripture attitude.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:22.060
Luke 251 says that Mary made it her habit

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.139
to keep these sayings in her heart.

00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:28.980
See, Mary was really like a tree soaking in all of these waters

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.620
of Jesus teaching and his amazing miracles.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:37.180
While the heat for Mary came when the Pharisees and Sadducees

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:40.019
maybe even her own family, their neighbors

00:07:40.019 --> 00:07:42.939
began to attack Jesus, call him names,

00:07:42.939 --> 00:07:48.060
slander his reputation and attack his motives.

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:52.540
What helped Mary to deal with the heat,

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:58.720
those waters that she had treasured up in her heart?

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.680
What Bible principles and experiences

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.279
are you keeping in your heart to help you

00:08:05.279 --> 00:08:07.519
when you come under attack?

00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:11.800
Be like Mary and keep in your heart

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:16.160
your good experiences in applying Bible principles.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:20.680
Stick to what you know works, Bible principles.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.399
They always work and they never get out of date.

00:08:24.399 --> 00:08:26.720
Not you or anyone else can come up

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.399
with better principles to live by.

00:08:29.399 --> 00:08:32.919
Remember, we trust Bible principles

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:35.519
because they come from Jehovah

00:08:35.519 --> 00:08:39.440
and our own experience tells us they always work.

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:43.080
Now, trusting the faithful and discreet slave

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:48.080
and trusting the Bible are just two of many ways

00:08:48.799 --> 00:08:50.960
that we can show that we trust Jehovah.

00:08:52.519 --> 00:08:55.679
So what will you do in the year of drought?

00:08:55.679 --> 00:08:57.919
Trust in Jehovah.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.480
I mean, think of the birds.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.759
When they're flying high up there,

00:09:01.759 --> 00:09:03.559
are they worried, oh, I think I'm gonna fall?

00:09:03.559 --> 00:09:04.600
I'm really worried.

00:09:05.639 --> 00:09:08.039
Well, no, birds don't worry about that, do they?

00:09:08.039 --> 00:09:08.879
Why?

00:09:08.879 --> 00:09:12.039
Well, they rely on the wings and instincts

00:09:12.039 --> 00:09:13.919
Jehovah gave them, they can fly.

00:09:14.799 --> 00:09:17.600
Likewise, we don't need to be anxious

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.440
when faced with lies, bans, or attacks

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.919
on our Bible principles.

00:09:23.919 --> 00:09:27.399
Jehovah has given us what we need to fly, so to speak,

00:09:27.399 --> 00:09:29.279
the faithful and discreet slave,

00:09:29.279 --> 00:09:33.279
Bible principles, prayer, holy spirit, and more.

00:09:34.759 --> 00:09:36.679
As we had further into the system

00:09:36.679 --> 00:09:40.360
as the heat from this system intensifies, remember,

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.879
fear and doubt are reactions,

00:09:44.879 --> 00:09:49.120
but our decision is trust and courage.
