00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:06.330
Hi, I'm Armando. Welcome to Iron Sharpen's Iron.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:17.739
We've all been there.

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:22.739
We're out in the ministry trying to start conversations with people.

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:27.739
But for many of us, it's not that easy.

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:32.740
Just the idea of talking to a stranger can be intimidating.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.740
Personally, I'm not someone who finds it easy

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.740
to just walk up to a stranger and start a conversation.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.310
But with some effort and time,

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:49.310
I've learned a few methods that have helped me to overcome my fears.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.310
Today, we're going to concentrate on just one of them,

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.310
using questions to start and maintain a conversation.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.310
And perhaps, by the time we're done, you'll realize like I have

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.310
that it's not as difficult as it seems.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:12.200
Either. Well, we're asking our neighbors a question

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.200
and we'd like to know your opinion.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.200
Have you ever asked yourself what we need to do to have a happy family?

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.200
No, I'm not married.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.200
Oh, okay. Well, we have this brochure that talks about...

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.200
Okay, three things.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.200
First, the brother was nervous.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.200
When we're nervous, we make the person we're speaking with nervous too.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.200
Of course, it's difficult not to be nervous,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.200
but if we concentrate too much on how we feel,

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.200
we can forget that what we want to do is simply start a conversation.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.510
There's no pressure. Just keep it casual.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.510
Second, yes, the brother did ask a question,

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.510
but the question was irrelevant to the householder.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.509
It's usually better to ask something that will encourage the person

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.509
to participate in the conversation,

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:17.509
but will also help us to discern what interests them.

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:21.509
Third, one of the biggest fears we have is

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:24.509
what if my question doesn't connect with them?

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:26.509
This can throw us off.

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:29.509
We feel like we have nowhere to go.

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:32.509
It would have been better to have a flexible approach

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:37.509
that would allow us to react according to what the person says.

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:40.509
Let's try it again, but this time,

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:43.509
let's approach the situation a little differently.

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:46.509
In the first few pages of our Bible,

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:50.509
there are 20 questions that we can use in the ministry.

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:54.509
Why not start familiarizing ourselves with them?

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:56.509
We can choose one or two subjects that we like

00:02:56.509 --> 00:03:00.509
so that we will be ready when an opportunity rises.

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:04.509
Let's see how our brother does this in the next demonstration.

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:07.509
Hi there. We're asking our neighbors a question,

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:10.509
and we'd love to know your opinion.

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:14.509
What would you say is something that causes you a lot of stress?

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:19.509
Personally, I worry a lot about money and paying all my bills.

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:22.509
Yeah, I think that's the case for many of us.

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:25.509
Did you know that the Bible explains something

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:28.509
that can help us specifically with that anxiety?

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:29.509
Really?

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:31.509
In the front of my Bible,

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:34.509
there are 20 questions that many of us ask

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:36.509
and that the Bible answers.

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:38.509
Notice question 16.

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:42.509
How can you cope with anxiety?

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:46.509
Notice what this scripture says in Proverbs 21-5.

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:49.509
The plans of the diligent.

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:51.509
Much better, right?

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:54.509
Did you notice that when the person answered,

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:57.509
the brother simply opened his Bible to the questions

00:03:57.509 --> 00:04:02.509
and found a scripture that allowed him to continue the conversation?

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:05.509
And he didn't try to hide what he was doing.

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:08.509
He showed the person the tool he was using.

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:11.509
He felt confident that however the person responded,

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:14.509
he would be able to find a useful scripture

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:16.509
that would keep the conversation moving.

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:19.509
So that went pretty well.

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:22.509
But maybe you're thinking

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:26.509
it almost never happens like that for me.

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:30.509
Perhaps in our case,

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:33.949
it's more like this.

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:34.949
Hi there.

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:36.949
We're asking our neighbors a question

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:39.949
and we'd love to know your opinion.

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:43.949
What would you say is something that causes you a lot of stress?

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.949
People coming to my door and asking me questions.

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:48.949
I understand.

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:50.949
I'm not a fan of that myself.

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:55.949
But have you ever wondered why we do this?

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:56.949
Now at this point,

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:59.949
the householder may shut down the conversation completely.

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:00.949
And that's fine.

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:03.949
We're not trying to pressure anyone into talking.

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:07.949
But that second question that the publisher asks.

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:10.949
And the fact that he was calm, that he was relaxed,

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:13.949
and that he was not taking himself too seriously,

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:18.949
all of that can open the door for the conversation to continue.

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:20.949
To sum up,

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:21.949
remember,

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:23.949
first,

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:26.949
be calm and relaxed.

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:29.949
We're just trying to start a conversation.

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:30.949
Smile.

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:32.949
Be friendly.

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:34.949
Second,

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:38.949
ask a question that brings a person into the conversation

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:42.949
and allows us to discover what interests them.

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:44.949
And third,

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:48.949
don't be nervous about where the conversation could lead.

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:51.949
With our 20 questions for the ministry,

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:54.949
we can be sure that we'll find an appropriate text

00:05:54.949 --> 00:06:01.230
that will keep the conversation directed towards spiritual matters.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.230
This is one of the methods that has helped me,

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.230
and I hope that it can help you too.

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:11.230
As you see for yourself how ironed, sharpens iron,
