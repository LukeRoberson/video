00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:07.519
You think not God's thoughts, but those of men.

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:10.000
Has that ever happened to us?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.160
When is it particularly dangerous to do so?

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:21.679
Well, the text for today is based on the events of Matthew 16, verses 21 through 23, and

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:24.120
let's read that together.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:30.539
Matthew 16, 21, from that time forward, Jesus began explaining to His disciples that He

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.320
must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders in chief priests and scribes,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.159
and be killed, and on the third day be raised up.

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:45.659
At this Peter took him aside and began to review Kim, saying, be kind to yourself, Lord,

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:48.299
you will not have this happen to you at all.

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:52.859
But turning his back, he said to Peter, get behind me, Satan.

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:58.100
You are a stumbling block to me, because you think not God's thoughts, but those of

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.600
men.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.719
Now Jesus here had just expressed real events that were going to take place.

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.799
This is from that time forward.

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.280
He began to explain them from this account and parallel accounts.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.280
We see he began to talk about what was going to happen, where they were going to go,

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.079
what would happen to him, perhaps even what was going to happen to the apostles.

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.680
But what do Peter say?

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.920
He had a fact that, no, no, Jesus, no, no, you're wrong.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.079
You're not thinking right.

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:26.799
You're overreacting.

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.959
Nothing's going to happen.

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:34.599
Now while Peter took the brunt of the council, the parallel account in Mark chapter 8 indicates

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:38.120
that perhaps the other apostles thought the same way.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.760
See they found it what Jesus was saying is hard to believe.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.400
Now what was the problem?

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.959
These were not wicked men.

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:51.840
These were spiritual men, but the problem was that at that moment they were using human

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.920
reasoning, thoughts of men rather than realizing that Jesus was expressing God's thoughts.

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.439
Now Jesus immediately corrected their thinking.

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:08.199
See at this crucial time, he needed Peter and the apostles, and not in front of him as a stumbling block,

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.879
but behind him as willing supporters.

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:16.479
At this time, Jesus needed support, not distractors.

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:18.960
And the apostles obviously got the message.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.240
And there's no indication that Jesus ever had to counsel them like that again.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.199
In fact, in Luke chapter 22, verse 28, Jesus even commended them and said,

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:32.360
you are the ones who have stuck with me in my trials.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.080
See they learned a very valuable lesson.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.919
And what was that?

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:42.879
That lesson was trust Jehovah and trust the channel that Jehovah is using.

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.680
And if they do that, they would be thinking God's thoughts.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.800
And they also learned that it was imperative that they did so, especially as pressures mount

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.159
as they got closer to the end of Jesus' ministry.

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:57.680
Well, how about us?

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.080
How do we do?

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.840
Do we think thoughts of men or do we think God's thoughts?

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.439
Well, no doubt all of us struggle at times.

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:07.520
I know I do.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.360
I'm very sure that at times Jesus would like to say to me, or perhaps he does,

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.840
or Rob, you're thinking not thoughts of God, but rather thoughts of men,

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.800
due to how I react to things at times.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.639
And no doubt we all do that.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.680
And we have to be careful, though,

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.479
because events and pressures at times can cause us to only see things

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:32.800
through the perspective of humans, human thinking.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.199
Now, when would that be particularly dangerous?

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:40.479
Well, when you think about it, it's very easy to trust Jehovah

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:44.840
and his representatives when things are going well.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.000
It's also quite easy to trust Jehovah and the channel he's using

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.599
when things are obvious.

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:57.719
But it's not always so easy to do when things become confusing,

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:01.000
or when things start to get more dire.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.439
We may think of the nation of Israel as they were getting ready to leave Egypt.

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:08.400
If you look at Exodus chapter 11,

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.599
notice chapter 11, verse 3,

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.360
it says, and Jehovah gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.439
Moreover, Moses himself had become highly esteemed in the land of Egypt

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:22.920
among Pharaoh's servants and among the people.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.920
The interesting thing at this time, at the usualized Egyptians,

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.079
they had already seen the nine plagues.

00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:31.879
It was obvious that something was going on.

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:35.279
And many were willing to follow Moses, do exactly what he said.

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:38.639
If you look in chapter 12, we see Moses giving directions,

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:43.120
stain your homes, what to eat, how to cook it, how to eat it.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.879
And look at chapter 12, and verse 50,

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:50.360
it says, the Israelites did just as Moses commanded.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.399
See, at this point, they were sure this 10th plague was going to happen.

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:58.399
There's no record of any dissent, any argument with Moses,

00:04:58.399 --> 00:05:02.439
complete obedience, willing submission.

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:05.240
But now, what about us things got a little more confusing?

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.240
Got more dire.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.439
What about when they appeared shortly thereafter to be trapped by the Red Sea?

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:14.319
We'll look over to chapter 14, verse 11 and 12.

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:18.879
They said to Moses, is it because there are no burial places in Egypt?

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:21.199
You have brought us here to die in the wilderness.

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:24.160
What have you done to us by leading us out of Egypt?

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.160
Is this not the very thing we told you in Egypt when we said,

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.800
let us alone so that we may serve the Egyptians?

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.560
For it is better for us to serve the Egyptians

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.600
than to die in the wilderness.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.720
My, what a difference.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.800
What have you done to us?

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.000
You don't know what you're doing.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.360
We're all going to die.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.879
See, they began looking at things from man's perspective, not gods.

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:48.519
What's a lesson?

00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:51.199
Well, the lesson is that as pressures mount,

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:55.800
we need to continue to make sure that we are thinking God's thoughts.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.360
We need to continue to trust the channel that Jehovah is using.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.279
Now, these events over the past few months have reminded us

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:07.920
or shown us demonstrated how quickly the world can change.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.920
From one minute, it's riding high.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.360
The next minute, it's in panic.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.560
It's in turmoil.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.920
We've also seen how quickly our lives can change.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.959
From one minute, with our congregations,

00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:20.839
we're serving Jehovah, we're working, going on vacations,

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:25.319
traveling to assignments, and suddenly, everything is stopped.

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:27.240
How did we do?

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.920
Well, so encouraging to see how well the organization has

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.600
responded completely, supporting the adjustments made

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.079
rallying behind all the changes to make them work,

00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:40.160
continue to have that resolve.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.959
Trust Jehovah.

00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:46.240
Trust the channel that Jehovah is using.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.920
But again, it's relatively easy to do that

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:55.439
when the situation is obvious, such as it is now.

00:06:55.439 --> 00:06:58.439
Well, what happens if things get more confusing?

00:06:58.439 --> 00:06:59.920
Get more dire.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.199
We know going to Bible prophecy at some point in the future

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:05.560
that is going to happen.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.560
See, it's at that time we need to be extra careful

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.279
that we do not rely on man's thinking, human reasoning.

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:13.879
Why?

00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:17.000
Because we cannot trust human reasoning,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.519
but we can rely on Jehovah's direction.

00:07:20.519 --> 00:07:22.439
And to illustrate that from me, I always

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:25.600
think of two of the attacks and the contrast

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.160
of two of the attacks on Jerusalem.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.040
And in both situations, it was dire.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.439
It was confusing.

00:07:32.439 --> 00:07:33.319
They were trapped.

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:35.879
It looked like they were going to die.

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:38.240
Remember the one when the Assyrians came

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.680
against Jerusalem and Hezekiah's time,

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.720
the direction through Isaiah, the prophet,

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.480
was very, very clear.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.319
It was, do not go to Egypt for support

00:07:48.319 --> 00:07:51.480
and do not surrender to the Assyrians.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.079
Now, you remember from Ardrama and from the Bible account,

00:07:54.079 --> 00:07:55.600
that went against human reasoning.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.560
They wanted to appeal to Egypt.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.480
Some did Egypt for support.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.600
Others saw, well, maybe if we surrender,

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.160
the Assyrians will be kind to us,

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.000
but Jehovah's direction was clear.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:05.920
What happened?

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.480
They followed the direction and they lived.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:13.000
Now, later on, when the Babylonians came against Jerusalem,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.920
again, Jehovah's direction through Jeremiah,

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.480
the prophet was very clear.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.680
Do not go to Egypt for support,

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:23.399
but do surrender to the Babylonians.

00:08:23.399 --> 00:08:25.800
And again, that went completely against human reasoning.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.920
They were so mad, they wanted to kill Jeremiah.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.079
They wanted to go to Egypt for support.

00:08:30.079 --> 00:08:31.399
They eventually did.

00:08:31.399 --> 00:08:35.080
They definitely did not want to surrender to the Babylonians,

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.480
maybe even thinking back to Hezekiah's time

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.120
when they were commanded not to do that.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.639
What happened?

00:08:41.639 --> 00:08:46.440
They did not follow the direction with tragic results.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.159
So what's the lesson?

00:08:48.159 --> 00:08:50.480
The lesson is that in both cases,

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:55.039
survival depended on trusting the channel Jehovah was using

00:08:55.039 --> 00:08:58.759
and following that direction even when it went against

00:08:58.759 --> 00:09:01.840
human reasoning, popular opinion.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.000
Well, what about today?

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.440
Well, we do not know where these events,

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.360
current events, are heading.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.080
This may just be another marker in time

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.759
and an event in history or not.

00:09:14.759 --> 00:09:17.440
But what we do know is that these events illustrate

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:21.480
how quickly the world can become unglued

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.840
and become completely faint out of fear.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:28.720
And we also know that just as Jesus needed the full support

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.759
of His apostles as it got closer to the end of His life,

00:09:32.759 --> 00:09:36.279
the same as needed today as we get closer to the end.

00:09:36.279 --> 00:09:38.799
The governing body, our branch committees,

00:09:38.799 --> 00:09:41.360
the brothers who are taking the lead, they need our support.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.759
They need us not as a stumbling block,

00:09:43.759 --> 00:09:47.240
not as distractors, but fully behind them.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.600
So dear brothers and sisters, we say to you

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.000
continue to do exactly what you have been doing.

00:09:54.039 --> 00:09:58.320
Stay calm, stay united, trust Jehovah

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.759
and trust the channel Jehovah is using.

00:10:01.759 --> 00:10:05.879
And if we do, we will be thinking Jehovah's thoughts

00:10:05.879 --> 00:10:07.279
and not those of men.
