00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:11.179
The book of Joel contains only 73 verses, but the book reveals so much about Joel,

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:12.179
but doesn't it?

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.179
Absolutely.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.179
So let's dig in.

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:16.179
What would you like to start?

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:22.179
Well, we don't know much about Joel as a person since he recorded very little about himself.

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:26.179
So this is a great opportunity to dig into the historical context.

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:27.179
Great idea.

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:28.179
Where did you find it?

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.179
Well, I found the history recorded in Second King's very interesting.

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:39.179
In Chapter 15, verse 4, it says that under King Aziraya, the high places were not removed,

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:44.179
and the people were still sacrificing and making sacrificial smoke on the high places.

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:50.179
So Judah had a good king, but the nation was still steeped in false worship.

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:53.179
It seems that Joel prophesied during that time.

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:55.179
I wonder what that was like.

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:57.179
I thought about the high places too.

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:03.179
The inside book, under the heading high places, says that they could be found not only on hills and mountains,

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:08.180
but also in the valleys, in stream beds and cities, and under the trees,

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.180
and that frequently those high places were scenes of disgusting sexual practices,

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.180
including ceremonial prostitution and child sacrifice.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.180
No wonder Jehovah hated false worship.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:29.180
It must have pained him so much to watch his own people deliberately engage in a decade after decade.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.180
I wonder how Joel felt seeing this taking place all around him.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.180
How many people did he personally know who were affected by this false worship?

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.180
Maybe he wondered where the nation was headed, and how long Jehovah was going to put up with it.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.180
Well, he didn't have to wonder indefinitely.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:53.180
Jehovah takes action, and he gives Joel this vivid prophecy about the awe-inspiring day of Jehovah.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.180
Imagine what that must have been like.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.180
The locust swarms that invade and strip the beautiful land of Judah bear,

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:07.180
the clouds and thick gloom, the sun and moon turning dark, and then complete restoration.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.180
Wow.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:13.180
That must have been so moving for Joel.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:20.180
Jehovah gave Joel an outstanding glimpse of the discipline and the restoration that was in store for Israel.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.180
This must have been so reassuring to Joel, and it must have greatly affected the way he delivered that message.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:34.180
Think about this. It's possible that Joel was the very first prophet that Jehovah told about that great day.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.180
That brings up another great way to find treasure.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:44.180
Look for Jehovah's actions, and when he took the action, Jehovah's actions reveal his character.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.180
Oh, that's a great point.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.180
So, Jehovah gives Joel this incredible message, but when?

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:59.180
Look at the timing, about 820 BCE, more than 200 years before Jerusalem was destroyed.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.180
So, think about that.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:08.180
Jehovah warms his people of what is coming, and then gives them plenty of time to repent and to respond.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.180
Jehovah's so patient.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.180
Even with people who should know better, even with people who deliberately hurt him and hurt others.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.180
So, we can say that even when provoked, Jehovah is patient.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.180
Yes. And let's keep going with that thought.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:31.180
He also says something about Jehovah's sovereignty. He's all powerful, but he doesn't force anyone to make changes.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.180
Even his own people. Jehovah is not a tyrant. He appeals. He doesn't force.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.180
And we can go further. Jehovah is impartial in exercising patience.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.180
He wanted the nation of Israel to respond to the warning, but it wasn't just the nation as a whole.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:57.180
Speaking of a later time, at Joel 232, Jehovah says, and everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:05.180
He's appealing to all humans to repent and trust Jehovah's forgiveness. Not as a collective, but as individuals.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.180
Every one who calls.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.180
That is a great point. Let me make a note of that.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.180
Everyone who means individuals.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.180
What a beautiful treasure about Jehovah and his sovereignty.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:25.180
So now, the next step. Make personal application. How does this all affect us?

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:32.180
This makes me think, how real is Jehovah's day to me? Is it as vivid as it was to Joel?

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.180
Does my share in the ministry reflect that same sense of urgency?

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:44.180
And when I preach, am I impartial like Jehovah? Or do I perhaps avoid preaching to certain cultures or classes of people?

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:53.180
Yeah, at Romans 10, 13, 14, Paul quoted Joel 232 and asked, how will they hear without someone to preach?

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:59.180
We allow Jehovah to appeal to all individuals when we preach impartially.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:05.180
And speaking of impartiality, what if someone in the congregation has an irritating personality trait?

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:12.180
It may be easy to be patient with our close friends, but what about brothers and sisters who get on our last nerve?

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.180
Yeah, it's easy to be selective with our patients.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:21.180
But even if we're being provoked, what would it say about me if Jehovah's being patient with that brother and sister?

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.180
Yet I'm not.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.180
Or what if we have oversight on the congregation?

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:31.180
When I give direction or need a council, do I force or do I appeal?

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.180
Jehovah isn't a tyrant. Am I imitating the way Jehovah treats people?

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.180
Wow. Look at what just a few steps can lead to.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:47.180
Researching the historical context, looking for what actions Jehovah takes and when, and making personal application.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:53.180
And there's still so much more. Like for instance, what do the locusts and Joel's prophecy represent?

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.180
Why did Jehovah want Israel to rip apart their hearts?

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.180
What can we learn about humility from Joel?

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.180
We haven't even scratched the surface yet.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.180
So let's keep going. You know, something else I was thinking.
