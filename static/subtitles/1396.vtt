00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.750
I've tried everything to get day two a meeting.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:20.600
It's every Thursday and Sunday, and I think you do it into it.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.399
I can't promise anything.

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:26.449
It would be nice if you could come.

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:37.789
It's actually a reminder.

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:47.420
Have you tried bringing other people on the study?

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.210
Well, maybe not everything.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.009
What are you doing tomorrow after me?

00:00:53.009 --> 00:01:29.810
A long time since I hear them.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.010
You know that band?

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.010
No, them.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.010
I used to see them all the time before I'm a witness.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.010
No way.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.010
You know that kind of music.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.010
You don't believe me?

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:54.010
Anything.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.290
Happy gay?

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:02.890
I was young.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.640
You were in a band.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:24.099
Actually, have that vinyl.

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.099
I'll be gone next week, but I'll have someone else take care of the study.

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:29.099
It's okay.
