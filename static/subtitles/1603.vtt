00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.879
Jericho fell and Rahab and her family were spared.

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.880
Jehovah had decreed that everything in the city be destroyed,

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.880
though all the silver and gold were to be delivered to his treasury.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.879
No one was to take anything for himself.

00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:47.250
Aiken, what is it?

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.250
Why are you looking so smug?

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.250
We are rich, dear one.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.250
Rich?

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.250
What are you talking about?

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.250
See for yourselves.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.259
Give that to me.

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:04.260
That's mine.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
You have done well, my husband.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.260
I took it from the rich, selfish, ungodly canonites.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
Did anyone see you?

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
No, I was careful.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.260
Are you sure?

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.260
Yes.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
No one could possibly know.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.260
Father, this will give us a good start in the promised land.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
But we must hide all of these treasures.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.260
Yes, keep them hidden.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.260
What no one sees, no one knows.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
Agreed?

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
Come then.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:57.170
Let us hide all of it.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.170
When we attacked the city of AI, we suffered defeat.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.170
Jehovah then revealed that someone had taken something that was to be destroyed

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.169
and had stolen gold and silver meant for Jehovah's treasury.

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:16.169
The next morning, Jehovah had all Israel come near,

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:23.169
tribe by tribe, family by family, household by household, man by man.

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:31.020
Finally, Jehovah revealed the disobedient man, my son.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:39.020
My Lord, please honor Jehovah the God of Israel and make confession to him.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.020
Tell me, please, what you have done.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.020
Do not hide it from me.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:54.430
For a fact, I am the one who sinned against Jehovah the God of Israel.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.430
When I saw among the spoil of Jehovah an official garment from Shiner,

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.430
such a good-looking one.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.430
And?

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.430
Yes.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.430
And two hundred checkles of silver.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.430
Go on.

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.430
Yes.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.430
And one gold bar weighing fifty checkles.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.430
Aiken, why did you take them?

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.430
I desired them.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.430
So I took them.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.430
But why?

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.430
Look at me.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.430
Did you not hear the same words we all heard?

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.430
The instructions were clear.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.430
The city was to be devoted to destruction.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:46.430
Were you not aware that it and everything in it belonged to Jehovah?

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.430
Yes.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.430
I was.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.430
And yet you stole these things?

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.430
Yes.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.430
Why?

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.430
What does this garment from Shiner mean to you?

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.430
It was...

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.430
You have to see it, Jehovah.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.430
It is beautiful.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.430
It is one whole piece.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.430
The finest material.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.430
Fit for a king.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.430
I have never seen such brilliant colors.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.430
Enough, my son.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.430
Enough.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.430
Tell me.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.430
Where is it?

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.430
It is hidden in the ground.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.430
Inside my tent.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.430
With the money underneath it.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.430
Go, Ishbak.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.430
See if these words are true.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.430
Netavaya, go and find his family.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:46.430
Aiken, did you not know that Jehovah would see you?

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.430
I didn't think of that.

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.430
You had no need of these things.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.430
You have a bowl and a donkey and a flock.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.709
I don't know what to say.

00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:20.790
For a fact, I have sinned against Jehovah the God of Israel.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.790
Why have you brought disaster upon us?

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:29.790
Jehovah will bring disaster upon you on this day.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:36.220
Netavaya, take them away.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:42.220
Jehovah warned that willful disobedience brings bad consequences.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.220
Aiken's case shows that in this way too,

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.220
Jehovah's word never fails.
