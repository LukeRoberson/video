00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.099
Welcome to JW Broadcasting.

00:00:04.099 --> 00:00:07.099
What do we have for you on this month's program?

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:10.099
We'll hear the story of Cecil Goff,

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:15.099
an elder and regular pioneer with over 80 years in Jehovah's service.

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:21.100
What valuable lessons from his experience can you apply to your life and ministry?

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:27.100
Whether we are young or old, how can we make good decisions when choosing entertainment?

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:34.100
In this traumatization, we'll see how a young brother named Danny learns the value of sewing

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.100
what is wholesome in his mind.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.100
Has a challenge in your life ever been so severe that you felt overwhelmed?

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:52.100
When anxiety stirs within us, this new music video can reassure us of Jehovah's loving support.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.100
This is JW Broadcasting for September 2018.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:21.040
We start this month with a story of brother Cecil Goff.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.040
Cecil is 99 years old and has served Jehovah for over 80 years.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.040
He spent many of those years in full-time service.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.040
He had the privilege to serve at Brooklyn Bethel as a circuit overseer,

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.040
as a Gilead train missionary, and as a branch overseer in Cuba.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.040
As you watch his interview, try to determine why he's convinced

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:52.040
that his life in Jehovah's service was more rewarding than anything the world had to offer.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.040
My name is Cecil Joseph Goff.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.040
I begin to lose eyesight in the seventh is I can't see to read anything.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.040
I see on a peripheral vision.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.039
I was playing in a country band at very young age.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.039
Well, I played there, Tenor Bancho, Tenor Guitar, and I played the Mandolin.

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:18.039
It was my life.

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:23.039
And yet, when I began reading and studying really there, I wanted to stick with that,

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:26.039
and I left the band.

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:32.039
I started pioneering, and then they assigned me to Texas.

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:38.039
And another brother was stopped, as we were holding the phonograph up,

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:41.039
and I was playing it for a lady at the door.

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:45.039
Why hear about 15 or 20 men surrounded me?

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:47.039
I asked him, I had to enjoy it.

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:49.039
He says, that's not the question.

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:51.039
My question is, do you salute the flag?

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:54.039
And I said, let me explain you, so I don't want an explanation.

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:56.039
I just want to know, yes or no.

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:58.039
Do you or do you not?

00:02:58.039 --> 00:03:00.039
I said, I do not.

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:04.039
I threw him up in the air, I fell on my back, in the street there,

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:06.039
and then about three of them got on top of me,

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:08.039
and says, you're going to salute the flag or eat it.

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:10.039
Bring me that flag over there.

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:13.039
I was praying that you hover to remember me in the resurrection.

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:18.039
About that time, several women run out of the houses on both sides of us,

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:20.039
and let those men alone.

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:23.039
They didn't bother you. Let them alone. Let them go.

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:27.039
So they got off of me, and they left us like a bunch of beaten kittens.

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:30.039
I was asked to go to Brooklyn, Bethel,

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:32.039
and become a member of the Bethel home.

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:35.039
Brother Norr asked me, you know how to use the typewriter,

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:37.039
and I said, yes, I can type.

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:40.039
He says, well, I'm going to put you on a machine.

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:42.039
It's called a line of type.

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:45.039
There's three keyboards, and he says,

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:47.039
it'll take you about two years to learn it.

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:48.039
Are you willing to accept it?

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:50.039
And I said, yes, I will.

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:53.039
So I was put on the line of the type.

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:56.039
And I got married in the fall of 1945,

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:58.039
left Bethel.

00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:03.039
Well, we were invited in 1949 to go into the circuit work.

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:05.039
We were in the 21st class of Gillard,

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:07.039
we enjoyed that course very much.

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:10.039
We received an assignment for Cuba,

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:13.039
and I was assigned as a branch overseer.

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:16.040
And in 63,

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:22.040
the police car came up to the branch about 10 o'clock at night.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.040
I was told to take my papers and we went over to the police station,

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.040
so forth.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.040
And sure enough, soon thereafter,

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.040
here come in an official,

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.040
said that you're having to leave Cuba

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.040
because you're not in favor of the Cuban government.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.040
The person asked,

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.040
a policeman standing close by,

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.040
this says, who are these people

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.040
that are being sent out of the country?

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.040
And this says, over there,

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.040
he's talking about me.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.040
See that gangster man over there?

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.040
He's ahead of it.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.040
So what then we got on the plane

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.040
and we headed back,

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.040
a guy didn't contact with Brooklyn Bethel.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.040
He talked to brother-in-law and he says,

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.040
as soon as you can,

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.040
next day or two,

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.040
come back to Bethel.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.040
Brother North said you got back just in time

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.040
to get back on the landing-time machine

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.040
and set up a new book we have in Spanish.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.040
So I did that, he got on the landing-time.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.040
And then brother-in-law told Mrs.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.040
in 1964,

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.040
we're going to have a 10-month course in Gillard,

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.040
for all branch people who had branch experience.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.040
Oh, it was very, very good.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.040
We studied a lot of,

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.040
not only the Bible,

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.040
we studied a lot on the Bible,

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.040
discourses and everything.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.040
But we studied a lot of branch material too.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.040
Above everything else,

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.040
our lover, Jehovah,

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.040
should continue to grow.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.040
He knows our thoughts,

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.040
our mind, our heart.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.040
He goes far beyond what man can do.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.040
And whatever his decision is,

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.040
he learned to understand it's the best decision.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.040
I have learned that if we obey

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.040
what the organization says,

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.040
what the Bible says,

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.040
then we're doing Jehovah's will,

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.040
and that's my concern.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.040
No regret.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.040
It's whatever.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.040
None.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.040
Maybe I could have done more at times,

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.040
but I'm certainly glad that I have taken advantage of it,

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.040
as much as I have up from now.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.040
And it's been a happy life.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.040
And I have seen Jehovah's hand

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.040
time and again.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.209
Brother Goff has led a full,

00:06:26.209 --> 00:06:29.209
happy life in theocratic service.

00:06:29.209 --> 00:06:31.209
But do you wonder,

00:06:31.209 --> 00:06:34.209
how is he able to persevere for so many years,

00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:37.209
and through so many different assignments?

00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:39.209
Cecil learned the value

00:06:39.209 --> 00:06:41.209
of letting Jehovah and his organization

00:06:41.209 --> 00:06:44.209
shape his thinking.

00:06:44.209 --> 00:06:46.209
But he had to make a choice as a young man.

00:06:46.209 --> 00:06:50.209
A choice all of Jehovah's servants have to make.

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:54.209
And that's the basis for our discussion this month.

00:06:54.209 --> 00:06:56.209
The theme is,

00:06:56.209 --> 00:07:00.209
stop being molded by this system of things.

00:07:00.209 --> 00:07:02.209
In describing Godly wisdom,

00:07:02.209 --> 00:07:06.209
the ancient man Job recognized it as priceless.

00:07:06.209 --> 00:07:08.209
At Job 28 17, he said,

00:07:08.209 --> 00:07:13.209
gold and glass cannot be compared to it.

00:07:13.209 --> 00:07:17.209
Glass has been around for centuries,

00:07:17.209 --> 00:07:19.209
even back in Job's day.

00:07:19.209 --> 00:07:22.209
However, what revolutionized glass production

00:07:22.209 --> 00:07:25.209
was the invention of glass blowing.

00:07:25.209 --> 00:07:27.209
By blowing through a hollow tube,

00:07:27.209 --> 00:07:31.209
a glass bowler can quickly mold superheated molded glass

00:07:31.209 --> 00:07:35.209
into a specific shape.

00:07:35.209 --> 00:07:38.209
Satan's system has developed the art

00:07:38.209 --> 00:07:40.209
of shaping the minds of people

00:07:40.209 --> 00:07:43.209
into fragile glass vessels

00:07:43.209 --> 00:07:46.209
with little useful purpose.

00:07:46.209 --> 00:07:49.209
In fact, Romans 9.22 refers to such ones

00:07:49.209 --> 00:07:52.209
as vessels of wrath

00:07:52.209 --> 00:07:54.209
made fit for destruction.

00:07:54.209 --> 00:07:59.519
Find with me Romans 12.2.

00:07:59.519 --> 00:08:02.519
What is responsible for molding and shaping

00:08:02.519 --> 00:08:06.519
the inclinations of the people of the world?

00:08:06.519 --> 00:08:08.519
Romans 12.2.

00:08:08.519 --> 00:08:11.519
And stop being molded by this system of things

00:08:11.519 --> 00:08:16.519
but be transformed by making your mind over

00:08:16.519 --> 00:08:18.519
so that you may prove to yourselves

00:08:18.519 --> 00:08:20.519
the good and acceptable

00:08:20.519 --> 00:08:23.519
and perfect will of God.

00:08:23.519 --> 00:08:25.519
To counteract being molded,

00:08:25.519 --> 00:08:26.519
the verse said,

00:08:26.519 --> 00:08:30.519
but be transformed by making your mind over.

00:08:30.519 --> 00:08:32.519
So the molding of this system

00:08:32.519 --> 00:08:34.519
is related to our thinking,

00:08:34.519 --> 00:08:37.519
the shaping of our minds.

00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:42.519
But what evil air is blown down the hollow tube?

00:08:42.519 --> 00:08:45.519
It's identified quite clearly for us

00:08:45.519 --> 00:08:50.379
in Ephesians 2, 2, and 3.

00:08:50.379 --> 00:08:52.379
Concernary to Christians previous

00:08:52.379 --> 00:08:54.379
unclean thinking and behavior,

00:08:54.379 --> 00:08:56.379
verse 2 says,

00:08:56.379 --> 00:08:58.379
in which you at one time walked

00:08:58.379 --> 00:09:01.379
according to the system of things of this world,

00:09:01.379 --> 00:09:05.379
according to the ruler of the authority of the air,

00:09:05.379 --> 00:09:08.379
the spirit that is now at work

00:09:08.379 --> 00:09:11.379
in the sons of disobedience.

00:09:11.379 --> 00:09:14.379
The verse makes clear that this system of things

00:09:14.379 --> 00:09:16.379
has a ruler.

00:09:16.379 --> 00:09:20.379
The ruler of the authority of the air,

00:09:20.379 --> 00:09:22.379
the verse indicates that the air

00:09:22.379 --> 00:09:24.379
is the spirit of the world.

00:09:24.379 --> 00:09:26.379
But with such a mindset,

00:09:26.379 --> 00:09:31.379
what kind of behavior does the thinking of the world lead to?

00:09:31.379 --> 00:09:32.379
Verse 3,

00:09:32.379 --> 00:09:34.379
Yes, among them,

00:09:34.379 --> 00:09:37.379
we all at one time conducted ourselves

00:09:37.379 --> 00:09:41.379
in harmony with the desires of our flesh,

00:09:41.379 --> 00:09:43.379
carrying out the will of the flesh,

00:09:43.379 --> 00:09:45.379
and of our thoughts,

00:09:45.379 --> 00:09:47.379
and we were naturally children of wrath

00:09:47.379 --> 00:09:49.379
just as the rest.

00:09:49.379 --> 00:09:51.379
For this reason, they become

00:09:51.379 --> 00:09:53.379
the vessels of wrath

00:09:53.379 --> 00:09:56.379
made fit for destruction.

00:09:56.379 --> 00:10:00.379
Glassblowers often work in groups known as shops.

00:10:00.379 --> 00:10:03.379
An apprentice dips a hollow blowpipe

00:10:03.379 --> 00:10:05.379
into the liquid glass.

00:10:05.379 --> 00:10:07.379
By twirling it,

00:10:07.379 --> 00:10:10.379
he gathers a blob of molten glass.

00:10:10.379 --> 00:10:11.379
He shapes the blob

00:10:11.379 --> 00:10:13.379
by rolling it on a smooth surface

00:10:13.379 --> 00:10:15.379
called a marver.

00:10:15.379 --> 00:10:17.379
He then passes the tube to the gaffer

00:10:17.379 --> 00:10:19.379
or shop master.

00:10:19.379 --> 00:10:21.379
He blows air into the tube

00:10:21.379 --> 00:10:23.379
and fashions the glass into a globe.

00:10:23.379 --> 00:10:26.379
Well, if a wine glass is being made,

00:10:26.379 --> 00:10:29.379
the tube is then passed to the stem maker,

00:10:29.379 --> 00:10:32.379
and another gather of glass is attached.

00:10:32.379 --> 00:10:35.379
It's then shaped by means of long pointed tongs

00:10:35.379 --> 00:10:38.379
to form the stem.

00:10:38.379 --> 00:10:40.379
Then another gather of hot glass

00:10:40.379 --> 00:10:42.379
is added to the stem.

00:10:42.379 --> 00:10:45.379
The craftsman rolls the tube on the arm of his chair.

00:10:45.379 --> 00:10:49.379
He forms the base of the glass.

00:10:49.379 --> 00:10:52.379
We will briefly consider four ways

00:10:52.379 --> 00:10:55.379
that this system subtly tries to shape our mind

00:10:55.379 --> 00:10:58.379
into Satan's designs.

00:10:58.379 --> 00:11:02.379
The first is harmful peer pressure.

00:11:02.379 --> 00:11:06.379
Now often this is just an apprentice in Satan's shop.

00:11:06.379 --> 00:11:08.379
Maybe fellow students in school,

00:11:08.379 --> 00:11:10.379
fellow workers on the job.

00:11:10.379 --> 00:11:13.379
Don't you think Satan will try to capitalize

00:11:13.379 --> 00:11:16.379
on these circumstantial relationships?

00:11:16.379 --> 00:11:18.379
Absolutely.

00:11:18.379 --> 00:11:20.379
Peer pressure.

00:11:20.379 --> 00:11:23.379
It can have an influence on our mind.

00:11:23.379 --> 00:11:26.379
They may make fun of our wholesome morals,

00:11:26.379 --> 00:11:29.379
our clean speech, our dignified dress.

00:11:29.379 --> 00:11:31.379
That is pressure.

00:11:31.379 --> 00:11:33.379
Possibly they invite us to do things

00:11:33.379 --> 00:11:36.379
that we know will lead to no good.

00:11:36.379 --> 00:11:39.379
They are twirling us with their thinking,

00:11:39.379 --> 00:11:41.379
with their taunts,

00:11:41.379 --> 00:11:44.379
or maybe with their flattery and temptation.

00:11:44.379 --> 00:11:50.360
They are rolling things over and over in our mind.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:55.700
Turn to 2nd Peter, 2 18 and 19.

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.700
And as you read this,

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:01.700
can you pick out a word that's equivalent to peer pressure?

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.700
Let's read 2nd Peter 2 18 and 19.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.700
They make high sounding statements

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:10.700
that are empty, like air.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:12.700
By peeling to the desires of the flesh

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.700
and with acts of brazen conduct,

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:15.700
they entice.

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.700
That's peer pressure.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.700
They entice people who have just escaped

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.700
from those who live an error.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.700
While they are promising them freedom,

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.700
they themselves are slaves of corruption.

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:31.700
For if anyone is overcome by someone,

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:34.700
he is his slave.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:35.700
The verse says,

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:38.700
if we're overcome by peer pressure enticed,

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.700
we actually become a slave of that person.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:42.700
That is scary.

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:44.700
It's dangerous.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:48.700
Peer pressure is deceptively strong.

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.700
But what is another way that the spirit of this system

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.700
can shape our thinking?

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.700
You recall the apprentice passed the glass-blowing tube

00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:00.700
to the gaffer who blew air into the glass,

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.700
giving it shape.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.700
What does Satan and this system next use

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.700
to mold our thinking?

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.700
Enticing advertisements.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.700
Like the air of a glass-blower,

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:17.700
advertisements often have little substance.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.700
For example, that product we decided to buy

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:22.700
when we last went shopping.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.700
Maybe it was a brand of clothing

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:28.700
or a brand of dry cereal we bought for breakfast.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.700
Is that always purely a personal,

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.700
rational decision on our part?

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.700
Or did advertising subtly

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:40.700
but powerfully affect our choice?

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:42.700
Now it's not that all advertising

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.700
is bad or misleading.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.700
But the more we allow ourselves to be influenced by it,

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.700
the more we are in danger of being led

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.700
into a materialistic way of life.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:57.700
For example, instead of dry cereal,

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:02.700
are we now influenced to buy that flashy looking sports car?

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.700
Turn to 1 John 2 15 through 17.

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:12.779
This system inflates our thinking by means of things.

00:14:12.779 --> 00:14:15.779
1 John 2 15 and 16.

00:14:15.779 --> 00:14:19.779
Do not love either the world or the things in the world.

00:14:19.779 --> 00:14:21.779
If anyone loves the world,

00:14:21.779 --> 00:14:23.779
the love of the Father is not in him,

00:14:23.779 --> 00:14:26.779
because everything in the world,

00:14:26.779 --> 00:14:28.779
the desire of the flesh,

00:14:28.779 --> 00:14:30.779
and the desire of the eyes,

00:14:30.779 --> 00:14:33.779
and the showy display of one's means of life,

00:14:33.779 --> 00:14:35.779
not originate with the Father,

00:14:35.779 --> 00:14:38.779
but originates with the world.

00:14:38.779 --> 00:14:40.779
Why do we need to resist catering

00:14:40.779 --> 00:14:44.779
to advertisements that feed the spirit of the world?

00:14:44.779 --> 00:14:47.779
Verse 17.

00:14:47.779 --> 00:14:50.779
Furthermore, the world is passing away,

00:14:50.779 --> 00:14:53.779
and so is its desire.

00:14:53.779 --> 00:14:58.779
But the one who does the will of God remains forever.

00:14:58.779 --> 00:15:00.779
Remember Eve.

00:15:00.779 --> 00:15:03.779
Satan advertised the forbidden fruit.

00:15:03.779 --> 00:15:07.779
The scripture says it was desirable to the eyes

00:15:07.779 --> 00:15:10.779
that tree was pleasing to look at.

00:15:10.779 --> 00:15:13.779
She succumbed to the advertisement

00:15:13.779 --> 00:15:16.779
with disastrous results.

00:15:16.779 --> 00:15:18.779
Similarly, Satan used advertisements

00:15:18.779 --> 00:15:21.779
to try to reshape Jesus' focus.

00:15:21.779 --> 00:15:25.779
Matthew 4 says that Satan showed him

00:15:25.779 --> 00:15:27.779
all the kingdoms of the world,

00:15:27.779 --> 00:15:29.779
offering them an exchange

00:15:29.779 --> 00:15:33.419
of one act of worship.

00:15:33.419 --> 00:15:39.429
Jesus simply turned him off.

00:15:39.429 --> 00:15:43.429
Don't be overly influenced by advertisements.

00:15:43.429 --> 00:15:46.429
But what's the next aspect of the system

00:15:46.429 --> 00:15:49.429
that can distort our minds?

00:15:49.429 --> 00:15:51.429
Bad associations.

00:15:51.429 --> 00:15:53.429
It is as if the gaffer has now passed

00:15:53.429 --> 00:15:56.429
the glass-blowing tube to the stem maker.

00:15:56.429 --> 00:15:59.429
He takes another gather of molten glass

00:15:59.429 --> 00:16:02.429
and attaches it to our globe.

00:16:02.429 --> 00:16:05.429
Then he stretches that associated blob

00:16:05.429 --> 00:16:08.429
into the form of a stem.

00:16:08.429 --> 00:16:11.429
Well, we already talked about pure pressure.

00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:13.429
But that often comes from those

00:16:13.429 --> 00:16:16.429
who are not necessarily our close associates.

00:16:16.429 --> 00:16:18.429
What we're discussing now

00:16:18.429 --> 00:16:23.429
is our decisions about whom we spend a lot of time with.

00:16:23.429 --> 00:16:25.429
People who don't love Jehovah

00:16:25.429 --> 00:16:28.429
can stretch and misshape our minds,

00:16:28.429 --> 00:16:30.429
providing a stem or a handle

00:16:30.429 --> 00:16:33.429
for the world to hold us by.

00:16:33.429 --> 00:16:36.429
Turn to 1 Corinthians 1533.

00:16:36.429 --> 00:16:41.350
Sometimes we hear the phrase

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:43.350
that some of the kids in school

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:46.350
are nicer than some of the kids in the congregation.

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:51.350
But usually nicer actually means more fun

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:54.350
rather than more wholesome.

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:59.350
But let's look at 1 Corinthians 1533 in its context.

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:01.350
What do the Apostle Paul mean

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:03.350
when he said to the Corinthians

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:06.349
bad associations?

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:09.349
1 Corinthians 1533.

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:11.349
Do not be misled.

00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:15.349
Bad associations spoil useful habits.

00:17:15.349 --> 00:17:19.349
But what made these ones bad association?

00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:21.349
Let's see it in context.

00:17:21.349 --> 00:17:25.349
Look at 1 Corinthians 1512.

00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:27.349
Now, if it is being preached

00:17:27.349 --> 00:17:30.349
that Christ has been raised from the dead,

00:17:30.349 --> 00:17:32.349
how is it that some among you say

00:17:32.349 --> 00:17:35.349
there is no resurrection of the dead?

00:17:35.349 --> 00:17:37.349
Well, what was the initial problem

00:17:37.349 --> 00:17:39.349
with these associates?

00:17:39.349 --> 00:17:42.349
They did not believe the same way.

00:17:42.349 --> 00:17:45.349
Well, why would that make them bad associations?

00:17:45.349 --> 00:17:48.349
Because when an associate believes

00:17:48.349 --> 00:17:51.349
will eventually affect our thinking

00:17:51.349 --> 00:17:55.349
and our thinking affects our behavior.

00:17:55.349 --> 00:17:58.349
Notice how Paul describes this.

00:17:58.349 --> 00:18:01.349
Look at 1 Corinthians 1532.

00:18:01.349 --> 00:18:04.349
What good is it to endure the rigors

00:18:04.349 --> 00:18:06.349
of the Christian race for life

00:18:06.349 --> 00:18:08.349
if there is no resurrection,

00:18:08.349 --> 00:18:10.349
no future, no hope?

00:18:10.349 --> 00:18:12.349
Verse 32.

00:18:12.349 --> 00:18:13.349
If like other men I have fought

00:18:13.349 --> 00:18:15.349
with wild beasts at Ephesus,

00:18:15.349 --> 00:18:18.349
of what good is it to me?

00:18:18.349 --> 00:18:20.349
If the dead are not to be raised up,

00:18:20.349 --> 00:18:22.349
let us eat and drink.

00:18:22.349 --> 00:18:24.349
For tomorrow we are to die.

00:18:24.349 --> 00:18:27.349
May all of us avoid bad association

00:18:27.349 --> 00:18:30.349
whether in person, on TV,

00:18:30.349 --> 00:18:33.349
or on the internet.

00:18:33.349 --> 00:18:35.349
What is a fourth means

00:18:35.349 --> 00:18:37.349
by which Satan attempts to fashion us,

00:18:37.349 --> 00:18:39.349
reshaping our thinking?

00:18:39.349 --> 00:18:42.349
Higher education.

00:18:42.349 --> 00:18:45.349
Most of us remember the January 2015

00:18:45.349 --> 00:18:49.349
JW Broadcasting program hosted by Brother Morris

00:18:49.349 --> 00:18:51.349
of the governing body.

00:18:51.349 --> 00:18:55.349
He focused on the value of divine education.

00:18:55.349 --> 00:18:57.349
But he also reaffirmed

00:18:57.349 --> 00:19:01.349
the dangers of pursuing higher secular education.

00:19:01.349 --> 00:19:04.349
Its whole purpose is for learning,

00:19:04.349 --> 00:19:06.349
influencing one's thinking.

00:19:06.349 --> 00:19:08.349
And will a person's intention

00:19:08.349 --> 00:19:11.349
might be just to create a stable base

00:19:11.349 --> 00:19:13.349
for a secular future?

00:19:13.349 --> 00:19:15.349
His decision could expose him

00:19:15.349 --> 00:19:19.349
to unscriptural ideas and practices.

00:19:20.349 --> 00:19:22.349
Back to the glass shop.

00:19:22.349 --> 00:19:25.349
Recall that another gather of hot glass

00:19:25.349 --> 00:19:27.349
is added to the end of the stem?

00:19:27.349 --> 00:19:29.349
The craftsman then rolls the two

00:19:29.349 --> 00:19:31.349
backwards and forward.

00:19:31.349 --> 00:19:35.349
He forms the base for the glass.

00:19:35.349 --> 00:19:38.349
Well, we will say no more about this topic

00:19:38.349 --> 00:19:41.349
other than what Brother Morris has already shared.

00:19:41.349 --> 00:19:43.349
You might want to go back

00:19:43.349 --> 00:19:45.349
and review that broadcast.

00:19:45.349 --> 00:19:47.349
However, we would like to read

00:19:47.349 --> 00:19:51.349
the first Timothy 6, 2021.

00:19:51.349 --> 00:19:55.349
Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you.

00:19:55.349 --> 00:19:57.349
That's divine education.

00:19:57.349 --> 00:20:00.349
Turning away from the empty speeches

00:20:00.349 --> 00:20:02.349
that violate what is holy

00:20:02.349 --> 00:20:04.349
and from the contradictions

00:20:04.349 --> 00:20:07.349
of the falsely-called knowledge.

00:20:07.349 --> 00:20:09.349
By making a show of such knowledge,

00:20:09.349 --> 00:20:13.349
some have deviated from the faith.

00:20:13.349 --> 00:20:15.349
Unfortunately,

00:20:15.349 --> 00:20:17.349
in an effort to make a stable base

00:20:17.349 --> 00:20:19.349
for one's financial future,

00:20:19.349 --> 00:20:22.349
many have deviated from the faith.

00:20:22.349 --> 00:20:25.950
In the visuals of a glass-blowing shop,

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:29.950
we observed the skill of the workers involved.

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:32.950
And that shop obviously produces beautiful,

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:35.950
useful glass vessels.

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:38.950
Satan's glass shop is also skilled

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:41.950
at shaping one's thinking.

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:43.950
But what does it produce?

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:46.950
Instead of a person becoming a valuable vessel

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:48.950
that Jehovah can use,

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:53.259
Satan is actually mass-producing

00:20:53.259 --> 00:20:56.259
worthless vessels that Jehovah cannot use.

00:20:56.259 --> 00:21:00.259
What could you do with this mishap creation?

00:21:00.259 --> 00:21:04.259
Nothing, it is useless.

00:21:04.259 --> 00:21:07.259
At the outset, Romans 9.22 was quoted.

00:21:07.259 --> 00:21:10.259
Those who conform to Satan's system

00:21:10.259 --> 00:21:13.259
are referred to as vessels of wrath

00:21:13.259 --> 00:21:19.299
and made fit for destruction.

00:21:19.299 --> 00:21:22.299
Jehovah's paid a high price for us.

00:21:22.299 --> 00:21:25.299
Gold and glass cannot be compared to it.

00:21:25.299 --> 00:21:27.299
May we make over our minds

00:21:27.299 --> 00:21:29.299
by applying godly wisdom.

00:21:29.299 --> 00:21:33.299
Glorified Jehovah as a vessel that he can use.

00:21:33.299 --> 00:21:38.299
1 Corinthians 6.20 concludes this discussion nicely saying,

00:21:38.299 --> 00:21:41.299
for you were bought with a price.

00:21:41.299 --> 00:21:45.299
By all means, glorify God in your body.

00:21:46.299 --> 00:21:49.299
May the world try to mold us.

00:21:49.299 --> 00:21:53.299
Another way is through the entertainment it produces.

00:21:53.299 --> 00:21:56.299
How can we choose entertainment that will enhance

00:21:56.299 --> 00:22:00.299
and not taint our sacrifice to Jehovah?

00:22:00.299 --> 00:22:02.299
In the following dramatization,

00:22:02.299 --> 00:22:04.299
notice how a fellow Christian

00:22:04.299 --> 00:22:33.140
helps a young brother to make better choices.

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:42.059
I promised to kill I'd go out and serve us with him after school.

00:22:42.059 --> 00:22:52.269
I kept my word, but my head just wasn't in it.

00:22:52.269 --> 00:22:58.210
Akeel could tell.

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:02.210
So he tried to see if everything was okay.

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:06.259
Honestly, at the time,

00:23:06.259 --> 00:23:10.630
I would have rather been playing video games.

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:15.740
But I couldn't tell him that.

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:17.740
I mean, he's a pioneer.

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:20.740
I'm an hysterial servant.

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:44.089
He wouldn't understand.

00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:45.089
Later that week,

00:23:45.089 --> 00:23:49.089
Akeel invited me to go mountain biking with some friends.

00:23:49.089 --> 00:23:52.089
It was actually really fun.

00:23:52.089 --> 00:24:02.440
So then you're obviously good at biking.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.440
What else do you like to do for fun?

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:09.490
Soon, I was showing him my video games.

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:17.089
And surprisingly,

00:24:17.089 --> 00:24:19.089
he liked video games too.

00:24:19.089 --> 00:24:24.619
But he said he chose to be selective.

00:24:24.619 --> 00:24:29.940
He began to describe the gladiators in ancient Rome.

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:41.559
People would come from all over to watch them fight to the death.

00:24:41.559 --> 00:24:45.900
And while the spectators weren't in any physical danger,

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:48.900
the real danger came over time.

00:24:48.900 --> 00:25:01.059
Repeatedly watching the blood shed and the killing,

00:25:01.059 --> 00:25:04.059
it was dulling their senses.

00:25:04.059 --> 00:25:06.059
And they wanted more of it.

00:25:06.059 --> 00:25:19.660
It was a big test for the Christians who lived back then.

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:24.660
Akeel helped me to reason on the scripture at Romans 12, verse 9.

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:28.450
A poor, what is wicked,

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:31.450
cling to what is good.

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:35.450
So Danny, the games may have changed over time,

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:38.450
but the violence is still the same.

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:40.450
I like video games,

00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:43.450
but I avoid the ones that promote what Jehovah hates.

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:50.670
Jehovah's people can still have fun.

00:25:50.670 --> 00:26:06.900
And yeah, we can even play video games.

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:14.019
I just want to make wise choices.

00:26:14.019 --> 00:26:23.339
And I want to show Jehovah that I hate wickedness

00:26:23.339 --> 00:26:36.059
and make his heart glad.

00:26:36.059 --> 00:26:40.059
This video is part of a series of videos.

00:26:40.059 --> 00:26:43.059
We're pleased to announce that all 17 episodes

00:26:43.059 --> 00:26:49.059
will be made available under a new principles for daily living category.

00:26:49.059 --> 00:26:52.059
It can be found in both the family

00:26:52.059 --> 00:26:55.059
and our meetings and ministry sections.

00:26:55.059 --> 00:26:57.059
As we saw in this episode,

00:26:57.059 --> 00:27:01.059
our choice and entertainment can affect our worship.

00:27:01.059 --> 00:27:05.059
We could be exposing ourselves to Satan's thinking.

00:27:05.059 --> 00:27:09.059
If you're enticed by entertainment that displeases Jehovah,

00:27:09.059 --> 00:27:12.059
what Bible principles will help you?

00:27:12.059 --> 00:27:17.059
Chapter 6 of The God's Love Book features a box entitled,

00:27:17.059 --> 00:27:20.059
What Entertainment Should I Choose?

00:27:20.059 --> 00:27:24.059
Make the scriptures in this feature a matter of prayer

00:27:24.059 --> 00:27:27.059
and discussion in family worship.

00:27:27.059 --> 00:27:31.059
They will help you cling to what is good.

00:27:31.059 --> 00:27:34.059
But at times, clinging to the good

00:27:34.059 --> 00:27:39.059
includes receiving discipline which can be painful.

00:27:39.059 --> 00:27:46.059
How can we look beyond any pain to the benefits of divine correction?

00:27:46.059 --> 00:27:49.059
At a Bethlehem morning worship, Brother Anthony Morris,

00:27:49.059 --> 00:27:51.059
a member of the governing body,

00:27:51.059 --> 00:27:54.059
discussed how a proper view of discipline

00:27:54.059 --> 00:27:57.059
brings us closer to Jehovah.

00:27:57.059 --> 00:28:00.059
This morning I thought I'd discuss the matter

00:28:00.059 --> 00:28:05.059
of a proper view of discipline keeps us close to Jehovah.

00:28:05.059 --> 00:28:09.059
In the context of today's text about Jehovah correcting

00:28:09.059 --> 00:28:11.059
to the proper degree,

00:28:11.059 --> 00:28:15.059
he's talking to us people about being brought back to their land.

00:28:15.059 --> 00:28:18.059
He was not going to exterminate them,

00:28:18.059 --> 00:28:20.059
nor leave them.

00:28:20.059 --> 00:28:23.059
And it helps us to appreciate that he wanted them

00:28:23.059 --> 00:28:26.059
to keep their relationship with him.

00:28:26.059 --> 00:28:31.059
Now, today we received discipline in various ways.

00:28:31.059 --> 00:28:34.059
It might be from personal Bible study.

00:28:34.059 --> 00:28:36.059
And I was excited this morning.

00:28:36.059 --> 00:28:39.059
I don't know when it happened, maybe last night.

00:28:39.059 --> 00:28:42.059
But to see what we have in the JW library,

00:28:42.059 --> 00:28:46.059
we can put our personal notes and get started with some already.

00:28:46.059 --> 00:28:49.059
So that'll be like thoughts discipline

00:28:49.059 --> 00:28:53.059
from Jehovah that is just between him and ourselves.

00:28:53.059 --> 00:28:55.059
Very beneficial.

00:28:55.059 --> 00:28:57.059
The wise way to go when it comes to discipline

00:28:57.059 --> 00:29:01.059
keeps us from veering off in our relationship with him.

00:29:01.059 --> 00:29:04.059
It might be something we read in the publication,

00:29:04.059 --> 00:29:06.059
might hear a talk, at a meeting,

00:29:06.059 --> 00:29:08.059
at an assembly or a convention,

00:29:08.059 --> 00:29:11.059
something in a JW broadcast.

00:29:11.059 --> 00:29:15.059
Various ways, any numbers of ways Jehovah will discipline us.

00:29:16.059 --> 00:29:19.059
And we need to remember he does it

00:29:19.059 --> 00:29:22.059
so that we remain close to him.

00:29:22.059 --> 00:29:26.059
The problem is discipline is not easy to take.

00:29:26.059 --> 00:29:28.059
It requires humility.

00:29:28.059 --> 00:29:34.059
And the proper view of disciplines found here in Proverbs chapter 3.

00:29:34.059 --> 00:29:38.059
And this gives us the scriptural basis

00:29:38.059 --> 00:29:40.059
to have this proper view of discipline

00:29:40.059 --> 00:29:44.059
that'll keep us close to Jehovah God.

00:29:44.059 --> 00:29:49.059
And notice verse 11 and 12 of Proverbs chapter 3.

00:29:49.059 --> 00:29:53.059
My son do not reject the discipline of Jehovah

00:29:53.059 --> 00:29:56.059
and do not loathe his reproof.

00:29:56.059 --> 00:29:59.059
For those whom Jehovah loves, he reproves.

00:29:59.059 --> 00:30:03.059
Just as a father does a son in whom he delights.

00:30:03.059 --> 00:30:08.059
So how might we reject the discipline of Jehovah well?

00:30:08.059 --> 00:30:10.059
Put yourself in a position.

00:30:10.059 --> 00:30:12.059
You're being counseled.

00:30:12.059 --> 00:30:15.059
It's come to the point where overseers,

00:30:15.059 --> 00:30:18.059
elders have had to sit down with you.

00:30:18.059 --> 00:30:22.059
Now, as soon as the council begins to flow,

00:30:22.059 --> 00:30:27.059
there is this quickness to be upset, to justify,

00:30:27.059 --> 00:30:29.059
to feel picked on.

00:30:29.059 --> 00:30:32.059
Well, Jehovah's say, don't reject this.

00:30:32.059 --> 00:30:34.059
And if they're using the scriptures

00:30:34.059 --> 00:30:36.059
and thoughts from publications,

00:30:36.059 --> 00:30:38.059
view it as coming from Jehovah,

00:30:38.059 --> 00:30:41.059
so that we can stay close to him.

00:30:42.059 --> 00:30:47.059
Now, give you an idea of sometimes reading something

00:30:47.059 --> 00:30:49.059
that will bring us close to Jehovah,

00:30:49.059 --> 00:30:53.059
especially if we veered off and didn't even realize it.

00:30:53.059 --> 00:30:56.059
I'm going to go way back to some examples

00:30:56.059 --> 00:31:00.059
of Jehovah's sheep reading something in the watchtower

00:31:00.059 --> 00:31:02.059
and it just disciplined them,

00:31:02.059 --> 00:31:05.059
so that they could get close to Jehovah.

00:31:05.059 --> 00:31:08.059
And it goes way back to 1982

00:31:08.059 --> 00:31:11.059
and had to do with TV serials or soap operas.

00:31:11.059 --> 00:31:15.059
And so I'm going to say, well, that's a long time ago.

00:31:15.059 --> 00:31:18.059
Well, the fact is nothing's changed.

00:31:18.059 --> 00:31:22.059
Some of these soap operas are still on that had the names,

00:31:22.059 --> 00:31:25.059
that they had in 1982, they still have it.

00:31:25.059 --> 00:31:29.059
So many readers personally benefited from the council.

00:31:29.059 --> 00:31:32.059
The council still applies that was found there,

00:31:32.059 --> 00:31:35.059
but I think it's very touching and commendable for the ones

00:31:35.059 --> 00:31:40.059
that read that they recognized that it impacted

00:31:40.059 --> 00:31:41.059
their relationship with Jehovah,

00:31:41.059 --> 00:31:43.059
and they wanted to get close to him.

00:31:43.059 --> 00:31:47.059
Now, the cover on the watchtower was soap operas,

00:31:47.059 --> 00:31:49.059
can they corrupt the heart?

00:31:49.059 --> 00:31:54.059
And in the opening article, we did say millions of women

00:31:54.059 --> 00:31:58.059
and men of all ages, races, and backgrounds

00:31:58.059 --> 00:32:00.059
will rarely miss a show.

00:32:00.059 --> 00:32:03.059
Well, now you can record them and have many times

00:32:03.059 --> 00:32:05.059
that they like.

00:32:05.059 --> 00:32:09.059
It's still an ongoing problem and an issue for a true Christian,

00:32:09.059 --> 00:32:14.059
a worship of Jehovah to make sure we're not being corrupted

00:32:14.059 --> 00:32:17.059
by soap operas, TV serials.

00:32:17.059 --> 00:32:20.059
Now, after the articles came out,

00:32:20.059 --> 00:32:24.059
we had some write-in to explain what happened to them.

00:32:24.059 --> 00:32:28.059
And so months later, after this 1982 issue

00:32:28.059 --> 00:32:32.059
of the watchtower, and that was December 1st,

00:32:32.059 --> 00:32:35.059
we went to 83 watchtower, December 1st,

00:32:35.059 --> 00:32:38.059
and here's the response from some of the readers.

00:32:38.059 --> 00:32:40.059
And I found it very commendable,

00:32:40.059 --> 00:32:43.059
and I think you'll appreciate the humility

00:32:43.059 --> 00:32:45.059
because it takes humility to accept

00:32:45.059 --> 00:32:47.059
and have the proper view of discipline.

00:32:47.059 --> 00:32:52.059
So one of the dangers that the brothers were warned

00:32:52.059 --> 00:32:54.059
about is that you get emotionally attached

00:32:54.059 --> 00:32:57.059
to the characters in the show.

00:32:57.059 --> 00:33:00.059
So here's what Ron wrote.

00:33:00.059 --> 00:33:03.059
I had grown up watching this one soap opera

00:33:03.059 --> 00:33:07.059
and the character Julie was just like my friend.

00:33:07.059 --> 00:33:09.059
One day, Julie had an accident

00:33:09.059 --> 00:33:13.059
that left her beautiful face badly scarred.

00:33:13.059 --> 00:33:16.059
I was in front of the TV set every day

00:33:16.059 --> 00:33:19.059
to make sure she was going to pull through.

00:33:19.059 --> 00:33:23.059
That night, as I was saying my prayers,

00:33:23.059 --> 00:33:25.059
before I even thought what I was saying,

00:33:25.059 --> 00:33:32.059
I prayed, and Jehovah, please bless Julie.

00:33:32.059 --> 00:33:35.059
Well, she admits I was shocked.

00:33:35.059 --> 00:33:38.059
She should have been.

00:33:38.059 --> 00:33:40.059
This plea to Jehovah for Julie

00:33:40.059 --> 00:33:43.059
had come from my heart.

00:33:43.059 --> 00:33:45.059
Realizing how involved she'd become,

00:33:45.059 --> 00:33:48.059
she stopped watching these programs.

00:33:48.059 --> 00:33:51.059
She wrote, if all readers will take your article

00:33:51.059 --> 00:33:53.059
on TV serials to heart,

00:33:53.059 --> 00:33:56.059
they will feel a real sense of freedom.

00:33:56.059 --> 00:34:00.059
Since our own everyday problems are enough to cope with.

00:34:00.059 --> 00:34:04.059
So you see, our sister had the proper view of discipline

00:34:04.059 --> 00:34:08.059
and she was able to keep close to Jehovah.

00:34:08.059 --> 00:34:12.059
Now another one after expressing appreciation wrote,

00:34:12.059 --> 00:34:15.059
I realized that I was addicted to soap operas,

00:34:15.059 --> 00:34:17.059
and that I had to do something about it.

00:34:17.059 --> 00:34:20.059
I wondered too if my relationship with Jehovah

00:34:20.059 --> 00:34:22.059
could be affected.

00:34:22.059 --> 00:34:25.059
How could I have them as friends

00:34:25.059 --> 00:34:27.059
and also be a friend to Jehovah?

00:34:27.059 --> 00:34:29.059
I had to quit all at once.

00:34:29.059 --> 00:34:33.059
It was the only way and how hard it was she admits.

00:34:33.059 --> 00:34:35.059
So what she had to do to break free,

00:34:35.059 --> 00:34:37.059
she had to unplug her TV,

00:34:37.059 --> 00:34:40.059
she'd go outdoors and work in the garden,

00:34:40.059 --> 00:34:43.059
call somebody, anything to stay busy

00:34:43.059 --> 00:34:48.059
so that she wouldn't go back to watching those soap operas.

00:34:48.059 --> 00:34:50.059
She took time for personal Bible study.

00:34:50.059 --> 00:34:52.059
They'll keep you close to Jehovah,

00:34:52.059 --> 00:34:56.059
preparing for her meetings and other spiritual things.

00:34:56.059 --> 00:35:00.059
And then she confesses how much better I felt.

00:35:00.059 --> 00:35:02.059
It has been over two years now,

00:35:02.059 --> 00:35:06.059
this last writing, since I've seen those soul-called friends.

00:35:06.059 --> 00:35:09.059
I must admit that at times I still wonder

00:35:09.059 --> 00:35:11.059
what's going on with them,

00:35:11.059 --> 00:35:13.059
but I fight it.

00:35:13.059 --> 00:35:17.059
Perhaps many others who have not yet broken free will now.

00:35:18.059 --> 00:35:21.059
Jehovah new brothers, or she says thank you,

00:35:21.059 --> 00:35:26.059
Jehovah new brothers for exposing this good for nothing thing.

00:35:26.059 --> 00:35:31.059
And finally this third one says I cried when I read the articles.

00:35:31.059 --> 00:35:36.059
I discovered that my heart was no longer complete toward Jehovah.

00:35:36.059 --> 00:35:40.059
I promised my God that I would no longer be a slave to these cereals

00:35:40.059 --> 00:35:43.059
and asked him to help me to get out of my home

00:35:43.059 --> 00:35:46.059
on the day of the program.

00:35:47.059 --> 00:35:50.059
Two days later I was invited to attend a Bible study

00:35:50.059 --> 00:35:53.059
on the very day and time of my cereal.

00:35:53.059 --> 00:35:59.059
I happily accepted and noticed I now feel closer to Jehovah.

00:35:59.059 --> 00:36:02.059
And my relationship with him is more intimate.

00:36:02.059 --> 00:36:06.059
How good Jehovah is to discipline us through his word.

00:36:06.059 --> 00:36:10.059
Yes, she has the proper view of discipline.

00:36:10.059 --> 00:36:16.559
Now finally let's look at Hebrews chapter 12

00:36:16.559 --> 00:36:19.559
and we appreciate these sincere comments.

00:36:19.559 --> 00:36:22.559
And the counsel there certainly applies

00:36:22.559 --> 00:36:27.559
any kind of entertainment that has that corrupting influence

00:36:27.559 --> 00:36:30.559
would be avoided by a true Christian.

00:36:30.559 --> 00:36:36.559
So here in Hebrews chapter 12, notice verse 11,

00:36:36.559 --> 00:36:40.559
true no discipline seems for the present to be joyous

00:36:40.559 --> 00:36:42.559
but it is painful.

00:36:42.559 --> 00:36:46.559
Yet afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness

00:36:46.559 --> 00:36:48.559
to those who have been trained by it.

00:36:48.559 --> 00:36:53.559
So discipline is painful but the peaceable fruit of righteousness

00:36:53.559 --> 00:36:57.559
makes it worth it to have a proper view of the discipline

00:36:57.559 --> 00:37:02.559
and to accept it humbly so we can remain close

00:37:02.559 --> 00:37:06.559
to our precious father, Jehovah.

00:37:06.559 --> 00:37:09.559
Discipline helps us reshape our thinking and actions,

00:37:09.559 --> 00:37:13.559
drawing us closer to our grand creator.

00:37:13.559 --> 00:37:15.559
It may come from God's word.

00:37:15.559 --> 00:37:18.559
Publications produced by the faithful and discreet slave,

00:37:18.559 --> 00:37:22.559
apparent or mature fellow Christians.

00:37:22.559 --> 00:37:25.559
No matter how we receive discipline,

00:37:25.559 --> 00:37:29.559
always remember what Proverbs 312 says.

00:37:29.559 --> 00:37:32.559
Those whom Jehovah loves he reproves,

00:37:32.559 --> 00:37:36.559
just as a father does a son in whom he delights.

00:37:37.559 --> 00:37:40.559
But what if the world's thinking has molded you

00:37:40.559 --> 00:37:44.559
but not by choice, by circumstance?

00:37:44.559 --> 00:37:48.559
You'll appreciate the story of Sister Guzel Guy Nanchana,

00:37:48.559 --> 00:37:51.559
who was not raised as one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:37:51.559 --> 00:37:54.559
In her youth, Guzel searched for fulfillment

00:37:54.559 --> 00:37:56.559
through competitive sports.

00:37:56.559 --> 00:37:59.559
Even though she achieved some level of success,

00:37:59.559 --> 00:38:04.559
what helped her to find a true purpose in life?

00:38:04.559 --> 00:38:08.559
I lived in the North with the glorious dark,

00:38:08.559 --> 00:38:11.559
starlit sky and the beauty of furtries.

00:38:11.559 --> 00:38:14.559
I thought it was the most wonderful place in the world.

00:38:14.559 --> 00:38:16.559
My mom was always drawing my attention

00:38:16.559 --> 00:38:18.559
to the beauty of creation.

00:38:18.559 --> 00:38:20.559
And she always told me, my daughter,

00:38:20.559 --> 00:38:23.559
it's so important to live your life in the right way.

00:38:23.559 --> 00:38:25.559
And the question that stayed with me was,

00:38:25.559 --> 00:38:27.559
so why are we alive?

00:38:27.559 --> 00:38:30.559
Why is there so much suffering in justice, pain?

00:38:33.059 --> 00:38:36.059
When I was 18, I took up a form of karate known as

00:38:36.059 --> 00:38:38.059
kiu kushinkai.

00:38:39.059 --> 00:38:41.059
Just imagine a large number of people

00:38:41.059 --> 00:38:43.059
in Kamono standing in lows,

00:38:43.059 --> 00:38:45.059
grieving without a shadow of fear working

00:38:45.059 --> 00:38:48.059
on improving their blows and striving to progress.

00:38:48.059 --> 00:38:51.059
I thought, this is it, this is what I've been looking for.

00:38:51.059 --> 00:38:54.059
I set the goal of reaching the next world championships,

00:38:54.059 --> 00:38:57.059
winning a high place and immortalizing myself,

00:38:57.059 --> 00:39:01.059
so that my name would remain and generations would remember me.

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:08.210
Among those sportsmen, I always saw a lot of nice words

00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:14.420
and slogans, not everything was as pure as I'd hoped for.

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:17.420
And then on one occasion, I was sitting down

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:21.420
and feelings of emptiness just wouldn't leave me alone.

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:25.420
And for the first time in my life, I talked to God

00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:31.420
and then I prayed, I don't understand you.

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:35.420
Why is there so much beauty in the world

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:37.420
and get so much suffering?

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:41.420
Is that really what you want for us to live like this?

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:45.420
I prayed, I guess, for about four hours.

00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:48.420
You know, the strongest feeling of emptiness and loneliness

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:52.420
is out of a creation, without its creator.

00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:55.420
And I was so lonely at that time.

00:39:55.420 --> 00:40:01.880
And a while afterwards, there was a knock at my door.

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:06.610
It was Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:40:07.610 --> 00:40:09.610
I started studying the Bible.

00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:13.659
It was so wonderful.

00:40:13.659 --> 00:40:16.659
On one occasion, the sister who studied with me,

00:40:16.659 --> 00:40:19.659
looked up at me and when she looked at those bruises,

00:40:19.659 --> 00:40:22.659
those beaten up knuckles,

00:40:22.659 --> 00:40:25.659
she took a deep breath and shook her head.

00:40:25.659 --> 00:40:28.659
I said, is there something wrong?

00:40:28.659 --> 00:40:31.659
She said, you know, I'm in great pain.

00:40:31.659 --> 00:40:33.659
I said, why are you in pain?

00:40:33.659 --> 00:40:36.659
She said, well, I'm looking at your hands,

00:40:36.659 --> 00:40:39.659
your elbows, your battered legs,

00:40:39.659 --> 00:40:42.659
all of that, doesn't it hurt?

00:40:42.659 --> 00:40:45.659
I said, well, yes.

00:40:45.659 --> 00:40:50.659
And she said, you know, it hurts me to see you in pain.

00:40:50.659 --> 00:40:54.659
And I started to understand that Jehovah is the true God,

00:40:54.659 --> 00:40:57.659
that this really was the truth.

00:40:57.659 --> 00:40:58.659
It was difficult.

00:40:58.659 --> 00:41:02.659
The pressure from relatives and friends was very strong.

00:41:02.659 --> 00:41:05.659
But the most difficult thing that I had to battle with

00:41:05.659 --> 00:41:08.659
was my strong attachment to karate.

00:41:08.659 --> 00:41:11.659
Just a year remained until the World Championships.

00:41:11.659 --> 00:41:13.659
I had prepared for them.

00:41:13.659 --> 00:41:17.659
I had been working toward that goal for five years.

00:41:17.659 --> 00:41:19.659
Glory can seem really sweet.

00:41:19.659 --> 00:41:21.659
When you are the victor,

00:41:21.659 --> 00:41:29.039
when your opponents fall to the ground.

00:41:29.039 --> 00:41:32.039
So I flew to the World Championships.

00:41:32.039 --> 00:41:34.039
When I made it to the last four winners

00:41:34.039 --> 00:41:36.039
and I had to fight for third place,

00:41:36.039 --> 00:41:38.039
I wanted to ask my trainer to stop.

00:41:38.039 --> 00:41:39.039
Why?

00:41:39.039 --> 00:41:43.039
Because I couldn't feel a single life place on my body.

00:41:43.039 --> 00:41:45.039
Everything was beaten up.

00:41:45.039 --> 00:41:47.039
But he said, you know,

00:41:47.039 --> 00:41:49.039
we love you so much.

00:41:49.039 --> 00:41:51.039
Go for it.

00:41:51.039 --> 00:41:52.039
And at that moment,

00:41:52.039 --> 00:41:54.039
it felt as though I was weighing love.

00:41:54.039 --> 00:41:55.039
The world's love

00:41:55.039 --> 00:41:58.039
and the love of Jehovah's organization.

00:41:58.039 --> 00:42:00.039
It seemed to me that the world was saying,

00:42:00.039 --> 00:42:02.039
we love you.

00:42:02.039 --> 00:42:04.039
Now just go and die.

00:42:04.039 --> 00:42:06.039
But the love in the organization says,

00:42:06.039 --> 00:42:09.039
it hurts me to see you in pain.

00:42:09.039 --> 00:42:13.039
I realized that the world can't give you what it doesn't have.

00:42:13.039 --> 00:42:15.039
It doesn't know how to love.

00:42:15.039 --> 00:42:18.039
But nevertheless, I went to the fight

00:42:18.039 --> 00:42:20.039
and became the bronze medalist.

00:42:20.039 --> 00:42:24.960
And when I stood on the podium of glory,

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:27.960
I understood that glory among people

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:31.960
who don't love you weighs no more than emptiness.

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:35.960
If a person dedicates his life to glorifying himself,

00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:40.960
he will always meet with disappointment and emptiness.

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:43.960
So I made the firm decision to escape from karate.

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:45.960
I started preaching,

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:49.960
and I was baptized in 2005 at the summer convention in Kurgans.

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:54.500
Later, I started full-time service.

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.500
I learned the Tatar language

00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:58.500
so that I could serve in that territory.

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:05.099
Now, when in the evenings I look up at the starry sky,

00:43:05.099 --> 00:43:07.099
I feel not hopelessness,

00:43:07.099 --> 00:43:12.099
but tremendous joy because I know who is behind it all.

00:43:12.099 --> 00:43:15.099
Our loving creator, Jehovah God.

00:43:15.099 --> 00:43:25.050
Guzel had been molded by the system of things,

00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:29.050
but she was transformed by making her mind over.

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:34.050
The literal cuts and bruises Guzel suffered, healed with time.

00:43:34.050 --> 00:43:39.050
But she found true comfort from the one described at Psalm 147-3,

00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:41.050
who heals the brokenhearted,

00:43:41.050 --> 00:43:47.050
and who binds up the emotional wounds inflicted by this system of things.

00:43:47.050 --> 00:43:51.050
Her example shows that no matter our situation or background,

00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:56.050
the beautiful truths of God's Word can change us.

00:43:56.050 --> 00:44:00.050
It may feel like a leap of faith to leave behind

00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:04.050
secret pursuits to reach spiritual goals.

00:44:04.050 --> 00:44:08.050
Some have made this leap after investing years of training,

00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:14.050
education, and financial resources towards a career in the world.

00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:16.050
If that's true for you,

00:44:16.050 --> 00:44:20.050
rest assured that you are not alone.

00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:23.050
Our next segment will introduce you to young ones

00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:32.159
who resisted the pressure to conform to the world's view of success.

00:44:32.159 --> 00:44:35.159
Right now I'm serving in the Central America branch

00:44:35.159 --> 00:44:38.159
and I have the opportunity to work with extraordinary brothers and sisters,

00:44:38.159 --> 00:44:41.159
both here and in other parts of the world.

00:44:41.159 --> 00:44:44.159
My name is Rogelio, I'm part of the art department,

00:44:44.159 --> 00:44:47.159
and I'm a digital illustrator.

00:44:47.159 --> 00:44:50.159
Music really means the world to me.

00:44:50.159 --> 00:44:52.159
I am Joyce, I am a pioneer,

00:44:52.159 --> 00:44:55.159
and I sing also in the Bethel Chorus.

00:44:55.159 --> 00:45:01.159
My name is Lil Lenn,

00:45:01.159 --> 00:45:05.159
and I serve as a regular pioneer in a congregation where there's a need.

00:45:05.159 --> 00:45:09.159
I love doing that, my life is wonderful.

00:45:09.159 --> 00:45:13.159
Seeing people's faces light up when you teach them God's name,

00:45:13.159 --> 00:45:16.159
or when you tell them of Jehovah's promises for us,

00:45:16.159 --> 00:45:18.159
fills me with great joy.

00:45:18.159 --> 00:45:20.159
My name is Josue Mape,

00:45:20.159 --> 00:45:24.159
I serve as a regular pioneer and as an elder in the congregation.

00:45:24.159 --> 00:45:27.860
Ever since I was little,

00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:29.860
I've always loved playing soccer,

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:31.860
and that was my biggest dream.

00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:34.860
My goal was to become a professional soccer player.

00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:37.860
The truth is, setting goals was always difficult for me

00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:40.860
because I always had two passions.

00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:44.860
Am I a servant of Jehovah, or an artist?

00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:48.860
My goal was to become the best gymnast in the world.

00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:52.860
At that moment, gymnastics were number one in my life.

00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:57.969
I played at big festivals,

00:45:57.969 --> 00:45:59.969
standing ovation,

00:45:59.969 --> 00:46:02.969
that was amazing.

00:46:02.969 --> 00:46:05.969
I was surrounded by non-witnesses,

00:46:05.969 --> 00:46:09.969
using drugs, smoking, swearing.

00:46:09.969 --> 00:46:13.969
My trainer had mapped out a complete training program

00:46:13.969 --> 00:46:16.969
with the Olympics as a goal.

00:46:16.969 --> 00:46:18.969
This would make me feel trapped.

00:46:18.969 --> 00:46:20.969
I started thinking,

00:46:20.969 --> 00:46:22.969
what do I want to do with my life?

00:46:22.969 --> 00:46:25.969
More importantly, what does Jehovah want?

00:46:25.969 --> 00:46:28.969
When I was studying design, I was already a regular pioneer.

00:46:28.969 --> 00:46:31.969
It wasn't easy for me to come to the understanding

00:46:31.969 --> 00:46:34.969
that the one who really matters is Jehovah.

00:46:34.969 --> 00:46:36.969
When I was 16 years old,

00:46:36.969 --> 00:46:40.969
different teams started offering me high-paying contracts.

00:46:40.969 --> 00:46:42.969
I felt a lot of pressure,

00:46:42.969 --> 00:46:45.969
and it was a temptation because they would constantly call me

00:46:45.969 --> 00:46:48.969
and come to my house.

00:46:48.969 --> 00:46:50.969
I noticed that when the players played the sport,

00:46:50.969 --> 00:46:52.969
they were happy.

00:46:52.969 --> 00:46:54.969
But afterwards, they weren't.

00:46:54.969 --> 00:46:56.969
My mother was in the full-time service,

00:46:56.969 --> 00:46:59.969
and I saw her happiness.

00:46:59.969 --> 00:47:02.969
That motivated me because I too wanted to experience

00:47:02.969 --> 00:47:05.969
that lasting happiness.

00:47:05.969 --> 00:47:07.969
I felt a little guilty when I thought of how much of myself

00:47:07.969 --> 00:47:11.969
I was giving to design and art and all of that.

00:47:11.969 --> 00:47:13.969
So that's when I made my decision.

00:47:13.969 --> 00:47:17.969
I decided to leave university and focus on my service.

00:47:17.969 --> 00:47:19.969
I realized that for a long time,

00:47:19.969 --> 00:47:21.969
I hadn't been growing spiritually.

00:47:21.969 --> 00:47:24.969
I prayed intensely to Jehovah.

00:47:24.969 --> 00:47:29.219
I asked, do I know you?

00:47:29.219 --> 00:47:34.199
Do I live the way you would want?

00:47:34.199 --> 00:47:43.590
And after that, I stopped performing with non-witnesses.

00:47:43.590 --> 00:47:45.590
I prayed to Jehovah.

00:47:45.590 --> 00:47:47.590
And then, at the convention,

00:47:47.590 --> 00:47:49.590
we received a DVD young people asked,

00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:51.590
what will I do with my life?

00:47:51.590 --> 00:47:57.420
That really was Jehovah's answer to my prayers.

00:47:57.420 --> 00:47:59.420
In the Bible, it says,

00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:01.420
that the truth will set you free.

00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:05.420
That freedom is something I never used to feel.

00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:08.420
I love working together with other sisters in the ministry,

00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:12.420
to see how they share my enthusiasm for making return visits

00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:14.420
and conducting Bible studies.

00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:17.420
It's just wonderful to see.

00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:20.420
To wake up each day, knowing that I'm going to do something new

00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:23.420
for Jehovah is extraordinary.

00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:25.420
It's an unbelievable blessing.

00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:27.420
It's like living a dream.

00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:29.420
I feel that I belong to a global organization

00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:32.420
and we are all going in the same direction.

00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:35.420
It's something really wonderful for me.

00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:41.420
To sing for Jehovah is the most beautiful privilege I could ever imagine.

00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:46.420
One of the biggest blessings is that I have a real friendship with Jehovah.

00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:48.420
Friendship with my brothers and sisters.

00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:51.420
Young or old, it doesn't matter.

00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:55.420
I am really happy that when Jehovah looks at me,

00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:57.420
I feel his approval.

00:48:57.420 --> 00:49:00.420
That makes me happy.

00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:03.420
My trust in Jehovah has grown stronger.

00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:06.420
The way I communicate with him continues to improve.

00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:10.420
And I also love my assignment of being a regular pioneer and elder

00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:13.420
and to be able to support the brothers and sisters.

00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:16.420
To continue to be among Jehovah's people,

00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:20.420
that's the joy I was looking for and I found it.

00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:27.210
The world tries to pass off the thrill of recognition or fame as fulfillment,

00:49:27.210 --> 00:49:29.210
but do not be deceived.

00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:33.210
These fine examples show that doing your best for Jehovah

00:49:33.210 --> 00:49:36.210
leads to real contentment.

00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:43.210
His small approval is worth more than any accolade this system of things could ever bestow.

00:49:43.210 --> 00:49:49.210
Satan works tirelessly to wear us down physically and emotionally.

00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:55.210
How can we have the courage to stand up to the challenges and pressures to give up?

00:49:55.210 --> 00:49:59.210
The loving support True Christians give to one another

00:49:59.210 --> 00:50:05.210
is illustrated in this month's music video entitled Do Not Be Afraid.

00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:37.800
It's hard to see clear when challenges appear.

00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:49.239
We get lost inside the emotions we feel.

00:50:49.239 --> 00:50:59.579
When adversity strikes us down,

00:50:59.579 --> 00:51:04.579
no need to stay on the ground,

00:51:04.579 --> 00:51:09.780
reach out,

00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:22.690
saving us with his right hand of righteousness

00:51:22.690 --> 00:51:25.690
so when it gets hard,

00:51:25.690 --> 00:54:52.690
so prayers of faith just pray.

00:54:52.690 --> 00:54:57.690
The heartfelt appeal of that song brings to mind the words of Isaiah 41-10

00:54:57.690 --> 00:54:59.690
where we're encouraged,

00:54:59.690 --> 00:55:03.690
Do Not Be Afraid for I Am With You.

00:55:03.690 --> 00:55:06.690
Do Not Be Anxious for I Am Your God.

00:55:06.690 --> 00:55:08.690
I will fortify you.

00:55:08.690 --> 00:55:10.690
Yes, I will help you.

00:55:10.690 --> 00:55:15.690
I will really hold on to you with my right hand of righteousness.

00:55:15.690 --> 00:55:19.690
Be assured that you will receive help from our Heavenly Father Jehovah

00:55:19.690 --> 00:55:26.690
and from fellow believers to resist being molded by this system.

00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:29.690
To conclude, we bring you greetings from Mata-ah

00:55:29.690 --> 00:55:34.690
in the state of Amazonas and northern Brazil.

00:55:34.690 --> 00:55:38.690
Nestled in the Amazon rainforest along the Japura River,

00:55:38.690 --> 00:55:41.690
there are no roads leading to this city.

00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:44.690
It can only be reached by river.

00:55:44.690 --> 00:55:48.690
For most travelers reaching this city is a three-day journey

00:55:48.690 --> 00:55:52.690
which involves sleeping in hammocks along the way.

00:55:52.690 --> 00:55:56.690
Around 18,000 people inhabit the area

00:55:56.690 --> 00:55:58.690
but because of its remote location,

00:55:58.690 --> 00:56:03.690
many people have never had the opportunity to hear the good news.

00:56:03.690 --> 00:56:06.690
With that in mind, along with several other cities,

00:56:06.690 --> 00:56:11.690
Mata-ah was included in the Amazonas National Preaching Campaign.

00:56:11.690 --> 00:56:15.690
The goal of this special campaign was to reach the thousands of people

00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:20.690
who live in some of the Amazon's most isolated areas.

00:56:20.690 --> 00:56:24.690
As a result, many willing brothers and sisters moved here

00:56:24.690 --> 00:56:27.690
to serve where the need is greater.

00:56:27.690 --> 00:56:31.690
Since the city is completely surrounded by rivers,

00:56:31.690 --> 00:56:34.690
publishers reach interested ones by boat.

00:56:34.690 --> 00:56:39.690
Special pioneers have played a large part in cultivating interest

00:56:39.690 --> 00:56:42.690
by using this method of preaching.

00:56:42.690 --> 00:56:45.690
One of the 23 congregations that were formed

00:56:45.690 --> 00:56:50.690
as a result of the special campaign is located here.

00:56:50.690 --> 00:56:54.690
Today, more than 20 publishers in the congregation

00:56:54.690 --> 00:56:58.690
are conducting at least 100 Bible studies.

00:56:58.690 --> 00:57:02.690
And we're happy to report that in 2017,

00:57:02.690 --> 00:57:06.690
the first local family was baptized.

00:57:06.690 --> 00:57:09.690
Our dear brothers and sisters are working hard

00:57:09.690 --> 00:57:13.690
to help those in the Amazon region to learn about Jehovah.

00:57:13.690 --> 00:57:19.940
And they send their warm love and greetings to all of us around the globe.

00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:22.940
Thank you for joining us this month.

00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:25.940
As always, this is JW Broadcasting

00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:29.940
from the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses.
