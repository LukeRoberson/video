00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:20.550
When everything falls apart, and when everything around you is chaotic, the one thing you have is your relationship with Jehovah.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.550
My name is Bati Michael Dugbeck. I was born in Monrovia, Liberia, in 1980.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.549
Growing up in Monrovia before the war was an amazing time.

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:41.549
I had wonderful parents, we grew up in a nice house, and we went to a great school.

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:46.549
When I was nine years old, everything changed overnight.

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:52.549
There was reports of rebels trying to take over the government.

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:58.549
Those reports alone made people panic.

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:03.549
Businesses started to close down. Services were shut down.

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:08.549
The lights, the power, the water, everything stopped.

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:17.549
The next few years were really unstable. In 1996, things again fell apart completely.

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.549
It was all out war. This time the rebels were in the city.

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.549
There was a lot of looting going on.

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.549
There was a lot of shooting.

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.549
The rebels were known for torture. If people would not agree to fight with them.

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:45.340
In a situation like that, there's a lot of fear. There's a lot of panic.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.340
And when your fear levels rises, the best way to deal with it is prayer.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.340
Prayer to Jehovah, asking him specifically for directions on what to do next.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.340
As the fighting escalated and it got closer to where we lived, it was no longer safe.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.340
We had to flee and we ended up at the branch office.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.340
The brothers were very loving. They took really good care of us.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.340
Our spiritual activities, they made sure we kept up with that.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.960
Looking back, I'm very grateful to have survived.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.960
Two things helped us get through.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.960
Number one, our relationship with Jehovah.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.960
That's the only thing that keeps you stable.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.960
But then also we were able to survive because of the help from the brothers and sisters.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.960
Those moments of trial, that's when you really realize how much you need the brotherhood.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.960
I have a lot of joy in my assignment at Beffa with audio video services.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.960
I love the brothers and sisters that I work with.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.960
It's all thanks to Jehovah that I'm alive and I get to serve him every day.
