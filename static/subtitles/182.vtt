00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:06.879
When I say the words holy and holiness, what comes to your mind?

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:12.880
Many think of words like clean and pure, but let's change the question a little.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.880
Who comes to your mind?

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.879
Likely you think of Jehovah.

00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:21.879
You might also picture Jesus Christ and the Holy Angels.

00:00:21.879 --> 00:00:25.879
But do you think of imperfect humans?

00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:28.879
Can humans be described as holy?

00:00:28.879 --> 00:00:29.879
Yes.

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:33.880
We know this because humans were created in God's image.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.880
Just as we can reflect godly qualities such as love, kindness and self-control,

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.880
we can reflect holiness.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.880
How seriously should we take holiness?

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.880
It's no small matter.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.880
Today the world around us is increasing in badness.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:59.880
2 Timothy chapter 3 verse 13 warns that wicked men would advance from bad to worse.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.879
Undoubtedly, before the end, Satan's efforts to promote wickedness will intensify.

00:01:05.879 --> 00:01:13.879
So we must intensify our efforts to be holy and reject all badness.

00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:18.879
Who do you think are Satan's primary targets?

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:19.879
We are.

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:26.879
He and the demons are like a pack of hungry lions looking to devour us.

00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:32.879
Being a publisher of the good news is a privilege that Satan seeks to attack.

00:01:32.879 --> 00:01:35.879
Are you a parent with children?

00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:40.879
Do you think Satan wants you to become unclean?

00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:41.879
Yes.

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:47.879
He knows that devouring a family head could weaken an entire family.

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:54.879
In the congregation, Satan would love to devour you dear pioneers, ministerial servants and elders.

00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:56.879
Are you in the circuit work?

00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:57.879
A missionary?

00:01:57.879 --> 00:01:59.879
A Bethelite?

00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:01.879
What a sacred privilege.

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:06.879
But remember, it also means that we have a big target on our back.

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:12.879
Satan and the demons would love to penetrate our clean and holy position.

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:17.879
Doing so could impact the kingdom work or stumble others.

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.879
So we can't be complacent.

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:26.879
We must intensify our efforts to reject all badness.

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.879
Thus, holiness is a vital topic.

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:38.879
To that end, the theme for this month's program is perfecting holiness in God's fear.

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:43.879
It's based on 2 Corinthians chapter 7 and verse 1.

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:50.879
To begin, we need to better understand the source of holiness, Jehovah God.

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:58.879
As we read the Bible, we see that holiness is an important quality that Jehovah wants us to know about Him.

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:05.879
The Bible contains many verses that associate God's name with the words holy and holiness.

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:12.879
Please open your copy of the Bible to one example at Isaiah chapter 6.

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.879
We'll start at Isaiah chapter 6 and verse 1.

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:23.879
Now imagine that you are the prophet Isaiah who received a divine vision.

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.879
What would you have seen and heard?

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:29.879
Let's read verses 1 to 3.

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:38.879
In the year that King Isaiah died, I saw Jehovah sitting on a lofty and elevated throne.

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.879
And the skirts of his robe filled the temple.

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:46.879
Seraphs were standing above him. Each had six wings.

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:50.879
Each covered his face with two and covered his feet with two.

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:53.879
And each of them would fly about with two.

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:59.879
And one called to the other, holy, holy, holy is Jehovah of armies.

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:03.879
The whole earth is filled with his glory.

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:07.879
Isaiah was likely filled with awe.

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:14.879
Verse 2 indicates that he saw seraphs, spirit creatures, evidently a very high rank.

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.879
What do we learn from their song?

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:20.879
They're repeating the word holy three times.

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:24.879
Teachers us that Jehovah is holy to the superlative degree.

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:28.879
No one else is as holy as he is.

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:32.879
But what exactly is holiness?

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:34.879
What does it mean to be holy?

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:36.879
Let's dig deeper.

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:41.879
We can do so with a helpful tool found in the revised New World translation.

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:44.879
If you don't have the revised edition in your language,

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:47.879
we'll share the key point in just a moment.

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:54.879
In the revised printed edition, the glossary is located several pages after revelation

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:58.879
and immediately after the Bible words index.

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:01.879
The topics are arranged alphabetically.

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:05.879
So please find the entry for holy holiness.

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:12.879
If you're using JW Library, here are two ways to get to the glossary.

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:17.879
In the app, go to the Bible, then at the top of the screen,

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:23.879
tap on the magnifying glass to start a search, then type in the word holy.

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:28.879
Soon you'll see an entry from the glossary, tap on that.

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:33.879
Another way is to go to publications and then books.

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:38.879
From there you can open the glossary and find the entry for holy.

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:41.879
Ready? Let's read it.

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:46.879
A quality possessed inherently by Jehovah,

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:51.879
a state of absolute moral purity and sacredness.

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:57.879
When referring to humans, animals, things, places, time periods and activities,

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:01.879
the original Hebrew word conveys the thought of separateness,

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:05.879
exclusiveness or sanctification to the Holy God,

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:10.879
a state of being set aside for Jehovah's service.

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:15.879
In the Christian Greek scriptures, the words rendered holy and holiness,

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:18.879
likewise denote separation to God.

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:26.879
The words are also used to refer to purity in one's personal conduct.

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:29.879
What did we learn?

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:34.879
First, we're reminded that Jehovah is pure in the absolute sense.

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:39.879
But what does it mean that holiness is a quality that he possesses inherently?

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:42.879
Let's illustrate.

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:46.879
Consider the words human and imperfect.

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:49.879
Today those two words naturally go together.

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:54.879
Imperfection is within all of us and affects everything we do.

00:06:54.879 --> 00:07:00.879
Now consider another set of words that consistently go together.

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:04.879
Jehovah and Holy.

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:07.879
Holiness permeates Jehovah.

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:11.879
He doesn't have to perfect holiness like we do.

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:17.879
Everything about him is inherently clean, pure and upright.

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:22.879
What a contrast Jehovah's holiness is to the world around us.

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:29.879
Today virtually everything about human society alienated from God is polluted in some way,

00:07:29.879 --> 00:07:33.879
either by inherited imperfection or by outright wickedness.

00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:38.879
But Jehovah is completely removed from sinfulness.

00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:41.879
He'll never be polluted by badness.

00:07:41.879 --> 00:07:45.879
He'll never turn corrupt, immoral or abusive.

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:52.879
Because he's absolutely holy, he's completely reliable.

00:07:52.879 --> 00:07:57.879
This means that Jehovah is the ideal father.

00:07:57.879 --> 00:08:01.879
How encouraging and reassuring.

00:08:01.879 --> 00:08:04.879
Jehovah's holiness is beautiful.

00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:07.879
Think about the physical world.

00:08:07.879 --> 00:08:10.879
How do you feel about beautiful things?

00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:14.879
Are you drawn to them or repelled by them?

00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:18.879
For example, look at these landscapes.

00:08:18.879 --> 00:08:20.879
How do they make you feel?

00:08:20.879 --> 00:08:23.879
Would you like to spend time here?

00:08:23.879 --> 00:08:30.879
Can you see yourself walking here, filling your lungs with clean, fresh air?

00:08:30.879 --> 00:08:36.879
Or how about drinking from a river of pure crystal clear water?

00:08:36.879 --> 00:08:41.879
How we yearn to live in such conditions and we will.

00:08:41.879 --> 00:08:47.879
But have you ever wondered what it is about these images that so appealing?

00:08:47.879 --> 00:08:52.879
Simply put, everything is pure and clean.

00:08:52.879 --> 00:08:59.879
On the other hand, if these same locations were filled with garbage, graffiti and smog,

00:08:59.879 --> 00:09:03.879
would you still want to be there?

00:09:03.879 --> 00:09:05.879
Likely not.

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:08.879
Pollution and filth are not attractive.

00:09:08.879 --> 00:09:10.879
What's the point?

00:09:10.879 --> 00:09:14.879
We're naturally drawn to beauty.

00:09:14.879 --> 00:09:19.879
Beauty is associated with things that are clean, pure and bright.

00:09:19.879 --> 00:09:25.879
That's how Jehovah wants us to view his holiness.

00:09:25.879 --> 00:09:32.879
Meditating on this aspect of God's personality draws us closer to him.

00:09:32.879 --> 00:09:39.879
And though he hates all sin, his word confirms that he doesn't hate us.

00:09:39.879 --> 00:09:46.879
All of this stirs within us a desire to perfect holiness.

00:09:46.879 --> 00:09:53.879
Let's now open to 2 Corinthians, chapter 7 and verse 1, our theme scripture.

00:09:53.879 --> 00:09:59.879
Though Paul wrote this to one congregation, Jehovah preserved it for us.

00:09:59.879 --> 00:10:01.879
It says,

00:10:01.879 --> 00:10:05.879
Therefore, since we have these promises beloved ones,

00:10:05.879 --> 00:10:12.879
let us cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit,

00:10:12.879 --> 00:10:17.879
perfecting holiness in the fear of God.

00:10:17.879 --> 00:10:22.879
The concluding part of the verse serves as the basis for our theme.

00:10:22.879 --> 00:10:26.879
What does it mean to perfect something?

00:10:26.879 --> 00:10:28.879
According to one dictionary,

00:10:28.879 --> 00:10:32.879
to perfect means to bring to a state of supreme excellence,

00:10:32.879 --> 00:10:37.879
to rid of faults, to improve or refine.

00:10:37.879 --> 00:10:43.879
As an example, perhaps you enjoy a hobby like drawing, taking photographs,

00:10:43.879 --> 00:10:45.879
or playing an instrument.

00:10:45.879 --> 00:10:51.879
If an expert in that field told you that you should perfect your talent,

00:10:51.879 --> 00:10:53.879
what would he mean?

00:10:53.879 --> 00:10:58.879
First, he's confirming that you have some experience already.

00:10:58.879 --> 00:11:01.879
Second, he's telling you,

00:11:01.879 --> 00:11:05.879
you have what it takes to be even better in the future.

00:11:05.879 --> 00:11:08.879
I can see your potential.

00:11:08.879 --> 00:11:12.879
Of course, perfecting a hobby takes time.

00:11:12.879 --> 00:11:15.879
The same is true of our holiness.

00:11:15.879 --> 00:11:19.879
The book, Word Pictures in the New Testament,

00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:24.879
notes that the word perfecting at 2 Corinthians chapter 7 and verse 1

00:11:24.879 --> 00:11:28.879
means not a sudden attainment of complete holiness,

00:11:28.879 --> 00:11:32.879
but a continuous process.

00:11:32.879 --> 00:11:36.879
So Jehovah, the expert in holiness,

00:11:36.879 --> 00:11:40.879
and our best friend, is appealing to us.

00:11:40.879 --> 00:11:42.879
In effect, he's saying,

00:11:42.879 --> 00:11:45.879
I see your potential.

00:11:45.879 --> 00:11:49.879
You have what it takes to make progress in holiness.

00:11:49.879 --> 00:11:53.879
Keep working to perfect it.

00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:56.879
Does such an appeal touch your heart?

00:11:56.879 --> 00:11:58.879
We could ask ourselves,

00:11:58.879 --> 00:12:04.879
is there an area in my life where I can refine my holiness?

00:12:04.879 --> 00:12:08.879
For example, consider the matter of physical cleanness.

00:12:09.879 --> 00:12:11.879
Chapter 8 of the book,

00:12:11.879 --> 00:12:13.879
How to Remain in God's Love

00:12:13.879 --> 00:12:18.879
Discusses the need to glorify Jehovah by keeping our body and clothing,

00:12:18.879 --> 00:12:20.879
our home and surroundings,

00:12:20.879 --> 00:12:23.879
and our place of worship clean.

00:12:23.879 --> 00:12:26.879
Being physically clean benefits us,

00:12:26.879 --> 00:12:28.879
and those around us.

00:12:28.879 --> 00:12:32.879
More important, it honors our Holy Father.

00:12:32.879 --> 00:12:37.879
But our personal cleaning program must go below the surface.

00:12:38.879 --> 00:12:40.879
In our theme text,

00:12:40.879 --> 00:12:42.879
Jehovah urges us to cleanse ourselves

00:12:42.879 --> 00:12:45.879
of every defilement of flesh and spirit.

00:12:45.879 --> 00:12:49.879
This involves every aspect of our lives.

00:12:49.879 --> 00:12:52.879
For example, something we read in the Bible

00:12:52.879 --> 00:12:54.879
or that we hear at a meeting

00:12:54.879 --> 00:12:58.879
may warn us that our thoughts need further refinement.

00:12:58.879 --> 00:13:02.879
Perhaps we detect a tendency toward materialism,

00:13:02.879 --> 00:13:07.879
or we realize that our precious time is being consumed by social media,

00:13:07.879 --> 00:13:11.879
surfing the internet, or playing video games.

00:13:11.879 --> 00:13:14.879
In Ephesians 4, 23 and 24,

00:13:14.879 --> 00:13:17.879
we're urged to continue to be made new

00:13:17.879 --> 00:13:20.879
in our dominant mental attitude

00:13:20.879 --> 00:13:23.879
and to put on the new personality.

00:13:23.879 --> 00:13:27.879
So our challenge might be a deeply ingrained,

00:13:27.879 --> 00:13:30.879
negative personality trait.

00:13:30.879 --> 00:13:33.879
A sister named Christina admitted,

00:13:33.879 --> 00:13:37.879
I often find myself looking envyously at others.

00:13:37.879 --> 00:13:42.879
I compare what they have with what I don't have.

00:13:42.879 --> 00:13:45.879
Well, these are just a few examples.

00:13:45.879 --> 00:13:49.879
And these may not be our weaknesses,

00:13:49.879 --> 00:13:51.879
but the lesson is clear.

00:13:51.879 --> 00:13:55.879
All of us need to keep examining ourselves.

00:13:55.879 --> 00:13:57.879
And brothers and sisters,

00:13:57.879 --> 00:14:00.879
when we identify a personal weakness,

00:14:00.879 --> 00:14:03.879
what should we do?

00:14:03.879 --> 00:14:05.879
For illustration purposes,

00:14:05.879 --> 00:14:10.879
let's use the example of Christina and her battle with envy.

00:14:10.879 --> 00:14:16.879
A three-step program to change our dominant mental attitude

00:14:16.879 --> 00:14:22.879
was published on page 11 of the June 2019 study edition of The Watchtower.

00:14:22.879 --> 00:14:26.879
What's the first thing Christina should do?

00:14:26.879 --> 00:14:30.879
Step 1. She needs to talk to Jehovah,

00:14:30.879 --> 00:14:34.879
admitting that she recognizes the need to change.

00:14:34.879 --> 00:14:39.879
If she prays regularly for Jehovah to put within her a new spirit,

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:42.879
our Holy God will help her.

00:14:42.879 --> 00:14:46.879
Step 2. She needs to meditate,

00:14:46.879 --> 00:14:50.879
so as to examine herself in the mirror of God's Word.

00:14:50.879 --> 00:14:53.879
For example, she might think deeply about the fact

00:14:53.879 --> 00:14:59.879
that love is not jealous and does not look for its own interests.

00:14:59.879 --> 00:15:03.879
This would help Christina to hate envy.

00:15:03.879 --> 00:15:08.879
Step 3. She needs to assess her relationships

00:15:08.879 --> 00:15:11.879
and choose good association.

00:15:11.879 --> 00:15:15.879
Could it be that negative gossip either in person

00:15:15.879 --> 00:15:19.879
or online is shaping her thinking?

00:15:19.879 --> 00:15:23.879
If so, she'd be wise to choose better association.

00:15:23.879 --> 00:15:28.879
Yes, Jehovah's blessing upon Christina's personal efforts

00:15:28.879 --> 00:15:32.879
will enable her to perfect holiness.

00:15:32.879 --> 00:15:38.879
These three steps can help us do the same.

00:15:38.879 --> 00:15:41.879
Let's now review our key points.

00:15:41.879 --> 00:15:46.879
First, wickedness is going from bad to worse,

00:15:46.879 --> 00:15:51.879
so we need to intensify our efforts to be holy.

00:15:51.879 --> 00:15:56.879
Second, since Jehovah is the source of holiness,

00:15:56.879 --> 00:16:00.879
everything about him is clean, pure, and upright.

00:16:00.879 --> 00:16:07.879
This beautiful quality draws us to him and moves us to be holy.

00:16:07.879 --> 00:16:12.879
Third and most important, Jehovah appeals to us

00:16:12.879 --> 00:16:18.879
to cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit.

00:16:18.879 --> 00:16:21.879
So may we accept Jehovah's help

00:16:21.879 --> 00:16:26.879
and work to perfect holiness in God's fear.
