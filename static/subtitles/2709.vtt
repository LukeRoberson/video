00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:11.289
The Bible describes God as the hero of prayer.

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:18.390
He can even hear your silent prayers.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.390
How is that possible?

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.390
The hero of prayer is also the creator of all life.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.390
He understands how the human mind works.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.390
He designed it so he can read the thoughts of your mind

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.390
and hear your silent prayers.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.079
Jehovah God is interested in you.

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.079
No matter where you live.

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:57.159
Whenever language you speak, he understands it.

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:09.219
But does he accept and listen to all prayers?

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:13.219
Imagine a manager who sees an employee stealing.

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:17.719
The manager confronts him.

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:20.719
But the employee first lies about his stealing

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:24.719
and then tries to justify his actions.

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:28.719
Although the manager hears the employee's lies and excuses,

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:31.719
he refuses to accept them.

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:36.719
Similarly, God does not accept all prayers.

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:41.719
For example, what if a person's prayer is selfish?

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:47.730
What if a man mistreats his wife at home

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.730
and the next day he asks for God's blessings?

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:58.030
What if soldiers pray to God for help to destroy their enemy

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.030
while the opposing army prays for the same thing?

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.030
Will God accept such prayers?

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.030
Clearly, God is not pleased with prayers

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.030
that conflict with his moral principles.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.030
On the other hand, God eagerly accepts your prayers.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.030
Even if you have done bad things,

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.030
if you sincerely want to draw close to him

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.030
and seek his wisdom and forgiveness,

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.909
being heard by God is indeed possible

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.909
for those who strive to please him.
