00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.679
Karen, you've always been known for your warm, infectious smile.

00:00:05.679 --> 00:00:11.439
Could you tell us what has helped you to cope with a serious health challenge and yet still

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:14.279
maintain such a positive attitude?

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:19.280
Surprisingly, I have never cried because of having LS.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.640
I only break down out of frustration when I can't communicate.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.960
When I was first diagnosed, I figured it was time to copy my study Bible and other

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.079
notes I had been saving and put them in electronic format.

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.079
I wrote so small, no one could read them.

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.000
It took a year, but reading the Bible and notes spilled me up.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
All the prayers said for us certainly help, the boxes of cards with encouraging words

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.439
and scripture.

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:59.960
We have never been without flowers which cheer us up and being surrounded by love.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.240
I think we all feel that way.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.879
There's no other organization that would take care of us, same like Jova's organization

00:01:06.879 --> 00:01:08.280
and his people.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.400
But Karen, can you tell us a little bit about this device that you're using to communicate?

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.750
How exactly does it work?

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.950
This computer is a life saver because it enables me to talk.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.549
You know how much I like to talk.

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:31.510
It is called an eye gaze because I calibrate this to my eyes and then stare at a keyboard

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.310
on the screen and I can type words.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.909
It also suggests words like on your phone, so I don't have to type everything out.

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.269
I can save responses that I want to use again.

00:01:46.269 --> 00:01:49.469
You might wonder how it can sound like me.

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:56.230
I didn't save my voice in time, so my sister recorded 50 sentences that have all the

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.150
sounds needed for English.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.230
Since we are twins, we sound the same.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.349
Wow, that's amazing.

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:09.750
What a blessing to be able to have even your sister help you out with it as well.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.789
So Reiner, how are you able to obtain this device?

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:22.590
When you have ALS or Lugerix as it is called also, then the state of New York pays for

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.310
all the equipment.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.909
This device with the insurance and all the attachments goes for up to about $18,000.

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:35.870
So it's amazing what this government does for us.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.069
What a blessing from Jehovah.

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.349
So Karen, how has this helped you to maintain a regular study of the Bible and even helped

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.030
you with your participation at the meetings?

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.509
I can type comments for meetings ahead of time.

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:56.710
And I can study on JW Library and access JW dot org.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.830
It is much slower, but at least I can study and participate.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.849
Oh, that's wonderful.

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:10.289
Reiner, can you tell us how do the friends in the curingation react when they hear Karen

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:12.409
comment at the meetings?

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:18.530
The congregation is very appreciative and they're really encouraged by that because just

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.009
about every meeting, Karen has a comment.

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:29.889
And after she gives a comment, they say, all we're glad it was Karen and not you, Reiner.

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:34.050
So they're very happy to hear Karen and see her.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.050
Very good.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.210
These last couple questions are for both of you.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.449
Maybe we could start with you, Reiner.

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:45.129
How have you received strength and support, particularly from your brothers and sisters

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:46.889
during this trial?

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:50.569
Do you have any specific examples that you can share with us?

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:56.330
Yes, the brothers here in the infirmary are just outstanding.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:02.330
And I think this would be the first time I would get through an interview without getting

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.330
emotional.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.650
Sorry about that.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.009
They are so nice and so helpful.

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:16.529
They come in the morning at 8.30, they ask if Karen is up already, can she get up?

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:22.689
When they get up and they get ready for a breakfast and sometimes that goes till 11,

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:26.089
11, 30 before she can have breakfast.

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:33.050
So this is a lot of work and they do it such a beautiful job.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.050
Remarkable.

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.050
Absolutely.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.290
I'm sure they appreciate your expressions as well.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.290
What about you, Karen?

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.290
How have you appreciated the support from the brothers and sisters?

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.930
Besides what I mentioned, our congregation heard about me.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.689
They wanted to learn how to make my cookies.

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:58.250
So they took my recipes and created a gorgeous cookbook and gave us copies to share.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.970
Then they arranged baking classes via Zoom.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.410
It means so much to me that a part of me will continue.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.410
It was a real witness to our unbelieving relatives too.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.410
Wow.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.410
So here's the cookbook.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.810
It's not where they come from.

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:16.810
This way.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:17.810
That's beautiful.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:18.810
Look at that.

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.930
Cookies don't even know about it.

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:29.209
The sister composed it and it was beautiful display and the example said, it's outstanding.

00:05:29.209 --> 00:05:30.209
Wow.

00:05:30.209 --> 00:05:35.170
That's beautiful to see how everyone's rallied around both of you to support.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:40.769
So the last question, how have you seen Jehovah's hand in your lives as you face this challenge?

00:05:40.769 --> 00:05:42.769
Maybe you could start with you, Rhine, please?

00:05:42.769 --> 00:05:49.170
Yes, of course this is a very difficult situation because when you're paralyzed, it's

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:50.170
bad.

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:58.889
But if you're paralyzed and you're not able to speak, that makes a very difficult situation.

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:03.209
But the help of the brothers has been outstanding.

00:06:03.209 --> 00:06:06.250
The love is remarkable.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:07.250
Absolutely.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.769
Thank you for sharing.

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:13.480
What about you, Karen?

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:20.399
We appreciate now why the infirmary is always mentioned in the letters to the Bethel family.

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:26.560
The ones who take care of us cannot be compared to others in the same profession.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.519
They work with heart.

00:06:28.519 --> 00:06:33.079
It isn't just a job to them, but they work with love.

00:06:33.079 --> 00:06:38.360
My aunt was on Zoom when a PCA kissed me on the forehead as she left.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.319
My aunt said, with tears in her eyes, they love her.
