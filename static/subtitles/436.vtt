00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:09.250
Have you ever been misjudged when Brother Parkin was serving in Puerto Rico, it happened

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:10.769
to him.

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.830
Brother North came down from Brooklyn for the very first international convention on the

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:15.830
island.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.670
It was an exciting time for everyone, and Brother Parkin did his best to get everything

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.670
well organized.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.969
But after the missionary meeting, Brother North assumed that transportation had not been

00:00:27.969 --> 00:00:33.810
arranged for everyone to get back to the hotel, although, in fact, it had.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:40.090
And later, he gave Brother Parkin some strong counsel about being better organized.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.130
He even said that he was disappointed in him.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.210
Well, Brother Parkin thought that said, I'm out of here, and he even told his wife later

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.729
to start packing.

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:57.170
But at the time, he says he didn't argue with Brother North or try to justify himself.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.890
He admits that he did feel misjudged and was upset afterwards for quite a while.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.129
Has something like that ever happened to you?

00:01:07.129 --> 00:01:08.129
Likely it has.

00:01:08.129 --> 00:01:11.849
It usually happens to all of us at some time.

00:01:11.849 --> 00:01:18.049
When others misjudges, we might initially get upset, feel betrayed, or become discouraged

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:19.650
for a while.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.370
We might worry that others don't see us as smart enough, strong enough, spiritual enough.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.930
And what they said may threaten our whole identity.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.849
So when something like that happens, what will help us to stay loyal to Jehovah?

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:40.450
Open your Bibles with me to Psalm 37.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:47.969
The writer here is King David, and he well knew what it was like to be upset by injustice.

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:53.650
But more important, what he wrote is inspired of God, so we can trust it.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.569
It can help us.

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:59.530
Let's start reading with verse three.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.530
He says, trust in Jehovah and do what is good.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.569
Reside in the earth and act with faithfulness.

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.330
When someone misunderstands us, our first instinct may be to prove ourselves right, but usually

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.610
that isn't very helpful.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.969
David says we should focus on Jehovah and keep doing good.

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:26.610
Be faithful, be humble, continue caring for your assignments.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.689
Jesus once said that wisdom is proved righteous by its works.

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:38.210
And many times it's our works over time, instead of trying to straighten the other person

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:44.530
out, that wins back their heart and our reputation.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.449
Why can we trust Jehovah to help us in these situations?

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:51.810
Well, remember what happened to him in the Garden of Eden.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:58.370
Jehovah based everything in creation, his entire sovereignty on love.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.729
After he made Jesus, they made everything else together.

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:10.289
As each new angel and human was created, Jesus saw just how Jehovah treated them.

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:13.689
And that made him love Jehovah even more.

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:17.210
But then, as we know, Satan slandered Jehovah.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.770
He didn't challenge his position or power.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.610
He challenged his motives, God's love.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.889
Now, can you imagine how hurtful that was to Jehovah in Jesus?

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.530
And this raised all sorts of questions.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.210
How many others would believe Satan's accusations?

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.770
What would happen to Adam's offspring?

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.610
How would Jehovah's reputation be cleared and so on?

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.129
Now Jehovah is the Almighty, and he took immediate steps to resolve those issues, but it has

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:54.250
taken a lot of time to resolve them.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:01.330
So if someone misjudges us, do you think Jehovah knows what we're going through?

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.090
He sure does.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.650
He knows exactly what it feels like.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:12.770
And as David says later in verse 18 in this Psalm, Jehovah is aware of what the blameless

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:13.770
go through.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.370
Let's read verse 4.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:25.689
This is find exquisite delight in Jehovah, and he will grant you the desires of your heart.

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:30.649
David's urging us here to find safety in Jehovah.

00:04:30.649 --> 00:04:36.490
Because when we feel safe, it's easier for us to hear what others are saying to us.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.569
We're less inclined to push our own views or justify ourselves.

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:48.769
In other Psalms, David talks about how Jehovah brought him into a place of safety.

00:04:48.769 --> 00:04:52.689
And really, who makes this feel safer than Jehovah does?

00:04:52.689 --> 00:05:00.449
If we are in Jehovah's place of safety, then we can hear almost anything without becoming

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:02.490
defensive.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.889
Verse 5.

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:11.490
Commit your way to Jehovah, David says, rely on him, and he will act in your behalf.

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.009
In other words, let Jehovah lead you.

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:20.769
Once we fully commit ourselves to Jehovah, we won't feel lost or abandoned when we have

00:05:20.769 --> 00:05:22.810
setbacks in life.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:28.490
We know that he'll continue to guide and bless us just as he did Joseph and Hannah and David

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.290
and others.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:37.209
Verses 23 and 24 of this Psalm say, Jehovah guides the steps of a man when he finds pleasure

00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:38.930
in his way.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:46.490
Although he may fall, he will not be hurled down for Jehovah supports him by the hand.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.730
Per six.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:56.410
He will make your righteousness shine like daybreak and your justice like the midday sun.

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:03.050
So Jehovah will either vindicate you or at the very least reassure you of his love.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:09.689
He knows our motives and intentions, so if a relative or friend or an overseer misjudges

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:13.769
us, Jehovah will make his own decision.

00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:19.290
The watchtower once said, if Jehovah wants to vindicate us in some matter, he can do so

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.810
at the proper time.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.490
And if he chooses to do that, it will be obvious.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:32.050
One translation puts this verse, it will become as clear as the noon day sun that you

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.490
were right.

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.889
But not all situations get resolved in that way, do they?

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:42.370
We love to hear those stories about Joseph and Hannah and David where the underdog ends

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.290
up on top.

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:50.250
But what about Mephibbusheth, Jeremiah or the Apostle Paul?

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.930
Were their reputations ever completely clear during their lifetime?

00:06:54.930 --> 00:07:01.490
So it makes no sense to hold on to hurt feelings until Jehovah vindicates us.

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.370
It's so much better to resolve the matter now.

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:12.089
Notice verse 7, keep silent before Jehovah and wait expectantly for him, do not be upset

00:07:12.089 --> 00:07:16.129
by the man who succeeds in carrying out his schemes.

00:07:16.129 --> 00:07:21.649
The bottom line is we can't stay upset.

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:27.529
What though if we get counsel that doesn't seem to be 100% correct like in Brother

00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:30.050
Parkinson's case?

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:34.850
Of course if you're accused of something serious, you should speak up at least to satisfy

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:36.769
your conscience.

00:07:36.769 --> 00:07:44.329
But more often, after you pray about it and think about what was said, why not just

00:07:44.329 --> 00:07:47.410
apply what you can?

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:51.569
Most counsel has at least something that we can benefit from.

00:07:51.569 --> 00:07:57.290
And if there's something that still doesn't seem to fit, then wait patiently as the foot

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:04.649
note on verse 7 says, for Jehovah to clarify matters, or make things right.

00:08:04.649 --> 00:08:09.810
In most cases, the only way for misunderstandings to get cleared up is with the passing of

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:10.810
time.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.009
I like this quote from a brother years ago.

00:08:13.009 --> 00:08:18.769
He said, if God has been willing to wait 6,000 years for his true character to be made

00:08:18.769 --> 00:08:24.850
manifest, shouldn't we be able to wait a few brief years to have our motives and lives

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:31.050
now so sadly misunderstood, cleared of every misconception?

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:32.769
That's the key, isn't it?

00:08:32.769 --> 00:08:38.409
Focus on Jehovah, and we can be happy even when we're misunderstood.

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:44.929
Always remember that he knows exactly how you feel, and in due time, he will act in

00:08:44.929 --> 00:08:47.330
your behalf.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.529
How did things turn out for Brother Parkinson and Brother Nor?

00:08:50.529 --> 00:08:55.889
Well in his life story, Brother Parkinson says, the next time Maxine and I saw him about

00:08:55.889 --> 00:09:01.009
6 months later, he invited us to his room and cooked the meal for us.

00:09:01.009 --> 00:09:05.769
Well, it looks like Jehovah gave Brother Parkinson the requests of his heart, right?

00:09:05.769 --> 00:09:11.009
In fact, he told me recently that he and Brother Nor became the best of friends.
