00:00:02.509 --> 00:00:05.509
You're about to meet the gonoes.

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:08.509
They have served in Bethel for 44 years,

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:11.509
and Brother Gono has served as the coordinator

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:15.509
of the Netherlands branch committee since 1990.

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.510
But looking back on their long service for Jehovah,

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.510
they set priorities early on that changed the rest of their lives.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:32.789
I was raised in the truth.

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:35.789
I was baptized when I was about 11 years old,

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:38.789
together with my father.

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:40.789
And we had a very teocratic household.

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:43.789
My parents were very jealous in field service

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:45.789
and they attended all the meetings.

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:48.789
So we had a very good teocratic family,

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:51.789
a very warm nest in which we grew up.

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:55.789
At the age of 20, I was called up for the military service.

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.789
I refused, so I had to go to prison.

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.789
And I still remember when I came in the south

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.790
and when I heard that heavy door close behind me.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.790
And then the key turned a few times in the lock.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:13.790
It stood there alone.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.790
And in this first day, when I was there,

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.790
I was wondering for myself,

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.790
why am I here?

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.790
Am I just here to do what any other witness is doing?

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.790
Or is it my personal decision, my personal,

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.790
on the basis of my personal belief?

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.790
And I was really confronted with myself.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.099
For the first time in my life,

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:41.099
conscientiously, I had the feeling

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:44.099
that I was doing something for Jehovah.

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:46.099
And that has strengthened my faith.

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:50.480
It was a turn point in my life.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.480
We became engaged when Willy was in prison.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.480
And because at that time,

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.480
the watchtower publications were banned in prison.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.480
So I made hundred copies of the watchtower

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.480
and I sent them to him.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.480
I sent her love letters

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.479
and she sent me copies of the watchtower.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:19.750
When I was released from prison about two years later,

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.750
we married and then I could find a very well-paid job.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.750
And we had a beautiful house.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.750
We had a nice car or so.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.750
And it was my wish that Frida would not have to work secularly.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.750
And that was what was our aim.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.750
The future was ours.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.750
Shortly after our marriage,

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.750
we invited the circuit over here

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.750
to have dinner with us.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.750
And during the meal,

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.750
he looked at us and he said,

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.750
you have to tell me something.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.750
Why are you not pioneering?

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.750
That was a straight forward question.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.750
We couldn't answer.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.750
We didn't think about pioneering.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.750
I really don't know why we were not pioneering.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.750
As a young girl,

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.750
I always wanted to pioneer,

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.610
even become a missionary.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.610
I wanted to pioneer then,

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.610
but I couldn't.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:17.610
And now I could.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.610
And I didn't do it.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.330
At that time,

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.330
we were thinking that we already did what was right.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.330
Besides being very jealous in the truth,

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.330
I tried to take care of my lovely wife as good as I could.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.330
But was it really the best way to take care of her?

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:39.330
That same evening,

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.330
we prayed to Jehovah

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.330
and we promised him

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.330
that we would fully rely on him

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.330
according to Matthew 633.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.330
And that's what we did.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.580
That same week,

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.580
I resigned my job

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.580
and we cancelled the rent of our house.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.580
And shortly thereafter,

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.580
we moved to a small apartment

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.580
and then we started a new life,

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:02.580
pioneering.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.580
Of course, we made some sacrifices.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.580
Our previous house had everything.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.580
Now, a new apartment,

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.580
then we did not even have a shower.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.579
But we knew that we have made the right choice.

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.579
Because from then on,

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:26.139
Jehovah was really providing for everything.

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.139
We enjoyed very much serving Jehovah together.

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:30.139
Four months later,

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.139
we were appointed as special pioneers.

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:33.139
And after that,

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.139
many other privileges followed.

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.139
We had the privilege to attend Gilead School.

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:41.139
He was invited without me,

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:42.139
of course,

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.139
and that was a sacrifice.

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:45.139
But later,

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.139
I had the privilege to join Welly

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:52.139
when he was visiting different branches over the world.

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.389
That was really a blessing.

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:58.389
Full-time service has given us

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:01.389
really a meaningful life.

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:03.389
It is a pleasure to realize

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:05.389
that we use our strength

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:08.389
to seek God's kingdom first.

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:10.389
We are so happy that someone helped us

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:12.389
to make the right choices

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:14.389
right after our marriage.

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:16.389
Jehovah has blessed us all the way.

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:19.389
Looking back on these 47 years of full-time service,

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:23.389
we feel that we have had a very rich spiritual life.

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:25.389
We are so happy that we invited a circuit

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:27.389
over here for dinner that day.
