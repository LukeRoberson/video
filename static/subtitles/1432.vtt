00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:08.980
I work as a legal secretary. I was quite happy with the work I was doing, but I was just

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.779
coasting along and I didn't really have that burning desire at the time to pioneer.

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:19.260
I specifically remember a talk about young ones, what they were doing with their lives and

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.620
it really did make me think. I work three days a week as a Lanny. It's a good job for me.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.940
It helps me to do something that I love but also have the freedom to do things for

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.219
me. I really love construction, particularly what to get involved with the project going

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:39.579
on at Chamsford. But at the time I lived in the northeast of England, which would have

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:46.219
been way too far to commute. My work consists of supporting people in the community with

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:52.780
mental health issues. My husband was involved in construction, that was his work, but also he

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.700
made himself available to be involved in any King the Hall build, any construction. So beginning

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.219
with I thought, yeah, that's his thing, not my thing, I'll stay home and pioneer. My construction

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:11.099
skill would be nonexistent. The talk just helped me to see that if I didn't have a desire to

00:01:11.099 --> 00:01:17.739
pioneer, then I should pray. I really felt motivated to want to change my life. So started regular

00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:23.420
pioneering. Seeing young sisters and brothers as well, that were getting involved with doing different

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.019
aspects of worship and to see their joy in what they were doing construction wise really spurred

00:01:29.019 --> 00:01:36.859
me on to want to apply as well. I prayed to Jehovah that I really wanted to be involved somehow

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:42.299
in the project that he would work things out. I started looking for accommodation, started looking

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.859
for work and within days I had a job and somewhere to live and two weeks later I moved to London.

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:57.739
I knew my husband loved it so much so I thought I'll come with him losing my husband in death.

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:03.420
It's just something that happened very suddenly and very quickly.

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:12.379
Well initially I had to go back home and the avenue was open for me to come back again if I wish

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:18.460
to. After a period of time I decided I would come back. Brothers were very conscious of my

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:25.020
circumstance. This is my family. This is Jehovah's organisation without a doubt. The brothers would

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:34.620
give me all the support I need. It's always best to be busy in Jehovah's work. That's part of a healing.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.819
When I came on site and the brothers said we'd like you to drive one of our machines.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:49.419
I never driven construction machinery before because I was able to be trained and feel confidence

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:56.379
after that. I was invited to work on home cleaning team. It's not what I thought I would be doing

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:01.740
on construction but it's fun and I really love knowing that Jehovah's happy with the work we do.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.860
Very quickly after I moved I was invited to commute to the Bratchery location project.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.780
The first half of my week is working with children playing with toy trucks and then the second

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:21.340
half of my week I'm driving this huge machine on a building side. There's a really good emphasis

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.500
on training so you never feel completely out of your depth. I really enjoy training. It's a very

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.180
rewarding assignment. Sisters they pay attention to detail. They don't get overconfidence because

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.699
they have a healthy respect for the machines that they're driving. We've had many positive comments

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:45.180
from contractors and various authorities about the proactive training and use of women

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.379
on our construction site. They're amazed at what they see because it's not normal in the industry.

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:55.340
It reminds me of what it says in Romans chapter 16 where the Apostle Paul mentions women by name

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.060
as working hard in the Lord and here on this site we have lots of women doing just that.

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:04.379
Having no construction skills hasn't stopped me being used at all.

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:11.280
He's seen sisters being used for things that they would never have pictured themselves doing

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.439
but they're doing it and it's because they've been trained and it's because Jehovah's behind it.

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:21.920
Yeah, being here has drawn me closest Jehovah in a sense that you rely on him.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.920
That I rely on him daily. If you'd have told me three years ago that I'd be commuting to the project

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.680
every week driving a massive truck around on site I probably wouldn't have believed you.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.040
I absolutely love coming here. It's like a dream come true but I just don't want it to end.

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:46.480
Looking back at you when I first heard that talk at the convention I'm really pleased that

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:53.279
I used my time in these last days to serve Jehovah. I would encourage anybody just to be in full

00:04:53.279 --> 00:05:02.399
time service because it's such a joyful way of life.
