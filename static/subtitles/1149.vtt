00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:06.469
Ravens brought Elijah bread and meat morning and evening.

00:00:06.469 --> 00:00:13.029
Jesus transformed a hundred gallons of water into a very fine wine.

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:19.789
A hundred and twenty Christians suddenly could speak different languages.

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.589
What do those three events have in common?

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:27.510
They were all three miracles produced by Holy Spirit.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.589
But miracles are no longer happening today, is that right?

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:33.649
Not really if you think about it.

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:39.649
If we think about it, the peace, the love, the harmony of Jehovah's people in a world

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.530
that is so divided is a modern day miracle.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:51.250
In contrast, Satan's world around us is becoming more divided by race, ethnicity, religion,

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.049
political affiliation, and so forth.

00:00:54.049 --> 00:01:01.130
But Jehovah's people, more united than ever, and when we attend our assemblies and conventions,

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.109
we especially see this.

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:12.109
We see different races and nationalities enjoying a genuinely peaceful, joyful gathering.

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:17.069
In fact, looking at a world map, Sister Let and I are able to calculate that during the

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:23.430
past twenty years, we've attended assemblies, conventions, large gatherings, and at least

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:32.430
eighty-two different countries, and every one of them over a flood with love and joy.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:39.189
And every one of them convinced us even more that these are Jehovah's people.

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:45.030
People he's gathered from all nations, tribes, peoples, and tongues into his organization

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.150
and is preparing for the new world.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.230
But now we ask, what makes this modern day miracle possible?

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:59.790
To answer, it stems from a peaceful relationship that we have with our father, Jehovah, who

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.349
is called in 1 Thessalonians 523, the God of Peace.

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:10.909
As his children, we strive to imitate him, and we're all brothers and sisters, we have

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:17.150
the same father, so we are ones who show peace and love like our father.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.210
But here's another question, is maintaining this peace and harmony automatic?

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.250
All is maintaining a garden, an automobile, our health, automatic.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.689
No, it takes effort, doesn't it?

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:36.129
We're all imperfect, so we have to work at maintaining peace every day.

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.009
That's the thought, if you go to 1 Peter 3, please.

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:42.370
It does take effort.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:51.330
1 Peter 3, verse 10, for whoever would love life and see good days must guard his tongue

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:58.889
from bad and his lips from speaking deception, let him turn away from what is bad and do

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:00.650
what is good.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:07.009
Now notice, let him seek peace and pursue it.

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:13.330
So notice, effort to turn from bad, do good, seek peace and pursue it.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.330
Two action verbs.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.969
If you want to illustrate that, think of a policeman seeking pursuing a criminal.

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:22.889
The criminal is trying to get away, isn't it?

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:28.650
Well, peace tries to get away from us because of imperfection, but we have to pursue it.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.289
Interestingly, the Bible links peace to happiness.

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:44.090
Proverbs 1220, the theme scripture for this talk says, those who promote peace have joy.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:50.930
Matthew 5.9, happy are the peace makers, since they will be called sons of God.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.610
Now, it didn't say happy are the peaceful.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:59.330
See, that's just tranquil, passive, even a dead body is peaceful.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:06.129
No happy are the peace makers, a peacemaker actively promotes peace.

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.289
He makes peace where it previously was lacking.

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:13.530
If you think about cows, they make milk.

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:19.329
Bees make honey, a cheese maker makes cheese, a peacemaker makes peace.

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:24.810
Peace has been lost, it's been disturbed, but he has skill in restoring it, and of course,

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.970
a peacemaker avoids doing anything that would disturb the peace in the first place.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:38.449
He works very hard to create an environment where peace can prevail.

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:46.170
But now that leads us into the discussion about how peacemakers avoid the two peace destroyers,

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.089
jealousy and contentiousness.

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:56.290
Now, these two peace-disturbers are identified at James chapter 3.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:57.769
Let's go there, please.

00:04:57.769 --> 00:05:05.779
James chapter 3, and let's read together verses 14 and 15.

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:11.779
But if you have bitter jealousy and contentiousness in your hearts,

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:15.540
do not be bragging and lying against the truth.

00:05:15.579 --> 00:05:19.939
This is not the wisdom that comes down from above.

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:24.259
It is earthly, animalistic, demonic.

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:27.740
You know, as first, jealousy is identified.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.379
What is jealousy?

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:36.139
It means to resent someone because of his possessions, talents, or position.

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:43.259
Rather than be happy for him, we resent him, maybe even dislike him for what he has.

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:45.699
Usually things that we don't have.

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:53.060
But what makes this very serious is that jealousy can escalate to being envy.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.860
Now, what is envy, and what's the difference between envy and jealousy?

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.819
One biblical reference works as this.

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:07.139
Jealousy refers to the desire to be as well off as another.

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:15.180
But envy refers to the desire to deprive another of what he has.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.300
So the envious person, not only begrudges what someone has,

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.180
he actually wants to take it away from him.

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.420
That second peace destroyer, contentiousness.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.060
What does that mean?

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:32.779
Being disagreeable, argumentative, competitive, terrible quality.

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:35.740
It's the product of pride and selfish ambition.

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:39.139
And as we read earlier, in James 3, 14, and 15,

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:42.699
it's certainly not part of that wisdom that comes down from above.

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:49.980
But rather, it is earthly, characteristic of earthly humans who are alienated from God.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:55.980
It is animalistic, characteristic of animals who lack spirituality

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.819
and are often contentious with each other.

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:03.660
It is even demonic, characteristic of the wicked spirits

00:07:03.699 --> 00:07:06.939
who are very proud and ambitious.

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:14.019
But genuine peacemakers work very hard to avoid these two peace-disturbers,

00:07:14.019 --> 00:07:16.860
jealousy and contentiousness.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:21.620
They neither flop their talents nor do they feel threatened

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:27.339
if others are more skilled preachers, teachers, organizers or shepherds.

00:07:27.339 --> 00:07:30.699
They're very happy to be considered a lesser one,

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:35.060
as Jesus encouraged at Luke 9.48.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:39.740
Now it's true, a peacemaker made his art certain privileges of service,

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.100
but he is not consumed with ambition.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.899
See, he's balanced in his approach.

00:07:44.899 --> 00:07:47.939
As it says at 1 Timothy 3-1,

00:07:47.939 --> 00:07:52.540
if a man is reaching out to be an overseer,

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.379
he is deserous of a fine work.

00:07:55.379 --> 00:08:00.420
But it didn't say he should ambitiously grab to be an overseer.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.060
See, he's balanced.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.379
We could illustrate this by reaching out

00:08:04.379 --> 00:08:07.540
for a nice tasty piece of fruit on a tree

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:13.899
and then think of a small boy very aggressively grabbing for a toy,

00:08:13.899 --> 00:08:16.500
perhaps to try to take it away from another boy.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.740
There's a real difference, isn't there?

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:22.379
But now how does a peacemaker reach out

00:08:22.379 --> 00:08:25.540
to qualify for privileges of service?

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:29.019
Well, he just works hard to develop Christian qualities

00:08:29.019 --> 00:08:32.460
within himself, and he just works hard

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:34.059
in behalf of King Dementres.

00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:38.019
And he's guided by Galatians 6 verse 4,

00:08:38.019 --> 00:08:40.940
where it says he will have cause for rejoicing

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:47.940
in regard to himself alone and not in comparison with the other person.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:52.539
Additionally, a real peacemaker humbly waits on Jehovah

00:08:52.539 --> 00:08:57.340
to determine when he's qualified to receive a certain privilege.

00:08:57.379 --> 00:08:59.419
And Jehovah knows, doesn't he?

00:08:59.419 --> 00:09:02.139
I love the account about Moses,

00:09:02.139 --> 00:09:04.620
how when he was 40 years old,

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.779
he really thought he was qualified ready

00:09:07.779 --> 00:09:11.179
to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.

00:09:11.179 --> 00:09:13.659
But Jehovah knew he wasn't ready yet.

00:09:13.659 --> 00:09:18.899
But now after tending flocks for 40 years in mid-end

00:09:18.899 --> 00:09:21.340
when he was now 80 years old,

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:23.820
Jehovah knew now he was ready.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.860
Interestingly, at this point, Moses thought he wasn't ready.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:31.139
But Jehovah assured him that he was.

00:09:31.139 --> 00:09:35.179
And when a peacemaker does receive a privilege of service,

00:09:35.179 --> 00:09:38.940
he credits receiving it to Jehovah

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.580
and not as a personal achievement.

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:45.980
So to conclude this portion of our talk about avoiding

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.779
these peace disturbers, we say,

00:09:49.779 --> 00:09:53.580
may we all strive to be genuine peacemakers

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:58.019
analyzing ourselves, praying for Jehovah's spirit

00:09:58.019 --> 00:10:02.019
to help us to avoid any tendency to be jealous,

00:10:02.019 --> 00:10:06.700
to envy, or to be contentious with our brothers.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:10.700
But now let's talk about some things we can do personally

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.860
to promote peace and joy.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:17.299
In fact, let's talk quickly about six things we can do.

00:10:17.299 --> 00:10:22.379
Number one, cultivate humility and modesty.

00:10:22.379 --> 00:10:26.820
Humility means to consider others superior to ourselves.

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:31.179
Modesty means to be aware of our own limitations.

00:10:31.179 --> 00:10:35.059
Now if we have those two closely related qualities,

00:10:35.059 --> 00:10:39.179
we'll be able to apply Romans chapter 12, verse three,

00:10:39.179 --> 00:10:42.259
which says we should not think more of ourselves

00:10:42.259 --> 00:10:44.740
than it is necessary to think,

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:48.940
but to think so as to have a sound mind.

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:52.580
Here's the second thing we can do to promote joy and peace.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:59.419
Appreciate and value the good qualities and talents of others.

00:10:59.419 --> 00:11:03.220
Focus on their good points, not their flaws.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.580
And how thankful we can be that Jehovah does that with us.

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:09.019
Otherwise, we'd be doomed, wouldn't we?

00:11:09.019 --> 00:11:12.700
But maybe you heard the illustration of a brother

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.820
holding up a white piece of paper

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:18.500
with a red spot in the middle

00:11:18.539 --> 00:11:22.100
and asking an audience what they see.

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.940
We'll most say they see a red spot.

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.299
But then he points out that actually 99%

00:11:27.299 --> 00:11:31.139
of what they're looking at is white paper.

00:11:31.139 --> 00:11:33.899
But we tend to notice the spot.

00:11:33.899 --> 00:11:34.899
Well, if we're not careful,

00:11:34.899 --> 00:11:36.139
that's what we can do with our brothers.

00:11:36.139 --> 00:11:39.259
Notice that flaw rather than all the good qualities.

00:11:39.259 --> 00:11:44.259
But may all of us cultivate the Jehovah-like quality

00:11:45.059 --> 00:11:50.139
of noticing, appreciating, and valuing

00:11:50.139 --> 00:11:53.419
the good qualities of our brothers.

00:11:53.419 --> 00:11:55.659
Now here's the third thing we can do.

00:11:55.659 --> 00:11:58.419
Never presume that fellow Christians

00:11:58.419 --> 00:12:01.019
are trying to outdo us.

00:12:01.019 --> 00:12:03.259
1 Corinthians 137 says,

00:12:03.259 --> 00:12:06.580
love believes, love hopes all things.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.860
So we believe we hope that our brothers

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.980
are doing what they're doing out of a good motive

00:12:13.019 --> 00:12:16.220
to please Jehovah, not to outdo us.

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:19.700
And we remember Jehovah's appointed only one judge, Jesus.

00:12:20.659 --> 00:12:21.820
We are no judge.

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:26.820
We have no right to negatively judge our brothers' motives.

00:12:27.419 --> 00:12:29.620
Now here's the fourth thing we can do.

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:34.500
Strive to always rejoice over our brothers' privileges

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.460
and successes.

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:41.179
Romans 12, 15, rejoice with those who rejoice.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:43.779
Weep with those who weep.

00:12:43.779 --> 00:12:45.779
Now which is easier?

00:12:45.779 --> 00:12:48.820
Well generally it's not so hard to weep

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.419
with someone who's had some tragedy.

00:12:51.419 --> 00:12:53.860
But now what if some really good things happen to them

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.580
and it hasn't happened to us?

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:57.340
I'm so happy.

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:59.539
I just got appointed as a regular pioneer.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.620
Now we were really hoping to get into the pioneer

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:06.100
work ourselves, but we haven't been able to do it.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.740
Are we gonna really be happy from our heart

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:10.179
with our brother?

00:13:10.179 --> 00:13:14.059
Well, if we love our brother and we love Jehovah,

00:13:14.059 --> 00:13:15.740
then we're gonna work really hard

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.740
to have that right attitude from our heart.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:22.740
See, we will smash any hint of jealousy

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.259
we'll smash it with love.

00:13:26.299 --> 00:13:28.740
Now here's a fifth thing we can do.

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:33.740
Faithfully support those who serve in responsible positions

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:38.379
such as the elders and obviously doing that.

00:13:38.419 --> 00:13:41.379
Supporting these ones or taking the lead

00:13:41.379 --> 00:13:45.659
definitely promotes peace and joy in the congregation.

00:13:45.659 --> 00:13:47.139
Here's one more thing,

00:13:47.139 --> 00:13:52.139
center your life on serving Jehovah and helping others.

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.980
Rather than focusing on ourselves,

00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:00.980
maybe our feelings, our perceived reputation.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.580
If we focus on serving Jehovah

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:06.019
and helping our brothers,

00:14:06.019 --> 00:14:10.779
we'll truly be peace promoters in the congregation.

00:14:10.779 --> 00:14:13.059
By doing those six things,

00:14:13.059 --> 00:14:15.460
we'll prove that we're peacemakers,

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:19.779
peace promoters who are reflecting the wisdom from above.

00:14:19.779 --> 00:14:20.779
Now that's the thought again,

00:14:20.779 --> 00:14:23.299
let's go back to James chapter three,

00:14:23.299 --> 00:14:25.700
that wisdom from above.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.460
Now that's what we want to reflect.

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.700
James chapter three,

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.539
and let's take a look this time at verse number 13.

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:37.740
Who is wise in understanding among you?

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:43.580
Let him by his fine conduct demonstrate works performed

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:47.700
with a myleness that comes from wisdom

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.860
and then drop down to verse 17.

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:54.460
But the wisdom from above is first of all pure,

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:57.779
then, now notice, peaceable.

00:14:57.779 --> 00:15:01.220
It didn't say peaceful, passive, peaceable.

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.059
That means a peacemaker.

00:15:03.059 --> 00:15:07.820
Reasonable, ready to obey full of mercy and good fruits,

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:10.580
impartial, not hypocritical.

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:14.179
Moreover, the fruit of righteousness is sung

00:15:14.179 --> 00:15:19.179
in peaceful conditions for those who are making peace.

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:24.899
Yes, we're encouraged to be a peacemaker.

00:15:24.899 --> 00:15:28.899
And when we do this, we bring joy to ourselves.

00:15:28.899 --> 00:15:31.019
We impart joy to others.

00:15:31.019 --> 00:15:36.019
And most importantly, we make Jehovah rejoice.

00:15:36.019 --> 00:15:37.940
But now think about this.

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.179
What's a peacemaker?

00:15:40.179 --> 00:15:43.299
Doesn't mean always a peacemaker.

00:15:43.299 --> 00:15:46.379
We have to keep working at this quality.

00:15:46.379 --> 00:15:48.700
Now this will be well illustrated

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:52.299
in the following video interview.

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:57.580
I got married in 2002.

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:00.779
Around that time, I was appointed a ministerial servant

00:16:00.779 --> 00:16:03.659
and my wife and I were serving as regular pioneers.

00:16:05.179 --> 00:16:08.259
In 2004, we were given the opportunity

00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:09.940
to serve as special pioneers.

00:16:11.059 --> 00:16:13.980
It was something that we really wanted

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:16.620
because we wanted to do more for Jehovah.

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:20.340
So when we got that assignment, we were delighted.

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:28.379
The brothers in the congregation were also very happy for us.

00:16:28.379 --> 00:16:30.620
But everything did not go smoothly.

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:33.659
As time went on, I faced some difficult situations.

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:37.779
The fact that I was not appointed as an elder

00:16:37.779 --> 00:16:42.480
made me feel disappointed.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.799
In one congregation, two brothers

00:16:44.799 --> 00:16:47.480
who had served as ministerial servants for a shorter time

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:51.899
than I had were appointed as elders.

00:16:51.899 --> 00:16:53.820
I felt that those brothers did not have

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:56.139
as much experience as I had.

00:16:56.139 --> 00:16:58.740
I thought, I am the one with the experience.

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:00.820
So why didn't I get appointed?

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:03.220
I started to question my own qualifications

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:07.079
and this made me very sad.

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:09.440
After the two brothers were appointed,

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.839
I started to dislike them.

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:14.160
I was also angry with them

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:19.960
and the anger even progressed a little toward hatred.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:23.200
It was a real challenge for me to serve in that congregation

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.759
at any meetings was difficult.

00:17:25.759 --> 00:17:27.799
I would go with the heavy heart.

00:17:29.319 --> 00:17:32.359
I put a lot of effort into making personal changes,

00:17:32.359 --> 00:17:36.119
changing my attitude and getting rid of my negative traits.

00:17:36.119 --> 00:17:38.079
I knew that if I did nothing,

00:17:38.079 --> 00:17:41.119
it was going to affect the worship I give to Jehovah

00:17:41.119 --> 00:17:43.440
and also the relationship with my brothers.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:48.200
My wife and I could end up completely losing our joy.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.920
In order to make things right,

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.920
I prayed intensely to Jehovah.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.039
I spent time in deep personal Bible study.

00:17:57.039 --> 00:17:58.720
My wife would also find articles

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.839
about maintaining peace with the brothers

00:18:00.839 --> 00:18:02.880
and would give them to me to read.

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.720
She even selected kingdom songs

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.440
that dealt with maintaining peace

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:11.059
and she would sing them to me.

00:18:11.059 --> 00:18:13.259
I made a lot of changes to my attitude

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:15.420
and worked hard to progress as a person

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:16.859
whom Jehovah would approve.

00:18:18.019 --> 00:18:21.059
I tried to view my brothers the same way Jehovah did

00:18:21.059 --> 00:18:26.059
and to serve him with joy.

00:18:26.059 --> 00:18:28.539
I really wanted to give my best to Jehovah

00:18:28.539 --> 00:18:29.579
and to the brothers.

00:18:30.579 --> 00:18:33.700
At the same time, I did not want those wrong thoughts

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:39.690
to ever come back into my heart.

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:42.089
The valuable lessons that I have learned

00:18:42.089 --> 00:18:44.490
is that privileges are not more important.

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:46.289
Rather, it is serving Jehovah

00:18:46.289 --> 00:18:48.289
that brings genuine happiness.

00:18:48.369 --> 00:18:51.609
And now I am finding real joy and satisfaction

00:18:51.609 --> 00:18:55.539
in my service to Jehovah.

00:18:55.539 --> 00:18:58.380
So may each of us prayerfully work

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:03.380
to have the attitude of wanting to be a peacemaker.

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:07.700
And when we do this, we prove to Jehovah

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:11.380
we're the kinder person that he wants in his new world.

00:19:12.299 --> 00:19:15.980
In Psalm 37 11, it says of the new world,

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:18.059
the make will possess the earth

00:19:18.059 --> 00:19:21.019
and they will find their exquisite delight

00:19:21.019 --> 00:19:23.900
in the abundance of peace.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.859
So the new world will be a very peaceful place.

00:19:26.859 --> 00:19:29.579
But if we're a peace promoter now,

00:19:29.579 --> 00:19:31.539
we will convince Jehovah

00:19:31.539 --> 00:19:35.819
that we will be an asset toward that peace of his new world.

00:19:35.819 --> 00:19:37.059
And think about this.

00:19:37.059 --> 00:19:40.500
In the new world, it will be natural

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:44.619
for perfect people to just display peace.

00:19:44.619 --> 00:19:49.619
This beautiful aspect of the fruitage of Jehovah's Holy Spirit.

00:19:50.059 --> 00:19:52.339
But right now we have to work at it, don't we?

00:19:52.339 --> 00:19:54.220
We have to seek peace pursuant.

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:57.660
But if we're a peace pursuer now,

00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:00.220
we will convince Jehovah

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:03.460
that we will be a peace displayer

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:05.259
in his righteous new world.

00:20:05.259 --> 00:20:07.460
And he'll want us to be there.

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:10.099
So let's diligently promote peace

00:20:11.059 --> 00:20:14.180
and contribute toward the strength

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:18.460
the happiness of Jehovah's beautiful organization,

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.779
which really is a modern day miracle,

00:20:20.779 --> 00:20:25.619
remembering that those who promote peace have joy

00:20:25.619 --> 00:20:28.460
and they impart joy to others

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:31.500
and they make Jehovah's heart rejoice.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.819
And all of that rejoicing will last forever.
