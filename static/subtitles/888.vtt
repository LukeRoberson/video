00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:04.219
When was Jesus Christ born?

00:00:04.219 --> 00:00:07.919
Many would answer December 25th.

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.320
On that date, Christmas is celebrated worldwide,

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.019
even in many non-Christian countries.

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.120
The Bible does not give an exact date for Jesus' birth,

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.019
but it does indicate something that would surprise many.

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:26.019
He was not born in the winter.

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:28.219
How do we know?

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.420
First, the Bible tells us that at the time of Jesus' birth,

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.119
shepherds were living out of doors

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:38.920
and keeping watch in the night over their flocks.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.219
For much of the year,

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.520
shepherds in Bethlehem spent the night outside with their flocks,

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.219
but not during their cold, rainy,

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.219
occasionally snowy winter months.

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.020
Instead, in winter,

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.520
shepherds protected their flocks from the elements

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.020
by keeping them under shelter.

00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:02.619
Second, the Bible tells us that around the time of Jesus' birth,

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:07.219
Caesar Augustus ordered a general census.

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:08.620
To comply with it,

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.420
Jesus' parents had to travel at least 110 kilometers

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.620
or 68 miles from Nazareth to Bethlehem.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.120
It is unlikely that Augustus would order the Jews

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.620
who were already inclined to revolt

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.920
to make long trips in the harsh conditions of winter.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.420
Third, the Bible points to a different time for Jesus' birth.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.519
The book of Luke says that Jesus was baptized

00:01:36.519 --> 00:01:40.519
and began his work at about 30 years of age,

00:01:40.519 --> 00:01:43.819
and Daniel prophesied that Jesus' ministry

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:48.019
would last three and a half years.

00:01:48.019 --> 00:01:51.620
Jesus died on the Passover in the spring

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.719
at 33 and a half years of age.

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:59.519
So his birth, 33 and a half years earlier,

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:02.519
would have been in autumn.

00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:06.219
Thus, the Bible indicates that Jesus was born

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:08.719
not in winter, but in autumn.
