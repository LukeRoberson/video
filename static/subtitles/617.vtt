00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:09.199
For our text today provides a beautiful example of how Jehovah and Jesus love those who love what is right.

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:14.199
But what are some of the circumstances that led up to this text being written?

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:18.199
And what can we benefit or how can we benefit from it today?

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.199
But let's first look at a prayer that relates to this account offered by Jesus.

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.199
Please turn with me to John chapter 17.

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:34.990
And we'll recall in this account, Jesus was about to be arrested, tried and executed.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.990
But he was deeply concerned about his followers.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.990
So notice the request that he made of his father.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.990
That's verse 15.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:54.990
I do not request that you take them out of the world, but that you watch over them because of the wicked one.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.990
Now notice that Jesus said, watch over them. Those three key words.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.990
What does that mean?

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:08.989
What means to not be a policeman, but to have a protective care of someone?

00:01:08.989 --> 00:01:14.989
Now the original language word actually means to guard from loss or injury by keeping an eye on.

00:01:15.989 --> 00:01:20.989
So we think about a shepherd that watches over his sheep during the night.

00:01:21.989 --> 00:01:27.989
Or a caring father that looks out for his little children to prevent them from getting harmed.

00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:33.989
Well, that's the sense that Jesus had in trying to get protection for his followers.

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:37.989
And we're sure that Jehovah heard that selfless prayer.

00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:45.989
Now with that prayer in mind, let's fast forward to a few years later and Paul's second missionary tour.

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:49.989
The spirit has directed Paul to step over into Macedonia.

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:52.989
Then to Athens and then to Corinth.

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:54.989
And that's where we pick up the action.

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:57.989
So if you turn to Acts chapter 18,

00:01:57.989 --> 00:02:04.989
we're going to see that Paul has become intensely occupied with the word in verse five.

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:06.989
Now he faces headwinds.

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:11.990
Headwinds are strong opposition from the Jews.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.990
What does he do?

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.990
Well, he has to face the situation.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.990
Does he stay there and that assignment sticking it out?

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.990
Perhaps risking his life?

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.990
Or does he try to go to say for harbours?

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.990
A safe for city where the situation is much calmer?

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.990
Well, surely this stressed out Paul.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.990
And he would besiege Jehovah about this matter.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.990
But notice the answer that he receives in verse nine.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.270
It says more over the Lord said to Paul in a vision by night.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.270
Do not be afraid.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.270
But keep on speaking and do not keep silent.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.270
For I am with you.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.270
And no man will assault you to harm you.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.270
For I have many people in this city.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.270
And did you see what the Lord Jesus said?

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.270
He said, do not be afraid.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.270
I am with you.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.270
Well, how that must have reassured the apostle Paul.

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.270
He was stressed.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.270
But this must have calmed him down.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.270
Because he knew that he was going to be well cared for.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.270
He was being looked out for.

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.270
And perhaps it reminded the apostle Paul of the words of Jeremiah,

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.270
Jeremiah chapter one verse eight,

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:34.270
where Jehovah told him to do not be afraid for I am with you to save you.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.270
Well, how that must have reassured Jeremiah because he continued in his ministry

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.270
for some 67 years.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.270
Now, the apostle Paul is an outstanding example.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.270
And you could say one of the foremost examples of missionaries.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.270
And we think about missionaries this weekend.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.270
We have the Gilead graduation coming up of the 155th class.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.270
But starting in 1943 and up until recent years,

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.270
there have been thousands of intrepid missionaries that have gone throughout the earth,

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.270
laying the groundwork for the expansion of the organization in the 20th century,

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.270
especially the latter part.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.270
What is it easy for them?

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.269
No, it wasn't.

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.269
But they rest assured that Jehovah was with them and that assignment.

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.269
And they were able to be successful in what they did.

00:04:25.269 --> 00:04:28.269
Now, the purpose of Gilead has changed, hasn't it?

00:04:28.269 --> 00:04:31.269
But the spirit has not changed.

00:04:31.269 --> 00:04:36.269
The students and the graduates are still reliant on Jehovah,

00:04:36.269 --> 00:04:39.269
fully reliant to be successful.

00:04:39.269 --> 00:04:42.269
And it's the same spirit that we have here at Bethel.

00:04:42.269 --> 00:04:47.269
We see Bethelites who are going through difficulties, perhaps with family or their own health.

00:04:47.269 --> 00:04:52.269
But they are fully reliant on Jehovah, knowing that Jehovah is going to help them

00:04:52.269 --> 00:04:57.269
to be successful in their assignment.

00:04:57.269 --> 00:05:02.269
Now, there's an interesting part of verse 10 that we want to key in on.

00:05:02.269 --> 00:05:07.269
Because it shows that in Jehovah and Jesus' interest and concern for people

00:05:07.269 --> 00:05:10.269
extends to those in the ministry.

00:05:10.269 --> 00:05:13.269
Look at the last part of verse 10.

00:05:13.269 --> 00:05:17.269
It says, for I have many people in this city.

00:05:17.269 --> 00:05:20.269
Well, that's quite a remarkable expression, isn't it?

00:05:20.269 --> 00:05:25.269
Because in this city, Corinth, it was a very wealthy city.

00:05:25.269 --> 00:05:28.269
It had many distractions. They had materialism.

00:05:28.269 --> 00:05:34.269
They had entertainment, politics, and they had very low morals.

00:05:34.269 --> 00:05:40.269
In fact, you could say that Corinth was the sin city of its day.

00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:46.269
But despite that environment, despite that culture, Jesus saw through the sin

00:05:46.269 --> 00:05:51.269
and the layers of imperfection to what the Corinthians were at heart.

00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:58.269
He saw individuals that were honest, individuals that were humble,

00:05:58.269 --> 00:06:02.269
individuals that were righteously disposed.

00:06:02.269 --> 00:06:06.269
So instead of seeing these individuals as they were,

00:06:06.269 --> 00:06:12.269
he saw potential, what they could become with Holy Spirit.

00:06:12.269 --> 00:06:18.269
Now, it was so interesting that Paul was also able to see this transformation

00:06:18.269 --> 00:06:21.269
that was going to be possible.

00:06:21.269 --> 00:06:24.269
And it's interesting that he wrote to Timothy later on,

00:06:24.269 --> 00:06:27.269
1 Timothy chapter 2.

00:06:27.269 --> 00:06:30.269
This is fine and acceptable on the side of our Savior, God,

00:06:30.269 --> 00:06:33.269
whose will is that all sorts of people should be saved

00:06:33.269 --> 00:06:36.269
and come to an accurate knowledge of the truth.

00:06:36.269 --> 00:06:39.269
Now, did the Apostle Paul have in mind these Corinthians

00:06:39.269 --> 00:06:43.269
when he wrote this quite possibly?

00:06:43.269 --> 00:06:46.269
So what can we take away from this?

00:06:46.269 --> 00:06:48.269
To see potential in others.

00:06:48.269 --> 00:06:51.269
For example, when we're out in the ministry,

00:06:51.269 --> 00:06:56.269
we want to see that these ones have potential to make drastic changes

00:06:56.269 --> 00:06:58.269
to become our fellow believers.

00:06:58.269 --> 00:07:02.269
And many of them have lifestyles that are similar to the Corinthians.

00:07:02.269 --> 00:07:06.269
But by applying Bible principles with Holy Spirit,

00:07:06.269 --> 00:07:10.269
they can make changes and they can become our fellow believers.

00:07:10.269 --> 00:07:15.269
And when we think about that, that helps us to seize opportunities

00:07:15.269 --> 00:07:18.269
and give a witness because we simply don't know

00:07:18.269 --> 00:07:23.269
how their circumstances are going to change and turn out.

00:07:23.269 --> 00:07:26.269
Now, here's another point that we can take away from this.

00:07:26.269 --> 00:07:30.269
We work closely with ones at Bethel and in the congregation.

00:07:30.269 --> 00:07:33.269
And sometimes the closer you work with somebody,

00:07:33.269 --> 00:07:38.269
the more mistakes you see, the more faults you see.

00:07:38.269 --> 00:07:41.269
But the question that we need to ask is,

00:07:41.269 --> 00:07:44.269
do we also see their good qualities?

00:07:44.269 --> 00:07:49.269
Do we also see how Jehovah's spirit is molding them to be a better person?

00:07:49.269 --> 00:07:52.269
And are we seeing their potential?

00:07:52.269 --> 00:07:56.269
Can we imagine what our workmates are going to look like

00:07:56.269 --> 00:08:01.269
in the new world after Jehovah's helped them to be able to realize their potential?

00:08:01.269 --> 00:08:09.100
Well, if so, we are seeing them as Jehovah and Jesus too.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.100
Now, the Apostle Paul stayed in Corinth for some 18 months

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:16.100
to establish a congregation and then he continued his missionary tour.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:21.100
And then worldly influences began to creep into the congregation.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.100
Now, although they experienced problems,

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:29.100
did that mean that Jehovah and Jesus were no longer washing over them?

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.100
Well, that's not the case at all.

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:34.100
In fact, we know that Jehovah's spirit is active.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:40.100
And so it moved the Apostle Paul later on to write the first letter to the Corinthians.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:44.100
And let's open to that counsel that was given to them,

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:47.100
1 Corinthians chapter 6, verse 9.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.100
This is our text for today.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:58.700
Now, this is doing a pause, a third missionary tour that he wrote this.

00:08:58.700 --> 00:08:59.700
And he said,

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:04.700
Do you not know that unrighteous people will not inherit God's kingdom?

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:05.700
Do not be misled.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.700
Those who are sexually immoral,

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:13.700
idolaters, adopters, men who submit to homosexual acts,

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.700
those who practice homosexuality,

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.700
thieves, greedy people,

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:19.700
drunkards,

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.700
revilers, and extortioners

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.700
will not inherit God's kingdom.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.700
This is some strong counsel.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:29.700
You can imagine being at the meeting when this letter is being read.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.700
But then look at verse 11.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.700
And yet that is what some of you were.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.700
But you have been washed clean,

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.700
you have been sanctified,

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.700
you have been declared righteous in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.700
and with the spirit of our God.

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:50.700
What excellent counsel to help these Christians get back on track?

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:52.700
It called them to their senses,

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:56.700
and reminded them of who they really were, their Christian identity.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.700
It helped them to be able to see how they could have a clean,

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.700
standing with Jehovah,

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:06.700
and to work on developing and cultivating a stronger relationship with them.
