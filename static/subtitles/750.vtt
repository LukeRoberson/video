WEBVTT

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.040
What this time we have the pleasure to hear from another member of the governing body,

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:13.960
Brother David's plane, and the title of his talk is Follow the Course of Humility.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:22.559
All of you are humble people.

00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:27.600
If you weren't, you'd never have been invited to Gilead.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.679
Have you ever noticed, though, that where humility is concerned,

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:38.679
we do well in some situations, not so well in others.

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:43.119
For example, if someone commends us for a good job on a talk on the midweek meeting,

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:47.439
or perhaps a comment on the watchtower study,

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:52.159
we give all credit to Jehovah, and to the training we've received.

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:54.240
And that's good.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.520
But in other situations, we might get into trouble.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:05.280
In other situations, our humility might be put to the tests.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.000
Now at Bethel, as has been mentioned on this program already,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.200
we all work with people.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.239
We all work closely with others.

00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:19.159
As some of you sisters work on a team.

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:20.680
You work with others.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.680
And you brothers, you all have responsibilities in the congregation,

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.920
or at Bethel, or perhaps both.

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:32.760
But in all situations, humility is needed.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.680
So I thought that this morning we might consider what we can learn about

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:44.959
your humility from Jehovah God, and from the apostles of Jesus Christ.

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:48.280
Now, humility is a broad term.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.239
So let's narrow it down a little bit.

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:54.840
Let's consider a couple of aspects of humility.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.040
And the first one I'm going to mention might surprise you.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.480
A insight on the Scriptures tells us that humility

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:08.479
includes the ability to show mercy and compassion to others.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:15.800
The ability to show mercy and compassion to others.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.800
The ability to make exceptions where that is warranted.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.960
Well, that's Jehovah, isn't it?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.960
Jehovah isn't rigid.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.719
Jehovah knows when to make exceptions.

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:37.240
How often did you read in the Bible as you went through?

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.840
Jehovah reconsidered.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.039
Jehovah makes perfect rules.

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:46.840
And yet at times he reconsideres.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.960
Now let's illustrate.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.439
These relights are getting ready to conquer the promised land.

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:56.039
And the first up is the city of Jericho.

00:02:56.039 --> 00:03:01.000
Now there's a rule, a rule of engagement, and it's very clear.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.039
Jehovah says, you must not make any covenant with them

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:11.439
or show them any favor.

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:15.840
No covenant, no favor, that's the rule.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.680
It's a perfect rule because it's Jehovah's rule.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.080
Joshua sent two spies into the city

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.919
and they went to the home of a prostitute named Rahab.

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:32.039
Now wait a minute.

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:34.199
Let's think about that.

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:36.360
Pretty easy to say, isn't it?

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.599
Joshua sent two spies into the city.

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:44.680
They went into a house of a prostitute named Rahab.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.599
Now we often think about the faith of Rahab.

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:53.400
But what about the faith of those two spies?

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.680
Can you imagine the faith that it took for those men?

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.400
The Bible says they were young men to go into that city.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.840
Now if they were under 40 years of age,

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.520
they were born in the wilderness.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.699
How many cities had they ever seen?

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:18.459
Had they ever seen a city before?

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.819
How many actual houses had they entered?

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:27.500
How many foreigners had they ever met?

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.500
Maybe not very many.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.819
Maybe a couple on the other side of the Jordan,

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:33.420
but not very many.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.660
So now, as soon as they enter the city, what happens?

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.180
Someone calls the police.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.540
They're recognized right away.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.899
And no wonder, first of all, they

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:47.379
weren't dressed like canonites.

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:49.819
You couldn't order your clothes from Amazon.

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:53.779
And those days, you know, they were

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:55.379
dressed like Israelites.

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:59.939
They probably had on 40-year-old hand-me-downs

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:04.410
from their fathers who had died in the desert.

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.569
So they didn't look like canonites.

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:08.009
They didn't blend in.

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:10.930
And as soon as they opened their mouth,

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.410
people would say, you're not from around here.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:14.689
Are you?

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:17.610
You don't speak the canonite language.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.529
So no wonder they were discovered.

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:23.850
They had to get off the street.

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.730
They had to get out of sight.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:30.449
And you wonder if Jehovah directed them to Rahab.

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:34.170
You wonder if Jehovah saw something in Rahab, something

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.209
in her heart that he could work with.

00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:40.850
Or do you believe that it was a coincidence

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.850
that the spies were led to the only family in Jericho

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.250
that was worth saving?

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.290
It could be that Jehovah was involved with that.

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.610
Well, Rahab decides that she's going to hide the spies.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.290
But she has a condition.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.970
And if you'd like to turn to judges,

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.120
Joshua, or rather, chapter 2, we'll

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.399
see what that condition was.

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:08.560
I'll give you a moment.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:14.250
We're going to read that Joshua, chapter 2, and verse 13.

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:15.009
This is Rahab.

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:19.490
Now, we don't know how she communicated with them.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.889
Must have been a lot of sign language.

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:22.970
We heard about sign language a minute ago.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.689
Must have been about a lot of sign language going on

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:28.769
because the canonite language wasn't quite like Hebrew,

00:06:28.769 --> 00:06:31.089
but anyway, somehow they got the point across.

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:33.569
And here's what she says in verse 13.

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:39.329
You must spare the lives of my father and mother,

00:06:39.329 --> 00:06:44.649
my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them.

00:06:44.649 --> 00:06:47.329
And you must save us from death.

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:50.290
What's she asking for?

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:54.970
She's asking for an exception.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:56.649
There's a rule.

00:06:56.649 --> 00:07:00.529
You must not make any covenant with them.

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:04.329
You must not show them any favor.

00:07:04.329 --> 00:07:05.970
And she's asking for an exception.

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:07.810
And quite a broad exception.

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.610
She's asking not just for her own life,

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.649
but for the lives of all of her family members,

00:07:13.649 --> 00:07:18.170
as well some might have thought that she was pushing it.

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.009
But she asked for that.

00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:24.689
And the spies showed favor to Rahab.

00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:26.370
They made an exception.

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.769
And they promised that when the time came,

00:07:28.769 --> 00:07:33.689
Rahab and her family would be spared.

00:07:33.689 --> 00:07:36.410
The Bible doesn't criticize the spies

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.490
for making that exception.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.930
So it may be that Jehovah had something to do with it.

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:43.730
Maybe Jehovah moved the spies in that direction.

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:48.490
Maybe Jehovah saw something in Rahab that he wanted to save.

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:52.689
Now later on, Joshua and the elders,

00:07:52.689 --> 00:07:54.889
they didn't follow instructions.

00:07:54.889 --> 00:07:56.970
And they made a covenant with the Ghiblianites.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.769
And the Bible does mention that.

00:07:58.769 --> 00:08:02.170
But it doesn't mention this when it comes to the spies here.

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:03.370
They made the exception.

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:07.089
And we do know that Jehovah agreed with that exception.

00:08:07.089 --> 00:08:08.889
How do we know that?

00:08:08.889 --> 00:08:13.129
Because when he made the walls of Jericho fall,

00:08:13.129 --> 00:08:15.689
he preserved the section of the wall

00:08:15.689 --> 00:08:19.490
where Rahab's family lived.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:26.970
Jehovah agreed to an exception to his perfect rule.

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:30.449
Now you know where I'm going with this.

00:08:30.449 --> 00:08:32.570
We need rules.

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:36.610
And most of the time a rule will satisfy our needs.

00:08:36.649 --> 00:08:39.929
But in a few cases, it only makes sense

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:43.450
to make an exception to the rule.

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:45.970
I'm reminded of the time not too long ago

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:49.649
when the Bethel family moved out of Brooklyn.

00:08:49.649 --> 00:08:51.049
Now there are a lot of Bethelites

00:08:51.049 --> 00:08:54.889
in the congregations who were elders and ministerial servants.

00:08:54.889 --> 00:08:58.529
And so a massive reorganization of congregations

00:08:58.529 --> 00:09:01.370
was necessary in New York City.

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:04.250
And the elders and the circuit overseers

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:06.169
had to make sure that each congregation

00:09:06.169 --> 00:09:08.929
had a balanced number of elders, ministerial servants,

00:09:08.929 --> 00:09:09.889
and publishers.

00:09:09.889 --> 00:09:13.970
And so publishers were assigned to various congregations.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:17.649
Can you imagine hundreds of thousands of assignments

00:09:17.649 --> 00:09:18.490
that had to be made?

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.529
And so there was a rule.

00:09:20.529 --> 00:09:22.289
And it was a pretty good rule.

00:09:22.289 --> 00:09:26.250
And the rule was, go where you're assigned.

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:30.450
We don't have time to consider the personal feelings

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:32.889
about every publisher in New York City.

00:09:32.889 --> 00:09:35.690
So please, go where you're assigned.

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:37.649
That was the rule.

00:09:37.649 --> 00:09:41.730
Now there were two sisters, single sisters,

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:44.690
who were assigned to a congregation.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:46.809
They didn't have a car.

00:09:46.809 --> 00:09:48.809
And you couldn't reach the congregation

00:09:48.809 --> 00:09:52.289
they were assigned to by public transportation.

00:09:52.289 --> 00:09:56.570
And so they were going to have to walk to the Kingdom Hall.

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:59.250
And the area where the Kingdom Hall was located

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:02.570
was very dangerous.

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:05.970
Their safety would have been involved.

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:07.690
Well, you had a rule.

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:10.370
Go where you're assigned.

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:14.889
But the circuit overseer lovingly made an exception.

00:10:14.889 --> 00:10:19.009
So the point is, we do need rules.

00:10:19.009 --> 00:10:22.769
And most of the time, our rules, even our imperfect rules,

00:10:22.769 --> 00:10:25.649
will serve most of the brothers.

00:10:25.649 --> 00:10:27.809
But let's use common sense.

00:10:27.809 --> 00:10:32.549
And there are times when we have to consider an exception.

00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:35.190
Now, can you think of anyone who was grateful

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:38.149
that Jehovah made an exception for Rahab?

00:10:38.149 --> 00:10:40.470
And she didn't die a Jericho?

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:41.870
Can you think of someone?

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:44.149
He was mentioned in this program.

00:10:44.149 --> 00:10:45.789
Boy has.

00:10:45.789 --> 00:10:48.029
The husband of Ruth.

00:10:48.029 --> 00:10:51.830
Rahab was his mother.

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:53.870
And think of this.

00:10:53.870 --> 00:11:01.389
If Rahab had died in Jericho, would there ever have been a David?

00:11:01.389 --> 00:11:03.309
Let's go on.

00:11:03.309 --> 00:11:06.870
Jehovah directed that seven nations in Canaan

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:08.830
were to be eliminated.

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:11.870
And the Ghiblianites were among them, but they had a plan.

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:14.909
They pretended to be from a far off nation

00:11:14.909 --> 00:11:17.669
that wasn't slated for destruction.

00:11:17.669 --> 00:11:20.230
And so the elders, not consulting Jehovah,

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:24.830
they made a vow that the Ghiblianites would be spared.

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:26.870
They made a covenant with the Ghiblianites.

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:30.070
Well, it wasn't long, but what the Israelites realized

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:31.789
they'd been tricked.

00:11:31.789 --> 00:11:36.110
But even though their oath had been obtained under false pre-tenses,

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:37.710
they agreed to keep their word.

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:41.669
But it's what happens next that's interesting.

00:11:41.669 --> 00:11:45.590
Five kings of the Amorites find out that the Israelites

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:49.789
and the Ghiblianites have made a covenant, and they are furious.

00:11:49.789 --> 00:11:54.590
And so they are determined to kill all the Ghiblianites,

00:11:54.590 --> 00:12:00.029
which was really what Jehovah had intended in the first place.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:01.909
What did Jehovah do?

00:12:01.909 --> 00:12:04.669
He could have said, well, that solves your problem.

00:12:04.669 --> 00:12:07.789
You promised the Ghiblianites that you wouldn't put them to death,

00:12:07.789 --> 00:12:11.710
so you can sit back and let the Amorites through the job.

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:14.190
But what did Jehovah do?

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:19.960
Joshua chapter 10 and verse 8.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:23.159
Now remember, he had had a rule.

00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:26.039
It had a rule that everyone was to be destroyed.

00:12:26.039 --> 00:12:32.440
Joshua chapter 10 and verse 8.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.159
Jehovah then said to Joshua,

00:12:35.159 --> 00:12:40.080
do not be afraid of them, for I have handed them over to you.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:45.919
Not one of them will be able to stand against you.

00:12:45.919 --> 00:12:48.639
Imagine this humility.

00:12:48.639 --> 00:12:53.120
Jehovah helps the Israelites to keep a promise

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.000
they had no business making.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.159
That is humility.

00:12:58.159 --> 00:13:00.120
Well, let's talk about Jesus' apostles.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.639
We can really learn humility from them as well.

00:13:03.639 --> 00:13:06.240
Now we often talk about the disputes they had,

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.960
but mostly that was before Pentecost.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.799
When you think about it, after Pentecost,

00:13:10.799 --> 00:13:12.799
it was a different story.

00:13:12.799 --> 00:13:16.279
What do we find about the apostles after Pentecost?

00:13:16.279 --> 00:13:19.480
Well, they weren't interested in taking credit for things,

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.279
and they weren't searching for the limelight.

00:13:22.279 --> 00:13:26.279
They were really a very self-effacing the apostles.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.240
Matthew wrote the first inspired book,

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.480
the first inspired history of Jesus Christ.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.159
Do we see Matthew's picture on every other page?

00:13:37.159 --> 00:13:38.960
Matthew giving a public talk.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.919
Matthew performing a miracle.

00:13:40.919 --> 00:13:42.759
Matthew shepherding.

00:13:42.759 --> 00:13:44.039
No.

00:13:44.039 --> 00:13:47.240
His name has only mentioned twice in the whole gospel.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:52.120
And both times, he describes himself as a tax collector,

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:55.120
not a very flattering portrayal.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.480
And what about the apostle John?

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:02.840
The name John appears 23 times in his gospel,

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:07.720
but it never refers to the apostle John.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:11.480
It almost always refers to John the Baptist.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.279
When the apostles and older men met

00:14:13.279 --> 00:14:15.080
to consider the matter of circumcision,

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.039
was that an important meeting?

00:14:17.039 --> 00:14:20.320
Would you agree that that was a landmark meeting?

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:24.720
The apostles and older men are there who presided.

00:14:24.759 --> 00:14:28.480
Which of the twelve was jockeying for position?

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.480
James, the brother of Jesus, not he wasn't even an apostle.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.039
He's the one who presided.

00:14:34.039 --> 00:14:38.200
And then later on when the decision was made,

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.399
who announced the decision?

00:14:40.399 --> 00:14:43.679
Again, James, you don't find Peter or John saying,

00:14:43.679 --> 00:14:45.600
well, you know, this is a pretty important decision.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.840
We think that one of us should announce it.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:54.000
The apostles had learned their lesson.

00:14:54.039 --> 00:14:57.159
Well, remember that when the circuit overseer visits.

00:14:57.159 --> 00:15:00.600
Now, you may have heavy responsibilities at Bethel.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.000
But when he visits a congregation,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.600
he's in charge that week.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.399
Follow his direction.

00:15:07.399 --> 00:15:10.240
Don't be critical of the circuit overseer.

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.200
And don't be afraid to let him know how much you appreciate

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.200
his service.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.679
And you know, our Bethel families here in the United States

00:15:16.679 --> 00:15:18.679
are such a wonderful example of that.

00:15:18.679 --> 00:15:21.799
When the circuit overseer first visit a Bethel congregation,

00:15:21.799 --> 00:15:26.200
they're a little bit nervous for about 10 minutes.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:30.879
But the Bethel family shows that they appreciate so much

00:15:30.879 --> 00:15:32.120
the council.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.519
And sometimes they talk about the circuit overseer's council

00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:37.639
for weeks after his visit.

00:15:37.639 --> 00:15:41.600
They really, deeply appreciate the visit of the circuit

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.159
overseer and they respect that man.

00:15:44.159 --> 00:15:47.679
And we know that you're going to do the same.

00:15:47.679 --> 00:15:51.240
Humble people are happy to contribute to the kingdom work.

00:15:51.279 --> 00:15:54.080
Anyway, they can just so they can contribute.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.120
They're not hung up on privileges.

00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:00.279
They're not hung up on prestige or on position.

00:16:00.279 --> 00:16:02.960
They don't seek the limelight.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.759
And in this regard, we're going to talk a little bit

00:16:04.759 --> 00:16:06.720
about the Apostle Paul.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.879
Now, Brother Lippold mentioned in his talk

00:16:08.879 --> 00:16:11.960
that Paul was not a man to boast.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.320
And that's quite true.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.960
Actually, Paul was a very humble man.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.360
Now, think about this.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:24.360
At the time, Paul was converted about 34 CE.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:27.480
Jesus told Ananias that Paul was going

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.879
to have a wonderful privilege.

00:16:29.879 --> 00:16:31.279
Let's read about it.

00:16:31.279 --> 00:16:34.320
Acts chapter 9.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:46.110
Acts chapter 9 and verse 15.

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:48.549
Acts 9 and 15.

00:16:48.549 --> 00:16:51.350
And this is Jesus to Ananias.

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:55.190
But the Lord said to him, go, because this man

00:16:55.230 --> 00:17:01.230
is a chosen vessel to me, to bear my name to the nations,

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:05.990
as well as to kings and to the sons of Israel.

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:07.910
A chosen vessel.

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:10.029
How about that?

00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:12.150
How did Paul react?

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:14.430
Did he let that go to his head?

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:16.190
Did he immediately go up to Jerusalem

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:18.430
and volunteer to be on the governing body,

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:19.750
saying, well, now that I'm anointed,

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:22.710
I can be on the governing body?

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:26.150
No, he stayed where he was in Damascus.

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:28.910
And he kept preaching the good news.

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:32.109
Now, in 36 CE, he did go up to world headquarters

00:17:32.109 --> 00:17:34.069
in Jerusalem.

00:17:34.069 --> 00:17:36.230
And how did he react?

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:39.230
Did he say, here I am, the chosen vessel.

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:42.890
I'm here to help you run the place.

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:45.250
He stayed with the Apostle Peter for a couple of weeks.

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:48.849
Apparently, Peter had moved to Jerusalem.

00:17:48.849 --> 00:17:50.890
But he kept preaching.

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:53.609
He just put his head to the ground

00:17:53.609 --> 00:17:55.730
and he kept preaching the good news

00:17:55.730 --> 00:18:00.049
until one day Jesus appeared to him

00:18:00.049 --> 00:18:02.490
when Paul was in the temple.

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:07.329
And he told Paul that he had to leave Jerusalem immediately

00:18:07.329 --> 00:18:10.849
because the Jews were out to kill him.

00:18:10.849 --> 00:18:12.730
How did Paul react?

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:17.210
Did he say, but the governing body is going to need me?

00:18:17.369 --> 00:18:20.930
If I leave, how will they manage without me?

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:23.369
They need my wisdom.

00:18:23.369 --> 00:18:27.130
Paul obeyed theocratic direction.

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:28.890
And he left.

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:32.009
He accepted a new assignment.

00:18:32.009 --> 00:18:35.160
Tarsus.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.920
Tarsus.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:41.039
What kind of assignment is that for a chosen vessel?

00:18:41.039 --> 00:18:43.440
It was out in the boondocks.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:48.519
It was 500 miles from the governing body in Jerusalem.

00:18:48.559 --> 00:18:52.559
How would the governing body get to know his wonderful qualities

00:18:52.559 --> 00:18:56.160
if he was 500 miles from Jerusalem?

00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:00.920
Paul went to Tarsus and he kept preaching.

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:03.319
We don't even know if there was a congregation of Tarsus

00:19:03.319 --> 00:19:07.519
when Paul got there, but Paul kept preaching.

00:19:07.519 --> 00:19:11.039
I was thinking of the lovely interview we just heard

00:19:11.039 --> 00:19:13.680
where the brother talked about how he eventually ended up

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.039
in the circuit work.

00:19:15.079 --> 00:19:20.279
But before that time, Jehovah gave him a little training.

00:19:20.279 --> 00:19:23.240
And perhaps that's what happened to the Apostle Paul.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:28.000
Do you know that Paul may have remained in Tarsus

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.480
for eight years preaching?

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:36.920
And then Barnabas came along.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.640
Eleven years after Paul's conversion,

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:43.680
Barnabas came along and invited him to Antioch.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:47.759
And from that time on, Paul started to have privileges.

00:19:47.759 --> 00:19:53.400
And five years after that, Paul wrote his first inspired letter

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.400
that we cherish to this day.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.599
Paul worked hard all his life.

00:19:58.599 --> 00:20:01.799
He did more than any of the 12 Apostles,

00:20:01.799 --> 00:20:05.599
but he was never upset that he wasn't counted among them.

00:20:05.599 --> 00:20:10.319
Paul appreciated the privileges he had.

00:20:10.319 --> 00:20:12.640
He viewed them as undeserved kindness,

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.400
and we know that your brothers and sisters

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.880
are going to do the same.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:19.599
You're invited to conduct a meeting for field service?

00:20:19.599 --> 00:20:21.279
Treasure the privilege.

00:20:21.279 --> 00:20:23.359
Any privilege that you receive,

00:20:23.359 --> 00:20:27.200
treasure it, has an expression of love from Jehovah.

00:20:28.559 --> 00:20:31.240
Well, when you go to your assignments,

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:35.240
many situations are going to test your humility.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:37.519
And I know that your brothers and sisters

00:20:37.519 --> 00:20:40.079
are going to pass the test.

00:20:40.079 --> 00:20:42.960
The branch asks you to work on a project.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:46.079
And deep down, you don't quite agree with it.

00:20:46.079 --> 00:20:48.839
Deep down, you really wonder if it's going to work.

00:20:48.839 --> 00:20:52.440
And you wonder if it's not going to be a waste of your time.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.920
But you're not going to put it on the back burner

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.759
and say, well, I'll get to it someday if I get time.

00:20:57.759 --> 00:20:59.400
You're not going to do that.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.599
You're going to put heart and soul into the project.

00:21:02.599 --> 00:21:06.799
You're going to pray to Jehovah to bless the project,

00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:12.079
the project that you didn't quite agree with.

00:21:12.079 --> 00:21:15.000
Or if you're asked to make a recommendation,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.839
and you favor one option over another,

00:21:18.839 --> 00:21:23.599
humility is going to move you to present all of the options,

00:21:23.599 --> 00:21:26.319
all of the pros and cons equally.

00:21:26.319 --> 00:21:29.480
You're not going to slant things, thinking, well, you know,

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.279
I'm going to have to help these brothers

00:21:31.279 --> 00:21:32.359
to make this decision.

00:21:32.359 --> 00:21:35.400
So I'll put a really heavy weight on the pros,

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.519
and I'm going to make it really light on the cons.

00:21:37.519 --> 00:21:38.960
Don't do that.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.519
I know that you're going to present everything honestly,

00:21:41.519 --> 00:21:43.000
and you're going to recognize that it's

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.119
the Holy Spirit that helps brothers to make decisions.

00:21:48.119 --> 00:21:50.839
Trust the Spirit to move the brothers,

00:21:50.839 --> 00:21:53.000
to do the right thing.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.960
Suppose you sisters are working on a team,

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:59.359
or you brothers are working on a body of elders.

00:21:59.359 --> 00:22:02.920
I know that not even in your heart of hearts,

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.160
you're going to think that you have the best judgment

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:09.079
on the team, and that while you can listen politely

00:22:09.079 --> 00:22:11.799
to the expressions of others, but really,

00:22:11.799 --> 00:22:13.960
yours is the only sensible conclusion,

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:15.880
and we hope that the brothers and sisters

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.279
are going to go along with us.

00:22:18.279 --> 00:22:21.200
You're not going to think that, because nobody's

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.599
right all the time.

00:22:23.599 --> 00:22:28.160
Jehovah's Spirit can work on any member of the team.

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.680
Don't get discouraged.

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:34.839
If every suggestion you make in a meeting, get shot down.

00:22:34.839 --> 00:22:37.200
It happens to the best of us.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.000
And there will be other meetings.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.480
And hopefully, some of them will go better for you.

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.839
Don't get discouraged.

00:22:43.839 --> 00:22:46.240
And don't decide, well, I'm not going to say anything anymore.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.480
I'm not going to contribute anymore.

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:49.839
Be humble.

00:22:49.839 --> 00:22:53.960
And recognize that at times, we may make suggestions

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:57.160
that don't make very much sense.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:00.079
I certainly appreciate the kind way

00:23:00.079 --> 00:23:01.640
the governing body deals with me

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:05.720
with some of my lamberian suggestions.

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:07.400
In your comments and your assignments

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.839
on the midweek meeting, use the knowledge

00:23:09.839 --> 00:23:13.000
you've gained at Gilead to build up.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.599
And I know you won't proofread the meetings.

00:23:16.599 --> 00:23:19.240
I don't think that was a good illustration.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.559
That scripture wasn't applied right.

00:23:21.559 --> 00:23:23.119
That isn't the right word.

00:23:23.119 --> 00:23:24.640
You won't do that.

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:28.279
Just sit back, relax, and enjoy the meetings.

00:23:28.279 --> 00:23:30.359
Take in the spiritual food.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.319
Rejoice in whatever the brothers and sisters

00:23:33.319 --> 00:23:37.009
have prepared for you.

00:23:37.009 --> 00:23:40.410
Well, I haven't told you anything you don't already know.

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:42.970
You're all humble people.

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:47.049
These are just reminders that all of us need.

00:23:47.049 --> 00:23:51.369
All of us are humble most of the time.

00:23:51.369 --> 00:23:55.369
We pray for the day when we'll be humble all of the time.

00:23:55.369 --> 00:23:59.970
And in the meantime, let's work on it, you and I.

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:02.250
Let's work on it together.

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:05.089
Let's follow the course of humility.

00:24:05.089 --> 00:24:11.170
If we do, we'll continue to be used by Jehovah.

00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:13.130
We love you.

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:24.869
May Jehovah bless you richly.

00:24:24.869 --> 00:24:26.910
Well, thank you very much, brothers

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:30.670
plain, for the excellent scriptural examples in that talk,

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:33.710
including above all, Jehovah's example.

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:37.990
And for the reminders that humble people follow rules

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:40.869
and humble people, though, are reasonable.

00:24:40.869 --> 00:24:44.910
Beautiful reminders and examples through that talk.

00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:49.309
Well, now, for the presentation of the diplomas,

00:24:49.309 --> 00:24:54.029
and I will be assisted in this by brother William Malenfant,

00:24:54.029 --> 00:25:02.970
a helper to the teaching committee.

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:06.450
First of all, we have brother and sister Chung,

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:17.450
and they will return to the Canada branch.

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:20.329
And here we have brother and sister Choupec.

00:25:20.329 --> 00:25:23.490
They'll return to the central Europe branch,

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:26.250
where the Choupec has been appointed to serve

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:28.170
on the branch committee.

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:35.420
That was just in Brooklyn.

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:38.579
And we have brother and sister De Choupec.

00:25:38.579 --> 00:25:41.059
They will return to the France branch.

00:25:41.059 --> 00:25:41.900
Very nice.

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:48.339
Can you help me, brother?

00:25:48.339 --> 00:25:52.859
Brother and sister Dolev will return to the Bulgaria branch.

00:25:52.859 --> 00:25:53.859
Thank you.

00:25:53.859 --> 00:26:00.299
That was great.

00:26:00.299 --> 00:26:03.019
And brother and sister Issa have been assigned

00:26:03.019 --> 00:26:05.940
to World Headquarters at Warwick,

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:10.740
where brother Issa will work with hospital information services.

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:17.529
Welcome.

00:26:17.529 --> 00:26:21.690
Brother and sister Grim have been assigned to the Ghana branch.

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:34.000
Brother Grim has been appointed to serve on the branch committee.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.400
Brother Kits has been assigned to the central Europe branch,

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.440
where he will work under the oversight

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:45.559
of World Headquarters Office of Public Information.

00:26:47.799 --> 00:26:53.319
Brother Grim.

00:26:53.319 --> 00:26:57.519
Brother Inguete will return to the Seronam branch.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:07.440
Brother and sister Peltonon have been assigned

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.079
to the central Europe branch.

00:27:10.079 --> 00:27:12.920
Brother Peltonon will work under the oversight

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:25.750
of World Headquarters Office of Public Information.

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:29.349
Brother Velev will return to the Bulgaria branch.

00:27:29.349 --> 00:27:36.630
Congratulations.

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:41.309
Brother Vita has been assigned to the Albania branch.

00:27:41.309 --> 00:27:47.200
Very nice.

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:51.559
Brother and sister Weaver will return to the Spain branch.

00:27:51.559 --> 00:28:12.119
Brother Weaver has been appointed to serve on the branch committee.

00:28:12.119 --> 00:28:16.119
OK, well, that was wonderful to share in.

00:28:16.119 --> 00:28:17.559
Now they're graduates.

00:28:17.559 --> 00:28:21.920
So at this time, we're pleased to present

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:43.119
the graduates of the 151st class of Gilead.

00:28:43.119 --> 00:28:45.000
There's a lot of love here today.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.440
That's wonderful.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.599
Well, we have a letter to be presented

00:28:49.599 --> 00:28:54.880
by one of the now graduates of the 151st class.

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:59.440
Brother Davita Vita from Italy going to Albania.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:07.549
We'll read that now at this time.

00:29:07.549 --> 00:29:12.269
To the governing body and better family, dear brothers,

00:29:12.269 --> 00:29:15.430
for the past five months, we have traveled through the Bible

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:18.470
from the first page to the last.

00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:21.750
We experienced the eat of the Sinai,

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:25.869
found ourselves in the depths of the Red Sea,

00:29:25.869 --> 00:29:29.029
in the narrow hallways of Jerusalem,

00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:32.430
and high up on Mount Hermann.

00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:36.549
We met the prophets, visited the temple,

00:29:36.549 --> 00:29:39.789
saw the awesome Celestia chariot,

00:29:39.789 --> 00:29:45.109
and enjoyed the precious company of Jesus and the Apostles.

00:29:45.109 --> 00:29:47.990
What is the result of our journey?

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:50.470
The very same that resulted for Job

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:55.829
after he encountered his God, great astonishment.

00:29:55.829 --> 00:29:58.230
Although he recognized that he would only

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:02.589
be able to understand just the fringes of his ways,

00:30:02.589 --> 00:30:06.309
it was enough to make him marvel at Jehovah.

00:30:06.349 --> 00:30:11.029
Now I know that you are able to do all things.

00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:14.390
At the same time, the experience humbled him

00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:18.069
that he put his hand over his mouth.

00:30:18.069 --> 00:30:21.150
That is how we feel today.

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:25.509
Gilead leaves us in its wake, filled with awe,

00:30:25.509 --> 00:30:28.630
humility and gratitude.

00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:32.670
Studying the Bible is studying about Jehovah himself,

00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:35.710
and what we have learned as impressed in our hearts

00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:40.950
the depth of Jehovah's love for each one of his servants.

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:44.430
We saw this love not only in numerous Bible accounts,

00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:48.150
but in those who imitate him and his son Jesus,

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:51.950
the governing body, our guest instructors,

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:55.470
our Gilead instructors, and the better family

00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:59.470
here at Patterson and in other complexes.

00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:02.470
Your example is a living answer to the question

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:06.029
how to define Christian love.

00:31:06.029 --> 00:31:09.990
We express our heartfelt thanks to you, the governing body,

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:15.190
and all those who made this unforgettable experience possible.

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:17.390
We know that is our divine education

00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:19.869
is not our possession alone.

00:31:19.869 --> 00:31:22.430
We receive it to share it.

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:24.789
The end of a Gilead school for our class

00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:27.150
is the close of a chapter.

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:31.630
And we are determined to write the next chapter of our story

00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:37.190
by showing the same love and personal interest we have experienced.

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:42.029
It is our prayer that as we apply what we have been taught,

00:31:42.029 --> 00:31:47.349
we inspire others and make Jehovah's arts rejoice.

00:31:47.349 --> 00:31:51.430
As the Psalmist expressed as Psalm 10648,

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:57.109
made Jehovah be praised throughout all eternity, praise Ja.

00:31:57.109 --> 00:32:11.380
Your brothers and sisters, the 151st class of Gilead.

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:14.339
Thank you for that beautiful letter.

00:32:14.339 --> 00:32:19.980
And those heartfelt expressions are something we will remember too.

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:22.819
Well, in closing, we just have a few things to say for you now.

00:32:22.819 --> 00:32:25.019
You are graduates.

00:32:25.019 --> 00:32:28.420
Graduates of the 151st class of Gilead.

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:30.660
I used the word students a few times earlier on

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:32.619
because you didn't have the plumber in hand yet.

00:32:32.619 --> 00:32:34.380
Now you have them.

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:38.700
And that's just such an encouraging and wonderful thing to see.

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:42.140
You may know that back in 2011, the governing body

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:46.619
adjusted the objective of Gilead school training a bit.

00:32:46.619 --> 00:32:49.819
Now the training is even more focused on strengthening

00:32:49.819 --> 00:32:54.579
and stabilizing the field and branch organization.

00:32:54.579 --> 00:32:56.420
Since that time, a good number of graduates

00:32:56.420 --> 00:33:00.700
have been appointed to a branch or a country committee.

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:04.859
And so with Jehovah's blessing, the training is working.

00:33:04.859 --> 00:33:08.779
But not all graduates from Gilead are brothers who may

00:33:08.779 --> 00:33:12.140
someday receive such responsibilities.

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:15.660
We have many sisters in each class too, don't we?

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:17.980
So then how might the goal of strengthening

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:21.420
and stabilizing the field and branch organization

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:23.779
be reached through each one of you

00:33:23.779 --> 00:33:27.420
graduating brothers and sisters?

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:31.900
Well, the goal is reached when others can look at what you do and say.

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:36.420
And they see a man or woman of strong faith.

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:40.140
Just as Paul wrote at 1 Thessalonians 1-8,

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:43.579
where he said in part, not only has the word of God

00:33:43.579 --> 00:33:47.460
sounded out from you, but your faith in God

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:51.059
has spread abroad in every place.

00:33:51.059 --> 00:33:54.059
And that's exactly what happens, isn't it?

00:33:54.059 --> 00:33:57.099
Yes, such examples are priceless.

00:33:57.099 --> 00:33:59.900
Your schooling was designed to strengthen your faith

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:02.380
and were confident that it is done just that.

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:05.220
You are ready for what is ahead.

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:07.259
Our faith keeps us strong, though.

00:34:07.259 --> 00:34:10.179
And at 1 John 5-4, the Apostle John wrote,

00:34:10.179 --> 00:34:17.179
this is the conquest that has conquered the world, our faith, right?

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:19.579
With that in mind, for just a few minutes,

00:34:19.579 --> 00:34:23.059
let's consider how you can keep your faith strong

00:34:23.059 --> 00:34:24.460
when you get to your assignments.

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:28.860
And then you can be that powerful force for good

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:33.380
in strengthening and stabilizing the field and branch organization.

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:35.340
So when you're settled into your assignments,

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:38.340
perhaps with new responsibilities,

00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:41.820
remember to remain focused on what is most important,

00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:44.340
namely the doing of God's will.

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:49.380
What could cause a person to forget this, if not careful?

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:51.340
Well, we get into danger.

00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:56.219
If we ever start to feel like we have achieved everything

00:34:56.219 --> 00:35:00.179
that we've wanted to achieve as our spiritual goals.

00:35:00.179 --> 00:35:03.619
See, if we allow that to happen, our interests

00:35:03.619 --> 00:35:05.300
could turn to other things.

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.019
We never want to allow that to happen.

00:35:07.019 --> 00:35:09.860
We want to remain focused on Jehovah, his work.

00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:15.139
It's always about Jehovah and helping other people.

00:35:15.139 --> 00:35:18.780
Never become distracted by losing sight of the need

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:21.659
to keep advancing spiritually day by day.

00:35:21.659 --> 00:35:24.739
Never become content with what this empty system of things

00:35:24.739 --> 00:35:25.900
has to offer.

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:27.900
Remain fixed on Jehovah's promises

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:29.900
and on the doing of his will.

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:35.139
Keep your large shield of faith strong.

00:35:35.139 --> 00:35:37.500
In Bible time, soldiers repaired their shields

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:39.940
between battles.

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:43.019
If a soldier found damage or weakness to his shield,

00:35:43.019 --> 00:35:46.420
he diligently made the needed repairs.

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:50.059
In this way, he was always ready to fight the next battle.

00:35:50.059 --> 00:35:52.420
He never let down his guard.

00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:54.980
We need to keep this up in a spiritual way.

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:57.699
Over time, a brother or sister might lay down

00:35:57.699 --> 00:36:01.019
his or her shield of faith and go after things

00:36:01.019 --> 00:36:03.099
that have no lasting value.

00:36:03.099 --> 00:36:06.420
The devil wants nothing more than to see us

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:10.420
and neglect our faith, because that will pull everything down

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:12.460
if he can do that.

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:15.380
We show that we're strengthening our faith in God

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:20.099
when we take time to give attention to our spiritual need.

00:36:20.099 --> 00:36:22.059
The basics always count.

00:36:22.059 --> 00:36:24.579
The basics always count.

00:36:24.579 --> 00:36:28.219
So then be certain to regularly attend Christian meetings,

00:36:28.219 --> 00:36:31.860
which we know you'll do and soon in person, right?

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:34.659
To zealously speak to others about Jehovah's name

00:36:34.659 --> 00:36:37.539
and his kingdom, to maintain strong faith

00:36:37.539 --> 00:36:40.380
by reading God's word every day,

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:43.300
and then to apply its counsel prayerfully

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:45.619
and all that you do.

00:36:45.619 --> 00:36:48.300
Those are the basics that never fail us

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:51.059
and help us to keep our faith strong.

00:36:51.059 --> 00:36:54.260
So in summary, don't take liberties with your spiritual routine

00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:57.420
how that you've graduated from this wonderful, beautiful school.

00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:59.659
Never neglect those basic things.

00:36:59.659 --> 00:37:04.340
Never become self-satisfied because of resting on a privilege

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:07.260
that you may come to enjoy.

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:10.420
And finally, keep growing as a godly person

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:14.380
because you remember how kind Jehovah has been to you

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:16.219
and to all of us.

00:37:16.219 --> 00:37:18.940
Be like the diligent soldier who worked hard

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:22.900
to care for that shield and all of his vital armor.

00:37:24.019 --> 00:37:26.340
As you remain focused on what Gilead's school

00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:28.900
has now strengthened you to do,

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:33.900
you will always be ready to fight the fine fight of the faith.

00:37:34.179 --> 00:37:36.900
As mentioned earlier, we have confidence

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:39.059
that you will do just that.

00:37:39.099 --> 00:37:42.500
May Jehovah and his dear son bless you,

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:44.019
each one of you for it.
