WEBVTT

00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.700
We stopped and think about the scripture text for today was taken from an article that dealt with how to help

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:12.820
couples who are perhaps having difficulties in their marriage to resolve them and to move forward and

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.419
We contrast that with the the world

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:20.579
You know the world when they before they get married they anticipate they're going to have problems and conflicts and

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.620
They've already mapped a route for

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.820
Leaving the marriage if things are too inconvenient for them or it's just not working for them and

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:33.140
And that's really because they don't know our God Jehovah do they?

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:41.820
They don't know how he feels and the depth of his feelings and when we stop and consider marriage and the institution of marriage that he

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:46.619
inaugurated back in the Garden of Eden. We see a great contrast

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.939
He did not want marriage just to be a contractual agreement something for

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.100
convenience or

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.380
personal interests or even just for procreation purposes

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:04.260
He didn't want it to be a heavy burden for instance that genesis to 24 when Jehovah did perform the first marriage

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:11.980
He didn't say that is why a man will leave his father and mother and they will be stuck with each other for the rest of their lives

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:16.180
as if committing them to a life sentence or a punishment

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.739
No, but when we read Jehovah's words on this in this scripture

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:27.459
We we hear in Jehovah a great deal of affection and even sentiment

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:30.099
about the couple Adam and Eve

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:37.780
When he says that is why a man will leave his father and mother and he will stick to his wife and

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.659
They will become one flesh

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:50.379
You see in this we learn about Jehovah as truly love being his dominant quality and how he convey that dominant quality

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.659
into his earthly

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.780
Creation humans made in his image

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:04.500
Adam and Eve had the capacity then of developing such a love for one another that they would literally cling to one another hold on to one another

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.419
And this is an important aspect of marriage

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.020
Especially as imperfect people living in the time of the end

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:15.860
We have to cling to one another in order to get through the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.139
The tribulations of the flesh and other difficulties that come in on married people today

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:28.500
But we see though in analyzing this we get to know our God Jehovah and

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.300
The deep love that he himself has and conveys to his people

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:43.300
Jehovah is a superlative example of a man if you will a person who clung to his

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.180
wife and why do we say that?

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.939
Consider how he viewed ancient Israel open your Bibles, please to the book of Isaiah and

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:54.939
chapter 54 and verse 5

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.419
Here we read for your grand maker is as your husband

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:05.860
Jehovah of armies is his name

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.259
Now true we think of the covenant that Jehovah

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:18.620
Initiated with the his ancient people Israel. They they were bound together in a covenant agreement, but what was behind it?

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.110
It was love

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.349
Jehovah made that clear to his people

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:33.229
When the this contract this covenant was inaugurated at Deuteronomy chapter 7 and

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:35.789
Verses 7 and 8

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:49.469
Notice what Jehovah through Moses said says it was not because you were the most numerous of all the people's that Jehovah showed affection for you and

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.710
chose you

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.710
You were the smallest of all the peoples

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.990
Rather it was because of Jehovah's love for you

00:03:59.789 --> 00:04:03.789
And because he kept the oath that he sworn to his forefathers

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:16.990
Love was behind this love is what motivated Jehovah to make a covenant with Abraham and pass that on to Isaac Jacob and to other faithful men like David later on

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:21.149
It was love that moved him to engage this covenant

00:04:22.149 --> 00:04:29.870
He found someone that was of the same mind and heart as him who could he who he could use to work out his purpose on

00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:32.269
behalf of mankind

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.069
Jehovah gave them his very best

00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:39.149
He clung to him

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.550
looked after them

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:45.949
And how deeply it pained him when his

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.990
covenant people

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:51.069
wife if you will

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.949
Turned unfaithful to him rejected him

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:01.389
Jehovah's feelings are pure and deep and so Jehovah felt truly betrayed

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.189
And deeply cut to the heart

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.790
Now he really wanted to make this clear to his people

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:16.110
Especially the 10 tribe kingdom who were so spiritually bankrupt that they lost total sense of what Jehovah was all about

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:19.949
So before he pronounced judgment upon them

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:25.870
He made very clear to them just how he felt about them and what they had done to him and how did he do that?

00:05:26.829 --> 00:05:29.470
He commissioned his prophet Hosea to

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.589
With a very difficult assignment

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.310
Turn with me please to the book of Hosea

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:38.189
and chapter 1

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:43.709
I notice what right away what Hosea was to do chapter 1 and verse 2

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:48.269
He says when Jehovah started to speak with his speakers word through Hosea

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:51.149
Jehovah said to Hosea

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:56.269
Go marry a woman of prostitution and have children of prostitution

00:05:56.829 --> 00:06:01.629
Because by prostitution the land has turned completely away from following Jehovah

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.110
Can you imagine getting that assignment

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.230
Here you are a virgin

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:13.069
Never been married before and you're told now to go marry someone that you know is going to be unfaithful to you

00:06:14.269 --> 00:06:16.269
And Jehovah did that

00:06:16.269 --> 00:06:21.550
He wanted to show in a very real way to this hardhearted people

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:27.790
Just what his feelings were and what he was going through in dealing with them

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:38.209
This was a drama not of actors but a real life people that we can just imagine those in the village of Hosea what they were thinking

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:41.490
Here this prophet of God and here this woman was just

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.730
Cheating on him and treating him very very badly

00:06:46.209 --> 00:06:49.170
Anybody with any kind of spiritual sense would have been cut to the heart

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.610
And Jehovah he reached out to those who were cut to the heart because he says

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:59.490
You're going to be this land is going to be destroyed you're going to be off and as exiles

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:03.410
But I'm going to call you back and Hosea 3 1 says

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:08.050
Then Jehovah said to me go once again love the woman who is loved by another man

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:12.370
And it's committing adultery just as Jehovah loves the people of Israel

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.050
While they turn to other gods and low raising cakes

00:07:16.529 --> 00:07:18.529
Jehovah loved them

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:27.089
And those that loved him after exile returned and then they went back to Jerusalem to continue worshiping God there

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:36.290
Certainly when we consider the history of Israel they we feel or know that Jehovah had definitely a legal right to just do away with them

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.170
But he didn't

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:42.610
Why because there were things to be considered

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:47.649
There was a great deal riding on this relationship

00:07:48.129 --> 00:07:55.810
He was working out his purpose on behalf of mankind the Messiah was going to come through this nation and so despite

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:02.850
All the immorality that the people of Israel committed by going to the nations and worshiping bails and whatnot

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:09.970
All this unfaithfulness Jehovah says I'm going to take her back and continue working with her

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:13.250
However

00:08:13.329 --> 00:08:14.930
There there was a limit to this

00:08:16.449 --> 00:08:21.250
And when Jesus came to the earth we know that Jehovah had reached his limit with his people

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:28.769
Especially when they put his only begotten son to death and we can see the remorse that the pain of heart that Jehovah had

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:35.250
Perfectly reflected in Jesus at Luke chapter 19 verses 41 and 42

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:42.529
Here it says when Jesus that is when when he got near nearby that is to Jerusalem. He viewed the city and

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.090
Wept over it saying

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:50.929
If you even you had discerned on this day the things having to do with peace

00:08:52.129 --> 00:08:56.850
But now they have been hidden from your eyes. It was too late too far gone

00:08:57.809 --> 00:09:03.409
The relationship the marriage was going to come to an end and it hurt deeply

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:11.950
You see an understanding the marriage relationship and how Jehovah uses this relationship in a very real way

00:09:12.269 --> 00:09:17.549
We can understand Jehovah better. We get to know how deeply he feels

00:09:18.429 --> 00:09:20.429
about mankind

00:09:20.909 --> 00:09:22.909
How he treasures mankind

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:28.029
But also how he treasures his purpose and wanting to help people

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:31.789
He feels for those who are going through tribulation in the flesh

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:37.389
And especially he feels deeply for those whose mate have proven unfaithful

00:09:38.029 --> 00:09:41.470
Jehovah knows completely the emotions the gamut of emotions

00:09:42.029 --> 00:09:51.070
That such ones go through and he is there to help and to help them work through this and making appropriate decisions that are good for them

00:09:52.669 --> 00:09:58.110
Oftentimes with such ones we see how Jehovah has blessed them with new assignments and yes

00:09:58.669 --> 00:10:04.190
Even a new mate that loves Jehovah and they're often faithfully serving their God together

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:06.990
easing their pain

00:10:07.309 --> 00:10:14.669
So by imitating God's love cultivating God's love in our marriages and understanding marriage we understand Jehovah better

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:22.990
He does not want any of us to view marriage or any assignment as something that is a life sentence or a drudgery a burden

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:25.070
But no

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:30.029
Through love we are able to cultivate marriages and have a life

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:35.230
Whatever situation we may in that will truly bring us joy and happiness
