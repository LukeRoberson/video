00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:10.119
There was a time in my life when I dealt with depression and anxiety.

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:15.160
All I kept thinking was, I'm never going to make it past 20, basically.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:22.750
My congregation's territory is, you know, more apathetic and at the same time mostly commercial,

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.550
so it's definitely challenging. I sometimes thought to myself, seriously, they're again.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.589
It kind of felt like we were just checking things off a list.

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:37.390
I looked to the Catholic Church for help and found absolutely no answer there.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.429
So much so that the phrase that most affected me from the day my grandfather died was,

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:58.299
it was God's will. I was like, what did I do? What? Why is this happening?

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:03.579
In my mind, I was being punished. This was incredibly painful for me.

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:07.099
I just wanted to do something to make the pain go away.

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.540
One day in business went missing, I met a woman who showed some interest,

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.060
so I decided to go back and we ended up studying the Bible for some time.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.299
During that time, my mom, who owns a shop, had accepted a Bible study.

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.739
So I would stay there to listen and learn, and that study started really affecting me,

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:36.590
instead of her. Every time I showed up, it was actually the woman's daughter who was there.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.950
So I would always greet her and I tried to get to know her better.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.349
So we decided to offer her a Bible study, and to my surprise, she accepted. She decided to study.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.739
The thought I had before that I wouldn't live past 20 completely changed.

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:03.900
What made all the difference for me was hearing about the hope of the resurrection.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:11.259
At that time, I thought I had no future, so that hope opened my eyes to a completely new way to live.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.460
You know, she changed her emotional state and her life.

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.699
So for me, it was a huge privilege. It made me so happy.

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:25.740
I felt like the angels had used me to reach her, which is incredible because really we're nothing.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.699
It makes me so happy to see someone that I had a small part in helping become one of Jehovah's

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:44.050
servants. I learned that any territory can be productive. I just need to keep digging.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.610
And if I dig a little deeper, who knows, I might just find what Jehovah's looking for.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.370
I love Jehovah for not at any point giving up on me.
