00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:07.259
In order to feed our hardworking Bethel families throughout the world, thousands of meals are prepared each day.

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.259
Needless to say, much work goes into this food preparation.

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:15.259
But this isn't the only food being prepared at Bethel.

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:21.260
There is a banquet of rich dishes and fine wine that we call spiritual food.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:28.260
The real source of such food is Jehovah, because it is based solidly on his inspired word.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.259
But how do we show our appreciation for this food? Let's find out.

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:39.259
Let's open our Bibles now to Proverbs chapter 2 and we are going to read verses 1 through 4.

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:42.259
Proverbs 2, 1 through 4.

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:52.259
My Son, if you accept my sayings and treasure up my commandments by making your ear attentive to wisdom

00:00:52.259 --> 00:01:01.259
and inclining your heart to discernment. Moreover, if you call out for understanding and raise your voice for discernment,

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:13.260
if you keep seeking for it as for silver and you keep searching for it as for hidden treasures, notice that Jehovah does not force feed us spiritual food.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
But he appeals to our free will.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:27.260
If we show Jehovah we are eager to receive his teachings, if we put forth the effort, if we keep seeking and searching, consider the reward.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:35.260
We receive the key to unlock the hidden treasures and find the knowledge of God.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:44.260
But if we are to find the knowledge of God and to grow spiritually and become mature Christians, we must know how to study.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:52.260
Therefore, in this program we are going to share five ways to help us get the most out of our study.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:59.260
Now the first point is in verse 1. Proverbs chapter 2 and verse 1.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.260
My Son, if you accept my sayings.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:14.259
Now the majority of our viewers agree with us when we say that the Bible is no ordinary book, we accept it as it is, the Word of God.

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:25.259
Now we may say we accept the Bible's teachings, but does our life show that we accept it? Do we allow it to shape and mold our lives?

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:28.259
Much depends on our attitude.

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:38.259
Our attitude toward accepting and applying the Word of God is like a valve. It can either impede or increase the flow of Holy Spirit.

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:48.259
During your study periods, open that valve wide, allow the Bible into your life. Then God's Word can affect you profoundly.

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:54.259
You will see changes in your life that only the power of the Bible truth can bring about.

00:02:54.259 --> 00:03:06.259
Think about how accepting Jehovah's ways is saving you from a bad course as stated at Proverbs chapter 2 and verse 11 and 12.

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:12.259
Let's illustrate how this works when we do our Bible reading.

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:17.259
Open your Bible to Deuteronomy chapter 17 and verse 16.

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:28.259
Now we're going to use this verse to make all five points come alive. Now try to picture yourself in this verse.

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:40.960
You are a king over the nation of Israel. You are surrounded by powerful nations. Let's read the verse, verse 16, Deuteronomy 17.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:53.960
However, he, now that's you, should not acquire many horses for himself or make the people go back to Egypt in order to obtain more horses.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:02.960
Few horses for the king. That means no calvary in the battlefield to a war strategist that might have sounded like terrible advice.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.960
Horses were mighty weapons of war. This is where thinking ability comes in.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:17.959
How will obeying this command save the nation from a bad course? Would you accept this as the word of God?

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.959
You would if you applied our second point as mentioned in Proverbs chapter 2 1b.

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:32.959
Now it says Proverbs chapter 2 1b and treasure up my commandments.

00:04:33.959 --> 00:04:39.959
Now millions believe the Bible is God's word, but they don't treasure it. What makes us different?

00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:47.959
We realize that every word from Jehovah is of value. We see the positive results when we apply what we learn.

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:51.959
As Proverbs chapter 2 and verse 10 states,

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:57.959
When wisdom enters your heart and knowledge becomes pleasant to your soul.

00:04:57.959 --> 00:05:08.959
Wisdom enters our heart and motivates us when you treasure God's precious sayings and experience the beneficial effect they have on you personally.

00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:17.959
Then you become more convinced of the rightness of Jehovah's way of doing things. His sayings really are something to treasure.

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:23.959
So what treasure can we glean from Deuteronomy 1716?

00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:31.959
No horses, no cavalry? When they obeyed that command Israel had no national chariot force.

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:38.959
But what did they have? They had victory after victory. They defeated 31 Canaanite nations greater than them.

00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:45.959
They took control of the promised land. They received the fulfillment of God's promises without a chariot force.

00:05:45.959 --> 00:05:48.959
Do you see the treasure in that?

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:53.959
The third point we want to discuss is in verse 2 which says,

00:05:53.959 --> 00:06:00.300
By making your ear attentive to wisdom.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.300
We want to make our ear attentive to wisdom. How do we do that?

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.300
After reading God's word, listen.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.300
Listen by looking for life application principles.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:18.300
Faith involves more than just reading a statement. It results in action.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:30.540
So as you meditate on God's word, try to single out specific lessons and ask yourself, how can I apply this?

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:35.540
Let's go back to our example of Deuteronomy 1716.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.540
Solomon read Deuteronomy 1716, but did he really listen?

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:47.540
No, he multiplied horses. In fact, he built whole cities to house and support his chariot forces.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:54.540
Now what about us? How are we doing? Are we just reading or are we listening?

00:06:54.540 --> 00:07:03.540
In other words, we may ask ourselves, what action in my life would indicate to Jehovah that I am trusting him more fully?

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.540
Is my ear attentive?

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:13.540
Solomon was one of the wisest men who ever lived. He wrote the words we've been discussing in Proverbs chapter 2.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:21.540
So why didn't he apply them? Why didn't he make his ear attentive to Jehovah's directive in Deuteronomy?

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:28.540
Why did he accumulate horses? Because he did not apply point 4.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:39.540
You recall Proverbs chapter 2 to B. It says, and inclining your heart to discernment.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:54.540
Later in life, the problem was not Solomon's reading ability. He was a smart man, but his heart deep down, it seems he thought his way was better as we make our ear attentive.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:08:03.540
We will find things we need to change. Studying with the goal of making personal application will challenge us to our core.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:19.759
When we discover we are not doing things Jehovah's way, will our heart move us to discern Jehovah's will before starting each study session?

00:08:19.759 --> 00:08:27.759
We must ask him to incline our heart to see what is needed to give us the strength to do things his way.

00:08:28.759 --> 00:08:38.759
For example, ask yourself, if I had been Solomon, would I have acted in harmony with what is stated at Deuteronomy 1716?

00:08:38.759 --> 00:08:49.759
If you are not inclined to agree, would your heart or your feelings move you to discern if there was a deeper reason for Jehovah to set this regulation?

00:08:50.759 --> 00:09:04.759
Search your heart now. Do you honestly believe Jehovah would require something that would put his people in danger? Will you incline your heart to seek the lesson behind his requirement?

00:09:04.759 --> 00:09:17.759
For example, let's go back to the prohibition of Deuteronomy 1716. Think of David, Solomon's father, when facing an ammonite and Syrian army of 32,000 chariots.

00:09:17.759 --> 00:09:27.759
Did it make any sense for David not to have a cavalry of his own? Imagine now that you are a foot soldier in the Israelite army.

00:09:27.759 --> 00:09:37.759
All you have is a sword and a shield. Would you have questioned the king's decision? Would you discern that this really was best for the nation?

00:09:37.759 --> 00:09:47.759
Yes, because you accepted God's word. You treasured it up. You made your ear attentive. You incline your heart. You follow through. That's why you are there.

00:09:47.759 --> 00:10:01.759
Imagine, as you draw up in the battle formation against such a formidable enemy. You see the horses, nostrils, flaring. You can taste the dust kicked up by the 32,000 chariots. You hear the war cry of these mighty warriors. How do you feel?

00:10:01.759 --> 00:10:25.759
Are you nervous? The account recorded at 1 Chronicles 19 says that against all odds, the enemies turned around and fled. The lesson, despite any human tendency to doubt or rationalize, you clearly see that following Jehovah's way is always the best, this surest way for our protection and prosperity.

00:10:25.759 --> 00:10:49.419
When we experienced Jehovah's saving hand in our lives, and we see how he wants to benefit us, we're hooked. Our hearts are touched, and we want more of that in our lives. We've seen the value of these precious truths that makes us look forward to our study. We can't wait to keep digging.

00:10:49.419 --> 00:11:11.090
Let's read verse 4, and highlight our fifth point. If you keep seeking for it as for silver, and you keep searching for it as for hidden treasures, when we seek and search for more details, we find the key to unlock hidden treasures.

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:28.090
For example, let us seek more details on Deuteronomy 1716. Was there any practical reason for the Israelites not to employ horses in battle? Pull out our tools, look at our map in the good land brochure.

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:51.090
Israel's largely a hilly country. A cavalry is most effective in flat, open low planes, not on hills and mountains. Might that fact have led some to draw the wrong conclusions about Jehovah's ability to save his people? Digging deeper, using our research publications gives us more details.

00:11:51.090 --> 00:12:00.090
Insight, volume 1, under the heading, chariot, reveals that the enemies of Jehovah tried to lure his people to fight on flat land.

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:16.090
As first kings chapter 20 makes clear, they thought Jehovah is a god of mountains. Really? Jehovah can only fight in the mountains? The great defeat those enemies suffered proved that our Almighty God is also a god of planes.

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:28.830
What was the main reason for victory in the battle? Horses and cavalry, the terrain, or Jehovah? The answer is obvious.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:41.830
Because of your seeking and searching, you have found a treasure most of the world doesn't even know exists. You now understand what Proverbs 25 calls the fear of Jehovah.

00:12:42.830 --> 00:13:00.830
At the conclusion of a study session, thank Jehovah for the treasure of his word. Like a child eager to relate every detail to a parent, tell Jehovah what you learn from your Bible study. Ask him to help you apply his teachings in your life.

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:11.830
Use our five points from Proverbs 2 to help build an appetite for the banquet of rich dishes and fine wine our Father has lovingly provided.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:25.830
Let's review. 1. First, we want to accept God's Word. Adjust the valve of our attitude and allow Jehovah's precious thoughts to mold and shape our life.

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:36.830
2. We treasure up Jehovah's sayings. We do this when we acknowledge the beneficial effect God sayings have on us personally.

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:48.830
3. We discuss the importance of making our ear attentive. This happens when we sing aloud specific lessons and act to apply them in our life.

00:13:49.830 --> 00:14:04.830
Our fourth point emphasized the need to incline our hearts toward discernment. We do this by begging Jehovah to give us the strength to do things his way and to live in a way that makes his heart rejoice.

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:15.830
Our fifth point encouraged us to keep seeking and searching by digging deeper using our research publications to glean even more details.

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:25.830
These are just a few ways to enhance our appreciation for spiritual food. Now is the time to deepen our knowledge and fortify our faith.

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:33.830
May we heed Jesus' counsel to work for the food that is spiritual food that remains forever lasting life.
