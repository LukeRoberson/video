00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.700
My family are Hungarian Jews.

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.400
Most of them were killed in concentration camps.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.199
That's something that the Holocaust took from me.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.739
They took the concept of family.

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:20.039
I needed explanations.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.339
I needed to know why my family was murdered.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.440
It made me really search at a very young age to see

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.719
if there was a real religion out there.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.520
It was just a secular thing to be Jewish.

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:37.560
It was a cultural thing.

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:40.859
A friend of mine came up to me and said,

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.560
I have to tell you something.

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:47.359
I got this book from one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.000
It is the most beautiful book I have ever read.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.200
I said, oh, I'll beat it.

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:56.200
And it couldn't have been a week later

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:58.439
that I got an knock on my door.

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:02.079
And there were two young women at the door

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:05.879
who started to talk to me about the Bible.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.680
One side started having a study on a regular basis with Carolyn.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.120
I enjoyed it more and more.

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:16.420
One day, my father was home.

00:01:16.519 --> 00:01:20.959
He just screamed at them and basically threw them out of the house.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.659
It just progressed after that.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.299
There was just no peace at any time.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.400
And lots of tears.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.439
And I just couldn't understand why they weren't even asking me,

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.939
what is it that you like about this religion?

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.140
Who are these people?

00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:39.840
Let us talk to no, nothing.

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:43.079
It was very, very hard.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.379
Shortly after my baptism, my mother came up to me

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.280
and she said, your father and I are going out for the day.

00:01:51.379 --> 00:01:54.859
You better not be here when we get home.

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:56.700
I was 17 years old.

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.400
I didn't know where I was going to go.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.900
I didn't know what I was going to do.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.939
But I trusted in Jehovah, and I picked up the phone

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.000
and I called my Carolyn.

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:09.840
In what seemed like minutes, there were brothers and sisters

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:13.180
at the house, they were putting my things into this truck,

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.280
bringing it over to Carolyn's house.

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:19.500
And she said, you can live with me.

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.699
Before I was baptized, I would drive back and forth

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.340
to school with a friend of mine.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.479
Little by little, I was telling him what I was learning.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.979
He said, you know, I want to meet these people.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.879
I have some questions.

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:33.879
I had questions.

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:37.580
I asked them why we died, why we grew old, so forth, and so on.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.919
And they went right to the Bible.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.419
And when I left the house after that,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.219
I said, this is the truth.

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.960
Growing up in my house, going to church every Sunday

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.759
was something that you had to do.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.960
But when I became a teenager, then religion

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.360
became less in my life, and basketball became more.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.259
Being a young man, you watch sports,

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.060
and you see the sports players made a lot of money.

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:03.699
My teachers would tell my parents

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.300
that he's going to be a good basketball player, take care of him.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.039
He could be worth, you know, several hundred thousand dollars

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:11.340
by the time he graduates.

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:15.280
I received over 125 scholarships.

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.479
Now you're talking about a free education,

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.379
just because you can play basketball.

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:22.580
So I realized, you know, in the early age

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.719
that playing professional basketball

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.120
could mean a lot, not only for me, but for my family.

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:33.120
So as far as God was concerned, I had a little interesting God.

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:35.460
Like, I would ask my mom questions.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.659
But it wasn't until Nancy brought me to the witnesses

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:41.599
that really something just kicked in.

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:45.199
I was studying, and my mom, she was downstairs in the basement.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.400
I heard her crying and said, what's wrong?

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.699
And she said, I know you're going to become one of those Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.639
So realizing, in my mind, that I'm not going to become a basketball player,

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.439
I'm going to become one of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:59.639
because that's more important.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.580
That affected me many, many times.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.379
When others found out that I was going to become one of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:09.680
people shied away.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.280
People tried to use you, and they think you can give them something

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:14.080
or you're going to be somebody big

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.920
to go to the direction of serving Jehovah completely.

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.519
You lost all the worldly people that you thought were your friends.

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:27.060
And so that was in one summer, I started the study with Brother Crestbull.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.600
And in six months, I was baptized.

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:33.899
And then we decided to get married.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.500
The scripture that says that even if my own father and my mother would abandon me,

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:46.939
that even Jehovah would take me in, it proved to be true in so many ways.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.180
Once you become one of Jehovah's Witnesses, you're part of a family

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.480
that will do anything for you.

00:04:52.579 --> 00:04:57.160
We've had adversity over the years, but Jehovah never said everything is going to be perfect.

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:02.660
What he said is, when you face these problems, you will not face them alone.

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:05.959
And Jehovah has never let us down when it comes to that.
