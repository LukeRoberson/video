WEBVTT

00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:16.449
We had our own house, a certain amount of comfort, my husband had a stable job, and I was

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:22.329
doing a lot where we were. I had Bible studies, I was already a regular pioneer, so I thought

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:28.820
I was doing enough, it was fine to stay there.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.659
We'd often see the younger ones going to Bethel, going to serve as special pioneers.

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:38.100
And once we reached our 40s, I thought that since we're getting older, we wouldn't be

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.100
able to reach out and do more for Jehovah.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.179
But after a letter was read to the congregations, that was really the starting point for us to

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:49.140
see that we could do more for Jehovah.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.500
When I heard that there was a school for couples up to 65 years old, I said, Christiano, it's

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.979
now or never. So immediately at the first convention that held a meeting for interested couples,

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:04.459
we attended the meeting and realised that out of the requirements there was one that

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:10.019
my husband didn't meet yet, which was two years as a regular pioneer.

00:01:10.019 --> 00:01:16.140
So I thought, why not? After the convention, I applied to be a regular pioneer.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.500
So we made plans to attend the school. But we didn't want to stay there waiting to be

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.620
accepted, as there were no guarantees of being accepted in the same year in which we applied.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.299
We sold our house, and two weeks later we had sold all the furniture.

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:37.390
So we made arrangements to serve where the need was greater.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.750
We took only what was necessary in our car. But what is necessary is always too much when

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.750
you get to the territory. You realise you didn't even need everything you took.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.790
We were really excited because we knew the brothers were expecting us.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.189
There was a gas station that belonged to a brother, and when we arrived, the whole congregation

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.709
was waiting for us there to welcome us.

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:58.709
Nine people.

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:02.829
And that had a great impact on us, because we could see the expression on their faces.

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:10.939
It was if they were asking for help. They helped us a lot.

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:18.830
I can only say that they helped us more than we helped them.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.030
Now they would be able to have regular meetings.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.789
A public talk every week. You know, we were in SÃ£o Paulo, and we had all the meetings.

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:32.310
But in these remote areas, they need spiritual food from Jehovah so much.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.789
But there needs to be people willing to go and help.

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:43.949
Then one day we had a wonderful surprise. A brother called me and said,

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:46.430
Cristiano, have you checked your emails?

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.430
We'd received a letter inviting us to the school.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.550
The school really is a gift from Jehovah.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.710
I've encouraged others I know to attend the school because you really feel how Jehovah cares

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.300
for his organisation.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.659
And a small thing we can do is simply give our best.

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:12.819
And the school helps us to do just that. Find out what is our best.

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.219
We were assigned to a congregation called Iti dos Sur.

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:24.689
The brothers are very loving, and we're really happy in our assignment.

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:31.129
I do miss my house. It's nice to have your own house and not to have to worry about paying rent.

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:34.050
I miss my hairdresser.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:40.500
But nothing compares to the blessings and the joy that comes from serving where there's a need.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:49.050
This joy helps us to combat any home sickness we feel and stops us from developing any desire to go back home.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.889
In the big city everything's very rushed. I would only see my wife when I got home from work.

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:57.449
I'd be tired and then also have to care for congregational matters.

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:00.050
So there wasn't much time for us to be together.

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:05.289
Now it's completely different. We have much more time during the ministry, in the congregation,

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:12.539
being together at home. So for us as a family it's been very positive, very good.

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:17.579
We're not tired. We're not old in the sense of saying that we've got no more to give.

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.579
We really believe we can do more for Jehovah.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.459
And we want to do more for Jehovah.

00:04:23.459 --> 00:04:26.740
The school is proof that he wants us to do more.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.500
We want to use our life to the full to serve Jehovah wherever he sends us.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.220
We're willing to go.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:39.139
We feel it's the only way to say a big thank you to Jehovah for everything he's done for us.

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:44.980
The territory, school, the brothers, and Bible students.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.980
We're better way to thank Jehovah.
