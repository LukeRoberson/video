00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.509
How did we come to Africa?

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:12.509
It was because we went through the Giliad.

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.510
We attended the 47th class of Giliad, and that was in 1969.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.510
Our first assignment was in the Belgian Congo,

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.510
which is now the Democratic Republic of Congo.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.140
When we got our assignment, we were not overjoyed.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:37.140
All we'd heard about the Congo was war, atrocities, mercenaries,

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.140
so we weren't excited.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.140
In fact, Suzanne cried all night.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.140
But we hadn't promised to search over with our whole soul,

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.140
and we have said here we are, sent us.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.140
And so we accepted the assignment.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.140
When we first arrived in the small mining town in Hatanga,

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.140
we were arrested as soon as we got off the plane.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.140
Then there was nobody to meet us.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.140
The telegram, which had been sent three days earlier,

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.140
arrived on the same plane.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.140
The missionaries had all returned to their home countries

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.140
for the international conventions.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.140
So when we eventually arrived at the missionary home,

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.140
it was empty, and they were only big, big cockroaches,

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.140
and bullet holes in the walls.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.140
So we were alone for three weeks until the other mission was arrived.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.140
The next hurdle to overcome was to get used to a complete new culture

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.140
and also to learn two languages.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.140
Communication with our families was also a problem.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.140
There was no internet, no phones.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.140
The only way was by letters.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.140
And it took three weeks, or almost four weeks,

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.140
for a letter to get to our families,

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.140
and another four weeks to get a reply.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.140
Four years, we traveled in the bush,

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.140
doing circuit and district work.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.139
This meant living in the villages, in mudhuts,

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.139
and so we would get water from the river.

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:18.139
Use candles, or our electricity there,

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:22.139
and charcoal to door-cooking on.

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:25.139
We had toilets outside, the home to the ground.

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:27.139
It was real village life.

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:33.889
To get there, we had to travel on roads

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:36.889
that were often almost not existent, or very, very bad.

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:41.889
Rocky, deep sand, muddy, when it was muddy,

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:48.280
it was deep mud, and we could stop.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.280
If we had one ship, we did 2,000 kilometers,

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.280
took us 10 days.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.280
A lot of it was sand, and one day we only went 70 kilometers,

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.280
and we had to dig the vehicle out for all times.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.280
But we got there, with Jehovah's help.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.280
And as far as we were concerned, this was missionary life.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.280
This was real missionary life.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.280
This is what we'd come to do.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.280
We felt closer to Jehovah,

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.280
when we were in the bush, under those difficult circumstances,

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.280
than we ever have.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.280
It was great, we loved it,

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.280
and it's really a big part of our life.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.879
Some ask us if we ever desire to return to Europe,

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:36.879
truthfully, yes, but only very momentarily.

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:39.879
The work was under banned for 10 years.

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:41.879
Carry on a religion that was banned,

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:46.879
was a prison sentence of between 5 and 10 years in prison.

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:51.879
And we'd been caught carrying on a religion that was banned.

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:54.879
We were in custody for 18 days.

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.879
Nobody knew we were under arrest,

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:58.879
the branch, or the missionary home,

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:00.879
because we were so deep in the bush,

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:02.879
we were 2,000 kilometers away from the branch.

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:04.879
So it was just us and Jehovah.

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.879
Well, we saw Jehovah's hand.

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:09.879
He heard our prayers,

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:12.879
and he answered us.

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:14.879
For example, we were running out of money,

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.879
and a complete stranger

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:20.879
offered us $200 US.

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:23.879
And that was a lot of money in those days.

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:27.879
The man that handled our broadcast was very inclined.

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:29.879
And he made a new statement.

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:31.879
And at the end, he wrote,

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:34.879
I know of no law that prohibits me

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:36.879
from visiting my Christian brothers.

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:38.879
And with that, he said,

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:40.879
you're free to go.

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:43.879
And what a wonderful feeling it is to be free.

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:47.879
After we had experienced Jehovah's help and support,

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:49.879
how could we be so ungrateful

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:51.879
as to want to leave our assignment?

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:54.879
That is why I said that it was only for a moment

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:57.879
that we wanted to return to Europe.

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:00.879
Another time in a small bush assembly,

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:05.879
there was the threat that it would be stopped by the authorities.

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:07.879
So that the brothers would get spiritual food,

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:09.879
I divided them into two groups.

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:12.879
One group sat outside the assembly arena,

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:14.879
and the other half was inside.

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:16.879
I put on a pair of shorts,

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:20.879
a vest, a hat, sat in a couch chair,

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:21.879
and gave my toe.

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:23.879
So that if any authorities came,

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:24.879
I would say I'm only rehearsing.

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:27.879
Anyway, when the first half of Europe,

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:30.879
the others came in, I gave the talk again.

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:32.879
On the day of the assembly,

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:34.879
the zone commissioner came.

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:37.879
And he said, we couldn't continue until he checked something.

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:39.879
He sent his men around to check

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:41.879
who had not paid the tax.

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:45.879
Because lies had been said about Jehovah's Witnesses

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:47.879
that we don't pay tax.

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:49.879
And he was so surprised

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:51.879
when they came back and said, boss,

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:53.879
everybody's paying.

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:55.879
And so he stood up and said, OK,

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:57.879
you can carry on with your assembly.

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:00.879
We were so grateful to Jehovah for that.

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:07.269
Zambia is a real preaching paradise.

00:06:07.269 --> 00:06:10.269
People are humble, they are God-fearing.

00:06:10.269 --> 00:06:12.269
And with Jehovah's help,

00:06:12.269 --> 00:06:15.269
we have been able to help more than 130 people

00:06:15.269 --> 00:06:17.269
to come to baptism.

00:06:17.269 --> 00:06:20.269
So we are happy in our assignment.

00:06:20.269 --> 00:06:22.269
What began 46 years ago

00:06:22.269 --> 00:06:25.269
with tears and fear of the unknown

00:06:25.269 --> 00:06:28.269
has turned out to be a wonderful blessing,

00:06:28.269 --> 00:06:31.269
full of privileges and joy.

00:06:31.269 --> 00:06:34.269
We've seen firsthand how Jehovah's Care for us.

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:36.269
In fact, it's opened up.

00:06:36.269 --> 00:06:39.269
The floodgates, floodgates of heaven,

00:06:39.269 --> 00:06:42.269
and poured out of blessing.

00:06:42.269 --> 00:06:44.269
As we look back over the years,

00:06:44.269 --> 00:06:46.269
we're absolutely convinced

00:06:46.269 --> 00:06:49.269
that the blessings outweigh the hardships.

00:06:50.269 --> 00:06:52.269
If we had the chance,

00:06:52.269 --> 00:06:54.269
we'd do it all over again.
