00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:04.059
Welcome to our program.

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:07.660
Here are just a few of the things we can look forward to.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.859
Can the lure of fame draw us away from Jehovah?

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:16.359
How does this brother feel about the decisions he made as a young person?

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:22.660
What does his story teach us about how to use our God-given abilities and talents?

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:29.660
Throughout the organization, young brothers and sisters are reaching out to do more in Jehovah's service.

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:35.560
Their spirituality and youthful energy are helping to advance the kingdom work.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:42.759
But how is showing respect for experienced brothers an important part of any theocratic assignment?

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:47.759
We'll also hear from young brothers and sisters from around the world.

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:52.159
Why is their relationship with Jehovah so important to them?

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:57.060
What do they do to build and maintain their spirituality?

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:05.159
And we'll consider even more ways Christian youths are setting a beautiful example for our worldwide brotherhood.

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:30.079
This is JW Broadcasting for December 2016.

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:40.379
During the past five years, over 1.3 million faithful ones have symbolized their dedication to Jehovah by water baptism.

00:01:40.379 --> 00:01:44.379
That's an average of over 700 each day.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:53.280
And among those courageously taking their stand for true worship are thousands of children, teenagers and young adults.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:01.480
Young brothers and sisters, we know it is not always easy to serve Jehovah and live up to your dedication.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.379
Like older ones, you need to be encouraged and strengthened spiritually.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.979
With that in mind, our theme this month is young ones.

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:15.379
Become an example to the faithful ones.

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:21.979
It is based on the inspiring true life story of a young Christian named Timothy.

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:33.180
Before we discuss Timothy's example, did you know that the Bible specifically foretold that many young people would take sides with Jehovah and our time?

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.979
Let's look at this at Psalm 1103.

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:44.280
And as we read it together, note how young ones are having a share in fulfilling this prophecy.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.379
Notice the first part of verse 3, David saying,

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:55.879
Your people will offer themselves willingly on the day of your military force.

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:03.580
According to this prophecy, Jesus, the Messianic King, would have a large army of willing supporters.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:12.180
Since 1914, millions have carefully investigated the facts and chosen to side with Jehovah God and Jesus Christ.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.379
But where do young ones come into this picture?

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.280
The rest of the verse continues.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:28.979
In splendid holiness, from the womb of the dawn, you have your company of young men just like do drops.

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:33.479
Here, the prophecy refers to a company or group of young ones.

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:38.879
They also would study the evidence and support God's kingdom.

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:43.379
How many young people did Jehovah foresee supporting true worship?

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:47.979
We get an idea by the comparison made to do drops.

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:55.379
Have you ever gone outside early in the morning and noticed a light sparkling coating of water on the ground?

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:57.780
That may have been due.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.080
Jehovah designed our atmosphere so that under certain conditions,

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.680
when the temperature cools during the night, a blanket of moisture forms on the ground.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.680
That coating is made up of a multitude of little drops.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.680
Young ones, what does do have to do with you?

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.180
In the Bible, do is connected with blessing and abundance.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.680
Do drops are also refreshing, life-sustaining, and numerous.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:36.579
Now, remember in Psalm 1103, Jehovah was looking ahead to our time and what did he see?

00:04:36.579 --> 00:04:42.879
The September 15, 2002 watched our on page 8 explained it this way.

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:52.579
Just like refreshing do drops, many young men and women cheerfully serve God and assist their fellow worshipers.

00:04:52.579 --> 00:04:59.879
Today, there are so many mature, bright, happy young ones in the Christian congregation

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:04.879
that they are like countless do drops that sparkle in the morning sun.

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:11.579
You faithful children, teenagers, and young adults who have dedicated your life to Jehovah

00:05:11.579 --> 00:05:20.079
or who are working toward that goal are living proof that Jehovah's confidence in young people was never misplaced.

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:25.379
He cherishes you very much and so do we.

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:31.980
Of course, knowing that Jehovah has confidence in us can be very encouraging.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:37.980
But what if doubts or negative thoughts tend to bring us down?

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.079
On occasion, a young witness might wonder,

00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:45.079
does anyone other than Jehovah notice me?

00:05:45.079 --> 00:05:51.579
Does my example really matter to others to address these questions?

00:05:51.579 --> 00:05:55.579
Let's now consider Timothy's example.

00:05:55.579 --> 00:06:02.680
Open your Bible, please, to our theme text at 1 Timothy, chapter 4 and verse 12.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:09.779
When you find it, you might want to bookmark the verse because we want to first understand the setting.

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:13.480
How old was Timothy at this time?

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:19.980
Often, when thinking of Timothy, I picture a teenager or a young man in his early 20s.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.980
And when he first started traveling with Paul, he was about that age.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.779
But several years passed before Paul wrote letters to Timothy.

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:35.279
So by the time first Timothy was written, Timothy was likely in his early 30s.

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:37.379
Now, what do you think?

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:42.079
Was Timothy young or old?

00:06:42.079 --> 00:06:45.379
Some of you younger ones may be thinking to yourselves,

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:49.079
if he was over 30, then he was old.

00:06:49.079 --> 00:06:54.879
But remember, a much older man like Paul would say that Timothy was quite young.

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:58.779
In fact, notice the expression he uses when writing to Timothy.

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:02.879
First Timothy, chapter 4 and verse 12, Paul says,

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:08.480
Never let anyone look down on your youth.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.279
Instead, become an example to the faithful ones.

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:19.279
In speaking, in conduct, in love, in faith, in chasteness.

00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:24.779
Paul called Timothy a youth and urged him to be a good example.

00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:28.879
While Timothy may have been in his early 30s at this time,

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:33.579
remember that he was taught about Jehovah from the time he was a baby

00:07:33.579 --> 00:07:37.180
and he did well in the truth as a young person.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:40.779
In fact, when he was still a teenager or in his early 20s,

00:07:40.779 --> 00:07:44.779
the elders recommended him to serve as a missionary with Paul.

00:07:44.779 --> 00:07:53.980
So in effect, Paul here is urging Timothy to continue to be a good example for others.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.680
What else do we know about Timothy?

00:07:57.779 --> 00:08:01.279
He was not proud or haughty.

00:08:01.279 --> 00:08:05.779
He likely did not view himself as some amazing example.

00:08:05.779 --> 00:08:10.279
I'm sure he never dreamed that one day Christians all over the world

00:08:10.279 --> 00:08:15.379
would study his life in detail so as to imitate his faith.

00:08:15.379 --> 00:08:20.980
Timothy was modest and this despite his privileges.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:25.180
Paul's words may indicate that Timothy was somewhat shy.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:30.879
Like many of us, he may have battled with feelings of self-doubt on occasion.

00:08:30.879 --> 00:08:35.179
Based on this information, let's do something interesting now.

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:39.679
Let's use our imagination to visualize Timothy

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:44.980
an elder in his early 30s coming to give a scriptural talk in the congregation.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:46.480
Got the picture?

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:51.980
In your mind, please look at Timothy and then look at the audience.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.480
Who do we see?

00:08:54.480 --> 00:09:00.580
Many in attendance are old enough to be Timothy's parents or grandparents.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.779
How do you think Timothy felt?

00:09:02.779 --> 00:09:04.779
Super confident?

00:09:04.779 --> 00:09:09.279
Are you visualizing him proudly walking into the meeting place, saying,

00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:13.179
I sure wish my friends back in Listera could see me now.

00:09:13.179 --> 00:09:17.480
Look at the crowds that come to hear me speak.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:22.080
No, that's not the Timothy we know.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.580
It's much more likely that Timothy, like most of us,

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:29.679
rehearsed his presentation over and over again.

00:09:29.679 --> 00:09:36.879
He probably prayed constantly and he probably still got nervous like all of us.

00:09:36.879 --> 00:09:43.480
And remember, Timothy did not have the benefit of theocratic schools like we do today.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:48.480
In summary, what can we say about Timothy?

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:54.679
Like so many of you, he was an example of faith and obedience.

00:09:54.679 --> 00:10:00.980
He was exceptional in displaying Christian qualities such as modesty and humility.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:06.179
But Timothy was a person with normal human feelings like all of us.

00:10:06.179 --> 00:10:09.480
Though he had a rich, happy life in Jehovah's service,

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:13.279
life in the old world brought real tests and challenges.

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:16.779
Timothy also dealt with frequent cases of sickness

00:10:16.779 --> 00:10:19.980
and he was imprisoned for a time.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:26.080
Some of you in various countries can relate to those bitter experiences.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.980
But Timothy endured.

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:33.279
Was he some super Christian with super powers?

00:10:33.279 --> 00:10:38.980
No, but he did prove to be a super example.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.980
How does all of this help you?

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:47.379
Christian youths who have taken the commendable step to dedicate your lives to Jehovah.

00:10:47.379 --> 00:10:52.580
We just read how Paul told Timothy to let no one look down on his youth.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:55.580
A few of you may be thinking,

00:10:55.580 --> 00:11:02.379
I wish someone would tell my parents or my elders not to look down on me.

00:11:02.379 --> 00:11:05.580
They still treat me like a little kid.

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:08.980
If that's the case, we feel for you.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:14.179
No progressive young one wants to be treated as if he were a child.

00:11:14.179 --> 00:11:18.580
But let's look again at 1 Timothy chapter 4 and verse 12.

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:22.080
Is the Apostle Paul speaking to the congregation,

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.580
to parents or to the elders?

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:31.179
Never let anyone look down on your youth.

00:11:31.179 --> 00:11:35.279
Instead, become an example to the faithful ones in speaking,

00:11:35.379 --> 00:11:40.580
in conduct, in love, in faith, in chasteness.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.179
It's clear, isn't it?

00:11:43.179 --> 00:11:45.879
Paul said your youth.

00:11:45.879 --> 00:11:49.080
He was speaking only to Timothy.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:54.379
Young ones, my extension, what is Jehovah saying to each of you?

00:11:54.379 --> 00:11:55.879
It's this.

00:11:55.879 --> 00:11:59.379
To gain and maintain the respect of faithful ones,

00:11:59.379 --> 00:12:04.580
you have to work at proving yourself as a Christian.

00:12:04.679 --> 00:12:08.679
The key is not wanting or hoping that others will respect you.

00:12:08.679 --> 00:12:14.480
Rather, it's earning such respect by setting a good example in all areas of life.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:20.679
If you do that, then no one will have any legitimate reason to look down on your youth.

00:12:20.679 --> 00:12:26.879
Doesn't it make sense that we gain respect by earning it?

00:12:26.879 --> 00:12:31.480
We are confident that you young ones are trying hard to live by Christian principles

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.879
at school and in the neighborhood.

00:12:33.879 --> 00:12:39.480
But in verse 12, did you notice who Timothy was to be an example to?

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.980
To the faithful ones.

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:45.580
Are you an example to Christians, both younger and older,

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:48.679
in your congregation and in your circuit?

00:12:48.679 --> 00:12:52.279
If you work on Kingdom Hall construction projects or a Bethel,

00:12:52.279 --> 00:12:56.379
are you an example to your fellow workers?

00:12:56.379 --> 00:12:58.879
Well, what are some specific ways?

00:12:58.879 --> 00:13:04.080
You can become an example to all of these faithful ones.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:10.480
In our theme text, the Timothy was first directed to become an example in speaking.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:15.980
On this topic, I'll never forget an illustration used in the young people ask article

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:19.279
from the January 2012 awake.

00:13:19.279 --> 00:13:22.279
Equated a young man, James, who said,

00:13:22.279 --> 00:13:27.779
once you squeeze toothpaste out, you can't put it back in the tube.

00:13:27.879 --> 00:13:29.580
The same is true with our words.

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:34.279
Once we say something hurtful, we can't take it back.

00:13:34.279 --> 00:13:37.279
God's word agrees with James.

00:13:37.279 --> 00:13:43.080
Note what it says at Ephesians chapter 4 and verse 29.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.779
It tells us,

00:13:44.779 --> 00:13:48.980
let a rotten word not come out of your mouth,

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:52.379
but only what is good for building up as the need may be

00:13:52.379 --> 00:13:56.879
to impart what is beneficial to the hearer.

00:13:56.879 --> 00:14:00.080
For some years now, those getting baptized have been encouraged

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:04.379
to complete a study of the book, keep yourselves in God's love.

00:14:04.379 --> 00:14:06.080
Chapter 12 is entitled,

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:09.980
speak what is good for building up.

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:13.779
On page 140, there is a box with five questions

00:14:13.779 --> 00:14:18.179
that can help us evaluate our speech, for example.

00:14:18.179 --> 00:14:22.980
When was the last time I offered someone specific commendation?

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.179
Do I express my respect for others by saying,

00:14:26.179 --> 00:14:28.279
please, and thank you?

00:14:28.279 --> 00:14:32.080
In conversation, do I speak mainly about myself

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:36.879
or am I also interested in the thoughts and feelings of others?

00:14:36.879 --> 00:14:39.480
Young ones, over the next few days,

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.480
why not review that box on page 140?

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:47.580
Look up the scriptures and think about what Jehovah is saying.

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.980
Then apply what you learn to your speech.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:54.279
Doing this will draw you closer to Jehovah

00:14:54.279 --> 00:14:57.779
and help you to become an even better example

00:14:57.779 --> 00:15:00.779
to the faithful ones.

00:15:00.779 --> 00:15:03.480
The second area mentioned in our theme text

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:06.679
is becoming an example in conduct.

00:15:06.679 --> 00:15:10.279
Of course, upbuilding speech would be empty

00:15:10.279 --> 00:15:14.679
or hypocritical if our conduct was questionable.

00:15:14.679 --> 00:15:16.879
Think again about Timothy.

00:15:16.879 --> 00:15:19.480
It wasn't enough for him to give comments

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:23.379
and talks at the meetings or preach from door to door.

00:15:23.379 --> 00:15:26.080
Later, in the same letter, Paul reminded Timothy

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.980
that he needed to treat older men and women as fathers

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:32.379
and mothers, younger men and women were to be treated

00:15:32.379 --> 00:15:35.580
as brothers and sisters.

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:38.580
Second Peter, chapter three and verse 11,

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:42.779
provides a similar urge and reminder about our conduct.

00:15:42.779 --> 00:15:44.379
Let's read that together.

00:15:44.379 --> 00:15:48.779
Again, that's second Peter, chapter three and verse 11.

00:15:48.879 --> 00:15:51.080
There it tells us,

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:55.080
since all these things are to be dissolved in this way,

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:57.779
consider what sort of people you ought to be

00:15:57.779 --> 00:16:01.580
in holy acts of conduct.

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:03.580
Let's think about that.

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:08.480
For a person's conduct to be holy from Jehovah's perspective,

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.480
he or she must be morally clean.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.179
While physical cleanness is on the outside,

00:16:14.179 --> 00:16:19.279
moral cleanness is on the inside in our thoughts and desires.

00:16:19.279 --> 00:16:22.580
Is being morally clean really important?

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:24.580
Think about it this way.

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:28.379
When eating a meal, would you be content to eat from a bowl

00:16:28.379 --> 00:16:31.679
that had been washed only on the outside?

00:16:31.679 --> 00:16:33.179
Of course not.

00:16:33.179 --> 00:16:35.179
We want to eat from clean dishes,

00:16:35.179 --> 00:16:38.879
dishes that are thoroughly clean inside and out.

00:16:38.879 --> 00:16:42.179
So when we wash dishes, we wash the outside

00:16:42.279 --> 00:16:44.279
and the inside.

00:16:44.279 --> 00:16:46.879
Similarly, Jehovah expects his servants

00:16:46.879 --> 00:16:50.080
to be clean through and through.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.679
And because Jehovah,

00:16:51.679 --> 00:16:55.080
the perfect reader of hearts will soon dissolve,

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.980
yes, eliminate this dirty system of things,

00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:59.980
it's urgent that we do so.

00:17:01.179 --> 00:17:03.980
This means that we have to work very hard

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:07.380
so that nothing unclean enters our mind.

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:10.980
That means firmly rejecting so-called fun

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:12.579
and exciting entertainment,

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:16.779
which features sex, violence or spiritism.

00:17:16.779 --> 00:17:19.680
At 1 Corinthians 14 and verse 20,

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.579
the Bible tells us that we should become

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:25.680
like young children as to badness.

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.779
No matter our age, we don't need

00:17:28.779 --> 00:17:31.180
and we don't want any experience

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:33.980
with the wickedness of this world.

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:37.279
Rather, we keep the inside of the dish

00:17:37.279 --> 00:17:40.480
our mind and heart clean at all times.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.279
And when we do so,

00:17:42.279 --> 00:17:44.180
our exemplary conduct

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.380
pleases Jehovah and its strengthens

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.180
our faithful brothers and sisters.

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.980
Really, it's the only way to respect ourselves

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.180
and to gain the respect of others.

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:58.079
Our theme text at 1 Timothy chapter 4 and verse 12

00:17:58.079 --> 00:18:00.380
goes on to mention other areas

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.480
where we can make steady progress

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.279
in becoming an example,

00:18:04.279 --> 00:18:05.680
such as in love,

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.680
in faith and in chasteness.

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.779
During your personal study,

00:18:10.779 --> 00:18:12.480
that is your personal time

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.380
with your best friend Jehovah,

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:17.980
why not examine these areas in more detail?

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:20.980
The treasures you gain from such a study project

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:23.380
can last a lifetime

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:26.380
and everlasting lifetime.

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:28.980
So what have we learned?

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:31.180
In fulfillment of Bible prophecy,

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:33.680
a large company of young people

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.980
from around the world

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:38.579
are taking a stand with Jehovah and Jesus.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:41.980
That includes all of you.

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:43.480
Like do drops,

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:45.680
you're not only abundant in number,

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.579
but you sparkle in our congregations.

00:18:48.579 --> 00:18:51.579
Your presence is very refreshing.

00:18:51.579 --> 00:18:53.380
So please,

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:56.579
don't look down on your youth.

00:18:56.579 --> 00:18:59.079
Rather, rejoice in your youth.

00:18:59.079 --> 00:19:03.079
Yes, become an example to the faithful ones.

00:19:04.279 --> 00:19:06.380
In the following dramatization,

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:07.880
a young brother is doing just

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.279
what we've discussed.

00:19:09.279 --> 00:19:12.079
He's becoming an example to faithful ones

00:19:12.079 --> 00:19:15.279
and working hard at the assignments he has given.

00:19:15.279 --> 00:19:18.579
But there's something he lacks,

00:19:18.579 --> 00:19:20.579
a quality that would make him

00:19:20.579 --> 00:19:46.170
even more valuable to Jehovah and to the congregation.

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:47.869
Before the meeting starts,

00:19:47.869 --> 00:19:53.900
I need to get things ready.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:56.200
I'm Ben.

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.700
And as a minister or servant,

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:07.150
I can do a lot to help the congregation.

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:08.450
And that night,

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:12.349
I was given another assignment.

00:20:12.349 --> 00:20:14.150
Brother Richards asked if I could help him

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:16.150
update the territory maps

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:21.109
and organize our schedules for public witnessing.

00:20:21.109 --> 00:20:26.109
I think the brothers know I can modernize all of this.

00:20:26.109 --> 00:20:30.109
Brother Richards said to talk to brother Bello first.

00:20:30.109 --> 00:20:34.470
He was the service overseer for years.

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:35.670
Great idea,

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:42.910
but I can already imagine the possibilities.

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:44.309
By that weekend,

00:20:44.309 --> 00:20:50.519
I had almost finished.

00:20:50.519 --> 00:20:56.740
I couldn't believe the outdated ways our records were kept.

00:20:56.740 --> 00:21:00.740
This is going to be way better for the congregation.

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:09.440
And who knows what else could be improved?

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:13.940
I thought I had everything ready to show brother Richards.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.440
He liked the new ideas.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.140
But then he asked me,

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:22.329
what did brother Bello think?

00:21:22.329 --> 00:21:24.329
Oh, brother Bello,

00:21:24.329 --> 00:21:26.329
I forgot.

00:21:26.329 --> 00:21:27.829
I should have asked him,

00:21:27.829 --> 00:21:29.730
but at this point,

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:33.200
didn't really matter.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:38.089
Brother Richards suggested we read about Elijah.

00:21:38.089 --> 00:21:40.990
When the older Elijah's work was ending,

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:44.190
Elijah start close to his teacher.

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:45.589
Urged to stay behind,

00:21:45.589 --> 00:21:48.089
Elijah repeatedly said,

00:21:48.089 --> 00:21:50.890
as surely as Jehovah is living

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:52.289
and as you are living,

00:21:52.289 --> 00:21:58.819
I will not leave you.

00:21:58.819 --> 00:22:01.220
Until the moment Elijah left,

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:15.549
Elijah wanted to learn from him

00:22:15.549 --> 00:22:18.349
like a son asking his father.

00:22:18.349 --> 00:22:21.450
He wanted a double portion of Elijah's spirit

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:26.529
to continue the work he started.

00:22:26.529 --> 00:22:29.730
And Elijah's first miracle

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:33.829
was the same as Elijah's last.

00:22:33.829 --> 00:22:35.930
Dividing the Jordan

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:39.829
with Elijah's official garment.

00:22:39.829 --> 00:22:41.829
Everything Elijah did

00:22:41.829 --> 00:22:43.730
revealed his respect

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:48.480
for the experienced man Elijah.

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.279
I wasn't finished with my new assignment

00:22:50.279 --> 00:22:54.200
after all.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:59.619
There was a lot I needed to learn from brother Bello.

00:22:59.619 --> 00:23:02.420
He really understood our preaching territory

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:06.630
and the people who lived here.

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:09.230
He liked my ideas.

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:11.529
But everything he showed me

00:23:11.529 --> 00:23:29.230
made them even better.

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:34.730
I can do a lot to help the congregation.

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:38.029
And I pray that Jehovah lets me do even more

00:23:38.029 --> 00:23:40.730
with the gifts he gave me

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:54.789
and with the wisdom of experienced men.

00:23:54.789 --> 00:23:59.190
Ben had good ideas to improve the work he'd been assigned

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:01.589
but he also learned to respect the experience

00:24:01.589 --> 00:24:03.589
of older brothers.

00:24:03.589 --> 00:24:05.589
You too may have ideas

00:24:05.589 --> 00:24:07.089
to benefit your assignment

00:24:07.089 --> 00:24:08.990
whether in the congregation

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:11.890
a Bethel are on a construction project.

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:12.990
Like Ben,

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:16.190
seek the wisdom of experienced brothers and sisters

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:18.690
who did the assignment before you.

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:22.190
Find out why they did things a certain way.

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:24.690
What were the challenges they faced?

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:28.289
What direction and resources influenced their efforts?

00:24:28.289 --> 00:24:31.990
How can their experience help you succeed?

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:34.890
You'll see the wisdom in what may at first

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:37.589
look like outdated methods.

00:24:37.589 --> 00:24:40.690
Speak respectfully of their past work

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:43.089
and you'll reflect how Jehovah

00:24:43.089 --> 00:24:45.390
treasures what they did for him.

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:46.690
Jehovah will intern,

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:49.789
bless the work of your hands.

00:24:49.789 --> 00:24:53.390
What else will bring Jehovah's blessing?

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:57.789
He draws close to spiritually-minded people.

00:24:57.789 --> 00:25:00.089
Young Christians all over the world

00:25:00.089 --> 00:25:02.089
are experiencing the benefits

00:25:02.089 --> 00:25:05.690
of maintaining a close relationship with God.

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:09.190
Each of you faces a unique set of circumstances

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:13.089
that make it difficult to be a spiritually-minded youth.

00:25:13.089 --> 00:25:15.289
So we interviewed young witnesses

00:25:15.289 --> 00:25:16.589
from different lands

00:25:16.589 --> 00:25:18.289
to find out what they do

00:25:18.289 --> 00:25:21.990
to keep growing spiritually.

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:23.190
Our relationship with Jehovah

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:25.490
can start when we're young.

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:26.990
For me, it was the example

00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:29.890
that other set of putting Jehovah first

00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:33.089
and the happiness that came as a result

00:25:33.089 --> 00:25:35.390
as well as being in that sort of environment

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:39.289
that really helped me to one reach out

00:25:39.289 --> 00:25:42.789
as well as be available for those opportunities.

00:25:42.789 --> 00:25:44.390
And once we do give our life to Jehovah,

00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:45.789
it's amazing to see the blessings

00:25:45.789 --> 00:25:48.289
that he has in store for us.

00:25:48.289 --> 00:25:50.490
But in order to build that relationship

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:52.190
we need to read God's Word.

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:53.890
We also need to pray to him.

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:55.490
The more you get to know him,

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:58.089
the more appealing things you learn about him

00:25:58.089 --> 00:26:01.289
that makes you not want to lose him as your friend.

00:26:01.289 --> 00:26:03.589
I always knew it was the truth

00:26:03.589 --> 00:26:06.289
and that I want to serve Jehovah forever,

00:26:06.289 --> 00:26:09.990
but I needed to reassure myself of certain aspects.

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:13.089
So I did some research projects with my parents

00:26:13.089 --> 00:26:14.589
using their creator book

00:26:14.589 --> 00:26:16.890
and some items from the Bible Teachbook.

00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:19.690
After that, it only became more obvious

00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:21.789
and I was certain that I wanted it

00:26:21.789 --> 00:26:23.890
and that I was ready to get baptized.

00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:26.990
To strengthen my relationship with Jehovah,

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:29.890
I read the Bible daily and I pray,

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:32.190
especially when there is no one around,

00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:33.390
or it's quiet,

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:36.589
I talked to Jehovah with all my heart at that time.

00:26:36.589 --> 00:26:39.789
Making myself available for spiritual opportunities

00:26:39.789 --> 00:26:42.089
was a little bit difficult for me at first,

00:26:42.089 --> 00:26:43.690
but I didn't give up.

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:45.190
After my baptism,

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:46.890
I became a ministerial servant

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:49.690
and I also served almost two years in Bethel,

00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:52.690
and now I'm a regular pioneer in how to do

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:56.970
in a current speaking congregation.

00:26:56.970 --> 00:27:00.170
I didn't know or speak the currents of our language,

00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:01.869
so the local brothers helped me to learn

00:27:01.869 --> 00:27:03.470
not only how to speak,

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:08.309
but also how to read.

00:27:08.309 --> 00:27:12.109
Prayers are important to strengthen my relationship with Jehovah.

00:27:12.109 --> 00:27:14.710
For me, it's like talking to a friend

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:16.809
and that's always helpful.

00:27:16.809 --> 00:27:18.410
He's someone real to me

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:20.710
and I fully trust that he listens to me.

00:27:22.109 --> 00:27:25.309
I support the elders by helping with the cleaning of the hall,

00:27:25.309 --> 00:27:26.809
serving as an attendant,

00:27:26.809 --> 00:27:28.710
handling microphones as well,

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:32.210
as helping the congregation spiritually.

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:35.009
When I share Jehovah's promises of eternal life

00:27:35.009 --> 00:27:38.410
with others, I too am encouraged.

00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:41.710
I am constantly remembering what Jehovah promises

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:45.009
and that motivates me to keep preaching.

00:27:45.009 --> 00:27:47.609
There's a family in our congregation

00:27:47.609 --> 00:27:49.509
who took me into their home

00:27:49.509 --> 00:27:57.900
and served as my spiritual parent.

00:27:57.900 --> 00:27:59.799
Through our family worship,

00:27:59.799 --> 00:28:07.589
they helped me to progress spiritually.

00:28:07.589 --> 00:28:09.589
The elderly ones in our congregation

00:28:09.589 --> 00:28:11.789
have been helping me a lot.

00:28:11.789 --> 00:28:14.390
First, they're good examples.

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:17.690
They also remind me to keep my eyes simple.

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:21.390
Despite their limited circumstances because of age,

00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:24.089
they are determined to serve Jehovah God.

00:28:24.089 --> 00:28:27.289
And that made me reflect on my situation.

00:28:27.289 --> 00:28:28.789
I'm very young.

00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:32.890
What prevents me from doing the things that they do?

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:34.289
Before I began Pioneering,

00:28:34.289 --> 00:28:36.890
I used to selfish seven days a week.

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:39.089
But now I selfish four days a week,

00:28:39.089 --> 00:28:43.539
so three days are available for Pioneering.

00:28:43.539 --> 00:28:46.740
To be able to be available for spiritual opportunities,

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:51.680
I closely associate with my congregation.

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.079
I offer some older ones a ride to the meetings

00:28:54.079 --> 00:28:58.609
or in the preaching work.

00:28:58.609 --> 00:28:59.809
The reason I'm doing this

00:28:59.809 --> 00:29:01.710
is because I want to give my youth

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:06.730
and energy to Jehovah God.

00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:07.730
When I was at school,

00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:12.529
I would conduct Bible studies with some of my classmates.

00:29:12.529 --> 00:29:16.529
In time, they join me in serving Jehovah.

00:29:16.529 --> 00:29:18.230
When I think about being with them

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:20.029
in the future of Paradise,

00:29:20.029 --> 00:29:22.930
it gives me deep joy.

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:25.430
I have the privilege of studying with a deaf girl

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:27.730
who leaves two hours from where I live.

00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:29.529
We have to walk all the way.

00:29:29.529 --> 00:29:32.230
She is very happy with what she's learning

00:29:32.329 --> 00:29:34.329
and her family is very supportive.

00:29:34.329 --> 00:29:36.630
So knowing that Jehovah is helping her

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:38.130
and I have a part in it,

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:41.230
it's just priceless.

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:42.930
Exile Pioneering definitely helped me

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:44.730
because it was like a stepping stone

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:47.029
to regular pioneering.

00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:49.430
The ministry definitely gives you the opportunity

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:51.930
to be able to work closely with Jehovah

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:53.230
and then by doing that,

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:54.529
you're reaffirming your faith

00:29:54.529 --> 00:29:56.029
in what you already believe in

00:29:56.029 --> 00:29:59.730
and then you're drawing closer to Jehovah in friendship.

00:29:59.829 --> 00:30:02.829
Having JW.org and the broadcast

00:30:02.829 --> 00:30:06.730
has definitely drawn me closer to our brothers and sisters,

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:09.230
but also Jehovah as well.

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:12.130
Just by nature, I feel like I'm a more of a timid person.

00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:14.730
So going door to door can be a little scary,

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:17.130
but seeing other young ones in different parts of the world

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:20.230
that are enduring very difficult circumstances

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:21.529
and living conditions

00:30:21.529 --> 00:30:24.329
and yet are still giving their best to Jehovah

00:30:24.329 --> 00:30:25.730
is so encouraging for me

00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:27.329
and it helps me to keep going on

00:30:27.329 --> 00:30:28.829
and give Jehovah my best as well.

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:34.930
When I think personally about all the avenues of service

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:38.130
that we can have a hand in today,

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:41.130
there are so many that are exciting

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:44.730
whether it be pioneering in a foreign country,

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:47.930
serving where the need is great,

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:49.829
even serving at Bethel.

00:30:49.829 --> 00:30:52.630
Unless we taste and see that Jehovah is good,

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:54.130
unless we put ourself out there

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:56.829
and are available to try that at least once,

00:30:57.829 --> 00:30:59.930
we'll never know what it would be like

00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:03.130
to really serve Jehovah and in doing that,

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:13.359
you will see how Jehovah does want the best life for us.

00:31:13.359 --> 00:31:15.660
Those young ones and others like them

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:18.859
are developing the same spiritual qualities

00:31:18.859 --> 00:31:21.559
that Paul saw in Timothy.

00:31:21.559 --> 00:31:25.259
Read along with me and see how Paul described Timothy

00:31:25.259 --> 00:31:28.460
at Philippians chapter two, starting at verse 20.

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:33.759
For I have no one else of a disposition like his

00:31:33.759 --> 00:31:36.859
who will genuinely care for your concerns.

00:31:36.859 --> 00:31:39.559
For all the others are seeking their own interests,

00:31:39.559 --> 00:31:41.960
not those of Jesus Christ.

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:44.460
But you know the proof he gave of himself

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:46.559
that like a child with a father,

00:31:46.559 --> 00:31:49.660
he slaved with me to advance the good news.

00:31:50.559 --> 00:31:53.759
What is it that Paul saw in Timothy?

00:31:53.759 --> 00:31:57.859
He saw his spiritual disposition or attitude.

00:31:57.859 --> 00:32:00.759
He observed his genuine interest in his brothers

00:32:00.759 --> 00:32:02.259
and sisters.

00:32:02.259 --> 00:32:05.859
Timothy really desired to do God's will,

00:32:05.859 --> 00:32:09.460
even though others were seeking their personal interests.

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:12.359
And Timothy earned his fellow worshipers respect

00:32:12.359 --> 00:32:14.859
by working with older and more experienced Christians

00:32:14.859 --> 00:32:17.259
like Paul in the ministry.

00:32:17.259 --> 00:32:20.259
When you spiritually minded young ones

00:32:20.259 --> 00:32:24.660
cultivate that beautiful Timothy like disposition

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:28.160
you make Jehovah's heart rejoice.

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:30.859
Of course, putting Kingdom interests first

00:32:30.859 --> 00:32:33.059
and the needs of others ahead of our own

00:32:33.059 --> 00:32:35.559
is not always easy.

00:32:35.559 --> 00:32:38.160
We know there are real temptations

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:41.859
that can lead a young person away from Jehovah.

00:32:41.859 --> 00:32:43.660
When others outside the congregation

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:46.460
recognize our abilities and talents,

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:49.559
we could begin to see great things for ourselves,

00:32:49.559 --> 00:32:52.359
perhaps fame and recognition.

00:32:52.359 --> 00:32:55.460
In this interview, Brother Eduardo Franco

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:58.160
relates how this desire caused him

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:01.359
to turn his back on Jehovah.

00:33:01.359 --> 00:33:06.359
So, if the devil tempted Jesus,

00:33:06.359 --> 00:33:08.859
don't you think he would try to tempt us

00:33:08.859 --> 00:33:13.359
in order to jeopardize our relationship with God?

00:33:13.359 --> 00:33:15.859
This is the best contract we've ever offered you.

00:33:15.859 --> 00:33:17.359
Listen, I'll get you a plan

00:33:17.359 --> 00:33:19.359
so you can attend your religious meetings during the week

00:33:19.359 --> 00:33:26.089
just do the concert for us on the weekend.

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:27.890
People always ask me,

00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:31.589
why did you leave a music world?

00:33:31.589 --> 00:33:33.990
When I was still a boy,

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:38.190
I had dreams about becoming a famous singer.

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:40.289
Then I learned the truth,

00:33:40.289 --> 00:33:44.589
but I never fully removed those dreams from my art.

00:33:44.589 --> 00:33:47.190
And then I started listening to some bad influences

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:49.789
from my past.

00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:51.589
And they got me hooked.

00:33:51.589 --> 00:33:57.339
Then they rolled me into the recording studio.

00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:58.940
The lyrics in the songs,

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:03.339
they really bothered my conscience.

00:34:03.339 --> 00:34:06.039
So they offered me some liquor to loosen me up.

00:34:06.039 --> 00:34:09.340
And then I started to feel more comfortable.

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:12.539
I started singing in the light what they were hearing.

00:34:12.539 --> 00:34:15.739
And those songs ended up all over the radio stations.

00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:18.639
It was as if Satan gave me a trophy

00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:21.639
for abandoning Jehovah.

00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:27.710
I became addicted to the applause.

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:30.110
Everything looks so beautiful.

00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:31.710
But when you're on top,

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:34.610
when you're really at the top of Satan's world,

00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:36.510
there's nothing beautiful there.

00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:38.010
I was an actor.

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:39.710
And when the camera's turned on,

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:42.409
my face and my smile turned on too.

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:44.909
But when I would get back to the hotel,

00:34:44.909 --> 00:34:46.909
it was a huge step down.

00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:49.010
There was no applause.

00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:56.210
Just that silence, that torment in my conscience.

00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:57.610
So basically,

00:34:57.610 --> 00:34:59.909
you had to find other distractions.

00:34:59.909 --> 00:35:02.909
And one of those for me was a saw machine.

00:35:02.909 --> 00:35:07.110
And of course, casinos don't just come with saw machines.

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:11.510
They also expose you to prostitution and alcohol.

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:13.710
My conscience would ask,

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:16.710
what are you doing here?

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:18.710
I remember those times on tour.

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:21.710
For my limousine, I'd see the brothers preaching.

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:23.710
And that would always touch my heart.

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:25.210
I would say to myself,

00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:28.309
wow, Jehovah trained you to be doing that.

00:35:28.309 --> 00:35:30.110
And look at what you're doing.

00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:33.110
That really cut deep into my heart.

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:37.610
The road back to this road was really very hard.

00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:39.710
Every time I was going to retire,

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:41.710
I'd say, this is it.

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:45.510
But then there would always be a bigger contract.

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:48.210
I had to make drastic decisions.

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:49.909
But finally, I said,

00:35:49.909 --> 00:35:52.309
I don't care what they offer me.

00:35:52.309 --> 00:35:54.710
I have to return to Jehovah.

00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:58.909
I have to fulfill the vow I made to him when I was a young man.

00:35:58.909 --> 00:36:01.710
When I dedicated my life to him.

00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:05.010
So I prayed to Jehovah very earnestly and said,

00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:07.710
Jehovah, I need to return to you.

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:10.010
I need to return to your loving arms,

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:13.309
sitting in his ripped and healed way from you.

00:36:13.309 --> 00:36:16.760
He's helped me.

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:20.460
I remember that before I went into that first meeting,

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:21.760
I told Jehovah,

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.960
please give me a sign that you will take me back.

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:27.260
And there was an elderly sister there.

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:30.960
She gave me a great big hug and said,

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.659
welcome back son.

00:36:32.659 --> 00:36:37.659
And she took my hand and set by me during the entire meeting.

00:36:37.659 --> 00:36:40.059
I have betrayed Jehovah.

00:36:40.059 --> 00:36:44.590
But I think,

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:46.789
I think the brothers,

00:36:46.789 --> 00:36:50.789
because Jehovah put brothers at every turn.

00:36:50.789 --> 00:36:53.190
They showed me with the Bible

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:58.090
how far I had straight from the path of the true God.

00:36:58.090 --> 00:37:00.889
And everything you do has consequences.

00:37:00.889 --> 00:37:03.489
I have asked Jehovah many times to forgive me

00:37:03.489 --> 00:37:05.389
for all the things I have done.

00:37:05.389 --> 00:37:06.690
And the brothers too,

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:09.889
all the people I offended by my actions.

00:37:09.889 --> 00:37:12.090
All of those trophies I won,

00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:14.289
every last one of them,

00:37:14.289 --> 00:37:16.989
are their collecting dust.

00:37:16.989 --> 00:37:19.289
But Jehovah has given me a different kind of trophy

00:37:19.289 --> 00:37:21.690
in his organization,

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:25.190
helping others to dedicate their lives to him.

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:28.889
That's something no one can take away from you.

00:37:28.889 --> 00:37:30.989
We don't all have to learn the hard way.

00:37:30.989 --> 00:37:32.989
We have to keep enduring

00:37:32.989 --> 00:37:35.690
and never turn our backs on Jehovah.

00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:39.789
That's the worst mistake anyone could make.

00:37:39.789 --> 00:37:43.090
We know that it's Jehovah who gives us our talents.

00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:46.789
So we should use them on his service.

00:37:46.789 --> 00:37:49.590
I have found happiness.

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:53.590
And that gives me a glow that's not just for the cameras.

00:37:53.690 --> 00:38:02.449
Everyone who knows me can see it.

00:38:02.449 --> 00:38:06.349
Brother Franco enjoys serving as both a regular pioneer

00:38:06.349 --> 00:38:08.349
and congregation elder.

00:38:08.349 --> 00:38:10.550
He feels privileged to shepherd young people

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:14.349
facing some of the same temptations he experienced.

00:38:14.349 --> 00:38:16.150
He often relates a favorite scripture

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:19.250
from Proverbs chapter eight, verse 35.

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:20.449
Referring to wisdom,

00:38:20.449 --> 00:38:22.050
that scripture says,

00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:25.349
for the one finding me will find life

00:38:25.349 --> 00:38:28.449
and he receives approval from Jehovah.

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:30.150
Brothers and sisters,

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:33.949
Jehovah does want us to find life.

00:38:33.949 --> 00:38:37.949
And he wants us to be successful in our spiritual pursuits.

00:38:37.949 --> 00:38:39.650
In this Bethel morning worship,

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:41.550
Brother Robert Lucioni discusses

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:46.849
how we can reach the potential that Jehovah knows we have.

00:38:46.849 --> 00:38:48.650
Our text today is very encouraging

00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:52.349
as it reminds us through this example of Amos,

00:38:52.349 --> 00:38:54.750
that Jehovah notices the potential

00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:56.750
of each one of his servants.

00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:59.650
In fact, one of the comments from today's text states,

00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:02.750
even though we may lack self confidence,

00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:06.449
Jehovah can help us go beyond our perceived limits

00:39:06.449 --> 00:39:09.849
and reach goals that we would not have imagined.

00:39:09.849 --> 00:39:12.949
See, Jehovah knows our potential.

00:39:12.949 --> 00:39:14.949
But you note from that statement,

00:39:14.949 --> 00:39:18.750
this is also a reminder that we have to put forth effort

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:20.750
to reach our potential.

00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:21.949
You see, if we're not careful,

00:39:21.949 --> 00:39:24.750
we can sabotage our own efforts

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:27.849
to reach the potential that Jehovah sees in us.

00:39:27.849 --> 00:39:29.349
How's that possible?

00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:31.750
Well, let's look at three examples.

00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:34.150
Number one, we can limit potential

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:38.349
by not throwing ourselves into what we are asked to do.

00:39:38.349 --> 00:39:40.750
We may remember the account of Jehoash,

00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:42.050
the King of Israel,

00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:44.349
there in 2nd Kings chapter 13,

00:39:44.349 --> 00:39:47.949
when he visited the prophet, Alisha, who was dying.

00:39:47.949 --> 00:39:52.650
And you notice there in 2nd Kings chapter 13 and verse 17

00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:56.449
that Alisha notes Jehoash's potential.

00:39:56.449 --> 00:40:00.650
You notice he says there that you will strike down Syria

00:40:00.650 --> 00:40:02.750
until you finish it off.

00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:07.150
See, he noted the potential that he had to finish off Syria.

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:08.650
But then what happens?

00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:11.449
Well, you remember that's where the King tells the...

00:40:11.449 --> 00:40:15.449
Alisha tells the King to beat the arrows on the ground three times

00:40:15.449 --> 00:40:18.250
or beat it on the ground and he only does it three times.

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:21.150
Notice what happens in verse 19.

00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:25.150
At that, the man of the true God grew indignated him and said,

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:28.650
you should have struck the ground five or six times

00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:32.949
then you would have struck down Syria until you finished it off.

00:40:32.949 --> 00:40:37.250
But now you will strike down Syria only three times.

00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:38.750
What happened?

00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:42.050
Well, you see, by not throwing himself into what he was asked to do

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:44.150
showing zeal for his assignment,

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:46.349
he would only have limited success.

00:40:46.349 --> 00:40:50.550
Jehoash limited his own potential.

00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:55.349
Number two, we can limit our potential by focusing on our inadequacies

00:40:55.349 --> 00:40:57.349
or our insecurities.

00:40:57.349 --> 00:41:00.650
And a count that drives that home for me is that of Moses.

00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:03.349
If you look in Exodus chapter three.

00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:07.050
And in this account, we know it's not due to lack of zeal

00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:09.550
or rather Moses' own insecurities

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:13.550
that nearly caused him to limit how he was used by Jehovah.

00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:15.250
So we know in Exodus chapter three,

00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:18.750
he received a very weighty assignment going to Pharaoh.

00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:22.250
And notice what happens in verse 11, Exodus three,

00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:26.349
11, it says, however, Moses said to the true God,

00:41:26.349 --> 00:41:30.449
who am I, then I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites

00:41:30.449 --> 00:41:31.449
out of Egypt.

00:41:31.449 --> 00:41:32.750
Now, that's a normal reaction.

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:33.949
We probably would have felt the same way.

00:41:33.949 --> 00:41:36.949
Jehovah, are you sure you have the right person here?

00:41:36.949 --> 00:41:38.750
And Jehovah says, no, I do.

00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:40.550
I will be with you.

00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:42.849
You look on verse 13,

00:41:42.849 --> 00:41:44.550
says, but Moses said to the true God,

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:47.349
suppose I go to Israel and say to them,

00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:49.550
the God of your forefathers has sent me to you.

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:51.550
And they say to me, what's his name?

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:53.349
What should I say to them?

00:41:53.349 --> 00:41:54.449
Jehovah says no problem.

00:41:54.449 --> 00:41:57.650
And he explains his name even tells him what his name means.

00:41:57.650 --> 00:42:01.050
And how that power will be behind him.

00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:03.650
Chapter four, in verse one.

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:07.150
However, Moses answered, but suppose they do not believe me.

00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:08.550
And they do not listen to my voice.

00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:11.150
For they'll say Jehovah did not appear to you.

00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:11.949
No problem, Moses.

00:42:11.949 --> 00:42:13.150
What's in your hand?

00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:14.150
So he has the staff.

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:16.349
He shows some miracles that he can perform to show

00:42:16.349 --> 00:42:18.650
that Jehovah is behind him.

00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:20.449
Look at verse 10.

00:42:20.449 --> 00:42:23.150
Moses now said to Jehovah, pardon me, Jehovah,

00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:24.949
but I have never been a fluent speaker,

00:42:24.949 --> 00:42:27.849
neither in the past nor since you spoken to your servant

00:42:27.849 --> 00:42:31.550
where I am slow of speech and slow of tongue.

00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:33.949
Okay, Moses, who created the mouth?

00:42:33.949 --> 00:42:35.050
I'll speak for you.

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:36.849
Don't worry about it.

00:42:36.849 --> 00:42:38.750
Look at verse 13.

00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:39.849
But he says pardon me.

00:42:39.849 --> 00:42:43.150
Jehovah, please send anyone whom you want to send.

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:45.650
And notice what says in verse 14.

00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:49.849
Then Jehovah's anger blazed against Moses.

00:42:49.849 --> 00:42:52.449
Fine, you know, I'm going to just send somebody else.

00:42:52.449 --> 00:42:54.949
But thankfully Moses got the point.

00:42:54.949 --> 00:42:56.349
He jumped into the assignment

00:42:56.349 --> 00:42:58.150
which was used further by Jehovah.

00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:59.750
But what happened here?

00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:03.449
You notice Moses got caught up worrying about his inadequacies,

00:43:03.449 --> 00:43:05.849
worrying about all the things that could go wrong.

00:43:05.849 --> 00:43:08.250
Jehovah's saying, just get moving

00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:10.250
and I will take care of the rest.

00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:12.550
Jehovah saw that Moses had the potential

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:14.349
to carry out this assignment.

00:43:14.349 --> 00:43:17.250
However, Moses was limiting himself.

00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:20.650
At number three, we can limit our own potential

00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:24.750
by becoming paralyzed by fear, fear of failure.

00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:27.849
If you turn to the account in number chapter 13,

00:43:27.849 --> 00:43:30.750
we notice that this is what happened to the 10 spies.

00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:34.250
It's very interesting a phrase they use

00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:36.050
when they came back from spying out the land,

00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:41.639
number chapter 13 and look at verse 33.

00:43:41.639 --> 00:43:44.780
It says, and there we saw the Nephilim,

00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:47.780
the sons of Anach who were from the Nephilim.

00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:51.380
And in comparison, we seem like grasshoppers

00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:56.179
and notice both to us and to them.

00:43:56.179 --> 00:43:58.980
You see, they ran into these sons of Anach who were giants,

00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:00.579
men of extraordinary size,

00:44:00.579 --> 00:44:02.579
who inhabited the mountainous region of Canaan

00:44:02.579 --> 00:44:04.780
and it was understandable that these enemies

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:07.179
of Jehovah view the Israelites as puny,

00:44:07.179 --> 00:44:11.579
grasshoppers, you can just squash them and no competition.

00:44:11.579 --> 00:44:16.579
But you know the 10 spies saw themselves the same way.

00:44:17.079 --> 00:44:18.679
And see, their view of themselves

00:44:18.679 --> 00:44:21.179
in the situation paralyze them with fear

00:44:21.179 --> 00:44:24.300
and cause them to demoralize the entire nation.

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:26.739
But now in contrast, we think of the account of David,

00:44:26.739 --> 00:44:30.539
who has a young man also encountered a giant, Goliath.

00:44:30.539 --> 00:44:34.739
And remember Goliath also saw David as a dispenseless little boy

00:44:34.739 --> 00:44:37.619
and as a grasshopper, if you will.

00:44:37.619 --> 00:44:40.219
But did David see himself the same way?

00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:42.820
He says, you're coming to me with sword and spear.

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:46.059
I'm coming to you with the name of Jehovah.

00:44:46.059 --> 00:44:49.460
You see, David did not allow himself to be paralyzed by fear.

00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:53.699
He trusted in Jehovah and David lived up to the potential

00:44:53.699 --> 00:44:55.460
that Jehovah saw in him.

00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:58.260
So what's the lesson for us?

00:44:58.260 --> 00:44:59.820
Well, the lesson is, is this illustrate,

00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:01.420
these accounts illustrate that sometimes

00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:04.619
we can be our own worst enemy at times.

00:45:04.619 --> 00:45:07.219
See, lack of zeal, not throwing ourselves into the work

00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:11.780
as in the case of Jehoash or our own insecurities,

00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:14.820
as in the case of Moses or fear of failure,

00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:16.619
as in the case of the 10 spies,

00:45:16.619 --> 00:45:21.659
can cause us to limit the potential that Jehovah sees in us.

00:45:21.659 --> 00:45:22.739
So what do we do?

00:45:23.579 --> 00:45:26.139
Well, Jehovah's words to Gideon remind us

00:45:26.139 --> 00:45:27.139
of what we can do.

00:45:27.139 --> 00:45:29.940
And we invite you to turn to judges chapter six.

00:45:31.219 --> 00:45:33.539
And you remember that for seven years,

00:45:33.539 --> 00:45:37.179
the Midianites oppressed the nation of Israel.

00:45:38.099 --> 00:45:39.860
And Jehovah's angel appears to Gideon

00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:41.500
and says that he's going to deliver Israel

00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:43.380
out of this wicked nation.

00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:45.219
How could he possibly succeed?

00:45:45.219 --> 00:45:47.219
We read the account and Gideon saw himself

00:45:47.219 --> 00:45:49.900
as the least significant one of his father's house.

00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:51.219
And he said his father's house

00:45:51.219 --> 00:45:54.980
was the least significant family of the tribe of Manasseh,

00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:59.059
but yet Jehovah saw the potential that Gideon had.

00:45:59.059 --> 00:46:01.780
And what did Jehovah tell him to do?

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:05.380
Look at judges chapter six and verse 14.

00:46:07.059 --> 00:46:09.900
It says, Jehovah faced him and said,

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:13.420
Go with the strength you have.

00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:16.579
And you will save Israel out of Midian's hand.

00:46:16.579 --> 00:46:19.099
Is it not I who sent you?

00:46:20.059 --> 00:46:20.900
Interesting.

00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:24.460
Go with the strength you have.

00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:26.300
I know you cannot do it on your own strength.

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:30.460
Just get moving, throw everything you can into it.

00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:33.980
And I, Jehovah will make up the difference.

00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:35.820
See, that's what Jehovah is saying.

00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:38.539
And that's exactly what happened.

00:46:38.539 --> 00:46:41.340
So may we be determined to do the same.

00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:43.820
We know that none of us accomplished Jehovah's work

00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:46.260
on our own strength, on our own wisdom,

00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:47.539
on our own abilities.

00:46:47.539 --> 00:46:49.500
But when we receive an assignment,

00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:52.219
we need to just start moving.

00:46:52.219 --> 00:46:55.340
Do not let our inadequacies paralyze us.

00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:58.619
Do not let fear of failure paralyze us.

00:46:58.619 --> 00:46:59.980
Throw ourselves into the work.

00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:01.860
Have a zeal for the work.

00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:05.300
Go with the strength that you have.

00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:09.139
Trust in Jehovah to make up the difference.

00:47:09.139 --> 00:47:11.260
And you will live up to the potential

00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:12.739
that Jehovah sees in you.

00:47:14.219 --> 00:47:17.260
What excellent counsel for all of us,

00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:19.860
and especially for young ones with a life of service

00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:21.860
to God ahead of them.

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:25.900
That life with Jehovah can be everlasting.

00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:27.780
That is our firm hope.

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:30.460
Until then, will you remain loyal?

00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:34.860
Resist what the world offers you and reach your potential?

00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:38.659
Imagine your life 100 years from now.

00:47:38.659 --> 00:47:42.500
Will you regret the decades you gave to Jehovah?

00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:45.179
Will anything you endured in Satan's system

00:47:45.179 --> 00:47:48.659
slow you down from gaining life's prize?

00:47:48.659 --> 00:47:50.340
Some of our brothers and sisters

00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:54.619
can already look back that far and answer those questions.

00:47:54.619 --> 00:47:57.139
Sister Alma Miller's family learned the truth

00:47:57.139 --> 00:47:59.500
when she was 10 years old.

00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:04.500
She was baptized in 1937 and is now 107 years old.

00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:10.980
To her, just about everyone is a young person.

00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:13.420
See the encouraging effect her loving

00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:23.289
and faithful example has on young ones in her congregation.

00:48:23.289 --> 00:48:27.650
People often tell me why I never talked to a person

00:48:27.650 --> 00:48:30.650
that it was 107 years old.

00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:32.610
And I tell them, you know what?

00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:37.050
I never did either.

00:48:37.050 --> 00:48:41.329
I would describe Alma as probably the most energetic,

00:48:41.329 --> 00:48:45.329
100 plus year old lady that I've ever met.

00:48:45.329 --> 00:48:48.050
She has pretty much the whole see a critic history

00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:49.690
in her mind that she carries with her.

00:48:49.690 --> 00:48:51.929
So you can ask her anything about the organization

00:48:51.929 --> 00:48:53.809
and she can be able to tell you about it

00:48:53.809 --> 00:48:56.329
because she's even met a lot of those people.

00:48:56.329 --> 00:48:58.809
We read about it, but she lived it.

00:48:58.809 --> 00:48:59.969
She's amazing.

00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:03.050
Even though she's 107, she has an incredible memory.

00:49:04.849 --> 00:49:07.449
Yeah, I go back kind of ways.

00:49:07.449 --> 00:49:11.090
When I was very young, 10 years old,

00:49:11.090 --> 00:49:16.630
we saw the full drama of creation.

00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:19.710
And it was just packed with people.

00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:22.670
They were even standing in the back.

00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:26.469
We were so thrilled, we never forgot it.

00:49:27.789 --> 00:49:30.630
And we realized that we found the truth.

00:49:32.309 --> 00:49:38.309
My father left the church and he became one of Joe's witnesses.

00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:41.789
And he were called Bible students at that time.

00:49:42.789 --> 00:49:46.550
In the early days, we went to special conventions.

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:50.789
In some places, they had a big field where they put the cars

00:49:50.789 --> 00:49:52.989
and they set up their tents.

00:49:52.989 --> 00:49:56.230
They even named different streets.

00:49:56.230 --> 00:50:00.139
It was just like a little city.

00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:03.739
I was really thrilled to see brother brotherhood

00:50:03.739 --> 00:50:06.340
speak as the conventions I attended.

00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:12.900
I got married to Harold Miller in 1931.

00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:15.820
That was when the depression was going on.

00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:18.219
And times were very difficult.

00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:22.099
Everything was scarce.

00:50:22.099 --> 00:50:24.860
There were no jobs to be had.

00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:26.380
The food was rationed.

00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:29.260
People were really hungry.

00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:34.260
And they moved in any little shack that they could.

00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:36.699
Just to get by.

00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:40.019
We didn't have anything.

00:50:41.019 --> 00:50:44.739
And we couldn't drive the car.

00:50:44.739 --> 00:50:48.340
So we used to have a little white horse.

00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:52.230
The name was Lou.

00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:56.710
And we went out with the thing with the horse and buggy.

00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:59.469
She took us all over the place.

00:50:59.469 --> 00:51:01.469
Far distances.

00:51:02.469 --> 00:51:06.829
They would take this buggy and they would go 20, 30 miles.

00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:09.710
One direction, 20, 30 miles, the other direction.

00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:11.590
All the hard work that they put forth

00:51:11.590 --> 00:51:17.690
has resulted in several congregations in the area.

00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:21.530
We used to carry that magazine bag.

00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:24.809
We were witnessing for a while there.

00:51:24.809 --> 00:51:27.690
And so we put it around the horse's neck.

00:51:27.730 --> 00:51:31.210
And so the horse was taking part in our witnessing.

00:51:32.289 --> 00:51:34.610
People knew who was coming when they saw

00:51:34.610 --> 00:51:37.730
that little white horse come into their yard.

00:51:39.010 --> 00:51:41.369
Sometimes they just called.

00:51:41.369 --> 00:51:43.610
And I remember wearing two coats.

00:51:45.050 --> 00:51:46.530
Yeah, it's tiresome.

00:51:47.530 --> 00:51:48.730
But we were young.

00:51:50.449 --> 00:51:53.130
They would just go out regardless of rain or shine

00:51:53.130 --> 00:51:54.530
or whatever was going on at the time.

00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:55.570
And when they didn't have a car,

00:51:55.570 --> 00:51:56.369
and to me that's amazing

00:51:56.369 --> 00:51:59.090
because we get you so used to the conveniences

00:51:59.090 --> 00:52:01.170
I guess you could call it, the coffee breaks the cars

00:52:01.170 --> 00:52:02.329
and everything.

00:52:02.329 --> 00:52:04.050
It's like, well, if Alma can do it,

00:52:04.050 --> 00:52:05.050
surely I can do it.

00:52:06.730 --> 00:52:09.610
One time Harold went out with this thing

00:52:09.610 --> 00:52:12.690
and 50 years later he talked to the same man.

00:52:12.690 --> 00:52:17.730
He said, 50 years ago, there was a young guy

00:52:17.730 --> 00:52:21.489
who came through here writing on horseback

00:52:21.489 --> 00:52:24.849
and telling people that he said,

00:52:24.849 --> 00:52:27.489
I think it's Armageddon.

00:52:27.489 --> 00:52:30.050
He said was coming soon.

00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:32.610
And he remembered Harold writing horseback

00:52:32.610 --> 00:52:35.130
50 years ago in that territory.

00:52:35.130 --> 00:52:36.449
And he got there again.

00:52:38.289 --> 00:52:41.769
And that happened a couple times more.

00:52:41.769 --> 00:52:49.989
So it was a long life I would to see.

00:52:49.989 --> 00:52:52.869
Alma is so zealous for the ministry.

00:52:52.869 --> 00:52:55.710
She does not like not at homes.

00:52:55.710 --> 00:52:57.550
She wants to talk to people.

00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:01.230
Yeah, I enjoy the ministry.

00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:05.389
I go out as much as I can in my old age.

00:53:06.590 --> 00:53:10.110
We want to help the people to see the truth.

00:53:10.110 --> 00:53:16.429
There's no greater joy.

00:53:16.429 --> 00:53:19.230
I try to read the publications

00:53:19.230 --> 00:53:24.300
so I have a reading machine.

00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:27.300
The letters come right out of the screen

00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:29.739
and I can study Alma lessons.

00:53:31.019 --> 00:53:35.150
I would be lost without it.

00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:39.070
It helps me to keep up in present truth.

00:53:39.070 --> 00:53:43.070
What does dedication mean?

00:53:43.070 --> 00:53:45.070
Sister Miller, please.

00:53:45.070 --> 00:53:47.710
Dedication means.

00:53:47.710 --> 00:53:49.630
Some young ones might be concerned about

00:53:49.630 --> 00:53:52.309
what they should do with their life, what choices they should make.

00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:53.710
Well, here we see an example of somebody

00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:56.670
who served Jehovah for over 100 years.

00:53:56.670 --> 00:53:58.829
And we see that she's happy and has no regrets

00:53:58.829 --> 00:53:59.349
with their life.

00:53:59.349 --> 00:54:03.460
And that's an example that we want to imitate.

00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:06.300
For giving my life to Jehovah,

00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:11.389
that's the best thing I could do for myself.

00:54:11.389 --> 00:54:14.989
If I have any advice for young ones today,

00:54:14.989 --> 00:54:18.269
I would say to keep on the truth.

00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:23.429
They have a whole world before them

00:54:23.429 --> 00:54:25.630
to serve Jehovah.

00:54:25.630 --> 00:54:27.869
Something that endures forever.

00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:33.699
Wasn't that encouraging?

00:54:33.699 --> 00:54:36.380
With all the videos we use in our worship today,

00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:38.860
it's also interesting that Sister Miller's

00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:43.940
introduction to the truth was the photo drama of creation.

00:54:43.940 --> 00:54:47.739
That was a photographic slide and motion picture production,

00:54:47.739 --> 00:54:49.900
complete with color and sound,

00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:52.659
which first showed in 1914.

00:54:52.659 --> 00:54:56.139
You might enjoy learning more about that historic presentation

00:54:56.139 --> 00:54:58.980
as a personal study project.

00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:03.980
Sister Miller has experienced much in her 107 years.

00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:07.579
She's endured economic depression, health problems,

00:55:07.579 --> 00:55:09.940
and the loss of family and friends,

00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:12.300
including her dear husband.

00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:13.860
But as we saw,

00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:16.739
Jehovah has blessed her with a spiritual family

00:55:16.739 --> 00:55:18.579
in the congregation.

00:55:18.579 --> 00:55:20.820
At the same time, those interviewed

00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:23.420
with Sister Miller are enjoying a close friendship

00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:25.300
with someone older.

00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:28.179
Even very young ones are finding friends

00:55:28.179 --> 00:55:30.980
among older brothers and sisters.

00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:35.699
David, age nine, wrote this in his letter to the governing body.

00:55:35.699 --> 00:55:38.820
I like to listen to older ones.

00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:41.460
I just used to have a circle of friends,

00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:43.739
but now I feel more comfortable

00:55:43.739 --> 00:55:46.739
going and talking to older ones.

00:55:46.739 --> 00:55:48.460
It's no surprise, then,

00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:51.539
that in the latest become Jehovah's friend video,

00:55:51.539 --> 00:55:56.019
so feel learns that you're never too young or too old

00:55:56.019 --> 00:55:58.739
to be someone's friend.

00:56:21.139 --> 00:56:25.179
Sister Elsa, did you paint these?

00:56:25.179 --> 00:56:26.659
I did.

00:56:26.659 --> 00:56:27.900
They're amazing.

00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:30.099
How long have you been drawing?

00:56:30.099 --> 00:56:32.820
As long as I can remember,

00:56:32.820 --> 00:56:37.539
it's my way of being able to share all the stories of my life.

00:56:37.539 --> 00:56:39.380
Could you show me?

00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:41.539
Yes, of course.

00:56:41.539 --> 00:56:45.219
I remember a time when I was young in East Germany.

00:56:45.219 --> 00:56:49.260
We weren't allowed to do our work as Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:50.940
We were under ban.

00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:54.260
I helped in copying our watchtower magazines by hand

00:56:54.260 --> 00:56:56.699
and then hiding them in food.

00:56:56.699 --> 00:56:58.099
Did?

00:56:58.099 --> 00:56:59.099
Yes.

00:56:59.099 --> 00:57:03.460
We'd then send the food to our brothers who were in prison.

00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:05.820
I was also asked to help in distributing

00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:08.260
Bible literature to our congregations

00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:10.860
as an underground messenger.

00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:11.900
Wow.

00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:16.539
Time passed, and then things started getting better in Berlin.

00:57:16.539 --> 00:57:20.139
Shortly after, I immigrated to New York,

00:57:20.139 --> 00:57:25.940
and I met my darling husband.

00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:27.980
That was a great story.

00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:29.539
Thank you.

00:57:29.539 --> 00:57:32.260
But I'm sure you have stories.

00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:34.139
What do you like to draw?

00:57:34.139 --> 00:57:36.619
Well, actually here.

00:57:36.619 --> 00:57:39.219
This was the time when Caleb and I went to the park

00:57:39.219 --> 00:57:41.420
and he met a little girl there.

00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:44.059
I'm glad I reached out that day.

00:57:44.059 --> 00:57:53.099
Lasting friends can be of any age when they love Jehovah.

00:57:53.099 --> 00:57:56.900
Elsa and Sophia already share much in common

00:57:56.900 --> 00:57:59.780
and are likely to become good friends.

00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:02.980
We're pleased to announce that this new

00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:06.539
become Jehovah's friend lesson is available

00:58:06.539 --> 00:58:10.420
on video on demand under the children category.

00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:15.780
You parents and family heads are doing all you can

00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:19.420
to teach your children from infancy to love Jehovah

00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:21.460
and to become his friend.

00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:24.820
As they grow, you also teach them how to study

00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:26.739
and pray on their own.

00:58:26.739 --> 00:58:30.539
You know they need these spiritual skills.

00:58:30.539 --> 00:58:34.460
Young ones, remember that your personal study time

00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:37.219
is when you can ask Jehovah for help

00:58:37.219 --> 00:58:40.139
with what you are personally experiencing.

00:58:40.139 --> 00:58:44.059
And that study time has other good effects.

00:58:44.059 --> 00:58:46.260
As this music video tells us,

00:58:46.260 --> 00:59:17.699
study makes you strong.

00:59:17.699 --> 01:02:22.650
With that root, study makes you strong.

01:02:22.650 --> 01:02:26.090
Study does make us strong.

01:02:26.090 --> 01:02:27.969
As depicted in the music video,

01:02:27.969 --> 01:02:29.889
the Bible reading and study habits

01:02:29.889 --> 01:02:32.610
that the young sister started with her family

01:02:32.610 --> 01:02:35.449
became her own personal habits.

01:02:35.449 --> 01:02:37.769
When a challenging situation or opportunity

01:02:37.769 --> 01:02:39.409
to give a witness came along,

01:02:39.409 --> 01:02:41.889
she already knew how to research

01:02:41.889 --> 01:02:44.610
what she needed from the scriptures.

01:02:44.610 --> 01:02:48.289
Our prayer is that all of you young brothers and sisters

01:02:48.289 --> 01:02:51.409
grow spiritually strong in the same way

01:02:51.409 --> 01:02:55.889
and become examples to faithful ones everywhere.

01:02:55.889 --> 01:02:58.849
That brings us to our video postcard

01:02:58.849 --> 01:03:01.329
from faithful brothers and sisters.

01:03:01.329 --> 01:03:14.300
This month, we visit beautiful Austria in central Europe.

01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:19.099
Brother C. T. Russell first visited Austria in 1891.

01:03:19.099 --> 01:03:22.179
He returned in 1911 to plant further seeds

01:03:22.179 --> 01:03:25.539
of kingdom truth in the capital city Vienna.

01:03:25.539 --> 01:03:29.579
Today, there are more than 21,000 active publishers

01:03:29.579 --> 01:03:33.340
among the eight million who live in Austria.

01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:36.059
One of the 301 congregations

01:03:36.059 --> 01:03:39.300
is the German language congregation in Uden.

01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:43.619
They preach in a territory of Alpine mountains and valleys.

01:03:43.619 --> 01:03:46.139
Some farms are as high in elevation

01:03:46.139 --> 01:03:51.139
as 1,700 meters or more than 5,500 feet.

01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:55.739
But difficult terrain does not slow the kingdom message.

01:03:55.739 --> 01:03:58.619
The 48 publishers there recently reported

01:03:58.619 --> 01:04:02.420
conducting 51 Bible studies.

01:04:02.420 --> 01:04:06.619
We thank them for showing us another encouraging example

01:04:06.619 --> 01:04:09.099
of the brotherly love that unites

01:04:09.099 --> 01:04:15.900
God's people worldwide.

01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:18.539
They send us their Christian love and greetings

01:04:18.539 --> 01:04:20.619
and we send our love and return

01:04:20.619 --> 01:04:27.059
along with prayers for Jehovah's favor.

01:04:27.059 --> 01:04:29.260
We thank you for joining us

01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:32.900
and we look forward to an encouraging program next month.

01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:37.219
From Brooklyn, New York, this is J. W. Broadcasting.
