00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:19.410
I work as a pioneer and also as a commuter at Bethel.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.250
I find the service to be very enjoyable.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.250
However, because of my busy schedule, at times I almost forget to express my appreciation

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.649
to the brothers and sisters.

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:38.850
I wanted to express my appreciation to my wife, but I found myself feeling bashful in doing

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.850
so.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.570
I knew something wasn't quite natural.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:50.130
Generally, expressing appreciation is considered to be a virtue.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:57.579
But I realized that I needed some kind of stronger motivation.

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:06.519
Although all 10 lepers must have been grateful, yet only one person returned to give things.

00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:15.439
I suddenly realized that even if I feel appreciative, I might fail to express it.

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.280
Isal was an impatient man.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:25.280
In contrast, David thought deeply about how wonderful pure worship is.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:32.219
I came to realize that it is important to think deeply.

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:38.500
One sister was visiting a very sick sister almost every day to help her with shopping and

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.260
looking after her very tenderly.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:51.659
As I thought carefully about why she was doing so much and how she felt, I felt deep appreciation

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.040
well up in me.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.120
Jehovah richly rewards us.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:07.400
If Jehovah desires to express his appreciation, what kind of person am I if I don't show it

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.849
from the heart?

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:20.449
Perhaps I might be thinking to myself that I deserve to be appreciated since I am the

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:26.680
one providing for my family, aren't I?

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.039
I started thinking about how Jehovah wants to reward my wife.

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:37.759
That made me want to interact with her with kinder words.

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:45.759
I feel that the way I look at her and my facial expressions by changing as well.

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:50.719
It gets easier to resolve disagreements quickly.

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:56.960
I also feel that we are growing closer and closer as a couple.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.599
By expressing appreciation, I feel very happy.

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.199
My relationship with brothers and sisters within the congregation has gotten better and

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:10.280
the bonds of friendship between us are stronger.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.879
I realized that the reason why Jehovah encourages us to express our appreciation to others

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.879
is for our happiness.

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:20.800
That drew me even closer to Jehovah.
