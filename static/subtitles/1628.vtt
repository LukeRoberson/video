00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.620
Jesus gave His disciples an unmistakable composite sign of the last days.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:25.820
Now that sign prepares us to expect, among other things, an increase in disasters that can affect anyone.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.820
Now when disaster strikes, we're eager to help because of our love for our brothers and sisters and our neighbors.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.619
But disaster relief is also an important part of our sacred service to God.

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:48.619
The Apostle Paul wrote under inspiration as recorded at 2 Corinthians 8 and 4 about a relief ministry for the Holy Ones.

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:58.619
And at Acts 11, we read that Paul himself was selected to deliver famine relief to fellow worshippers in Jerusalem.

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:08.620
In 2 Corinthians 9, Paul went on to describe three benefits of the relief ministry that were true in the first century and are still very true today.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.620
First, our relief work moves people to glorify God.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.620
Second, it alleviates suffering and fills immediate needs.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.620
And finally, it enables fellow witnesses to get back to their spiritual routine.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:36.620
Today, the coordinators committee of the governing body responds to disasters, persecution, and other emergencies affecting our brotherhood anywhere in the world.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:43.620
The coordinators committee prayerfully considers reports from branch offices near the affected area.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:50.620
And they direct disaster relief committees to make the best use of funds donated to the worldwide work.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:57.620
On January 12, 2010, a catastrophic earthquake struck Haiti.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.620
Now disaster relief was quickly organized.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:09.620
You may recall the heartbreaking news that 154 of our brothers and sisters died and that many more were injured.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:17.620
But there were also encouraging reports of their strong faith and appreciation for the love of our worldwide brotherhood.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:31.180
Now, nearly six years later, what have been the long-term benefits of our ongoing relief ministry for these dear brothers and sisters?

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:57.639
During the earthquake, I lost my only daughter that I loved very much and I lost my mother.

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:59.639
It was hard.

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:04.639
But I could go through this because Chahova has always been there.

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:07.639
And my brothers and sisters have always been there.

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:12.639
After the earthquake, I was buried under the rubble for eight hours.

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:17.639
It was brothers from Bethel, trained specialist who traveled here to operate on Marla.

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:26.639
It was not one person from my church that came to see how I was doing, but I noticed that they were up to 20 to 25 at a time that came to see Marla.

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:32.639
We weren't able to go anywhere, so the brothers came to us and gave public talks on Sunday.

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:37.639
After the earthquake, the business I had in our two-story house was completely destroyed.

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.639
We lost everything.

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:44.639
We ended up in Kanawa, a camp for displaced persons.

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:50.639
When we arrived here, the organization arranged for us to have a shelter for us to care for our needs.

00:03:50.639 --> 00:04:00.650
Because we have this shelter, our spirituality has been fortified and we have the strength to continue serving Chahova.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.650
The family is spiritually strong.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.650
The shelter is still in very good shape and we have what we need to continue helping others in the territory.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.699
While in service, a woman called, saying,

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:17.699
Jehovah's Witnesses, Jehovah's Witnesses, come over here, I need to speak to you.

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:22.699
Where did your people are saying that God killed my child in the earthquake?

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:24.699
What do you say about that?

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:29.699
We used Genesis 18 and 25 to prove that God is not in righteous.

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:35.699
She replied, wow, those people are lying, but you have shown me the truth.

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:40.699
When you're later, we had a special campaign with when someone you loved dies brochure.

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:44.699
When we left the brochure with people and showed them the resurrection hope,

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:49.699
I noticed that some would cry, but it wasn't because they were still grieving for their loved ones.

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:56.699
Instead, it was because they saw the hope of seeing their loved ones again, that they were not lost forever.

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:01.699
My goal that I have before, and it was the goal of my daughter also,

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:06.699
is to go somewhere and preach where they need more Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:11.699
After the earthquake, I said, this is the time, and this is where I am now.

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:13.699
I've been here for four years.

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:19.699
I got good Bible studies and I got people who got baptized.

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:24.699
One of the biggest blessings is my sister that I love very much.

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:28.699
When she saw the way Jehovah helped me going through this,

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:34.699
she decided to study the Bible, and I got the privilege to study with her, and now she's baptized.

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:40.699
Soon after leaving the hospital, I was in service again, and regular pioneering.

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:45.699
Pioneering keeps me active, and I'm busy helping my Bible students.

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:51.699
Some of them have come to the truth, so I don't have time to sit and feel sorry for myself,

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:55.699
because of my situation, even though it's not so easy.

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:59.699
Pioneering helps me to be strong and stay on track.

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:05.699
I'm so happy that my mom was drawn to the truth because of the brother's love.

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:08.699
Today, we're serving Jehovah together.

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:12.699
I was impressed by how much love the brothers showed.

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:15.699
Today, I'm happy to be serving Jehovah.

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:19.699
Many said, these are truly God's people.

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:21.699
It is just as the Bible says.

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:27.649
They see your fireworks and give glory to Jehovah.

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:29.649
My daughter believed in resurrection.

00:06:29.649 --> 00:06:32.649
I remember she was eight years old, and she said,

00:06:32.649 --> 00:06:34.649
Mommy, you know, I don't want to die.

00:06:34.649 --> 00:06:43.339
But if I die, I'm sure Jehovah will resurrect me, and I'm waiting for that moment.

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:45.339
Jehovah keeps blessing me.

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:53.339
In one of the blessings, I got a letter for the school for Kingdom Evangelises.

00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:59.339
It is like Jehovah is telling me, I want you to continue.

00:06:59.339 --> 00:07:01.339
And I will.
