00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:10.820
It is so that Jehovah's Zeuge as a religious community in Germany is aware that it is on its open mission.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:23.820
However, it is also aware that there is a lot of advantage against this religious community, which is one of the causes for it.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:33.820
It was that it was a bit of a danger that led to the emergence of Jehovah's Zeuge as a community open mission.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.820
It took quite a long time, through several instances.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:47.820
This experience, through the stories, and through which all the arguments were brought forward,

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.820
the only things that were brought forward were against the Jehovah's Zeuge.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.820
It showed that the consequences were ungrateful.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:06.819
That is to say, today it is so lucky that I have to say that the fact that it is true is true and that it is true through the Parliament.

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:16.819
In Germany, in any case, that the Jehovah's Zeuge is a religious community that is represented by the great church.

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:24.819
It is so that in Germany, in the presence of extremism, there must not be a real war.

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:41.819
I can only say that with extremism in Russia, in Germany, you would understand that with political intentions, violence and violence,

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:47.819
that the state of power is motivated by the political intentions.

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:56.819
If that is the term of extremism, then I think that with the Jehovah's Zeuge,

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:07.819
that it is only a movement to pull, because it is known that the Jehovah's Zeuge does not follow political goals and in the future,

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:21.819
so I can say that from the German situation, there is probably no greater criminality rate than the Jehovah's Zeuge in Germany.

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:28.819
Yes, of course, there is, at the Jehovah's Zeuge, a certain moral representation,

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:36.819
that in comparison to the German society, there are a lot of fears.

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:46.819
So fear is a sexual moral, for example, or a conservative family picture,

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.819
but I do not know how to describe it as extremist.

00:02:52.819 --> 00:03:02.819
I cannot imagine that a church that makes all information to a certain extent,

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:09.819
to a decision could come, that the Jehovah's Zeuge as extremist or in some way,

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.819
would be politically dangerous.

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.819
In the past, there is also the Russian government,

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:23.819
I do not know if the possibility to stand up to the government.

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:29.819
But I think that it is certainly legitimate and true,

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:39.819
that one of our side, as I do now, also information about love,

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.819
that it is, at the Jehovah's Zeuge, something we all know,

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.819
not to be politically agitated by the religious community,

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.819
and that it is, in any case, always only dictators were there,

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.819
like the Nazis in Germany, where the Jehovah's Zeuge were forbidden.

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:05.819
And I do not think that Russia is today a dictator.
