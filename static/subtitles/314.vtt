WEBVTT

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:12.009
Juliana and I have been friends for a few years and we have been getting to know each other better for several months.

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:16.510
Things are going really well between us.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:22.510
I must say, when Nick asked me to join some friends for a little get together at the park,

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.510
I was getting suspicious when both our families were there.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.510
I said yes.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:37.630
I couldn't believe she didn't see it coming.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.630
We were both so excited and words spread fast.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.630
At the meeting the next day, everyone was congratulating us.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:52.979
My friend Natalie, especially, she was full of ideas.

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:54.979
I couldn't wait to start making plans.

00:00:54.979 --> 00:01:04.700
I never realized how much goes into a wedding and everyone had their own ideas of what we needed, even dad.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:14.700
We had to think about who we would invite, pick out flowers, decorations, a suit for Nick, and of course, a dress.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.700
This was going to be so much fun.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.700
Or so I thought.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.340
I soon found out there's a whole wedding related industry out there.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.340
They were trying to be helpful, but at the same time, this is how they make money.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:44.340
It seemed like nothing they had was modest and the cost for something I would only wear one day, I couldn't afford that.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.340
Everyone was so happy for me, but inside, I was really starting to feel the pressure.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.319
When we met back at Juliana's home, I was pretty confused.

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:03.319
She had been so happy a few days ago, but now, she was so stressed out.

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:06.319
It was like nobody was listening to what we wanted.

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:10.319
But to be honest, I'm not sure we knew what we wanted either.

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:21.509
I thought it would be good if maybe we could just take some time and think about what a Christian wedding should really be like.

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:26.509
We had a meeting with Brother Gray and Brother Sharpe the next day to discuss using the Kingdom Hall for our wedding.

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:30.509
They gave us some helpful reminders and I'm so glad they did.

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:35.509
1 Corinthians chapter 10 verse 31 says,

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:42.509
Whether you're eating or drinking or doing anything else, do all things for God's glory.

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:53.509
Brother Sharpe helped us to see that a wedding is a spiritual occasion, and we need to keep Jehovah's standards in mind when we plan for what we will or won't choose to include.

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:58.509
Brother Gray showed us 1 John chapter 2 verses 15 and 16.

00:02:58.509 --> 00:03:14.509
Do not love either the world or the things in the world, because everything in the world, the desire of the flesh, and the desire of the eyes, and the showy display of one's means of life, originates with the world.

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:27.509
He reminded us that what the worldviews as normal is far different from Christian standards, and that we can be a good example by making sure our choices pleased Jehovah.

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:31.509
They even gave us a few articles about wedding arrangements to review.

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:35.509
They wanted to make sure we would have a happy occasion with nothing to regret.

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:46.270
I asked Brother Sharpe if he would be our director of the feast to help keep things coordinated, and he suggested that we talk about it over dinner that night.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.969
On the way there, we passed by a photography studio.

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:55.969
I couldn't believe how lavish and showy some weddings are.

00:03:55.969 --> 00:04:01.969
It looked more like an excuse to party, instead of something that's supposed to honor God.

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:04.969
It reminded me of the book of Galatians.

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:10.969
Now the works of the flesh are drunkenness, while parties, and things like these.

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:13.969
We didn't want to do anything like that.

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:18.970
We each took the time to perfectly consider the material their brothers gave us.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.970
We saw that scriptural principles can even help us plan a wedding.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.970
That's affordable, enjoyable for everyone, and a day that honors Jehovah.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.050
It looked like we needed to make some adjustments.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.050
We couldn't include everything we originally thought.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.050
Some things were just too expensive.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:49.379
And we wanted to make sure that none of our choices reflected the spirit of the world.

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:55.379
So we decided to start over and make sure we were doing things Jehovah's way.

00:04:55.379 --> 00:05:04.379
First Timothy chapter 2 verse 9 says that a Christian should adorn themselves in appropriate or respectable dress,

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:07.379
with modesty and soundness of mind.

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:17.379
It took some work, but we were able to find something affordable, appropriate, and beautiful.

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:23.040
I was able to find a nice suit.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.040
Something I could even wear later.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:33.180
And of course, the girls came by to make sure that everything matched.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.180
Time went by so fast.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:42.519
I called for the sharp so you could help us follow through on the day of the wedding.

00:05:42.519 --> 00:05:48.519
Before we knew it, we were sending out invitations and finalizing all the details.

00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:56.110
When my dad walked me down the aisle that day, I was so excited.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.550
Juliana was so beautiful.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:10.100
And the ceremony was just perfect.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:16.180
After all that planning we did, we were sure to make it legal.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:22.180
When looking back at our photos, it brings back so many good memories.

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.180
I was so happy with how nice everything turned out.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:32.180
And when we saw what a great job our friends had done decorating their reception, I couldn't believe my eyes.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.180
It was perfect.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.180
Simple, dignified.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:42.180
Our friends all told us it was one of the nicest weddings they've been to.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.180
Everything that day was just what we wanted.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.180
It even stayed on budget.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:53.180
And most importantly, we got our marriage off to a good start with Jehovah's help.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:58.449
I'm so happy we found each other.

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:01.449
I'm so happy I found you to love.

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:05.449
And I know we'll stay happy if we keep Jehovah first.
