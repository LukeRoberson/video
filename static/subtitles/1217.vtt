00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:04.940
Jacob was 77 years old.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.939
He was unmarried and hated by his twin brother Esau.

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:11.939
At the direction of his parents,

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:15.939
Jacob fled to the land of Abraham's relatives.

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:19.280
When he stopped to rest for the night,

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:25.750
Jehovah gave Jacob full assurance of divine support.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.750
In a dream, Jacob saw a ladder or stairway

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.750
leading from Earth to heaven.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.750
Angels were busily ascending and descending the stairway.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.750
Then Jehovah spoke to Jacob saying,

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.750
I am with you,

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.750
and I will safeguard you wherever you go.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.750
Just as Jehovah proved to be with Jacob,

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.750
so he has been with his people throughout history.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:01:10.459
From ancient times to our day,

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:13.459
this world has tried to disturb the peace

00:01:13.459 --> 00:02:16.229
that God's people enjoy.

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:20.229
Jehovah cares for his people.

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:33.939
Guided by Jehovah's Holy Spirit,

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:35.939
and with the support of the angels,

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:43.469
we are able to stand by our brothers and sisters under attack.

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:46.469
As a result, we feel as though we are standing

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:50.469
as one person against Satan's attacks.

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:54.469
Jehovah is truly on our side.
