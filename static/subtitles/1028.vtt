00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:20.370
Our Sun is considered an average star, yet the energy from the Sun that reaches the Earth

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:33.590
is thousands of times the world's total energy use.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:48.229
With our unated eyes we might see about 3,000 stars on a dark night, many in a fuzzy band.

00:00:48.229 --> 00:01:03.750
The Milky Way Galaxy, where our Sun is just one of perhaps 200 to 400 billion stars.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:12.989
Astronomers think the Milky Way Galaxy is clustered together with around 100,000 large galaxies

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:18.109
in a massive structure called a supercluster.

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:31.560
But together with an estimated 2 trillion galaxies, make up the known physical universe.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:39.200
Countless stars spread over unfathomable distances, releasing immense amounts of energy

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:46.000
may be impossible to grasp for us, but not for Jehovah.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.640
He counts the number of the stars, he calls all of them by name.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:02:04.060
Our Lord is great and is mighty in power.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:33.539
Millions of cubic meters of water circulates continually around our planet.

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:44.180
Near the poles water that is colder, saltier and denser sinks, creating a flow almost 100 times

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.460
that of the Amazon River.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:54.659
This drives a massive circulation of water that may take 1,000 years to complete.

00:02:54.659 --> 00:03:00.189
The global ocean conveyor belt.

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:17.240
This enormous system distributes heat, which helps to stabilize the weather and transports

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.599
great quantities of nutrients around the world.

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:44.879
So that life may flourish in abundance.

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:52.740
Jehovah set these mechanisms in motion and understands them perfectly.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:04:07.789
You rule over the raging of the sea when its waves surge you calm.

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:20.529
Trees can grow very strong and withstand powerful forces.

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:26.490
But if they didn't decompose after they die, trees and leaves would pile up with their

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.569
nutrients locked away inside.

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.569
Yet they do decompose.

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:35.709
How?

00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:41.970
Most animals cannot eat fallen wood and leaves.

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:52.879
But fungi can, they break down the dead plant tissues, making them softer, beetles and

00:04:52.879 --> 00:05:00.439
termites, bore through the wood exposing more surface area and spreading the fungi inside,

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:07.339
which soften it further so that other insects can enjoy the feast.

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:18.800
Earthworms aerate the soil and pull nutrients down where they can be used by other plants.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:26.490
Decomposes have been called the unsung heroes of the natural world.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:34.670
They recycle organic matter so that it is available to support new life.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:41.629
Through this process, Jehovah made it possible for us to enjoy Earth's lush beauty, generation

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:46.129
after generation.

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:52.490
But the fields and everything in them rejoice at the same time that all the trees of the

00:05:52.490 --> 00:06:14.430
forest shout joyfully.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:27.370
Hale, though it is made of ice, it is very different from snow.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:35.009
Hale usually forms in warm weather when turbulent air produces thunderstorms with powerful

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:37.850
updrafts.

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:44.290
These updrafts can pull a piece of dust or ice high into the cloud where water freezes

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:45.970
around it.

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:52.610
Each trip up into the cloud adds a layer of ice and weight.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:07:04.180
Until it becomes a hail stone that is heavy enough to fall, hail storms can be powerfully

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:09.860
destructive.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:18.540
One deadly storm dropped hail stones weighing more than one kilogram each.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:25.339
Jehovah used Hale to demonstrate his power and defend his people, such as during the

00:07:25.339 --> 00:07:29.740
seventh plague against Egypt.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:36.180
When Joshua fought the Amorites, Jehovah caused a great hail storm and more Amorites died

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:41.939
from the hail stones done in battle.

00:07:41.939 --> 00:07:48.139
Hale is also mentioned among the elements Jehovah will use in the future against those

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:51.259
who attack his people.

00:07:51.259 --> 00:07:56.939
Have you seen the storehouses of the Hale which I have reserved for the day of battle

00:07:56.939 --> 00:08:05.589
and war?

00:08:05.589 --> 00:08:17.029
The largest animal alive on earth today is also the largest that has ever lived.

00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:25.959
The blue whale.

00:08:25.959 --> 00:08:35.559
Blue whales can grow to be over 30 meters long and weigh up to 180 tons.

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:40.879
Its heart alone may weigh several hundred kilograms.

00:08:40.879 --> 00:08:47.730
How does such a large creature find enough to eat?

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:57.980
The blue whale migrates great distances to find tiny crustaceans known as krill.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:04.019
When a blue whale finds a school of krill, it accelerates towards the krill.

00:09:04.019 --> 00:09:09.059
Opens its giant mouth.

00:09:09.059 --> 00:09:17.669
They main gulf hundreds of kilograms of krill with each lunge, amounting to several

00:09:17.669 --> 00:09:22.279
tons per day.

00:09:22.279 --> 00:09:24.480
Blue whales eat a lot.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:47.090
Yet, Jehovah provides for them and he will provide for us.

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:55.850
There is the sea, so great and wide, teeming with countless living things, both small and

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:56.850
great.

00:10:07.129 --> 00:10:12.059
Our bones are amazing.

00:10:12.059 --> 00:10:23.820
They support our bodies, protect our organs and store almost all of the bodies calcium,

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:29.470
a mineral essential for our health.

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:36.759
For their weight, bones are very strong.

00:10:36.759 --> 00:10:42.720
The feats of a track and field jumper may experience forces of several times his body

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:48.019
weight.

00:10:48.019 --> 00:10:57.730
The bones can compress and bend, but sometimes they break.

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:03.370
A fractured bone can heal well, if properly said.

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:10.330
Inflenation brings organic building blocks to the area and soft tissue grows between the

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:14.230
broken pieces.

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:19.940
The soft tissue is replaced with harder tissue.

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:33.700
The body replaces the harder tissue with new bone, until the repair is complete.

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:39.500
In children, the brake may heal without leaving a trace.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:47.340
Jehovah gave every bone in our body this incredible ability to heal.

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:54.820
I praise you because in an awe-inspiring way, I am wonderfully made.
