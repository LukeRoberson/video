00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:20.510
This 2021 convention is being broadcast in 240 lands.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.510
We anticipate over 14 million individuals

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.510
will be able to enjoy the program by this means.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.510
Your generous donations make this possible.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.509
Donations can be made online at donate.jw.org.

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:43.890
In the past, Jehovah performed miracles that strengthened the faith of his servants.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.890
Is he performing miracles in our day?

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.890
Let's listen as Brother David's plane of the governing body provides the answer.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:01:04.319
In the talk, Jehovah's powerful works inspire faith.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:08.319
Jehovah is a miracle worker.

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:10.319
What's a miracle?

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:12.319
How would you describe it?

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:16.319
Well, let's give a simple definition.

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:22.319
A miracle is a powerful work that can't be explained in human terms.

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:26.319
Whenever Jehovah performs a miracle, he has a purpose.

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:31.319
One reason might be to strengthen the faith of his servants.

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:39.319
And as the title of this talk, Jehovah's powerful works inspire faith.

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:42.319
Well, we love to consider the miracles recorded in the Bible.

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:45.319
It's really faith-strengthening, isn't it?

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:49.319
So during this talk, we're going to consider just a few.

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:51.319
How about this one?

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:54.319
Jehovah leads the Israelites out of Egypt.

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:58.319
They arrive at the Red Sea, and it seems they're trapped.

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:02.319
The seas ahead of them, Pharaoh and his armies are behind.

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:06.319
But Jehovah causes the waters of the Red Sea to part,

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:09.319
and the Israelites cross over on dry land.

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.319
When Pharaoh and his armies follow,

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.319
Jehovah brings the sea back to its normal condition

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.319
and the cream of the crop of Egyptian manhood drowns.

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.319
Now we know what effect that miracle had on the Egyptians,

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.319
but what effect they did have on the Israelites.

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.319
Let's see Exodus chapter 14 and verse 31.

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.319
I'll give you a moment so you can find that.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:39.319
Exodus chapter 14 and verse 31.

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.599
It says, Israel also saw the great power

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.599
that Jehovah wielded against the Egyptians,

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:53.599
and the people began to fear Jehovah and to put faith in Jehovah.

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:59.599
So that miracle inspired faith in the Israelites.

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.599
Now they were the only ones who were impressed by that miracle.

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.599
Let's fast forward 40 years.

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.599
Two spies entered Jericho and go to the house of rehab,

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.599
the prostitute, and she says to them,

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:17.599
we heard how Jehovah dried up the waters of the Red Sea.

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.599
When we heard about it, we lost heart.

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.599
For Jehovah, your God is God in the heavens above,

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.599
and earth and the earth beneath.

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:32.599
Just hearing about that miracle inspired faith in rehab.

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.599
Now another person whose faith was strengthened

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.599
by a powerful work might surprise you.

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.599
A queen of Shiba.

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.599
Well, the queen of Shiba, what was the powerful work?

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.599
Outstanding wisdom.

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.599
She'd heard about the wisdom of Solomon,

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:52.599
and her curiosity got the better of her.

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.599
She just had to see if the report was true.

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:03.599
And that involved a 1200 mile trip from her country to Jerusalem.

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.599
The trip turned out to be well worth the effort.

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.599
At the end of the visit, the queen of Shiba sent to Solomon,

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.599
made Jehovah your God be praised who has taken pleasure in you

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:17.600
by putting you on the throne of Israel.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.600
She gave credit to Jehovah for what she saw.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.600
Now we don't know if she ever became a worshiper of Jehovah,

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.600
but Jesus said that she'd rise up in the judgment

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.600
and condemn those Jews who wouldn't even cross the street

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.600
to listen to the Son of God.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.600
Well, those who just two examples,

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.600
and as you know, there are many more in the Bible.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.600
The Apostle Paul lists some of them at Hebrews chapter 11,

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.600
and we're going to read verses 32 to 34.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.939
Hebrews chapter 11, I'll give you a moment,

00:04:55.939 --> 00:05:00.939
verses 32 to 34, and I'm going to read verse 32 first.

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:07.920
Hebrews 11, 32 to God it.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.920
And what more will I say?

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.920
For time will fail me if I go on to read aid about Gideon,

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:20.920
Beirack, Samson, Jeff the David, as well as Samuel,

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.920
and the other prophets.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.920
Now, as I read verses 33 and 34,

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:32.920
I want you children to look at the events that are being described

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.920
and see if you can guess who was involved,

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.920
who was the object of this miracle.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.920
So let's read verse 33.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.920
It says, through faith,

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.920
they defended kingdoms,

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.920
brought about righteousness,

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.920
obtained promises,

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.920
stopped the mouths of lions,

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.920
quenched the force of fire,

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.920
escaped the edge of the sword.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.920
From a weak state were made powerful,

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.920
became mighty in war,

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.920
routed invading armies.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.920
Now let's go back,

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.920
and see if we can identify individuals

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.920
who were involved in those miracles.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.920
How about defeated kingdoms?

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.920
Did you come up with someone?

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.920
Let's talk about Gideon.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.920
Now we like Gideon.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.920
He reminds us of us.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.920
He wasn't exactly brimming with confidence.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.920
When an angel approached him and indicated

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.920
that Jehovah had worked for him to do,

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:34.920
Gideon said,

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.920
My clan is the least emanasa,

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.920
and I am the most insignificant in my father's house.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.920
He said something else,

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.920
something that has a bearing on the theme of our discussion.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.920
He said to the angel,

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.920
If Jehovah is with us,

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.920
where are all his wonderful acts

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.920
that our father's related to us?

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.920
Yes, where were the powerful works?

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.920
Before he was going to stick his neck out,

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.920
Gideon wanted some kind of reassurance

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.920
that he had Jehovah's blessing.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.920
What to do?

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.920
What was the angel going to do?

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.920
He performed a powerful work,

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.920
and that inspired faith in Gideon.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.920
Later, Gideon's confidence was through

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.920
their boosted by three other remarkable signs,

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.920
through involving a fleece

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.920
and another involving a God-given dream.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.920
Now, with those powerful works in mind

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.920
and with Jehovah's help,

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.920
Gideon did the impossible.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.920
With 300 men,

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:45.920
he defeated an army of 135,000.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.920
Now, what's the take away?

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.920
What's the lesson for us?

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.920
With Jehovah on our side,

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.920
we are never outnumbered.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.920
Let's go back to verse 33.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:58.920
Now, you children,

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.920
I'm sure you're going to get this next one,

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.920
verse 33,

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.920
stopped the mouths of lions.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.920
Who did that?

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.920
Well, it was the same one who helped Gideon

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.920
defeat the Midianites.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:13.920
It was Jehovah,

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.920
but what was the circumstance?

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:16.920
Well, you know,

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.920
it was when Daniel was thrown into the lion's pit.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.920
Now, when Daniel was condemned to die,

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.920
he didn't know for sure that Jehovah was going to rescue him,

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.920
but he knew that Jehovah would do the right thing.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.919
He could have that confidence

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:35.919
because Jehovah had been with him throughout his life.

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:39.919
Daniel had been condemned to die once before.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:44.580
No, wait a minute, let's think about that.

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:48.580
Daniel had been condemned to die once before.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.580
When was that?

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.580
Well, it was when the king of Babylon had a dream,

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:57.580
and he decreed that unless Daniel and the other wise men of Babylon

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.580
could tell him what he dreamed

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.580
and then relate the meaning of the dream,

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.580
they would all be put to death.

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.580
That called for a powerful work.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:11.580
Jehovah provided Daniel with the information he needed,

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.580
and Daniel's life was saved.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:16.580
Well, that was Babylon.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.580
Now we're in Persia,

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:21.580
and Daniel is once more facing death.

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:24.580
Death by lion.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:27.580
And once again, Jehovah comes to the rescue.

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:32.580
He temporarily shuts the mouths of those lions.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:35.580
Well, we're going to imagine what effect that had on Daniel,

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:36.580
but what about us today?

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:37.580
What's the takeaway?

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.580
What's the lesson?

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:43.580
Today, Satan is walking about

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:47.580
like a roaring lion seeking to devour someone.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.580
We may never know how often Jehovah shuts the mouth

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:54.580
of that lion, how often Jehovah protects his people

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.580
as a group from Satan.

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.580
When we're working from door to door, for example,

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.580
it's dangerous out there.

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:05.580
And we probably have no idea how busy the angels are

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.580
in our behalf.

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:09.580
And if someone does lose his life

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:12.580
while in Jehovah's service or at a meeting,

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.580
and it has happened,

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.580
his loved ones can be sure of two things.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.580
First of all,

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:23.580
their loved ones did not lose Jehovah's approval.

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:25.580
And second,

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:27.580
the loss is only temporary.

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:31.580
Satan can never do us any lasting harm.

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:37.580
And one day, Jehovah will shut that lion's mouth permanently.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.580
Now, back to Hebrews 11.

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.580
And this time, we're reading verse 34.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.580
And I'm sure your kids are going to guess this one.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.580
Verse 34,

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.580
quenched the force of fire.

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.580
Of course,

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:54.580
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:56.580
There were court officials in Babylon,

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:58.580
and you'll recall that one day,

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:01.580
King Nebuchadnezzar made a huge image of gold

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.580
and demanded that everybody worship it.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:09.580
Anyone who refused would be thrown into the burning fiery furnace.

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:11.580
Well, that was a time to remember

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:14.580
Jehovah's power for works of the past.

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:17.580
And the three men had experienced that,

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:20.580
probably when they were just teenagers.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.580
Can you think of how?

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:24.580
When they arrived in Babylon,

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:27.580
they were taken to the palace for a special training,

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:30.580
and they were told to eat whatever was put in front of them.

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:34.580
In this case, some of the food was prohibited under the Mosaic law.

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:40.580
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refused to eat those foods,

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.580
and they asked to be given vegetables and water instead.

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:46.580
Now, for some of you children,

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:49.580
just the thought of having to eat vegetables all the time

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:51.580
is probably quite a test.

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:54.580
But now, think of the results of this diet.

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.580
After only 10 days,

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:59.580
the three young men were in much better health

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:01.580
than those who had followed the King's diet.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:04.580
Now, if you've ever had to follow a diet,

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.580
you know that there's no way that you can show improvement

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.580
in just 10 days.

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:12.580
Jehovah had to have been involved.

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:16.580
Now, they were facing death.

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:18.580
They knew their God.

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.580
They knew what he was capable of.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:23.580
They told the King that if it was the will of God,

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.580
they wouldn't be rescued.

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:30.580
But if not, they still wouldn't worship the image of gold.

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:34.580
They knew that if Jehovah chose not to intervene miraculously,

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:39.580
it was not a sign of his disapproval.

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.580
Well, you know what happened.

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:44.580
They were thrown into the fiery furnace.

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.580
But God sent his angel to protect them.

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.580
And when they stepped out of the furnace,

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:53.580
there wasn't even the smell of fire on them.

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.580
Their integrity also resulted in a great witness.

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:59.580
When the King saw that they were alive and well,

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.580
he praised Jehovah.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.580
He said, Praise be the God of Shadrach,

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.580
Meshach and Abednego.

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:08.580
There is no other God who was able to rescue.

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.580
Like this one.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:13.580
What a witness that does.

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:16.580
Well, that's what happened back then.

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:17.580
What's the takeaway?

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.580
What's the lesson?

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:24.580
Today, many brothers are facing the heat of adversity.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:26.580
Russia, for example.

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:29.580
Well, many brothers have been given long prison sentences

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:33.580
because they won't bow down to the state.

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.580
Now, Jehovah doesn't prevent this from happening.

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.580
Any more than he prevented Shadrach,

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:41.580
Meshach and Abednego from being thrown into the furnace.

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:43.580
But he does help them.

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:47.580
What do we notice about them as they're being led off the prison?

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.580
They're smiling.

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:50.580
They're serene.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.580
They're at peace.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.580
They know their God.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.580
And when they come out,

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:58.580
there won't even be the smell of fire on them.

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:01.580
Their faith will be intact.

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:04.580
Their fine conduct also results in a good witness

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:09.580
to the jailers and others who hear about the first execution.

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:12.580
Well, we'll take one more example in verse 34.

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:16.580
Escaped the edge of the sword.

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:18.580
I was thinking of Elisha.

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:21.580
Now, in the days of the prophet Elisha,

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:24.580
the king of Syria went to war against Israel,

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.580
and he called a war council,

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.580
and the Syrian sequently planned this strategy.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.580
But Jehovah kept telling Elisha

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:33.580
what the Syrians were up to,

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:37.580
and Elisha kept telling the king of Israel.

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:39.580
The Syrians were furious,

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:43.580
and the king said a large army to capture Elisha.

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:46.580
What in gratitude?

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:48.580
Why do we say that?

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:50.580
Because in the previous chapter,

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:52.580
we read that Elisha had cured the leprosy of Naaman,

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.580
a chief of the Syrian army,

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:59.580
and now a large Syrian army was hunting Elisha down.

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:03.580
We hope Naaman wasn't among them.

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:06.580
Finally, the Syrians found the city where Elisha was,

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.580
and they surrounded it.

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:11.580
Elisha's attendant was scared to death,

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:13.580
but Elisha wasn't afraid.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:19.580
2 Kings chapter 6 verses 16 and 17 explains why.

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:20.580
This is encouraging.

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:21.580
Face strengthening.

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:22.580
Let's look it up.

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:28.580
2 Kings chapter 6 verses 16 and 17.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:32.580
Now this is Elisha talking to his attendant.

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:34.580
Do not be afraid.

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:39.580
For there are more who are with us than those who are with them.

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.580
Then Elisha began to pray and say,

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:45.580
O Jehovah, open his eyes.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.580
Please, that he may see.

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:51.580
Immediately, Jehovah opened the attendant's eyes,

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:52.580
and he saw,

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:56.580
and look, the mountainous region was full of horses

00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:01.580
and chariots of fire all around Elisha.

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:04.580
Well, that was a miraculous occurrence

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:07.580
that was faith strengthening indeed.

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:09.580
What's the takeaway?

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:11.580
What's the lesson for us?

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:16.580
Well, one day, we'll be faced with hosts of modern day Syrians,

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:22.580
and what's going to help us to remain calm, unafraid?

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:24.580
We'll look heavenward,

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.580
and with our eyes of faith, we'll see myriads of angels

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.580
and count all around us.

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:33.580
We know that Jehovah will do the right thing,

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:38.759
whatever is in harmony with his will.

00:16:38.759 --> 00:16:39.759
I hear you say,

00:16:39.759 --> 00:16:44.759
I'd like to see a miracle that'd help a lot to strengthen my faith.

00:16:44.759 --> 00:16:46.759
We see miracles every day.

00:16:46.759 --> 00:16:48.759
What's a miracle?

00:16:48.759 --> 00:16:53.759
It's a powerful work that can't be explained in human terms.

00:16:53.759 --> 00:16:56.759
A modern example of that is prayer.

00:16:56.759 --> 00:16:58.759
Isn't prayer amazing?

00:16:58.759 --> 00:17:00.759
Can you explain it?

00:17:00.759 --> 00:17:05.759
Jehovah can listen to millions of prayers in any language all at once.

00:17:05.759 --> 00:17:07.759
That's a miracle.

00:17:07.759 --> 00:17:10.759
But how does prayer build our faith?

00:17:10.759 --> 00:17:14.759
When we pray about a problem that nobody but Jehovah knows about,

00:17:14.759 --> 00:17:16.759
and our prayer is answered,

00:17:16.759 --> 00:17:19.759
our faith is strengthened.

00:17:19.759 --> 00:17:21.759
Now that is powerful.

00:17:22.759 --> 00:17:26.759
And what about all the experiences we hear where someone desperately prayed to God

00:17:26.759 --> 00:17:31.759
if you exist, please send someone to teach me about you.

00:17:31.759 --> 00:17:38.039
And 10 minutes later, a witness knocks on the door.

00:17:38.039 --> 00:17:42.039
Coincidence or miracle?

00:17:42.039 --> 00:17:45.039
Another miracle, our Christian brotherhood.

00:17:45.039 --> 00:17:47.039
Isn't it remarkable?

00:17:47.039 --> 00:17:48.039
Who can explain it?

00:17:48.039 --> 00:17:51.039
Former enemies become fast friends.

00:17:51.039 --> 00:17:54.039
You can go to a kingdom hall anywhere in the world,

00:17:54.039 --> 00:17:56.039
and you'll find your brothers and sisters.

00:17:56.039 --> 00:17:58.039
They'll be glad to see you.

00:17:58.039 --> 00:18:00.039
You'll feel at ease.

00:18:00.039 --> 00:18:04.039
You know what they believe and what they'll be studying at the meetings.

00:18:04.039 --> 00:18:08.039
You'll see and feel the love.

00:18:08.039 --> 00:18:11.039
In times of ethnic cleansing,

00:18:11.039 --> 00:18:15.039
how often do we read of brothers and sisters who risk their lives

00:18:15.039 --> 00:18:19.039
to hide fellow believers who happen to be from another tribe?

00:18:19.039 --> 00:18:22.039
You know, when I think of a loving brotherhood,

00:18:22.039 --> 00:18:28.039
I always think of the experience Jack Johansson related in his life story.

00:18:28.039 --> 00:18:31.039
Brother Johansson was a missionary serving in Malawi.

00:18:31.039 --> 00:18:38.039
At a time when the country was experienced in a tremendous political unrest and violence.

00:18:38.039 --> 00:18:42.039
Now he and a young African brother set out to check on the welfare of witnesses

00:18:42.039 --> 00:18:45.039
in another part of the country.

00:18:45.039 --> 00:18:49.039
And along the way, they encountered a soldier who wasn't friendly.

00:18:49.039 --> 00:18:51.039
He said to the African brother,

00:18:51.039 --> 00:18:54.039
I have to shoot the white man.

00:18:54.039 --> 00:18:56.039
He was serious.

00:18:56.039 --> 00:18:58.039
As he raised his gun to fire,

00:18:58.039 --> 00:19:02.039
the young African brother thrust himself between the gunman and brother Johansson

00:19:02.039 --> 00:19:06.039
and said, shoot me, shoot me instead.

00:19:06.039 --> 00:19:10.039
Well, that soldier was so touched by the love of our young African brother

00:19:10.039 --> 00:19:14.039
that he put his gun down.

00:19:14.039 --> 00:19:16.039
When you hear experiences like that,

00:19:16.039 --> 00:19:20.039
it makes you proud to be part of Jehovah's organization.

00:19:20.039 --> 00:19:24.039
And why is it that Jehovah is gathering us into an organization?

00:19:24.039 --> 00:19:30.039
There's an interesting detail recorded at Isaiah 43 and verse 10.

00:19:30.039 --> 00:19:31.039
I'd like you to look it up.

00:19:31.039 --> 00:19:35.039
Now, when you hear Isaiah 43, 10, you say, I know that.

00:19:35.039 --> 00:19:38.039
It's about you who are my witnesses, says Jehovah.

00:19:38.039 --> 00:19:42.039
And that's true, but we're going to focus on another part of the verse.

00:19:42.039 --> 00:19:45.039
So Isaiah 43 and verse 10,

00:19:45.039 --> 00:19:49.289
you are my witnesses, declares Jehovah.

00:19:49.289 --> 00:19:53.289
Yes, my servant whom I have chosen, now notice this,

00:19:53.289 --> 00:19:59.289
so that you may know and have faith in me.

00:19:59.289 --> 00:20:02.289
Before we can have faith in Jehovah,

00:20:02.289 --> 00:20:04.289
we have to get to know Him.

00:20:04.289 --> 00:20:07.289
We have to learn about His powerful works,

00:20:07.289 --> 00:20:10.289
those past and those present.

00:20:10.289 --> 00:20:12.289
And as we study His dealings with His people in the past,

00:20:12.289 --> 00:20:16.289
we see that Jehovah always keeps His promises.

00:20:16.289 --> 00:20:19.289
He's promised to bring about a righteous new world,

00:20:19.289 --> 00:20:22.289
and we can take that promise to the bank.

00:20:22.289 --> 00:20:26.289
And through prayer and association with His organization,

00:20:26.289 --> 00:20:32.289
we can experience the modern day miracles that Jehovah is performing.

00:20:32.289 --> 00:20:37.730
The more we know about Jehovah, the more we'll love Him.

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:41.730
The more we love Him, the more we'll want to tell others about Him.

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:45.730
The more we preach, the stronger our faith will become.

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:52.740
And we will be made powerful by faith.

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:55.740
Thank you, brother, explain for that thrilling review

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:58.740
of Jehovah's powerful works.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:02.740
In the Bible, we read of those who showed faith

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:04.740
while their contemporaries did not.

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.740
Why the difference?

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:09.740
What can we learn from those who showed faith?

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:14.740
Take note of the lessons in the upcoming five-part symposium.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:17.740
Each speaker will introduce the one to follow.

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.740
Brother William Turner, a helper to the service committee,

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:23.740
will deliver the first talk entitled,

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:28.740
imitate the faithful, not the faithless, able, not came.

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:39.369
As humans, we are designed with the ability to imitate

00:21:39.369 --> 00:21:42.369
what we see and hear.

00:21:42.369 --> 00:21:46.369
For example, we learn to talk by imitating the language

00:21:46.369 --> 00:21:48.369
and accent of our parents.

00:21:48.369 --> 00:21:52.369
And as we grew up, we probably also adopted the attitudes

00:21:52.369 --> 00:21:55.369
and actions of people we associated with.

00:21:55.369 --> 00:22:01.369
Clearly, the example of others can have a powerful influence on us.

00:22:01.369 --> 00:22:07.369
Today, more than ever, we need to copy good examples of faith.

00:22:07.369 --> 00:22:09.369
Why?

00:22:09.369 --> 00:22:13.369
Because we are living in a time when our faith will be tested

00:22:13.369 --> 00:22:17.369
in many ways, but not what we will have to do.

00:22:17.369 --> 00:22:21.369
I invite you, please, to turn with me to the book of Jude.

00:22:21.369 --> 00:22:27.369
And follow along as we read verse 20 in the book of Jude.

00:22:27.369 --> 00:22:34.670
It says, but you beloved ones, build yourselves up

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:40.670
on your most holy faith and pray with Holy Spirit.

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:42.670
And I help understand this first.

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:48.670
Think of what a homeowner might do if he knows a really bad storm is approaching.

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:53.670
Likely, he will take steps to build up or strengthen his home,

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:56.670
from repairing cracks in the foundation,

00:22:56.670 --> 00:23:01.670
to reinforcing the doors, walls, and windows.

00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:06.670
Well, in a similar manner, you and I must take steps to build up

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:10.670
or strengthen our faith so that we can protect ourselves

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:14.670
against the onslaught of tests and trials we are likely to face.

00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:19.670
You know, as Jude said, we must continue building ourselves up

00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:25.670
on our most holy faith, which are the Christian teachings found in God's Word.

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:29.670
And as we study God's Word and pray for his help,

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:33.670
we can gain strength by learning from the example set

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:36.670
by different Bible characters.

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:41.670
There is so much that can be learned from the examples of those in ancient times.

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:45.670
Each talk of this symposium will highlight ways in which we can imitate

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:49.670
the faith of Jehovah's loyal servants of the past

00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:53.670
and reject the course of faithless ones.

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:58.670
Let's start by examining the example of Abel.

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:03.670
He was one of the first humans, the fourth, in fact, to exist on earth.

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:07.670
The Bible describes Abel as a righteous man.

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:12.670
He built up a record of living according to Jehovah's standards.

00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:15.670
But his family, however, did not.

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:18.670
We're well familiar with his parents, Adam and Eve.

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:21.670
They both rebelled against Jehovah.

00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:25.670
And as Older Brother Cain, well, he was not a positive role model.

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:30.670
The Bible described Cain as one whose own works were wicked.

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:32.670
So you think about that.

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:37.670
When you look at Adam, Eve, and Cain,

00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:41.670
who all displayed a lack of faith in Jehovah,

00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:47.670
can you imagine what that family dynamic must have been like for Faithful Abel?

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:54.670
The tension, hostility, resentment, lack of spiritual discussions?

00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:57.670
Do you think Abel's faith was tested?

00:24:57.670 --> 00:24:59.670
Indeed it was.

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:02.670
And today, our faith may likewise be tested

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:06.670
by the actions of those who choose not to serve Jehovah.

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:10.920
We invite you to watch the following reenactment.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:14.920
As you do, note how a sister's faith is tested.

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:21.470
I arrived in a new city during the rainy season.

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:24.470
It rained all day every day for a whole month.

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:27.470
At that time, there were only three publishers there.

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:31.470
The first sister I met was my new pioneer partner.

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:36.470
At first, I felt as if the people in this territory spoke a different language.

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:39.470
When I tried to talk to some people about the Bible,

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:43.470
they did not like it, and some were even afraid of these new ideas.

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:49.710
When government officials noticed that we had shared some tracks with the people,

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:53.710
they began to watch us and followed us for about three months.

00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:58.710
I felt overwhelmed by all of this and became very anxious.

00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:02.710
I had few return visits or opportunities to speak about Jehovah.

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:04.710
I felt lost.

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:06.710
I didn't know what to do or where to go.

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:11.710
I often wondered, father, why did you send me here?

00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:14.710
It was like I had gone from being on a mountain peak

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:17.710
to the bottom of a deep valley.

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:22.380
As our sister adjusted to her new circumstances,

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:25.380
did you know how her trials made her feel?

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:30.380
Anxious, lost, and overwhelmed.

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:36.380
Perhaps you've experienced similar feelings when dealing with tests of your faith.

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:41.380
So how can Abel's example of faith help you and me?

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:43.380
Let's notice what he did.

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:45.380
Turn with me please to the book of Hebrews.

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:53.680
And we're going to read Hebrews chapter 11, verse 4.

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:58.339
There we read,

00:26:58.339 --> 00:27:00.339
by faith,

00:27:00.339 --> 00:27:04.339
Abel offered God a sacrifice of greater worth than that of Cain.

00:27:04.339 --> 00:27:06.339
And through that faith,

00:27:06.339 --> 00:27:10.339
he received the witness that he was righteous.

00:27:10.339 --> 00:27:12.339
For God approved his gifts.

00:27:12.339 --> 00:27:14.339
And although he died,

00:27:14.339 --> 00:27:17.339
he still speaks through his faith.

00:27:17.339 --> 00:27:21.940
Abel built strong faith in Jehovah

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:25.940
even though those around him failed to do so.

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:29.940
Let's consider three steps that he took.

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:35.940
First, Abel took time to ponder spiritual matters.

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:37.940
For instance,

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:42.940
he no doubt discerned Jehovah's love and wisdom in creation.

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:44.940
As a shepherd,

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:49.940
perhaps he looked at his sheep and recognized that they needed someone to guide and protect them.

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:51.940
And Abel likely discerned as humans,

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:55.940
we too need someone to guide and protect us.

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:59.940
Someone far wiser and more powerful than any human.

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:03.539
Second step.

00:28:03.539 --> 00:28:08.539
Abel prayed and acted on what he learned.

00:28:08.539 --> 00:28:11.539
Even though his knowledge was limited,

00:28:11.539 --> 00:28:13.539
it was enough.

00:28:13.539 --> 00:28:17.539
Enough for him to act in faith.

00:28:17.539 --> 00:28:21.539
No doubt Abel appealed to Jehovah in prayer to accept his sacrifice.

00:28:21.539 --> 00:28:25.539
And Jehovah approved his gift.

00:28:25.539 --> 00:28:27.539
Abel demonstrated his faith so powerfully.

00:28:27.539 --> 00:28:29.539
Did you know, in verse four,

00:28:29.539 --> 00:28:33.539
it tells us that his example still speaks to us today.

00:28:33.539 --> 00:28:38.849
At times, we may feel that we don't have enough knowledge

00:28:38.849 --> 00:28:42.849
or experience to demonstrate faith like Abel.

00:28:42.849 --> 00:28:44.849
But that's okay.

00:28:44.849 --> 00:28:46.849
It doesn't have to be an obstacle.

00:28:46.849 --> 00:28:50.849
And to Jehovah and make the most of the knowledge that you do have.

00:28:50.849 --> 00:28:52.849
Act in faith.

00:28:52.849 --> 00:28:54.849
And Jehovah will help you.

00:28:54.849 --> 00:28:58.319
The third step.

00:28:58.319 --> 00:29:02.319
Abel remained steadfast when under trial.

00:29:02.319 --> 00:29:06.319
He didn't let the actions of his family affect his faith.

00:29:06.319 --> 00:29:10.319
And we can't let the actions of others affect ours.

00:29:10.319 --> 00:29:15.319
We must never allow something that another person says or does

00:29:15.319 --> 00:29:19.319
to make us feel ashamed of being one of Jehovah's witnesses.

00:29:19.319 --> 00:29:21.319
So be ready.

00:29:21.319 --> 00:29:25.319
Be quick to identify yourself as one of Jehovah's witnesses.

00:29:25.319 --> 00:29:29.319
It will help to build and fortify your faith.

00:29:29.319 --> 00:29:33.319
And we can also learn from the bad example set by King.

00:29:33.319 --> 00:29:36.319
At Genesis chapter four, verses six and seven,

00:29:36.319 --> 00:29:39.319
Jehovah warns King about his attitude

00:29:39.319 --> 00:29:42.319
and he urges him to turn to doing good.

00:29:42.319 --> 00:29:45.319
But just like his faithless parents,

00:29:45.319 --> 00:29:49.319
King determined he knew what was best for himself.

00:29:49.319 --> 00:29:53.319
And his actions led to the murder of his brother.

00:29:53.319 --> 00:29:58.319
We may go through situations where due to imperfection,

00:29:58.319 --> 00:30:00.319
we don't always use the best judgment.

00:30:00.319 --> 00:30:05.319
Or it causes us to develop a negative attitude.

00:30:05.319 --> 00:30:08.319
But when the matter is brought to our attention,

00:30:08.319 --> 00:30:11.319
how will we respond?

00:30:12.319 --> 00:30:15.319
You see, let's not imitate the faithless example of Cain.

00:30:15.319 --> 00:30:19.319
Let's not feel that we always know what's best.

00:30:19.319 --> 00:30:23.319
But let's see that warning as a loving tap on the shoulder

00:30:23.319 --> 00:30:25.319
from our Heavenly Father.

00:30:25.319 --> 00:30:30.319
And allow it to readjust our thinking so that we can build our faith

00:30:30.319 --> 00:30:34.599
and preserve our relationship with Him.

00:30:34.599 --> 00:30:37.599
Well, let's now go back to our sister.

00:30:37.599 --> 00:30:42.599
In the following reenactment, note how she imitates Abel's faith.

00:30:42.599 --> 00:30:50.609
I studied the Bible to see how Jehovah cared for his servants in the past.

00:30:50.609 --> 00:30:54.609
For example, I read how Jehovah told Jacob throughout his life,

00:30:54.609 --> 00:30:57.609
I will be with you wherever you go.

00:30:57.609 --> 00:31:00.609
I pictured Jehovah telling me the same thing.

00:31:00.609 --> 00:31:03.609
Don't worry, just go.

00:31:03.609 --> 00:31:06.609
And I will always be there to help you.

00:31:06.609 --> 00:31:10.609
I begged him to help me to be balanced, to feel peace,

00:31:10.609 --> 00:31:13.609
and to have courage to go out in the ministry.

00:31:13.609 --> 00:31:17.609
One day, Jehovah helped me to find a very good Bible student.

00:31:17.609 --> 00:31:22.609
It was an absolutely wonderful and unexpected gift from Jehovah.

00:31:22.609 --> 00:31:25.609
Our small group joins congregation meetings through the Internet.

00:31:25.609 --> 00:31:29.609
This arrangement is a valuable source of spiritual food for me.

00:31:29.609 --> 00:31:33.609
We get together for meals and association as well.

00:31:33.609 --> 00:31:38.609
The experiences on JW Broadcasting make me feel that I am not alone.

00:31:38.609 --> 00:31:41.609
And I always smile and wake by at the end.

00:31:41.609 --> 00:31:43.609
It's wonderful to be here.

00:31:43.609 --> 00:31:50.970
Did you notice how our sister built up her faith in Jehovah?

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:54.970
She imitated Abel's example and she followed those steps.

00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:58.970
The first step, she pondered on spiritual matters.

00:31:58.970 --> 00:32:02.970
She studied the Bible to see how Jehovah cared for his servants in the past.

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:07.970
And then she applied what she learned to her situation.

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:13.970
Then the second step, she prayed and acted on what she learned.

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:18.970
Her prayer was that Jehovah helped her to be balanced, to feel peace,

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:22.970
and to have courage to go into the ministry.

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:25.970
And then she acted in faith.

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:30.970
And despite the challenges in the ministry, she took the third step.

00:32:30.970 --> 00:32:33.970
She remained steadfast under trial.

00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:36.970
She persevered and was blessed with a study.

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:41.970
And then she reinforced her faith by joining in congregation meetings

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:45.970
and benefiting from the wholesome association of the Brotherhood.

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:47.970
And what was the result?

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:50.970
Jehovah blessed her efforts.

00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:55.970
And if you and I follow these steps, he will bless our efforts as well.

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:59.970
By utilizing this tremendous gift, Jehovah has given us

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:02.970
the power of example.

00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:04.970
You and I can imitate Abel.

00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:07.970
And as we build and fortify our faith,

00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:12.970
we will weather any storm of adversity that comes our way.

00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:17.470
For the Gary Bro, a helper to the service committee,

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:20.470
will now present the next talk of this symposium.

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:26.470
Imitate the faithful, not the faithless, enoch, not lamek.

00:33:34.099 --> 00:33:37.099
Without warning, our faith could suddenly be tested

00:33:37.099 --> 00:33:41.099
by how we react in a violent encounter.

00:33:41.099 --> 00:33:46.099
Yes, our faith may be tested as enoch's was.

00:33:46.099 --> 00:33:50.099
Ungodliness and violence were commonplace before the flood,

00:33:50.099 --> 00:33:55.099
and the scriptures clearly indicate how people reacted.

00:33:55.099 --> 00:34:00.099
We are told that the faithful man, enoch, chose to walk with God.

00:34:00.099 --> 00:34:05.099
So when he was threatened, he looked to Jehovah for security.

00:34:05.099 --> 00:34:09.099
On the other hand, lamek, a descendant of the murderer Cain,

00:34:09.099 --> 00:34:13.099
opted to provide his own security.

00:34:13.099 --> 00:34:17.099
This led to killing a man in supposed self-defense.

00:34:17.099 --> 00:34:23.099
Now, enoch and the killer lamek both lived in a violent world,

00:34:23.099 --> 00:34:29.099
but their violence reaction plans were totally different.

00:34:29.099 --> 00:34:32.099
As we descend deeper into the last days,

00:34:32.099 --> 00:34:38.099
people will become more desperate and violence will only escalate.

00:34:38.099 --> 00:34:40.099
In the following dramatization,

00:34:40.099 --> 00:34:44.099
let's see how reacting to violence could suddenly become

00:34:44.099 --> 00:34:47.099
a personal test of faith in Jehovah.

00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:30.829
My son barely escaped the gangs.

00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:39.579
Again, we're the only ones without a gun

00:35:39.579 --> 00:35:45.460
want to keep a gun for protection.

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:53.260
But how else can I protect my family?

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:59.260
In today's violent society, even in the perceived safest of neighborhoods,

00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:02.260
we could have a similar experience.

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:06.260
If so, how can we imitate enoch's faith?

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:11.260
For one thing, he recognized a simple but fundamental truth,

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:15.260
Jehovah hates violence.

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:19.260
So for us to walk with God as enoch did,

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:23.260
we must reject violence as an option.

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:26.260
What can help us to do that?

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:29.260
Don't harbor retaliatory thoughts.

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:36.260
Violence thoughts can lead to violent actions without thinking about the consequences.

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:40.260
Learn to recognize situations that could harm us,

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:42.260
then act to avoid the danger.

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:47.260
That's the council given at Proverbs 22 and verse 3.

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:54.440
The shrewd one sees the danger and conceals himself,

00:36:54.440 --> 00:37:00.440
but the inexperience keeps right on going and suffer the consequences.

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:05.440
So we're encouraged to conceal ourselves if we sense danger.

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:08.440
Think ahead, look around, be perceptive,

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:12.440
and avoid situations that may become violent.

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:16.750
Avoid violent entertainment.

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:18.750
Why?

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:24.750
It frequently portrays a violent response when a character's safety is threatened.

00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:29.750
All sorts of objects or weapons are depicted as strategies

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:34.750
to kill or overpower the opponents.

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:40.750
While Christians may take reasonable steps to ensure their personal security,

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:45.750
they do so within the framework of Bible principles.

00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:52.750
Consider these three scriptures as you make decisions about your family's security needs.

00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:56.750
David prayed at Psalm 51-14,

00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:59.750
save me from blood guilt.

00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:03.750
He never wanted to be guilty of murder.

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:10.750
Preparing a response that includes the use of weapons could result in taking a life.

00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:15.750
If a Christian takes reasonable steps to defend himself or his property,

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:22.750
he would do everything in his power to avoid taking a human life and become blood guilty.

00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:33.739
In Matthew 2652, Jesus warned that those who draw the sword shall die by the sword.

00:38:33.739 --> 00:38:36.739
It's well established that when weapons are displayed,

00:38:36.739 --> 00:38:41.739
situations usually escalate with tragic outcomes.

00:38:41.739 --> 00:38:50.369
Planning to use a deadly weapon could effectively dismiss Jehovah's spirit from our presence.

00:38:50.369 --> 00:38:58.369
To pull away from Jehovah is the last thing we want to do in a dangerous situation.

00:38:58.369 --> 00:39:03.369
A third is found at Ecclesiastes 918, where it simply says,

00:39:03.369 --> 00:39:06.369
Wisdom is better than weapons.

00:39:06.369 --> 00:39:11.369
In other words, being armed cannot match Wisdom.

00:39:11.369 --> 00:39:17.369
The prudent course is to trust in Jehovah, not weapons.

00:39:17.369 --> 00:39:26.369
God's word wisely teaches us to daily show respect, consideration, and genuine kindness to others.

00:39:26.369 --> 00:39:33.369
This approach of pursuing peace will often minimize otherwise potential conflicts.

00:39:33.369 --> 00:39:40.369
Isn't it true? Violence struggles often begin with a heated exchange of words.

00:39:40.369 --> 00:39:48.369
So calmness can often diffuse anger and deflect violent conflicts.

00:39:48.369 --> 00:39:51.369
Here's something else to consider.

00:39:51.369 --> 00:39:57.369
The Bible book of Jude says that Enoch prophesied to his opposers.

00:39:57.369 --> 00:40:03.369
His means that he was a preacher, being known as a courageous witness of Jehovah,

00:40:03.369 --> 00:40:11.369
and showing compassion for those to whom we preach is always our best protection.

00:40:11.369 --> 00:40:15.369
How was Enoch rewarded for putting his faith in Jehovah?

00:40:15.369 --> 00:40:20.369
Note the answer at Hebrews 11 and verse 5.

00:40:20.369 --> 00:40:29.110
By faith, Enoch was transferred so as not to see death,

00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:33.110
and he was nowhere to be found because God had transferred him.

00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:41.110
Before he was transferred, he received the witness that he had pleased God well.

00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:46.110
Enoch was rewarded with the knowledge that he had pleased God well.

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:53.110
In some manner, in a very clear way, he was given assurance of Jehovah's approval.

00:40:53.110 --> 00:41:00.110
How comforting to know that if we face dangerous encounters with no good way out,

00:41:00.110 --> 00:41:08.110
like Enoch, we too can handle that test of faith in a way that will please God well.

00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:15.110
In the following dramatization, note how our brother imitates Enoch's example.

00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:20.929
Hebrews 11, verse 1.

00:41:20.929 --> 00:41:24.929
Faith is the assured expectation of what is hope for.

00:41:24.929 --> 00:41:30.929
I do have faith in God's promises, but if a gun is what I need to protect my family,

00:41:30.929 --> 00:41:33.929
won't Jehovah understand?

00:42:12.019 --> 00:42:20.579
No, I couldn't do that.

00:42:20.579 --> 00:42:24.579
I'm not the first to face a violent world.

00:42:24.579 --> 00:42:27.579
Hebrews 11.5.

00:42:27.579 --> 00:42:31.579
Received the witness that he had pleased God well.

00:42:31.579 --> 00:42:36.579
Enoch lived among extreme violence, but he walked with God.

00:42:36.579 --> 00:42:58.559
I can imitate his faith.

00:42:58.559 --> 00:43:02.559
Did you notice this brother's violence reaction plan?

00:43:02.559 --> 00:43:09.559
His faith in God's promises helped him to look to Jehovah for security instead of a gun.

00:43:09.559 --> 00:43:18.559
He realized he was not the first to face a violent world and made the firm decision to imitate the faith of Enoch.

00:43:18.559 --> 00:43:29.559
So now, prior to a violent confrontation, what can we do to be sure our reaction plan will be pleasing to Jehovah?

00:43:29.559 --> 00:43:32.559
Imitate Enoch in these four ways.

00:43:32.559 --> 00:43:40.559
Build our faith and confidence in Jehovah now before we are tested in a violent situation.

00:43:40.559 --> 00:43:43.559
Reject violent thoughts.

00:43:43.559 --> 00:43:56.559
Don't allow the violent movies or violent video games that are sponsored by the devil to train your children or yourselves on how to react in a violent confrontation.

00:43:57.559 --> 00:44:07.559
Reject the idea that you will prepare yourselves with weapons and fearlessly keep preaching as Enoch did.

00:44:07.559 --> 00:44:22.559
In this way, even if we find ourselves in a violent situation, our violence reaction plan will allow us to imitate Enoch and please God well.

00:44:22.559 --> 00:44:42.469
The John Echron, a helper to the coordinators committee, will now consider the next talk of this symposium, imitate the faithful, not the faithless, Noah, not his neighbors.

00:44:42.469 --> 00:44:46.469
Jesus compared our days with the days of Noah.

00:44:46.469 --> 00:44:53.469
Jesus would know because he was in heaven and watched the days of Noah go from bad to worse.

00:44:53.469 --> 00:44:56.469
Well, how bad were the days of Noah?

00:44:56.469 --> 00:45:00.469
Let's look at Genesis chapter 6 and verse 5 for a description.

00:45:00.469 --> 00:45:15.679
Consequently, Jehovah saw that man's wickedness was great on the earth and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only bad all the time.

00:45:15.679 --> 00:45:25.679
The wickedness on the earth was made worse by wicked angels that abandoned their role in heaven and materialized human bodies to marry women on earth.

00:45:25.679 --> 00:45:30.679
These unholy marriages produced sons that were giants called Nephilim.

00:45:30.679 --> 00:45:42.019
Now, parents, you imagine what it must have been like for Noah and his wife to raise a family in that ungodly world?

00:45:42.019 --> 00:45:46.019
But you don't really need to imagine it, do you?

00:45:46.019 --> 00:45:56.019
Just one look around us and we can all see that we live in a world that fits the same description if not worse than the days of Noah.

00:45:57.019 --> 00:46:07.019
Just as Noah's faith was tested, your faith will likely be tested too as you raise a family in this ungodly world.

00:46:07.019 --> 00:46:20.019
Please, do not allow the pressures at work from relatives or others, make you think the material things are more important than your family's relationship with Jehovah.

00:46:20.019 --> 00:46:27.019
You can remain faithful by imitating Noah, not his neighbors.

00:46:27.019 --> 00:46:33.019
In the following dramatization, note how a parent's faith is tested.

00:46:33.019 --> 00:46:46.380
Another busy day, my daughter is going to preach, I'm off to work and it's family worship night.

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:49.380
Bye, Dad. Have a good day, sweetie.

00:46:49.380 --> 00:47:00.869
All right, listen up. I got an announcement for everybody.

00:47:00.869 --> 00:47:04.869
What? More required over time?

00:47:04.869 --> 00:47:07.869
Okay, that's it. It's all I got. Let's get back to work.

00:47:07.869 --> 00:47:12.869
It's extra money, but how can I do it and take care of Regina?

00:47:12.869 --> 00:47:30.710
Isn't it family worship night?

00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:34.019
Maybe a little later, sweetie.

00:47:34.019 --> 00:47:43.860
I wanted to, but I was spent again.

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:53.199
Our brother knew it was family worship night, but extra work, the pressures of life were dragging him down.

00:47:53.199 --> 00:47:55.199
His faith was being tested.

00:47:55.199 --> 00:47:59.199
Would he imitate Noah or his neighbors?

00:47:59.199 --> 00:48:04.199
Noah's neighbors lacked faith. They did not do what was needed to save their families.

00:48:04.199 --> 00:48:11.199
Instead, Jesus said they were so distracted by their daily lives, eating and drinking, getting married,

00:48:11.199 --> 00:48:17.199
that they took no note until the flood came and took them all away.

00:48:17.199 --> 00:48:21.199
In contrast, Noah took note.

00:48:21.199 --> 00:48:25.199
Noah acted in faith to save his household.

00:48:25.199 --> 00:48:31.199
Look at the beautiful description of Noah's faith in Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 7.

00:48:31.199 --> 00:48:44.059
By faith, Noah, after receiving divine warning of things not yet seen, showed godly fear and constructed an ark for the saving of his household.

00:48:44.059 --> 00:48:53.059
And through this faith, he condemned the world, and he became an heir of the righteousness that results from faith.

00:48:53.059 --> 00:49:00.030
Noah's actions saved his household.

00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:09.030
We can be sure it was not always easy for Noah to explain to his sons why they were building an ark and no one else was,

00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:14.030
or why building it was more important than anything else they had to do.

00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:17.030
His three boys would have seen the Nephilim.

00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:25.030
Noah and his wife could hardly have shielded their boys from all the stories that circulated about those giants.

00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:30.030
Imagine some of the discussions that Noah and his wife had with their boys.

00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:40.030
The materialized wicked angels and their Nephilim sons were men of fame and admired by everyone for their superhuman capabilities.

00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:48.030
Even today, people are fascinated with stories and movies of humans with superpowers.

00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:57.030
But those wicked angels and their sons the Nephilim were nothing to be admired or imitated.

00:49:57.030 --> 00:50:02.030
Noah taught his sons not to admire or copy them.

00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:09.030
They had to help their boys see that Jehovah felt hurt by the violence and rebellion in the world.

00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:15.380
The boys needed to learn to love Jehovah and imitate him.

00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:24.380
And take the time to teach your children to hate what Jehovah hates and to love what Jehovah loves.

00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:30.380
Jehovah hates liars, cheaters, bullies, selfishness, and greed.

00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:39.099
On the other hand, Jehovah loves honesty, peace, love, sharing, and self-control.

00:50:39.099 --> 00:50:47.099
Noah, like any good father, wanted to make sure his family had a comfortable place to live and good food to eat.

00:50:47.099 --> 00:50:51.099
Think of the houses that Noah and his sons could have built from themselves.

00:50:51.099 --> 00:50:58.099
They certainly had the construction experience. But that was not Noah's focus.

00:50:58.099 --> 00:51:05.420
Noah's life had more meaning and purpose than building houses, eating and drinking.

00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:13.420
Noah taught by example and kept his focus on saving his household from the coming flood.

00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:22.820
He likely had at times when he felt tired or overwhelmed with the sheer size and scope of building an ark.

00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:29.820
However, Noah did not allow his day-to-day life to crowd out his service to Jehovah.

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:39.070
He made sure that no matter what else was happening in his life, that the work of building the ark kept moving forward.

00:51:39.070 --> 00:51:46.070
Our brother we saw in the video, he was tired and overwhelmed by his work and job.

00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:52.070
All of us can identify with how he feels. Life in this system is hard.

00:51:52.070 --> 00:52:02.070
We appreciate the hard work and effort that you parents are making to keep a good spiritual routine for your family.

00:52:02.070 --> 00:52:11.070
We know how tempting it can be to say, well, we'll study later or we'll pick it up again next week.

00:52:11.070 --> 00:52:14.070
See the danger.

00:52:14.070 --> 00:52:24.070
Putting off our spiritual routine this week can easily lead to three weeks and then six weeks and then not at all.

00:52:24.070 --> 00:52:30.420
Jehovah took care of Noah and his family's material needs.

00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:38.420
So you can be confident that Jehovah will take care of you and your family. He will bless you for your obedience.

00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:44.420
In the following dramatization, note how our brother imitates Noah's faith.

00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:53.400
The world is such a mess. It's everything Jesus said it would be.

00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:58.400
She's so good, spiritually minded like her mother was.

00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:54.780
Can I expect she'll stay that way on her own?

00:53:54.780 --> 00:54:06.340
If it is just like Noah's day, I need to show faith like he did.

00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:11.199
Let's do our family worship.

00:54:11.199 --> 00:54:18.199
I need to show faith in Jehovah and work hard to save my family.

00:54:18.199 --> 00:54:27.869
Did you notice how our brother acted in faith?

00:54:27.869 --> 00:54:37.869
Our brother imagined what could happen to his daughter if she lost her spirituality and adopted the lifestyle of the world.

00:54:38.869 --> 00:54:46.869
What he saw really scared him. He immediately turned off the TV and joined his daughter for family worship.

00:54:46.869 --> 00:54:58.440
Noah knew that building the ark would save his family from the coming flood, but only if they were in the ark with him.

00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:04.440
He did not want to see his sons adopt the lifestyle of his neighbors.

00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:13.440
Noah did everything he could to make sure that he taught his sons to love Jehovah by his words and his actions.

00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:23.550
Parents, by imitating Noah, you can save both yourself and your family.

00:55:23.550 --> 00:55:43.619
Brother Seth Hyatt, a helper with the service committee, will now consider the next talk of this symposium, imitate the faithful, not the faithless, Moses, not Pharaoh.

00:55:43.619 --> 00:55:54.619
For almost 40 years, Moses enjoyed a life of comfort and privilege as the adopted son of Pharaoh's daughter.

00:55:54.619 --> 00:56:06.619
Among the advantages, material prosperity, and advanced education, how might those advantages have affected Moses' outlook?

00:56:06.619 --> 00:56:15.619
We gained some insight from an incident that took place when Moses was 80 years of age. It's recorded in Exodus, chapter 5.

00:56:15.619 --> 00:56:21.619
There in a conversation with the Pharaoh, the Pharaoh is reported to have said to Moses,

00:56:21.619 --> 00:56:27.619
Who is Jehovah that I should obey his voice? I do not know Jehovah at all.

00:56:27.619 --> 00:56:44.619
No truer words have ever been spoken. That Pharaoh did not know Jehovah, and as a result had no faith in him. He was faithless. His haughty words, dismissive of Jehovah.

00:56:44.619 --> 00:56:50.619
No doubt reflected the Egyptian belief that the Pharaoh was himself a God.

00:56:50.619 --> 00:56:59.619
Was Moses' outlook affected in a negative way by that Egyptian culture? No.

00:56:59.619 --> 00:57:12.619
We see a refreshing contrast. Moses was a humble man, a man of faith, who at the age of 40 made a decision that reflected the depth of that faith,

00:57:12.619 --> 00:57:21.619
and that changed his life forever. Why should you and I be interested in Moses' example of faith?

00:57:21.619 --> 00:57:33.619
Because like Moses, we face situations that require choices, decisions that reflect the quality of our faith.

00:57:33.619 --> 00:57:43.869
For example, note how an elder faces a test of his faith in the following dramatization.

00:57:43.869 --> 00:58:13.239
Danny is going to look after the business while we're away. I only scheduled a few small jobs. I'm sure he can handle it.

00:58:13.239 --> 00:58:25.730
It's our sign convention, and I planned as best I could for us to go together. But some things, you just can't see coming.

00:58:25.730 --> 00:58:27.730
Hello?

00:58:27.730 --> 00:58:47.230
Danny was in a panic. He got trouble calls from my two biggest accounts. It was bad. I can't lose their business.

00:58:47.230 --> 00:58:57.230
For just a few minutes, let's consider what the scriptures have to say about Moses' faith and consider four ways that we can imitate him.

00:58:57.230 --> 00:59:08.639
Turn please to Hebrews chapter 11. And we're going to begin reading in verse 24. Hebrews 11, 24.

00:59:08.639 --> 00:59:25.639
By faith, Moses, when grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, choosing to be mistreated with the people of God rather than to have the temporary enjoyment of sin.

00:59:25.639 --> 00:59:34.639
So the first thing that Moses did, he rejected the proud selfish thinking of that Egyptian world.

00:59:34.639 --> 00:59:46.639
He chose to be mistreated with the Israelites who were slaves rather than to align himself with a culture that dismissed Jehovah.

00:59:46.639 --> 00:59:57.079
What prompted that decision? The opening words of verse 24 tell us Moses was a man of faith.

00:59:57.079 --> 01:00:09.079
And his faith shaped his decisions, not his culture, not community pressure, his faith. And that's our second point.

01:00:09.079 --> 01:00:25.489
Now let's continue reading in verse 26. Because he considered the reproach of the Christ to be riches greater than the treasures of Egypt, for he looked intently toward the payment of the reward.

01:00:25.489 --> 01:00:41.280
Moses received an assignment, a commission from Jehovah. And he viewed that commission as more valuable than anything that Egypt had to offer.

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:51.280
He turned his back on the comforts of Egypt and aligned himself with Jehovah and the outworking of Jehovah's purpose.

01:00:51.280 --> 01:01:03.280
Our third point. He had clear spiritual vision. He looked intently toward the payment of the reward. Moses could see outside the Egypt box.

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:11.280
And he could see the fulfillment of Jehovah's wonderful promises to Abraham and Abraham's descendants.

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:29.280
The spiritual vision is committed on further in verse 27. By faith, he left Egypt, but not fearing the anger of the king, for he continued steadfast as Seahin, the one who was invisible.

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:44.280
Yes, Moses could see the Pharaoh, but with his clear spiritual vision, he could see Jehovah. Moses had an unbreakable friendship with Jehovah. So can you.

01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:52.280
The quality of any friendship can be measured by the quality of communication that characterizes it.

01:01:52.280 --> 01:02:03.280
Regular heartfelt prayer and meaningful study of the Bible constitute two-way communication between an individual and Jehovah.

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:16.280
As we get to know Jehovah better and better as our faith strengthens and deepens, then our decisions reflect that faith.

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:27.280
And in our words and actions we give evidence of that faith. And that brings us to the fourth point.

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:41.280
In the opening words of verse 27, by faith, Moses left Egypt. His faith was of such quality that it evidenced in his words and his actions.

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:51.280
True, Moses was a man of action. He left Egypt, but he was also a man who expressed his convictions.

01:02:51.280 --> 01:03:07.280
When Moses and the Israelites stood on the shore of the Red Sea with Pharaoh and his armies behind them and the Red Sea in front of them, and seemingly nowhere to go, how did Moses strengthen the people?

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:20.559
Do not be afraid. Stand still and see the salvation of Jehovah. Those words must have strengthened the Israelites.

01:03:20.559 --> 01:03:37.559
In a similar way, we can strengthen those around us, whether in the preaching work in our dealings with our family or with others, when our faith is voiced and evidenced in the things that we say and do.

01:03:37.559 --> 01:03:54.559
We're a blessing to those around us. Of course, it's important that we stay humble as Moses did, ever receptive to Jehovah's direction and counsel that he provides through his word and his organization.

01:03:54.559 --> 01:04:07.670
Now, how about that elder who we met earlier? Let's look in and see how he imitates Moses in making a decision.

01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:15.340
Okay, just find the parts and I'll call you back. This will take our weekend.

01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:19.340
You want us to go? Will you get the program later?

01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:27.969
Yeah, and I'll have to text John that I can't be an attendant. But what will I miss that I can't get later?

01:04:28.969 --> 01:04:41.750
In Hebrews 11 verse 26 it says,

01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:54.750
Moses considered the reproach of the Christ to be riches greater than the treasures of Egypt, for he looked intently toward the payment of the reward.

01:04:54.750 --> 01:05:02.280
Of what value is being a prince of Egypt compared with me?

01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:05.280
Honey, what do you think?

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:25.690
Nanny? Yeah, here's what I want you to do for now, and we'll pick up the pieces when I get back.

01:05:25.690 --> 01:05:31.690
Did you notice how the elder made a decision based on his faith?

01:05:31.690 --> 01:05:41.690
With his eyes of faith, he could see the blessings that he and his family would enjoy if they attended the convention together.

01:05:42.690 --> 01:05:46.690
And he made a decision as a spiritual man.

01:05:46.690 --> 01:05:57.690
In a similar way, if we imitate Moses rejecting the proud selfish thinking of the world and allowing our decisions to be shaped by our faith,

01:05:57.690 --> 01:06:06.690
not by culture or community pressure, if we maintain clear spiritual vision and if our faith is evidenced in our words and actions,

01:06:06.690 --> 01:06:17.690
then we can be confident of Jehovah's support and his hand of salvation in our behalf just as he did for Moses.

01:06:17.690 --> 01:06:24.690
Brother Robert Soranco, a helper to the writing committee, will consider the final talk of this symposium.

01:06:24.690 --> 01:06:32.690
imitate the faithful, not the faithless. Jesus disciples, not the Pharisees.

01:06:32.690 --> 01:06:43.440
Jesus called them serpents, offspring of vipers.

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:48.440
Who is he talking about? The Pharisees. And who were they?

01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:52.440
A prominent Jewish religious sect in the first century.

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:55.440
Why was Jesus so critical of them?

01:06:56.440 --> 01:07:04.440
Because even though those religious leaders had knowledge of God and prided themselves in their strict adherence to the law of Moses,

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:13.440
they did not do as Moses had said to listen to the future Savior that Jehovah would raise up for his people.

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:16.440
That Savior is Jesus Christ.

01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:23.440
But when the Pharisees saw him miraculously curing the sick, lame and blind, even resurrecting the dead,

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:29.440
they did not rejoice over that and glorify God for what he was performing through Christ.

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:36.440
The Pharisees were faithless and they refused to believe in and listen to God's Son.

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:43.440
Instead, they persecuted Jesus to disciples because they did put faith in the Christ.

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:49.440
So Jesus exposed the Pharisees for what they were and called them serpents,

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:55.440
because of the deadly spiritual harm that they inflicted on others who were influenced by them.

01:07:55.440 --> 01:08:04.440
In fact, the Pharisees exerted such great influence over the people that prominent persons were afraid to confess openly their faith in Jesus

01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:11.440
for fear of being expelled from their positions in the synagogue and losing faith in the community.

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:18.439
Can the same sort of fear hold people back today from serving Jehovah as a disciple of God's Son,

01:08:18.439 --> 01:08:25.439
fearing the rejection or ridicule they might have to endure from neighbors, friends or family?

01:08:25.439 --> 01:08:30.439
If it is, how can you imitate Jesus' disciples?

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:37.439
They not only knew about God, but they trusted in Him as their reliable father and friend.

01:08:37.439 --> 01:08:45.439
As proof of that, they went right onto the temple grounds in Jerusalem in full view of everyone and gave a bold witness about God's Son.

01:08:45.439 --> 01:08:49.439
They were powerful by their faith.

01:08:49.439 --> 01:08:55.439
When the Jewish High Court, many members of which were Pharisees heard about this, they were furious.

01:08:55.439 --> 01:08:59.439
They ordered the disciples to stop teaching about Jesus.

01:08:59.439 --> 01:09:04.439
What did they do? Coward and fear? No.

01:09:04.439 --> 01:09:09.439
We can read what happened at Acts 5, verse 29.

01:09:09.439 --> 01:09:13.439
That's Acts 5, verse 29.

01:09:13.439 --> 01:09:15.439
It reports,

01:09:15.439 --> 01:09:19.439
In answer, Peter and the other apostles said,

01:09:19.439 --> 01:09:23.439
we must obey God as ruler rather than men.

01:09:23.439 --> 01:09:30.689
Jesus' disciples did not allow the religious leaders' pressure and threats to deter them.

01:09:30.689 --> 01:09:38.689
They knew their priorities and the situations would arise when a Christian cannot obey both men and Jehovah God.

01:09:38.689 --> 01:09:47.689
You see, human rulers forfeit their right to our obedience when they demand what Almighty God prohibits,

01:09:47.689 --> 01:09:54.689
or, as in this case, when they prohibit what God requires of us.

01:09:55.689 --> 01:10:02.689
Even if they ban our preaching work, we cannot stop carrying out our God-given assignment to preach the good news.

01:10:02.689 --> 01:10:06.689
So, at that very moment,

01:10:06.689 --> 01:10:15.689
the apostles set a precedent for all true Christians throughout the ages to obey God as ruler first.

01:10:15.689 --> 01:10:19.689
The disciples' faith made them real friends of Jehovah.

01:10:19.689 --> 01:10:26.689
And as a result, today they are alive and well in heaven with Jesus to serve with Him as kings and priests.

01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:31.689
And what of those faithless Pharisees and their coveted prominence?

01:10:31.689 --> 01:10:36.689
Jesus told them to their face what fate lay ahead of them.

01:10:36.689 --> 01:10:41.689
As recorded at Matthew, chapter 23, verse 33,

01:10:41.689 --> 01:10:46.689
Matthew 23, verse 33,

01:10:46.689 --> 01:10:54.689
He told them, serpents, offspring of vipers, how will you flee from the judgment of Gohanna?

01:10:54.689 --> 01:11:02.689
Now, the judgment of Gohanna meant that if they did not change, they would be everlastingly destroyed.

01:11:02.689 --> 01:11:09.689
If we are going to imitate the disciples' faith, we must do as Jesus urged as followers.

01:11:09.689 --> 01:11:16.689
See what He said at Matthew, chapter 6, and verse 33,

01:11:16.689 --> 01:11:27.189
keep on then seeking first the kingdom and His righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you.

01:11:27.189 --> 01:11:32.189
So, Jesus' disciples must always make the kingdom their first concern in life.

01:11:32.189 --> 01:11:40.189
If we do that, then as Jesus promised, Jehovah will see to it that we have the material and spiritual necessities of life.

01:11:41.189 --> 01:11:49.189
Now, seeking the kingdom first in our life includes preaching the good news of the kingdom to as many people as we can.

01:11:49.189 --> 01:11:57.189
As with Jesus' disciples, it requires courage and boldness to preach when neighbors, friends, or family opposes.

01:11:57.189 --> 01:12:08.189
But we do not need to fear them or any other religious enemies, because Jesus taught His disciples how to preach boldly but discreetly.

01:12:08.189 --> 01:12:19.189
You can see this at Matthew, chapter 10, and verse 16, Matthew 10, 16.

01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:31.189
He said, look, I am sending you out a sheep among wolves, so prove yourselves cautious as serpents, and yet innocent as does.

01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:41.189
It seems that most literal snakes would rather flee than attack, so to be cautious here means to be prudent, sensible, shrewd.

01:12:41.189 --> 01:12:47.189
Now, the dove is known as the sheep of the bird world, because of its gentle appearance and disposition.

01:12:47.189 --> 01:12:53.189
So, to be innocent means being blameless, genuine, with pure motives.

01:12:53.189 --> 01:13:07.189
Jesus' point was that when his sheep-like disciples face persecution, they need to combine the characteristics of being cautious and innocent to avoid possible dangers as they carry out their preaching work.

01:13:07.189 --> 01:13:19.189
For example, suppose colleagues at work, schoolmates, or even members of your own family make caustic remarks about your beliefs as a witness of Jehovah.

01:13:19.189 --> 01:13:30.189
Instead of responding in kind by being equally sarcastic about their faith, show them that their comments have no effect on your peace and your pleasant demeanor.

01:13:30.189 --> 01:13:36.189
That's being prudent and blameless, cautious, yet innocent.

01:13:36.189 --> 01:13:42.189
We all need to keep imitating the faith of Jesus' disciples.

01:13:43.189 --> 01:13:46.189
Well, what have we learned from this symposium?

01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:58.189
Two things. First, we must reject the course of faithless ones, like Cain, Lamek, Noah's neighbors, Pharaoh, and the Pharisees.

01:13:58.189 --> 01:14:09.189
Second, we need to imitate Jehovah's Faithful Servants, like Abel, Enek, Noah, Moses, and Jesus' disciples.

01:14:09.189 --> 01:14:17.630
If we do, then we can enjoy living forever as a friend of Jehovah.

01:14:17.630 --> 01:14:26.630
Thank you, brothers. We are determined to imitate the good examples you discussed, especially when our faith is tested.

01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:31.630
We now come to the final talk of today's program.

01:14:31.630 --> 01:14:38.630
Why do we regularly need to examine our lives and our worship? In what ways should we do so?

01:14:38.630 --> 01:14:44.630
Brother Jeffrey Jackson of the governing body will direct us to the Bible's answer.

01:14:44.630 --> 01:14:50.630
His theme is, keep testing whether you are in the faith. How?

01:14:50.630 --> 01:15:03.829
Do you own a car or a motorbike or some other type of vehicle?

01:15:03.829 --> 01:15:09.829
If you do, you realize that it brings with it a serious responsibility.

01:15:09.829 --> 01:15:17.829
Initially, it costs quite a bit of money to buy a vehicle, but also you need to keep on spending money to keep it running.

01:15:17.829 --> 01:15:24.829
In addition to that, there is another serious responsibility that comes with owning a vehicle.

01:15:24.829 --> 01:15:37.829
And that is the responsibility to maintain it safely, so that it doesn't break down, doesn't cause accidents, and most importantly, doesn't cause loss of life.

01:15:38.829 --> 01:15:56.829
Of course, if you have a maintenance program, you're not just going to wait for something to fall off the vehicle, or perhaps for it just to stop, but rather ahead of time, you have to have a checklist to see that everything is working properly.

01:15:56.829 --> 01:16:06.829
Well, in a similar way, spiritually speaking, each one of us needs a maintenance program with regard to our spirituality.

01:16:06.829 --> 01:16:09.829
What sort of maintenance program are we talking about?

01:16:09.829 --> 01:16:18.829
Well, let's take our Bibles, please, and turn to the second book of Corinthians, chapter 13 and verse 5.

01:16:18.829 --> 01:16:24.829
Second Corinthians, chapter 13 and verse 5.

01:16:24.829 --> 01:16:30.829
There it says, keep testing whether you are in the faith.

01:16:30.829 --> 01:16:42.829
Keep proving what you yourselves are, or do you not recognize that Jesus Christ is in union with you, unless you are disapproved.

01:16:42.829 --> 01:16:49.829
So notice right in the beginning of that verse, it says, keep testing, keep proving.

01:16:49.829 --> 01:16:52.829
What does that really mean?

01:16:52.829 --> 01:16:58.829
Well, if you look at the study note associated with verse 5, it tells us this.

01:16:58.829 --> 01:17:09.829
One lexicon states that the word Paul here uses for testing means to endeavour to discover the nature or character of something.

01:17:09.829 --> 01:17:21.829
They could discover the nature of their own spiritual standing by comparing their daily conduct, attitudes and decisions with the sacred truths they were taught.

01:17:21.829 --> 01:17:27.829
Doing such testing would help them to keep proving that they were true Christians.

01:17:27.829 --> 01:17:37.829
For proving, Paul uses a word that could refer to testing whether something is genuine as one might test metals.

01:17:37.829 --> 01:17:41.829
Do we see the point of what this verse tells us?

01:17:41.829 --> 01:17:48.829
As Christians, we need to keep testing continually that we are in the faith.

01:17:48.829 --> 01:17:52.829
But now, what does this word faith mean in this context?

01:17:52.829 --> 01:18:04.829
It's not just referring to the quality of faith, but rather, it involves all the Christian teachings that we find in God's Word, the Bible.

01:18:04.829 --> 01:18:17.829
So having that in mind, keep testing, keep proving, really means that we need to look at ourselves and see if we're really living up to what the Bible tells us to do.

01:18:17.829 --> 01:18:21.829
Now, that's a very serious maintenance program.

01:18:21.829 --> 01:18:34.829
But just as we do a maintenance program for a vehicle and we might have a checklist, is there a checklist that we can use when we're testing and proving that we're in the faith?

01:18:34.829 --> 01:18:38.829
Yes, there is. We can say there are three things.

01:18:38.829 --> 01:18:46.829
First of all, we need to ask heart-searching questions about our relationship with Jehovah.

01:18:46.829 --> 01:18:52.829
That's the first point. Ask the questions that will search through our heart.

01:18:52.829 --> 01:18:57.829
Secondly, we have to answer honestly.

01:18:57.829 --> 01:19:04.829
Yes, whatever we see is an answer to those questions, then we need to have a correct answer.

01:19:04.829 --> 01:19:22.829
And then finally, we need to seek Jehovah's help in making whatever adjustments we need to make so that we can maintain a spirituality strong and in good standing so that our relationship with Jehovah is good.

01:19:22.829 --> 01:19:31.829
So with that in mind, let's go back to the illustration we started with, a vehicle, a car or a motorbike.

01:19:31.829 --> 01:19:45.829
If you were to compare our Christian faith or our belief, our conduct to a vehicle and the need to maintain it, what sort of things would you make as a comparison?

01:19:45.829 --> 01:19:49.829
Well, perhaps the first thing we might think about is the engine.

01:19:49.829 --> 01:19:57.829
You certainly need to make sure the engine works correctly because that's what gives the vehicle the power to keep moving.

01:19:57.829 --> 01:20:08.829
So it's good for us to ask the question, what is it that moves us or motivates us so that we serve Jehovah acceptably?

01:20:08.829 --> 01:20:18.829
Well, the answer is found in the scriptures, and if we turn together to the first book of Timothy, chapter 4 and verse 8.

01:20:18.829 --> 01:20:24.829
That's first Timothy, chapter 4 and verse 8.

01:20:24.829 --> 01:20:31.829
See if you can discern what it is that we could liken to the engine in a car.

01:20:31.829 --> 01:20:49.829
It tells us, for physical training is beneficial for a little, but godly devotion is beneficial for all things as it holds promise of the life now and the life that is to come.

01:20:50.829 --> 01:20:54.829
Did you see what the scripture tells us is so important?

01:20:54.829 --> 01:20:57.829
Godly devotion.

01:20:57.829 --> 01:21:00.829
But we need to understand what godly devotion is.

01:21:00.829 --> 01:21:07.829
In fact, we also need to appreciate this beautiful expression in the New World translation.

01:21:07.829 --> 01:21:13.829
Many other Bibles just simply translate this as godliness.

01:21:13.829 --> 01:21:26.829
Godliness is beneficial or perhaps they say godly training or being religious or even one version says mental training.

01:21:26.829 --> 01:21:38.829
But the New World translation captures the meaning of the original word here because you can train or program a robot to do a certain job.

01:21:38.829 --> 01:21:43.829
But you can't program it to have godly devotion. Why not?

01:21:43.829 --> 01:21:48.829
Because godly devotion involves how we feel about your hover.

01:21:48.829 --> 01:21:55.829
It means our loyalty to him based on a heart full of love and appreciation.

01:21:55.829 --> 01:22:06.829
So when it says godly devotion is important, it really involves why we do things, not just what we do.

01:22:06.829 --> 01:22:14.829
Well, let's think back to our illustration of the vehicle and you want to test the engine.

01:22:14.829 --> 01:22:19.829
What would you do to check the engine to see if it's okay?

01:22:19.829 --> 01:22:27.829
Well, one thing you might do is keep an eye on the temperature gauge because if the engine is overheating, you know there's a problem.

01:22:27.829 --> 01:22:32.829
Or perhaps you might check the oil to see if there's enough oil.

01:22:32.829 --> 01:22:37.829
Or you may check to see if you've changed the oil regularly enough.

01:22:37.829 --> 01:22:46.829
Or when the engine is idling, you might listen carefully to it to see if it's running smoothly or roughly.

01:22:46.829 --> 01:22:51.829
And of course you'd be interested if there's any strange sounds or noises.

01:22:51.829 --> 01:23:00.829
So that's the type of thing you would have on a checklist when you're trying to see if an engine is working properly.

01:23:00.829 --> 01:23:04.829
Now, none of that applies to godly devotion, does it?

01:23:04.829 --> 01:23:14.829
But what could be on our checklist for us to test godly devotion to see if it's healthy and strong or not?

01:23:14.829 --> 01:23:16.829
Well, again, the Bible helps us.

01:23:16.829 --> 01:23:25.829
If you turn with me this time to the book of Psalms, let's look at Psalm 40 and verse 8.

01:23:25.829 --> 01:23:37.829
Here it tells us, to do your will, oh my God, is my delight.

01:23:37.829 --> 01:23:41.829
And your law is deep within me.

01:23:41.829 --> 01:23:45.829
Now, this is a test of our godly devotion.

01:23:45.829 --> 01:23:47.829
How so?

01:23:47.829 --> 01:23:58.829
Well, we need to ask ourselves, is my service to god something that I really delight in or is it simply a chore?

01:23:58.829 --> 01:24:05.829
Is it something that I do as a mere routine, something that I just keep on doing regularly,

01:24:05.829 --> 01:24:11.829
but don't really have a strong desire to accomplish it?

01:24:11.829 --> 01:24:20.829
Well, if we were thinking that our godly devotion was not so good, not so strong, perhaps we were just doing things out of routine,

01:24:20.829 --> 01:24:26.829
rather than for our love for Jehovah, we need to take action.

01:24:26.829 --> 01:24:34.829
Just the same as if we heard that the engine had a knocking sound or if we saw that it was overheating.

01:24:34.829 --> 01:24:42.829
And that's exactly what Jesus told the brothers back in the first century in the congregation in Ephesus.

01:24:42.829 --> 01:24:49.829
Please turn with me to the book of Revelation 2.

01:24:49.829 --> 01:24:58.829
And you'll remember in this section of the book of Revelation as a series of messages that Jesus gives different congregations.

01:24:58.829 --> 01:25:03.829
Now, the first congregation mentioned is in Ephesus.

01:25:03.829 --> 01:25:11.829
If you look at chapter 2 of Revelation, and if we glance through verses 2 and 3, what do you notice?

01:25:11.829 --> 01:25:18.829
Well, Jesus says to the brothers, I know your deeds and your labor and endurance, that sounds good, doesn't it?

01:25:18.829 --> 01:25:23.829
Then he goes on to say that they didn't tolerate bad men.

01:25:23.829 --> 01:25:30.829
And then in verse 3, he mentions that they persevered, that they had not grown weary.

01:25:30.829 --> 01:25:33.829
So what do we assume from these two verses?

01:25:33.829 --> 01:25:41.829
That our brothers back then in the first century, in the congregation in Ephesus, were busy doing the work of Jehovah.

01:25:41.829 --> 01:25:46.829
Yes, they were active, they weren't giving up.

01:25:46.829 --> 01:25:50.829
But then what does Jesus say in verse 4?

01:25:50.829 --> 01:25:58.829
Nevertheless, I hold this against you, that you have left the love you had at first.

01:25:59.829 --> 01:26:01.829
Do we see the point?

01:26:01.829 --> 01:26:13.829
Clearly, it shows us that Jehovah and Jesus are not just interested in what we do, but also why we do it.

01:26:13.829 --> 01:26:22.829
Yes, they want us to serve our God, Jehovah, in a way that shows that we love Him and that we're loyal to Him.

01:26:22.829 --> 01:26:27.829
Just the same as Jesus loves His Father and is loyal to Him.

01:26:27.829 --> 01:26:29.829
And this is so important.

01:26:29.829 --> 01:26:37.829
The Apostle Paul highlighted this, if you turn with me, please do 1 Corinthians chapter 13.

01:26:37.829 --> 01:26:45.829
1 Corinthians chapter 13, and notice what Paul says under inspiration in verse 3.

01:26:45.829 --> 01:26:56.300
And if I give all my belongings to feed others, and if I hand over my body so that I may boast,

01:26:56.300 --> 01:27:03.840
but I do not have love, I do not benefit at all.

01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:07.840
Now, if we look across at this study note on this verse,

01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:13.840
notice that it says, speaking hypothetically, Paul says that,

01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:17.840
even instead of love, such pride were his motive,

01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:21.840
he would give everything he owned to feed others,

01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:25.840
or would even die a martyr's death as a witness to the truth,

01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:29.840
but he would not benefit at all.

01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:33.840
Isn't that food for thought?

01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:37.840
So thinking about this expression, godly devotion,

01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:42.840
it's interesting that one Bible scholar defined the original word this way.

01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:50.840
He said, it is a very practical awareness of God in every aspect of life.

01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:54.840
So if we were to check our godly devotion,

01:27:54.840 --> 01:28:00.840
and we see that perhaps it's not really working as well as it should,

01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:03.840
maybe it needs maintenance.

01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:07.840
What sort of maintenance would we give it?

01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:15.840
Well, surely we would need to think of Jehovah more often every day to see him as part of our life,

01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:23.840
also meditating on what Jehovah has done for us builds up appreciation and love for him,

01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:29.840
and that motivates us to do what Jehovah wants us to do out of love.

01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:33.840
Yes, our heart full of appreciation.

01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:42.180
And of course, offering prayers regularly to Jehovah helps to strengthen that relationship.

01:28:42.180 --> 01:28:45.180
So what have we learned so far in our discussion?

01:28:45.180 --> 01:28:49.180
Well, just like the engine of a vehicle needs to be maintained,

01:28:49.180 --> 01:28:53.180
we need to be aware of whether or not it's operating correctly.

01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:59.180
In a similar way, we need to ask ourselves honest questions,

01:28:59.180 --> 01:29:05.180
questions that search our hearts with regard to our godly devotion.

01:29:05.180 --> 01:29:11.180
Is our service to Jehovah based simply on routine and a sense of duty?

01:29:11.180 --> 01:29:14.180
Do we view it just as a chore?

01:29:14.180 --> 01:29:22.180
Or does our heart show that it's filled with appreciation and love for Jehovah?

01:29:22.180 --> 01:29:25.180
Well, if we build up that appreciation, that love,

01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:29.180
we can be sure that our godly devotion is good.

01:29:29.180 --> 01:29:32.180
Yes, it's well maintained.

01:29:32.180 --> 01:29:39.180
So that's the first point of comparison that we'd like to make in the maintenance schedule for a vehicle

01:29:39.180 --> 01:29:42.180
and for our spirituality.

01:29:42.180 --> 01:29:45.180
So let's think of another comparison.

01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:50.180
Another very important part of any vehicle are the brakes.

01:29:50.180 --> 01:29:54.180
Now, when we think of the brakes, they're absolutely necessary, aren't they?

01:29:54.180 --> 01:29:58.180
Because someone could jump in front of your vehicle.

01:29:58.180 --> 01:30:02.180
There could be someone who perhaps is coming too quickly

01:30:02.180 --> 01:30:08.180
and you have to avoid them and you need to use those brakes.

01:30:08.180 --> 01:30:17.180
So what do you think we could compare the brakes to with regard to our service to Jehovah and our relationship with Him?

01:30:17.180 --> 01:30:19.180
Well, the Bible gives us a clue.

01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:25.180
As we read Psalm 111, we'll see the answer to that question.

01:30:25.180 --> 01:30:32.180
So as we turn there to Psalm 111, let's see what verse 10 tells us.

01:30:32.180 --> 01:30:39.100
The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom.

01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:44.100
All those observing His orders show good insight.

01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:48.380
His praise endures forever.

01:30:48.380 --> 01:30:53.380
So do you see what could be likened to the brakes of a vehicle?

01:30:53.380 --> 01:30:59.380
What is it that stops us from doing something that displeases Jehovah?

01:30:59.380 --> 01:31:02.380
It's our fear of Jehovah.

01:31:02.380 --> 01:31:07.380
So just as you need to maintain the brakes in a vehicle,

01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:15.380
we also need to make sure that our love for Jehovah and our fear of Jehovah is strong and well maintained.

01:31:15.380 --> 01:31:19.380
Now of course we need to think what do we mean by fear of Jehovah?

01:31:19.380 --> 01:31:24.380
Do we mean shaking all the time worried that He's going to do something wrong to us?

01:31:24.380 --> 01:31:26.380
No.

01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:31.380
Perhaps we could liken it to a chef who has a razor sharp knife.

01:31:31.380 --> 01:31:38.380
Now this knife, when used properly, can help him to attain all sorts of wonderful things.

01:31:38.380 --> 01:31:42.380
But if he misuses it, then he has a problem.

01:31:42.380 --> 01:31:46.380
So in a similar way, if our relationship is strong with Jehovah,

01:31:46.380 --> 01:31:50.380
there's no need for us to be shaking in our boots as it were.

01:31:50.380 --> 01:31:54.380
But rather, we need to remember always that Jehovah is with us.

01:31:54.380 --> 01:32:02.380
And so a healthy fear of Jehovah means that we don't want to displease Him in any way.

01:32:02.380 --> 01:32:07.380
So a fear of Jehovah helps us so that as we're moving along,

01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:15.380
if anything comes our way, we're ready to stop if we shouldn't engage in that activity.

01:32:15.380 --> 01:32:21.380
So let's think for a few moments about the maintenance check for the brakes.

01:32:21.380 --> 01:32:26.380
What would you do? How would you check if the brakes are okay or not?

01:32:26.380 --> 01:32:30.380
Well, mechanics tell us that if you're applying pressure to the brakes

01:32:30.380 --> 01:32:33.380
and you find the steering wheel is starting to shake,

01:32:33.380 --> 01:32:36.380
that's a sign that maybe they need attention.

01:32:36.380 --> 01:32:40.380
Or if you apply pressure to the brakes,

01:32:40.380 --> 01:32:47.380
and the vehicle starts to veer off to one side, again, not a good sign.

01:32:47.380 --> 01:32:51.380
Or as you press the brake pedal,

01:32:51.380 --> 01:32:55.380
if you find there's very little resistance and you have to start pumping it,

01:32:55.380 --> 01:32:58.380
again, that's a problem.

01:32:58.380 --> 01:33:04.380
And of course, like with the engine, if you start to hear strange grinding noises,

01:33:04.380 --> 01:33:07.380
that is never a good sign isn't.

01:33:07.380 --> 01:33:11.380
Well, what about our fear of Jehovah?

01:33:11.380 --> 01:33:17.380
How can we test whether or not our fear of Jehovah is at the right level?

01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:23.789
Well, we know that Satan and his world constantly throw things at us,

01:33:23.789 --> 01:33:27.789
temptations, wrong thinking, and so on.

01:33:27.789 --> 01:33:31.789
So it's just like you're driving in a vehicle and someone jumps out in front of you

01:33:31.789 --> 01:33:37.789
on animal runs across the road, that's when we need those brakes.

01:33:37.789 --> 01:33:40.789
But how do we apply them?

01:33:40.789 --> 01:33:43.789
How does our godly fear help us?

01:33:43.789 --> 01:33:47.789
Well, let's turn to the book of 2 Corinthians

01:33:47.789 --> 01:33:53.789
and see a very interesting point that is mentioned to the brothers back there in Corinth.

01:33:53.789 --> 01:33:56.789
So 2 Corinthians chapter 10,

01:33:56.789 --> 01:34:00.789
and we're going to look at verse 5.

01:34:00.789 --> 01:34:06.789
Now, the context of this chapter is where Paul is talking about wrong teachings.

01:34:06.789 --> 01:34:13.789
But the principle, as outlined in this verse, can be applied also to our reaction to wrong thoughts

01:34:13.789 --> 01:34:20.789
and immoral thoughts, or all sorts of things that are not in harmony with Jehovah's will.

01:34:20.789 --> 01:34:23.789
So let's see if we can see what the principle is.

01:34:23.789 --> 01:34:27.789
2 Corinthians chapter 10 and verse 5.

01:34:29.170 --> 01:34:36.170
For we are overturning reasonings and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God.

01:34:36.170 --> 01:34:45.170
And we are bringing every thought into captivity to make it obedient to the Christ.

01:34:45.170 --> 01:34:47.170
So do we see the point?

01:34:47.170 --> 01:34:50.170
No matter what sort of thought it is,

01:34:50.170 --> 01:34:52.170
if it's an immoral thought,

01:34:52.170 --> 01:34:55.170
a temptation to do something wrong,

01:34:55.170 --> 01:34:59.170
something that's not neutral with regard to the political situation,

01:34:59.170 --> 01:35:01.170
what does it say here?

01:35:01.170 --> 01:35:03.170
We have to react quickly.

01:35:03.170 --> 01:35:06.170
It's just as if we put on the brakes.

01:35:06.170 --> 01:35:13.170
Yes, we have to overturn all these sort of things that could be going on in our mind.

01:35:13.170 --> 01:35:19.170
So obviously it's important for us to test our Godly fear in the sense of thinking,

01:35:19.170 --> 01:35:22.170
how do I normally react?

01:35:22.170 --> 01:35:27.170
If I'm faced with a situation that perhaps tempts me, am I quick to react?

01:35:27.170 --> 01:35:33.170
Do the brakes work properly or is my Godly fear compromised?

01:35:33.170 --> 01:35:36.170
An interesting question.

01:35:36.170 --> 01:35:38.170
Also another illustration.

01:35:38.170 --> 01:35:41.170
Just imagine that in your car,

01:35:41.170 --> 01:35:45.170
you find a whole lot of poisonous spiders.

01:35:45.170 --> 01:35:47.170
Well, that's not good, isn't it?

01:35:47.170 --> 01:35:51.170
Of course, you get someone to help you get rid of those spiders.

01:35:51.170 --> 01:35:54.170
Now, after you've paid that person to do the job,

01:35:54.170 --> 01:35:57.170
how would you feel if they said, well, we got most of them.

01:35:57.170 --> 01:35:59.170
It could be one or two left.

01:35:59.170 --> 01:36:02.170
I don't think you'd be very happy, would you?

01:36:02.170 --> 01:36:06.170
Because you won all of those poisonous spiders out of the car.

01:36:06.170 --> 01:36:10.170
But what does it tell us here in verse 5?

01:36:10.170 --> 01:36:18.170
It says, we have to get all the things that are out of harmony with Jehovah under control.

01:36:18.170 --> 01:36:23.170
Yes, we could find that even though most of the things

01:36:23.170 --> 01:36:30.170
are under control, there could be just a few areas where we haven't got them under control.

01:36:30.170 --> 01:36:35.170
It could even be that as if we're going in the wrong direction.

01:36:35.170 --> 01:36:41.170
Well, what do you need to do if you find out you're driving on the highway in the wrong direction?

01:36:41.170 --> 01:36:45.170
Stop, turn around and go the opposite direction.

01:36:45.170 --> 01:36:52.170
So isn't that exactly what we should do when it comes to this matter of checking our Godly fear?

01:36:53.170 --> 01:36:58.170
Yes, if we see that in any way we're a little slow in reacting

01:36:58.170 --> 01:37:02.170
when immoral temptations come our way or other wrong thinking,

01:37:02.170 --> 01:37:06.170
then we need to strengthen our fear for Jehovah.

01:37:06.170 --> 01:37:11.170
Yes, our fear of Jehovah helps us to resist these things.

01:37:11.170 --> 01:37:16.170
Now, what's something that can help to strengthen our fear of Jehovah?

01:37:16.170 --> 01:37:19.170
Well, again, the Bible gives us an indication.

01:37:19.170 --> 01:37:23.170
This time we find it in the book of Proverbs.

01:37:23.170 --> 01:37:28.170
Proverbs chapter 8 and verse 13.

01:37:28.170 --> 01:37:33.170
And you'll notice this is a little definition or formula for us.

01:37:33.170 --> 01:37:38.579
Proverbs chapter 8 and verse 13.

01:37:38.579 --> 01:37:45.579
The fear of Jehovah means the hating of bad.

01:37:45.579 --> 01:37:49.579
So what is it that can help us strengthen our fear of Jehovah?

01:37:49.579 --> 01:37:52.579
We need to hate what is bad.

01:37:52.579 --> 01:37:56.579
Now for a moment, let me ask you this question.

01:37:56.579 --> 01:38:00.579
Is there some type of food that you really hate?

01:38:00.579 --> 01:38:06.579
I know I can think of a couple of things that I just, I really can't eat, and I hate them.

01:38:06.579 --> 01:38:11.979
If someone tries to tempt you to eat that food,

01:38:11.979 --> 01:38:16.979
are you going to give in easily? Of course not, because you hate that type of food.

01:38:16.979 --> 01:38:24.979
Well, how much more important it is for us to develop within ourselves a hatred for what is bad?

01:38:24.979 --> 01:38:29.979
Yes, we have to make sure that when we see things that Jehovah hates,

01:38:29.979 --> 01:38:33.979
that we feel the same way, that we don't accept them.

01:38:33.979 --> 01:38:42.979
Never would we allow gradualism to change our feelings with regard to what Jehovah says is wrong.

01:38:43.979 --> 01:38:48.979
Now as we read on, looking back at Proverbs chapter 8 verse 13,

01:38:48.979 --> 01:38:52.979
notice it says, the fear of Jehovah means the hating of bad.

01:38:52.979 --> 01:38:58.979
Then it says, I hate self-exaltation and pride,

01:38:58.979 --> 01:39:02.979
and the evil way and perverse speech.

01:39:02.979 --> 01:39:09.979
So we need to make sure that we take out of our hearts any sort of pride

01:39:09.979 --> 01:39:13.979
that could interfere with our relationship with Jehovah.

01:39:13.979 --> 01:39:18.979
That's very important, and that's part of hating what Jehovah hates.

01:39:18.979 --> 01:39:22.979
Just think for a moment, as we're doing this checklist

01:39:22.979 --> 01:39:27.979
to see how our fear of Jehovah is, is it strong or weak?

01:39:27.979 --> 01:39:33.979
We need to think about what things do I really feel proud about?

01:39:33.979 --> 01:39:37.979
Is there something that deep inside you you feel?

01:39:37.979 --> 01:39:41.979
Yes, I feel really proud about this.

01:39:41.979 --> 01:39:46.979
We'll never forget David's son, Absalom.

01:39:46.979 --> 01:39:52.979
He was proud about his hair, but in the end it was his hair that goes into the problem

01:39:52.979 --> 01:39:57.979
and he ended up dying because of his hair being caught in the branches.

01:39:57.979 --> 01:40:00.979
So never would we want to be like Absalom

01:40:00.979 --> 01:40:08.979
and allow the thing that we are proud of to actually cause us a serious problem.

01:40:08.979 --> 01:40:10.979
So that's been interesting, hasn't it?

01:40:10.979 --> 01:40:15.979
Looking at a second comparison between the maintenance of a car

01:40:15.979 --> 01:40:19.979
and the maintenance of our Godly fear.

01:40:19.979 --> 01:40:26.979
Just like the brakes, Godly fear can help us to stop before we do something

01:40:26.979 --> 01:40:29.979
that would displace Jehovah.

01:40:29.979 --> 01:40:35.979
Now of course, when we're thinking of this matter of comparing the maintenance of a vehicle

01:40:35.979 --> 01:40:37.979
with the maintenance of our spirituality,

01:40:37.979 --> 01:40:42.979
there are so many different comparisons that we could make.

01:40:42.979 --> 01:40:45.979
And your mind's probably already going there thinking of,

01:40:45.979 --> 01:40:48.979
well, will we make this comparison or that one?

01:40:48.979 --> 01:40:51.979
But we only have time for one more comparison.

01:40:51.979 --> 01:40:55.979
And you probably won't think of the one that we're going to talk about.

01:40:55.979 --> 01:40:58.979
That is the horn.

01:40:58.979 --> 01:41:04.979
You see, in some parts of the world, drivers say the horn is just as important as the brakes.

01:41:04.979 --> 01:41:06.979
Why?

01:41:06.979 --> 01:41:10.979
Because they need to let people know they're driving along the road.

01:41:10.979 --> 01:41:15.979
It could be someone is beside them and they're about to change lanes and crash into them.

01:41:15.979 --> 01:41:17.979
Well, the horn can help.

01:41:17.979 --> 01:41:21.979
Or it could be someone is distracted and they're crossing the road.

01:41:21.979 --> 01:41:24.979
Again, the horn will help.

01:41:24.979 --> 01:41:29.979
So a horn used correctly can save lives.

01:41:29.979 --> 01:41:36.979
So what do you think we're going to compare the horn to with regard to our spiritual activities?

01:41:36.979 --> 01:41:39.979
Well, if we read 1 Timothy together,

01:41:39.979 --> 01:41:44.979
1 Timothy chapter 4 and verse 16,

01:41:44.979 --> 01:41:47.979
we'll see what the comparison is.

01:41:47.979 --> 01:41:51.979
1 Timothy chapter 4 and verse 16.

01:41:51.979 --> 01:41:58.329
Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching.

01:41:58.329 --> 01:42:00.329
Persevere in these things.

01:42:00.329 --> 01:42:07.329
For by doing this, you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.

01:42:07.329 --> 01:42:13.329
So we could say that just as a horn is important with regard to a vehicle,

01:42:13.329 --> 01:42:18.329
likewise, our sounding out the message of the good news,

01:42:18.329 --> 01:42:23.329
out teaching others, and telling them about the nearness of your harvest day

01:42:23.329 --> 01:42:28.329
can result in lives being saved.

01:42:28.329 --> 01:42:31.329
But now, if you were to check a horn,

01:42:31.329 --> 01:42:35.329
what would you be looking for or pass more importantly listening to?

01:42:35.329 --> 01:42:39.329
Well, for a start, you'd try to test the horn and honk it.

01:42:39.329 --> 01:42:43.329
Now, if the no sound comes out, you know you have a problem.

01:42:43.329 --> 01:42:48.329
Or on the other hand, if the sound is too soft that nobody can hear it,

01:42:48.329 --> 01:42:52.329
that likewise is a problem.

01:42:52.329 --> 01:42:54.329
So what about us?

01:42:54.329 --> 01:42:59.329
Do we need to think about how our proclamation of the good news is?

01:42:59.329 --> 01:43:01.329
Yes.

01:43:01.329 --> 01:43:06.329
Let's take not just the normal activities we're involved with without preaching work,

01:43:06.329 --> 01:43:08.329
but what about informal witnessing?

01:43:08.329 --> 01:43:10.329
Do you see the opportunity?

01:43:10.329 --> 01:43:17.329
Do you think, yes, I need to talk to this person and nothing happens.

01:43:17.329 --> 01:43:21.329
The horns are working in a symbolic sense.

01:43:21.329 --> 01:43:25.329
Or perhaps we do have the opportunity and we take it,

01:43:25.329 --> 01:43:28.329
but the message is not clear.

01:43:28.329 --> 01:43:33.329
So persons don't really understand what we're saying.

01:43:33.329 --> 01:43:36.329
So if either of those were the case,

01:43:36.329 --> 01:43:42.329
we'd need to see that maintenance is required with regard to this symbolic horn.

01:43:42.329 --> 01:43:44.329
What would we do?

01:43:44.329 --> 01:43:48.329
Well, it could involve praying to Jehovah for courage,

01:43:48.329 --> 01:43:51.329
here's boldness to be able to witness to others,

01:43:51.329 --> 01:43:57.329
whether it's informally telephone witnessing or other forms of witnessing.

01:43:57.329 --> 01:44:04.329
And then if we're not so clear or coherent with regard to how we present the message,

01:44:04.329 --> 01:44:07.329
how important it is for us to practice ahead of time,

01:44:07.329 --> 01:44:11.329
to have special sessions where we practice what we'll say,

01:44:11.329 --> 01:44:18.329
and then this way we can be ready to give a clear message to those who listen.

01:44:18.329 --> 01:44:22.329
Well, that's been a very interesting exercise, hasn't it?

01:44:22.329 --> 01:44:24.329
What did we see?

01:44:24.329 --> 01:44:27.329
If we're using this comparison, this illustration of a vehicle,

01:44:27.329 --> 01:44:33.329
we could say that the engine of a vehicle is like our godly devotion.

01:44:33.329 --> 01:44:37.329
Our devotion of Jehovah needs to come from our hearts.

01:44:37.329 --> 01:44:42.329
And the brakes of a vehicle we could liken to our fear of Jehovah.

01:44:42.329 --> 01:44:45.329
Yes, if we hate what is bad the same as Jehovah does,

01:44:45.329 --> 01:44:49.329
it will stop us just like brakes do.

01:44:49.329 --> 01:44:55.329
And then finally we discuss this matter of having a horn that sounds the message properly.

01:44:55.329 --> 01:45:01.329
Yes, we need to make sure that we ask Jehovah's help to maintain our witnessing

01:45:01.329 --> 01:45:07.329
in such a way that we can clearly help others to hear the message.

01:45:07.329 --> 01:45:10.329
So as we've gone through this, I'm sure, as we've already mentioned,

01:45:10.329 --> 01:45:13.329
you can think of many other comparisons.

01:45:13.329 --> 01:45:22.329
But the point is, a wise driver does not just drive his car or motorbike

01:45:22.329 --> 01:45:25.329
or whatever vehicle it is.

01:45:25.329 --> 01:45:32.329
A wise driver also checks to make sure that the vehicle is safe to use.

01:45:32.329 --> 01:45:38.329
So likewise, for us as 2 Corinthians 13 verse 5 says,

01:45:38.329 --> 01:45:40.329
we need to keep testing.

01:45:40.329 --> 01:45:44.329
Yes, we need to keep proving that we are in the faith.

01:45:44.329 --> 01:45:49.329
In other words, keep checking that we really are Christians,

01:45:49.329 --> 01:45:54.329
that we are really living up to what we believe and what we teach others to do.

01:45:55.329 --> 01:45:59.329
But remember, what is it that can be a problem for us?

01:45:59.329 --> 01:46:03.329
Well, again, if we turn to the book of Corinthians this time,

01:46:03.329 --> 01:46:08.329
1 Corinthians chapter 10 and verse 12,

01:46:08.329 --> 01:46:11.329
we'll see what the problem can be.

01:46:11.329 --> 01:46:17.329
That's 1 Corinthians chapter 10 and verse 12.

01:46:17.329 --> 01:46:23.329
Let the one who thinks he is standing, but we're that he does not follow.

01:46:23.329 --> 01:46:27.329
Yes, just thinking everything is okay.

01:46:27.329 --> 01:46:34.329
There's no problems thinking that we're just going on fine without testing ourselves

01:46:34.329 --> 01:46:38.329
and proving that we're in the truth, that can be a problem.

01:46:38.329 --> 01:46:43.329
Just like lack of maintenance to a vehicle can result in not only damage

01:46:43.329 --> 01:46:48.329
with regard to the vehicle, but also loss of life.

01:46:48.329 --> 01:46:52.329
How important than it is that we continue to keep testing

01:46:52.329 --> 01:46:57.329
whether or not we are in the faith or in the truth.

01:46:57.329 --> 01:47:01.329
So if we do these tests regularly, and we check to see,

01:47:01.329 --> 01:47:05.329
how is our godly devotion going, how is our fear of Jehovah,

01:47:05.329 --> 01:47:10.329
our hatred for what is bad, how is our sounding out of the message going?

01:47:11.329 --> 01:47:16.329
If we see some weaknesses, what do we need to do?

01:47:16.329 --> 01:47:21.329
Well, our final scripture takes us back to our theme scripture.

01:47:21.329 --> 01:47:25.329
Remember that was 2 Corinthians chapter 13.

01:47:25.329 --> 01:47:31.329
And verse 5 is where it says keep testing, keep proving that you yourselves,

01:47:31.329 --> 01:47:34.329
what you yourselves are.

01:47:34.329 --> 01:47:39.329
But then if we look down a little further to verse 11,

01:47:39.329 --> 01:47:45.329
we'll notice what it tells us that we need to do if we see some problems.

01:47:45.329 --> 01:47:56.329
In verse 11, it tells us finally brothers continue to rejoice to be re-adjusted.

01:47:56.329 --> 01:48:00.329
Now what does this mean to be re-adjusted?

01:48:00.329 --> 01:48:06.329
Well, if you look up at verse 9, you see the same expression is used there at the end of verse 9.

01:48:06.329 --> 01:48:10.329
And the study note to that verse tells us this.

01:48:10.329 --> 01:48:17.329
It says the word is used to describe the restoring of something to a proper condition.

01:48:17.329 --> 01:48:23.329
For instance, at Matthew 421, the word is used to describe mending nets.

01:48:23.329 --> 01:48:29.329
So nets that are damaged or have holes in them, mending them is just like re-adjusting them.

01:48:29.329 --> 01:48:35.329
Agulation 6.1, the same verb is used of the need to re-adjust spiritually,

01:48:35.329 --> 01:48:39.329
a fellow believer who has taken a false step.

01:48:39.329 --> 01:48:47.329
The term is sometimes used in medical text to describe the setting of a barn, a limb or a joint.

01:48:47.329 --> 01:48:50.329
So what's the point?

01:48:50.329 --> 01:48:58.329
If we do this checklist, go through it, and we see that somehow our godly devotion is not as strong as it should be.

01:48:58.329 --> 01:49:04.329
We're just doing things out of routine, but our love for Jehovah is no longer strong.

01:49:04.329 --> 01:49:10.329
Or if we find that our fear of Jehovah is not stopping us from doing what is wrong.

01:49:10.329 --> 01:49:15.329
Or if we're finding that we just are not thoroughly bearing witness to the good news.

01:49:15.329 --> 01:49:18.329
Then we need to take action.

01:49:18.329 --> 01:49:24.329
What does it involve? Well, as it says here, first of all, identifying what the problem is,

01:49:24.329 --> 01:49:32.329
then re-adjusting, repairing, and in some places, replacing activities.

01:49:32.329 --> 01:49:38.329
So brothers and sisters, let's always remember, no matter how long we've been in the truth,

01:49:38.329 --> 01:49:44.329
no matter what privileges we have, we need to keep looking at that checklist.

01:49:44.329 --> 01:49:50.329
Yes, we need to keep testing and proving that we are in the faith.

01:49:50.329 --> 01:49:59.960
Thank you, brother Jackson, for helping us to examine our motives and strengthen our relationship with Jehovah.

01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:06.960
Today, we have discussed what genuine faith is, and we have considered evidence that provides a basis for faith.

01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:11.960
What can we look forward to on the next segment of the program?

01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:17.960
The scripture theme will be, put up a hard fight for the faith.

01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:24.960
We'll learn how to put our faith into action, and how to resist things that could weaken our faith.

01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:31.960
We'll see examples of brothers and sisters around the earth who are putting up a hard fight for the faith.

01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:37.960
Our closing song is number 119. Entitled, we must have faith.

01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:44.960
Let's sing song number 119, and after the song, you may have your own closing prayer.
