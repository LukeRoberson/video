00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:11.070
In Japan, religious rituals are associated with each stage of life and with each season

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.029
of the year.

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:21.109
As Jehovah's Witnesses, we want to keep the cleanliness and unity of the congregation.

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:26.870
In this regard, one of the most delicate areas is the decision on whether to attend a non-witness

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.449
funeral or not.

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:36.969
The first thing we must consider regarding funerals is not to be involved in religious rituals

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:41.770
or the acts of worship that are condemned by the Bible.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.009
In harmony with the Principle at the 2nd Corinthians chapter 6 and verse 14, we need

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:52.219
to keep completely separate from pagan acts of worship.

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:58.420
Next, even if we don't participate in the worship of other religions, we need to consider

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.590
if our decisions could stumble someone in the congregation.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:10.510
When we consider the Bible Principle in Luke chapter 17, verse 2, we do not want our decisions

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:18.760
to hinder the faith of someone in the congregation.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.459
The third point to think about is our conscience.

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:29.519
We need to seriously think about the Bible Principle in Galatians chapter 6, verse 5, where

00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:34.719
it says that each must carry his own load.

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:40.000
This Bible Principle also applies when elders want to support others.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.640
Of course, those in the congregation can ask the elders for support in issues related

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.319
to funerals.

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:55.459
However, in matters of conscience, elders cannot force decisions on others.

00:01:55.459 --> 00:02:02.349
So it would be wrong to make some kind of rule regarding attending non-witness funerals.

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:08.310
If each person can make decisions based on Bible Principles, we can have a truly peaceful

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:16.400
and free atmosphere, where each individual's differing situation is respected.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.439
This would really contribute to the unity of the congregation, and all can maintain

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:28.939
a clean conscience and serve happily before Jehovah.

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:34.460
In my culture, specifically the Namibian or Shihuahambok culture, like in many African

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:40.819
cultures, there are many artistic customs related to weddings that are included in

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.300
wedding celebrations.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.900
Unfortunately, my family is not in the truth.

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:49.300
So obviously for Ben and I, that was one of the main concerns.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.099
They don't understand our worship of Jehovah, and they don't understand that we apply

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:56.620
Bible Principles and not a tradition of men.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.419
We got engaged before the pandemic, but obviously now that our wedding was to be over video

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:06.340
conferencing, it meant that we didn't have control over many things.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.580
We tried to imagine situations that could stumble our brothers or disrupt the unity in

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.860
the congregation.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.340
We had to, in advance, think of Bible Principles that would apply in our case, but particularly

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.219
what we also found helpful was speaking to a mature elder.

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:28.780
He gave us a principle in Proverbs 14 verse 15.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:35.219
He told us to be very careful when people say, I will do this or I won't do this at

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:36.539
your wedding.

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:41.340
Basically, it was up to us to make sure that the proceedings or things that happen at

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.539
our wedding would be in order and in harmony with Bible Principles.

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:51.379
Another principle that came to mind was 1 Corinthians 10 verse 23.

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:57.900
So obviously we knew that we had the right to do many things, but we were also very conscious

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.419
of how our brothers would view our wedding.

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:07.460
We didn't want anybody to be at our wedding and feel embarrassed or even stumble to be

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.060
there.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.099
Now looking back at our wedding, we look back with fond memories.

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:21.300
So a buying Bible principle doesn't restrict our fun.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.819
Also it contributed to the unity among our brothers because all of us, those present,

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:28.899
those who were invited, we were able to enjoy the wedding.

00:04:28.899 --> 00:04:32.220
You're not worried about, oh, did that thing offend anybody?

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.420
So you're able to enjoy the day without any bad memories.
