00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:03.810
Let's meet a sister who's

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.809
Applied the council to serve God from her youth on

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:11.250
Sister Lydia Barnes is from Jamaica

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.150
Her gifts to Jehovah May have changed with age

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:20.850
But what she gives to him today is in no way less valuable

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:31.890
I was born in the year 1911

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.210
I think I began to learn about the truth in the

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.850
1930s

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:46.609
We never have babies studies like we're having it. No, I always read this watch to our magazine

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:54.049
Because when I read that magazine that what got me interested so I keep reading I

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.850
Could remember it was a

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:03.490
Convention we had and that back there was by the drug root afford

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.450
Was the one who lived the talk

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.930
So we should go know advertise advertise advertise the king and the kingdom

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.329
I realized then that this was something different

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.890
So that is where I make my personal decision. I was it's tough advertising

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:30.049
I take any and every opportunity to witness to people

00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:34.689
Lots of people come and visit me nobody have ever come

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.329
in my house

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:39.329
And they don't get a thorough witness

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.329
I sometimes in and out of the hospital

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.930
And so even the hospital

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.890
I have my territory right there. I do it in nurses. I do it with my doctor

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:56.450
I wouldn't say it's somebody helped me

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.489
Because I would say I'm helping somebody

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.489
There is so and it I always find myself

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:08.210
Talking to Jehovah

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.210
Sometimes we have anxieties

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.810
And I would solicit Jehovah's help

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.849
scripture shall we should remember

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.490
Our grand creator in the days of our youth before these evil days come

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.210
I am now

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:29.009
And

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:31.969
I am not able to do as before

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.090
So I guess it's a good thing. I always use the days of my youth

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.689
To do a lot was possible in Jehovah's service

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:49.490
Nothing could make me relax now. I always have to be talking about Jehovah

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:53.169
And the many blessings that I receive at his hand

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:58.449
Imagine that we can make Jehovah's heart which is a pleasure

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:01.330
So I enjoy that very much

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.210
The muscles know

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:05.490
You know

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.610
Not

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.610
For a month strong as before

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:15.090
I don't walk on the street by myself somebody escorted me to the kingdom hall here

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.370
If my brothers they don't see me at the meeting

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:21.090
I want to know what happened to Sister Barnes

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:26.370
Because everybody is looking forward to see me there

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.849
And I will say good morning brothers

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:38.050
And they were morning Sister Barnes and some of them had a wonderful name for calling me

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.449
Some is listening forward for my comment

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:45.409
So I find and the brothers they are happy

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:48.289
To have met the meeting

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:53.330
And I told them when they feel that way about me it makes me feel good too

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:57.969
Because I can see that I am of some use

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:02.129
When we miss the meeting we lose a lot

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:12.530
I want all of us as a family then to enjoy Jehovah's new world to come

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:17.329
My determination is to work with Jehovah

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:23.009
Be it to the end of my life or to the end of the soul existing

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:29.649
I shall return to the days of my youth and my flesh will be fresher than that of a bead

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.029
Remember then your grand creator and the days of your youth

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.230
That was Sister Barnes's determination

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.790
Lillian is now 108 years old and has been baptized for nearly 82 years

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:04.509
Her beautiful example shows the contentment that comes from serving God whole soul at any age
