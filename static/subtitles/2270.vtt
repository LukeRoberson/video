00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:21.620
Time and circumstance Don't always work in our favor

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.620
What might have been if we just have the chance?

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:35.789
Is something we may never know But God lets down and see

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:49.200
He knows us better than me He sees what we are and what more we could be

00:00:50.200 --> 00:01:04.799
It's all in the way that we could no matter what talent you give

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.739
We possess on each one

00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:20.870
To be is caring as food, so you're my friend

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:28.280
Cause you're always there, some downs and convales we've shared

00:01:28.280 --> 00:02:01.819
And I'm made so much of heartlessly

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:05.819
But sometimes our tears maybe all that can't speak

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:41.439
Expressing what words cannot say

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:45.439
Through our ups and downs and through all we've shared

00:02:45.439 --> 00:03:36.310
And I'm made so much of heartlessly
