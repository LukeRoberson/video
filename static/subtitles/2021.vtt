00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:09.519
And in production to the Book of Songs,

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:12.519
Songs is a compilation of sacred songs,

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:15.519
which have been an important feature of true worship

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.519
that highlight giving praise to Jehovah.

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:22.519
In fact, God's name, Jehovah,

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.519
and a shortened form of it, Ja,

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.519
appear almost 800 times throughout the book.

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:33.429
The writing of the Book of Songs

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:36.429
spanned about 1,000 years.

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:40.429
Moses is considered to be the earliest composer.

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:43.429
The Psalms were compiled after the return

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:46.429
of the Jews to Jerusalem from Babylonian exile,

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:48.429
apparently by the scribe Ezra.

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:53.840
Although Jehovah inspired such men as Solomon,

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.840
the sons of Korah, the house of Asaph,

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.840
and others to pen these moving expressions of faith,

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.840
more than half of the Psalms are attributed to David.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.840
The different experiences in David's life

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.840
provided the background for many of the Psalms.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.840
The headings or super-scriptions

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.840
found at the beginning of many Psalms,

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.840
identify the writer and give other information about the Psalm.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.840
The book is made up of 150 chapters.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.840
It is the largest book of the Bible.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.840
The Psalms were compiled into five separate books or volumes.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.840
Several themes are developed in these lyrical works.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.840
Consider just three of them.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.840
Praise to Jehovah is a recurring theme.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.840
Many Psalms praise Jehovah for his saving acts.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.840
Other Psalms praise Jehovah for his creative works,

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.840
from the marvels of the human body to the earth and seas.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.150
Psalm 83 praises Jehovah as the most high over all the earth.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.150
Another theme developed in Psalms is that Jehovah helps

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.150
and comforts those who love him.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.150
Jehovah is referred to as the hero of prayer

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.150
and as a merciful father who pardons repentance sinners.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.150
Psalm 23 describes Jehovah as a loving shepherd,

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.150
who guides, protects, and cares for his people.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.150
An additional theme is that Jehovah will transform the earth into a paradise

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.150
by means of the Messianic Kingdom.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.150
This Kingdom will remove all wickedness and bring peace to the earth.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.500
Certain Psalms are grouped together.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:56.500
For example, Psalms 113 to 118 form the group called the Hellel Psalms.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.500
Did you know it is likely that Jesus and His disciples

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.500
sang these very Psalms after the Lord's evening meal.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:13.840
Psalms 120 to 134 are called the Songs of the Ascents.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.840
Many believe these Psalms were sung

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.840
as the Israelites ascended to Jerusalem

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.840
to attend the three great annual festivals.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.840
The last five Psalms form a group in which each begins and ends

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.840
with the words Praise Ja.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.840
An important feature of Psalms is that it contains numerous prophecies

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.840
about the Messiah.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.840
Jesus himself said,

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.840
All the things written about me and the Psalms must be fulfilled.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.840
As you read the book of Psalms,

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.840
take note of how it supports Jehovah's sovereignty,

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.840
how Jehovah helps and comforts those who love Him.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.840
And how Jehovah will transform the earth into a paradise

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.840
by means of His Messianic Kingdom.
