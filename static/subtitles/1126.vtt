00:00:04.179 --> 00:00:08.179
Our theme does not end in the form of a question.

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:12.179
Rather, it is a statement of fact.

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.179
We can rejoice despite danger.

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:21.179
Please follow along as we look to the example that the Apostle Paul said.

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:24.179
He was able to rejoice despite danger,

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:28.179
and he faced many dangers in his ministry.

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:33.179
In one verse, he mentions eight different types of dangers he faced,

00:00:33.179 --> 00:00:37.179
including dangers from robbers.

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:44.179
While in Ephesus, Paul may even have been exposed to wild beasts in an arena.

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:48.179
Please turn with me to 2 Corinthians chapter 1.

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:51.179
We'll read verses 8 through 11.

00:00:51.179 --> 00:01:00.859
And notice what it says.

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:08.859
For we do not want you to be unaware, brothers, of the tribulation we experienced in the province of Asia.

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:12.859
He wrote this while he was in Europe, Macedonia.

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:15.859
He continues,

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:20.859
we were under extreme pressure beyond our own strength,

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:25.859
so that we were very uncertain even of our lives.

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:30.859
In fact, we felt that we had received the sentence of death.

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:35.859
This was so that we would trust not in ourselves,

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:39.859
but in the God who raises up the dead.

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:45.859
From such a great risk of death, he did rescue us and will rescue us,

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:51.859
and our hope is in him that he will also continue to rescue us.

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:55.859
You also can help us by your supplication for us,

00:01:55.859 --> 00:02:03.859
in order that many may give thanks in our behalf for the favor we receive in answer to the prayers of many.

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:11.460
Less than a year earlier, he had written his first letter to the Corinthians.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.460
This time he was in Asia, the city of Ephesus.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.460
In the 15th chapter of that letter, verse 32,

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.460
he says,

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:30.460
If, like other men, I have fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, of what good is it to me?

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:36.460
His comments would fit an experience with literal wild beasts in the arena.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.460
But Paul's hope in the resurrection strengthened him.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.460
As he said,

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.460
This was so that we would trust not in ourselves,

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.460
but in the God who raises up the dead.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.460
He was also encouraged in strengthened by fellow Christians.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.460
He said,

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.460
You also can help us by your supplication for us,

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:14.460
in order that many may give thanks in our behalf for the favor we receive in answer to the prayers of many.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.460
In the congregation,

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:23.460
we also enjoy a warm brotherhood which provides assistance and support in numerous ways.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.460
At one point in his ministry,

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.460
Paul and his traveling companions felt extreme pressure,

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.460
and were uncertain even of their lives.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.460
Where did Paul find support and relief?

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:45.460
He was encouraged and consoled by fellow Christians who came to his aid.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:51.460
When natural disasters or other calamities strike time and again,

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.460
our Christian brothers are the first on the scene to render needed assistance materially

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:02.460
and spiritually to fellow Christians as well as to others in need.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.460
Today, Christians are not exposed to wild beasts and arenas.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.460
However, like Paul,

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:18.129
we can rejoice despite danger that we may face.

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:23.129
Any of us can face dangers from robbers or the threat of physical assault,

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:26.129
especially in times of civil unrest.

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:34.129
The Bible foretold that in these last days, people would be fierce without love of goodness.

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:37.129
As you watch the following video,

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:43.129
note which provisions helped one family to rejoice despite such dangers.

00:04:43.129 --> 00:05:01.699
I was born in Caracas and live in an area of the city called Patari.

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:06.699
In Patari, I have to live with violence and delinquency.

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:12.699
A few years ago, we lost a pioneer sister who sadly was hit by a bullet.

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:17.699
Well, something like that also happened to my son.

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:24.699
There was a confrontation in the neighborhood and a stray bullet hit my son and killed him instantly.

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:32.939
That left such a void.

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:36.939
It hurt me to go into his room and see his empty bed,

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:40.939
and then to see his things, his shoes, his favorite clothes,

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:47.769
see them in the wardrobe, crying was inevitable.

00:05:47.769 --> 00:05:55.699
But these situations were very difficult to deal with at the time.

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:59.699
But as soon as the congregation found out about the situation,

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:02.699
right away they gave me support.

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:10.230
They were there to help care for all the things you need to do when you lose a loved one.

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:15.230
After going through all that, I was very afraid to continue going out in field service.

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:21.980
I feared for my life and for the life of my family.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:29.899
I prayed to Jehovah and Jehovah gave me practical wisdom to continue.

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:34.899
Sometimes when I'm alone meditating and thinking about my son,

00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:40.899
those memories return and of course I have a setback for so to speak.

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:43.899
And I begin to cry again.

00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:47.899
But keeping clearly in mind the promise of the resurrection

00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:50.899
is what motivates me to keep going.

00:06:50.899 --> 00:07:00.379
An account that I really like and that I always keep in mind is the account about Lazarus.

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:04.379
Their Martha uses an expression, she says,

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:07.379
I know he will rise on the last day.

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:10.379
And there's the same confidence that I have in Jehovah.

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:12.379
I know that my son will rise.

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:19.180
Jehovah will give him to me.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.180
At the time that this terrible thing happened.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:29.779
It's true I lost my joy for a time.

00:07:29.779 --> 00:07:34.779
But later, after the morning passes, the resurrection hope gives us joy.

00:07:34.779 --> 00:07:37.779
It is if Jehovah speaks to me saying, keep calm.

00:07:37.779 --> 00:07:40.779
It is if he gives me a gentle pat, telling me to keep going.

00:07:40.779 --> 00:07:42.779
And that's what will happen to you.

00:07:42.779 --> 00:07:44.779
Keep faithful and continue loyal.

00:07:44.779 --> 00:07:53.540
And I will give him back to you.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:57.540
Did you notice what helped this family to rejoice despite danger?

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:59.540
Prayer?

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.540
Their hope in the resurrection?

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.540
The support of brotherhood.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.540
And of course, Jehovah's spirit.

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:10.540
Which provisions from Jehovah are helping you to rejoice?

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.540
Despite the dangers you may have to face.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.540
Is it your relationship with Jehovah?

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.540
The brotherhood?

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.540
Our hope?

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.540
Or something else?

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:28.540
In these last days with critical times, hard to deal with.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:34.539
We're being admonished to rejoice in the hope of deliverance from danger.

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:37.539
We long for the end of this wicked system.

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:41.539
Justice Habakkuk long for relief from wickedness in his day.

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:45.539
Let's look at Habakkuk chapter 1.

00:08:45.539 --> 00:08:50.539
Feel the stress that he felt as a result of the violence, quarreling,

00:08:50.539 --> 00:08:53.539
and oppression that surrounded him.

00:08:53.539 --> 00:08:58.539
He asks, how long old Jehovah?

00:08:58.539 --> 00:09:02.539
How long must I ask for help from violence?

00:09:02.539 --> 00:09:05.539
Why do you make me witness wrongdoing?

00:09:05.539 --> 00:09:07.539
Why do you tolerate oppression?

00:09:07.539 --> 00:09:10.539
Why are destruction and violence before me?

00:09:11.539 --> 00:09:14.539
Why do quarreling and conflict about?

00:09:14.539 --> 00:09:17.909
Why?

00:09:17.909 --> 00:09:19.909
Why?

00:09:19.909 --> 00:09:21.909
Why?

00:09:21.909 --> 00:09:23.909
How long?

00:09:23.909 --> 00:09:27.909
But note what he recorded in chapter 2, verse 3.

00:09:27.909 --> 00:09:34.480
For the vision is yet for its appointed time.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.480
And it is rushing toward its end.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.480
And it will not lie.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:44.480
Even if it should delay, keep in expectation of it.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:51.480
For it will, without fail come true, it will not be late.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.480
Like Habakkuk, we trust in Jehovah,

00:09:54.480 --> 00:10:00.480
and have the assurance that he will soon end violence.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:04.480
Habakkuk took the initiative to draw close to Jehovah,

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.480
his trusted friend and father.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.480
He did not just fret over his situation,

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.480
relying on his own understanding.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:17.480
Instead, he prayed about his feelings and worries.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.480
That's a good example for us.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:26.480
Notice his resolve in chapter 3 and verse 18.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.480
There he says,

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:34.480
As for me, I will exalt in Jehovah.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:40.889
I will be joyful in the God of my salvation.

00:10:40.889 --> 00:10:46.889
Today, Jehovah, the hear of prayer, invites us to show our trust

00:10:46.889 --> 00:10:50.889
by prayerfully sharing our concerns with him.

00:10:50.889 --> 00:10:54.889
Jehovah didn't approve Habakkuk for expressing his anxieties.

00:10:54.889 --> 00:10:58.889
He had them recorded, likely to show that it's only natural for us

00:10:58.889 --> 00:11:01.889
to have such feelings at times.

00:11:01.889 --> 00:11:05.889
But Jehovah wants us to call out to him.

00:11:05.889 --> 00:11:09.889
Doing so will help us to experience Jehovah's response,

00:11:09.889 --> 00:11:14.889
his warm embrace by means of his kind guidance.

00:11:14.889 --> 00:11:21.889
He will help us to know his thoughts, no matter what afflicts us.

00:11:21.889 --> 00:11:25.889
Our heart for a prayer is one of the deepest expressions

00:11:25.889 --> 00:11:27.889
of our trust in God.

00:11:27.889 --> 00:11:32.889
We rejoice in knowing that Jehovah is eager to deliver us

00:11:32.889 --> 00:11:35.889
from all forms of danger.

00:11:35.889 --> 00:11:40.740
Brother David Schaefer, a helper to the Teaching Committee,

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.740
will now present the final talk of this symposium.

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:48.740
We can rejoice despite sword.
