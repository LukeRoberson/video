00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:29.640
I have listened to Jesus in these troublesome days.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.340
He lights up my path as I hear and obey.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.240
He is the fine shepherd, and he shows me the way.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:50.479
He guides every step, never leads me astray.

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:57.140
I should I ever listen to voices

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.140
in all position.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:02:04.239
Oh, so much more time!

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:07.239
Intent with my place in his care,

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:13.240
Surrounded by love in the faith that we share.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.240
I look to the future that you'll provide.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:34.939
His Son is my Savior with sings of love.

00:02:34.939 --> 00:03:37.659
This is a stranger that I turn into.
