00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:19.370
It's not easy raising kids in the truth, and I had 10.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.690
I learned the truth when I was 19.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:28.129
Some witnesses came to preach in our town, and my father offered them a place to stay.

00:00:28.129 --> 00:00:32.969
He spoke with them all through the night, and then announced excitedly that he had found

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:33.969
the truth.

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:38.409
Eventually, I was baptized in the 1950s.

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:43.210
My husband was favorable towards the truth, but got involved in political affairs in the

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.329
community, and from there, he began his political career.

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.850
When I read 1 Peter 3.1 and 2, I understood that I needed to be in subjection to my husband,

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.890
with the hope that he could be won over without a word by means of my conduct.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.049
When my children were young, I made a weekly Bible study program for each of them, and

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.930
as they grew up, the older kids helped me with their younger siblings.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.129
I remember mom always made an effort to teach me how to preach.

00:01:14.129 --> 00:01:19.689
I would write presentations for the ministry on pieces of paper, and the kids would practice

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:22.730
while they did their chores around the house.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.890
We set aside time one day a week for our family study.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.890
It could be anything, a sack of potatoes, a sack of flour, or a house plant.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.250
You would tell me, imagine that this is a person you meet and feel service.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.810
What would you say to them?

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.409
When I finished, she would say to me, the way you did it just now, do it like that when

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.819
you go out in the ministry.

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:49.579
My mom was very creative.

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:56.120
She would assign us to play the part of different Bible characters.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:02.000
My mom taught us to appreciate the truth, through her example.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.519
I served as a regular pioneer for many years, and I encouraged my kids to reach out for

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:09.520
spiritual goals.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.599
My daughter left home at the age of 18 to serve as a special pioneer.

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.199
Later my oldest son did the same.

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:23.039
These two proved to be excellent examples for their younger brothers.

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:25.800
Raising my son, Noa, was a challenge.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.680
He was the youngest and at a very young age, he was diagnosed with epilepsy.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:39.000
Despite his limitations, he was able to serve as a ministerial servant and regular pioneer.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.229
He fought his illness for more than 40 years, before passing away recently.

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:49.870
Losing my husband and death dealt me another blow.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.229
Now, my health and my memory are fading.

00:02:54.229 --> 00:03:00.430
I can't do as much in the ministry as before, but even so, thanks to the help of the brothers

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.740
in the congregation, I'm not giving up.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:12.580
Even though my husband was not a witness, I respected him as the head of the family.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.180
I will never forget the moment when my husband asked me to study the Bible with him.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.020
I remember that my eldest son gave the talk, and his father was among the candidates for

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.020
baptism.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.979
Forty-two years after I received the Kingdom message, my husband was baptized.

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:37.139
Another great blessing was seeing my children grow in the truth, and use their youth to

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:39.860
serve Jehovah.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:46.340
Some have served as special pioneers, circuit overseers, or imbethal.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.219
If it wasn't for her help and the support of my siblings, perhaps we wouldn't be part

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:53.219
of the organization today.

00:03:53.219 --> 00:04:02.710
But thanks to her, we started out on the best course in life, where it's cannot express

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:05.949
how grateful I am to her.

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:12.069
I now find great joy in seeing my grandchildren and great-grandchildren follow their parents

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:13.830
example.

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.029
Thinking about all I have experienced in over 60 years of service to Jehovah, raising

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:25.310
my 10 children in the truth, my husband becoming a servant of Jehovah, and seeing 30 members

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.110
of my family and full-time service.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.670
I can do nothing but thank Jehovah for his blessings.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.149
It's been worth all the effort.
