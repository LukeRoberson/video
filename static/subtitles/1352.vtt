WEBVTT

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:07.740
Yes, no matter our circumstances, the truth about Jehovah penetrates whatever beliefs

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.019
we have had in the past, as long as we have an honest heart.

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.019
That also applies to those who have committed a crime and now have been sentenced to serve

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:20.539
time in prison.

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.140
Did you know that in many countries around the world, special arrangements are being

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.460
made to preach inside prison walls?

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.140
Members involved in prison witnessing meet many individuals that express a thirst for

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.570
spiritual things.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.009
My name is Glen Monroe Hamilton.

00:00:44.009 --> 00:01:04.590
I'm in the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary, but I just need a help.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:11.709
We receive about a thousand requests each month from both men and women that are incarcerated

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:14.510
throughout the United States territory.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:20.750
We check and see what type of access the congregation might have that visiting that facility.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.469
So some congregations are able to deliver the literature, and then some congregations

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:30.829
have one of the best arrangements, which is a group Bible study.

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:35.590
Luke 418 speaks of proclaiming liberty to the captives.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.590
One way that we're doing that is through the Prison Witnessing Initiative.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.750
Our Prison Ministry program appeals to prisoners searching for answers.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.709
If they can't have physical freedom, mental freedom, and who's going to give it to them?

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:54.189
Where does it come from?

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.590
It comes from outside the prison system.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.629
Now when you think of two million people in our prison system in the United States,

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:10.110
there are several countries that have populations of two million people.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:17.990
So in effect, entering the Prison Ministry is entering another country, a country where

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:27.430
people need relief, they need understanding, they need spiritual strength and education,

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.669
they need meaning to their lives.

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:34.550
Think of it as a gated community of two million residents.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.750
That's quite a territory.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.349
My group is one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:44.550
Once I became my adolescent, I'd never wanted anyone telling me what to do.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.750
I decided I didn't want to serve Jehovah anymore.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.830
After I left Jehovah, I didn't have any type of direction.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.669
I was meeting drug dealers, hustlers, people who were just trying to do anything and everything

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:00.469
to get money.

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:09.509
I was arrested for conspiracy to sell drugs and sentenced to a long term in the federal

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:11.110
penitentiary.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.150
I eventually found the Bible.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.800
All I did was read the Bible, read the Bible, and read the Bible during that time.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:27.879
I was having a change of thinking in mind because I always knew I had to return to Jehovah.

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:32.599
Jehovah was always here, but it was just so hard to return.

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:38.080
I started writing a branch, asking for literature to come into the federal penitentiary.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:45.599
The day I met brother Shabeta, I was actually praying, supplicating, and I was saying,

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:50.319
Jehovah, Jehovah, I need to talk to somebody.

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.840
So now I hear knock on my door.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.759
And I got this man looking at him, and I'm looking at him.

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:04.759
He opens the door, looks at me, he says, are you an elder?

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:07.550
Yes.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:13.590
And then I'll never forget what he did next.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.029
The door was open and he reached out and he touched my arm.

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:21.660
He says, would you some kind of an angel or something?

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.660
I thought maybe it was nuts.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.139
An angel?

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.779
Hey buddy, I'm so far from an angel.

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:34.740
It's laughable and he laughs.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.339
He says, do you know what I was just doing?

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:40.420
No.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:47.370
I was on my knees.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.529
I was begging God to send somebody.

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:54.610
I was ready to crack.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.889
As members of the prison ministry team,

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.970
we have three basic things we plan.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.810
We plan our meetings as they would be in a local kingdom hall.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.370
And we have the inmates participate in the meetings.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.370
We have Bible study and one-on-one shepherding.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.370
We also have special events we plan for.

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.649
We have the baptism of inmates, once they progress to that point,

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:22.689
water immersion behind the prison walls.

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:26.050
We conduct a memorial passing the emblems

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.290
just as we would outside in kingdom halls

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.769
and memorial facilities once a year.

00:05:31.769 --> 00:05:35.009
Something happens to them, the changes them.

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:37.649
We teach them and shepherd them.

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:43.250
They develop a love for God and a love for others.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.209
Which a time seems uncharacteristic

00:05:45.209 --> 00:05:48.610
because they come in as messed up felons

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.490
and they leave as loving people.

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:55.730
Upon being released from prison,

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.889
my life is very different.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.490
Jehovah's just been blessed me

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.050
by having a wonderful family.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.730
Jehovah's blessed me with a wonderful, beautiful wife.

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:13.689
He has also allowed me to reach the goal of

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:16.129
becoming a regular pioneer.

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:20.050
Jehovah's also allowed me to become a ministerial servant.

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.050
It's just too many blessings, too many things to count.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.050
Without the prison ministry,

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:33.050
I probably would have never been able to be able to progress virtually.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.050
You know, so the prison ministry help us to be structured,

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.050
being taught the same Bible teachings

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.050
that people who are free have

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:46.050
is just a love and arrangement that's provided by Jehovah that's

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.050
that those men in there love and appreciate.

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.769
That I know I do, I appreciate it dearly.

00:06:51.769 --> 00:06:55.449
It's a vast prison population.

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:58.089
It is truly right for the harvest.

00:06:58.089 --> 00:06:59.970
But if you're genuine in your heart

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:03.250
about wanting to know about Jehovah,

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:04.689
he's gonna take care.

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:06.250
He's gonna watch over you.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.129
He's gonna give you what you need,

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:11.329
whether you're in prison or you're free.

00:07:11.329 --> 00:07:12.889
He's gonna take care of you.
