00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:18.149
It was very difficult to reach these territories because we had to navigate through part of the Orinoco.

00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:23.149
They come to other smaller rivers, many of their communities are far away.

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:28.149
The first time we came, we traveled on the roof of a boat.

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:34.149
We are within days, approximately seven days from a place of origin where our family is.

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:39.299
Another challenge is the language.

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:42.299
We realized that many did not understand their word.

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:47.299
In this assignment, we have come across seven different languages.

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:50.299
Initially, this was a demanding task.

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:56.299
Imagine having so much to say and not being understood.

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:58.299
We were able to overcome it.

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:03.299
But at this point, we feel that what we preach in their language,

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:05.299
it is reaching their hearts.

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:06.299
They understand.

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.299
We can see it in their face.

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.299
And that motivates them to make changes in their life.

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.299
This led a group of brothers to put forward the idea of having our own boat

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.299
for the purpose of preaching the good news of the kingdom in this area.

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:28.609
And that's when finally the project of El Precursor de la Masona was born.

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:37.609
The branch arranged for a committee to handle the task of managing and caring for the boat.

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:42.609
They also prepare the travel light in a hurry during the year.

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:47.609
They conduct important meetings such as the pre-departure meeting,

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:50.609
which aims to train the assigned passengers,

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:56.609
giving them necessary guidelines and instructions to be observed during the trip.

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:00.609
They also assign the different crews to man the boat.

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:04.609
In the morning, you get up before dawn.

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:09.610
Most, most likely, six in the morning, half past five.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.610
It's still a little dark.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.210
Morning worship is conducted at approximately seven o'clock.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.210
Some instructions are given.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:26.210
And after offering up a prayer, weed calmly at about half past seven.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.210
During the trip, there's a chance to read.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.210
There are assignments such as cleaning the boat, cooking.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.210
Actually, we stay pretty busy.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.210
And at the end of the day, we arrive at a beach or a community.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.210
Not comparison between traveling before and traveling now.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:50.210
Now we travel by limousine, east like Sirius, five stars or something like that.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.210
Yes.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.210
Travelling in seats, for example,

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.210
with a group of brothers, with a former meal service,

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.210
with electricity,

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.210
meetings are held, we consider the daily texts,

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.210
we share experiences, tell stories, we do everything.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.210
It's like being in a miniature kingdom hall, traveling for five days.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.210
We also preaching the different communities along the way.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.210
It has its own publications and a literature card.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.210
That makes it a very spiritual and a building experience for all of us.

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.580
The way the boat looked to them,

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.580
captured the indigenous people's interest.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.580
The dignified presentation of the boat is something worthy of Jova's witnesses.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.580
I also noticed that where we were sitting,

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.580
we had a little area, like a locker for each person,

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.580
that made it very comfortable.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.580
Things that didn't exist in boats for rent.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.580
El precursor del Amazonas has been a blessing for us.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.580
We were able to bring our food

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.580
and some of the things we needed, such as our refrigerator, to keep it in.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.580
Though things have been made possible,

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.580
thanks to Jova that allowed us to have this boat.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.580
At times, we have arrived at a point where we nearly run out of all the supplies.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.580
Something always happens.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.580
Brothers arrive, or El precursor del Amazonas comes.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.579
At the end, you learn to be in one,

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.579
but also to have an abundance,

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.579
seeing all this makes us feel protected,

00:04:22.579 --> 00:04:25.579
even though we are here in the middle of the jungle.

00:04:25.579 --> 00:04:29.579
People here in Amazonas know that there is a God,

00:04:29.579 --> 00:04:32.579
who gives them food, provides them the river,

00:04:32.579 --> 00:04:34.579
gives them the rain that keeps them alive.

00:04:34.579 --> 00:04:38.579
But they didn't know that Jova is that God,

00:04:38.579 --> 00:04:43.579
and that is our job to teach these people that Jova is the true God.

00:04:43.579 --> 00:04:46.579
When you see the sparkle in the eyes of your Bible students

00:04:46.579 --> 00:04:48.579
when they understand the truth,

00:04:48.579 --> 00:04:50.579
there is nothing like it.

00:04:50.579 --> 00:04:52.579
It compensates for any discomfort.

00:04:52.579 --> 00:04:54.579
That's priceless.

00:04:54.579 --> 00:04:57.579
So being in this work is the best thing you can do,

00:04:57.579 --> 00:05:00.579
because it causes true happiness.

00:05:00.579 --> 00:05:04.579
I am proud of being with the harvest people.

00:05:04.579 --> 00:05:07.579
Now, I enjoy watching the videos with my family.

00:05:07.579 --> 00:05:09.579
I conduct a family study,

00:05:09.579 --> 00:05:11.579
and I preach with my children,

00:05:11.579 --> 00:05:14.579
given the message to the people.

00:05:14.579 --> 00:05:17.579
Sometimes you have to reject Bible studies,

00:05:17.579 --> 00:05:20.579
something that seems a strange thing for Jova's witness to do.

00:05:20.579 --> 00:05:22.579
Turn down Bible studies.

00:05:22.579 --> 00:05:24.579
Rather, we always want to have studies,

00:05:24.579 --> 00:05:25.579
but there are so many,

00:05:25.579 --> 00:05:28.579
that if we start giving them all, it will be impossible.

00:05:28.579 --> 00:05:31.579
So then sometimes we choose to tell people to wait a bit

00:05:31.579 --> 00:05:34.579
and we'll return on another occasion.

00:05:34.579 --> 00:05:36.579
Sometimes up to one year will pass by.

00:05:36.579 --> 00:05:38.579
We have visited people from a year ago

00:05:38.579 --> 00:05:40.579
that had not been spoken to since,

00:05:40.579 --> 00:05:41.579
and they say,

00:05:41.579 --> 00:05:43.579
hey, a year ago you said you'd return,

00:05:43.579 --> 00:05:44.579
and now here you are.

00:05:44.579 --> 00:05:46.579
But it's been a year, brother.

00:05:46.579 --> 00:05:50.439
I feel good,

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:52.439
and I'm teaching them in Corripaco,

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:58.750
so they can speak to people about Jova in Corripaco.

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.750
To share in one of the preaching trips

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.750
of El Precosor del Amazonas

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.750
is a unique and unforgettable experience.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.750
Your faith is strengthened when you return,

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.750
and you are made more aware of the need

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.750
for additional workers for the harvest.
