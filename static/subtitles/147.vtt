00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:07.830
I would first like to read to you some passages from the Bible found at Ephesians chapter

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.750
3 verses 14 through 19.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.510
This will also establish the theme for my comments this month.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.710
Ephesians 3, starting with verse 14, Paul said,

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.190
For this reason I bend my knees to the Father to whom every family in heaven and on earth

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.070
owes its name.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.009
I pray that He may grant you through the abundance of His glory to be made mighty

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:41.210
in the man you are inside with power through His Spirit, and that through your faith

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.289
you may have the Christ dwell in your hearts with love.

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:50.869
May you be rooted and established in the foundation in order that with all the holy ones

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:57.369
you may be thoroughly able to comprehend fully what is the breadth and length and height

00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:03.909
in depth and to know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge so that you may be

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:08.670
filled with all the fullness that God gives.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:17.230
Verse 15 is the inspiration for my theme, namely glorified Jehovah, the one to whom every

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.390
family owes its name.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.829
The family unit is under a vicious attack in these last days.

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:31.590
The insight book lived up to its name under the heading family.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.109
The very insightful comment reads this way.

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:42.150
The inspired scriptures have foretold a vicious attack on the family institution with a

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:50.549
consequent breaking down of morality and of human society outside the congregation.

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:58.510
The article pointed out that in the last days a condition in which disobedience to parents,

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:05.189
disloyalty, and absence of natural affection would be rife, even among those having a

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.469
form of godly devotion.

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:16.830
How can married couples, parents, and children counteract such a diabolical attack?

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.669
Do you remember those verses we read in Ephesians chapter 3?

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:28.069
Verse 16 said that the one to whom every family owes its name, Jehovah, would grant us

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.150
to be made mighty in the person we are inside.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.150
Yes.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:40.150
Jehovah can give us the internal spiritual strength to fight back against Satan's efforts to

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.750
destroy the family.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.669
How?

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:52.590
By being immersed in God's word, in particular, by imitating the loving way that Jesus treated

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.069
his disciples.

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:01.389
Did you note that Ephesians 3, 17 said, we are to have the Christ dwell in our hearts with

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:02.389
love?

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:03.389
Yes.

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:10.469
If each of us cherishes the Christ in our hearts to the point that he dwells or resides,

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:18.110
they are constantly, our family will not only survive, but it will truly thrive.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:24.629
This will be so evident that verse 17 further states that we will be rooted and established

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:25.870
on the foundation.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.710
We will be solid.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:35.229
And keep in mind that 1 Corinthians 3, 11 says that the foundation on which we build

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:38.349
is Jesus Christ.

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:46.629
In verse 18 of Ephesians 3, it indicates that our spiritual peripheral vision will be enhanced.

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:51.509
We will not have spiritual blind spots that could allow the spirit of the world to creep

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:53.669
into the family.

00:03:53.669 --> 00:04:00.110
That verse says that we will be thoroughly able to comprehend fully what is the breadth

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.189
and length and height and depth.

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:10.310
All aspects of Jesus' personality will come into play as we interact with family members.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.389
Finally, verse 19 sums up the result when it says that we would then have come to know

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:23.149
the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge, granted.

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:30.750
Knowledge is important, but it is the application of Christ's like love that will preserve our

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.910
family, keeping it vibrantly intact.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:41.990
Family life in these critical last days could be likened to those who suffer from diabetes.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.430
It is believed that diabetes is caused by both genetic and environmental factors.

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:53.430
Similarly, all in the family have inherited sin and imperfection from our first human

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.990
parents Adam and Eve as if genetically.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:03.949
However, we are also exposed to the ever more toxic environmental factors of Satan's

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:06.389
evil world.

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:12.589
Most who suffer from a serious case of diabetes need to use two methods to successfully relieve

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:15.949
the symptoms and lead a normal life.

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:23.230
They have to watch their diet and in many cases take an injection of insulin daily.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:31.069
Virtually, we need to avoid the sickly, sweet junk food that the world promotes in movies,

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:35.910
talk shows, the internet, and in print.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:41.350
Just as with the person who has diabetes, this requires a permanent lifestyle change from

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:45.149
what we might have exposed ourselves to in the past.

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:50.910
In addition to avoiding unwholesome junk food from Satan's system, we also need to take

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:56.350
daily injections of God's Word and other wholesome provisions.

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:03.870
This has become more and more important, the deeper we get into these last days.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:09.550
How has our organization provided this when it comes to family life?

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:15.670
Well, in the early 1900s, the focus was on preaching the good news.

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:21.110
The full attention was given to building strong Christian marriages and families.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:27.389
For a time, marriage was even discouraged, well beyond the intent of the scriptures.

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:34.509
I did some checking and, commendably, between 1919 and 1921, there was a feature in the

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:40.629
Golden Age magazine once or twice a month called the Juvenile Bible Study.

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:46.870
In 1920, a brochure was released called the Golden Age ABC.

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:53.110
Then it wasn't until 1941 that the now famous book entitled Children was handed out to

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.589
all young ones at the convention that year.

00:06:57.589 --> 00:07:04.589
But as the last days progressed, more and more information for families was produced.

00:07:04.589 --> 00:07:11.230
For example, in the 1970s, the book making your family life happy was released.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:16.029
About the same time, the books listening to the great teacher and your youth getting

00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:19.069
the best out of it were published.

00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:27.149
In 1982, a wait began a regular series that has run for decades entitled Young People Ask.

00:07:27.149 --> 00:07:32.990
We now have two up-to-date books with the same title and the series of articles continues

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.670
on the JW.org website.

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:41.709
We have the book Learn from the Great Teacher and so many features and activities for young

00:07:41.709 --> 00:07:47.790
ones on the website that I would be out of time if I tried to enumerate them all.

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:54.430
There are also regular articles in our magazines about marriage and family life.

00:07:54.430 --> 00:08:01.509
And I will certainly never forget the privilege I had in 2012 to introduce the animated series

00:08:01.509 --> 00:08:04.470
Become Jehovah's Friend.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:09.550
That has proved to be a blessing for both young ones and their parents.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:14.319
What a teaching tool for both.

00:08:14.319 --> 00:08:23.079
In 2014, I attended the International Convention in Atlanta, Georgia here in the United States.

00:08:23.079 --> 00:08:28.600
After a little two-year-old girl saw my face on the big jumbo screen giving a talk,

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.720
she eagerly started searching all around her for someone.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:38.480
When her parents asked her who she was looking for, she said, Caleb, he must be here because

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:42.279
I saw his grandfather getting a talk.

00:08:42.279 --> 00:08:47.919
Many children asked to meet Caleb in person when they visit Bethel.

00:08:47.919 --> 00:08:53.919
Two postings of an item every month is making quite an impression on little hearts.

00:08:53.919 --> 00:08:59.720
With Bible principles being impressed on the minds and hearts of children so early, we

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:07.480
prayerfully anticipate many spiritually-minded teenagers in the years to come.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:14.120
We have so much healthy spiritual food for counteracting family diabetes.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:22.440
For this we give all glory to Jehovah, the one to whom every family owes its name.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:28.960
One of the favorite passages of Scripture that anyone professing to be Christian loves

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.039
is the 23rd Psalm.

00:09:32.039 --> 00:09:33.039
Family heads.

00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:40.279
Can we benefit from imitating not only the fine shepherd Jesus, but also the great shepherd,

00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:41.279
Jehovah God?

00:09:41.279 --> 00:09:48.759
I'm going to borrow the text of the 23rd Psalm and adjust the word so that we can sense

00:09:48.759 --> 00:09:53.440
a family's tranquility when headship is exercised properly.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:10:02.200
In fact, you husbands, as the Scriptures read, imagine it is your wife's voice describing

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:09.149
the effect your headship has on your family.

00:10:09.149 --> 00:10:12.870
My husband is our shepherd.

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:14.669
We will lack nothing.

00:10:14.669 --> 00:10:21.190
In grassy pastures, refreshing recreation, he makes us lie down.

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:27.230
He leads us to well-watered resting places, meetings and conventions.

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:29.269
He refreshes us.

00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:35.070
He leads us in the ministry, in the paths of righteousness for the sake of Jehovah's

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:36.590
name.

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:44.309
Though we walk in the valley of deep economic shadow, we fear no harm for dad is with

00:10:44.309 --> 00:10:45.629
us.

00:10:45.629 --> 00:10:50.149
You rod in your staff, loving discipline reassure us.

00:10:50.149 --> 00:10:56.509
You prepare a table of family worship helping the children for us before our enemies.

00:10:56.509 --> 00:10:59.269
You refresh our heads with oil.

00:10:59.269 --> 00:11:03.950
Our cup of family well-being is well-filled.

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:10.190
Surely goodness and loyal love will pursue our family all the days of our life.

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:18.080
And our family will dwell in the house of Jehovah for all our days.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.759
No further application called for.

00:11:21.759 --> 00:11:30.659
We feel the sense of security that envelops the interior rooms of such a home, don't we?

00:11:30.659 --> 00:11:36.059
Do you remember the point made in Ephesians chapter 3 which we read earlier?

00:11:36.059 --> 00:11:41.899
We are to treasure Jesus' personality and let it dwell in our heart.

00:11:41.899 --> 00:11:46.860
If all in the family make a determined effort to treat each other like Jesus would, we

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.259
can conquer the world.

00:11:49.259 --> 00:11:55.580
Yes, we, his spiritual family in heaven and all humans on earth who dedicate their lives

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:58.980
to him give glory to Jehovah.

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:05.740
Indeed, we thank Jehovah for all the spiritual provisions he's made through his word and

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:11.139
organization to protect every family who takes up his name.

00:12:11.139 --> 00:12:16.779
Made Jehovah bless all of you families as you strive to win the war that Satan wages

00:12:16.779 --> 00:12:19.700
against you in these last days.
