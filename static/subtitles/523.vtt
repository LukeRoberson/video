00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:11.419
Now, let's talk about today about unity a little bit because oftentimes when people refer to the others,

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.739
they reveal their biases. Often they want to demonstrate distance.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.399
Jesus on the contrary here in John chapter 10 verse 16

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.699
uses the term

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.100
other sheep in connection with unity. Let's read it, John chapter 10 verse 16.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.979
Jesus says here and I have other sheep which are not of this fold.

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:42.500
Those two I must bring in and they will listen to my voice and they will become one flock,

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:51.140
one shepherd. So the anointed and those with the hope of living forever on earth are united.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:59.859
Let us talk therefore about unity, unity and the memorial. And we'd like to address the

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:05.859
following questions. Why is unity so precious for us personally? What are enemies

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:12.420
into our unity and then as a third question, how will attending the memorial help us to maintain

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.060
our unity? So why is unity so precious for us personally? I guess we all treasure the harmony

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:26.180
in our family that comes from applying God's direction. The unity in the congregation and

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:33.379
in Jehovah's organization as a whole makes us feel secure and protected. We receive comfort

00:01:34.019 --> 00:01:42.340
and encouragement because we feel comfortable to open up. We do not fear that somebody would take

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:53.939
advantage of our vulnerable state. In Psalm 122 this precious unity is described and illustrated.

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:08.020
Let us read this in Psalm 122 verse 3. Jerusalem is built as a city that is joined together as one.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:16.900
The houses in Jerusalem were built close together forming a compact and easy to defend city.

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:22.900
This made it possible for the inhabitants to help and protect one another.

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:33.379
In other words, the unity we enjoy is the frame in which we can flourish and succeed. Isn't this unity

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:40.020
very valuable and precious to us? Yes. And we don't take it for granted. Now unfortunately,

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:48.180
there this unity is fragile. Why? Because there are enemies. What are these enemies that

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:55.539
us our equation number two? Now first of all, there is Satan. He was able to destroy the unity that

00:02:55.539 --> 00:03:04.500
existed between humans and Jehovah. And he still does not want us to succeed personally or as a group.

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:11.939
Since his frontal attacks have not been successful, he tries it from within by employing all kinds

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:20.340
of cunning. For example, decades ago the state secret police in one country launched heavy

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:27.300
attacks on different responsible brothers. By means of fake letters, these brothers were accused

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:34.659
of being drunkards, adulterers and traders. In another country, the secret police produced

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:40.740
falsified copies of the watchtower by twisting the content so as to serve Satan's purpose.

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:49.539
Satan will continue to employ similar tactics in the future in effort to destroy our precious

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:58.500
unity. And today, he even has modern technology at his disposal. Now the second enemy is the world.

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:06.340
We live in Satan's world and we cannot avoid being exposed to its spirit. It's a spirit of

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:15.620
independence and spirit that often promotes so-called diversity that is abhorrent. Anything goes.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:25.220
And tolerance has been redefined. The new tolerance means believing another person's position

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:33.139
is as valid or acceptable as your own. So it's not enough anymore to just acknowledge the

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:43.860
existence of different views, but you have to accept the different views themselves. Since we live

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:52.899
in this world, you can easily see that there exists the danger that its spirit affects our precious

00:04:52.899 --> 00:05:01.860
unity. Now, what about enemy number three? Enemy number three are we ourselves. How can it be

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:12.100
that we who treasure unity so much endanger it at the same time? Now, it's because we are imperfect

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:18.259
and our mistakes can lead to division. For instance, Jehovah created us with the whole

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:26.180
sum inclination to take care of ourselves. Now, unfortunately, however, there's this tendency within

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:34.579
us to go overboard with it and so pride and egotism can develop and can easily disturb unity.

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:43.759
Now, this brings us to our final question. How will attending this year's memorial help us to

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:51.759
maintain our precious unity? Now, attending our memorial certainly demonstrates our full support

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:57.759
of the anointed remnant. The unity between the two groups was prophetically pictured in

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:07.360
Sekariah chapter 8. As we read Sekariah chapter 8 verse 23, please note how close these two groups

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:14.480
are. This is Sekariah 8 verse 23. This is what Jehovah of Army says,

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:22.399
In those days, 10 men out of all the languages of the nations will take hold. Yes,

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:29.839
they will take firm hold of the rope of a Jew saying, we want to go with you,

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:40.319
for we have heard that God is with you people. Taking a firm hold of the rope and the desire to go

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:47.199
together is a clear sign of unity. The members of the other sheep are proud to associate with the

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:54.319
anointed ones knowing that Jehovah is blessing them. So even though in our congregation there may

00:06:54.319 --> 00:07:01.360
not be one of the anointed ones, we are observing the memorial shoulder to shoulder with them.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:10.879
This renews our determination not to fall prey to any of the tactics of Satan's. That is why we

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:17.439
feed exclusively at Jehovah's table. No matter what sensational stories are being told or written

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:23.920
about or aired via social media platforms, we fully trust and support the governing body

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:31.519
directed by Jesus. Now, how does attending the memorial help us to protect our unity against the

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:40.079
spirit of the world? Now, we will focus on the ransom. Jesus died for those who put faith in him

00:07:40.879 --> 00:07:49.360
and live according to Jehovah's will. This separates us from those who live according to their own

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:56.959
personal preferences. And it's not true that reflecting on Jesus' ransom helps us to set the right

00:07:56.959 --> 00:08:04.000
priorities. We put our own interest and desires in second place. We submit to Jehovah's will.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:10.240
This is our first priority. This is the key for maintaining our unity.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:17.279
Additionally, during the memorial, we focus on Jehovah's main quality of love.

00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:25.360
Out of love, Jehovah provided the ransom sacrifice. Out of love, Jesus paved the way

00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:36.799
to forgiveness of our sins. Love is a perfect bond of union, according to Colossians 3, verse 14.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:45.519
Love has the power to create unity. The unity between Jehovah and Jesus is the greatest example.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:53.440
And we want to maintain the same unity today. Therefore, we fight selfish tendencies. For

00:08:53.440 --> 00:09:00.879
example, we prove our love by our generosity and practical help. We do not spread rumor or gossip,

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:10.720
but protect one another. By doing so, we keep the damaging effects of our imperfect personality

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:21.440
on the control. So in summary, our unity is truly special and precious and we are protected. We

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:28.399
all have the responsibility to defend our unity against the influences of Satan, the world,

00:09:29.039 --> 00:09:36.000
and our imperfect personalities. Attending the memorial will be a special opportunity

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:43.759
to demonstrate full trust and support for the anointed remnant. We will be motivated to continue

00:09:43.759 --> 00:09:50.000
submitting to Jehovah's will and imitating Jehovah's and Jesus' love.
