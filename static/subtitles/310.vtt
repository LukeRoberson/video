00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.779
You bite me on everything.

00:00:02.779 --> 00:00:04.780
You're wrong about that. That is not true.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:05.780
Yes, that is true.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.779
You know I'm trying to hold this all together.

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:10.779
I'm so tired of this.

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:17.780
Every day the same thing.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.079
Fight.

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:28.179
Argue.

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:33.340
Bicker.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.340
Then silence.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.340
Meanwhile, the global financial meltdown continues to plague stocks

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.340
as market prices drop drastically once again today.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.340
China's government suspended trading early in the fears of a cell.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.829
30 years.

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.829
And this is what it's come to?

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.619
I just wanted to end.

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:05.230
We'd probably be happier divorced anyway.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:13.340
Don't understand.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.340
I need this by the end of the day on my desk

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.340
or there's going to be some consequences.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.340
You know what? I've heard enough.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.769
Goodbye.

00:01:24.769 --> 00:01:27.769
Miles divorced about two years ago.

00:01:27.769 --> 00:01:29.769
And even remarried.

00:01:29.769 --> 00:01:38.909
He doesn't seem any happier.

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.340
Marriage isn't easy.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.340
But I've become so impatient.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.340
So focused on my ones.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.340
My needs.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.340
Maybe the problem isn't who I'm with,

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.409
but who I've become.

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.409
With prayer.

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.409
Jehovah's help.

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.409
And assistance from the elders.

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:12.409
I've seen the part that I need to play.

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:14.409
To improve our relationship.

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:46.319
Our issues won't be fixed overnight.

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.319
We are working progress.

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.319
But we're learning to be more patient.

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.759
More loving.

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:59.759
And we're committed to working on it together.
