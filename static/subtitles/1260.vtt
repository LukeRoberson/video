00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.100
Seriously?

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.099
You're going?

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:07.099
Come on, Adia. It's just a party.

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:09.099
It'll be fun.

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:11.099
I don't know, Phoebe.

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.099
Look, I've been to Jessica's parties before.

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:15.099
It was totally fine.

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:16.100
Shh.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.100
Wait, you've been to our house before?

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.100
Yeah, for another party.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.100
It was great.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.100
Nothing bad happened.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.100
And guess who's going to be there?

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.100
Who?

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.100
Hey, Nadia.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.100
Hey, Jonah.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.100
Come for a little bit.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.100
And if you feel uncomfortable, you can leave.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.100
Even if I said yes, my parents would never go for it.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.100
They don't have to know. Just sneak out.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.100
That's what I do.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.100
So how about it? Have a little fun.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.100
How first Timothy 214 describes Adam?

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.579
Also, Adam was not deceived.

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:03.579
But the woman was thoroughly deceived and became a transgressor.

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.579
Adam just accepted Eve's offer.

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:10.579
He didn't think it through.

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:13.579
If I go to this party, what could happen?

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:24.379
I can't go to this party.

00:01:24.379 --> 00:01:28.379
The scripture says that Adam wasn't deceived.

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:30.379
But Eve was.

00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:35.379
Adam didn't even try to help readjust Eve's thinking.

00:01:35.379 --> 00:01:40.180
It's not enough for me not to go.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:46.180
I need to talk to Phoebe and help her see why she shouldn't go either.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:53.010
I know you're disappointed.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.010
I'm sure the elders must have their reasons.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.010
I'm sure they do.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.010
What does that mean?

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:10.139
Nothing. Just forget it.

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.139
I would decide that about your case.

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:15.139
It doesn't make any sense.

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:17.139
Not that I'm surprised.

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:27.789
Sure, I'll see you tomorrow and we'll sort this thing out together.

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:30.789
Don't worry. I'll help you fix this.

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:38.460
If I were an elder, I would never treat people like this.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:45.870
What were they thinking?

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.599
And 50 men to run before him.

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.599
What was Absalom thinking?

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.879
Wait. What am I thinking?

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:03.659
Absalom turned people away from the king.

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:07.659
Tongue them he was more just, more understanding.

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:12.909
If I take sides with Carl tomorrow, what could happen?

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:15.909
They don't even belong. They call themselves Christians.

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:17.909
To everyone.

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:19.909
They need to be out.

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:26.909
I don't know all the facts.

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:30.909
And even if I did, it doesn't matter.

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:35.909
I can't let my pride get in the way of my loyalty to Jehovah.

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:38.909
Absalom could have avoided all those bad things.

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:46.909
If he only stayed content, I need to ask Jehovah's help to root out those bad things in my heart.

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:52.599
So I can stay content.

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.599
Brother Elliot, my ex-husband won't stop calling me.

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:02.599
And every time he does call, he just brings up all of these emotions.

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:04.599
You got a text, Mr. Choney.

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:06.599
I can see what it's from.

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.599
Yeah, it's Caitlin.

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.599
She's just thanking you for listening to her today.

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.599
She seems to be talking with you a lot lately.

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:15.599
Is everything okay?

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.600
Oh, yeah. She's just going through some issues.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.600
Being newly baptized and all.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.600
She likes to bounce things off the elders.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.600
But does it always have to be with you?

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.600
Of course not.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.639
For some reason, she feels comfortable talking to me.

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:37.639
Have I ever given you any reason to be concerned over the way I shepherd sisters?

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:38.639
No, never.

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.639
So don't worry.

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.639
I'm just giving her time to get familiar with the other elders on the body.

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.639
Okay, I'm going to get ready for bed.

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:49.639
Okay, I'm going to stay up for a bit and work on my talk.

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:52.620
Okay.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.620
Avoiding the trap of overconfidence.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.620
Solomon had served Jehovah his whole life.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.620
But with time, he started relying on his own thinking.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.620
It's Caitlin again.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.620
Can you talk?

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.620
Sure I can.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:10.620
Wait a minute.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.620
I do want to help Caitlin.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:25.139
But if I'm not careful, how did I not see this?

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:27.139
I guess I just thought...

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:30.139
And that's the problem.

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:33.139
Relying on my own thinking.

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:40.990
Hey Mike, it's Terrence.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.990
Sorry to call you so late.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.990
But Caitlin just texted.

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.990
Yeah.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.990
She's been having a rough time lately.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.990
Do you think you and I can have a conference call with her?

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.990
And plan a shepherding visit?

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.990
Great.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.589
Thanks a lot.

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:04.060
Sweet.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.060
Yeah, it's fresh, ain't it?

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.060
I can make calls.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.060
I can send texts.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.060
I can do anything.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.060
All from right here.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.060
Well, cool, but how'd you get the money?

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.060
The last time I checked, you didn't have a job.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.060
There are other ways of making money, son.

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.060
Like what?

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.060
Like online betting.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.060
What?

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.060
You serious?

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.060
Yeah, I'm serious.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.060
I bet on sports teams.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.060
It's easy, it's instant money.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.060
But best of all, private.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:45.300
No one ever has to know.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.300
Here's the link.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:52.300
I wasn't even thinking about this stuff until I saw Julian's new watch.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.740
Now it's all I think about.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.790
Let me check something first.

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:01.790
Gambling.

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:03.790
Gambling is a form of greed.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.790
Whoa.

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:09.139
Judas Iscariot?

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:10.139
Started off good.

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:12.139
Gave him to greed.

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:14.139
Consumed him.

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:16.139
Betrayed Jesus.

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:19.139
If I sign up for online gambling.

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:20.139
What could happen?

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:28.470
If you leave from these things.

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:30.470
If you pursue righteousness.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:31.470
Got a diversion.

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:39.069
If I sign up for this.

00:07:39.069 --> 00:07:42.069
I could lose a lot of money.

00:07:42.069 --> 00:07:45.069
Or worse yet, I could win.

00:07:45.069 --> 00:07:48.069
And the love of money could easily consume me.

00:07:48.069 --> 00:07:50.069
Like it did Judas.

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:53.069
I could fall right out of the truth.

00:07:53.069 --> 00:07:56.069
Judas could have sought help from others.

00:07:56.069 --> 00:07:59.069
I'm going to talk to my parents about this whole thing.
