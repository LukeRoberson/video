00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:06.980
I'd like you to use your imagination for a moment, think back to when you're having

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:13.419
a conversation with someone that you respect and they're in a position of authority.

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:19.739
Now during the conversation, this person says to you, coming up to certain points and

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:24.899
they go, remember, I want you to remember this.

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:29.699
Well this is what your hope has done for us in this symposium.

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:37.880
When somebody says, remember, then most people stop in the refocus and concentrate even

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.380
more.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.340
So what does your hope want us to remember with this specific part?

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:51.500
Well, many people that are not religious can acquire faith.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:59.179
And you think about every year there's people that were atheists, agnostics that have

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:01.100
come into the truth.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:10.739
So the lesson in this part is, do not hold back from witnessing to people that are non-religious.

00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:15.659
You don't want to take the position as if we're the judge of this.

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.420
They wouldn't be interested there, atheists there, agnostics.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.500
They're wrapped up with materialism.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.060
That's not our position to take.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:34.299
We want to be individuals that Jehovah will use to try to help these non-religious individuals.

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:42.900
Now notice what Paul writes here in Romans chapter 10, and you'll find out how some have

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:49.980
changed their mind after he had exposure to the truth and Jehovah's teaching.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.540
And the only way that they could acquire faith is when this is done.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:02.939
Now notice carefully in Pay Attention Romans chapter 10, 13 through 15.

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.300
For everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.659
However, how will they call on him if they've not put faith in him?

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:20.139
How in turn will they put faith in him about whom they have not heard?

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:24.979
How in turn will they hear without someone to preach?

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:30.219
How in turn will they preach unless they have been sent out?

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:38.139
Just as it is written, how beautiful are the feet of those who declare good news of good

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:39.139
things?

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:41.379
Isn't that beautiful?

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:47.740
See this is how an individual acquires faith by answering these questions.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:53.060
Very penetrating questions that all of us want to remember when it comes to witnessing

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.860
to people that are non-religious.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.979
They need someone to share the good news with them, but to do it in such a way that touches

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:04.979
their heart.

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:05.979
And keep that in mind.

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:13.819
It isn't always just what we say, it's how we say it that matters.

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:19.139
Somebody has to share the good news with them if they're going to acquire faith.

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:26.139
So the question arises here, how can we share Bible truths in a way that non-religious

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:31.419
people are more likely to accept?

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:32.900
Good question.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.740
So helping non-religious people acquire faith, there's an important point that the Apostle

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.900
Paul shared with us in his first letter to the Corinthians.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:51.259
So find 1 Corinthians chapter 9, if you would please, 1 Corinthians chapter 9.

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:58.259
Now notice the 22nd verse, to the weak, I became weak.

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:04.860
In order to gain the weak, I have become all things to people of all sorts so that I might

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.379
think by all possible means save some.

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:10.900
That beautiful.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:18.379
What a beautiful example the Apostle Paul was with adapting to his audience.

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:24.620
He'd speak one way to the Jews, referencing the Hebrew scriptures, and then different

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.740
to the Greeks that didn't know about Jehovah God.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:35.139
So the message is to speak to them about topics that might interest them.

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.620
And we had to share this issue with you.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:49.139
The July 2019 watchtower, pages 22 through 23, and these are some points that you can keep

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:54.220
in mind when it comes to witnessing to non-religious people.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.620
Very, very good advice.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:04.860
Notice the point here, when it comes to nature, a lot of people, they might even be atheists

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.540
or agnostics, but they love nature.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.579
So using that as a basis to have a conversation is the course of wisdom.

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:20.779
You might say something like, you probably know that many inventions come about when scientists

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:24.660
copied things that already existed in nature.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:33.939
For instance, microphone designers study ears, and camera designers study eyes.

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:37.379
What comes to your mind when you think of nature?

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:42.660
Do you think that it is a marvelous force, a person, or something else?

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.540
Now listen attentively when you ask questions like that.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:53.660
And then add maybe, when engineers learn from the design of ears and eyes, we might wonder

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:56.540
whom they are learning from.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.139
I was intrigued by something an ancient poet said.

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:05.339
This is wise because the poet is the Psalmist.

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:10.660
See from Psalm 94, 910, but you could say ancient poet, that's appropriate.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:15.139
And here's the quote, the one who made the ear.

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:17.060
Can he not hear?

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.060
The one who formed the eye.

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.500
Can he not see?

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.860
He is the one who imparts knowledge to people.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.420
That beautiful.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:31.579
Good questions to ask and discuss with non-religious people.

00:06:31.579 --> 00:06:36.420
And then we have the marvelous website, JW.org.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.660
We've got the viewpoints on the origin of life.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.339
Number of videos that can help them.

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:50.019
Now at the same time, we want to have compassion, empathy, try to reach their heart.

00:06:50.019 --> 00:06:54.060
And there were some key points just to pass them on to you.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:59.259
So you want to keep in mind talking, giving a witness to non-religious people.

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:01.300
Be positive.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:07.100
See keep in mind, every year there's non-religious people that have become Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.139
This is important.

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:12.180
Be kind and tactful.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:18.620
Because people will listen not just because of what we say, but how we say it.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:23.379
See if you're going to reach your heart, speak from the heart.

00:07:23.379 --> 00:07:30.379
So be kind and tactful and imitate Jesus in the way He witnessed.

00:07:30.379 --> 00:07:33.740
Such compassion and love was always evident.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:39.860
And then this point, be understanding and listen.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:44.459
See that's so crucial to remember to listen.

00:07:44.459 --> 00:07:50.019
And since your witness is doing it, we talk too much.

00:07:50.019 --> 00:07:55.860
We ask a question and they have two seconds to answer the next thing we're talking already.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.500
But you have to listen.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:02.379
People are not being listened to today.

00:08:02.379 --> 00:08:04.699
Don't let that be us.

00:08:04.699 --> 00:08:08.220
Be understanding and listen to them.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.300
Let them express themselves.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:15.699
You show you have empathy and love for them.

00:08:15.699 --> 00:08:19.139
So keep these thoughts in mind and Jehovah bless your efforts.

00:08:19.139 --> 00:08:30.750
In fact, in the following video, notice what has attracted non-religious people to the truth.

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:34.470
My family were non-practicing Catholics.

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:38.509
So I was never taught to believe in God.

00:08:38.509 --> 00:08:43.750
I trusted my teachers more than anyone else.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:49.169
So I accepted and loved the theory of evolution.

00:08:49.169 --> 00:08:54.570
When I was 19, a childhood friend who had become one of Jehovah's Witnesses started to call

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:56.570
on me.

00:08:56.570 --> 00:09:02.370
I liked talking to him, but when he spoke to me about God, I told him, please stop talking

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:07.049
about God because I don't believe in Him.

00:09:07.049 --> 00:09:09.649
He never gave up on me.

00:09:09.649 --> 00:09:17.450
He asked, why won't you just for a moment entertain a conversation about God?

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:19.970
This question made me think.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:25.169
I had rejected his arguments without even listening to them.

00:09:25.169 --> 00:09:31.340
I didn't want to give the impression of being arrogant or stubborn.

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:37.100
So I thought, why not let him speak?

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.220
He used a book, Life.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:43.820
How did it get here by evolution or by creation?

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:47.580
It was as if a veil had been lifted from my eyes.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:51.940
That was the moment Jehovah introduced himself to me.

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:57.659
Finally, I understood that my life has a purpose.

00:09:57.659 --> 00:10:05.220
I regret that I didn't know Jehovah for the first 20 years of my life.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:11.139
My relationship with Jehovah is without doubt the most precious thing I have.

00:10:11.139 --> 00:10:18.139
I am determined to witness about Jehovah to everyone I meet, especially to those without

00:10:18.139 --> 00:10:30.210
faith, so that they too can appreciate the wonderful qualities of our Creator.

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:36.809
Yes, non-religious people are accepting the truth.

00:10:36.809 --> 00:10:43.610
They can acquire faith, and those beautiful experiences prove that point.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:51.129
So again, we say, remember, faithless people can acquire faith.

00:10:51.129 --> 00:11:00.210
You think back to the Ninevites, Jesus' fleshly brothers, and Pramina Jews, they all made

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:02.649
great changes.

00:11:02.649 --> 00:11:08.690
And today, as in the past, here's what's happening as mentioned here in 1st Timothy, chapter

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:20.450
2, where it mentions in the 4th verse about Jehovah's will, whose will is that all sorts

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:25.409
of people should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.

00:11:25.409 --> 00:11:27.009
That's Jehovah's will.

00:11:27.009 --> 00:11:31.529
We've dedicated our life to him to do Jehovah's will.

00:11:31.529 --> 00:11:39.850
So all sorts of people are acquiring faith in Jehovah year after year.

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:47.610
So we encourage you to give a bold, but tactful witness to your unbelieving relatives, as

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:53.049
well as to Prominent ones and to non-religious people.

00:11:53.049 --> 00:12:00.169
Now, as we continue to preach to all, Jehovah will make it grow.

00:12:00.169 --> 00:12:03.610
Jehovah will bless our efforts.

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:12.649
Remember, Jehovah can stir the hearts of any person and cause them to acquire faith.
