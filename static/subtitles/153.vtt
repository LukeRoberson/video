WEBVTT

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.150
We have selected the theme be a champion of truth

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.429
You may have heard of the word champion used in the context of sports

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.150
What is a champion?

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.150
The word can have different meanings

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.670
The word is related to the French word

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.670
Shaw meaning field that word has its origin in the Latin word

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.269
Compass also meaning field or battlefield

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:34.270
The Bible speaks of a champion on a battlefield in 1 Samuel chapter 17 and verse 4

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:42.320
Then a champion came out from the camps of the Philistines his name was Goliath

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:51.039
Goliath was a champion for a wrong cause namely to take the lead in defeating the ancient Israelites in battle

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:01.759
In our modern time according to one definition a champion is an ardent defender or supporter of a cause or another person

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:06.959
Christians today are ardent defenders and supporters of the truth

00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:12.799
The watchtower of January 15, 2012 said on page 8

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:14.400
quote

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.799
Other champions of Bible truth rose up in the centuries that followed

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:26.719
Yes, before the watchtower said this magazine will never shrink in fear from championing the truth

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.000
The watchtower has been championing the cause of kingdom truth

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:41.920
So are you a champion in a sports competition only one individual gets to be the champion

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.040
But in the case of true Christians all can be champions of the truth

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.799
All Christians are to defend the truth and become conquerors winners

00:01:54.239 --> 00:02:00.640
It's necessary to defend the truth because in today's world truth is being attacked and distorted

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.680
We are surrounded by a sea of lies and misrepresentations

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:08.879
How did such lies get started?

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.520
They started in the Garden of Eden when Satan told Eve lies

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:19.360
Satan through his deceptive statements became the father of the lie

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.560
All the problems in the world all calamities also your personal calamities

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.759
All wars these all diseases all crimes all unhappiness

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:37.439
sorrow and death started with the original lies in the Garden of Eden

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.240
Satan is the father of the lie but today there are many children of the lie

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:49.599
Every one of us is affected we are surrounded by a sea of lies

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:56.479
A lie is a false statement deliberately presented as being true a falsehood

00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:00.000
A lie is the opposite of the truth

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.719
Lying involves saying something incorrect to a person who is entitled to know the truth about a matter

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.719
But there is also something that is called a half truth

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.120
The Bible tells Christians to be honest with each other

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:23.199
Now that you have put away the seat speak truth broke the Apostle Paul at Ephesians 4.25

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.199
Lies and half truth undermine trust

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:33.599
A German proverb says who lies once is not believed even if he says the truth

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.719
So we need to speak openly and honestly with each other

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:44.719
Not withholding bits of information that could change the perception in the listener or mislead him

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:52.719
As to lies there are different types some politicians have lied about matters they wanted to keep secret

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.080
Companies sometimes lie in advertisements regarding their products

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.599
What about the news media many tried to report events

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:12.879
Truthfully but we should not be gullible and believe everything newspapers write or everything we hear on radio or sea on television

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:24.319
Then there are religious lies if Satan is called the father of the lie then Babylon the great the global empire of false religion can be called the mother of the lie

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.600
Individual false religions could be called daughters of the lie

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.279
Some lie by saying that sinners will get tormented in hell forever

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.920
Others lie by saying once saved always saved

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:48.480
Again others lie by saying that the earth will be burned up on judgment day and all good people will go to heaven

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:51.120
Some worship idols

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.920
Paul wrote in Romans chapter 1 and 25

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:06.079
They exchanged the truth of God for the lie and venerated and rendered sacred service to the creation rather than the creator

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:12.079
Then there are many lies of a personal nature that people express in everyday life

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:19.759
The businessmen may get a phone call but tell his secretary to answer the caller by saying he's not in

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.120
This may be considered a small lie

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.480
There are small lies big lies and malicious lies

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:36.560
A child may have broken something but when asked initially out of fear of punishment denies having done it

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:40.079
This does not make the child a malicious liar

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:49.279
In contrast what even entrepreneur tells his bookkeeper to falsify the entries in the books in order to save on taxes

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.240
This lying to the tax office is certainly a serious lie

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.680
It is a deliberate attempt to mislead somebody that has the right to know

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.879
It also robs the government of what they have established as legal income

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.720
We can see that not all lies are the same

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:13.199
They are small lies big lies and malicious lies

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:18.480
Satan is a malicious liar. He is the champion of the lie

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.680
Since Jehovah hates liars

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.000
We should avoid all lies not just big or malicious lies

00:06:28.079 --> 00:06:30.079
But can we find the truth?

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:33.360
Some say truth is relative

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.079
It is like saying this is truth for you and this is truth for me

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:42.720
This claim is not logical when it comes to religious truth

00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:46.079
Either God is a Trinity or he is not

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:49.519
Either the soul is mortal or it is not

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:54.000
Either there is a future paradise on earth or there is not

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.360
Either homosexuality is acceptable to God or it is not

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:04.319
Either participating in wars is permissible or it is not

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:11.600
Truth is definite not relative because Jehovah conveyed the truth to his servants

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.480
Some 43 verse 3 says

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:17.199
Send out your light and your truth

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.439
Jehovah is a revealer of truth

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.360
One of several reasons why Jesus came into the world is to witness to the truth

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:33.279
At the John 1837 B he said

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:40.000
For this I have been born and for this I have come into the world that I should bear witness to the truth

00:07:40.959 --> 00:07:44.800
Everyone who is on the side of the truth listens to my voice

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:51.759
So if we listen to Jesus or read in the Bible what he thought we can learn the truth

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:55.360
Jesus was the personification of the truth

00:07:55.519 --> 00:07:59.920
He said I am the way and the truth and the lie

00:08:01.519 --> 00:08:05.759
We can't find out what the truth is by diligently studying the Bible

00:08:06.399 --> 00:08:08.959
Truth is that which is effect

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:15.759
For true Christians the entire text of the Hebrew and Christian Greek scriptures constitutes the truth

00:08:16.879 --> 00:08:20.720
Some 19 verse 160 says of Jehovah

00:08:21.439 --> 00:08:24.399
The essence of your word is truth

00:08:25.759 --> 00:08:32.399
That is why it is good to do daily Bible reading with meditation and weekly family worship

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:38.799
At Matthew 24, 45 to 47 we read that for the time of the end

00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:49.919
Jesus would appoint a faithful and discreet slave or governing body to explain the Bible to his followers and help them to grow in understanding of the truth

00:08:50.559 --> 00:08:58.799
Where as Jesus teachings and the written word of God are inspired the faithful and discreet slave is not inspired

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.600
Although it champions the truth

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.799
Nevertheless the faithful slave provides spiritual food

00:09:07.759 --> 00:09:14.399
Whereas in the first century there was supernatural knowledge available for apostles and Bible writers

00:09:14.799 --> 00:09:19.600
In the time of the end Jehovah does not bestow this miraculous gift anymore

00:09:20.159 --> 00:09:23.919
As explained at 1 Corinthians 138

00:09:25.519 --> 00:09:33.919
Although there is no divine inspiration today still Jesus leads his people progressively through the services of the faithful slave

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:41.039
Jesus trust that the imperfect faithful slave will do its best to convey spiritual food

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.480
Do you also trust the slave

00:09:46.669 --> 00:09:49.230
Where as the truth of God's word does not change

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:54.590
Our understanding of the truth does change because we are not perfect yet

00:09:55.549 --> 00:10:00.029
We understand more about the truth today than Christians in the first century

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:04.750
Do we keep up with the progressive understanding of truth

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:07.950
Daniel was told

00:10:08.029 --> 00:10:12.830
Many will rove about and the true knowledge will become abundant

00:10:13.549 --> 00:10:17.870
This is a gradual process. We are still roving about

00:10:19.309 --> 00:10:23.549
During the millennium Jehovah will reveal additional truth to mankind

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:30.110
At Revelation 2012 it mentions scrolls that will be opened

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:37.950
The Apostle John reports that the dead are to be judged out of those things written in the scrolls according to their deeds

00:10:38.909 --> 00:10:46.590
Evidently then these scrolls will contain additional information for mankind during the thousand years

00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:52.429
It stands to reason that after the end of the millennium there will be additional truths to learn

00:10:53.629 --> 00:10:54.830
Still

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:56.830
According to Ecclesiastes

00:10:57.549 --> 00:10:59.549
3 verse 11

00:11:00.909 --> 00:11:04.750
Mankind will never find out the work that the true God has made

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:08.350
But how do we know we have the truth

00:11:09.389 --> 00:11:15.389
At Pentecost 33 of our common era true Christians numbered only about 3000

00:11:16.269 --> 00:11:23.870
Today we are millions and on average every weekend more than 5000 are getting baptized

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:28.669
But this in itself is not proof that we have the truth

00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:31.389
Truth is not measured in numbers

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:34.509
Why do we know we have the truth

00:11:35.789 --> 00:11:40.990
For one because we remain in Jesus teaching John 831

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:49.230
Second we know we have the truth because of the deep bond of love for each other John 1335

00:11:50.909 --> 00:11:57.549
Third we know we have the truth because our conduct adheres to the high moral standards of truth

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:00.590
John 1510

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:09.789
Fourth we know we have the truth because we remain neutral in the controversies of the world as Jesus advised at John 1714

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:15.629
Fifth we know we have the truth because we are God's name people

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:20.429
Acts 1514 speaks of a people for his name

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:24.590
Jesus said the truth will set you free

00:12:25.629 --> 00:12:30.190
It sets us free from fears like the fear of death fear of the future

00:12:30.669 --> 00:12:32.830
And an exaggerated fear of man

00:12:33.549 --> 00:12:36.029
It also sets us free from false teachings

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:40.029
From spiritism and from astrology and magic

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:43.789
It frees us from immorality and its consequences

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:50.029
There are no other people on earth that are as spiritually free as we are

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:53.070
Do we appreciate that freedom

00:12:54.029 --> 00:13:02.509
Truth leads to freedom. Second Corinthians 317 says where the spirit of Jehovah is there is freedom

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:07.389
The truth penetrates schools. How so?

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:12.509
By means of our children who preach the truth to classmates and to teachers

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:17.470
Do you go to school? Do you champion the truth at school?

00:13:18.429 --> 00:13:22.990
How can you do this? You do this not only by preaching but also by your

00:13:24.029 --> 00:13:31.470
By your dress and grooming and by taking a stand for the truth when others want you to participate in un-Christian practices

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:37.789
You also champion the truth by remaining honest and not cheating on your exams

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:40.590
And Jehovah will love you for that

00:13:42.029 --> 00:13:44.269
The truth also penetrates prisons

00:13:45.309 --> 00:13:52.429
Reports have come in from many countries telling of the good work brothers are doing in contacting prisoners in various prisons

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:56.110
Helping some to rehabilitate their lives spiritually

00:13:57.149 --> 00:14:06.110
In a number of such institutions regular meetings are being held and several prisoners have studied to the point of dedication and baptism

00:14:07.629 --> 00:14:13.789
The truth penetrates even walls of monasteries in Mexico in 2009

00:14:14.269 --> 00:14:22.190
Anun was baptized who because of the truth had left her monastery and order although she was the mother superior

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:25.950
The world is in utter confusion

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:28.909
What a blessing to know the truth

00:14:29.629 --> 00:14:35.389
We rejoice in it. We have the truth on our lips. We have the truth around our hips

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:41.230
Ephesians chapter 6 says that the belt of truth is fastened around our wastes

00:14:42.429 --> 00:14:44.350
We are ready to teach it

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:47.870
We talk the truth and we walk in the truth

00:14:48.509 --> 00:14:52.269
And those who continue to walk in the truth will walk in it forever

00:14:53.549 --> 00:14:57.149
Help your students to love the truth and to live the truth

00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:01.789
But if necessary to be willing to die for the truth and for Jehovah

00:15:03.389 --> 00:15:07.389
The truth is invincible and we'll conquer this wicked world

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:13.629
In some countries we may have many enemies who may want to silence us

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:20.269
But the Apostle Paul said at 2nd Corinthians chapter 13 verse 8

00:15:20.909 --> 00:15:24.750
For we can do nothing against the truth

00:15:26.669 --> 00:15:29.230
Neither can our enemies suppress the truth

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:33.950
Do we appreciate that we have the truth? The only truth?

00:15:35.149 --> 00:15:40.909
Is this arrogant to say by no means it would be a sin if we would not say so

00:15:41.309 --> 00:15:44.909
Jesus was not arrogant when he said I am the truth

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:50.509
To know the truth is not enough. We need to champion it

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:53.629
There are still many lovers of truth out there

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:56.110
Search for them

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:58.110
Who will help you in the search

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:05.710
According to John 4 23, Jesus said that Jehovah is searching for ones that want to worship in truth

00:16:07.149 --> 00:16:12.110
The majority will not listen to the truth because they love the darkness rather than the light

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:20.269
The truth may expose their sinful conduct and they may not have the humility to want to repent and change

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:24.590
We still have to preach to them to warn them

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:29.149
Ezekiel was told you must warn them from me

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:32.269
The principle applies to us as well

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:36.990
Paul speaks of the sword of God's word

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:40.509
Use it well to champion the truth

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:44.990
Train your students to be good defenders of it as well

00:16:46.429 --> 00:16:49.389
The time will come in paradise after the final test

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:57.309
When it will not be necessary to champion or defend the truth because nobody will attack it anymore

00:16:58.509 --> 00:17:08.029
Right now whether we are adults, teenagers or children let us follow and imitate Jesus the greatest champion of truth

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:17.150
To that end keep studying the truth keep spreading the truth keep loving the truth and Jehovah the God of truth

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:22.509
Hold fast to the truth as to a lifeline as this is what it is

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:28.910
By staying faithful whether you survive Armageddon or are resurrected in paradise

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:32.910
You will be a victorious champion of the truth
