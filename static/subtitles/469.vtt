00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:09.060
Well, I think we'd agree that it's very hard-warming to know that we serve a God of comfort.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.300
And he provides us with so many reminders that highlight the need for us to encourage,

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:20.019
strengthen, and comfort one another, especially now in the times in which we live, because

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:25.460
none of us know the full weight of what our brothers here in the Bethlehem family and

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.379
our congregations might be facing or dealing with.

00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:37.740
So having and showing empathy, fellow feeling towards one another is so important.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:43.859
Perhaps a good example of how not to show comfort and fellow feeling is described for

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:47.060
us by Job's three comforters.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.619
You might recall they were so busy judging him and giving Job speeches that they failed

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:58.060
to take the time to understand him and to show fellow feeling.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:05.980
In fact, in all the talking they did, not once do we read that they even address Job by name.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.219
The watchtower made a statement regarding these comforters.

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:18.260
It said, evidently, they view Job more as a problem than as a person.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.459
Now how do you think that treatment made Job feel?

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:30.180
It's a term with many of your Bibles to Job chapter 19, and we'll listen to Job's words.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:37.969
Job chapter 19 verse 2.

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:46.849
He says, How long will you keep irritating my soul, crushing me with words?

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:48.609
How sad.

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:57.209
Instead of providing encouragement and comfort, those companions only made Job feel irritated,

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:00.969
crushed and frustrated.

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:06.450
What doesn't this highlight that if we don't give thoughts to our words and actions,

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.650
if we view our brother more as a problem than as a person, then we're not going to be

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.250
able to provide them with the comfort and support they may need.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.250
Perhaps we might work with or wear in the congregation with someone that has faults or

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.090
traits that bother us.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.530
Maybe that these faults are actually legitimate causes of concern.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.449
But in our dealings with them, if those faults are the only thing that we can see, if that's

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:43.810
the only thing we focus on, then it's going to be very difficult for us to see them as

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.009
a faithful fellow worker of Jehovah.

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:52.930
More than likely, all we're going to see is someone who is an obstacle or impediment

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.969
to our work.

00:02:54.969 --> 00:03:00.050
Someone that is affecting or impacting our production and joy.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.169
And certainly, we're not going to feel good because now we've developed negative feelings

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:11.969
about our brother and our brother is likely going to feel the spirit that we give off.

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:13.689
And how's that going to affect them?

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:20.370
Well, like Job, likely they're going to be frustrated, irritated, and we've only added

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.210
to their anxiety.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.250
Well, obviously none of us want to have that sort of effect on our brothers.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:35.530
And that's why Paul's words to the Thessalonians are a good example worthy of imitation.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.969
When we look at this congregation practically from the beginning, the congregation that

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:45.889
was established in Thessalonica, those brothers and sisters experienced persecution.

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:51.050
In Acts chapter 17, it mentions that fanatical Jews stirred up mom violence, prompting

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.889
the brothers to send Paul and Silas away for their personal safety.

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:01.569
Another issue that was affecting the congregation was that they seemingly expressed great sorrow

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.009
over losing ones of their number and death.

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:07.009
So now you think about that.

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:08.009
You have the full picture.

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:12.569
Here you have a brand new congregation and they're feeling the heat and pressure of intense

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.689
persecution from the outside.

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:23.129
And then on the inside, they're feeling the pain of losing loved ones in death.

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:31.089
Does that congregation in need of comfort and encouragement without question?

00:04:31.089 --> 00:04:36.089
But interestingly, in the midst of all of this persecution and sadness, it was also

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:42.129
discovered that those Christians were dealing and struggling with some personal weaknesses.

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:46.689
You look at 1 Thessalonians chapter 4, and there they were counseled to abstain from

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:51.889
fornication, to love one another in fuller measure, to mind their own business, to work

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:58.009
with their hands, then chapter 5, to stay awake spiritually, and to abstain from every

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:03.810
form of wickedness at a number of other matters that needed attention.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:10.370
Now each of those matters were all legitimate causes of concern.

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:15.170
In fact, Paul felt this was so urgent that he sent them a second letter, which closely

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:22.089
followed his first, but what was Paul going to focus on?

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:27.209
Would he focus on the problem or the people?

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:29.649
Turn with me please to 2 Thessalonians chapter 1.

00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:38.079
Let's note how Paul begins this chapter, 2 Thessalonians chapter 1.

00:05:38.079 --> 00:05:43.889
And we'll read his words beginning in verse 3.

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:48.930
He says, we are obligated always to give thanks to God for you brothers.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:55.009
This is fitting, because your faith is growing exceedingly, and the love of each and every

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:58.449
one of you is increasing toward one another.

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:03.529
As a result, we ourselves take pride in you among the congregations of God, because of

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:10.769
your endurance and faith in all your persecutions and the hardships you are suffering.

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:11.769
How beautiful.

00:06:11.769 --> 00:06:15.129
Paul starts with specific commendation.

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:21.529
Yes, there were problems that needed to be addressed, but he starts with their good qualities,

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:24.250
what they were doing right.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:29.250
Can you and I do the same in our dealings with our brothers?

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.810
Instead of first thinking what they're doing wrong, what do they do right?

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.610
What do we appreciate about them?

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.529
Isn't it so much better to focus on their good traits?

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:47.009
The benefits of doing this is that it helps us to develop genuine personal interest in

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:52.769
our brothers, because the far brothers can sense that we truly care about them, that it

00:06:52.769 --> 00:06:59.329
actually puts us in a better position to assist them with any matters that may need adjustment.

00:06:59.329 --> 00:07:03.810
And what we'll find is that this personal interest can start with something as simple

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.209
as acknowledgement.

00:07:06.209 --> 00:07:13.410
We recall Job's false comfortors didn't even address Job by name, but the young man Elihu,

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:19.170
when he was given the opportunity to speak, when addressing Job, he respectfully addressed

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.769
him by name.

00:07:21.769 --> 00:07:25.730
Job chapter 33 verse 1, Elihu begins his words by saying,

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:31.009
Job, please, hear my words.

00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:36.569
And there were many other verses where he used Job's personal name as well.

00:07:36.569 --> 00:07:41.329
I think we'd agree sometimes it can be so easy, especially for us as brothers to get

00:07:41.329 --> 00:07:47.209
into work mode, business mode, where we're just so focused on getting information, whether

00:07:47.209 --> 00:07:53.050
it's here at Bethel or in the congregation, we could completely forget to acknowledge

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:57.009
or even greet the brother in front of us.

00:07:57.009 --> 00:08:01.490
So what a beautiful reminder we learned from Elihu.

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:07.730
Now we go back to Paul after his commendation in 2 Thessalonians chapter 1.

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:13.850
He starts chapter 2 of 2 Thessalonians with the word, however.

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:18.129
So now they're the contrast, they're the shift in wording, and he begins to address

00:08:18.209 --> 00:08:23.209
the problem some had developed regarding a wrong view of Christ's presence.

00:08:23.209 --> 00:08:28.970
So we learned from this that Paul did not sugarcoat or overlook issues that needed to be

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:30.449
addressed.

00:08:30.449 --> 00:08:32.529
He handled them.

00:08:32.529 --> 00:08:38.529
But he did it in such a way where the brothers were still able to feel his loving care

00:08:38.529 --> 00:08:40.330
and concern.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:46.450
In fact, if you look in verse 13, you'll notice he uses the word, however, again.

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:54.169
So another shift, but this time shifting back to words of empathy, love, and exhortation

00:08:54.169 --> 00:08:56.049
for his brothers.

00:08:56.049 --> 00:09:03.210
Paul was convinced he had a positive conviction that his brothers would do the right thing.

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:09.769
So in review, if we want to be a source of comfort and encouragement to our brothers,

00:09:09.769 --> 00:09:16.409
how important it is that we see them not as a problem, not as an impediment to our work,

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:19.690
but as our fellow worker.

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:26.289
And instead of judging, we commend showing genuine personal interest and acknowledgement.

00:09:26.289 --> 00:09:31.450
And if there is a legitimate issue of concern, well, we can lovingly address what needs

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:38.450
to be addressed, but always be remembered more for our encouragement than our counsel.

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:43.889
And we're able to do this than our brothers are going to love us for the way that we deal

00:09:43.889 --> 00:09:44.889
with them.

00:09:44.889 --> 00:09:51.210
But more importantly, our Heavenly Father, our God of comfort, he will love us as well.
