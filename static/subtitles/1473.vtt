00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.279
The governing body and analyzing the needs of the world field

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:15.279
deserves that there is a need for more missionaries.

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:20.280
The process for identifying new field missionaries has changed.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.280
Gilliet is no longer the pool from which field missionaries are drawn.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.280
Graduates of the School for Kingdom Evangelizers

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.280
are now the ones from whom we draw field missionaries.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.280
They'll serve as temporary special pioneers

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.280
and on a yearly basis, the Branch Committee will evaluate their activity.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.280
And then those who have the potential are recommended to the service committee

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.280
as potential field missionaries.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.280
On April 2015, a new arrangement went into effect

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.280
affecting the field missionary work.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.280
Before, missionaries were assigned

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.280
if for an indefinite period of time or perhaps a lifetime in missionary service.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.280
The governing body approved an adjustment

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.280
whereby newly appointed field missionaries receive a three-year assignment.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.280
Towards the end of that assignment,

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.280
if they wish to continue on,

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.280
the service committee will consider the request

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.280
and perhaps continue them on in their missionary assignment.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.280
The Branch sent us a letter and an application to be candidates for missionary service.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.280
We didn't go to Gilliet.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.459
When I received a three-year assignment,

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:35.459
it made me feel very reassured.

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:37.459
We knew that in three years,

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:39.459
we'd really know what it was like in order to see

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:42.459
if we wanted to make this our life's career.

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:44.459
When I came into the truth,

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:48.459
it was with the help of two missionary sisters.

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:49.459
In the early days,

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:52.459
it was primarily through missionaries

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:54.459
that the work got expanded.

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:57.459
What we have seen now is that

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:01.459
the missionaries can have a real powerful effect

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:04.459
to strengthen the organization in areas

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:07.459
where perhaps we have enormous growth.

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:09.460
Many, many people coming in the truth.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.460
Now we need these mature ones

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.460
to be in the congregations to strengthen the field.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.460
But at the same time,

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.460
to also spearhead the preaching work,

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.460
helping these new ones to become

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.460
established preachers of the good news.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.460
The missionaries come here with a very positive attitude.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.460
They're willing to work hard

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.460
and just give the best both in the congregation and in the field.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.460
But what I love about missionary services

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.460
being able to spend most of my time with the friends.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.460
We can serve our brothers and sisters

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.460
and our Bible students without other distractions.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.460
Many of the deaf here

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.460
they feel isolated and rejected by society.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.460
Serving as a missionary has enabled me

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.460
to help many deaf to get on

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.460
and stay on the road to life.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.460
Many local psychosis have been trained

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.460
in some way by missionaries.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.460
But they're good example and hard work.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.460
They definitely raised the standard

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.460
in the entire branch territory.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.460
Because of the beautiful example

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.460
of the missionaries,

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.460
now young ones view full-time service

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.460
as the best way of life.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.460
The loving training given by the missionaries

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.460
has had a tremendous effect

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.460
on the kingdom work in Myanmar.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.460
They patiently trained the local brothers

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.460
to take on more responsibility

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.460
in Jehovah's organization.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.460
In the governing body,

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.460
we have three brothers who served

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.460
in the missionary field for this Jackson,

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.460
for the Loach, for the Splain.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.460
So we can see that these brothers

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.460
have grown through the missionary service

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.460
and now serve very effectively

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.460
on the governing body.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.460
The governing body deeply loves the missionaries.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.460
We take our responsibility

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.460
to preach the good news very, very seriously.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.460
And we know that it can only be done

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.460
if we have capable, qualified people

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.460
who are jealous, who love Jehovah,

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.460
and who are able to really love the brothers

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.460
and love the people in the field

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.460
so that they can help them to grow spiritually

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.459
and help them to follow in their footsteps

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.459
the good example that they're sending.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.459
All this contributes to the fulfillment

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:23.459
of the prophecy about the preaching

00:04:23.459 --> 00:04:26.459
of the good news to all the inhabited earth

00:04:26.459 --> 00:04:30.459
and missionaries have played a big role in that

00:04:30.459 --> 00:04:33.459
in the fulfillment of this prophecy.
