00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:08.130
An excellent way of maintaining the spirituality of the family is by spending quality time

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.689
together in the ministry.

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:15.050
We would now like to introduce you to a family from Russia.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:21.489
They traveled far away to work together in unassigned territory in Siberia.

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:28.850
Their experience confirms how spiritual activities not only build our faith, but can also bring

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:38.659
our family closer to each other.

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:42.659
We are traveling to a very interesting territory.

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:45.579
It is on the shores of Lake Baikal.

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.060
From where we live, it is 600 kilometers.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.740
We have so many memories to take home.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.979
The scenery is always stunning in all types of weather.

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:02.259
Here there are beautiful cleaves and valleys.

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:05.180
We cross several mountain passes.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.299
Then we go by ferry.

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:13.459
It felt very strange being in the car while crossing the river.

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:17.620
When we have the opportunity, we witness to people we meet on the way.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.659
Why do sincere people trust the Holy Scriptures?

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.140
Please have a look at what it says here.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.459
All Scripture is inspired of God.

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:33.659
We usually serve an isolated territory for a week or more.

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.340
We have come to the same place where we were last year.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.620
So we already know a lot about it.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.459
Living in a tent is very different from living in this city.

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:49.340
Here we don't have any conveniences like a toilet or shower.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.739
The only place to watch is in Lake Baikal, which is freezing.

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:58.939
This simple life is like an adventure.

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.900
Since we have quite a big group, there are 12 of us.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.939
We have also organized our spiritual routine.

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:12.659
We consider the daily text together and take part in discussing our publications using the

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:14.460
questions.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.020
We have a friendly relaxed atmosphere.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.659
Everybody enjoys it.

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:25.659
Our isolated territory where we are preaching is a rural area.

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:28.219
Here we don't have any prepared maps.

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:37.139
So when we have our meetings for field service, we divide up all taking different streets.

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:40.580
We also think about what clothes to wear.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.460
Experience has shown that our clothes can help us to win over these people.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.740
So we try to dress simply.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.000
We don't wear ties.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.400
The people there are kind, sometimes they even invite us in.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.680
We can have discussions with some of them, sometimes long ones.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:10.039
There you meet more receptive people than unresponsive ones, and that really is encouraging.

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:15.080
It makes you just want to keep on preaching without stopping.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.680
The trips have helped our son make spiritual progress.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.759
For us as his parents, that is the greatest blessing.

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:28.879
For example, after one of these trips, he became an unbaptized publisher.

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.879
This territory is different from what I am used to, so I was worried.

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:40.319
I didn't know what sort of people lived there or what their attitude was towards witnesses,

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.000
but after praying when knocking the first door, my fear disappeared.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.840
I was able to place two hundred and seven detracts.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.360
While we were witnessing, we showed the people the addresses in our publications, so that

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.039
they could write if they found what they had read interesting.

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:05.439
We usually start witnessing about 12 noon, and we finish around 5 pm, then the relaxation

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:13.139
part of our day begins.

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:18.060
We have a campfire, some games, some music, and fun.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.620
Early in the day, we used our energy in the ministry, and afterwards, we were able to

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.259
relax and enjoy each other's company.

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:30.579
So we combine both our ministry and relaxation.

00:04:30.579 --> 00:04:39.300
One of the delights of these trips is the fish, the famous Bicol Omo.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.180
These trips really strengthen the unity and our family.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.939
We really have drawn closer together.

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:51.060
It is invigorating and enriches us spiritually.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.500
We experience pure joy from knowing that Jehovah has blessed our efforts.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:08.209
We feel like we have our batteries charged for the entire year.

00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:15.050
It is very encouraging to see such a spiritually focused family, and did you notice that it was

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.370
after one such trip that their son became an unbaptized publisher?

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.889
And I'm sure that brought much joy to his parents.

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:29.810
Are you interested in a preaching assignment and territory seldom worked?

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:35.850
If so, form a group of no more than 20 publishers and ask the elders in your congregation for

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:41.610
further instructions and an application for territory seldom worked.

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.850
Once you have filled out the form, the Congregation Service Committee will review it and submit

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.689
it to your local branch.
