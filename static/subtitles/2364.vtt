00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:18.100
A strong marriage can be an oasis of peace in a difficult world.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:29.500
But no matter how strong the bond, every marriage consists of an imperfect man and an

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:49.520
imperfect woman living in a confined space.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:56.600
Even in a happy marriage, disagreements can arise that lead loving spouses to use hurtful

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.600
words.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:07.180
At a certain point, you may not even remember how the disagreement started, and yet the conflict

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.000
escalates.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:23.019
As this ever happened to you, did you apologize and make things right?

00:01:23.019 --> 00:01:30.060
The mere passing of time won't make the hurt disappear.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:38.670
The real triumph, peace, can only come about with a sincere apology.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.829
You nothing out of contentiousness or out of egotism, but with humility, consider others

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:49.719
superior to you.

00:01:49.719 --> 00:02:41.449
Try to see things from your spouse's viewpoint.

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:50.210
How would a sincere apology make you feel?

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:58.009
Don't let your ego get in the way.

00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:02.569
Take responsibility for your part in the dispute.

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.409
Even if you don't think you've done anything wrong.

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:10.569
Knowledge the hurt you've caused your spouse.

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.370
And be quick to accept each other's sincere apologies.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:28.530
Peaceful relationships are worth much more than pride or victory, but peace in the family

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:58.120
must be maintained.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.840
It can be easy to focus on your mate's flaws.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:13.039
But when you feel like you're being pushed to your limit, remember, James 3, verse 2 says,

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:23.389
we all stumble many times.

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:29.709
The quicker you apologize, no matter who is to blame, the faster you restore the peace

00:04:29.709 --> 00:04:34.899
and happiness in your family.

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:41.500
When you sincerely apologize and accept your mate's apology, you put your marriage ahead

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:50.540
of yourself and continue to strengthen your bond of love.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:56.300
Every couple will have disagreements, so take the time now to prepare it together for

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.740
a peaceful resolution.
