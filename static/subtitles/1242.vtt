00:00:37.490 --> 00:01:09.400
I don't know why I get so nervous around people.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.719
I want to be more outgoing, but I'm just not that type of person.

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:20.290
Maybe I'm just too shy to be useful to Jehovah.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.769
What was that scripture Alison commented on last night?

00:01:23.769 --> 00:01:26.450
Philippians 317.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.049
Unitedly become imitators of me, brothers, and keep your eye on those who are walking

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.650
in a way that is in harmony with the example we set for you.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.129
Then she mentioned how scared she was to give talks, or even go door to door.

00:01:42.129 --> 00:01:45.290
But then she found a good friend in the congregation.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.730
By imitating her friend's seal, she eventually worked up the curse to start pioneering.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.290
Maybe if I reach out to Alison, she could be that friend for me.
