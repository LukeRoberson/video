00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:04.650
The world is in chaos.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.650
This system of things is disintegrating.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.650
The world economy, health systems, security, governments,

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.650
and we know where this all is leading.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.649
It is leading to the great tribulation.

00:00:19.649 --> 00:00:22.649
Have you ever asked yourself,

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:26.649
do I have enough faith?

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:31.649
To face these fear-inspiring events

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:34.649
with the joy of Jehovah.

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.310
Well, we can learn much from the example of Habakkuk.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.310
He lived in a similar time.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.310
Jehovah inspired him to give this prophecy

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:54.310
about 20 years before the destruction of Jerusalem in 607 BCE.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.170
Our daily text comments highlight three lessons

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.170
we can learn from the book of Habakkuk.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.170
It says there,

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.170
never stop praying,

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.170
listen to what Jehovah tells us through his word and organization

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.170
and patiently wait on Jehovah.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.170
So let us take those three points and discuss them briefly.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.989
The first one, never stop praying.

00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:35.989
Habakkuk in chapters one and two is engage the dialogue

00:01:35.989 --> 00:01:37.989
with Jehovah God.

00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:40.989
And if you look here,

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:42.989
in chapter one,

00:01:42.989 --> 00:01:44.989
verses one through four,

00:01:44.989 --> 00:01:48.989
he's asking Jehovah very intensely,

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:53.989
why do you allow violence,

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:58.989
doing oppression, injustice?

00:01:58.989 --> 00:02:00.989
It concerned him very much.

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:05.989
Then Jehovah answered Habakkuk from verse five through eleven.

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:09.990
And Jehovah says something very interesting in verse five.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.990
He says something will happen in your days

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.990
that you will not believe even if it is told to you,

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.990
for here I'm raising up the caldians, the Babylonians.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.990
So Jehovah was going to bring Babylon

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.990
to bring judgment and punishment on the evil doers.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.990
So Jehovah answered his prayer.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.990
We also are affected by injustice, are we not?

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.990
A brother here at Bethel recently told me

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.990
that he was watching a news program

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.990
and the reporter was explaining all the obvious

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.990
and terrible injustices that were happening.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.990
He said, it got me very tense.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.990
I had to shut the television off.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.990
But then he said, I talk to Jehovah.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.990
Afterwards, he said, I calmed right down

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.990
and my confidence returned.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.990
So prayer is very important.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.990
It puts us in the right frame of mind.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.990
But it doesn't end there.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.990
We need to go to the next step that of listening

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.990
to what Jehovah tells us through his word

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.990
and his organization.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.990
Now we can take the example from Habakkuk in chapter two.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.990
He helps us to see a procedure, a process,

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.990
or an approach that he took.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.990
First, in Habakkuk two verse one,

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.990
he says, at my God post, I will keep standing

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.990
and I will station myself on the rampart.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.990
Then he says, I will keep watch to see

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.990
what he will speak by means of me

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.990
and what I will reply when I'm approved.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.990
Do you see the two things he was doing?

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.990
He was keeping standing.

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.990
And the next thing, he was keeping watching.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.990
So keep standing in this particular case.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.990
He says, he will station himself on the rampart.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.990
Now a rampart, in those days, it could often have been

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.990
a wall around the city, a huge strong wall.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.990
So in other words, he was keeping himself

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.990
in a position of safety, first of all.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.990
And then secondly, he watched to see,

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.990
he listened to what Jehovah was telling him.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.990
Now as you know, listening has two components.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.990
The one part is hearing, getting the sense of it.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.990
And the second part is acting upon it.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.990
So here, Jehovah was speaking to Habakkuk and verse two.

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.990
He answered him and Jehovah said,

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.990
write down the vision and inscribe it clearly on tablets

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.990
so that the one reading aloud from it

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.990
might do so easily.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.990
Very interesting that Jehovah gives him an assignment

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.990
to write this down, but Jehovah also reveals

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.990
that he had in mind for someone to read it aloud,

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.560
to spread his message to others.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.560
So we can follow that example of Habakkuk.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.560
First of all, place ourselves under Jehovah's protection

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.560
on our rampart, as it were, under the mighty hand of God.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.560
Don't leave that safe place.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.560
And then secondly, listen, be ready to respond

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.560
to whatever Jehovah tells us to do.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.560
So how do we stay in our place?

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.560
Well, we stay focused on our assignment.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.560
We have work to do.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.560
We must preach and teach and do our part

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.560
in the Christian congregation.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.560
And we listen by being very carefully attuned

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.560
to God's organization, the leading we receive

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.560
from God's organization.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.560
We cannot anticipate what is going to happen next.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.560
Take, for instance, with this pandemic,

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.560
whoever has expected that.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.560
But look how beautifully Jehovah's people,

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.560
his organization, led us through these very difficult times.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.560
This now brings us to the third aspect,

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.560
patiently wait.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.560
The reality is, matters are going to get far worse

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.560
than they are now.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.560
And we shouldn't be surprised if our reaction is the same

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.560
as that of Habakkuk when he started anticipating

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.560
what was coming.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.560
Let us read you back at chapter 3, verse 16.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.560
He says, I heard and I trembled within.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.560
At the sound my lips quivered.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.560
My legs beneath me were shaking.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:18.579
But then he says, the second part of verse 16,

00:07:18.579 --> 00:07:23.579
but I quietly wait for the day of distress.

00:07:23.579 --> 00:07:26.579
That reaction is not lack of faith.

00:07:27.579 --> 00:07:31.579
But quietly wait as evidence of true faith.

00:07:31.579 --> 00:07:33.579
Now, Habakkuk was not naive.

00:07:33.579 --> 00:07:35.579
He knew what was coming.

00:07:35.579 --> 00:07:38.579
He described here in verse 17.

00:07:38.579 --> 00:07:40.579
The fig tree may not blossom.

00:07:40.579 --> 00:07:42.579
No fruit on the vines.

00:07:42.579 --> 00:07:44.579
The olive crop may fail.

00:07:44.579 --> 00:07:47.579
The fields may produce no food.

00:07:47.579 --> 00:07:50.579
So food may run short.

00:07:50.579 --> 00:07:53.579
Property may be lost.

00:07:53.579 --> 00:07:56.579
Standards of living may go down.

00:07:56.579 --> 00:08:00.579
But the question is, how will we respond?

00:08:00.579 --> 00:08:02.579
What will be our reaction?

00:08:02.579 --> 00:08:04.579
Will we quietly wait?

00:08:04.579 --> 00:08:07.579
And patiently, calmly?

00:08:07.579 --> 00:08:11.579
Except whatever happens, even if the sequence of events

00:08:11.579 --> 00:08:15.579
are not exactly what we expect him to be.

00:08:15.579 --> 00:08:17.579
So what's the lesson?

00:08:17.579 --> 00:08:20.579
The lesson is Habakkuk 2, verse 3.

00:08:21.579 --> 00:08:25.579
Jehovah has an appointed time.

00:08:25.579 --> 00:08:28.579
He says the vision is for the appointed time.

00:08:28.579 --> 00:08:31.579
Keep in expectation of it.

00:08:31.579 --> 00:08:35.580
It will not be late.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:40.580
So what matters is not when the end will come,

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:45.580
how the end will come, but that we live a life

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:49.580
of faith doing Jehovah's will.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.580
So back to the question, do I have enough faith

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.580
to go through the upcoming fear-inspiring events

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.580
and keep my joy?

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.580
Absolutely.

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.580
Habakkuk 3, verse 18, he ends the chapter, he says,

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:07.580
but as for me, I will exalt in Jehovah,

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:12.580
I will be joyful in the God of my salvation.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.580
So what's the bottom line?

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:18.580
Pray, listen and wait patiently.
