00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:15.980
We always enjoy this part at our Gilead graduations, the student experiences that they've had

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:23.120
from the field activity while they were at school, Kenneth Olson, a instructor with the

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:29.100
ocratic schools department, will handle this part, and they have the theme, the scene

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:40.979
of this world is changing.

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:49.579
The Apostle Paul once wrote to the congregation in Corinth, the scene of this world is changing.

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:55.119
And in doing so, he likened the world to a stage with actors playing their various roles

00:00:55.119 --> 00:01:01.859
until a change of scenes, so surrounded by the potential distractions of the world there

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.019
in the first century, our brothers needed to give priority to spiritual matters.

00:01:08.019 --> 00:01:13.379
Through worship had to come first, and in an important way they showed that they kept

00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:20.980
their spiritual focus was through their obedience to Jesus' command, to preach and teach,

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.260
and they did this in various ways.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:30.859
Notice the example of the Apostle Paul at Acts chapter 17, verse 17.

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:38.620
Here in Acts chapter 17, verse 17, it says, so he began to reason in the synagogue with

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:45.700
the Jews and the other people who worshipped God, and every day in the marketplace with

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.060
those who happened to be on hand.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.859
So we noticed that Paul in the marketplace was ready to talk to whoever happened to be

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:56.859
on hand.

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:00.260
He didn't know who they would be, but he was ready.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.099
So the principles that apply then apply now, because many of the concerns that people

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:08.060
had back then, people have now.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.340
And so our work is like it was in the first century.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:20.020
Now as brother and sister Cook were traveling to Gilead School, they like Paul were ready,

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.580
they were alert to speak with those who happened to be on hand.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.939
This time it was not in the marketplace, it was at a train station.

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:38.099
And notice how they were ready to discuss various topics as we watch this video reenactment.

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.259
Thank you so much, Manny, for helping us with the bags, we really appreciate that.

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:45.020
Well, you have certainly held a lot of bags, where are you going?

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.659
We are going to Paterson, New York, to attend a Bible school for the next six months.

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:50.659
Really?

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:51.659
A six month Bible school?

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.180
Well, that is amazing.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.300
Yeah, with your Hover's Witnesses, Manny, I'm sure you've heard about us, there's our

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.300
little card.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.780
Yeah, I have seen you have a Witnesses going from door to door, you know, even you go out

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.139
with, whether it's really cold, I have a lot of respect for you people.

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:08.139
Oh, thank you.

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:11.979
Well, we love sharing the Bible message with people.

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:16.259
Here, Manny, on the back of this track, there's a QR code, and it takes you to our website,

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:17.259
JW.org.

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:22.259
So on there, there's publications you can download and read, but also there's a section

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:25.219
that answers questions you might have about the Bible.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:26.620
That's good.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.860
I have some questions.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:35.340
In fact, my mother died last year, so she's suffered for such a long time.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.340
Yeah.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.340
So sorry to hear that.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.259
We are very sorry, losing someone dear must be so difficult.

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:47.300
Yeah, well, it kind of affected my faith, you know, she was a wonderful person.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.060
Why do you have to suffer like that?

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.099
I can understand you feeling that way, Manny.

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:58.060
When you've lived a life like your mom, and she's been such a good person, and then she

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.060
suffers like that.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.580
I mean, it's difficult to bear, isn't it?

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:02.979
It's difficult to bear.

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:06.819
This track, it's asking the question, will suffering ever end?

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.780
Do you think that's the sort of question you're really asking?

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:10.780
Yes, it is.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:11.780
Well, thank you.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.300
Thank you very much.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.180
You know, I can stay with you until your little friend comes for you.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.180
Oh, thank you.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.180
Oh, thank you.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.180
Thank you very much.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.779
I've been thinking about all of these.

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:23.980
You know, the whole world is a mess.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.980
We agree with you, but why is it a mess?

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.579
I can show you another track.

00:04:29.579 --> 00:04:31.500
It does have an interesting question.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.699
It says, who really controls the world?

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:37.420
And you'll be surprised to know the answer.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.220
Notice what the Bible says.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.420
The evil one controls the whole world.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.019
So did you notice who is in control?

00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:48.579
What does the Bible says?

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.860
The devil means the devil?

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:51.699
That's right.

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.500
Well, then explain why the world is in such a part conditions.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.100
And you know, money, the Bible says that God has set up a kingdom

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.259
that is going to overrule the devil.

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:06.300
And also, he's going to bring the suffering to an end.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.060
May I have that background for you?

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.019
Of course, yeah, this is for you.

00:05:09.019 --> 00:05:12.180
I just wanted to point, on the back again in this track,

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.300
is our website that Richard just mentioned?

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.019
If you would like, you can go there and you can ask for somebody

00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:19.579
to come and visit you.

00:05:19.579 --> 00:05:21.899
And you can discuss all the questions you have.

00:05:21.899 --> 00:05:24.180
And they will answer you from the Bible.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.899
Oh, well, thank you very much.

00:05:25.899 --> 00:05:27.459
You are welcome.

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:28.699
Oh, this is our drive.

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:29.500
Yes.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.300
Pleased to meet you.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.300
Nice to meet you.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.139
Thank you for coming.

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:33.139
Thank you.

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:34.139
Thank you.

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:35.500
Well, it was a pleasure meeting you.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.459
Thank you, Manny.

00:05:36.459 --> 00:05:38.100
We really appreciate all your help.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.899
Thank you for your help.

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:39.579
Bye-bye.

00:05:39.579 --> 00:05:40.740
Goodbye.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:50.689
So did you see how brother and sister cook were prepared?

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.129
They had literature ready.

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:55.129
They didn't know who it would be or what the topic would be,

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:56.850
but they were ready.

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.970
Another way that our first century brothers and sisters

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.970
obeyed Jesus' command is found at Acts 5, verse 42.

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:10.129
And Acts 5, verse 42, it says there,

00:06:13.209 --> 00:06:17.009
and every day in the temple and from house to house,

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:19.490
they continued without let up,

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:24.529
teaching and declaring the good news about the Christ Jesus.

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:27.250
So it says they went from house to house.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.730
Now, this was shortly after Pentecost of 33 CE.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.170
And already the young congregation is active

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.329
in the door-to-door ministry,

00:06:36.329 --> 00:06:38.490
talking to people face to face.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.850
And this work is still at the centers,

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:44.569
at the forefront of our worldwide preaching effort.

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.209
So contacting people directly helps us

00:06:47.209 --> 00:06:50.089
to help them individually.

00:06:50.089 --> 00:06:53.569
Now, in the first century, Jesus helped people face to face

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:56.009
very often with the resurrection hope.

00:06:56.009 --> 00:06:58.170
He built them up, gave them hope.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.089
Now, we do the same.

00:07:00.089 --> 00:07:01.810
Now, we're very often when we talk to people

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:03.290
from house to house.

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.290
We're there, we have a scripture, we're prepared,

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:07.529
we have a topic we want to talk about.

00:07:07.529 --> 00:07:09.569
And all of a sudden, the householder

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:12.529
will talk about what's on their mind and heart.

00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:15.370
Essentially, they changed the subject.

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.250
So what do we do?

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:20.410
Well, an alert teacher will follow the concern

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:24.009
of the householder and address that concern.

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:26.250
So watch how Brother Manzulu

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.769
followed the householder's concern

00:07:28.769 --> 00:07:31.370
and comforted him with the resurrection hope

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:33.170
when he was invited into a man's home

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:36.649
for the very first time and see how he changed the subject

00:07:36.649 --> 00:07:40.939
and Brother Manzulu followed it.

00:07:40.939 --> 00:07:43.420
Thank you for inviting us in.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:44.459
You're welcome.

00:07:44.459 --> 00:07:48.259
How will you describe the situation in the world today?

00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:53.259
I lost my wife a few years ago and life is not easy.

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.620
We are so sorry to hear that you lost your wife.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.860
That must be difficult to deal with.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:04.339
It is difficult, but I know you're going to say

00:08:04.339 --> 00:08:08.620
that there's the hope of the resurrection

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.420
and that with a little bit of money,

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.019
I'll be able to see my wife again,

00:08:12.019 --> 00:08:14.899
but I don't know if I believe that.

00:08:15.939 --> 00:08:18.740
Did someone say to you that you need to pay something

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.180
like money to see your wife again?

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:23.420
Yes, that's what the church said.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.980
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.860
But really, do you believe that God needs our money?

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:31.660
Of course not.

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:35.259
But I don't believe that the resurrection is true.

00:08:35.259 --> 00:08:37.700
What is your point of view?

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.539
Where do we come from?

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:44.539
I guess, of course, there had to be some person that made us.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:49.100
Life just couldn't have came about by itself.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.980
So I would say that person is God.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:53.940
So let me give you an example.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:58.740
Suppose that you own a company that makes a cause.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.860
Let's say you make Mercedes fans

00:09:02.899 --> 00:09:06.419
and you decide to give a new one to your friends.

00:09:06.419 --> 00:09:07.860
It's very happy.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.059
But the very first day in drive that car, he has a crush.

00:09:12.059 --> 00:09:15.179
Then he called you, he said, instead,

00:09:15.179 --> 00:09:17.460
you know, I just had a crush.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.539
What will you say?

00:09:19.899 --> 00:09:22.100
Just bring it back, I'll fix it.

00:09:23.379 --> 00:09:26.419
But what if he said to you, friends,

00:09:26.419 --> 00:09:28.259
I'm not sure he will fix it.

00:09:28.259 --> 00:09:30.700
It's totally broken.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.700
What will you say to him?

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.500
If I made it, I can fix it.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.500
I can even make a new one.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:41.299
You know, when something does not work properly in our body,

00:09:41.299 --> 00:09:46.299
or let's say when our body stops working, we call it death.

00:09:46.779 --> 00:09:50.980
But actually, from the point of view of the one who created life,

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.779
we can say this is just like a crush.

00:09:53.779 --> 00:09:55.220
Would you agree with that?

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.940
Yeah, I would agree with that.

00:09:57.899 --> 00:10:00.700
And when this happened, usually we are very sad

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:05.220
because that person that died may be someone who really loved.

00:10:06.059 --> 00:10:11.539
But could the one who created life be able to fix the problem

00:10:11.539 --> 00:10:14.379
or recreate that person?

00:10:14.379 --> 00:10:16.620
Yeah, he should be able to do that.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.740
But you know, we three years,

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.899
we've never seen someone rest from the dead.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.940
So talking about the resurrection,

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.779
must be something strange to us.

00:10:29.779 --> 00:10:32.019
And God understand that.

00:10:32.019 --> 00:10:36.220
But you know what Jesus said in the past when he was here on Earth.

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.259
He says something very interesting.

00:10:38.259 --> 00:10:39.940
And I would like to share it with you.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:46.940
It's in, it's found in the book of John chapter 5 verse 28 and 29.

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:50.059
And while Shula might be reading that scripture,

00:10:50.059 --> 00:10:54.220
please try to imagine that God is speaking to you personally.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.659
Please Shula, can you read it?

00:10:56.659 --> 00:10:59.379
John 5, 20, 18, 29.

00:10:59.379 --> 00:11:02.059
Do not be amazed at this.

00:11:02.059 --> 00:11:06.419
For the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs

00:11:06.419 --> 00:11:08.899
will hear his voice and come out.

00:11:08.899 --> 00:11:12.500
Those who did good things to a resurrection of life

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:17.220
and those who put its vice things to a resurrection of judgment.

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:20.539
God knows that may look impossible to you,

00:11:20.539 --> 00:11:24.500
but he shows us that this will take place.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.340
It's clear now.

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.659
You know, there are many other good promises

00:11:28.659 --> 00:11:31.379
in the Bible from God for human kinds.

00:11:31.379 --> 00:11:34.139
And if you want, we can help you to know them.

00:11:34.139 --> 00:11:46.580
Yeah, I would like that.

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:50.419
Did you see how brother in Banzulu was willing to drop the topic

00:11:50.419 --> 00:11:54.539
he wanted to talk about and follow the concern of the man instead?

00:11:54.539 --> 00:11:56.940
Very loving and very alert.

00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:00.019
Now in the first century, there were many different ideas

00:12:00.019 --> 00:12:02.220
and philosophies of life.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:05.100
Pontius Pilate expressed one when he said to Jesus,

00:12:05.139 --> 00:12:06.899
what is truth?

00:12:06.899 --> 00:12:08.940
And he said that rather scornfully,

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:13.580
but today, some feel unsure if it's possible to know truth.

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:17.139
Well, our first century brothers would often find common ground

00:12:17.139 --> 00:12:21.019
with someone to reason with them and help them see the point.

00:12:21.019 --> 00:12:23.220
And we do the same today.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:26.980
Watch how sister Martinez found common ground

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.779
to reason with a man who seemed unsure

00:12:29.779 --> 00:12:36.470
if it were possible to know truth.

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:37.269
Good morning, sir.

00:12:37.269 --> 00:12:38.110
Good morning.

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:40.950
I'd like to find you here and we're asking people

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:43.870
in the area of question and I'd like your opinion.

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:45.230
Okay, sure.

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:47.710
Do you think that it's actually possible for us

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:51.509
to get to know what the truth is living in a world

00:12:51.509 --> 00:12:53.710
where more have truths exist?

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:54.710
No, I don't think so.

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:56.389
Nobody has the truth.

00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:57.830
I'm sure you have your own religion

00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:00.950
and in fact, your own translation of the Bible.

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:04.509
And everyone's entitled to believe what they want to believe.

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:09.710
Yeah, we all have the right to believe in what we want to believe in.

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:14.470
But do you think that God wants us to get to know what the truth is?

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:16.029
Yeah, sure.

00:13:16.029 --> 00:13:17.990
You know, I noticed that you have an accent.

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:20.029
If you don't mind me asking, where are you from?

00:13:20.029 --> 00:13:20.629
Oh, I don't mind.

00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:22.070
I'm from Ecuador.

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:22.909
Oh, wow.

00:13:22.909 --> 00:13:25.269
You know, I've been living in South America

00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:26.950
for the past few years with my husband.

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:27.710
Oh, really?

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:28.549
What country?

00:13:28.549 --> 00:13:29.470
In Paraguay.

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:30.149
Oh, yeah.

00:13:30.149 --> 00:13:31.470
Okay, I know Paraguay nice.

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:34.590
Yeah, you know, they speak Spanish there also

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:37.509
and they have a little bit of an accent.

00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:42.190
They also use certain expressions that are unfamiliar for me.

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:44.669
But generally, I could understand what they're saying.

00:13:44.669 --> 00:13:47.190
True, it is slightly different.

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:50.549
This reminds me of when we study the Bible.

00:13:50.549 --> 00:13:53.830
For example, the translation that we use,

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:55.750
they're in many languages.

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:58.429
The Bible that we have in Spanish

00:13:58.429 --> 00:14:01.669
wasn't originally in Spanish, it's a translation.

00:14:01.669 --> 00:14:06.909
And although one Bible may differ slightly from one another,

00:14:06.909 --> 00:14:09.190
even within the same language,

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:11.950
they generally convey the same idea.

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:14.070
Yeah, that makes sense, sure.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.070
Now, do you think that God is aware

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:18.710
of these apparent difficulties that exist?

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:20.669
Hmm, good question.

00:14:20.669 --> 00:14:22.350
Yeah, I think so.

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:24.149
Yeah, He definitely has to know.

00:14:24.149 --> 00:14:27.110
And you know, he actually encourages us

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:30.950
through the Bible to get to know what these truths are.

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:34.230
These truths are revealed clearly here.

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:38.070
And this Bible text at 1 Timothy,

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:40.230
2, 3 and 4 that I'd like to read to you.

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:43.549
It says, this is fine and acceptable

00:14:43.549 --> 00:14:46.509
in the sight of our Savior, God,

00:14:46.509 --> 00:14:51.029
whose will is that all sorts of people should be saved

00:14:51.029 --> 00:14:56.269
and notice this part, come to an accurate knowledge of truth.

00:14:56.269 --> 00:14:57.269
Okay.

00:14:57.269 --> 00:14:58.269
Not have truths.

00:14:58.269 --> 00:14:59.269
Right.

00:14:59.269 --> 00:15:04.750
So God is really concerned about us coming to an accurate knowledge of truth.

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:07.590
Now, do you think that this is possible

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:13.029
if we dedicate research in the Bible on a superficial level?

00:15:13.029 --> 00:15:14.029
No, I don't think so.

00:15:14.029 --> 00:15:16.389
You can't come to accurate knowledge like that.

00:15:16.389 --> 00:15:17.389
It's impossible.

00:15:17.389 --> 00:15:19.669
Yeah, I think the same way.

00:15:19.669 --> 00:15:22.789
It really means that we have to investigate

00:15:22.789 --> 00:15:26.990
in what God's trying to tell us in such a large book.

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:29.629
You know, I have this book with me

00:15:29.629 --> 00:15:32.269
that has this very interesting theme.

00:15:32.269 --> 00:15:34.389
What does the Bible really teach?

00:15:34.389 --> 00:15:38.750
And it reveals what those Bible truths are.

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:41.110
I would like to get this available to you.

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:42.789
I only have it in English.

00:15:42.789 --> 00:15:43.789
Okay.

00:15:43.789 --> 00:15:44.750
How can I do this?

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:46.269
Well, I have to leave now.

00:15:46.269 --> 00:15:47.309
I have to go to work.

00:15:47.309 --> 00:15:49.350
But I'll give you my contact information

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:51.750
and then we can make arrangements.

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:52.750
Oh, that sounds great.

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:53.750
Yeah.

00:15:53.750 --> 00:16:05.600
Okay.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:09.080
No doubt you saw how Sister Martinez was able to use things

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:14.120
that they had in common to help the man reason about the point.

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.840
Now, we've seen so far as students preaching

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:21.039
in a train station, people's homes, a parking lot.

00:16:21.039 --> 00:16:23.279
Well, really Jesus set the example

00:16:23.279 --> 00:16:26.399
about reaching people wherever they may be.

00:16:26.399 --> 00:16:30.519
Notice in Matthew, chapter 9, verse 9.

00:16:30.519 --> 00:16:34.639
They're in Matthew 9, verse 9.

00:16:34.639 --> 00:16:39.440
It says there, next, while moving on from there,

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.279
Jesus caught sight of a man named Matthew,

00:16:42.279 --> 00:16:44.200
sitting at the tax office.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.320
And he said to him, be my follower.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.240
At that, he rose up and followed him.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.360
So Matthew was sitting at the tax office.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.200
He was in his place of employment.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.919
So Jesus preached in business territory.

00:16:59.919 --> 00:17:01.639
Well, that we do the same thing today.

00:17:01.639 --> 00:17:03.159
We preach in business territory.

00:17:03.159 --> 00:17:05.240
We try to reach people where they are.

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:09.240
Now, back in the first century, we know the main theme was

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.240
the kingdom.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.319
This is the theme of the preaching work.

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:14.160
This is still the case today.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.880
This is the theme of the preaching work.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:19.880
In our last reenactment, it takes place in a beauty salon.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:23.160
Our sister's coming back to the woman's place of business

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.400
in order to cultivate the interest shown

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.240
in the very first conversation.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:33.150
And notice how she directs attention to the kingdom.

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:34.150
Hi, Diane.

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:35.109
Hi.

00:17:35.109 --> 00:17:36.829
It's so nice to see you again.

00:17:36.829 --> 00:17:38.710
Today, I bought a video to show you.

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:43.779
It's called, does God have a name?

00:17:43.779 --> 00:17:47.980
Does God have a name at a time and place

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:54.410
convenient for you?

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:57.089
So as you saw in the video, we all have names

00:17:57.089 --> 00:17:58.569
to identify ourselves.

00:17:58.569 --> 00:18:00.970
Your name is Diane, and my name is Claire.

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:03.490
So wouldn't it make sense for God to have a name

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:05.529
to identify himself with?

00:18:05.569 --> 00:18:07.569
Sure, that makes perfect sense.

00:18:07.569 --> 00:18:10.009
And did you know that the name Jehovah's in the Bible

00:18:10.009 --> 00:18:12.329
about 7,000 times?

00:18:12.329 --> 00:18:16.049
Wow, if it's in there that much, it must be important.

00:18:16.049 --> 00:18:18.890
You know, Claire, I do read the Bible every day.

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:21.769
And I've been trying to get closer to God.

00:18:21.769 --> 00:18:23.450
But it's not easy.

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:27.329
I'm so busy running the business and looking after my children.

00:18:27.329 --> 00:18:28.490
And that's another thing.

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:30.609
I'm constantly worried about my children.

00:18:30.609 --> 00:18:32.450
The world is just getting so bad.

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:34.410
I wonder about their future.

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:36.369
Yeah, I can imagine that it's not easy,

00:18:36.369 --> 00:18:38.849
but it's good that you're looking to the Bible.

00:18:38.849 --> 00:18:41.089
In fact, today I wanted to show you a verse

00:18:41.089 --> 00:18:44.410
from Daniel chapter 2 and verse 44.

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:47.089
It says, in the days of those kings,

00:18:47.089 --> 00:18:49.130
the God of heaven will set up a kingdom

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:51.170
that will never be destroyed.

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:54.970
And this kingdom will not be passed on to any other people.

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:58.210
It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:00.849
and it alone will stand forever.

00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:03.490
Perhaps you've heard of people pray that our Father

00:19:03.529 --> 00:19:05.809
and they're asking for God's kingdom to come.

00:19:05.809 --> 00:19:09.890
They want to see God's will done on the earth as it was in heaven.

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:12.250
And really, that's what this kingdom is talking about.

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:15.569
It's God's government to bring an end to suffering in the world.

00:19:15.569 --> 00:19:18.210
I would really like to see that change.

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:21.210
Yeah, we all want to see an end to suffering.

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:22.289
But what do you think?

00:19:22.289 --> 00:19:24.329
Do you think God really has the power

00:19:24.329 --> 00:19:26.369
to bring about these changes?

00:19:26.369 --> 00:19:29.250
Of course, I think he has all the power.

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:31.529
Yeah, that's right. He does.

00:19:31.529 --> 00:19:35.730
And he also wants to see an end to this suffering.

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:37.769
In fact, that's why it's so important for us

00:19:37.769 --> 00:19:39.769
to try and learn as much as we can

00:19:39.769 --> 00:19:42.210
about his purpose for the earth.

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:44.009
I would like to learn more about God

00:19:44.009 --> 00:19:46.529
and what he's going to do for the future.

00:19:46.529 --> 00:19:47.650
Yeah, that's so good.

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:50.250
I really enjoy speaking to you about this.

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:53.529
I was thinking, do you usually work here on Saturday mornings?

00:19:53.529 --> 00:19:54.369
I do.

00:19:54.369 --> 00:19:56.130
I work here just about every Saturday.

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:59.329
So if you come, we can sit down for a few minutes and talk.

00:19:59.329 --> 00:20:00.769
Oh, I would really appreciate it

00:20:00.769 --> 00:20:02.609
if we can have a little bit of time together

00:20:02.609 --> 00:20:04.329
to talk about that subject.

00:20:04.329 --> 00:20:04.849
Sure.

00:20:04.849 --> 00:20:05.690
Thank you so much.

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:06.849
It was nice to see you today.

00:20:06.849 --> 00:20:07.650
You too.

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:08.170
Bye-bye.

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:14.029
Bye-bye.

00:20:14.029 --> 00:20:19.309
Our Gilead students have been doing a very good job

00:20:19.309 --> 00:20:23.109
directing people to the kingdom as the only true hope

00:20:23.109 --> 00:20:24.869
for a mankind.

00:20:24.869 --> 00:20:28.789
Now, in the first century, our brothers and sisters

00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:32.390
faced many of the challenges that are common today.

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:34.589
How should they view higher education?

00:20:34.589 --> 00:20:37.710
How to keep focused on spiritual goals?

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:41.349
How to avoid the dangers of bad association?

00:20:41.349 --> 00:20:42.950
Well, our Gilead students have faced

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:45.829
these very issues successfully.

00:20:45.829 --> 00:20:48.230
And the decisions that they've made in the past

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:50.789
have helped them be here today.

00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:53.670
Now, notice how our students met the various challenges posed

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:56.390
by what to do with higher education.

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:58.789
Potential distractions from their spiritual goals

00:20:58.789 --> 00:21:01.109
and avoiding bad associations.

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:03.190
Would you like to meet some of our Gilead students

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:24.539
and get to know them just a little bit better?

00:21:24.539 --> 00:21:28.299
Well, we have with us, brother and sister in Banzulu,

00:21:28.299 --> 00:21:32.019
fallen Shulamai in Banzulu from Congo, Kinshasa.

00:21:32.019 --> 00:21:37.180
We have brother Ella Faz and Nancy Rosenzweig from Israel

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:41.140
and sister Turkiana Gashi from Serbia.

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:43.460
And we're glad to have all of you with us.

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:46.099
Brother in Banzulu, let's start with you.

00:21:46.099 --> 00:21:48.980
What spiritual goal did you set for yourself

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:51.220
as you were growing up?

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:54.140
I wanted to be a special pioneer.

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.299
Well, that's an excellent spiritual goal for a young man.

00:21:57.299 --> 00:22:00.940
Now, once you set that goal, however,

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:03.380
potential obstacle arose.

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:07.579
Yes, this happened when I was 14 years old.

00:22:07.579 --> 00:22:10.740
My father said to me that he would support me financially

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:15.579
and even pay for my education if I would like to be a lawyer

00:22:15.579 --> 00:22:17.740
or a physician.

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:21.980
So he offered you free higher education,

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:24.700
but you had this other spiritual goal in mind.

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.299
What did you do?

00:22:26.299 --> 00:22:28.619
I kindly explained to him that I had the goal

00:22:28.619 --> 00:22:32.819
to be a special pioneer, so I declined his offer.

00:22:32.819 --> 00:22:35.220
Well, that sounds like a good thing.

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:38.339
You kept your focus on spiritual matters.

00:22:38.339 --> 00:22:41.140
What did your father think about that?

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:45.779
He was very disappointed because he didn't expect that answer.

00:22:45.779 --> 00:22:49.539
He said to me, if I did not take his offer,

00:22:49.539 --> 00:22:51.900
I would have to support myself.

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:55.059
And if in the future I have to face some difficulties,

00:22:55.059 --> 00:22:57.059
I should not go back to him.

00:22:57.059 --> 00:23:01.180
And he even mentioned that I was no longer his son.

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:04.339
And that hurt me deeply.

00:23:04.339 --> 00:23:06.220
But I'm happy that I made that decision

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:09.180
because otherwise, I will not have benefited

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:11.980
from the highest education, the divine education

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:13.900
that I've enjoyed in Gilead.

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:16.299
Well, we know that it was not an easy situation

00:23:16.299 --> 00:23:19.140
to face as a young man who had a lot of faith

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:21.900
and spiritual focus and we're glad that you did that.

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.500
So you went ahead with your goal of a special pioneer.

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.380
So when did you become a special pioneer?

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:27.339
I never did.

00:23:27.339 --> 00:23:30.259
What happened?

00:23:30.259 --> 00:23:32.460
I was invited to serve in Bethel

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:33.980
and I accepted that invitation.

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:36.259
Well, we know that Jehovah's bless you there, too.

00:23:36.259 --> 00:23:38.940
Yeah, I receive many blessings in Bethel.

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:44.019
And one of them actually is my marriage with Shulamite.

00:23:44.019 --> 00:23:47.220
It's really a gift coming from Jehovah

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:49.700
and that Shulamite loves to Jehovah

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:51.420
and support me in my service.

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:56.259
Yes, well, Sister Manzulu, now your father was Muslim.

00:23:56.259 --> 00:23:56.980
Yes.

00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:58.619
And what did he think about the family

00:23:58.619 --> 00:24:00.019
being Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:24:00.019 --> 00:24:02.539
My father never reposed it off.

00:24:02.539 --> 00:24:05.140
He saw that it was good and even encourages.

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:08.259
All right, so that allowed you to set spiritual goals.

00:24:08.259 --> 00:24:10.420
What spiritual goal did you set for yourself?

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:12.180
I wanted to be a special pioneer.

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:15.779
That's an excellent spiritual goal.

00:24:15.779 --> 00:24:18.180
And what did your family think about that goal?

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:20.700
My immediate family was supportive.

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:22.500
But other in the family,

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:26.380
pressured me to pursue a education and travel to Europe.

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:29.940
That could help me in the temptation, but it was a trap.

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:33.940
Spiritual education is far more viable.

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:36.099
I'm glad I made a good decision.

00:24:36.099 --> 00:24:37.059
You're welcome.

00:24:37.059 --> 00:24:38.380
Well, so we're glad to.

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:41.259
So both of you really had to say spiritually focused there.

00:24:41.259 --> 00:24:44.420
So you went ahead with your goal of being a special pioneer.

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:46.180
When did you become a special pioneer?

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:49.779
I didn't become a special pioneer.

00:24:49.779 --> 00:24:52.940
I was invited to serve a better for two weeks.

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:56.859
And then I was invited to stay in better service.

00:24:56.859 --> 00:24:57.539
Well, that's good.

00:24:57.539 --> 00:24:59.579
You both remained focused on spiritual goals,

00:24:59.579 --> 00:25:02.019
but flexible to Jehovah's direction.

00:25:02.019 --> 00:25:04.339
And we're glad that you did.

00:25:04.339 --> 00:25:06.660
Brother Rosen's bike.

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:09.420
Now, you come from a very spiritually active family.

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:12.099
What did your parents do to raise you

00:25:12.099 --> 00:25:15.259
in such a fine spiritual environment?

00:25:15.259 --> 00:25:15.779
It's true.

00:25:15.779 --> 00:25:21.180
Today, when I'm looking back, I see that my parents did so much.

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:23.259
In addition to our family study,

00:25:23.259 --> 00:25:27.420
my parents study with all five of us separately.

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:30.140
They went with us to service.

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:32.619
We read together the daily text.

00:25:32.619 --> 00:25:38.900
And also, my father, he prayed with each one of us every night.

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:43.779
So what influence did that all have on your spiritual routine?

00:25:43.779 --> 00:25:46.819
So I still pray every night with my wife.

00:25:46.819 --> 00:25:49.700
And recently, I asked my brother and sisters

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.819
if they have the same habit till today.

00:25:52.819 --> 00:25:54.660
And all of them say yes.

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:58.859
So all of us pray every night like we did with our father.

00:25:58.859 --> 00:26:00.099
Excellent.

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:02.900
Well, I know that you met a spiritually-minded sister

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:04.019
in your congregation.

00:26:04.019 --> 00:26:05.339
You got married.

00:26:05.339 --> 00:26:07.539
And then what did you do to make yourself

00:26:07.539 --> 00:26:10.579
more available to pursue spiritual goals?

00:26:10.579 --> 00:26:13.740
So we began to simplify our life.

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:16.819
We avoid financial obligation.

00:26:16.819 --> 00:26:19.460
And we expand our ministry.

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:22.500
After a while, we were invited to Bethel.

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:24.220
Well, it's excellent, wonderful invitation.

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:25.940
I'm sure you were very excited.

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:28.140
Now, when that happened, though,

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:30.779
a potential distraction arose.

00:26:30.779 --> 00:26:33.900
Yeah, my employer really wants me to stay.

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:38.779
So he offered me a big raise, stocking the company, a car.

00:26:38.779 --> 00:26:42.940
But the real riches are found in the full-time service.

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:45.859
And look, here we are, getting the divine education

00:26:45.859 --> 00:26:47.180
that you have a provide.

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:48.220
Yeah, very true.

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:51.539
And now, Sister Rosenzweig, so when your husband

00:26:51.539 --> 00:26:55.380
received the invitation to Bethel, obviously, it's to you, too.

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:58.259
And you also had some potential distractions

00:26:58.259 --> 00:27:00.099
come at the same time.

00:27:00.099 --> 00:27:00.980
True.

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:03.460
The same week we were invited to Bethel.

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:05.180
I got a phone call for a company that

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:07.220
offered me a well-paid job.

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:10.339
And just before that, I have said no to a full scholarship

00:27:10.339 --> 00:27:12.299
to pursue more education.

00:27:12.299 --> 00:27:15.180
And both of us got so many offer during that time.

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:18.180
It was very clear somebody is not happy about our decision.

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:20.019
Yes.

00:27:20.019 --> 00:27:23.539
Now, your first name, Sister Rosenzweig,

00:27:23.539 --> 00:27:25.940
doesn't sound very Israeli.

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:29.980
How did you come to be called Nancy?

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:32.500
So my father is from an Arabic background,

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.859
and my mom from a Jewish background.

00:27:34.859 --> 00:27:37.660
As you know, in Israel, it's not so common for a Jew

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:38.779
to marry in Arab.

00:27:38.779 --> 00:27:41.740
But this is what's so beautiful about our organization.

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:43.579
And the brothers and sisters in Israel

00:27:43.579 --> 00:27:46.220
really give a good witness in this regard.

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:48.140
But still, my parent decided to make

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:51.420
both sides of the family happy and gave me an American name.

00:27:51.819 --> 00:27:54.859
Very diplomatic of them.

00:27:54.859 --> 00:27:56.660
And how did your parents help you

00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:59.140
to have a spiritual environment in which

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:02.059
you could set good spiritual goals?

00:28:02.059 --> 00:28:05.099
Both of my parents are really good student of the Bible.

00:28:05.099 --> 00:28:07.460
And I would always see them prepare for the meeting.

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:10.339
We would never miss a meeting without a good reason.

00:28:10.339 --> 00:28:12.579
Additionally, my mom, before she got married,

00:28:12.579 --> 00:28:15.619
she was a special pioneer in both her and my dad.

00:28:15.619 --> 00:28:17.579
They love talking about Jehovah and going out

00:28:17.579 --> 00:28:19.019
in the ministry.

00:28:19.019 --> 00:28:21.859
I know that your mother also made considerable effort

00:28:21.859 --> 00:28:24.420
to cultivate your love for the ministry.

00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:25.180
Yes.

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:27.460
There is one experience, and you really remember.

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:28.660
I was very young.

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:30.900
She took me to preach an unassigned territory

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:34.819
in a city near Mount Harmon, and we preach for some hours.

00:28:34.819 --> 00:28:37.579
And after that, she took me to eat my favorite food,

00:28:37.579 --> 00:28:39.579
humus and french fries.

00:28:39.579 --> 00:28:40.579
Ah.

00:28:40.579 --> 00:28:44.460
And how has their example influenced you until today?

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:47.059
And till today, I have good study habits.

00:28:47.059 --> 00:28:49.619
I have deep appreciation for our meetings.

00:28:49.619 --> 00:28:51.500
And I love talking about Jehovah.

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:55.460
And I still like humus and french fries.

00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:57.339
Now, when you were in school, you

00:28:57.339 --> 00:28:59.259
were different from all of the other children.

00:28:59.259 --> 00:29:01.980
All of the other children were Jewish.

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:03.740
And we know that as a young person,

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:06.579
it can be especially difficult to be different from everyone

00:29:06.579 --> 00:29:07.299
else.

00:29:07.299 --> 00:29:09.539
How did you handle that?

00:29:09.539 --> 00:29:10.980
For a while, I found it difficult

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:13.259
to speak about my religious and school.

00:29:13.259 --> 00:29:15.859
But I not thought to myself, I need to be proud that I'm

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:17.500
one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.380
So I just decided to speak with one of my classmates.

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:23.059
And when I told her, she said, oh, now I understand why

00:29:23.059 --> 00:29:24.339
you are so different.

00:29:24.339 --> 00:29:26.500
And the conversation went so well.

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:27.740
I felt relieved.

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:30.779
And things were much easier at school after that.

00:29:30.779 --> 00:29:33.539
So what advice would you have for young people

00:29:33.539 --> 00:29:35.940
who are in school today?

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:38.619
I would say, just be proud that you are one of Jehovah's

00:29:38.619 --> 00:29:39.220
Witnesses.

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:41.660
We're serving the best God and tell you

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:44.900
a classmate about it as soon as possible that will make you

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:46.660
happy and more important.

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:48.180
It will make Jehovah happy.

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:49.859
And he will bless your efforts.

00:29:49.859 --> 00:29:50.940
Yes.

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:52.579
Sister Gashi.

00:29:52.579 --> 00:29:55.500
Sister Gashi, you serve in Serbia.

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:57.140
You live there.

00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:00.849
But you didn't grow up there.

00:30:00.849 --> 00:30:03.849
I grew up in the Roma culture with the master background.

00:30:03.849 --> 00:30:04.369
All right.

00:30:04.369 --> 00:30:06.690
Now, I know that your father is fairly well-known

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:08.609
in the Roma community.

00:30:08.609 --> 00:30:11.329
And there are some deeply held traditions

00:30:11.329 --> 00:30:15.049
that had an impact on you concerning your schooling.

00:30:15.049 --> 00:30:15.650
Yeah.

00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:17.529
Culturally, among the Roma people,

00:30:17.529 --> 00:30:20.009
it was expected that the oldest girls

00:30:20.009 --> 00:30:23.049
stopped going in school when she is quite young.

00:30:23.049 --> 00:30:26.329
So my father wanted me to stop to go in school.

00:30:26.329 --> 00:30:29.329
And honestly, I was very unhappy because of that

00:30:29.329 --> 00:30:31.690
because I really love to go in school.

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:37.809
So I told my father that I will respect his decision.

00:30:37.809 --> 00:30:40.490
But also, I took the opportunity to explain to him

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:42.769
that he wanted to pioneer.

00:30:42.769 --> 00:30:46.250
I explained to him what that meant, and he agreed.

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:47.170
Well, that was very good.

00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:49.009
So you respected your father's wishes,

00:30:49.009 --> 00:30:53.329
but also clearly set out your spiritual goals.

00:30:53.329 --> 00:30:55.970
We're glad you supported you in that.

00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:58.210
But now that you're out preaching in the town,

00:30:58.210 --> 00:30:59.849
that must have called attention.

00:30:59.849 --> 00:31:00.690
Yes.

00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:04.369
A neighbor approached to my father about it, and he said,

00:31:04.369 --> 00:31:05.289
you're Muslim.

00:31:05.289 --> 00:31:08.210
Why do I allow your daughter to go house in the house?

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:10.930
And my father told to him.

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:12.529
He never had a problem with it.

00:31:12.529 --> 00:31:15.849
His girls, since they start to study the Bible.

00:31:15.849 --> 00:31:18.970
Oh, you're good conducts, spoke out there.

00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:21.170
Now, we know that unfortunately war broke out

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:25.650
in the region, and Kosovo was affected.

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:27.809
And at that time, there were no brothers in the area.

00:31:27.809 --> 00:31:30.049
There was no congregation, no meetings,

00:31:30.049 --> 00:31:33.609
and even your father and brothers were not there.

00:31:33.609 --> 00:31:37.329
At that time, leaving you, your sister, and your mother

00:31:37.329 --> 00:31:39.569
to rely on Jehovah there.

00:31:39.569 --> 00:31:40.930
And we know Jehovah can do that,

00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:43.250
but it can be very stressful.

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:46.369
But there was an additional situation that arose.

00:31:46.369 --> 00:31:47.369
Tell us about that.

00:31:47.369 --> 00:31:50.970
Our neighbor had a basement and in his house,

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:53.769
and many of us, our area was bombed.

00:31:53.769 --> 00:31:56.250
Many of us took shelter there.

00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:58.049
Physically, it was safe.

00:31:58.049 --> 00:32:01.130
But people talk about that, how we were going to die,

00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:05.930
and about that horrible things that could be happened to us.

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:08.809
And it was very discouraging to listen to that.

00:32:08.809 --> 00:32:12.130
I realized that was a bad association.

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:15.490
I had to make a change to keep spiritually alive.

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:17.289
All right, so you had the basement,

00:32:17.289 --> 00:32:18.970
which served as a bomb shelter,

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:23.210
giving physical security, but it came with bad association.

00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:25.289
So you said you had to make a change.

00:32:25.289 --> 00:32:26.730
What did you do?

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:31.569
We stayed home, read the experience from the yearbook.

00:32:31.569 --> 00:32:34.049
We held the meetings in our kitchen,

00:32:34.049 --> 00:32:37.329
and also we read and started the Bible.

00:32:37.329 --> 00:32:39.210
We prayed together.

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:42.650
This built up our faith and Jehovah help us when you were.

00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:44.769
And what has been the result?

00:32:44.769 --> 00:32:48.250
Jehovah has given me the best school here at the Gillette,

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:52.450
and also the best association with my fellow classmates.

00:32:52.450 --> 00:32:54.009
Well, we thank all of you for sharing

00:32:54.009 --> 00:32:56.569
some of your experiences involving decisions

00:32:56.569 --> 00:33:00.730
that helped you be here today with Jehovah's blessing.

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:03.930
Well, the scene of the world is changing,

00:33:03.970 --> 00:33:08.049
but our faithfulness to Jehovah remains steadfast.

00:33:08.049 --> 00:33:10.369
May Jehovah continue to bless the students

00:33:10.369 --> 00:33:12.849
of the 141st class of Gilead

00:33:12.849 --> 00:33:15.490
and the entire worldwide brotherhood

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:35.460
as we work shoulder to shoulder to Jehovah's praise.

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:36.299
Thank you very much.

00:33:36.299 --> 00:33:40.140
We always enjoy the experiences in the field

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:42.220
as well as their personal experiences.

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:45.299
Next brother, Ronald Kursin,

00:33:45.299 --> 00:33:47.460
helper to the teaching committee.

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:50.539
It's going to interview others from the class

00:33:50.539 --> 00:33:53.099
and the question and his theme is,

00:33:53.099 --> 00:33:55.700
how will you use your gift?

00:33:57.539 --> 00:34:00.220
We all love gifts.

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:03.900
We love to receive gifts and we like to give gifts.

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:05.940
And where do we get that from?

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:08.900
The originator of gift giving, Jehovah God,

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:13.139
he loves to give good gifts and perfect presents.

00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:16.940
And of Jehovah's gifts, the insight in the scriptures say

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:20.380
that assignments of service in God's organization

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:23.380
are really gifts from Jehovah.

00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:25.460
Those favored with assignments of service

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.500
by God's undeserved kindness

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:30.460
are also called gifts in men.

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:33.179
And we can say gifts in women.

00:34:33.179 --> 00:34:36.059
And what do they do with this gift?

00:34:36.059 --> 00:34:37.860
They're given to the congregation

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:40.139
in order that its members individually

00:34:40.139 --> 00:34:43.699
might be built up and attain maturity.

00:34:44.699 --> 00:34:48.139
Gilead School is a precious gift from Jehovah

00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:52.340
that has enabled 141 classes to do just that.

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:56.179
Build up their brothers and their sisters.

00:34:56.179 --> 00:35:01.179
The question is, how will the 141st class use this gift?

00:35:01.699 --> 00:35:03.179
Well, let's find out.

00:35:03.179 --> 00:35:06.139
We have four students that we would like to interview

00:35:06.139 --> 00:35:09.019
to single students and a married couple.

00:35:09.019 --> 00:35:10.940
First of all, we have Anita Shoomi,

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:13.099
who is originally from Austria.

00:35:13.139 --> 00:35:15.820
We have Ben Pritchard from Britain

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:19.099
and a married couple from the United States,

00:35:19.099 --> 00:35:21.340
Neil and Diane Ryan.

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:23.780
In preparing for this interview,

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:27.179
it was very heartwarming to learn that all four of you

00:35:27.179 --> 00:35:30.179
received a precious gift from Jehovah.

00:35:30.179 --> 00:35:32.820
And that is being raised in the truth

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:34.380
by God-fearing parents

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:37.940
who instilled a love for Jehovah in your hearts

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:40.420
as well as the pioneer spirit.

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:43.539
So eventually, all four of you pioneered.

00:35:43.539 --> 00:35:44.539
But here's a question.

00:35:44.539 --> 00:35:46.300
We'll start out with Anita.

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:48.619
What other gifts of service did you receive

00:35:48.619 --> 00:35:51.539
from Jehovah before coming to Gilead?

00:35:52.739 --> 00:35:54.739
After my schooling, I moved to France

00:35:54.739 --> 00:35:56.579
and started pioneering.

00:35:56.579 --> 00:35:59.059
There were many Tamil-speaking people in the territory.

00:35:59.059 --> 00:36:00.780
So I started learning that language

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:03.500
and finally moved to Asia.

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:07.059
Then I was invited to serve in the Tamil field in Germany

00:36:07.059 --> 00:36:08.539
as a special pioneer.

00:36:08.579 --> 00:36:10.860
And after seven wonderful years there,

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:13.500
I was sent back to Asia, where I now am.

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:14.699
Thank you, and Ben.

00:36:15.699 --> 00:36:19.300
A few years after attending the ministerial training school

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:23.260
in England, I was assigned to Bikina Faso in West Africa,

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:24.420
serving as a missionary,

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:27.340
which is where I've been serving up until now.

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:29.980
A big challenge for me was learning

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:33.019
the local African language called Moray.

00:36:33.019 --> 00:36:35.420
And after about a year or so of learning

00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:37.059
and struggling with the language,

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:40.460
I wasn't really up to reading the paragraphs

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:42.260
or saying a prayer at the book study.

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:44.940
However, it was at that point that I was invited

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:47.420
to take up the traveling work on the circuit

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:49.260
in that very language.

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:51.980
In fact, the first full length talk

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:54.820
that I did in the language was the needs of the circuit

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:56.380
at the circuit assembly.

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:59.139
But with Holy Spirit and a lot of patience

00:36:59.139 --> 00:37:00.699
on the part of the brothers,

00:37:00.699 --> 00:37:02.940
I was able gradually to get to Grasps

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:04.739
and with the challenge.

00:37:04.739 --> 00:37:06.099
Jehovah certainly helped you.

00:37:07.099 --> 00:37:08.900
Well, after Neil and I were married,

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:10.739
I went and joined him at Brooklyn Bethel

00:37:10.739 --> 00:37:13.780
and we served there together until 2004,

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:16.340
and then we left to assist family.

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:17.500
And we pioneered together,

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:20.539
and then in 2009, our circumstances opened up

00:37:20.539 --> 00:37:22.860
and we reapplied for Bethel's service.

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:24.860
However, we were encouraged at that time

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:27.099
to pursue other theocratic goals.

00:37:27.099 --> 00:37:28.780
So that's when we started considering

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:32.300
serving in a foreign country.

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:34.219
And I must say, we were definitely nervous

00:37:34.219 --> 00:37:36.739
about going to another country, foreign.

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:38.980
But we prayed about it and we did research.

00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:42.940
And then we wrote 31 letters to various branches

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:45.380
to see if we could serve in their territory,

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:47.739
and we got invited to serve in Ghana.

00:37:47.739 --> 00:37:50.579
So we've been at the Ghana branch for almost six years now,

00:37:50.579 --> 00:37:52.820
and although we were very hesitant at first,

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:54.179
we're very glad we moved,

00:37:54.179 --> 00:37:56.780
and we enjoy that assignment very much.

00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:59.300
So no doubt, serving in a foreign country

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:02.420
has so many blessings, so many rewards,

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:04.619
but also it has its challenges.

00:38:04.619 --> 00:38:07.019
So how have the local brothers and sisters

00:38:07.019 --> 00:38:09.500
become gifts and men and gifts and women

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:12.780
to help you to adjust Anita?

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:15.260
Not only did they give me a lot of practical help

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:18.699
to settle in, they also patiently explained to me

00:38:18.699 --> 00:38:22.460
the meaning and the feelings behind cultural habits,

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:25.380
and that's worth so much in order to adapt.

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:28.059
So despite cultural differences initially,

00:38:28.059 --> 00:38:30.739
many brothers, they took me in like family.

00:38:30.739 --> 00:38:33.099
I realized how much more I have in common

00:38:33.099 --> 00:38:35.099
is my brothers in other countries

00:38:35.099 --> 00:38:37.900
than with people from my birth country

00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:41.780
or my language or my color who don't love Jehovah.

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:44.420
Listening to my brothers express their love

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:46.539
for the same father I love,

00:38:46.539 --> 00:38:50.340
and seeing how he blesses them and helps them as he helps me,

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:52.260
I feel very close to them.

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:53.420
I feel at home.

00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:56.260
We have a family wherever we go in the world.

00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:59.659
We don't only call each other's brothers and sisters,

00:38:59.659 --> 00:39:02.980
we really are, but what a gift.

00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:05.139
And through their marvelous example,

00:39:05.139 --> 00:39:08.500
many in this family, they taught me valuable lessons

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:13.500
in endurance, patience, devotion, hospitality, and so on.

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:17.059
They trained me so that I could even come here.

00:39:17.059 --> 00:39:19.340
They're a very precious gift to me.

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:21.900
Thank you for sharing that, Ben.

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:24.699
My color means that everywhere I go,

00:39:24.699 --> 00:39:28.380
I stand out as different to everyone else,

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:31.820
serving in the traveling work in rural areas.

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:34.500
It's very, very rare to see white people.

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:36.860
So the word that I hear called out to me

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:40.059
by the local people more than anything else

00:39:40.059 --> 00:39:44.579
from morning to evening is nasara, which means white man.

00:39:44.579 --> 00:39:48.019
It means that whatever efforts you make

00:39:48.019 --> 00:39:51.780
to learn the local language and the customs,

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:54.860
you're nearly always viewed as an outsider.

00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:58.940
So in contrast, though, the friendship and support

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:02.019
that I enjoy from the local brothers

00:40:02.019 --> 00:40:07.300
really is a gift being taken in by the brothers

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:09.539
eating with them, living with their family,

00:40:09.539 --> 00:40:12.179
and being treated by them as family,

00:40:12.179 --> 00:40:15.619
whilst outsiders look on, perhaps surprised.

00:40:15.619 --> 00:40:17.340
That really is special.

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:19.340
A favorite moment for me in services

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:21.900
when an African brother working with me

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:24.940
will introduce me as my brother.

00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:27.059
And sometimes the reaction from the householder

00:40:27.059 --> 00:40:28.420
is how can he be your brother?

00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:30.780
He's white and you're black.

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:32.900
Then often the reaction will come from the brother.

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:35.500
Well, he's more my brother than anyone born

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:36.940
in the same village as me.

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:38.380
So when you hear that kind of statement

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:41.219
in those circumstances, it's really a gift.

00:40:41.219 --> 00:40:46.059
But more than that, I think that the support and friendship

00:40:46.059 --> 00:40:48.659
from so many brothers in my assignments

00:40:48.659 --> 00:40:51.860
has helped me to keep a positive attitude.

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:53.820
And I can really say it's because of that,

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:58.420
it's because of them that I qualify to be here

00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:01.820
and to enjoy this undeserved privilege of Gilead.

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:03.099
And because of that, I've really

00:41:03.099 --> 00:41:05.900
filled the responsibility now to go back, get to work,

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:08.739
and to pass on to others the gifts

00:41:08.739 --> 00:41:10.900
that I've been privileged to receive here.

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:11.900
Thank you.

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:14.780
And going to Ghana, what about Vienna?

00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:16.780
What do you think about the local brothers and sisters?

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:18.300
How have they helped you?

00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:20.659
I really appreciate the kindness of the brothers

00:41:20.659 --> 00:41:21.699
and sisters in Ghana.

00:41:21.699 --> 00:41:23.820
They go out of their way to help you.

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:25.619
And I remember when I was new to the country

00:41:25.619 --> 00:41:28.900
going out in the ministry, I met so many interested people,

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:31.500
but I worried, how was I ever going to find them again?

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:34.019
Because the territory oftentimes doesn't

00:41:34.019 --> 00:41:35.900
have street names and house numbers.

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:39.019
So I would just write a description of where I was.

00:41:39.019 --> 00:41:40.860
And the brothers and sisters were so kind,

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:43.460
they wouldn't just tell me how to get back to my return

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:43.780
visits.

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:46.019
They always physically took me there,

00:41:46.019 --> 00:41:48.739
even if they had to go out of their way to do it.

00:41:48.739 --> 00:41:51.619
And that kindness has been repeated in so many different ways.

00:41:51.619 --> 00:41:53.820
I don't have time to relate, but it

00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:56.420
helped me not only to adjust to my assignment in Ghana,

00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:59.179
but also to stay in it and even to be able to come here

00:41:59.179 --> 00:42:00.780
to Gilead today.

00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:04.420
And Neil, I'd say being in a new assignment

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:06.739
away from family and friends, you definitely

00:42:06.739 --> 00:42:08.940
have your ups and downs, especially

00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:11.980
in the beginning, but that scripture in Colossians 4

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:15.179
and verse number 11 helps me to see that my brothers

00:42:15.179 --> 00:42:17.780
can be a source of great comfort or strength

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:19.179
and an aid to us.

00:42:19.179 --> 00:42:22.059
And we definitely felt that with the satellites there

00:42:22.059 --> 00:42:24.380
in Ghana and the congregation, they

00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:27.059
were like a second family to us.

00:42:27.059 --> 00:42:29.940
They invited us over for hospitality right away.

00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:31.539
If you looked a little down, you got

00:42:31.539 --> 00:42:35.219
an extra warm smile or a hug or an arm around you,

00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:37.380
they just accepted us a part of their family.

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:40.059
And I can definitely say that's one of the main reasons

00:42:40.059 --> 00:42:42.139
why we're still in that assignment.

00:42:42.139 --> 00:42:43.820
And we really appreciate this gift

00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:45.460
of the worldwide brotherhood.

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:48.139
It's really helped us to be where we are today,

00:42:48.139 --> 00:42:50.420
the tasting of this undeserved kindness.

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:54.659
So a reoccurring theme that gifts in men, gifts in women

00:42:54.659 --> 00:42:56.619
really have helped you to adjust.

00:42:56.619 --> 00:42:59.579
And I'm sure you will use that going forward.

00:42:59.579 --> 00:43:02.820
Now, you have received many gifts of training at Gilead

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:05.500
thus far over the last couple of months.

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:07.860
Is there a specific gem or a gift that

00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:09.619
has really touched your heart that you would like

00:43:09.619 --> 00:43:11.619
to share with us?

00:43:11.619 --> 00:43:14.659
So often I was made aware of how little I measure up

00:43:14.659 --> 00:43:17.500
to Jehovah's image in my personality.

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:20.659
And that awareness is good for developing more humility,

00:43:20.659 --> 00:43:23.539
but it can be also quite discouraging at times.

00:43:23.539 --> 00:43:26.900
It's a struggle to come to that sound mind,

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:31.099
that balance between, I'm not always an outstanding success,

00:43:31.099 --> 00:43:33.780
but I'm not a constant failure either.

00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:36.179
And the course was a marvelous training

00:43:36.179 --> 00:43:38.860
and how not to concentrate on my strong points only.

00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:40.780
That's unrealistic.

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:43.980
But also how not to concentrate on my weaknesses only

00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:47.219
and then despair, because that's unhealthy as well.

00:43:47.219 --> 00:43:51.460
And that ignores Jehovah's mercy and his patience with us.

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:53.619
And he showers us with his affections

00:43:53.619 --> 00:43:56.380
and wants us to feel joy in serving him.

00:43:56.380 --> 00:44:00.340
So I will continue to pray for Jehovah's help in this regard,

00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:02.980
because I want Jehovah to feel more joy

00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:06.820
when he watches my thinking and my feelings become

00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:09.019
more balanced, more pleasing to him.

00:44:09.019 --> 00:44:10.139
It's very well expressed.

00:44:10.139 --> 00:44:12.739
We'll remember that at Ben.

00:44:12.739 --> 00:44:15.619
For me, one point was regarding Abraham,

00:44:15.619 --> 00:44:18.420
who after having as good as offered up Isaac,

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:21.019
never understood the rest of his life,

00:44:21.019 --> 00:44:24.659
the reason why Jehovah asked him to do that specific thing

00:44:24.659 --> 00:44:26.900
as a test of his faith.

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:32.539
However, he didn't then go on to negotiate with Jehovah,

00:44:32.539 --> 00:44:36.260
either beforehand or after, as he had done 25 years before

00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:38.619
with Lot and Sodom and Gomorrah.

00:44:38.619 --> 00:44:43.619
He didn't obsess with the question, why would Jehovah

00:44:43.619 --> 00:44:46.659
allow me to go through such a traumatic experience?

00:44:46.659 --> 00:44:47.860
Why, why, why?

00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:51.500
He just got on with faithfully serving Jehovah.

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:54.699
And in the resurrection, he, like us,

00:44:54.699 --> 00:44:56.260
who understand the reason why,

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:59.340
he will come to understand the reason why and feel privileged.

00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:03.139
So the application that was made, the question was asked of us,

00:45:03.139 --> 00:45:07.539
what is your personal Isaac, perhaps a situation

00:45:07.539 --> 00:45:10.699
in this system of things that will never be rid of

00:45:10.699 --> 00:45:15.500
or a change of assignment, a reassignment,

00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:17.980
another difficult change in our service,

00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:21.500
rather than obsessing with the question, why,

00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:23.739
why me, why did this happen?

00:45:23.739 --> 00:45:27.980
Like Abraham, we should just carry on serving Jehovah loyally.

00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:29.300
The end.

00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:31.179
I really was affected by the lessons

00:45:31.179 --> 00:45:32.940
in the growing spiritually section.

00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:36.900
In one of them, the instructor used a vivid illustration

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:40.340
about, he said, we shouldn't let the 20 weeks of Gilead

00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:44.300
pass by without lancing the boil and cleaning out the pus.

00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:47.380
Well, as a nurse, I instantly got a mental image of that

00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:49.579
because if someone does have chronic boils

00:45:49.579 --> 00:45:50.940
and they don't do anything about it,

00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:52.739
it could make them very sick.

00:45:52.739 --> 00:45:56.139
So I thought in a spiritual way, if, through my in-depth study

00:45:56.139 --> 00:45:59.780
of the Bible, I found negative qualities in my personality.

00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:02.980
And I did nothing about it that spiritually,

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:07.340
that could infect my whole personality and make me spiritually

00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:09.780
sick, and then not as useful to Jehovah

00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:11.179
as I could be.

00:46:11.179 --> 00:46:13.380
And Neil, a gem for you.

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:16.019
Well, time and again, it was sounded down into our minds

00:46:16.019 --> 00:46:19.940
and deep within our hearts, that one remains useful to Jehovah

00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:22.380
as long as one remains humble.

00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:24.260
So I thought about that, that if I begin

00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:27.420
to think that it's all about me or it's about my wife, Diane,

00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:29.539
and really forget the much larger picture,

00:46:29.539 --> 00:46:31.820
it's about Jehovah's sovereignty, his name,

00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:34.980
the disciple making work and loving and assisting the brothers.

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:37.579
We've been sent there to assist.

00:46:37.579 --> 00:46:39.579
Well, then we begin to focus on ourselves

00:46:39.579 --> 00:46:41.539
and we damage our relationship with Jehovah,

00:46:41.539 --> 00:46:44.619
and we damage those that we've been sent to help.

00:46:44.619 --> 00:46:46.380
So throughout the course,

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:50.019
scriptural warnings were studied on King Uzia, King Saul,

00:46:50.019 --> 00:46:52.579
and Korah, who started out as humble,

00:46:52.579 --> 00:46:57.380
but they lost that humility and became very prideful.

00:46:57.380 --> 00:47:00.500
They forgot the place that Jehovah had put them in.

00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:03.739
And I won't forget a point made by a governing body member

00:47:03.739 --> 00:47:05.739
that was relating what Brother Noor used to say

00:47:05.739 --> 00:47:08.059
to the students, to Gilead students.

00:47:08.059 --> 00:47:11.460
He said that if you leave Gilead with a bigger head

00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:14.500
than a bigger heart, then we have failed you.

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:16.820
So we want to be very willing to be humble

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:19.460
and do whatever Jehovah has asked of us.

00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:22.980
So how do you plan on using this beautiful gift

00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:25.539
of Gilead training, Anita?

00:47:25.539 --> 00:47:28.780
The whole Gilead experiences stressed how much Jehovah cares

00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:30.980
for each of our brothers.

00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:33.179
For example, in first Kings 10, 9,

00:47:33.179 --> 00:47:36.420
we learned that Jehovah put Salaman in place as King,

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:40.059
not for Salaman's glory, but he was used as a channel

00:47:40.059 --> 00:47:42.900
for Jehovah to show his love for Israel.

00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:45.380
So likewise, Jehovah gave us this training here,

00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:48.699
not for our glory, but for our brothers.

00:47:48.699 --> 00:47:53.460
He equipped us to take care of our brothers

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:56.780
in a more loving way, to transmit the gifts

00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:59.860
and Jehovah's love to them, make them feel his care

00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:02.179
and strengthen their attachment to Jehovah.

00:48:02.179 --> 00:48:06.539
So I'm eager to return and try my best to do just that.

00:48:06.539 --> 00:48:09.940
As a little thank you to Jehovah for the marvelous time here,

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:12.619
but also as a thank you to my brothers back home,

00:48:12.619 --> 00:48:14.699
to whom I owe so much.

00:48:14.699 --> 00:48:15.940
Very good, and Ben.

00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:19.179
It's true that Gilead has given us knowledge,

00:48:19.179 --> 00:48:22.820
but Gilead isn't about knowing things.

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:26.619
So I want to keep in mind what Ephesians 3 verse 19 says,

00:48:26.619 --> 00:48:29.099
the love of the Christ surpasses knowledge,

00:48:29.099 --> 00:48:32.579
which means taking knowledge and then transforming it

00:48:32.579 --> 00:48:37.059
into experience by imitation, imitation of Christ.

00:48:38.059 --> 00:48:41.099
So I hope to be a better imitator of Christ

00:48:41.099 --> 00:48:46.019
as I go back and serve with the brothers,

00:48:46.019 --> 00:48:50.340
but that means not just imitating Jesus in my actions,

00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:53.099
but also coming to have the same feelings

00:48:53.099 --> 00:48:57.659
that Jesus has about things and about people.

00:48:59.179 --> 00:49:03.860
In addition to that, Jehovah really has given me so many gifts

00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:09.780
in men here at Gilead that have helped me to increase my love

00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:14.539
for him, but also to have a real deep affection

00:49:14.539 --> 00:49:16.539
for the organization that he's using.

00:49:16.539 --> 00:49:20.300
So as I go back, I want to be a factor in helping others

00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:23.500
to come to see how much Jehovah loves them

00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:28.139
and see how wonderful the organization that he is using really is.

00:49:28.179 --> 00:49:31.059
And last, we'll hear from the Ryan's, the end.

00:49:32.019 --> 00:49:35.260
In Psalm 78, 5 through 7, it speaks of parents

00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:38.260
making known Jehovah's reminders to the next generation

00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:40.659
so they can put their confidence in Jehovah.

00:49:40.659 --> 00:49:43.739
And I'd like to do something similar when I go back to Ghana,

00:49:43.739 --> 00:49:45.500
especially with the young ones,

00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:48.860
to share the many spiritual gems that I've been given

00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:53.019
so that they can more fully put their confidence in Jehovah.

00:49:53.019 --> 00:49:56.619
So I'd like to do that whenever I see them at the meetings,

00:49:56.619 --> 00:49:59.059
we're talking before and after and working with them

00:49:59.059 --> 00:50:02.019
in the ministry when they come over to visit me in my room

00:50:02.019 --> 00:50:04.699
at Bethel, really, whatever opportunity I have

00:50:04.699 --> 00:50:06.380
to share those gems with them.

00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:10.940
And second Timothy chapter 2 and verse number 2 reminds me

00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:13.739
that after we've received this beautiful training,

00:50:13.739 --> 00:50:16.059
we have responsibility and that is in turn

00:50:16.059 --> 00:50:18.219
to teach or train others.

00:50:18.219 --> 00:50:19.900
So as I go back to my assignment,

00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:22.940
I hope to keep learning from the brothers and sisters there,

00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:25.699
but also to share these gems and gifts with them,

00:50:25.699 --> 00:50:29.420
not as a heavy downpour that drowns our brothers and sisters,

00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:32.460
but as a gentle shower that encourages them,

00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:34.619
for example, I love to work with the young ones

00:50:34.619 --> 00:50:36.860
and share the experience of young Samuel

00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:38.659
when he went to the tabernacle

00:50:38.659 --> 00:50:40.460
and how he has served Jehovah faithfully

00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:43.300
despite the wicked influence of Eli's two sons,

00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:45.500
and that they too can be faithful

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:48.940
despite the negative influence of this world around them.

00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:51.659
If we share these gifts with the brothers and sisters

00:50:51.659 --> 00:50:54.940
like a gentle shower, we'll show that we haven't

00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:57.380
missed the purpose of this Gilead training

00:50:57.380 --> 00:51:00.019
and that is to encourage and strengthen the brothers

00:51:00.019 --> 00:51:02.619
and bring honor and glory to Jehovah.

00:51:02.619 --> 00:51:05.179
We'd like to thank all four of you for your heartfelt comments

00:51:05.179 --> 00:51:07.579
and you expressed yourself so well

00:51:07.579 --> 00:51:10.179
and you represented the rest of your class so well.

00:51:10.179 --> 00:51:12.380
So with Jehovah's help, we know that you will use

00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:14.500
all the gifts that have been given to you

00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:17.500
to be a gift to all those in your assignments.

00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:34.079
Thank you.

00:51:34.079 --> 00:51:35.719
Thank you very much for the present.

00:51:35.719 --> 00:51:38.199
I was very refreshing.

00:51:38.239 --> 00:51:41.360
I appreciate them sharing those thoughts.

00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:44.719
Now we invite you to stand and we'll sing this

00:51:44.719 --> 00:51:47.639
beloved song number 29,

00:51:47.639 --> 00:51:51.320
walking in integrity, song number 29.
