00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:08.750
Welcome to the Love Never Fails Convention of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:15.750
We are so happy that you were able to arrange your affairs to attend all three days of this convention.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.750
We are sure that it will help you to get to know our loving Heavenly Father better,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:29.750
draw closer to Him and fortify you for the tests and challenges that will face in the coming days.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:38.750
Why were the words at first Corinthians 13 verse 8 chosen as the theme for this year's convention?

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.750
Because there's no other quality that's more important to Jehovah than love.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.750
Jehovah is both the personification and the very source of love.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.750
It's his dominant quality.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.750
Everything he does is motivated by love.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.750
We cannot properly think of Jehovah without thinking of love.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.750
The Apostle John was inspired to say that God is love.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:18.750
When John wrote that, he used the same Greek word for love that the Apostle Paul used at first Corinthians 13-8, Agape.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:26.750
True, the scriptures use forms of the Greek word filia when encouraging Christians to have affection for one another.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:36.750
Jesus even used the form of this word when saying that the Father has affection for the Son and shows Him all the things He Himself does.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:47.750
But more frequently, the Bible uses the word Agape to indicate the love, Jehovah God and Jesus Christ have for each other.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.750
As used in the scriptures, Agape involves more than an emotional response to another person.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.750
This word often conveys the meaning of love guided by principle.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:06.750
And it includes devotion to righteousness and sincere concern for the lasting welfare of others.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.750
Why? Agape can even be shown to total strangers or even enemies.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.750
To love people who don't love us back.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.750
To love people we don't even like.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:29.750
Or to love those who persecute us is a victory, an achievement, a conquest over all our natural inclinations and emotions.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.750
It requires moral sense and awareness of duty, principle and propriety.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.750
True Christians are thus trained to show love on purpose, to love at will.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.750
Such love is the crowning quality of our Christian personality.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:56.750
Such unselfish love is what moved Jehovah to create and it's what moved him to send his son to die for our sins.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:07.750
Why does the governing body want all of us to comprehend fully what is the breadth and length and height and depth and to know the love of the Christ?

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:17.750
This comprehension and experience will help us not only to get a fuller appreciation for the love Jehovah and Jesus have for us,

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:25.750
but it will also equip us to show love in more ways and to a greater degree than ever before.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:35.750
Such love will identify us as the true disciples of Jesus, allowing us to serve as beacons of light in this dark world.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:51.750
And it will unite us with an unbreakable bond during what will be one of the darkest times in human history when the coalition of nations called Gag of Megag will attempt to annihilate God's people.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.750
How do we know that Agape can do all of that?

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:05.750
Because at Colossians 3, 14 we are assured that Agape is a perfect bond of union.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:16.750
That perfect bond is so strong that we consider ourselves under obligation to surrender our lives for our brothers, if need be.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:23.750
Clearly, cultivating Christian love is a matter of life and death.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:31.750
So please pay rapt attention to the talks and videos, look up the scriptures and read them along with the speakers,

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.750
thus allowing God's word to exert its powerful force on your heart.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:47.750
And may this convention become a milestone in your development as a humble imitator of your incomparable and grand creator.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:56.750
We love you very much, and the same desire that the Apostle Paul expressed to the congregation in Bessalonica,

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:04.750
which we find at first Dessalonians 3, 12, is also our heartful wish for you.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:14.750
May the Lord cause you to increase, yes, to abound in love for one another and for all, just as we do for you.
