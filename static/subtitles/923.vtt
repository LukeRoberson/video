00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.370
Welcome one and all the concluding session of our Pursue Peace Convention is about to begin

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.289
As you watch the music video presentation

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:42.250
Reflect on how learning about our creator and speaking about him to others can help us endure any test of faith with joy and peace

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.539
Please enjoy the video

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:29.840
Please enjoy the video presentation

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:46.919
Reflect on how learning about him to others can help us endure any test of faith with joy and peace

00:03:46.919 --> 00:04:02.039
Please enjoy the video presentation

00:07:43.959 --> 00:09:48.340
Welcome to the final portion of this convention, which corresponds to the Sunday afternoon session on your program

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:52.980
The scripture theme is taken from Romans 15 13

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.460
Which says in part

00:09:55.460 --> 00:10:00.100
May the God who gives hope fill you with all joy and peace

00:10:01.539 --> 00:10:06.379
To begin let's sing a song that describes the blessings that God's kingdom will bring

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:12.299
The song is number 23 entitled Jehovah begins his rule

00:10:13.179 --> 00:13:47.500
Song number 23 in part one of our feature Bible drama

00:13:48.299 --> 00:13:52.139
We saw how Jehovah gave peace to his servants in the past as

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.620
We near the conclusion of this system of things

00:13:56.299 --> 00:14:03.419
How can we strengthen our confidence that Jehovah will fulfill his promises for the future?

00:14:04.419 --> 00:14:08.059
We now invite you to watch part two of the feature Bible drama

00:14:09.059 --> 00:14:11.580
Jehovah guides us in the way of peace

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:29.059
Bible prophecy is a fascinating subject

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:33.799
Prophecy is far more than just predictions about the future

00:14:34.899 --> 00:14:36.899
Jehovah knows all the facts

00:14:37.379 --> 00:14:41.620
He can even control and change factors to ensure the outcome he desires

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.820
At Isaiah 55 11 he says

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:53.500
My word that goes out of my mouth will not return to me without results and it will have sure success

00:14:55.379 --> 00:14:58.860
Jehovah's prophecies have a perfect record of success

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:01.580
He has led his people in the past

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:08.779
So when he prophesies that he'll lead his people to real lasting peace in the future

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:11.580
This is in a prediction

00:15:11.659 --> 00:15:13.179
It's a guarantee

00:15:13.179 --> 00:15:21.740
The prophecies given to Daniel clearly show that God's kingdom will without a doubt bring lasting peace for all mankind

00:15:22.019 --> 00:15:47.710
I found a man from the axiles of Judah who could make no interpretation to the king

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:49.990
I know who he is

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:56.080
Can you really make known to me the dream that I saw that it's interpretation?

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:07.940
This is your dream

00:16:09.379 --> 00:16:14.220
Jehovah is the great time keeper

00:16:15.019 --> 00:16:23.299
The prophetic portions of the book of Daniel built faith by showing that Jehovah knows the course of history centuries even millenniums in advance

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:32.340
While portions of these prophecies were fulfilled in Daniel's time many of the details are being fulfilled right down to our day

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:45.440
So as we discover the significance of these prophecies we're excited about what lies ahead and our confidence grows as we discern how Jehovah has been leading his people all along

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.840
In the days of those kingdoms

00:16:50.159 --> 00:16:52.960
The God of heaven will set up a kingdom

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.720
That will never be destroyed

00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:02.779
The divine dream that Daniel interprets for King Nebuchadnezzar

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:05.940
constitutes a prophecy

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:09.099
Crucial for the lasting peace of mankind

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:18.339
A promise from Jehovah to set up a kingdom that would be vastly superior to earthly kingdoms

00:17:19.299 --> 00:17:25.380
History has shown us how every type of human government imaginable has failed

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:29.859
So how would Jehovah's government come?

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.900
When would it arrive?

00:17:33.619 --> 00:17:37.539
These were questions Daniel himself likely had

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:46.250
Jehovah is a revealer of secrets

00:17:47.049 --> 00:17:50.529
He would eventually answer these questions in due time

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:57.529
As a diligent student of the Scriptures, the prophet Daniel had full faith and confidence in

00:17:57.809 --> 00:18:03.970
Jehovah's ability to schedule events and bring them about and now likely in his 90s

00:18:04.849 --> 00:18:07.809
Daniel was particularly interested in prophecies

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:12.049
Regarding the restoration of his beloved city Jerusalem

00:18:16.349 --> 00:18:21.230
70 years at Babylon are fulfilled. I will turn my attention to you

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:25.349
And I will make good my promise

00:18:27.279 --> 00:18:30.079
By bringing you back to this place

00:18:33.809 --> 00:18:40.970
Jeremiah's prophecy had given Daniel hope because it indicated that Jews would soon return to their homeland of Judah and

00:18:41.089 --> 00:18:43.089
Rebuild Jerusalem along with its temple

00:18:43.809 --> 00:18:50.289
Now make sense that Daniel would be interested in the restoration of the temple because from the time of King Solomon

00:18:50.529 --> 00:18:55.170
The temple in Jerusalem was the world center for worship of Jehovah

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:57.650
So it was very important to the Jews

00:18:58.049 --> 00:19:03.410
In the Scriptures, the temple was often called the House of Jehovah

00:19:04.529 --> 00:19:11.170
Now after Jehovah allowed young Daniel on the rest of the Israelites to be taken captive to Babylon

00:19:12.049 --> 00:19:15.250
The city of Jerusalem and the temple were destroyed

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:22.529
So naturally a God-fearing man like Daniel would be interested in seeing the temple rebuilt

00:19:23.809 --> 00:19:28.849
Again as a man of faith Daniel suffocates Jehovah

00:19:31.869 --> 00:19:33.869
Oh Jehovah

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:36.190
He's due here

00:19:38.829 --> 00:19:39.950
To forgive

00:19:40.269 --> 00:19:42.589
Oh Jehovah, do be attention and act

00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:47.230
To not delay for your own sake

00:19:48.029 --> 00:19:50.029
Oh my God

00:19:54.589 --> 00:20:00.990
Oh Daniel, I'm to give you insight and understanding

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:09.920
The visit of this angel gave Daniel some answers and a hope

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:15.599
Jehovah's messenger provided so many details of promises to come

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:20.880
Jehovah assured Daniel that the Jews would be restored to their homeland

00:20:21.519 --> 00:20:24.799
Their exile in Babylonia was almost over

00:20:25.839 --> 00:20:28.400
But that wasn't the end of the angel's message

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:33.920
He gave Daniel insight into something of far greater significance

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:39.200
Daniel was told when God's people could expect the arrival of the foretold Messiah

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:44.000
The Messiah would be the ruler who would make it possible for obedient humans

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.319
to regain the blessing of perfect life

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.200
Free from sickness, free from death

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.160
The Messiah would pave the way for lasting peace for mankind

00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:00.299
What a strengthening message for Daniel to receive

00:21:01.259 --> 00:21:03.259
And he likely had some questions

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:10.460
The angel told Daniel that Jerusalem and its temple would be rebuilt before the Messiah arrived

00:21:10.779 --> 00:21:15.420
Yet at the time Jerusalem and the temple were in shambles

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:19.660
How would they rebuild it and who would be responsible for this

00:21:20.539 --> 00:21:23.420
Babylon had been overtaken by Mito Persia

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:27.420
pictured by the silver chest and arms of Nebuchadnezzar's dream image

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:33.869
Not long after this change in world rulership

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:36.910
Persian King Cyrus issued a royal decree

00:21:37.869 --> 00:21:43.710
It was a commission from Cyrus himself for the Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:55.549
King Cyrus released the Jews was in notable contrast with the Babylonians desire to keep them captive

00:21:56.190 --> 00:22:00.990
Cyrus even authorized funds from the king's house to cover construction expenses

00:22:01.869 --> 00:22:08.509
Why would this pagan ruler have any interest in first of all letting the captive Jews free

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:10.670
And secondly

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:14.109
Financing the rebuilding of their temple in Jerusalem

00:22:15.069 --> 00:22:19.230
Ezra's words at second chronicles 3622 tell us

00:22:19.869 --> 00:22:24.109
Jehovah stirred the spirit of King Cyrus of Persia

00:22:25.069 --> 00:22:30.029
Jehovah can maneuver events to make sure his word is fulfilled

00:22:31.069 --> 00:22:34.109
He can use anyone to accomplish his purpose

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:40.589
And this would include even a foreign king like Cyrus so with this decree

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:43.789
The Jews returned to Judah

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:55.019
Launching a construction project and resettling an entire city was a major undertaking

00:22:55.980 --> 00:23:04.299
High priest Jeshua and governors rubble were appointed to take the lead in setting up the altar and rebuilding the temple

00:23:05.339 --> 00:23:07.339
But this wasn't without his challenges

00:23:08.299 --> 00:23:14.220
Enemies of Judah sought to sabotage the building of the temple attempting to disrupt the peace

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:24.619
Initial attempts to halt the building progress fail however eventually these enemies succeeded in having an official band placed on the temple building work

00:23:25.819 --> 00:23:27.819
What was the problem here?

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:34.539
It appears the Jews let fear of man stop the building work after about 14 years of constant opposition

00:23:38.049 --> 00:23:40.769
Now there's a bigger picture of play here

00:23:40.769 --> 00:23:48.210
Remember Daniel's prophecy foretold that Jerusalem and its temple would be rebuilt before the Messiah arrived

00:23:49.329 --> 00:23:53.250
Yet with the work halted the temple remained unfinished

00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:55.890
What would that mean for the coming of the Messiah

00:23:56.609 --> 00:23:59.250
Jeshua and Zerubbable need a guidance

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:05.650
This is where Jehovah steps in to provide encouragement first through the prophet Haggai

00:24:08.559 --> 00:24:12.400
Haggai is clear and powerful message gets right to the heart of the matter

00:24:13.039 --> 00:24:17.920
He conveys Jehovah's direction to get up and keep building the temple despite opposition

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.299
The Jews had a decision to make here

00:24:23.259 --> 00:24:25.579
Would they allow opposition to hinder the work

00:24:26.299 --> 00:24:30.539
Or would they listen to Jehovah's words through Haggai and keep rebuilding the temple

00:24:31.259 --> 00:24:35.339
To guide them further Jehovah spoke to the prophet Zechariah

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:38.619
And gave him visions to provide the Jews with a message

00:24:39.259 --> 00:24:46.619
Zechariah made it clear to the Jews that Jehovah would not allow their opposers to harm them or thwart the temple rebuilding work

00:24:47.259 --> 00:24:50.299
It was only with Jehovah's guidance that the Jews would succeed

00:24:51.259 --> 00:24:54.940
Energized by Jehovah's motivating words through these two prophets

00:24:55.420 --> 00:25:01.579
They courageously resumed construction of the temple and it was inaugurated in 515 BCE

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:08.539
Now it seems that at some point over the following decades the Jews lost their initial zeal

00:25:11.069 --> 00:25:13.789
The temple was rebuilt and inaugurated

00:25:13.789 --> 00:25:18.750
But Jerusalem's walls and gates remained unfinished with huge gaps left in them

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:23.150
And that was significant because the city was surrounded by enemy nations

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:28.029
Without the protection of these walls, Jerusalem seemed vulnerable

00:25:29.549 --> 00:25:33.470
When Nehemiah learned of this, he was visibly distressed

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:36.430
What's going on, Henei?

00:25:37.309 --> 00:25:39.309
How are people?

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:41.470
Not good

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:44.349
The conditions are disgraceful

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:47.950
The walls of Jerusalem are broken down

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:50.509
And its gates have been burned with fire

00:25:53.039 --> 00:25:54.319
What about the temple?

00:25:54.319 --> 00:25:55.519
It stands

00:25:55.519 --> 00:25:57.680
But the services are nothing but empty rituals

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:02.400
Most of the people and the priests ignore God's law

00:26:03.759 --> 00:26:07.599
Nehemiah must have been shocked to hear about the condition of Jerusalem

00:26:08.079 --> 00:26:12.000
At this time, he was serving as cup bearer to the Persian king in Shushan

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:16.319
The journey from Shushan to Jerusalem was about a thousand miles

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:20.559
Still, Nehemiah felt compelled to act

00:26:28.289 --> 00:26:31.809
Nehemiah rejoiced at the prospect of rebuilding the walls

00:26:36.579 --> 00:26:40.099
The Jews at this time were still fearful of their opposers

00:26:40.099 --> 00:26:42.420
But Nehemiah was intent on changing that

00:26:45.569 --> 00:26:48.529
He knew that Jehovah was behind the work

00:26:48.529 --> 00:26:54.769
And if Jehovah is behind something, there's no amount of opposition that can thwart his will

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:57.890
So the wall repairs began

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:05.950
This isn't to say that there were not challenges along the way

00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:08.829
Opposers did not give up

00:27:10.349 --> 00:27:16.029
I recommend we turn the accusation of sedition against Nehemiah

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:19.710
That's brilliant

00:27:20.109 --> 00:27:22.109
Yes

00:27:22.109 --> 00:27:23.869
People beg for our help

00:27:23.869 --> 00:27:26.509
These opposers threatened the Jews

00:27:26.509 --> 00:27:28.269
Schemed against them

00:27:28.269 --> 00:27:30.670
And even accused Nehemiah of treason

00:27:34.019 --> 00:27:38.900
Nehemiah's peace and the peace of the Jews supporting the work was threatened

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:42.339
But despite the attempts of opposers

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:46.900
Nehemiah and the Jews looked to Jehovah for guidance

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:48.660
And kept working

00:27:51.839 --> 00:27:54.079
When Jehovah declares his purpose

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:58.640
There is nothing that can prevent him from carrying it out

00:27:59.759 --> 00:28:03.119
So if Jehovah wanted a rebuilt Jerusalem

00:28:03.519 --> 00:28:05.359
Complete with rebuilt walls

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:12.079
Nehemiah would have complete faith in Jehovah's ability to support the rebuilding efforts

00:28:13.279 --> 00:28:14.480
And with this support

00:28:15.279 --> 00:28:19.599
The city walls were completed in just 52 days

00:28:22.019 --> 00:28:24.019
Nehemiah the wall is complete

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:34.509
With rebuilt walls and a rebuilt temple

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:37.230
Physically the city was in good condition

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:40.990
However, about 12 years later

00:28:41.549 --> 00:28:43.390
Nehemiah returned to Shushan

00:28:44.589 --> 00:28:49.069
During his prolonged absence the spiritual state of the Jews deteriorated

00:28:49.069 --> 00:28:50.109
It was so sad

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:53.789
As many in Israel fell back into bad practices

00:28:55.309 --> 00:28:58.509
Some in the priesthood including high priest Elishib

00:28:58.509 --> 00:29:01.069
No longer took their responsibilities seriously

00:29:01.789 --> 00:29:06.750
Therefore Jehovah raised up the prophet Malachi to counsel the negligent priests

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:11.470
Why have you leaveites despised Jehovah's name?

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:12.349
despised it

00:29:12.349 --> 00:29:16.589
You present a blind, lame or sick animal as a sacrifice

00:29:16.589 --> 00:29:18.349
And say that it is nothing bad

00:29:18.589 --> 00:29:20.750
Should Jehovah accept it from your hand?

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:22.430
And there's another thing you do

00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:25.150
So that he no longer looks favorably on anything you offer

00:29:25.789 --> 00:29:28.029
Because you betray the wife of your youth

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:30.910
Although she's your partner, your legal wife

00:29:32.109 --> 00:29:34.349
The lips of a priest should safeguard knowledge

00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:37.390
And people should seek the law from his mouth

00:29:38.509 --> 00:29:41.630
But you, you have made many stumble

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:48.529
Evidently Malachi's words had little effect on the priesthood

00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:53.809
Despite his warnings, the people refused to change

00:29:53.809 --> 00:29:55.089
When Nehemiah returned

00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:57.890
What he found shocked him

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:02.849
For a long time the priests and the Levites have not taken their duties seriously

00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:05.730
When the people saw that they stopped bringing in tithes

00:30:07.089 --> 00:30:08.049
Without the tithes

00:30:09.009 --> 00:30:11.089
Most Levites and singers returned to their fields

00:30:12.289 --> 00:30:16.049
Did a liaship not tell the people to bring your provisions

00:30:16.049 --> 00:30:19.970
In your absence the prophet Malachi warned him and all the priests

00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:22.849
But a liaship

00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:27.170
He took our storeroom, emptied it of our provisions

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:29.569
He gave it to buy it to use as a dining hall

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:34.539
In addition to no longer providing financial support

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:38.380
The people started conducting business on the Sabbath

00:30:40.559 --> 00:30:41.440
What are you selling today?

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.119
Only the best quality fish from tired

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.720
They were marrying foreign women

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.400
A marrying gizla today

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:50.880
Gizla

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:53.680
That mobile girl

00:30:55.359 --> 00:30:59.200
I heard you bind yourself with an oath and a curse not to take away from the nations

00:31:01.549 --> 00:31:04.829
This action could have disrupted the line to the Messiah

00:31:04.829 --> 00:31:08.269
And it definitely threatened to contaminate pure worship

00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:13.630
These men were bringing the restored nation and to disfavor with Jehovah

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:19.470
This is the same reason why Jehovah allowed Babylon to destroy Jerusalem in the first place

00:31:20.829 --> 00:31:24.670
So Nehemiah took action against these faithless ones

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:33.789
Please cleanse this room and replace the utensils

00:31:33.789 --> 00:31:34.349
Yes, men

00:31:34.349 --> 00:31:37.710
And gather all the Levites, the singers, the deputy rulers to me

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:39.470
I'm assigning them all back to their posts

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:42.430
He enforced the strict observance of the Sabbath

00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:44.190
What's the meaning of this?

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:46.589
I had to sleep on a ground last night

00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:48.589
You know God's law

00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:52.430
No work, no business, on the Sabbath

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:53.549
Go

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:57.069
You know the Levites guard the gates and keep the Sabbath home

00:31:58.029 --> 00:32:02.819
Don't let anyone in

00:32:02.819 --> 00:32:05.059
He disciplined those who had taken foreign wives

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:10.500
Did you not swear never to marry someone who doesn't serve Jehovah

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:12.180
Nehemiah, nobody cares

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:15.299
Did you not?

00:32:15.299 --> 00:32:16.259
Yes, yes

00:32:16.259 --> 00:32:20.019
Why have you ignored the command of Jehovah and your own oath?

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:25.779
There's no doubt Jehovah's Guide Nehemiah's efforts all along

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:32.420
After a spiritual cleansing was done, a measure of peace was again enjoyed

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:36.900
And with this vigorous rooting out of apostasy

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:40.900
The record of the Hebrew scriptures comes to a close

00:32:45.089 --> 00:32:49.650
Now we don't have an inspired record of events in the centuries leading up to Jesus' birth

00:32:50.609 --> 00:32:54.930
But history shows that Jerusalem underwent several changes during these years

00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:59.170
The Meadow Persian Empire was overtaken by Greece

00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:03.089
Represented by the copper belly and thighs of Nebuchadnezzus dream image

00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:08.609
While the city seemed to survive the change in control without any physical damage

00:33:09.329 --> 00:33:11.250
Its spiritual state was threatened

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:18.690
The Greek Empire set the stage for the spread of Greek language, culture, and religious thought

00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:22.049
And Israel was affected by this influence

00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:29.329
Years later, King Antiochus IV was determined to eradicate Jewish worship and customs

00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:36.210
He went so far as to sacrifice a peg to the Greek God Zeus at the Temple of Jehovah

00:33:36.849 --> 00:33:41.250
This was a vicious attempt to defile and stamp out pure worship

00:33:41.809 --> 00:33:44.690
However, the desecration had the opposite effect

00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:52.690
It sparked an uprising of zealous Jews and three years later they cleansed the temple and rededicated it to Jehovah

00:33:54.529 --> 00:33:59.809
About a century later, Jerusalem experienced another change in rulership

00:33:59.809 --> 00:34:02.690
As Rome became the dominant world power

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:08.800
Rome corresponded to the legs of iron and Nebuchadnezzus dream image

00:34:10.079 --> 00:34:15.199
Under the rule of Herod the Great, Jerusalem enjoyed considerable prosperity

00:34:15.199 --> 00:34:21.039
Herod's greatest work however was the reconstruction of the temple and its building complex

00:34:21.039 --> 00:34:25.440
The temple and its daily sacrifices remained an operation down to Jesus' day

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:29.039
The Bible record picks up before Jesus was born

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:48.880
Hey Jehovah, mercy on us. What's happening? Is the Son of God already?

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.320
Are they? Are they angels?

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:54.880
Do not be afraid

00:34:54.880 --> 00:35:00.400
For look, I am declaring to you good news of a great joy that all the people will have

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:06.079
For today there was born to you in David City a Savior who is Christ the Lord

00:35:07.519 --> 00:35:10.400
Jesus' birth and ministry fulfilled many prophecies

00:35:11.199 --> 00:35:15.280
In 29 CE Jehovah anointed Jesus with Holy Spirit

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:22.400
This corresponds exactly to the words of Daniel's prophecy that Jehovah gave him more than 500 years earlier

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:25.280
The promised Messiah had arrived

00:35:27.119 --> 00:35:32.000
Early in his ministry, Jesus read these words from the prophecy of Isaiah

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:36.420
The scroll of Isaiah the prophet reads

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:40.179
Jehovah's Spirit is upon me

00:35:41.139 --> 00:35:45.780
Because he anointed me to declare good news to the poor

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:52.340
He sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and a recovery of sight to the blind

00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:57.860
to send the crushed ones away free to preach Jehovah's acceptable year

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:11.519
Today this scripture that you just heard is fulfilled

00:36:18.619 --> 00:36:25.099
Holy Spirit empowered Jesus to perform many miracles in just a few short years on earth

00:36:25.579 --> 00:36:28.699
This had a profound effect on the people living in his day

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:31.900
I'm a very sick woman

00:36:33.579 --> 00:36:37.260
I've suffered from a flow of blood for some 12 years

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:41.340
He can heal me even if I could touch

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:46.860
Just the fringes of his outer garment. I will get well

00:36:58.369 --> 00:37:00.369
Who touched my outer garments?

00:37:00.769 --> 00:37:02.769
Who touched me

00:37:04.849 --> 00:37:08.369
Please forgive me my heart. It was I who touched you

00:37:11.409 --> 00:37:14.400
Faith in you

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:18.559
But if I could just touch the fringes of your outer garment

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:22.639
I could get well

00:37:22.719 --> 00:37:24.719
Take courage daughter

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.880
Your faith has made you well

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:35.389
The miracles Jesus before more like anything the people had seen before

00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:38.190
Finally the people had hope

00:37:38.989 --> 00:37:41.550
A hope for the future a hope for peace

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:47.550
He even demonstrated that he had power far beyond any human ruler

00:37:49.389 --> 00:38:04.449
Lord Mary is here. My brother would not have died

00:38:14.079 --> 00:38:15.519
Lazarus

00:38:15.519 --> 00:38:30.099
Come out

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:37.250
Free him and let him go

00:38:39.469 --> 00:38:44.670
There is so much we can learn from Jesus miracles works and teachings

00:38:45.469 --> 00:38:48.269
They reveal Jehovah's purpose and power

00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:54.750
They show how enjoyable how peaceful life will be under God's Messianic ruler

00:38:55.789 --> 00:38:58.909
Humans alive at this time could see visible proof of this

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:04.670
Jesus ministry accomplished so much in just three and a half years

00:39:05.309 --> 00:39:08.670
And prophecy regarding the Messiah continued to be fulfilled

00:39:09.309 --> 00:39:12.750
As his opposers succeeded in putting him to death

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:28.099
With the sacrifice of Jesus perfect human life

00:39:28.659 --> 00:39:32.420
The entire arrangement for worshiping Jehovah had changed

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:35.940
There was no longer a need for animal sacrifices

00:39:36.579 --> 00:39:40.179
Pure worship was no longer centered around the temple in Jerusalem

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:43.300
The only way to worship Jehovah

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:45.300
Acceptably was through the Messiah

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:52.659
Now people everywhere could find the way to peace through faith in Jesus ransom sacrifice

00:39:54.659 --> 00:39:57.780
The Jewish system of worship under the mosaic law was over

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:01.300
Jerusalem in the temple no longer had Jehovah's favor

00:40:02.099 --> 00:40:06.900
Jesus perfect human sacrifice was the only solution for lasting peace

00:40:07.619 --> 00:40:11.139
So what did this mean for the city of Jerusalem and the temple

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:14.820
Well before his death

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:19.059
Jesus provided his followers with a warning regarding Jerusalem's destruction

00:40:19.699 --> 00:40:22.500
In Luke 21 2021 he says

00:40:23.219 --> 00:40:26.739
When you see Jerusalem surrounded by encamped armies

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:30.260
Then know that the desolating of her has drawn near

00:40:31.139 --> 00:40:36.420
Let those in the midst of her leave and let those in the countryside not enter into her

00:40:37.219 --> 00:40:39.219
A good ruler guides his people

00:40:40.099 --> 00:40:44.019
Although it wasn't yet time for him to take the throne as ruler of God's kingdom

00:40:44.019 --> 00:40:48.739
Jesus by the way he acted gave us insight into the kind of ruler he would be

00:40:49.219 --> 00:40:56.820
By providing first-century Christians with a warning to leave Jerusalem and all Judea

00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:59.219
He was guiding them and protecting them

00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:06.500
Jesus prophesied the destruction of the city and just a few decades later that prophecy came true

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:13.380
The Roman Empire still had control of Judea and tensions ran high between the Romans and the Jews

00:41:14.659 --> 00:41:17.619
Eventually the Jews revolted against Roman rule

00:41:18.179 --> 00:41:35.969
With the city surrounded and Roman forces closing in it seemed there was no way out

00:41:36.929 --> 00:41:40.130
But Jehovah's word cannot go unfulfilled

00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:43.969
For no apparent reason the Roman forces withdrew

00:41:48.619 --> 00:41:51.820
For faithful Christians this was their opportunity

00:41:53.739 --> 00:41:55.340
It's simple

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:59.659
Those who followed Jesus' direction to leave Judea were guided to safety

00:42:00.539 --> 00:42:05.179
For those who delayed escape became difficult or impossible

00:42:14.179 --> 00:42:19.059
There was no doubt Jerusalem no longer enjoyed Jehovah's special favor in protection

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:29.739
The city and its temple were completely destroyed

00:42:41.219 --> 00:42:46.500
There are parallels we can draw from the warning Jesus gave to those first-century Christians

00:42:47.139 --> 00:42:49.380
To the warning we have been given for our day

00:42:50.019 --> 00:42:56.900
Jesus gave us one composite sign that indicates the destruction of this current system of things is very close

00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:03.219
prophecies in the Bible give us no doubt we are living in the last days

00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:07.780
Jehovah has not revealed all the details of how everything will work out

00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:11.860
But we know that everything he has revealed will come true

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:17.300
This includes details outlining how world events would unfold in the time of the end

00:43:17.699 --> 00:43:20.900
Before mankind would experience permanent peace

00:43:21.619 --> 00:43:29.940
Remember Daniel's prophecy indicated that there would be only one dominant world power in place at the time of the end

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:35.300
By world war one the power represented by the feet of iron and clay had emerged

00:43:35.699 --> 00:43:44.260
During that war Britain and America forged a partnership that continued through the second world war

00:43:47.010 --> 00:43:54.210
This means a special relationship between the British Commonwealth and Empire and the United States of America

00:43:55.329 --> 00:44:01.889
Neither the sure prevention of war nor the continuous rise of world organization

00:44:02.610 --> 00:44:09.489
We'll begin without what I have called the fraternal association of the English-speaking people

00:44:16.159 --> 00:44:20.639
These two countries continue to be a dual English-speaking world power

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:26.239
The characteristics of iron and clay used to represent this world power are significant

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:32.239
And as the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay

00:44:33.199 --> 00:44:37.440
So the kingdom will be partly strong and partly fragile

00:44:42.269 --> 00:44:48.750
At times the United States and Britain have displayed iron-like strength through their involvement in armed conflicts

00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:55.150
However iron mixed with clay is considerably weakened

00:44:55.710 --> 00:45:02.909
This can be observed as common people undermine the Anglo-American world powers ability to act with iron-like strength

00:45:03.869 --> 00:45:09.949
As the political and social developments foretold in the Bible come to a climax

00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:12.750
We have a measure of peace

00:45:13.070 --> 00:45:19.630
We know Jehovah will guide his people even as the world's spiritual and moral conditions sinks to new depths

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:27.219
As many in the first century Jerusalem continued their lives as if nothing had changed

00:45:28.179 --> 00:45:30.019
So too today

00:45:30.019 --> 00:45:32.019
Many continue on with their lives

00:45:32.659 --> 00:45:38.500
Meanwhile we remain alert as we see fulfillment of Bible prophecy right before our eyes

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:42.900
In the days of those kings

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:48.179
The god of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed

00:45:50.019 --> 00:45:52.739
The book of Revelation tells us what will soon happen

00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:59.139
The political rulers of the world will give the United Nations unprecedented power and authority

00:46:00.099 --> 00:46:04.900
The Apostle Paul foretold that the nations will declare peace and security

00:46:06.019 --> 00:46:08.019
But it won't prove to be true peace

00:46:11.489 --> 00:46:15.570
The nation supporting the UN will attack the institutions of false religion

00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:32.159
Then a coalition of earth governments that the prophet Ezekiel calls god of the land of may god will attack God's people

00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:35.280
Yet we don't need to be fearful

00:46:36.239 --> 00:46:40.239
That's when we can put into action all of the lessons we've learned

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:46.400
Those who trust and obey Jehovah's guidance can look to the near future with confidence

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:48.159
As we've seen

00:46:48.159 --> 00:46:51.440
Jehovah has always been in control of the situation

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:56.639
He has never guided his people in a certain direction then failed to provide for them

00:46:57.199 --> 00:47:03.840
That's why we can say that the lessons we learn from the faithful men we've studied are more than just lessons

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:08.639
This has been Jehovah paving the way for peace from the start

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:10.639
Looking back

00:47:10.639 --> 00:47:15.280
We see exactly how Jehovah has led his people it took many years

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:17.519
But he's been in control the whole time

00:47:18.239 --> 00:47:21.440
Would it make sense to think he isn't in control anymore?

00:47:22.079 --> 00:47:28.480
No power in heaven or on earth can prevent Jehovah from accomplishing his express purpose

00:47:29.039 --> 00:47:34.000
He has never relinquished control and he is still guiding his people

00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:36.800
Now think about this

00:47:37.039 --> 00:47:40.480
If Jehovah has guided his people to this point

00:47:41.199 --> 00:47:48.480
We can have full confidence that trust and obedience to his direction will prove to be our salvation

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:52.480
Even if a way out seems impossible

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:55.920
Jehovah is all powerful

00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:00.559
He's going to help us through whatever we may face

00:48:05.019 --> 00:48:16.750
We won't have to fight and we won't need to fear annihilation

00:48:17.789 --> 00:48:20.269
Jehovah has things under control

00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:27.329
Will not be passed on to any other people

00:48:30.099 --> 00:48:53.300
It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms and it alone will stand forever

00:48:54.579 --> 00:48:57.860
God's kingdom will fill and renew the entire earth

00:49:03.059 --> 00:49:05.780
Jehovah's promises will become completely fulfilled

00:49:08.079 --> 00:49:13.440
Lasting peace will finally become a reality for all mankind

00:49:14.079 --> 00:49:20.079
Just imagine what faithful servants have to look forward to under Jesus' heavenly rule

00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:24.559
He will be able to provide what no man ever could

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.400
Can you imagine what that will be like?

00:49:49.809 --> 00:49:51.329
For look

00:49:51.409 --> 00:49:54.050
I am creating new heavens and a new earth

00:49:54.769 --> 00:49:57.250
And the former things will not be called to mind

00:50:01.039 --> 00:50:03.039
Nor will they come up into the heart

00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:09.820
The righteous will possess the earth

00:50:12.179 --> 00:50:13.780
And they will live forever on it

00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:38.579
He will swallow up death forever

00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:45.550
And the sovereign Lord Jehovah will wipe away the tears from all faces

00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:58.179
He will wipe out every tear from their eyes

00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:00.260
And death will be no more

00:51:01.219 --> 00:51:06.980
Neither will morning nor outcry nor pain be anymore

00:51:08.659 --> 00:51:10.579
The former things have passed away

00:51:11.139 --> 00:51:42.610
At that time the eyes of the blind will be open

00:51:43.650 --> 00:51:47.170
And the ears of the deaf will be unstopped

00:51:53.579 --> 00:51:56.860
At that time the lame will leap like the deer

00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:03.980
And the tongue of the speechless will shout for joy

00:52:04.539 --> 00:52:11.860
For waters will burst forth in the wilderness

00:52:16.130 --> 00:52:18.369
And streams in the desert plain

00:52:25.809 --> 00:52:28.050
They will build houses and live in them

00:52:37.869 --> 00:52:40.349
And they will plant vineyards and eat their fruities

00:52:52.610 --> 00:52:56.130
For the days of my people will be like the days of a tree

00:52:57.889 --> 00:52:59.409
And the work of their hands

00:53:01.170 --> 00:53:03.329
My chosen ones will enjoy to the fool

00:53:07.489 --> 00:53:09.809
But the meek will possess the earth

00:53:14.289 --> 00:53:16.530
And they will find exquisite delight

00:53:17.090 --> 00:53:19.329
In the abundance of peace

00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:36.619
What a faith strengthening drama

00:53:37.579 --> 00:53:41.340
We are at peace knowing that Jehovah is in complete control

00:53:43.179 --> 00:53:46.460
All in attendance will be pleased to know that parts one and two

00:53:47.019 --> 00:53:49.019
Of the drama documentary

00:53:49.019 --> 00:53:51.099
Jehovah guides us in the way of peace

00:54:01.570 --> 00:54:05.250
Have you enjoyed the original songs that have been featured at recent conventions

00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:09.889
We now have the privilege of watching a video medley

00:54:10.449 --> 00:54:14.929
And reflecting on the lessons we have learned at our conventions over the past few years

00:54:16.289 --> 00:54:46.260
Enjoy

00:59:50.530 --> 01:00:03.219
The life should have my song

01:00:03.219 --> 01:00:13.250
I was with pain

01:00:13.969 --> 01:01:18.510
This is real

01:01:18.510 --> 01:04:34.619
Our next song encourages us to look ahead with confidence

01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:37.340
The song is entitled

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:39.659
See yourself when all is new

01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:42.860
Let's sing together song number 139

01:04:43.659 --> 01:04:45.659
That song number 139
