00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:06.589
Some years ago, the watchtower quoted a religion writer who said,

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:10.589
we no longer see ourselves as sinners in need of forgiveness.

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:15.589
Maybe sin used to be a problem, but now we've outgrown that.

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:19.589
So while the church has a solution for the problem of sin,

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:24.589
it's a non-problem in the eyes of most Americans.

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:28.589
Now that statement was made about 25 years ago,

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:34.590
and today, many more people around the world share that view.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.590
What is sin? How is it related to freedom?

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.590
And why is it still a problem, even for us as Christians?

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:48.590
In his letter to the Romans, the Apostle Paul discusses the power of sin

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.590
and how we can control it.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.590
The Bible says that all unrighteousness is sin,

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.590
and that includes anything that disturbs our relationship with Jehovah.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.590
Paul explains in Romans 5 and 12 that through one man Adam,

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.590
sin entered into the world and death through sin,

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.590
and so death spread to all men because they had all sinned.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.590
Then he adds in chapter 7,

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.590
for I do not do the good that I wish,

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.590
but the bad that I do not wish is what I practice.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:33.590
And if we're honest, all of us have to admit that the same has been true for us.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.590
Sin is not just what we do or what we don't do.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.590
The inside book explains that it is also a governing principle

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.590
or force that operates inside of us.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.590
And that's a scary thought when you think about it.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:00.590
Paul describes in his letter sin as a law that is trying to control our actions.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:08.590
He calls it a king that gives orders in different ways to different persons at different times.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:15.590
And these vivid analogies that Paul uses are intended to help us understand just how powerful,

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.590
how relentless inherited sin really is.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.590
That power quickly became evident after Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:34.590
In Genesis 4, when Jehovah accepted Abel's sacrifice but rejected Keynes,

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.590
the Bible tells us that Keynes became very angry and dejected.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.590
Now, Keynes didn't realize that the intense feelings he was experiencing

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.590
were not merely the natural human emotions he was created with.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:58.590
It was the sin that he inherited from his parents that was trying to control him.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.590
So Jehovah immediately explained this to Keynes.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.590
He warned him of the potential consequences.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:13.590
He said, sin is crouching at the door, Keynes, and its craving is to dominate you.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.590
But will you get the mastery over it?

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:26.590
Sadly, as we know, Keynes did not listen to Jehovah and he allowed that sin to get control or mastery over him.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.590
And eventually, he killed his own brother.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.590
To set a John 8 and 34, that every doer of sin is a slave of sin.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.590
There's no escaping that.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.590
We don't outgrow this problem of sin as we get older.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.590
And we're foolish to simply ignore it.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.590
Sin is the worst kind of slavery that humans have experienced.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.590
Not only can it mislead us into doing what's bad,

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.590
but it can also prevent us from doing what we know to be right

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:07.590
or from living up to what we know we're capable of in God's sight.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.590
That brings to our mind Paul's painful admission at Romans 7.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.589
You know it well, but please turn in your Bibles with me there now.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:23.589
And let's read his familiar words together again there in verses 21 through 24.

00:04:23.589 --> 00:04:33.589
Who of us does not identify with the daily struggle that Paul describes here, verse 21?

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:42.589
I find then this law in my case, when I wish to do what is right, what is bad is present with me.

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:47.589
I really delight in the law of God according to the man I am within.

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:52.589
But I see in my body another law warring against the law of my mind

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:57.589
and leading me captive to sin's law that is in my body.

00:04:57.589 --> 00:05:04.589
Miserable man that I am, who will rescue me from the body undergoing this death?

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:12.259
By the time that Paul wrote this letter, he had been in the truth for over 20 years.

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:17.259
He served as an apostle to the nations for almost 10 of those years

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:25.259
and yet sin was still crouching at his door. It was still trying to dominate him.

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:29.259
What weaknesses did Paul have to overcome?

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:38.259
Well, we don't know for sure, but he did write to Timothy once that he had formerly been an insolent man.

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:46.259
And before his conversion, he said he was extremely mad at the Christians and persecuted them.

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:51.259
Obviously, Paul learned to control his temper after becoming a Christian,

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:58.259
but there were still times when he struggled to control his feelings and his words.

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:06.259
On one occasion, the Bible says there was a sharp burst of anger between him and his close companion, Barnabas.

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:14.259
As Paul says, on our own, we are helpless to control the sin inside of us.

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:18.259
And yet, the situation is not hopeless.

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:26.259
Jesus promised that John 8 and 36, if the sun sets you free, you will be truly free.

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:30.259
Let's keep reading in verse 25 of Romans 7.

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:37.259
Paul concludes by saying, thanks to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:47.259
So then with my mind I am, I myself am a slave to God's law, but with my flesh to sin's law.

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:58.259
Because he accepted Jehovah's arrangement for salvation, Paul was set free from slavery to King Sin and his sidekick death.

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:06.259
What a release that was for Paul. You can almost hear the sigh of relief in those words.

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:11.259
Well, what sinful tendencies are you fighting right now, brothers and sisters?

00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:16.259
Is it envy like cane or perhaps your temper like Paul?

00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:22.259
Or is there some other bad attitude or habit that you just can't seem to kick?

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:28.259
Well, don't be discouraged. Like Paul, we all have our battle with sin.

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:32.259
The solution to the problem of sin is this.

00:07:32.259 --> 00:07:39.259
Put faith in the ransom and do your best to keep walking by spirit.

00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:44.259
The ransom makes it possible for us to serve Jehovah God with a clean conscience.

00:07:44.259 --> 00:07:47.259
What a gift that is.

00:07:47.259 --> 00:07:59.259
And Romans 8 and 2 Paul says, for the law of the spirit that gives life in union with Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death.

00:07:59.259 --> 00:08:02.259
What does it mean to walk in God's spirit?

00:08:02.259 --> 00:08:06.259
Well, it means making steady spiritual advancement.

00:08:06.259 --> 00:08:13.259
It does not mean striving for spiritual perfection, which is something we can't do right now.

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:23.259
Day by day, to the best of our ability, we try to walk or live our life in accord with the leadings of God's Holy Spirit.

00:08:24.259 --> 00:08:32.259
Sin is real. It's serious. It's not just a made up concept to keep our behavior in check.

00:08:32.259 --> 00:08:37.259
And it includes anything that disturbs our relationship with God.

00:08:37.259 --> 00:08:49.259
We all start out life as a slave of sin. But with Jehovah's help, Paul says we can get free from its control and keep sin from gaining the upper hand.

00:08:50.259 --> 00:09:02.259
It's a real privilege, brothers and sisters, to be serving alongside men and women like you who are fighting that battle successfully every day.

00:09:02.259 --> 00:09:11.259
Please keep up the fight. If possible, keep doing it more fully. We can do this. Let's do it together.

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:18.259
By the end of Christ's thousand-year reign, Jesus will vanquish King Sin once and for all time.

00:09:18.259 --> 00:09:24.259
What a joy that will be. We will then enjoy what Romans 8 and 21 says,

00:09:24.259 --> 00:09:33.259
the glorious freedom of the sons of God. Imagine. We'll never again have to ask Jehovah for forgiveness of our sins.

00:09:33.259 --> 00:09:42.259
We'll be able to say to Jehovah every day like Jesus does, I always do the things pleasing to you.

00:09:42.259 --> 00:09:51.259
What an incredible experience that will be. I can't wait. That's the way to true freedom.
