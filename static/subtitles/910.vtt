In the parable of the virgins, the brideroom is Jesus and the virgins are his anointed followers.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.690
Jesus gave this parable to admonish all his anointed followers in the last days

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:33.539
to keep on the watch, lest they miss out on their precious reward.

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:42.619
In the parable of the talons, the master is Jesus and his slaves are his anointed followers.

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:47.460
Before Jesus ascended to heaven, he entrusted them with talons,

00:00:47.460 --> 00:01:00.590
that is, the responsibility to preach and make disciples.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.909
In the parable of the sheep and the goats, the shepherd is Jesus.

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.909
And the sheep are Christians who have the hope of living forever on earth.

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.709
Those Christians are judged to be sheep because they support the anointed.
