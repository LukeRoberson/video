00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.169
What would you say?

00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:07.209
How important is the disciple-making work?

00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:12.609
Well, it is so important that Jehovah God is directly involved in it.

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:14.210
How do we know?

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.050
Turn in your Bibles, please, to 1 Corinthians chapter 3, verse 9.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.010
1 Corinthians 3, 9.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.809
It says, for we are God's fellow-workers.

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:31.410
You are God's field under cultivation, God's building.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.090
Let's think what a privilege we have to share with the Almighty Creator of the universe

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.969
and work that he considers so important here on Earth.

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:47.969
He allows us to experience the joy of helping to build people into disciples of Jesus Christ.

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.450
We know from the verses that come just before verse 9 that while we plant and water seeds

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:59.170
of kingdom truth in the hearts of interested ones, Jehovah is the one who makes those seeds

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.170
grow.

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:05.730
However, knowing this should not minimize in our minds the importance of our part in

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.010
the disciple-making work.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.769
What we do and how we do it has an impact on how those seeds of truth will grow.

00:01:14.769 --> 00:01:19.450
And Jehovah knows that the more skilled we become at making disciples, the more effective

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.290
we will be as his fellow-workers, and the more enjoyable the work will be for us.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.489
To that end, Jehovah equips us to teach as effectively as possible.

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:36.170
All we have to do is accept his help, and that is what this symposium is all about.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.409
Learning to benefit from the research tools Jehovah has given us, the help that is available

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.370
from our brothers and the power of prayer.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.569
Each talk in this symposium will consider two questions.

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:53.010
First, what help has Jehovah given us?

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:59.810
In second, how can we use that help to increase our joy in the ministry?

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.409
Let's start by talking about research tools, what help has Jehovah given us?

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.569
He has given us the right tools, the best tools for our work.

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:16.409
For most of all, he has dignified us by allowing us to use his written word the Bible, and

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:20.729
that is our most important tool for the ministry.

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:30.770
According to 2 Timothy 3, verses 16 and 17, 2 Timothy 3, 16 and 17, it says all Scripture

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:38.569
is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight,

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:44.729
for disciplining and righteousness, so that the man of God or woman of God may be fully

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:50.979
competent, completely equipped for every good work.

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:55.860
We should want to do all we can to keep honing our skills in using the Bible to teach the

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.020
truth about God, Christ and the kingdom.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:07.979
The beauty of using the Bible is that the message contained in it can literally change people.

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:11.939
Religious falsehoods and erroneous ideas have become strongly entrenched in the minds

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:20.099
of sincere people, but the Bible, when used effectively, can overturn those wrong beliefs.

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:25.580
By the Bible can even help a person understand his own deepest thoughts and feelings.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:33.180
One Bible translation renders that 16th verse by saying the Bible is useful for resetting

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.819
the direction of a man's life.

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.379
Through our own study of the Bible, we can become skilled at using the Scriptures in the

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:42.900
ministry.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.580
And to help us succeed in this, Jehovah has given us a variety of research tools to use

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.860
in personal study and family worship.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:58.860
These include the Watchtower Library, the JW Library App, the Watchtower Online Library,

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.060
and the Research Guide.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.020
Jehovah wants us to be skillful in using the tools he has provided, so that the proverb

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:13.020
will come true for us that says, have you seen a man skillful at his work?

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.939
He will stand before kings.

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:22.060
As you watch the following dramatization, notice what comes up on Nita's Bible study

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:28.899
that challenges her as a teacher, how she realizes she needs help to teach effectively,

00:04:28.899 --> 00:04:36.550
and what research tool she uses to prepare for her study with Jade.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.550
Making a friend with God?

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.149
Yeah, I don't know how to do that.

00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:47.269
Make a friend, but you've done fine with me, but I can see you.

00:04:47.269 --> 00:04:48.269
But God?

00:04:48.269 --> 00:04:49.269
A friend?

00:04:49.269 --> 00:04:50.269
Seriously?

00:04:50.269 --> 00:04:52.470
How about what you can see?

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.829
What does creation teach us about him?

00:04:54.829 --> 00:04:57.949
Hmm, not much.

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:01.189
Maybe evolve or your species dies?

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:02.589
It doesn't really help.

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:06.589
Well, I'm not talking about evolution.

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:10.430
I'm talking about the things that God created.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.230
You don't suppose he's got a little workshop up there building things one at a time, do

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.470
you?

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.910
In the real world, things evolve.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:19.910
It's all random.

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.629
I don't know what that tells me about him.

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:26.029
I wasn't ready for this.

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:28.790
Evolution isn't my strong suit.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:42.060
I need help.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.339
This could be good.

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:53.620
Many who believe evolution, ancient tidal pool, chemicals spontaneously ascend, too deep.

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:59.060
Wait, maybe what does the evidence reveal?

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:08.939
For a cell to survive DNA, RNA, inanimate chemicals, probability, I'm not sure this is

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:10.980
what she needs.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.980
Her real issue was getting to know someone she can't see.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:24.860
Maybe that's the best place to begin.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:34.500
One widespread false teaching, Rob's people of ho, implies that human life has no purpose.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:41.860
This could be it, establish the positive, what creation really says about Jehovah, versus

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.139
whatever evolution obscures.

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:51.740
Okay, so you got me thinking, and I did some research, and I think you really like what

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:52.740
I found.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:53.740
Okay.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.579
Come, come, sit down.

00:06:55.579 --> 00:07:13.120
Okay.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.920
Did you see where need a turn for help?

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.720
The research guide.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:22.279
With a little bit of searching in persistence, she found what she needed.

00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:29.610
She got excited about the information, and passed that excitement on to her student.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.250
How can you use our research tools effectively?

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:37.769
You can use them to help you explain and teach the scriptures.

00:07:37.769 --> 00:07:42.129
For example, as with Jade, your students may be struggling to understand a scriptural

00:07:42.129 --> 00:07:47.569
teaching, or you may have a student who is trying to overcome a personal problem.

00:07:47.569 --> 00:07:53.529
Use the tools Jehovah has given us to search for an explanation or an illustration that

00:07:53.529 --> 00:07:55.730
will help the person.

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:59.050
And you may not even have to do all the work yourself.

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:04.170
Perhaps you can show your students how to use our tools in order to find the Bible's answers

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:07.329
to their questions.

00:08:07.329 --> 00:08:12.329
Do your best, though, to learn how to use our research tools.

00:08:12.329 --> 00:08:18.329
Likely, you already use JW Library for personal study and family worship, and to prepare

00:08:18.329 --> 00:08:20.329
for congregation meetings.

00:08:20.329 --> 00:08:26.129
But if you keep up to date with new features in the JW Library app, you can also use it

00:08:26.129 --> 00:08:29.810
to good advantage in your ministry.

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:34.570
There are even features built into the app that make it possible for you to save the

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:39.730
research that you have done so you can use it again in the future.

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:41.929
What are those features?

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:44.850
Notes and tags.

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:46.970
Notes and tags.

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:50.649
If you learn how to use them, well, now you can.

00:08:50.649 --> 00:08:58.250
If you have JW Library with you on a device, open the Bible to 1 Timothy chapter 2, 1 Timothy

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:05.320
chapter 2, and follow along with this tutorial video.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:09.559
Are you making full use of JW Library?

00:09:09.559 --> 00:09:13.600
Let's learn how some are using it and then practice together.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.200
I create notes in my Bible for many different reasons.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.679
It could be a good point for me to talk, and illustration to help me explain something

00:09:21.679 --> 00:09:26.480
to a Bible student, or something for my own meditation.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.519
I highlight the key phrase and create a note.

00:09:30.519 --> 00:09:32.480
Let's practice together.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:39.600
If you have JW Library, find 1 Timothy 2 verse 6 in the Bible.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:49.500
Now highlight the word ransom and tap the add a note button.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:55.340
Then type your comment.

00:09:55.340 --> 00:10:00.460
Tapping the note marker in the margin brings your comment into view.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:02.860
I've created a lot of notes.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:05.659
I use tags to help me find them again.

00:10:05.659 --> 00:10:11.379
For example, whenever I hear a point that I want to use in the ministry, I create a note

00:10:11.379 --> 00:10:17.340
and add a tag, like prayer, ransom, or last days.

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:21.740
Then when I'm in the ministry, I can quickly find my note.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.179
Let's practice together.

00:10:24.179 --> 00:10:33.169
On the note you just created, tap the three dots, and then edit.

00:10:33.169 --> 00:10:41.190
Now tap the button, add a tag, and enter a tag name.

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:47.710
In this case, type ransom.

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:53.889
You can add as many tags as you like.

00:10:53.889 --> 00:10:59.809
To find your notes again, go to the personal study tab.

00:10:59.809 --> 00:11:05.090
You can type in the search box, or you can just tap the tag.

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:09.450
As I read the Bible chapters for the midweek meeting, I often come across verses that I

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:13.250
want to understand better, so I check the research guide.

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:17.289
Sometimes I use the points I find in a comment at the meeting.

00:11:17.289 --> 00:11:19.570
Let's practice together.

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:23.889
Are you still at first Timothy chapter 2?

00:11:23.889 --> 00:11:28.870
Tap on the number for verse 6.

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:34.179
Then tap the research guide button on the menu.

00:11:34.179 --> 00:11:39.100
Now you can read information that explains this verse.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:48.090
You can even copy a portion of the research and paste it into your notes.

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:53.129
If you were like me, you will probably have to watch that video a few more times.

00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:56.649
If you find it challenging to learn how to use some of the features of our tools, here

00:11:56.649 --> 00:11:58.289
are two things you can do.

00:11:58.289 --> 00:12:04.129
First, ask someone in your congregation to assist you, and often the young people can

00:12:04.129 --> 00:12:05.929
help the most.

00:12:05.929 --> 00:12:13.429
Second, go to jw.org, scroll to the bottom of any page, click on jw library, and click

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:20.740
and there you will find more tutorial videos that you can watch.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:26.179
As announced at the 2018 annual meeting, our research tools are being redesigned to be

00:12:26.179 --> 00:12:29.019
unified and more user friendly.

00:12:29.019 --> 00:12:32.779
Be sure to learn the new features as they are released.

00:12:32.779 --> 00:12:38.860
And may you joyfully work with Jehovah by using the research tools he has provided for

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:42.059
making disciples.

00:12:42.059 --> 00:12:46.259
Brother Joel Dalinger, a helper to the service committee will now present the next talk of

00:12:46.259 --> 00:12:53.500
the symposium, experience the joy of disciples making, accept Jehovah's help, our brothers.
