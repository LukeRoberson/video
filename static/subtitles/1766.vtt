00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:14.689
Since I was a boy, whenever I saw a blank piece of paper, I felt like drawing something.

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:22.809
I was born in 1925 in Lilahammer, Norway.

00:00:22.809 --> 00:00:25.250
My father received a brochure.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:31.850
He was not that religious, but after reading it he started preaching straight away.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.329
Our families and neighbors didn't like it at all.

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.429
But I listened to him because he spoke about a paradise earth.

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:51.030
I found my father's bag and thought to myself, now it's time for me to try.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.070
I also started telling my classmates about it.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.549
They all decided to make fun of me, but one of them changed his attitude.

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:10.030
He listened.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.349
After the war, it was possible for both of us to travel by train to Oslo to get back

00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:21.819
and toast.

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:34.620
Later on I returned to Oslo to attend an art school.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.099
At the same time I attended all the meetings.

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:42.099
There I met a former full-time minister and he said to me,

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:48.019
the happiest time of my life was when I was in the traveling work visiting the brothers.

00:01:48.019 --> 00:01:53.939
It got me thinking, maybe that could be me one day.

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:05.599
I got a lot of work as a painter in my hometown and gradually I became known as an artist.

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:08.199
But it took too much of my time.

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:14.000
I knew Matthew 24-14 that the kingdom should be preached.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.039
And I thought, I need to do my part.

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:20.479
I can't just stand by and let others do the work.

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:33.740
So I decided to start pioneering.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:42.379
Now I've been in the full-time ministry for about 70 years.

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.659
My life has been meaningful.

00:02:45.659 --> 00:03:14.259
I have many good friends in a peace and joy.

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:16.620
At a convention I met Aydit.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:51.979
She's always been encouraging, actually very encouraging.

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:58.900
After doing traveling work for several years, I wanted to return to Lila Hama to Pioneer

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.740
and see if I could be of any use there.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:09.090
And I found more than enough work to do.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.129
I still paint occasion.

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:16.740
Sometimes you get these ideas you really want to put on the canvas.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.060
I look forward to a paradise serve.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:26.100
With peaceful, smiling people who are joyful and happy.
