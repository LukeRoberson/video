00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.500
It was made in secret, hidden in the lining of a jacket,

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.500
and then smuggled out of the country.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.500
What was it?

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.500
A recording of brothers and sisters in Siberia singing

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.500
kingdom songs.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.500
They sent it from one side of the earth to the other

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.500
to be played at the 1958 International Convention

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.500
in New York for an audience of more than 250,000 people.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.500
Why is singing so important to Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.500
Let's find out in this episode of our history in motion.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:58.659
Jehovah's worshipers have long praised him with song,

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:03.659
but how did singing become a part of our modern day worship?

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:08.659
The story begins more than 150 years ago.

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.659
The year is about 1869 in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, USA.

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.659
Charles Tay's Russell is a young man searching for scriptural truth.

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.659
One evening, he's walking along and hears something,

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.659
singing coming from a religious meeting being held in a basement.

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.659
He goes in and what he hears sparks a fire for Bible study

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.659
like never before.

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.659
Later, Russell and his associates make music's role in

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.659
pure worship clear as they rediscover Bible truth.

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.659
Charles Tay's Russell may have come to appreciate the power

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.659
of music to stir emotions from a music business his father

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.659
owned for a period of time.

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.659
He believed that the singing of the truth is a good way to get it

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.659
into the heads and hearts of God's people.

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:15.659
The first issue of Zion's Watchtower, published in July of 1879,

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:20.659
announced a song book, The First of Many to Come.

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.659
It was called Songs of the Bride.

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:29.659
It contained 144 hymns or religious songs of praise.

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:33.659
The Bible students sang at their meetings and assemblies.

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:38.659
What was it like to sing these songs back in the early 1900s?

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:43.659
Imagine you're at one of Charles Tay's Russell's lectures.

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:47.659
As you walk in, you're handed a small sheet of paper.

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:50.659
You look for a seat, but it's packed.

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.659
As the crowd quiets down, they announce that the meeting

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:57.659
will start with the song and prayer.

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:01.659
In a church you expect to find a hymn book in your pew,

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:03.659
but this is a rented hall.

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:08.659
Then you realize that the paper you were handed has the song lyrics,

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:12.659
and it also has a place to leave your name and address

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.659
if you'd like a Bible study.

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:19.659
So when the audience starts to sing, you join in.

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:23.659
What did songs sound like back then?

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:28.659
Let's listen to a song we sang for over eight decades.

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:32.659
Here's a recording from 1916.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.560
That's a little different than how our songs sound today.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.560
Compare different versions of this song,

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.560
and you'll notice the lyrics and theme changed over the years.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:04:08.759
Here's a version of All Hail by the Watchtower male quartet in 1935.

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:11.759
In our first song book, the song was called All Hail,

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:15.759
the Power of Jesus Name, which was about, well,

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:20.759
the Power of Jesus Name was zero mention of Jehovah.

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:26.759
You see, many songs prior to this were adapted from existing church hymns.

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:30.759
Now here's the same song in 1950.

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:34.759
Instead of the lyrics over emphasizing Jesus' name,

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:41.759
the lyrics refer to making known God's will and mentions Jehovah by name.

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:49.620
Why all the changes?

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.620
Because our songs reflect our current understanding of scriptural truth.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.620
As the light gets brighter, we understand the truth more clearly,

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.620
so the songs change.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:10.620
Our first song book explained the goal to publish songs free from objectionable theology,

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.620
and it's been the case ever since.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.620
We don't hold on to songs for tradition or nostalgia.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.620
We sing it because it's the truth.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.620
From the 1928 song book onward, there was a big shift.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.620
Many songs were written by our brothers and sisters.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:39.620
They put more emphasis on Jehovah's name, attributes, and kingdom.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.620
You can even tell by the title, Songs of Praise to Jehovah.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.620
Some of the songs might even sound familiar, like this one.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:06:04.980
Are your parents in the truth, your grandparents,

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.980
even your great-grandparents?

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:13.980
If so, they sang the same song as you at their meetings and assemblies.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.980
That's a real legacy.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.980
Let's fast forward to the 1940s.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.980
Some of our brothers were in prison for their faith.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.980
The world was at war and needed good news.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.980
So we intensified our preaching and teaching work.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.980
This is when the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead and Theocratic Ministry School started,

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:41.980
and it's also when singing was reintroduced at our meetings.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.230
Wait a minute.

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:46.230
Reintroduced?

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:50.230
That means we stop singing at meetings.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.230
When?

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:57.230
Find out in the next episode of our History in Motion.
