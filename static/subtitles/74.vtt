00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.099
Welcome to JW Broadcasting.

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:11.099
This month we will discuss how to meet the challenge of bearing thorough witness.

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.099
Is your territory difficult to reach?

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.100
Do language and cultural differences make you apprehensive?

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.100
That's what these publishers faced when they moved to where the need is greater.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.100
We'll learn how they stepped up to the challenge.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:33.100
This sister embraced the truth during a time of violent division in Northern Ireland.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.100
How does she muster the courage to preach to everyone in her community?

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.100
We'll see how Jehovah helped her.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.100
All this and more on JW Broadcasting.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:01:08.450
Imagine the astonished look on the faces of the apostles.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.450
The resurrected Jesus stands before them on the Mount of Olives.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.450
Just before he disappears into the clouds,

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:23.450
Jesus makes this profound declaration as recorded at Acts 1-8.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.450
You will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you,

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.450
and you will be witnesses of me in Jerusalem, in Al-Judiya and Samaria,

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.450
and to the most distant part of the earth.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.450
What an assignment!

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.450
They were to preach the good news of God's kingdom throughout the earth.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.450
Those disciples must have felt overwhelmed,

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.450
and wondered how such a small band of preachers could ever get this work done.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:01.450
Ten days later, they received the promised Holy Spirit, and they got to work.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.450
True, they faced many challenges, but that did not stop them.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.449
Three years passed, and the preaching work was expanded to include Gentiles.

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:17.449
We can read the moving account in Acts chapter 10.

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:23.449
First, an angel of God appears to the God-fearing army officer Cornelius.

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:29.449
Then Peter responds to the leadings of God's Spirit to go to the officer's home.

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:33.449
There, Peter gives a thorough witness about Jesus,

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:38.449
not only to Cornelius, but also to his family and friends.

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:46.449
As he concludes his discourse, Peter explains the commission he received to be an evangelizer.

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:55.449
Let's open to Acts 10.42, and note the two main aspects of the preaching work started by Jesus.

00:02:55.449 --> 00:03:02.449
Also, he ordered us to preach to the people, and to give a thorough witness

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:08.449
that this is the one decreed by God to be judge of the living and the dead.

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:13.449
First, Jesus commanded his disciples to preach to the people.

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:17.449
In addition, they were to give a thorough witness.

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:22.449
The disciples were to search out honest-hearted deserving ones.

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:27.449
That would require a thorough coverage of their territory.

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:36.449
In spite of vicious persecution, Christians in the first century obeyed Jesus' command to preach and to bear thorough witness.

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:43.449
And by about 60 of our common era, less than 30 years after the Christians had received their commission,

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:51.449
Paul could write to the congregation in Colossi that the good news had been preached in all creation under heaven.

00:03:52.449 --> 00:04:03.449
What a testimony to the power of God's Holy Spirit, and the faith, zeal, and determination of those early disciples.

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:12.449
In the late 1800s, a small group of Bible students rose to the challenge of bearing thorough witness.

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:22.449
An article in the April 1881 issue of Zion's Watchtower had the thrilling title, Wanted, 1000 Preachers.

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:29.449
Today, Jehovah's Witnesses are bearing witness in 240 lands.

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:32.449
But doing so has its challenges.

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:37.449
What are some of those challenges? And what can we do to meet them?

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:47.449
Many of our brothers face the challenge of long distances, climate extremes, rough terrain, and poor travel conditions.

00:04:47.449 --> 00:05:03.449
In some areas, just getting to meet people is a challenge. To add to the challenge, Revelation 146 reminds us that the good news would be declared to every nation and tribe and tongue and people.

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:12.449
This can require learning a new language and understanding different religious, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds.

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:19.449
It can mean coping with unresponsive territories, apathy, and poor living conditions.

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:30.449
Jesus warned that opposers would try to hinder or stop the preaching work. No doubt you are facing some form of challenge in your local territory.

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:36.449
We cannot begin to give possible solutions to all the obstacles we face today.

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:48.449
But it is helpful to learn how others are coping with their challenges, and this can stimulate our thinking to identify ways to meet our challenges.

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:55.449
Let's focus on three Bible principles that will help us to carry out our ministry successfully.

00:05:55.449 --> 00:06:06.449
One, trust in Jehovah. Two, be flexible. And three, stay focused.

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:12.449
How can trusting in Jehovah help us? Consider an example.

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:20.449
During the 1990s, Jehovah's Witnesses in France endured an avalanche of negative media reports.

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:28.449
As a result of these vicious attacks, some brothers lost their jobs. Witness children were taunted at school.

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:34.449
Preaching became extremely difficult in some areas. How did they cope?

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:48.449
The turning point came in January 1999. The governing body approved a special campaign to distribute a magazine-sized tract that exposed all of the accusations as false.

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:58.449
Beginning early one Friday morning, witnesses throughout France distributed 12 million copies of the tract in just three days.

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:03.449
This campaign gave them renewed strength and boldness to preach.

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:15.449
In the 19 years that followed, there was a continuous increase in the number of publishers, and the ranks of regular pioneers swelled to over 15,000.

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:25.449
If you constantly face a barrage of negative media reports, does this mean that you need a special campaign to meet the challenge?

00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:42.449
Not necessarily. Although the campaign was a stimulus, brothers and sisters in France said that what really gave them strength and boldness were the words of 2 Chronicles 32-8. Let's read it.

00:07:42.449 --> 00:07:55.449
The setting is in the time of King Hezekiah of Judah. The people were beaten down by the repeated threats and taunts of the Assyrians. What strengthened them?

00:07:55.449 --> 00:08:00.449
Speaking about the King of Assyria, King Hezekiah declared,

00:08:01.449 --> 00:08:18.449
With him is an arm of flesh, but with us is Jehovah our God to help us and to fight our battles. What was the result? The people were strengthened by the words of King Hezekiah of Judah.

00:08:19.449 --> 00:08:25.449
Just hearing this reminder that Jehovah would help them was enough to strengthen the Jews.

00:08:25.449 --> 00:08:31.449
Jehovah took action and sent an angel to destroy the enemy army.

00:08:31.449 --> 00:08:35.450
Does Jehovah use his angels to help us today?

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:40.450
Note what we read at Revelation 146.

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:54.450
I saw another angel flying in mid-Heaven, and he had everlasting good news to declare to those who dwell on the earth, to every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:09:00.450
Be sensitive to angelic direction and the leadings of God's Holy Spirit.

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:10.450
If you feel moved to make that one last call, or to speak to the person next to you on the bus, do it. Speak up!

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:18.450
It may well be that an angel is directing you to one who is rightly disposed for everlasting life.

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:26.450
Now let's consider the second Bible principle that will help us to bear thorough witness. Be flexible.

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:35.450
Sometimes just getting to talk to people can be a challenge. To overcome this obstacle, we need to be flexible.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:45.450
Takanori and Yumi Takahashi have served in territories that are as different as night and day. Recently they visited our studio.

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:52.450
Listen as they tell us how they have learned to meet the challenges of bearing thorough witness.

00:09:52.450 --> 00:10:02.500
Takanori and Yumi, welcome to our studio. Thank you for inviting us, and we're very happy to have you here.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:14.500
Takanori, you and I go back a long way. I still remember when you came into Japan Bethel back in 1977, and we served in the same congregation for a number of years.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:20.500
But then in 1990, you had a big change in your life. Would you like to tell us what happened?

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:26.500
Yes, my twin brother Nobuaki was also serving at Bethel.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:32.500
To our surprise, we were assigned to Papua New Guinea as missionaries.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:38.500
That was a big change, and here you are working in the rural territory of Papu New Guinea.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:46.500
During your 25 years in Papu New Guinea, I understand that you served in the missionary field, in the circuit work, and also at Bethel.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:50.500
So Yumi, when did you come into the picture?

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:57.500
Takanori and I were married in September 1993, and I joined him in the missionary work.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:02.500
Adapting to remote territories such as this was a challenge.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:08.500
So in order to bear thorough witness, what kind of challenges did you have to overcome?

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:15.500
The people of Papua New Guinea are very friendly. They have a deep respect for the Bible.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:24.500
It was easy to relax. Speak to them face to face, to read the scriptures together, and read with them.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:28.500
Those don't sound like challenges. Did you face any obstacles?

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:38.500
When we preached in the villages, the response of the local people often depended on the response of the village chief.

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:49.500
If he listened, almost the whole village listened. But if his response was negative, the people would walk away and hide in the bush.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:56.500
So we would always show respect and approach the village chief first.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:01.500
This often, move him to view our visit with favor.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:05.500
Challenging the cities was mainly security.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:12.500
It wasn't safe for us to go into some areas alone or to visit homes regularly.

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:19.500
So we would ask our Bible students to come to the Kingdom Hall for their study before the meeting.

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.500
That was a good way to encourage them to attend meetings.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:35.500
Well, it's obvious that you enjoyed your service in Papua New Guinea. But now you're serving as special pioneers in the Myhama congregation, just 20 minutes from downtown Tokyo.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:45.500
So you went from a territory where people have deep respect for the Bible to a land where less than 1% of the people claim to be Christian.

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:52.500
So what other kind of differences did you find between your territory in Japan now and your missionary territory?

00:12:52.500 --> 00:13:04.500
Oh, it's very different. Tokyo Disneyland is in our territory. And 70% of homes are in high-security apartment buildings.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:12.500
We have to stand in the lobby, in front of the door, press a button and speak to our camera.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:18.500
Coming from Papua New Guinea, we found it challenging to work this territory.

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:25.500
We were used to friendly discussions face to face. Now we see only the lens of a camera.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:30.500
But we have learned to view the camera as our friend.

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:38.500
As your friend, I think most of us find it challenging to speak to a camera. So how do you overcome this challenge?

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:45.500
We know that, as soon as we push the button, our face shows up on the screen inside of the apartment.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:52.500
We stand on arm lengths from the camera, so that our face is framed nicely.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:14:00.500
And we adjust our volume accordingly, taking into consideration the Doha Man and others who may be listening.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:06.500
We say our greeting about two seconds after we push the button.

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:10.500
Just when we know that they are looking at the monitor.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:18.500
Our friendly greeting and one smile makes them feel like we can actually see their face.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:27.500
We prepare a specific, appealing introduction and show them respect and consideration.

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:34.500
The people in our territory like to be viewed as successful, not as people who have problems.

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:45.500
So we try to focus on positive subjects. We prepare a variety of subjects so that they don't hear the same message over and over.

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:50.500
Like many people, Japanese do not like to be put on a spot.

00:14:51.500 --> 00:15:03.500
So instead of asking a question and waiting for them to answer, we use the teaching method of our trucks and give three possible answers for them to choose from.

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:08.500
Well, have you had positive results from this intercom preaching?

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:14.500
Since we started to use this method, the number of note homes has decreased.

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:24.500
And also, when we meet people on the street, sometimes they say they know us because they saw us on their intercom.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:36.500
That was excellent. And thank you Takanori and Yumi for sharing with us how you have met the challenge of bearing thorough witness in a variety of territories.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:43.500
First Corinthians 9, 22 and 23. Let's read it.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:51.500
I have become all things to people of all sorts so that I might by all possible means save some.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:59.500
But I do all things for the sake of the good news in order to share it with others.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:05.500
Become all things. Do all things. In other words, be flexible.

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:13.500
Apply the suggestions in the meeting workbook. Get well acquainted with each tool in the teaching toolbox.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:23.500
Observe how experienced publishers and pioneers use those tools. Understand the feelings and circumstances of people in the territory.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:28.500
Even in the same territory, we may need to use a variety of approaches.

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:37.500
For example, about 40% of the apartment buildings in the Takahashi's territory do not allow the witnesses to enter the lobby.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:42.500
So they do public and informal witnessing to reach those people.

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:47.500
Now let's consider the third Bible principle. Stay focused.

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:51.500
At Matthew 6.22, Jesus said,

00:16:51.500 --> 00:17:00.500
The lamp of the body is the eye. If then your eye is focused, your whole body will be bright.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:09.500
Keeping our eye focused means keeping our life simple in order to concentrate on spiritual matters.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:16.500
Distractions take our attention and energy away from our responsibility to bear thorough witness.

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:22.500
Before we can teach those who are rightly disposed for everlasting life, we have to find them.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:33.500
We leave no stone unturned as we search for them at their homes, on the streets, in parks, in stores, and at the workplace.

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:44.500
There is no on-off switch for our preaching work. Our preaching switch must be on at all times.

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:50.500
Not only do we look for opportunities to preach, but we also make opportunities.

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:55.500
What if our efforts to find interested ones are not fruitful?

00:17:55.500 --> 00:18:01.500
Jesus did not say that every human must become a disciple before the end comes.

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:12.500
Rather, he said that the end will come after the good news has been preached in all the inhabited earth and a witness has been given to all the nations.

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:16.500
The Apostle Paul stayed focused on his ministry.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:24.500
May we imitate his positive attitude expressed at Acts 20-24.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:30.500
Nevertheless, I do not consider my own life of any importance to me.

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:44.500
If only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus to bear thorough witness to the good news of the undeserved kindness of God.

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:49.500
The opportunity to bear thorough witness will soon be over.

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:58.500
May we use the remaining time effectively to search for deserving ones and to teach them the truth.

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:04.500
Imitate the faith of Hezekiah and trust in Jehovah.

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:09.500
Learn from the Apostle Paul and be flexible.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:14.500
Obey Jesus' direction and stay focused.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:21.869
Then you too can meet the challenge of bearing thorough witness.

00:19:21.869 --> 00:19:27.869
Another challenge of bearing thorough witness is preaching in the midst of civil unrest.

00:19:27.869 --> 00:19:37.869
Starting in the 1960s, our brothers in Northern Ireland endured 30 violent years known as the Troubles.

00:19:37.869 --> 00:19:41.869
K. Herrigan learned the truth during those difficult times.

00:19:41.869 --> 00:19:48.869
Listen, as K. describes how she was drawn to the truth and how it changed her life.

00:19:52.559 --> 00:20:04.130
We were signs of stones, petrol bombs, people screaming.

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:07.130
Those were the sins we grew up with.

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:19.130
Back then I was raised as a Catholic in an area which became known for the troubles that began there.

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.130
We were a very divided city.

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:27.130
It was Catholic, nationalist and unionist Protestant.

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:32.130
A close friend had been in the wrong place at the wrong time.

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:44.539
After the funeral, I went to the chapel and knelt down and addressed God directly.

00:20:45.539 --> 00:20:54.630
There has been far too much death and it can't go on.

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:58.630
But I promise you, I will be the best Catholic.

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:01.630
I can be.

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:08.259
But you need to give me some answers.

00:21:08.259 --> 00:21:19.259
I went back home and was trying to be a good Catholic and Jehovah's people knocked at the door.

00:21:19.259 --> 00:21:22.259
My husband had a short story.

00:21:22.259 --> 00:21:31.259
Because I had made an agreement with God, I would stay in the kitchen but with the door open.

00:21:31.259 --> 00:21:39.259
I heard the young couple back then and they used a name I had never heard before.

00:21:39.259 --> 00:21:43.259
It was God's personal name.

00:21:43.259 --> 00:21:47.259
My husband decided that this was not for him.

00:21:47.259 --> 00:22:05.740
But I remember popping my head through the door and going, but I am the hope that all those people, all those peers, all the burials that we had had, would be reversed.

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:10.910
I was baptized in 1985.

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:34.059
And while it was lovely to be one of Jehovah's people, when you looked around and realized none of Jehovah's people lived here, I felt so isolated in my own violence was something that could break out in certain areas.

00:22:35.059 --> 00:22:49.059
But almost every day, we're talking sniper fire, we're talking civil unrest, coming from a Catholic, Republican background.

00:22:49.059 --> 00:22:54.529
I would have feared going into some areas.

00:22:54.529 --> 00:23:00.529
There were places that I would never have been but for the truth.

00:23:00.529 --> 00:23:05.529
Jehovah's people had come to my door personally knocked on it.

00:23:05.529 --> 00:23:16.420
We're aware of the dangers around them and that in turn would have faded me to do the same thing.

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:24.859
One day on the monastery, I knocked on the door and a man opened the door.

00:23:24.859 --> 00:23:33.859
But I noticed he looked hyper vigilant and I thought there's something not right here.

00:23:33.859 --> 00:23:41.859
So I had my Bible and I offered him the watchtower and immediately his face relaxed.

00:23:42.859 --> 00:23:47.859
And he said, oh, my wife reached those magazines just a second.

00:23:47.859 --> 00:23:53.859
And as he passed the table on the hall, he simply put a revolver on the table.

00:23:53.859 --> 00:24:06.329
At that time, I realized that Jehovah is not a God who is prejudice.

00:24:08.769 --> 00:24:20.529
I'm more integrated with the congregation and the fear of working in other territories that I would never have been on as God.

00:24:20.529 --> 00:24:28.940
Jehovah widened your world. Jehovah gives you a reason to get up in the morning.

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:37.940
Put on your coat, walk out the front door and the happiness of bringing good news.

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:50.980
It's a wonderful feeling to know that in the time you buried Jehovah's name, it's something to be very bright of.

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:57.150
Something to be absolutely bright of.

00:24:57.150 --> 00:25:01.150
Trusting in Jehovah helped Kay overcome her fears.

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:04.150
What blessings did she receive?

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:11.529
Kay said that she has the happiness of bringing good news to everyone.

00:25:11.529 --> 00:25:20.529
Since 2013, the School for Kingdom Evangelizers has prepared brothers and sisters to serve where there is a greater need.

00:25:20.529 --> 00:25:26.529
Even with this training, however, graduates sometimes find their assignments challenging.

00:25:26.529 --> 00:25:32.839
We'll see that in our next segment from Tanzania.

00:25:32.839 --> 00:25:36.839
I wanted to help the deaf so that they too can know Jehovah.

00:25:37.839 --> 00:25:45.250
So I decided to move to a sign language territory, the sign language group in Der Esalam.

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:56.779
We had to travel by bus and sometimes we traveled far, stacking a traffic jam for two to three hours and it was expensive.

00:25:56.779 --> 00:26:00.779
I still remember my early days in service with the sign language group.

00:26:00.779 --> 00:26:08.779
I was very inexperienced with the language and one day my service partner asked me to conduct a Bible study.

00:26:08.779 --> 00:26:14.779
Every time I tried to talk to the student, she didn't understand.

00:26:14.779 --> 00:26:21.779
As I kept trying, she became more and more frustrated with me and I started to feel discouraged.

00:26:21.779 --> 00:26:24.779
I wanted to help, but I was powerless.

00:26:24.779 --> 00:26:31.609
I felt bad. I told myself, I still don't know the deaf.

00:26:31.609 --> 00:26:33.609
I still don't know sign language.

00:26:33.609 --> 00:26:42.170
Why has Jehovah brought me into this field in which I'm not able to help the deaf?

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:49.170
I was invited to the School for Kingdom Evangelizers in 2014 from September to November.

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:54.170
After graduating, I received an assignment in sign language again.

00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:57.170
Jehovah truly helped me so much.

00:26:57.170 --> 00:27:05.170
That was exactly the encouragement I needed to persevere in learning the language and becoming more effective in my assignment.

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:11.170
I was able to conduct my own Bible studies and they could really understand me now.

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:17.170
When we started, there were two baptized deaf publishers, but now they are over 10.

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:25.170
I've had the opportunity to help three deaf people to make progress, to dedicate themselves to Jehovah and get baptized.

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:34.170
The training I received at the School is still helping me now in my new assignment at the Translation Office, where I set together with my husband.

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:47.950
We are joyful because we know that through this work, many deaf people will receive publications in their language, and this will bring about an increase in this territory.

00:27:47.950 --> 00:28:02.950
I graduated from the School for Kingdom Evangelizers in 2015, and it was a privilege to receive the assignment to call help the Messiah to know Jehovah in their mother tongue.

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:14.950
Traveling is difficult. Sometimes I travel by vehicle, but sometimes there are areas in which there are no vehicles, so I'm forced to walk.

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:24.950
Sometimes I can travel by motorcycle to reach many more people, but still transportation is a difficult part of it.

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:34.950
There are valleys, there are mountains, there are uphills, there are downhills, so transportation is difficult.

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:39.950
When I finally reached the territory, I was able to find the Messiah.

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:51.950
I was apprehensive about their reaction because I know their culture. They don't know Jehovah, so I wondered what would happen when I reached their territory.

00:28:51.950 --> 00:29:07.950
During that stressful time, I prayed to Jehovah. I read his word the Bible, I meditated on accounts of our brothers and sisters mentioned in the Bible, and after prayer, Jehovah gave me strength.

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:15.950
I was able to return to them, make return visit, and start Bible studies, so the results have been good.

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:23.950
I am happy that after starting studies, some started taking steps and attending meetings.

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:33.950
They later made good progress, and now some of them are our brothers and sisters. They dedicated themselves and were baptized.

00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:44.950
I feel so much joy. Jehovah has given me the strength, the ability to be used to further the preaching of the good news and to help the Messiah spiritually.

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:59.440
Sabina said that she was discouraged. Saitoti was stressed. Have you ever felt that way about your ministry? What helped them?

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:09.440
Sabina persevered. She became proficient in sign language and had the joy of helping several deaf ones learn the truth.

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:20.440
Saitoti relied on prayer and meditation. Jehovah gave him the strength to bear witness to the Messiah, and we saw the encouraging results.

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:35.440
Showing love and concern for people is a vital element in bearing thorough witness. This was the subject of a recent morning worship program conducted by Brother William Turner, and we're happy to share it with you.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:40.440
His theme is, make known the good news.

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:50.440
How does it make you feel knowing God's support is real, and that He's entrusted us to do the work we do?

00:30:50.440 --> 00:31:01.440
We know that song. We love that song. But I'd be able to stop to meditate on the lyrics. How do we feel?

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:11.440
Because really it's such a tremendous amazing privilege that Jehovah has entrusted to his people the work of kingdom preaching and disciple making.

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:30.440
While the work at Bethel contributes to the preaching work in a very precious and unique way, we still recognize it's quite special to be able to assist someone in the ministry and watch them progress to the point of making a dedication and symbolizing that by water baptism.

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:46.440
Our text comments mentions the qualities of gratitude and undeserved kindness, and these are good qualities because they're qualities that motivate us, that move us to action, that touch our emotions.

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:53.440
Why is this emotional investment so important when it comes to our ministry?

00:31:53.440 --> 00:32:02.440
I think, for example, of our greatest teacher and preacher, whoever walked the earth, that is Jesus Christ.

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:14.490
Turn with me and your Bibles, please, to Luke chapter 19, and we'll just take a look at one instance of how Jesus demonstrated this love and concern.

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:32.269
Luke chapter 19, verse 41, it says, and when he, that is Jesus, got nearby, he viewed the city Jerusalem and wept over it.

00:32:32.269 --> 00:32:46.869
How interesting. Jesus' heart was filled with so much emotion that his eyes brimmed over with tears when he contemplated the people, their rejection of the message,

00:32:47.869 --> 00:32:57.869
the siege that was to follow, does not show his love for people, and obviously that love was made evident the entire time that he was here on the earth.

00:32:57.869 --> 00:33:12.869
Now, we may not give way to tears every time we go into our territory and engage in the ministry, but certainly we want to imitate Jesus' example because it's so vital that we have and demonstrate love for people.

00:33:12.869 --> 00:33:24.869
It reminds me of a conversation I had with a missionary sister some time ago, and at the time she was reviewing her personal circumstances and she felt that at that time she could comfortably handle 10 Bible studies.

00:33:24.869 --> 00:33:33.869
So I asked her how things were going. She said, well, actually I have 20. She says I was able to get rid of six. She says, but I just can't turn over these last four.

00:33:33.869 --> 00:33:39.869
She says, there's such a part of my life. I just can't let them go.

00:33:39.869 --> 00:33:48.869
I don't sound like a good problem to have, but doesn't it highlight her love for people? She was emotionally invested.

00:33:48.869 --> 00:34:00.869
Now, we also have to admit that while preaching is a wonderful work, actually carrying it out is not always easy to do.

00:34:00.869 --> 00:34:10.869
Perhaps at times we may feel like the prophet Jeremiah. You recall when he was commissioned as a prophet, he gave Jehovah a number of reasons why he shouldn't be selected.

00:34:10.869 --> 00:34:15.869
He was too shy, too young, wasn't able to speak well.

00:34:15.869 --> 00:34:31.300
And then once he got into his assignment and the opposition and the ridicule started, well, let's take note of his feelings. Turn with me please to Jeremiah in chapter 20.

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:43.380
Jeremiah chapter 20 will begin with the B part of verse eight. For me, the word of Jehovah has been the cause of insults and jeering all day long.

00:34:43.380 --> 00:35:04.210
So I said, I am not going to make mention of him and I will speak no more in his name. Have you ever had times where you felt like Jeremiah, where we just didn't have the desire or feel like speaking to others about Jehovah?

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:18.519
And maybe it was for similar reasons. We're shy. We feel nervous. People in the territory are indifferent. Or could it just be that we're just tired?

00:35:18.519 --> 00:35:23.519
The energy that we feel we need, we just don't have it.

00:35:23.519 --> 00:35:34.519
That's normal to feel this way of times. Absolutely. But let's take note of what Jeremiah says next. Let's finish verse nine.

00:35:34.519 --> 00:35:46.519
He says, but in my heart, it became like a burning fire. Shut up in my bones. And I was tired of holding it in. I could no longer endure it.

00:35:46.519 --> 00:36:02.519
You notice it was Jeremiah's love for Jehovah, his zeal for the truth, his strong spirituality. All of these were things that were able to help him remain invested and be able to overcome any temporary discouragement.

00:36:02.519 --> 00:36:05.519
He might have been feeling at that time.

00:36:05.519 --> 00:36:13.519
So what can help us to stay invested to maintain our love for people? Well, there are many ways, but we'll discuss two.

00:36:14.519 --> 00:36:23.519
First, Jeremiah's example shows us that there is never a substitute for study of God's word.

00:36:23.519 --> 00:36:29.519
Did you notice what was that burning fire shut up in his bones?

00:36:29.519 --> 00:36:33.519
Verse eight tells us it was the word of Jehovah.

00:36:33.519 --> 00:36:45.519
So it was Jeremiah's appreciation for the importance of his message that made him responsive to the encouragement he received when he read God's word.

00:36:45.519 --> 00:36:53.519
And it works the same for us as well. Study of God's word helps to reinforce our love for Jehovah.

00:36:53.519 --> 00:37:04.519
It's a constant reminder that we're living in the last days that we're deep in the time of the end, and we need to do all that we can to find those who are rightly disposed for everlasting life.

00:37:04.519 --> 00:37:10.519
Yes, it is natural. We are going to experience discouragement from time to time.

00:37:10.519 --> 00:37:20.519
But when we pray to Jehovah for help, you see, if his word is in our hearts, then Jehovah can freely impart his Holy Spirit to us.

00:37:21.519 --> 00:37:30.519
He can give us what we need to be boldly preachers of the good news and be productive in our ministry.

00:37:30.519 --> 00:37:40.519
Now, the second thing that can help us is by applying the suggestions that are given to us by the slave to help us improve our ministry.

00:37:40.519 --> 00:37:47.519
Now, perhaps in the past, preaching may have been difficult, maybe because of just pressure we put upon ourselves.

00:37:47.519 --> 00:37:55.519
Perhaps we may have felt that we had to have the perfect presentation, or we had to place a certain amount of literature.

00:37:55.519 --> 00:38:03.519
But how loving it is that we see that with the various adjustments that have been made in our ministry, well, hopefully some of that anxiety has been lifted.

00:38:03.519 --> 00:38:15.519
Because now we know our focus is on starting conversations. And with the help of prayer and God's Spirit, we can see how that just naturally progresses into a witness.

00:38:15.519 --> 00:38:26.519
We just think back for a moment to the example of Jesus. We can only imagine how many preaching opportunities Jesus must have had just from starting conversations.

00:38:26.519 --> 00:38:39.519
Of course, the one we're most familiar with to John chapter 4, the Samaritan woman at the well, not only was that a great witness, but just think about all of those who became believers afterward.

00:38:39.519 --> 00:38:48.019
And all of that started simply from Jesus starting a conversation asking for water.

00:38:48.019 --> 00:38:54.019
We may not always have as many opportunities as Bethel to engage in the house to housework as we would like.

00:38:54.019 --> 00:39:02.019
But certainly as we travel, as we move about, this can present greater opportunities to start conversations.

00:39:02.019 --> 00:39:09.019
In last month's meeting workbook, there was an article, starting conversations that can lead to a witness.

00:39:09.019 --> 00:39:16.019
And that article just provided many excellent practical suggestions that we can implement.

00:39:16.019 --> 00:39:28.019
So if we follow these suggestions, well, this is a nice way that we can show and demonstrate our gratitude. We're making the best use of our time to start a witness.

00:39:28.019 --> 00:39:40.019
So as we mentioned, there are many ways that we can show our gratitude, but certainly these two, our study of God's Word, applying the suggestions to improve our ministry, our two ways that we can certainly implement.

00:39:40.019 --> 00:39:46.019
So an implementation of Jesus, Jeremiah, many other faithful witnesses of Jehovah.

00:39:46.019 --> 00:40:00.019
May we do what we can to show that we are invested, that we show our love for God, our love for people as we appreciatively carry out our commission to preach the good news.

00:40:01.019 --> 00:40:06.019
Love never fails. Was the theme of last year's conventions.

00:40:06.019 --> 00:40:11.019
Twenty-four international conventions were held in different parts of the earth.

00:40:11.019 --> 00:40:24.019
As we'll see in the following report, our international conventions showcased the love and unity of Jehovah's people, and they provided a tremendous witness.

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:33.840
Jesus said that the identifying mark of true Christians would be their love for one another.

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:40.840
This was especially evident at our 2019 Love Never Fails International conventions.

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:56.159
I never expected the welcome that we received. They were over 200 brothers in the airport.

00:40:56.159 --> 00:41:04.159
For me, it's like I'm a paradise already because the love I feel here wherever I turn this love.

00:41:06.599 --> 00:41:13.599
As I walked around the corner, the reception of the friends, the way they embraced me, was something that I could not have expected.

00:41:13.599 --> 00:41:27.420
No one could have even described it to me.

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:35.420
Mexico has a lot of different cultures, but here in this stadium we are one people, united by love, serving Jehovah.

00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:41.989
That's unique, it's wonderful, and it's all thanks to love.

00:41:41.989 --> 00:41:52.340
It doesn't matter where we come from or what language we speak, the language here is love.

00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:58.340
Our love of neighbor motivated us to share in a global preaching campaign.

00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:11.340
Foreign delegates worked shoulder to shoulder with hosts from the local city to invite millions of people from around the world to one of the 24 international conventions.

00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:24.340
This gave our brothers and sisters from different parts of the globe an opportunity to get to know each other, united by the common goal of spreading the good news to everyone they met.

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:29.340
I worked in field service with the sister who used to study the Bible with a Brazilian woman.

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:33.340
The sister had prayed to send a Brazilian sister to accompany her.

00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:44.340
When we visited the woman together, she could see the love we have between us and the efforts we made to come so far to attend the convention here in Denmark.

00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:50.340
Over a million people attended the international conventions in many different languages.

00:42:50.340 --> 00:43:00.340
Both foreign and local delegates, as well as newly interested ones, were able to learn firsthand how love never fails.

00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:07.340
Close your cells with love for it as a perfect bond of union.

00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:13.139
First, love identifies us.

00:43:13.139 --> 00:43:16.139
Humility, that's love in action.

00:43:16.139 --> 00:43:21.139
Loyal love is a beautiful aspect of Jehovah's personality.

00:43:21.139 --> 00:43:24.139
Well Jesus made it simple, didn't he?

00:43:24.139 --> 00:43:32.139
He said, look for the love. Look for the love and you'll find the right religion.

00:43:32.139 --> 00:43:41.139
Christian love has power. It can reach hearts in ways that the spoken word cannot.

00:43:41.139 --> 00:43:49.139
But really, what other group of persons on earth are interested in discussing love that doesn't fail.

00:43:49.139 --> 00:43:54.139
When someone sees us, they should see a loving individual.

00:43:54.139 --> 00:44:01.139
When they see any one of us who are servants of Jehovah, then they should see love.

00:44:01.139 --> 00:44:13.739
In addition to spending time in the ministry, activities were planned so that delegates could get to know their brothers better.

00:44:13.739 --> 00:44:27.699
This gave delegates the opportunity to learn about the culture and our spiritual heritage in the host country.

00:44:27.699 --> 00:44:37.199
In some cities, they visited exhibits and locations where previously our faith and love had been tested.

00:44:37.199 --> 00:44:49.199
For example, delegates in Berlin had the opportunity to visit Soxonhausen concentration camp, where many of our brothers were imprisoned during World War II.

00:44:50.199 --> 00:44:56.199
I thought it was especially amazing, despite the circumstances of the brothers and sisters faced.

00:44:56.199 --> 00:45:03.829
Even their persecutors had to recognize the true, identify a mark of Christianity, of love.

00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:10.829
This visit showed the faithful endurance our brothers and sisters demonstrated under vicious persecution.

00:45:10.829 --> 00:45:18.829
And the love they had for Jehovah, a fitting example of love that never fails.

00:45:18.829 --> 00:45:25.829
Adolf Hitler wanted to exterminate Jehovah's Witnesses. He called them a brood.

00:45:25.829 --> 00:45:34.829
But instead, Jehovah's Witnesses are still here, proving that Christian love never fails.

00:45:34.829 --> 00:45:45.340
Another example of faith and endurance was seen in Seoul Korea.

00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:52.340
Since 1953, young Korean brothers have been imprisoned for refusing military service.

00:45:52.340 --> 00:46:04.650
Altogether, over 19,000 brothers who refused to compromise their faith spent nearly 37,000 years in prison.

00:46:04.650 --> 00:46:13.650
Delegates were able to visit a neutrality exhibition to learn more about the strong faith and unwavering courage these young brothers displayed.

00:46:13.650 --> 00:46:25.159
On February 28, 2019, the last of our imprisoned brothers were released.

00:46:25.159 --> 00:46:32.159
Because I received a not guilty verdict just two weeks ago, I was able to attend this international convention.

00:46:32.159 --> 00:46:36.159
I am so grateful to Jehovah.

00:46:36.159 --> 00:46:44.159
My son receiving this acquittal enabled him to attend this convention. We never imagined this would be possible.

00:46:44.159 --> 00:46:54.159
What a joy it was for these brothers to attend this historic international convention, alongside their families and thousands of foreign delegates.

00:46:55.159 --> 00:47:01.159
Just being able to sit next to my son for the convention completely fills my heart.

00:47:01.159 --> 00:47:21.110
Despite an ongoing economic crisis, many delegates from Venezuela were able to attend the International Convention in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

00:47:21.110 --> 00:47:28.219
Coming from Venezuela, it's difficult to earn a living or save money.

00:47:28.219 --> 00:47:33.219
We have to sell our electronic devices and work long hours to be here.

00:47:33.219 --> 00:47:36.219
But these sacrifices will always be worth it.

00:47:36.219 --> 00:47:47.099
The love we show to our brothers is possible because of the love Jehovah shows us.

00:47:47.099 --> 00:47:53.099
An expression of his love to us comes in the form of his word the Bible.

00:47:53.099 --> 00:48:00.099
In Copenhagen, Denmark, delegates from Iceland were delighted to receive a special gift.

00:48:00.099 --> 00:48:15.239
We are happy to announce a release of the Icelandic New World Translation of the Dreshing Research.

00:48:15.239 --> 00:48:59.619
Additionally, at several 2019 international conventions, our brothers received the revised New World Translation in the language of their heart.

00:48:59.619 --> 00:49:02.619
I can really feel the love from Jehovah.

00:49:02.619 --> 00:49:10.619
He's given us this wonderful gift because he wants us to know that the words in this book are from him.

00:49:10.619 --> 00:49:25.000
The conventions also gave thousands the opportunity to express their love for Jehovah by symbolizing their dedication to him through baptism.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:30.000
The love amongst our brothers was evident to onlookers as well.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:35.000
The police directing traffic had less work than they normally do.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:41.000
The atmosphere was so contagious that they started greeting foreign and local delegates.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000
They were so happy.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.000
They said, this country does not need more police.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:51.000
What it needs is more Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:50:02.000
Our 2019 international conventions have given us an opportunity to demonstrate how Jehovah's love motivates us to love.

00:50:03.309 --> 00:50:10.309
Well, as we approach the end of this system of things, we're going to need love more than ever before.

00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:19.309
Of course, we need loyalty. Of course, we need endurance. And of course, we're going to sing that song of courage.

00:50:19.309 --> 00:50:25.309
But remember what else we want? Jehovah's loyal love.

00:50:25.309 --> 00:50:37.309
May we be determined to imitate Him in letting our love never, ever fail all to Jehovah's glory.

00:50:37.309 --> 00:50:51.150
Our program has focused on meeting the challenge of bearing thorough witness.

00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:58.150
Before we close, here's the video postcard of our I Modest Speaking Brothers and Sisters in Bolivia.

00:50:59.150 --> 00:51:07.150
This South American country is home to about 28,500 publishers and nearly 7,000 pioneers.

00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:15.150
Bolivia officially recognizes Spanish and 36 indigenous languages, including I Moda.

00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:21.150
Of the country's 11 million people, about 1.6 million speak I Moda.

00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:26.150
This is the remote translation office in the city of El Alto.

00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:33.150
Twenty translators are helping to provide Bible-based literature in the I Moda language.

00:51:33.150 --> 00:51:40.150
In 2017, the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures was released in I Moda.

00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:49.150
Most of the I Moda speaking territory surrounds beautiful Lake Titicaca and includes parts of Bolivia and Peru.

00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:55.150
Reaching those in isolated villages involves hours of traveling and walking.

00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:58.150
The response is encouraging.

00:51:58.150 --> 00:52:04.150
The I Moda people respect God's word and highly appreciate spiritual discussions.

00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:12.150
Today there are 31 I Moda congregations and 14 I Moda language groups in Bolivia.

00:52:13.150 --> 00:52:24.150
The Copacabana I Moda congregation is located at an altitude of 3,800 meters or nearly 12,500 feet.

00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:31.150
The congregation includes this isolated group located about an hour and a half from Copacabana.

00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:35.150
Copacabana is a very popular tourist spot.

00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:41.150
People come from around the world to see Indian culture and beautiful Lake Titicaca.

00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:45.150
The congregation engages in many forms of public witnessing.

00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:51.150
Their territory even includes an island in the middle of the lake.

00:52:51.150 --> 00:53:00.150
Our brothers and sisters of the Copacabana I Moda congregation send you their warm Christian love and greetings.

00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:07.150
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is J.W. Broadcasting.
