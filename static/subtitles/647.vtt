00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.849
I would like to talk about something people keep watching since the annual meeting and that's JW Broadcasting.

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:19.850
Now in the October monthly program we saw a short video explaining the speed with which the studio in 312 was put together due to the tireless efforts and cooperation of those involved.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:26.850
Now as with the Warwick project, we've heard vigilant prayers, praying for Jehovah's blessing and support.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:35.850
And similar prayers were sent to Jehovah by those who knew about JW Broadcasting when it was first decided in early summer.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.850
Did Jehovah hear the prayers?

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.850
I'd like to share two experiences of the dozens that could be shared and let you be the judge.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.850
Extremely tight schedule to say the least.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:53.850
One critical item we needed was a equipment console for the control room.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.850
It's a large piece of equipment.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.850
Companies make these to order, they're not stock anywhere.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.850
So our brothers made a personal visit to one company to plead their case.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.849
They needed the latest July 15th.

00:01:05.849 --> 00:01:09.849
The owner showed their June July schedule and he said there's no way it's going to happen.

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:11.849
You're not going to get it in July.

00:01:11.849 --> 00:01:15.849
Sometime later, certainly not July 15th.

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:20.849
Well the brothers were disappointed, they were not to the car, they were sitting in the car discussing this is the only option.

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:22.849
There's no other second option here.

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:27.849
They put the keys in the ignition to leave and there was a knock on the driver's window.

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:32.849
The owner had run across the parking lot and he said I think we found your console.

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:39.849
A company in South Africa had ordered one sometime before and he said we just learned they went bankrupt.

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:45.849
Well it turns out the console was wrapped ready to ship sitting on a dock in Staten Island.

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:48.849
He said you can pick it up today if you'd like.

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:52.849
Well the other thing is the company had ordered it.

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:54.849
They had already paid 40% of the total.

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:59.849
So the owner gave it to us at 60% of its actual cost.

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:01.849
It was exactly what we wanted.

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:03.849
Only just a little bit better.

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:05.849
You be the judge.

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:07.849
We ordered three broadcast cameras.

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:09.849
They had to be a very specific model.

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.849
They had plenty of time it seemed because the due date was July 22nd.

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.849
We ordered from the largest electronic supply company in the country.

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.849
Time March Donge, July 12th or not here.

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.849
Our brothers called the company repeatedly.

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.849
Our brothers even said could you call Sony in Japan and have them FedExas to us.

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.849
The company wasn't real cooperative.

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.849
They said you'll get them when you get them.

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.849
Well Thursday July 17th came.

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:35.849
Our brothers had an idea.

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.849
Let's call the purchasing brothers in Japan.

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:38.849
They could buy it.

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.849
They could FedExas to us.

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:45.849
Well the brothers in Japan checked with Sony, two other companies, and they came back with the answer.

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.849
There's no possible way of getting these cameras anywhere in Japan.

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.849
Our brothers sitting around disappointed again.

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.849
And one of them almost sarcastically said, what do we have to do?

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.849
Go to eBay.

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.849
Well they all laughed at this ludicrous thought.

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.849
But then the room went silent.

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:05.849
A few clicks on the mouse.

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.849
They found the exact model at a company in Texas.

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:16.849
And the company had three, not two, not four, three.

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:18.849
Oh what kind of condition they'd be off of eBay.

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.849
They were brand new in boxes on the shelf.

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:24.849
But we needed three controllers and we had ordered model 1501.

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:26.849
The company only had model 1500.

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.849
Our brothers frantically searched the cut sheets.

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.849
Can we make a 1500 work?

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.849
And in this additional research they found that we had ordered the wrong one.

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:42.099
We really needed a 1500, which is exactly what the company had.

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:43.099
They shipped it on the 18th.

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:48.099
It was supposed to be delivered on the 19th at 10 o'clock Saturday morning, 25 lobby.

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:49.099
How are the company wrong?

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:53.099
They addressed them to the 30 Columbia Heights Ferman Street doc.

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:59.099
So our brothers get a message from FedEx saying we tried to deliver, but your doc at 30 was closed.

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.099
Well here's what happened.

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:05.099
Our brothers called our purchasing agent who was out in service in the walker area.

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:11.099
At 1045 he called the company in Texas, who just happened to be open for a couple hours at Saturday morning.

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:13.099
At 11, the company called FedEx.

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:23.100
At 1115 FedEx, called to say the cameras would be delivered back to our distribution center here in Red Hook, Brooklyn at 130 that afternoon.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.100
So at 130 we had a van at FedEx.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:33.100
We picked up the three cameras and controllers that allegedly were not available anywhere in the United States and Japan.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.100
They were ready for installation on the due date July 22nd.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.100
Then our brothers get a blessing.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.100
You be the judge.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:48.100
But we can say without doubt that an angel did help us fabricate that beautiful studio.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:56.100
And we say that because the brother who donated all the materials and labor, his first name is angel.
