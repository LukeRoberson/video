00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:09.429
On June 6, 2007, the governing body made a decision to encourage all of us to have our

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:12.750
own personal study Bible.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.070
And as a result of that decision, it was decided that we would look into the possibility

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:25.710
of producing a large Bible, the regular Bible, with larger or wider margins.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.269
And in that way, it would help us to be able to have plenty of space to write in our study

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.269
notes.

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:37.909
However, in the process of preparing this study Bible, it became obvious that there was

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:42.789
also a need to revise the actual text of the New World Translation.

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:48.829
So the study Bible project was put on hold for a while until the revised text was available.

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.310
And of course, we all remember the release of the revised New World Translation at the

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.270
annual meeting in 2013.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.229
Two years later, an announcement was made at the annual meeting that a new online study

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:08.590
Bible would start to be released gradually, starting with the Book of Matthew.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:16.430
And in the two years since that time, we've gradually had Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:24.109
But why does it take so long to prepare this study Bible?

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:28.390
Well the simple answer is because of the amount of work involved.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.590
To give you some idea of how much work, let's look at some statistics.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.430
The four gospels have approximately 2,300 study notes.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.829
That's about the same amount of words as are used in 115 study articles in the Watchtower.

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:51.870
In other words, this is the equivalent of more than two years of study material.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:57.709
For another way of expressing it is, each gospel has study notes that equal the amount

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:03.069
of information that's found in a 192 page book.

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:10.469
Along with that, 130 images have been prepared for the image gallery, as well as 11 videos,

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:14.629
in addition to the introduction videos for each Bible book.

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:18.750
We also have a whole new section added to the appendix.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.789
It's a Pendix C.

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:26.550
We find therein for the first time ever documented reasons as to why the New World Transition

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.669
Committee restored the divine name in the Christian Greek scriptures, showing the support

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:33.870
for each occurrence.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:41.349
The list of J references that support these decisions has been increased from 28 to 92,

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.150
and the list continues to grow.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.990
But from where do we get the material for the study notes?

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:54.030
Study notes are based on the inside volumes, the reference Bible, and Watchtower comments.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.110
Additionally, suggestions have been received from mature witnesses who have developed their

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.189
own study notes.

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:06.270
These include some of the notes from brothers who serve as Gilead Instructors.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.870
So when we read the study notes, it's as if we are seeing a concise summary of what

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.229
we might find when we search the references in the Watchtower publication index, plus

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.830
more.

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.550
What can we look forward to in the future?

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.509
We are planning to release the Book of Acts in 2018.

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:33.469
Later in the year, a new section entitled, Scriptures for Christian Living will be released.

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:38.909
This material is based on the older publication, make sure of all things.

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:44.389
It provides a list of questions and scriptures that will be useful during shepherding visits,

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:50.020
and when we want to find scriptures that help us with daily living.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.419
So we hope that this has given us some ideas to why it takes so long for these extra books

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:56.740
to be added.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:02.719
The good news is there's only 66 books in the Bible.

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:07.680
Well this morning we're pleased to announce that there are two new videos that are being

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.120
made available to help us to maximize our use of the online study Bible.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:21.250
So we'd like to give you a preview of these two videos now.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:28.250

After he had fasted for 40 days and 40 nights, he felt hungry.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:31.120
With a tempter approached and said to him, the Gems tab of the study pane lists the study

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.600

account.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:23.040
Or it may be a general reference to a person, place, teaching, or prophecy in the verse

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:30.490
you are reading.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:35.610
Click the marginal references icon to see all the marginal references for the chapter grouped

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.529

Parallel accounts are listed first.

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:45.680

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:08.779
word or phrase.

00:08:08.779 --> 00:08:15.579
If a study note refers to an appendix article, click the link to open the article.

00:08:15.579 --> 00:08:19.620
Some appendix articles have a text and a picture version.

Use the view buttons to switch between the two versions.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.259

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:27.190
Others are silent.

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:50.940
Close the media gallery to go back to the Bible chapter you are reading.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:55.379
We're sure that these two videos will help us to get the most benefit we can from the

00:09:55.379 --> 00:09:57.299
online study Bible.

00:09:57.299 --> 00:10:02.259
But we also have an exciting announcement to make this morning.

00:10:02.259 --> 00:10:08.179
Some of you, if you stayed up late last night or if you got up really early this morning,

00:10:08.179 --> 00:10:10.220
perhaps already know this.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:18.019
But this morning we have a new version of JW Library that's available and it now includes

00:10:18.019 --> 00:10:32.259
the study Bible.

00:10:32.259 --> 00:10:37.580
If you haven't got that update, after morning worship finishes, you may want to visit

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:41.500
the App Store and make sure you have the latest version.

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:48.019
When you install this version of JW Library for the first time, it is going to take all

00:10:48.019 --> 00:10:53.179
your study notes that you have your personal study notes from the New World Translation

00:10:53.179 --> 00:10:57.259
and transfer them into the new study Bible.

00:10:57.259 --> 00:11:02.500
So in that way, you have all your personal notes along with the study Bible notes in the

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:03.940
one place.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:07.059
It doesn't get much easier, does it?

00:11:07.059 --> 00:11:12.580
Well, Major Hover bless our personal study projects as we continue to dig deeply into

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.080
God's Word.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:21.860
And may this study Bible help us to do what Psalm 1931 says, namely, to be determined to

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:24.100
cling to Jehovah's Reminders.
