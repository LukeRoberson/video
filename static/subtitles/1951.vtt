00:00:04.209 --> 00:00:08.210
Who is the author of the Bible?

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:14.210
The Bible is a collection of 66 small books.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:24.730
Over 3,500 years ago, Moses began writing the first of those books.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:33.359
During the next 1,600 years, some 40 different men wrote the remaining books that make up the Bible.

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:39.359
If men wrote the text, why is the Bible called the Word of God?

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:42.359
Consider this.

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:50.359
When a businessman wants to send an important message, he might use a secretary to write a letter or an email.

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:55.700
The employer tells his secretary the thoughts he wants to convey.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.700
And the secretary compiles those thoughts into the email.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.700
Although the secretary types the email, he is not the author.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.700
In a similar way, the Bible writers express thoughts and feelings in their own style,

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.700
but the message did not originate with them.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.700
So where did it come from?

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.700
The Bible says all scripture is inspired of God.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.700
Jehovah God used his power to guide their minds, transmitting his thoughts to them.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.700
How did he do this?

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.700
While the prophet Daniel was asleep, Jehovah caused him to have dreams.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:46.290
Others, like the prophet Ezekiel, were awake when God caused them to see incredible visions.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.290
Sometimes, Jehovah used angels to communicate his thoughts, such as when he spoke with the Apostle John.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.290
But could Jehovah God really transmit his message in these ways?

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:11.240
Today, people can communicate their thoughts over great distances.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:21.650
They can even communicate with astronauts in outer space.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:28.650
If humans can do this, is it not reasonable to conclude that their creator can do far more?

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:42.479
We can trust the Bible, because it was authored not by man, but by our loving creator, Jehovah God.

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:47.479
You may wonder, why read the Bible?

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:50.479
How can you start reading the Bible?

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:53.479
Has the Bible been changed or tampered with?

00:02:53.479 --> 00:03:04.889
