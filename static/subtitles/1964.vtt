00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:11.869
We sincerely congratulate Dr. B on having completed a task that was perhaps never before accomplished

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:20.109
by a single individual, namely a corrected Hebrew text of the Old Testament and a revised

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.109
English version of the whole Bible.

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:29.870
Benjamin Boothroyd was born in 1768 to a humble shoemaker.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.429
He lived his whole life in Yorkshire, England.

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:40.149
Boothroyd wasn't wealthy or prominent, yet he accomplished something remarkable in the field

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:43.829
of Bible translation.

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.869
As a young man, Boothroyd and his friends would attend church and then go to a local

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:54.270
ale house, not dissimilar to this one.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.789
It was on one of these occasions the Boothroyd experienced something that changed his life.

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:07.230
The conversation was unusually profane and simple in which I joined and was perhaps worse

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.950
than any of my companions.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.909
With a suddenness of almost a flash of lightning, my mind was struck with horror under a sense

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:23.829
of my sin and guilt that I was a suitable victim for the miseries of hell.

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:33.319
Without saying a word, Boothroyd left the ale house and his companions behind.

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:41.400
As he walked home, he got down on his knees and begged God to have mercy on him.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.239
It was a pivotal moment.

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:49.859
He resolved to dedicate the rest of his life to God.

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:54.900
We're here at the National Library of Wales to reveal the next chapter of Boothroyd's

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:03.450
story.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:10.810
In 1801, Boothroyd married Sarah Hurst who shared his devotion and faith.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.969
To supplement their income, a couple ran a small bookshop and printery.

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:20.930
It was there, Boothroyd acquired these books.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.490
Lectures on the sacred poetry of the Hebrews.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.849
Those lectures on the Hebrew poetry fell into my hands.

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.889
I read it with peculiar pleasure.

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:36.729
Boothroyd fell in love with the Hebrew language.

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:40.610
He decided to learn it, but how?

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:47.330
He noticed that some of the Psalms were split into standards using different Hebrew letters.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.530
The names of the letters I learned from the 119th Psalm and I began to read the early part

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.330
of the Pentateuch.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:03.009
He painstakingly taught himself Hebrew letters, then words, then grammar, until he could

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:06.780
read the Bible in Hebrew.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.979
Uncomparing the latest Hebrew printed texts, such as these by Benjamin Kennycott, with

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:19.219
older available manuscripts, Boothroyd discovered something troubling.

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:22.139
It had many errors.

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:26.180
This led him to a monumental decision.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.340
Boothroyd began a project to compile and publish a more accurate Hebrew text of the

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.139
Old Testament.

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:40.939
While he did the majority of the work, he wasn't alone.

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:46.139
My wife learned the names of the Hebrew letters, and we examined the sheets, not by uttering

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:51.300
words, but by pronouncing letter by letter.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:57.060
Sarah helped her husband proofread the work to confirm the accuracy.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:03.819
After years of meticulous work, they completed Boothroyd's Bibliah Brecher in two

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:07.139
volumes in 1816.

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:11.900
Many would consider such an accomplishment to be the achievement of a lifetime.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:18.139
But Boothroyd was about to begin another major undertaking.

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:26.379
Boothroyd felt it was his duty to produce a revised Bible in plain English, a Bible that

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:28.660
anyone could understand.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:36.420
So with the knowledge, materials, and means available to him, he went back to work.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:45.509
We're now at the University in Lampeter to find out what Boothroyd accomplished.

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:53.509
Just two years later, in 1818, he published the first volume of a new family Bible.

00:04:53.509 --> 00:05:00.509
The second volume was completed in 1821, and by 1824, the entire English translation

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:02.990
was released.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.230
Once again, he hadn't accomplished this on his own.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:13.829
Through the whole of this important and laborious work, Mrs. Boothroyd was my chief support

00:05:13.829 --> 00:05:19.470
and assistant, and to her, the public are as much indebted as myself.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:26.389
A new family Bible was appreciated by scholars and faithful Bible readers alike.

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:31.509
One thing in particular made Boothroyd's Bible especially significant.

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:34.389
Boothroyd followed this rule while translating.

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:40.670
I have adopted Jehovah instead of Lord, and Jehovah God is certainly more proper and

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:45.110
just to the original than Lord God.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:52.470
This was the first English Bible ever published to consistently use Jehovah in the Old Testament.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:58.829
A Boothroyd also included it several times in the New Testament.

00:05:58.829 --> 00:06:05.389
The University of Glasgow awarded Boothroyd a degree in recognition of this outstanding

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:07.790
piece of scholarship.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:13.870
His new family Bible was later used as the basis for translating the Bible into languages

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.990
of the South Pacific, such as Tahisha.

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:27.480
As a result, these two used Jehovah's name extensively.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:33.279
Even what was available to him, Boothroyd peered into the Scriptures, seeking to know

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:39.759
their meaning, and then worked to share that knowledge with others.

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:46.490
In his dedication to his new family Bible, he wrote,

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:52.089
I have no interest to serve, but that of truth.

00:06:52.089 --> 00:06:57.170
This man of lowly origins achieved something truly rare.

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:03.889
This works gave people knowledge of God's word, God's will, and God's name.
