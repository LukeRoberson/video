00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:09.419
Please watch the following video that contains heartfelt comments from persecuted brothers and sisters in Russia

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:15.419
and see why we have no reason to fear persecution.

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:26.539
I was horrified when several masked officers broke down two doors and burst into the home where the meeting was being held.

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.539
Everything happened at once, loud sounds, noise, the order, everyone sit on the floor.

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:45.729
I was overcome with fear when they put me in handcuffs, placed me in the police van and took me to jail.

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:52.729
I was afraid because I didn't know how long I would be there and what was awaiting me.

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:59.729
When I was being interrogated, I was afraid that I might be unfaithful to Jehovah and let my brothers down.

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:10.730
After being detained, I was mostly afraid about what I would face in prison, who my would encounter, how to act, how others would treat me, the unknown.

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:27.459
When one of the officers began to describe how bad life is behind bars, I imagined that behind the officer stood an angel just like the one who supported Daniel in the illustration.

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:33.459
This helped me to calm down, not panic or be afraid. That's how Jehovah supported me.

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:45.189
At the first court appearance, when I was brought out, the broadest feelings impelled them to show supports on how, and they began implaning.

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.189
How that encouraged me that they were with me.

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.189
I was proud to succeed.

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.189
Fervent and sincere prayers that Jehovah helped me to cope with these fears.

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.189
Isaiah 30-15 gave me much support.

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.189
I realized that tranquility and trust in Jehovah are now the most important things.

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.189
Understanding this made things much easier for me.

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:19.189
We took the elevator down to the first floor, the doors open, and there stood a large crowd of our brothers and sisters, and they all began clapping.

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:27.189
When I saw that, my emotions just welled up, and I got a lump in my throat.

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:34.189
I felt as if I had wings. I felt the great cloud of witnesses.

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:43.189
I prayed to Jehovah for calmness, courage, and wisdom, and that he helped me not to bring reproach on his holy name.

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:49.189
Almost immediately, the peace of God came over me, and I was calm.

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:55.189
The unpleasant sensations did not go away, but I was no longer afraid.

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.569
While overcoming our fear, my wife and I try to go out and service every day.

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.569
When you don't concentrate on yourself, but focus on helping others, fear disappears.

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.099
Something that helped me to cope with my fears is hope.

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:21.099
Looking at the situation through Jehovah's eyes, seeing what will happen next.

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:28.099
That this is not the end of the situation, but only a difficult phase through which you can pass.

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:39.669
I was helped to cope with my fear by the words of the song. Take one day at a time, leave tomorrow until tomorrow. Peace is what I find.

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:47.669
I understood that it was important to solve problems as they came up, and not to be troubled by what might never happen.

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:57.669
Fear is interesting. That is, in principle, fear can be inside a person, and if someone is afraid, that is not shameful.

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:07.669
But the question is, can you overcome this fear? Can you get the fear under your control? Can you overcome the surge of negativity?

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:14.669
And when my heart persuaded me to get scared, then I started to pray.

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:21.670
I prayed to Jehovah to give me courage and not be afraid of anyone or anything.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:28.670
I still say to myself, Felix, do not fear anybody or anything except Jehovah.

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:49.839
I will do that forever.
