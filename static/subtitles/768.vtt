00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:10.060
Well, now we come to the true highlight of our Gilead graduation program, a talk by a

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.820
member of the governing body, Brother Stephen Lett.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.940
You know, 33 years ago, when I attended ministerial training school, Brother Lett was one of

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:26.910
my instructors, and I've been learning from him ever since.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:34.390
His theme for us today is imitate the great teacher.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:42.579
I don't believe a word of it.

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:48.939
During his earthly ministry, Jesus expelled demons.

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:51.340
He healed the sick.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.659
He fed multitudes.

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:56.899
He even raised the dead.

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:07.340
But was he known as the great demon expeller, the great healer, the great feeder of multitudes,

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.780
or the great resurrector?

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.099
No.

00:01:11.099 --> 00:01:15.420
But he was known as the great teacher.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.019
Why?

00:01:17.019 --> 00:01:23.060
Because he focused primarily his efforts on the preaching and teaching work.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.299
But now, why did he do this?

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:32.620
Well, he knew physical miracles would only bring temporary benefits.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:40.459
He knew once freed from the demons, ones that were healed, fed, even resurrected, would

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:43.900
eventually grow old and die.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.140
So how could he help people permanently?

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:55.219
Well, he knew only he could do it by teaching them the life-saving knowledge about his

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.299
father, Jehovah.

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:03.700
He well knew the truthfulness of what he stated as recorded at John 173.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.659
This means everlasting life.

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:13.860
They're coming to know the only true God and of the one he sent, Jesus Christ.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:22.379
So even though he did many amazing things, he focused primarily on the preaching and teaching

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:27.939
work, becoming the greatest teacher ever to walk this earth.

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:33.539
In fact, when officers were sent to arrest him, remember what happened?

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:35.340
They came back empty handed.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.500
Why?

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:43.460
Well, they said, never has any man spoken like this.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.379
They were so awestruck by his teaching.

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.740
They couldn't even bring themselves to arrest him.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:56.740
Large crowds would stick with him for days, even without eating, in order to listen to

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.460
his teaching.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:06.979
In contrast to the quality of Jesus' teaching, Acts 20 tells us about the Apostle Paul

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:10.740
giving a long, long talk.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:19.259
And during that talk, rumor, the young man Uticus sank into a deep, deep sleep.

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:22.939
And even fell out of the third story window of a building.

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:30.060
Now of course, Paul resurrected him, but probably he felt responsible for putting him to sleep

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.129
like that.

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:39.289
But no offense to Paul, I'm sure he was doing the best he could.

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:44.729
But obviously his teaching was not on a par with that of the great teacher.

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:47.490
And that makes me think of what a brother said to me in a teasing way.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:52.009
He said, Brother let, I always look forward to your talks.

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:58.289
I know I'm going to wake up totally refreshed.

00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:06.409
Well, it's really true none of us, like Paul, can begin to match the quality of teaching

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:08.330
of the great teacher.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.930
But what are we told at first Peter 221?

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.329
We are told to follow his steps closely.

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.370
We can't do it perfectly.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.009
But we're told to do it as closely as we can.

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:26.930
So that means that all of us, but especially as we're talking to you dear Gilead students

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:35.050
soon to be graduates, you must make the preaching and teaching work a priority.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.850
And we must do our best.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.129
You must do your best to improve in your teaching.

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:45.730
And how can you do that by imitating the great teacher?

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.930
Using this talk, even though much of what we will talk about will concern the public

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.850
ministry, what we're going to discuss, much of it would be applicable to teaching on a

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.050
personal level and in the congregation.

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:08.050
So especially you brothers, but all of us, we want to imitate Jesus teaching methods

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.610
as we shepherd Jehovah sheep on a personal level.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.649
And as we do so on a congregational level from the platform.

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:23.769
Now here's a question, how did Jesus become the great teacher?

00:05:23.769 --> 00:05:31.410
Well, the Bible tells us that for eons and eons of time, as a master worker beside the

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:37.009
Jehovah, he carefully observed and he imitated his father.

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:41.129
And he thereby acquired amazing teaching skills.

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:44.329
See, he learned from the greatest teacher.

00:05:44.329 --> 00:05:46.850
And no wonder he became the great teacher.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.329
He learned from his heavenly father.

00:05:49.329 --> 00:05:53.009
And he appropriately gave credit where it belonged.

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:56.810
A go to John chapter 8, please.

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:02.930
And notice how he gave the credit for his speaking and teaching where it belonged.

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:10.769
John 8, the be part of verse 28, I do nothing of my own initiative.

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:16.569
But just as a father taught me, I speak these things.

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:19.649
Yes, he imitated his father.

00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:22.449
Now we want to imitate him.

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:27.329
But what specific teaching methods did he utilize?

00:06:27.329 --> 00:06:29.170
Did he learn from the greatest teacher?

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.410
Well, let's discuss four.

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:38.610
Now one, he taught with enthusiasm and conviction.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:47.170
He used 729 for he was teaching them as a person having authority and not as there's

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:48.170
scribes.

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:52.730
So did not indicate enthusiasm, conviction, authority, he taught.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:59.850
So if we're not enthusiastic about what we teach in the ministry or from the platform,

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:04.569
how can we expect our listeners to be enthusiastic about it?

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:09.170
So never would we want to come across half-hearted in our teaching.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:15.689
Just like enthusiastic teaching is contagious, half-hearted teaching is contagious too, isn't

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:16.689
it?

00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:19.129
You could perhaps liken it to yawning.

00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:23.370
The one person yawning in a room pretty soon everybody's yawning.

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.970
And that could be the way with half-hearted teaching.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:31.889
But as a caution, we don't want to be theatrical in our speaking.

00:07:31.889 --> 00:07:40.970
That means we wouldn't want to use extreme gestures or dramatic expressions, overly theatrical,

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:42.209
even theatrical.

00:07:42.209 --> 00:07:43.689
Why?

00:07:43.689 --> 00:07:47.009
Because now you end up drawing attention to yourself, don't you?

00:07:47.009 --> 00:07:48.769
Rather than to what we're teaching.

00:07:48.769 --> 00:07:52.410
And that's emphasis in the wrong place, isn't it?

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:57.370
But now let's talk about a second method, the great teacher utilized.

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:00.050
He was a good listener.

00:08:00.089 --> 00:08:04.329
How did he learn this pattern of being a good listener?

00:08:04.329 --> 00:08:08.569
We'll open up to Isaiah chapter 50, please.

00:08:08.569 --> 00:08:15.850
And notice what it's prophetically said about Jesus and where he learned to be a good listener.

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:21.689
Notice chapter 50 and right at the end of verse 4, let's begin there.

00:08:21.689 --> 00:08:29.170
He, Jehovah, awakens my ear to listen like the taught ones.

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:34.529
The sovereign Lord Jehovah has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious.

00:08:34.529 --> 00:08:37.970
I did not turn in the opposite direction.

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:43.929
So Jehovah opened his ear, trained in to be a good listener, and he responded well.

00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:44.929
Did he?

00:08:44.929 --> 00:08:45.929
Not.

00:08:45.929 --> 00:08:53.250
And that's why when he became a human, from childhood on, he continued his pattern of being

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:54.649
a good listener, didn't he?

00:08:54.649 --> 00:08:57.889
You recall the account in Luke chapter 2.

00:08:57.929 --> 00:09:03.490
And Joseph and Mary finally found Jesus after three days, and he was only 12 years old.

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:04.809
Where do they find him?

00:09:04.809 --> 00:09:11.850
It says he was sitting in the midst of the teachers there in the temple and listening to them.

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:15.289
And then also asking them questions.

00:09:15.289 --> 00:09:21.409
Then when he began his career as a disciple maker, at 30, it was second nature, wasn't it,

00:09:21.409 --> 00:09:23.129
to be a good listener.

00:09:23.129 --> 00:09:24.929
Now think of this.

00:09:24.929 --> 00:09:31.210
You know, he had more to say than any other human has ever had to say.

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:38.769
He knew the value of pausing, drawing out his audience, and then really listening to

00:09:38.769 --> 00:09:39.929
them.

00:09:39.929 --> 00:09:44.570
And the same is true with us, see, you may think, especially after Gilead school, you've

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:46.769
got a lot to say.

00:09:46.769 --> 00:09:52.690
But if you're going to imitate the great teacher, we have to use self-control, we have to pause

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:56.850
and draw people out, and then really listen to them.

00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:02.409
And when we serve as an assistant, which sometimes is half the time, we want to be active

00:10:02.409 --> 00:10:03.409
listeners.

00:10:03.409 --> 00:10:06.370
See, what does that mean to be an active listener?

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:13.529
Well, maybe you would nod periodically in agreement, or maybe you would add some little

00:10:13.529 --> 00:10:16.529
comment, well, it's very interesting.

00:10:16.529 --> 00:10:19.169
You might even ask for clarification.

00:10:19.169 --> 00:10:23.330
People like to clarify what they're saying, say, shows you're really interested in what's

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:24.330
happening.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:29.970
So whether we're the one presenting or the one as an assistant, we want to be an active

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:30.970
listener.

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:36.490
There's probably nothing more distracting than having you're an assistant playing with

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:42.009
a dog, or maybe looking down the street, see what's happening down the street, pretty

00:10:42.009 --> 00:10:48.350
soon your household is looking down the street, see what's happening, see, be an active

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:49.350
listener.

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:53.870
Well, let's get our third method, the great teacher used.

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:57.669
He used thought-provoking questions.

00:10:57.669 --> 00:10:59.990
And methods two and three do go hand-to-hand, don't they?

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:06.110
Because if you ask good questions, you're likely going to have more to listen to.

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:12.870
But what if some of Jehovah's people tend to shy away, perhaps from using questions?

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:17.350
What do they just like to present information, a kind of control, everything?

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:22.269
Well, if you think about it, it's probably easier just to present information, even though

00:11:22.269 --> 00:11:24.269
not nearly as effective.

00:11:24.269 --> 00:11:31.029
See, when you ask questions and then you get a response from the householder, it's

00:11:31.029 --> 00:11:33.509
kind of like bouncing a football.

00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:38.870
Now, you bounce a basketball is predictable, not a football.

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:44.590
And the same way, people come back with all kinds of responses and you've got to be willing

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:47.830
and able to adapt according to their responses.

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:51.750
Some don't like that uncertainty, so they would rather just present information.

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:58.190
But as we said, that's not going to be nearly as effective as those who have learned to imitate

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:04.110
the great teacher and effectively teach with questions.

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:10.149
Now you, Gilea's students, have certainly seen the value of good questions during class.

00:12:10.149 --> 00:12:13.990
See, it made it so much more enjoyable, didn't it?

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:20.429
It enhanced your learning tremendously when your instructors use these good questions.

00:12:20.429 --> 00:12:25.629
Why is that more effective to proficiently use questions?

00:12:25.629 --> 00:12:31.389
Well, for one thing, you involve your listener in the conversation.

00:12:31.389 --> 00:12:36.950
And what do you enjoy more being given a sermon or being involved in a conversation?

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:38.309
Answer is obviously that.

00:12:38.309 --> 00:12:41.230
So you involve the listener more enjoyable.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:46.750
Another thing, you gain valuable information about your listener, which you can use to

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:48.590
really help that one.

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:52.509
Well, what are types of questions we can use?

00:12:52.509 --> 00:12:55.710
You can use what do you think questions?

00:12:55.710 --> 00:13:03.990
Jesus used them as an example, Matthew 1812, what do you think?

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:08.470
If a man has 100 sheep, one sprays, we know the rest of the illustration, but he started

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:09.669
out, what do you think?

00:13:09.909 --> 00:13:13.070
People generally like to give their opinion.

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:15.830
And in a sense, there's no wrong answer, is there?

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:18.990
Because whatever they say, that's what they think.

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:20.909
That's what you ask for, right?

00:13:20.909 --> 00:13:22.429
You ask, what do you think?

00:13:22.429 --> 00:13:27.149
And people like to give their opinion, it makes it enjoyable.

00:13:27.149 --> 00:13:31.509
You can also use multiple choice questions.

00:13:31.509 --> 00:13:36.230
That sometimes makes it easier for the householder to answer.

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:40.549
Jesus gave an example in Matthew 1725.

00:13:40.549 --> 00:13:48.750
He said, Simon, from whom do the kings of the earth receive duties or headtax?

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:52.470
From their sons or from the strangers?

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:56.629
Many of our tracks use multiple choice questions, don't they?

00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:59.309
And we can effectively use those.

00:13:59.309 --> 00:14:06.190
And if you think about it, the right question can often enable us to overcome potential

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:09.669
conversation stoppers and keep the conversation going.

00:14:09.669 --> 00:14:15.549
For example, if a person says, you people don't believe in Jesus, we might say, well, may

00:14:15.549 --> 00:14:19.870
I please ask, what do you say that?

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:22.909
Did someone tell you that about us?

00:14:22.909 --> 00:14:28.309
See, harmless questions can keep that conversation going until you get valuable information

00:14:28.309 --> 00:14:30.750
that perhaps you can use to help the person.

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:34.230
Person says, I don't believe in the Bible.

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:38.070
May I please ask, why you feel that way?

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:42.149
May I ask, how long have you felt that way?

00:14:42.149 --> 00:14:43.470
See, keep it going.

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:49.149
One brother said during Pioneer's School, he had those questions drilled into his head

00:14:49.149 --> 00:14:52.269
about, why don't you feel that way, how long have you felt that way?

00:14:52.269 --> 00:14:56.470
A woman came to the door, said, I can't talk him pregnant.

00:14:56.470 --> 00:15:02.559
And he says, well, may I ask, how long you felt that way?

00:15:02.559 --> 00:15:05.409
Don't do that.

00:15:05.409 --> 00:15:09.620
We said before, you got to be a good listener.

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:16.539
But then, what about using thought-provoking questions when conducting a Bible study?

00:15:16.539 --> 00:15:23.500
As you well know, our new study book is loaded with thought-provoking questions, isn't?

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.220
And we certainly want to fully utilize them.

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:31.419
But occasionally, we may need to add auxiliary questions.

00:15:31.419 --> 00:15:36.779
But remember, most of what a good teacher says during a Bible study is in the form of

00:15:36.779 --> 00:15:38.259
questions.

00:15:38.259 --> 00:15:44.700
I know myself, I've really tried hard to train myself when I'm about ready to make a statement,

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:51.220
say something, wait a minute, let me change that, let me change it to a question, and

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:55.740
let me draw out from the student what I was about to say.

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:59.100
See, that's going to be more effective, isn't it?

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:07.179
It's normally much better than explaining a scripture to a student, having the student

00:16:07.179 --> 00:16:09.179
explain it to you.

00:16:09.179 --> 00:16:12.500
And don't be afraid of a little silence.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:17.899
See, if you ask a question and they're silence, some of us think, well, we have to quickly

00:16:17.899 --> 00:16:20.500
fill in the gap by saying something.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:24.179
But if they're thinking, let them think.

00:16:24.179 --> 00:16:26.539
Of course you have to know your student.

00:16:26.539 --> 00:16:32.820
If they have no clue what the answer is, then don't let them just sit there and sizzle.

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:38.139
Throw them a rope, throw them an auxiliary question.

00:16:38.139 --> 00:16:43.940
But now we're going to go to our fourth method that the great teacher learned from the greatest

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:49.620
teacher, he effectively used illustrations.

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:53.820
And that was certainly a powerful teaching tool, indeed.

00:16:53.820 --> 00:17:01.299
Matthew 1334, without an illustration, Jesus would not speak.

00:17:01.299 --> 00:17:03.419
But here's a question.

00:17:03.419 --> 00:17:09.539
Do you think that Jesus illustrations were the product of spur of the moment thinking?

00:17:09.539 --> 00:17:11.339
Well, there's no doubt about it.

00:17:11.339 --> 00:17:15.420
His perfect brain certainly helped to be able to come up with amazing illustrations.

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:22.660
But nevertheless, the indication is that he cultivated the ability to effectively use

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:23.740
illustrations.

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:29.940
If he saw a shepherd, for example, taking care of a sheep, he likely meditated.

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:35.180
Now how can I use this situation to teach vital truths?

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:40.619
He did the same when he saw, for example, a fisherman letting down his nets, a farmer

00:17:40.619 --> 00:17:49.980
sewing seed, maybe builders constructing a tower, see, how can I use this and make powerful

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:53.299
illustrations to teach vital truths?

00:17:53.299 --> 00:18:02.700
Even simple items, like birds, lilies, a lamp on a lampstand, a wine-skin, leaven, mustard

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:05.619
seed, salt, the young child.

00:18:05.619 --> 00:18:10.380
How can I use these simple items to teach vital truths?

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:13.339
And he was amazing how he did that.

00:18:13.339 --> 00:18:18.460
And the same is true with us, see, all around us, if we train ourselves to think that way.

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:25.339
There are circumstances, there are situations, there are even just items that we can use

00:18:25.339 --> 00:18:31.099
and make them into powerful illustrations, and we can powerfully elevate the quality

00:18:31.099 --> 00:18:32.099
of our teaching.

00:18:32.099 --> 00:18:33.980
Now here's an example.

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:39.220
Sometime ago, a brother noticed a little baby with a pacifier.

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:44.140
This pacifier had been dipped in sugar water, put in the baby's mouth, and he was thinking,

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:50.859
you know, that's a very good illustration of many, many in Christendom.

00:18:50.859 --> 00:18:53.619
They're satisfied what they have.

00:18:53.619 --> 00:19:01.380
Even though they have no real spiritual nourishment, but we're looking for those who are not satisfied,

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:06.859
those who are conscious of their spiritual need, and he was able to use that in a talk.

00:19:06.859 --> 00:19:10.259
What are cautions regarding the use of illustrations?

00:19:10.259 --> 00:19:12.420
Well, here's just a couple.

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:17.500
And illustrations should not be too long or complicated.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:21.940
If it is, simplify it or discard it.

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:24.579
That's what the school guidebook tells us.

00:19:24.579 --> 00:19:26.700
Here's another caution.

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:35.220
To be effective, the illustration must be familiar to and fit your audience.

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:41.619
For example, what if you use the illustration, Satan's system is like a male platypus.

00:19:42.619 --> 00:19:46.700
Now, in some parts of Australia, that might be a good illustration.

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:50.740
Because they know a male platypus looks harmless.

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:58.140
He looks innocent, but his fine legs are armed with ankle spurs, connected to venom glands.

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:02.140
So he looks harmless, but he could be very dangerous.

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:08.180
But that only works, see, if you're dealing with people that are familiar with that particular animal.

00:20:08.259 --> 00:20:14.500
But skillfully selected and used illustrations are very effective.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:19.500
They stimulate thinking, they arrest and hold attention,

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:23.180
they motivate the heart and conscience of our listener,

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:26.339
and they serve as powerful memory aids.

00:20:26.339 --> 00:20:31.380
See, a good illustration is going to be remembered years later along with,

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:38.140
and this is an important thing, along with a point that it was designed to highlight.

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:43.819
Well, there we have four teaching methods utilized by the great teacher,

00:20:43.819 --> 00:20:47.299
that he learned from the greatest teacher, as we said.

00:20:47.299 --> 00:20:52.339
And we want to do our best to copy, imitate his way of teaching.

00:20:52.339 --> 00:20:56.940
And I know you, Gilly of students, you have an enhanced desire to do that.

00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:03.700
In the congregation and also in your territory that you're going to be working in.

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:09.819
So let's work hard to teach with enthusiasm and conviction.

00:21:09.819 --> 00:21:12.940
Let's be a good listener.

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:16.059
Let's use thought provoking questions.

00:21:16.059 --> 00:21:19.859
And let's use effective illustrations.

00:21:19.859 --> 00:21:26.579
If you work hard, your dear students almost graduates to employ the same teaching techniques,

00:21:26.579 --> 00:21:32.579
then you're going to be a lot more skillful in reaching the hearts of your listeners.

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:34.819
And there's a lot of stake, isn't it?

00:21:34.819 --> 00:21:35.940
I mean, you think about it.

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:39.180
The lives of our brothers and sisters are at stake.

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:43.140
And with the art of teaching learned from the great teacher,

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:48.380
we want to help as many of them as we can to make it into that new world.

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:52.980
And then also the lives of honest, arted ones in our territory.

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.579
They hang in the balance, don't they?

00:21:55.579 --> 00:21:59.460
So we want to find them before it's too late.

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:03.220
And using the art of teaching learned from the great teacher,

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:10.220
we want to motivate them to come into this safety of Jehovah's organization.

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:14.259
And if you think about it, it's good to remember that what we're doing now

00:22:14.259 --> 00:22:19.180
in the way of learning to teach is really preparing us

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:24.700
for the greatest teaching campaign ever in all human history,

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:29.660
the teaching of billions who will be coming back in the resurrection.

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:32.740
You could say, our work now is like a warm-up, isn't it?

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:36.940
It's a warm-up for that greatest teaching campaign

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:40.619
that is just around the corner.

00:22:40.619 --> 00:22:46.339
So please continue to observe carefully the teaching of the great teacher.

00:22:46.339 --> 00:22:49.339
And you learn a lot about that in school, no doubt about it.

00:22:49.339 --> 00:22:54.299
And make Jehovah continue to bless you most, be loved.

00:22:54.299 --> 00:22:58.059
Gilead students, almost graduates, may he bless you

00:22:58.059 --> 00:23:03.779
as you apply all the wonderful things you've learned during this school.

00:23:03.779 --> 00:23:12.599
And that includes learning to imitate the great teacher.

00:23:12.599 --> 00:23:15.640
Well, we sincerely thank you, Brother Lett,

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:20.000
for those very practical comments about learning to be a good teacher.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:26.920
It was very, very much appreciated.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:30.400
Well, now's the time for us to present the diplomas

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:34.880
and Brother Kenneth Lodin, a helper to the teaching committee, is going to assist.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:40.529
He's going to do the hard part mentioning all the names.

The first couple here is Brother and Sister Agustino

00:23:43.529 --> 00:23:54.519
and they're going back to the Angola branch.

00:23:54.519 --> 00:23:59.079
We all miss this one.

going to the Spain branch.

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:16.849
Wonderful.

Congratulations.

and sadly he's not able to be with us today.

00:26:24.099 --> 00:26:27.059
But he will be getting his diploma, OK?

Congratulations.

He's going back to Tahiti.

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:12.279
What a beautiful class.

00:28:12.279 --> 00:28:22.440
And don't you think Brother Flodin did well with all of those names?

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:26.680
Well, it gives me very great pleasure to introduce you now

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:50.990
to the graduates of the 153rd class of Gilead.

00:28:50.990 --> 00:29:01.710
Brother Yani Kaupinen is going to read a letter from the class.

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:08.369
To the governing body, dear brothers.

00:29:08.369 --> 00:29:12.170
At the end of five memorable months,

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:18.130
we feel moved to echo the words of first John 4, 16.

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:23.609
We have come to know and believe the love that God has for us.

00:29:23.609 --> 00:29:28.009
One way we experience this love was by your fine example

00:29:28.009 --> 00:29:31.009
as it will us that your helpers.

00:29:31.009 --> 00:29:37.170
We did not expect and will never forget you sacrificing your precious time and energy

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:41.890
to provide us lectures, interviews and event tours.

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:51.470
As a result, we learnt first hand from your love, humility and burning zeal for Jehovah.

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:57.950
Our course of intensive Bible study has deepened our appreciation for the timely

00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:03.430
and upbuilding spiritual food available to all of God's people.

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:10.630
We are also deeply grateful to you for providing us with selfless and skillful instructors.

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:15.430
These gifts in men imparted their souls to us each day

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:22.589
and regularly made our hearts burn with appreciation.

00:30:22.589 --> 00:30:27.029
Carefully, considering the entire Bible chronologically,

00:30:27.069 --> 00:30:31.150
has given us a deeper understanding of how Jehovah thinks.

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:37.430
It has also increased our sensitivity to how he feels.

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:43.269
Our in-depth consideration of Jesus' ministry made us eyewitnesses to God's love

00:30:43.269 --> 00:30:46.750
being revealed through him.

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:50.589
We learnt that opposite of love is self-isness.

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:57.029
We can only show genuine unselfish concern for others with the help of Holy Spirit,

00:30:57.029 --> 00:31:03.829
such selfless love empowers us to bring out the best in ourselves and others.

00:31:03.829 --> 00:31:10.230
We experienced this in action through the warm hospitality and overwhelming kindness

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:17.910
shown by the United States' better family who abound in love for one another and for all.

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:26.609
This beautiful family has a permanent place in each of our hearts.

00:31:26.609 --> 00:31:31.890
Thank you for the priceless gift of Kileot training.

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:33.049
Excuse me.

00:31:33.049 --> 00:31:39.369
As we leave the Patterson, we are resolved to leave it by the words of 1 John for 11.

00:31:39.369 --> 00:31:48.099
If this is how God loved us, then we are also under obligation to love one another.

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:57.490
We are determined to never forget what we saw and heard.

00:31:57.490 --> 00:32:05.289
Kileot, excuse me, Kileot has enchanged our desire and ability to serve Jehovah

00:32:05.289 --> 00:32:13.130
and our brothers better each day, stabilizing Jehovah's organization one precious sheep at the time.

00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:18.680
We love you, dear brothers.

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:35.569
Your brothers and sisters, 153, Kileot, bless.

00:32:35.569 --> 00:32:45.210
Well, at the outset of our program, we discussed the initial reluctance of Gideon and Moses

00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:51.690
and Jeremiah and Brother Booth to accept assignments.

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:58.369
But in the final analysis, they all followed through and they did what Jehovah commissioned

00:32:58.369 --> 00:33:00.890
them to do.

00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:03.529
Well, we want to imitate them.

00:33:03.529 --> 00:33:10.650
We want to trust that if Jehovah is allowing us to serve, even if we might feel very, very

00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:20.890
inadequate, he sees something good in us and he'll make up for any lack that we feel.

00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:24.079
But here's a caution.

00:33:24.079 --> 00:33:26.799
Never go to the other extreme.

00:33:26.799 --> 00:33:35.640
Never become overconfident and step beyond the authority that you may be given.

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:39.880
Now in this regard, there's an interesting account that I want to just very briefly share

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:42.200
with you.

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:48.170
It's in 2 Kings, chapter 14.

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:51.329
2 Kings, chapter 14.

00:33:51.329 --> 00:33:58.650
Now as you're turning there, in this account, we read about King Amazaya of Judah.

00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:06.890
Now he had experienced a great victory over the Edomites and now he wanted to go to war

00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:09.250
against Israel.

00:34:09.250 --> 00:34:15.050
But King Jehoash sent him a few words of advice.

00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:19.250
And I wanted to just read these words, these few words, and especially draw attention to

00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:20.250
one sentence.

00:34:20.329 --> 00:34:21.730
So would you read it with me?

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:26.219
2 Kings 14 and verse 10.

00:34:26.219 --> 00:34:33.699
So he said, true, you have struck down Edom, so your heart has become arrogant.

00:34:33.699 --> 00:34:34.699
Now here's the point.

00:34:34.699 --> 00:34:38.099
Now here's the sentence I want you to draw attention to.

00:34:38.099 --> 00:34:42.820
Enjoy your glory, but stay in your own house.

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:45.380
Isn't that a great lie?

00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:48.179
I'm going to read it one more time.

00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:53.219
Enjoy your glory, but stay in your own house.

00:34:53.219 --> 00:34:59.739
Why should you provoke disaster and fall, bringing Judah down with you?

00:34:59.739 --> 00:35:00.980
Well what's the point?

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:04.219
You see, Jehoash said to Amazaya, enjoy the victory.

00:35:04.219 --> 00:35:11.340
Yeah, you want a victory, enjoy it, don't get a big head, don't push it, stay in your

00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:12.659
own house.

00:35:12.659 --> 00:35:16.619
Some Bible translations say stay at home.

00:35:16.619 --> 00:35:20.820
Well as it turned out, well you know you're Gilead graduates, you know how it turned

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:25.500
out, Amazaya did not listen to that advice.

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:32.820
He went on to fight against Israel, and as a result he suffered a humiliating defeat.

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:35.139
What's the lesson?

00:35:35.139 --> 00:35:40.219
You have had a wonderful spiritual victory today.

00:35:40.219 --> 00:35:46.579
This is no doubt going to be one of the happiest days of your entire life, graduating from

00:35:46.579 --> 00:35:48.739
Gilead school.

00:35:48.739 --> 00:35:51.300
Well it's right that you should enjoy this day.

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:58.579
You should find so much pleasure in it, and feel satisfaction in what you've accomplished.

00:35:58.579 --> 00:36:04.139
But as you experience this joy, and in the future as you experience the joy of taking

00:36:04.139 --> 00:36:12.300
on new assignments that will come to you, enjoy the moment, but stay in your place.

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:19.420
Never go beyond the limits of your responsibility or the authority that you've been given.

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:24.900
No assignment ever gives us the license for us to think that we are somehow superior

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:28.219
to our brothers or to act in that way.

00:36:28.219 --> 00:36:35.300
So you know that one of the qualities that Jehovah saw in all of you is your humility,

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:43.059
your ability to consider others as superior to you and to treat them in that way.

00:36:43.059 --> 00:36:47.340
Keep that quality and even strengthen it.

00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:54.940
You see some who disregarded cautions like this and who succumbed to pride have like Amazaya

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:59.179
eventually suffered a painful defeat.

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:07.219
So yes, this has been an especially happy day and you have many reasons to rejoice in it.

00:37:07.219 --> 00:37:14.340
But as you go and care for your respective assignments, remember to keep your place.

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:20.780
And then you'll have reason to rejoice not just on this day, your graduation day, but

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:29.340
every day as you carry out your ministry as the graduates of the 153rd class of Gilead.
