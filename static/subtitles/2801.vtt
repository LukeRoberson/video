00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.480
I'm going to get started right on this.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:08.990
OK.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.789
Excuse me.

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:13.789
Larry, Frank, have either of you seen Kevin tonight?

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:16.390
Yes, he's over by the literature counter.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.989
OK.

00:00:16.989 --> 00:00:17.989
I can go get him if you'd like.

00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:18.910
Oh, that would be great.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.710
Thank you very much.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.230
Larry, perhaps you've heard a fake Carter and David Thomas

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.949
have recently gotten engaged.

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.429
And they want to use the kingdom hall for their wedding.

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:32.909
So perhaps you and Kevin and myself

00:00:32.909 --> 00:00:35.350
we could get together for a few minutes tonight

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.590
and then make it move forward with their wedding plans.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.710
Tonight?

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.630
How many times you're going to do this to us, Tom?

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:44.829
Do what?

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.670
Keep having these unscheduled meetings.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.350
Look, maybe you're not so eager to get home

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.469
and spend time with your family, but some of us are.

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:57.030
Not want to spend time with my family?

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.590
What is that supposed to mean?

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.189
He is way out of line.

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:05.349
I should set him straight right now.

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:06.870
No.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.109
Wait.

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:11.790
What am I thinking?

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.150
If I react poorly right now, I could cause a major rift

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.230
between us, even between our families.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.750
And if we elders don't show love among ourselves,

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.909
imagine how this could affect the congregation.

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.310
What a dishonor that would be to Jehovah in Jesus.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.750
What do the Scriptures say?

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.150
Do not leave your place.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.430
Love does not become provoked.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.069
You're right, Larry.

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:47.629
I'm sorry.

00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:49.870
I just thought maybe we would take a few minutes,

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.709
but we can schedule a better time for this.

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:55.909
And that way we can all get home earlier.

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.349
No, Tom.

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:00.750
It's me that needs to apologize.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.829
I overreacted.

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:05.230
Look, you're right.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.950
Since all of us are here, it would be good for us

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.069
to take care of this if we can.

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:11.710
OK.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:12.229
OK.

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:13.789
Here comes Kevin.

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:15.349
Let's see if he's available.

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:16.949
OK.

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:18.150
Hey, Cap.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.069
Good to see you.
