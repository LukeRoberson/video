00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.919
I would like to talk about a valuable asset that every one of us possesses time.

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:12.160
It certainly is something that is on our minds as we go about our day's activities.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.640
Just think of how often you look at a clock, your watch, or your cell phone to check the time.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.480
Why do we do that?

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.440
Probably to see if we are ahead of time, on time, behind time, or out of time.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.480
But what exactly is time?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.520
One dictionary says it is a non-spatial continuum.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:43.799
Another says it is the thing that is measured as seconds, minutes, hours, days, and years.

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:48.799
To explain exactly what time is in simple terms is nearly impossible.

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:57.560
And the Bible does not define it, which may suggest that Jehovah knows it is beyond our ability to understand fully.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.520
But the Bible does discuss time.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.880
It shows that Jehovah is very time-conscious.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.680
It speaks of time as something that we should use wisely.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.920
And it gives us the amazing hope of living into infinity, that is endless time.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.079
We do know this about time.

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:22.319
Every human has exactly the same number of hours and minutes in each day.

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:28.200
Rich people cannot buy more hours, and scientists cannot invent new minutes.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:35.200
We can never recoup the time we have wasted, neither can we save it to spend on another day.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:43.239
Just think, we have exactly the same number of hours to use each day that Jesus Christ had when He was on the earth.

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:50.599
And we can be sure that no human used His time more wisely than did God's Son.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.840
It has been said that time is the most valuable thing a human can spend.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.879
And so it is up to us how we will use the time that is at our disposal.

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:06.719
In this regard, there is a Bible principle that gives us good direction,

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:13.199
a principle that was shared with us by the Apostle Paul at Philippians 1, 9 and 10.

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:15.400
He wrote in verse 9,

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:18.680
and this is what I continue praying.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.599
And in verse 10,

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.639
that you may make sure of the more important things.

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:32.319
Therefore, the theme of this month's program is, make time for the more important things.

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.759
This presents us with a twofold challenge.

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:40.719
First, we have to determine what are the more important things of life.

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:42.759
In the scripture we just read,

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:45.039
some Bible translations say,

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:48.159
have a sense of what is vital.

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:55.759
So we must distinguish between activities that are merely trivial and those that really matter.

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:59.919
In addition to the obligation to work to support one's family,

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:02.840
to care for necessary household chores,

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.120
to look after one's children or aging parents,

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:12.479
we have many important things of a spiritual nature that deserve our full attention,

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:15.000
reading and meditating on God's word,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.840
studying the Bible personally and in family worship,

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.599
preparing for and attending congregation meetings,

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:26.159
caring for any responsibilities that we have in the congregation,

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:30.439
and participating in the Christian ministry.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.400
Besides all of that,

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.159
who does not want some time to rest,

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:38.159
to exercise, to work in the garden,

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.319
to enjoy some recreation,

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.000
or to visit with family and friends?

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Have you ever felt that you did not have enough time to do all those things

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.080
that you have difficulty fitting all the spiritual activities into your busy life?

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.000
As much as we might like to,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.120
we cannot add an extra hour to our day,

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.199
or another day to our week, to accomplish more things.

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:11.240
So we have to be selective about how we spend the time that we have.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:17.639
We will get the most accomplished if we prioritize the things that really matter.

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.759
Now what does that mean?

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:26.639
To prioritize means to decide which tasks are more important and to do them first.

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:33.519
In other words, decide what must be given attention prior to other things.

00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:41.000
There is a Bible proverb that nicely illustrates the importance of prioritizing life's activities.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.439
Proverbs 12-11 states,

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:49.360
the one who cultivates his land will be satisfied with food,

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.800
but the one pursuing worthless things is lacking good sense.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.279
What a clear warning that is for a farmer,

00:04:57.279 --> 00:05:00.399
not to fill up his day with worthless endeavors

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:06.279
and waste the precious time that he should be spending working in his field.

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:10.839
Likewise, a Christian who diligently cultivates his spirituality

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:13.759
can be confident of Jehovah's blessing,

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:17.680
whereas a person who is distracted by worthless activities

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.319
puts his relationship with God in danger.

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:23.839
How can we avoid that?

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:28.040
By not taking valuable time away from spiritual pursuits

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:34.199
to spend on the things that distract us from serving Jehovah whole soul?

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:38.639
For example, when it comes to communicating with others,

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:40.959
what should take priority?

00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:47.279
Starting our day by giving Jehovah praise and thanks and prayer for another day of life?

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:52.519
Or telephoning an old friend to catch up on the latest news in his or her life?

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:55.480
There is nothing wrong with talking to a friend,

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:00.759
but we need to make sure we take the time to talk to our very best friend, Jehovah.

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:05.240
Obviously, it is more important to communicate with our Heavenly Father,

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.800
so praying to him should be a priority.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.240
The Apostle Paul had more to say about time management

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.160
at Ephesians 5-15-17, he wrote,

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.759
so keep strict watch that how you walk is not as unwise but as wise persons,

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:30.120
making the best use of your time, because the days are wicked.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.120
This account stopped being unreasonable,

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.720
but keep perceiving what the will of Jehovah is.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.720
Now we can address the second part of our challenge

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:46.360
to make ample time to care for the more important things of life.

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:52.720
What does Paul's council to make the best use of your time actually mean?

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.839
Literally in Greek it means to buy out the appointed time.

00:06:57.839 --> 00:07:02.839
That implies buying time at the expense of something else.

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:06.879
So it helps to analyze how our time is actually being spent

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:12.240
and to see what adjustments are needed so that we can buy out or make time

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.920
for the more important things.

00:07:15.959 --> 00:07:18.839
If we perceive what the will of Jehovah is,

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:22.680
then we certainly will want to use as much time as possible

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.040
to forge an ever stronger relationship with him

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.639
and to share fully in sacred service.

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:35.480
Do you have definite periods set aside for the spiritual activities of life?

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.639
For congregation meetings, the schedule is set for us.

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:44.040
We know exactly when our congregation meets for its midweek and weekend meetings.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:49.839
We just have to be sure that we did not let anything else get in the way of our attending

00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:52.240
because the meetings are a priority.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:57.120
Hebrews 10.25 says not to forsake them.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:03.199
For everything else, reading the Bible, preparing for meetings, family worship,

00:08:03.199 --> 00:08:08.279
field service activity, we have to set our own schedule

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:13.920
and stick to it as part of a good spiritual routine.

00:08:13.959 --> 00:08:20.199
As an example, what does your family do most Saturday mornings?

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:24.199
Many families have the routine of going in field service every Saturday,

00:08:24.199 --> 00:08:28.399
rarely is anything allowed to get in the way of that routine.

00:08:28.399 --> 00:08:34.080
For them, Saturday morning is not the time for music lessons, dance classes,

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.840
cooking courses, working out at the gym or anything else.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.559
It is their time for field service.

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:45.960
Having a routine like that makes life easier for everyone in the family.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:51.159
No one has to wonder Friday night, what is going to happen Saturday morning?

00:08:51.159 --> 00:08:56.559
The decision has already been made to go out in the ministry that day.

00:08:56.559 --> 00:09:02.320
Otherwise, if we leave it up to chance every week, then it means that 52 times during the year,

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.120
we have to decide whether to go in service on Saturday.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.759
How much simpler it is to make the decision once

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:14.000
and for all that we will use that time slot for the ministry,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.480
barring any serious unforeseen circumstances.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.840
Of course, given your family situation another day of the week may work better,

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.720
but you get the point.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:29.679
Sharing regularly in the Christian ministry cannot be left up to chance.

00:09:29.679 --> 00:09:35.759
At Mark 1310, Jesus prioritized the ministry when he said the good news

00:09:35.759 --> 00:09:39.279
has to be preached first.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:44.120
So if spiritual matters are going to take precedence in our lives,

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:53.399
we first have to make them priorities and second make ample time to care for those priorities.

00:09:53.399 --> 00:09:59.480
That means setting aside definite periods of time to build up our spirituality

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:04.840
and to stay fully involved in our worship and service.

00:10:04.879 --> 00:10:09.720
Ecclesiastes 3, verse 1, reinforces this thought.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:14.559
It states, there is an appointed time for everything,

00:10:14.559 --> 00:10:18.200
a time for every activity under the heavens.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:24.960
We have to decide when that appointed time is for each of our spiritual activities.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.399
If we are having difficulty with this,

00:10:27.399 --> 00:10:35.440
can we shorten the time we spend on hobbies, recreation, sports, social networking,

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:42.320
and devote that time to our Bible reading, family worship, meeting preparation, or field ministry?

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:48.879
If we can, we will find it to be spiritually refreshing and invigorating.

00:10:48.879 --> 00:10:51.960
This was the experience of a family man that I know.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:55.480
He'll begin preparing better so as to participate each week

00:10:55.519 --> 00:11:00.279
in the digging for spiritual jammer's portion of the midweek meeting.

00:11:00.279 --> 00:11:04.080
He made time on Sunday evenings for this.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:09.240
All in his family and congregation have benefited from the excellent points he has learned

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.039
as he does research on the assigned Bible reading.

00:11:12.039 --> 00:11:15.840
And he feels good because of it.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:21.279
One married couple decided to eliminate some of their hobbies and personal projects.

00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:24.080
They even packed them up and put them out of sight.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.600
Why?

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.799
So it's not to be distracted by those things.

00:11:28.799 --> 00:11:35.000
They were non-essential activities that they decided they could do without.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.399
Likely, we could all benefit from taking inventory of our lives

00:11:39.399 --> 00:11:46.000
and limiting any unnecessary activities that may be interfering with our spiritual routine.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.799
Imagine how rewarding that would be.

00:11:48.799 --> 00:11:52.120
Just think if we could buy out 30 minutes each day

00:11:52.159 --> 00:11:54.879
from doing something that is not essential.

00:11:54.879 --> 00:12:00.840
That is about how much time it would take to read the entire Bible in one year.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:05.399
Or if we could buy out an extra hour to each week for the field ministry.

00:12:05.399 --> 00:12:07.960
Think of how much more we could accomplish.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.440
And how happy that would make God in Christ

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:17.440
as they see us making time for the more important things.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:23.240
Now why have we felt the need to spend this time discussing how to manage time?

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:27.200
It is because of something else that the Bible tells us.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:32.759
First Corinthians 729 says that the time left is reduced.

00:12:32.759 --> 00:12:38.200
That certainly is true of the time that is left between now and the great tribulation.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:43.360
This is not the time to neglect the most important activity of all

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.600
our worship of Jehovah.
