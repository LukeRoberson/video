WEBVTT

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.429
Did you notice in each of the titles of our symposium talks, it uses the word

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:16.109
despite. The English word despite can mean without being blocked or thwarted. So

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.870
our ability to rejoice will not be blocked or thwarted. We can actually rejoice

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:29.070
despite trials. Well initially that sounds contradictory, doesn't it? I use

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:37.549
we associate with rejoicing the receiving of gifts, not trials. And yet that is the very point.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.909
We can rejoice despite trials because of gifts that Jehovah provides for us. And we're going to

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:52.509
review three of those in our symposium. Our relationship with Jehovah, our precious brotherhood,

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:00.189
and the glorious hope we have for the future. Please turn with me to Romans chapter five

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:09.469
verses three through five. And see if you can identify when this first gift is introduced

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:15.629
in the verses of relationship with Jehovah. Romans five three through five, it says not only

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.590
but let us rejoice while in tribulations since we know that tribulation produces endurance.

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.590
Endurance in turn and approve condition. Want to approve condition with whom?

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.549
It's with Jehovah. It says the approved condition in turn hope and the hope does not lead to

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.310
disappointment and why not? Because of this relationship with Jehovah, it says because the love

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.549
of God has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, which was given to us.

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:55.469
Yes, when we endure trials, we can sense Jehovah's approval. And that helps us to rejoice

00:01:55.469 --> 00:02:03.709
despite the hardship. Not find Romans 838 and 39. As you know, Paul experienced one trial after

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:11.150
the other. And yet he was convinced that no trial could distance him from Jehovah, could separate

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:19.789
him from God's love and abiding relationship. Romans 838 and 39. It says for I am convinced

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:27.550
that neither death nor life nor angels nor governments nor things now here nor things to come,

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:35.310
nor powers nor height nor depth. And then he says nor any other creation will be able to separate

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:44.030
us from God's love that's in Christ Jesus our Lord. Our relationship with God can help us

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:51.469
in times of trial. But how about the second gift from Jehovah? First Peter 5.9. First Peter 5.9,

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:56.750
Satan tries to capitalize on our trials. But notice the admonition here in verse 9.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.870
It says but take your stand against him, firm in the faith. And what will help?

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.750
It says knowing that the same kind of suffering, so trials, are being experienced by the entire

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:18.189
association of your brothers in the world. While we have felt that trust, the support from our

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:25.150
brotherhood, particularly these last six months or so, we've sensed it so clearly. Romans 1212 is our

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:32.830
third gift from Jehovah provision to help us to endure trials. Romans 1212 and it says it so

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:41.789
very crystal clear. It says rejoice in the hope. And then it adds endure under tribulation

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:50.590
persevere in prayer. So our relationship with Jehovah, the brotherhood and our hope can help us

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.590
deal with these circumstances. And it might vary depending on circumstance. Just as an example,

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:03.389
a brother in prison might have no access at all to the brotherhood. So what sustains him?

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.909
Well, in that case, it would be his relationship with Jehovah. You may be remembering

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:16.110
Brother Harold King on JW Broadcasting. For four and a half years, he was in solitary confinement

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:24.910
in a Chinese prison. But was he really all alone? The authorities thought so. But he had the best

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:33.709
cellmate anyone would ever want. He said in his video interview, he said, I had a lovely relationship

00:04:33.709 --> 00:04:41.790
with Jehovah. I loved him very dearly. He was real. He wasn't fictitious. Yes, Brother King was

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:47.149
able to rejoice under that trial because he had developed that real relationship with his God.

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:56.110
Another example. A depressed brother or sister may be struggling to maintain his relationship with

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:02.110
God. While there's another gift from Jehovah that can come into play, he may be supported by one

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:10.430
or more of the brotherhood. It's like a person who's fighting to breathe properly. He's still alive,

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:16.589
but he's struggling to hold on. But then incomes of support of a medical team and he begins

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:23.069
functioning normally again and breathing properly. Our brotherhood can come to our aid and support

00:05:23.709 --> 00:05:30.029
when we're suffering depression or some other serious trial. Well, how can our hope help us to

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:39.149
rejoice despite the trial? Another example. Some of us have Christian parents who are now old and

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:46.029
incapacitated in some way. And that's a trial for us. It might be like a loved one having a

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:51.870
bad accident. And now he's laid up in a hospital bed. He can't take care of himself.

00:05:52.829 --> 00:05:58.990
But then the doctor comes in and says, he's going to have a full recovery. Wow, that gives us

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:05.149
hope. It's similar with our elderly parents. Because of our sure hope of the future, it's like

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:11.949
Jehovah saying, they're going to have a full recovery from the ravages of old age. Yes, hope

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:17.629
helps us to rejoice. Whatever our situation or trial, we can be sure that one or more of these

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:24.990
provisions will help us suffer through the hardship with joy. I invite you to find now Romans chapter

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:35.779
eight. Romans chapter eight, we're going to look at verse 35 and 37. In this symposium,

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:41.620
we're going to be considering each of the seven trials mentioned in verse 35. Please identify

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:49.620
them with me. Romans 835. It says, who will separate us from the love of the Christ? Well, number one

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:55.939
tribulation, number two distress or persecution or hunger or nakedness or danger or sword.

00:06:56.819 --> 00:07:02.819
That's the seven. But now look at verse 37. It says, on the contrary, in all these things, all seven of

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:10.339
them, we are coming off completely victorious through the one who loved us. Well, each symposium

00:07:10.339 --> 00:07:19.300
talk will include a video of a brother or sister who experienced a trial, a severe one. And we will

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:27.540
identify which of these gifts help them to rejoice despite the tribulation. Let's consider that

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:34.100
first one that Paul addressed is called tribulation. Tribulation refers to suffering caused by some

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:42.420
trying situation, possibly a debilitating illness. Turn with me to second Corinthians chapter 12.

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.529
Second Corinthians 12, we're going to look at verse seven and eight.

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:55.170
This tribulation was vexing to Paul so much so that he called it a thorn in his flesh.

00:07:56.449 --> 00:08:01.009
Second Corinthians 12, seven and eight says, to keep me from becoming overly exalted,

00:08:01.009 --> 00:08:05.810
I was given a thorn in the flesh, an angel with Satan to keep slapping me.

00:08:06.769 --> 00:08:13.569
So I might not be overly exalted. Three times I begged the Lord about this that it would depart from me.

00:08:15.009 --> 00:08:21.329
A thorn in the flesh. So this obviously was a physical melody. And he said it kept slapping him.

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:28.290
So it was continuing on. It wasn't just like the common cold or flu and were better in a week or so.

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:34.610
This was continual. It was a chronic trial for him to deal with. And based on the scriptures,

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:40.370
it's thought that it may have been a serious degeneration of his eyesight. Well, that would have

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:46.289
been very disconcerning to Paul. In fact, he prayed three times that it would be gone,

00:08:46.289 --> 00:08:51.169
taken away from me. And remember, they did not have eyeglasses with corrective lenses back then.

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:59.169
No eye surgery was available. So this was a chronic tribulation. And think about this, by

00:08:59.169 --> 00:09:05.169
means of Holy Spirit, Paul had on a number of occasions cured people of their sickness.

00:09:06.049 --> 00:09:11.649
So he could have easily wondered, where is this gift of the Holy Spirit when I need it? I need a cure.

00:09:12.529 --> 00:09:18.929
Well, what helped Paul to rejoice despite his tribulation? It was as close a biting relationship

00:09:18.929 --> 00:09:25.169
with Jehovah. If you still have 2 Corinthians 12 there, let's read together verse 9. And this is

00:09:25.169 --> 00:09:34.529
where Jehovah tells Paul, you will have no miraculous cure. Verse 9, but he said to me,

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:41.090
my undeserved kindness is sufficient for you. For my power is being made perfect in weakness.

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:48.289
Jehovah says no cure, but I'm going to give you the power to continue on despite the tribulation.

00:09:49.169 --> 00:09:54.929
Well, notice the relationship that Paul evidently has with Jehovah the last part of that verse.

00:09:56.049 --> 00:10:02.450
He says, most gladly then, I will boast about my weaknesses in order that the power of the Christ

00:10:03.169 --> 00:10:09.809
may remain over me like a tent. He rejoiced in the strength from Jehovah. Look at verse 10.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:17.889
He says, so I take pleasure and we could substitute the word rejoice, a rejoice in weaknesses,

00:10:18.529 --> 00:10:25.649
in insults, in times of need, in persecutions and difficulties for Christ, for when I am weak,

00:10:25.649 --> 00:10:33.970
then I am powerful. Well, we want you to watch a video and this is an example of tribulation.

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:42.049
Now what helped this brother and his wife to rejoice under tribulation in the form of a serious

00:10:42.049 --> 00:10:58.559
illness. For the last 45 years, I've been pioneer work, traveling work,

00:11:00.559 --> 00:11:10.720
and being in Bethel here for a number of years. Health was very good. Never had any problems at all.

00:11:13.679 --> 00:11:21.120
One day I had a headache. It was severe. I really couldn't see clearly anything.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:29.919
We went to the Bethel doctor and he referred us to a specialist and a specialist gave us diagnosis

00:11:29.919 --> 00:11:39.070
of a very aggressive brain tumor called glioblastoma. He had surgery the next Thursday.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:50.419
Then after surgery, he had radiation and chemotherapy at the same time. A year later, he had to have

00:11:50.419 --> 00:11:57.220
another surgery and he is right now on his fourth type of chemotherapy treatment.

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:07.230
From the very first time he got sick, the hardest thing was to see my husband become increasingly

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:16.139
dependent upon me and upon other people. I didn't want this to define who we are.

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:27.259
The brothers played a pivotal role in trying to help us when found out that I had to go in for

00:12:27.259 --> 00:12:35.980
surgery, gave me a scripture and we prayed together and I'll always remember that. It was a

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:46.129
beautiful example and I also get a lot of encouragement from Sarah who gets us prepared for meetings.

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:54.990
When we go out in service, I've gotten an opportunity to go and help people.

00:12:55.950 --> 00:13:06.320
Just talk to them and encourage them. In my Bethel assignment in the service department,

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:13.519
I have a brother or two who will come over and reveal a case that we're considering

00:13:14.559 --> 00:13:22.159
and I get a lot of joy in that way. I'm very thankful that I can still do a little something

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:31.200
to help. For me, because he's been humbled through this whole thing, it's been easier.

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:41.149
My hope is strong and I'm going to keep right on going this way and serve Jehovah right

00:13:41.149 --> 00:13:50.049
on into the New World or whatever comes. Obviously, Scott and Sarah Schofner had a good

00:13:50.049 --> 00:13:57.490
relationship with Jehovah and Sarah supported Scott wonderfully. But do you notice the additional

00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:03.809
gift from Jehovah? Scott said the Brotherhood played a pivotal role in helping them.

00:14:03.809 --> 00:14:08.769
He remembered a specific scripture and a prayer that was shared before his surgery.

00:14:08.769 --> 00:14:13.250
And young brothers came in and helped him with his assignment afterward. In his own words,

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:21.250
he said, that brought him a lot of joy, joy, despite tribulation. So how about you? Which of the

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:28.690
provisions from Jehovah is boying you up as you deal with your particular trial or tribulation?

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:35.090
Your relationship with Jehovah? Is it the Brotherhood? Your hope. Or maybe some other gift from God.

00:14:36.049 --> 00:14:42.210
If you're stressed under tribulation, remember this. It's as if Jehovah is watching the monitor

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:52.450
and he sees us in pain of heart, but he reassures us as become. You're going to be okay. So no

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:58.289
matter the pain, no matter the tribulation may, we remember those words in Romans chapter 8

00:14:58.289 --> 00:15:06.210
verse 37 and 39. In all these things, we are coming off completely victorious through the one

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:14.210
who loved us. And verse 39, it's saying nothing, nothing, no tribulation will be able to separate us

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:22.690
from God's love that's in Christ Jesus our Lord. Rejoice, despite tribulation.

00:15:23.649 --> 00:15:28.850
And now it's my pleasure to introduce Brother Samuel Heard, member of the governing body,

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:35.090
for the talk on the symposium, we can rejoice despite distress.
