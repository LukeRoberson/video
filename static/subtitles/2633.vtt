You have one new voicemail. Good morning. It's John. It's your first day today, isn't it?

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.050
I guess you're nervous

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:19.489
But when you get the taste of it, I know you will love it. Don't forget to say a little prayer

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:54.429

The day our goal is to finish all this

00:01:11.269 --> 00:01:13.269
