00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:09.250
The good news that we preach has many facets, many aspects,

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.250
like a gorgeous, multifaceted diamond.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.250
But now, what is one facet that we especially enjoy teaching people about?

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:28.250
The fact that fateful humans under Kingdom rule will never grow old and die.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.250
Unlike Adam and Eve who threw away the privilege to eat of the tree of life

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.250
and live forever, faithful humans will be granted life without end.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.250
But now, sometimes when we discuss this aspect of the good news,

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.250
people bring up a couple of questions.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.250
One, they may say, is everlasting life really possible?

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.250
It just seems like it's too good to be true.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:07.250
And two, if I actually do live forever, will life not eventually become boring?

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.250
Well, let's discuss those two questions during our talk.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:20.250
Now, first, how can we be sure that everlasting life will become a reality?

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:30.250
The first and foremost reason, because the God who cannot lie has promised it.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:40.250
Revelation 21, 4 Jehovah says that he will wipe out every tear and death will be no more.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.250
And then, in effect, he publicly signs that promise.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:52.250
Next verse, verse 5, he says, right for these words are fateful and true.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:02:00.250
In other words, write it down where everyone can see what I promised and I certify it will happen.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.250
I guarantee it will.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.250
But now, here's a question.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:12.250
What evidence do we have that humans originally were designed to live forever?

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.250
Well, think about the first book of the Bible, the introductory book.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:26.250
The first two humans were told if they ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and bad, they would certainly die.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.250
Now, what is implied?

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:35.250
If they didn't eat, they were fateful, obedient, they would still be alive, they would never die.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.250
How old would Adam be now?

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.250
Little over 6,000 years old.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.250
Eve a little bit younger.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.250
How would they look?

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:51.250
Just as beautiful handsome, perfect as the day they were created.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.250
What would be their health condition?

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.250
They would feel just as healthy and vibrant as the day they were created.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.250
Now, we know they did sin and they died as Jehovah said.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.250
But his original purpose he was for them to live.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.250
And that purpose will be fulfilled as scriptures in the Bible certainly verify.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:22.250
What's another line of reasoning that we were originally designed to live forever?

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.250
Well, think about the astounding capacity of the human brain.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:34.250
Now, scientists in recent years are finding out more and more that the brain has much more capacity

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.250
than they previously thought, even just a couple of years ago.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.250
Here's what a recent study had to say about this.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:53.250
It said the average adult human brain's memory capacity is estimated to be two and a half million gigabytes.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:04:01.250
Now, if you want to compare that with a smartphone, the average smartphone 150 gigabytes.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.250
Two and a half million gigabytes, the brain?

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.250
150, a smartphone.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.250
No comparison.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:18.250
In fact, that study went on to say that the brain would never run out of storage capacity

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.250
because new memories keep replacing old wines.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.250
That happens because new neural connections are formed.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:33.250
So the brain was obviously designed to last forever.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.250
Never fill up.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.250
Don't give me your name.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.250
Don't give me any more information.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.250
My brain is full. I can't take it.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.250
No.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.250
Never reach that point.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.250
The brain could always take more Jehovah made it that way.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:57.250
You want to get a little maybe idea about the capacity of the human brain.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:04.250
Think about the tremendous download that Jesus received at His baptism.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:13.250
Eons of time, the memory of that all downloaded the human brain that Jesus had was able to hold.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.250
That's it.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.250
It was a human brain.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.250
It's perfect, but a human brain.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:25.250
The brain obviously is a very, very big place in a very, very small space, isn't it?

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.250
That certainly is the case.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.250
Now, here's our intriguing question.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:42.250
Why would Jehovah create us with a super brain super capacity if we're only designed to live 70 or 80 years?

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.250
Would even make sense, would it?

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:51.250
That would be like making a smartphone with two and a half million gigabyte capacity,

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:56.250
knowing that the user would only use a few hundred gigabytes in his whole lifetime.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:03.250
Or like building an automobile with a million horsepower engine,

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:09.250
knowing the owner would only use a few hundred horsepower during his life.

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.250
It wouldn't make sense, would it?

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:20.250
The brain obviously, loudly proclaims that humans were designed to live forever.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:24.250
Now, let's get one more line of reasoning that we're designed to live forever.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.250
Go to Ecclesiastes, please.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.250
Ecclesiastes chapter 3.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:36.250
In verse number 11, we'll read the A part, says,

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:42.250
He, Jehovah, has made everything beautiful in its time.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:50.250
He has even put eternity in their heart.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.250
Now, what does that mean?

00:06:52.250 --> 00:07:00.250
Well, Jehovah has implanted in the hearts of humans the desire, the strong craving to live eternally.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.250
To live forever.

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.250
Now, think about it.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.250
Isn't it true?

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:13.250
When death lurks at a person's door, we see they keep trying to live, don't they?

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:16.250
They will pursue doctors, medicine.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:20.250
They will endure all kinds of difficult treatments.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:21.250
They want to live.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:26.250
If a person was asked to pick the day on which he wished to die,

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:32.250
most would keep pushing that day further, farther, and farther into the future with me.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:35.250
See, they want to keep living.

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:39.250
See, throughout history, humans have looked for the fountain of youth,

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:43.250
the medicine, the elixir, a potion to keep them living,

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.250
and the search certainly continues today.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:48.250
But now, here's our intriguing question.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:52.250
Why would Jehovah create humans with that strong desire

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.250
if they're only meant to live 70 or 80 years?

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:57.250
It'd actually be cruel, wouldn't it?

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:03.250
Be kind of like you think of this illustration, tying a dog on a 20-foot chain

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:12.250
and putting a juicy steak, 21 feet from the post where that chain was secured.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:15.250
The dog could see that steak, he could smell that steak,

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:18.250
but he couldn't get a bite of it, could he?

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:19.250
That would be cruel.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:23.250
And we know Jehovah is definitely not a cruel God.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:27.250
He's a very loving Heavenly Father.

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:30.250
Well, the foregoing is just a few reasoning points

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:35.250
that humans were designed and will live forever.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:38.250
But now, let's get that second question.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:45.250
Why do some people reason that living forever would be boring?

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:50.250
Well, some reason that if everyone lives forever, they're all perfect.

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:56.250
Will they not all eventually become carbon copies of each other?

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.250
With variety being lost?

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.250
Well, that reasoning is not sound.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.250
Our publication is this life all there is,

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:08.250
addressed that shallow reasoning.

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:09.250
Here's what it said.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:12.250
It said, life in human perfection,

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:17.250
does not mean that everyone will be doing all things equally well

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:20.250
and with the same intense interest.

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:23.250
What the Bible holds forth is the promise of life

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.250
without sickness and death.

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:30.250
Healthy people today are not all alike.

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:35.250
So why should anyone conclude that bodily and mental perfection

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:39.250
would make people virtual copies of one another?

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:42.250
People will still vary as to personality.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:46.250
They will have varying preferences as to work, building,

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:50.250
home decoration, landscaping, food and drink,

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:55.250
entertainment, the fine arts, and so forth.

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:57.250
Additionally, think about this.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:03.250
There is nothing, absolutely nothing boring, about Jehovah,

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:06.250
or any of his creation.

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:10.250
I personally can't think of any two things that are exactly identical,

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:15.250
even so-called identical twins you're looking at here.

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:19.980
Notice their teeth are different.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:23.980
Their freckle pattern is different.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:25.980
Their fingerprints are different.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.980
Their personalities are different.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.980
They are certainly not identical.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:34.980
In fact, there are no two dogs, no two trees, no two tigers,

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:38.980
no two things I can think of that are exactly alike.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:41.980
Think about zebras for a moment.

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.980
Now you look at this herd of zebras,

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.980
looks like they're basically all striped the same.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:52.980
No two zebras on the planet striped exactly the same.

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:58.980
And scientists even think that this is how a baby zebra

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:02.980
recognizes and finds his mother in a big herd,

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:07.980
he memorizes her unique striping pattern.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.980
Isn't it amazing what evolution can do?

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:22.259
If you believe that, I've got a bridge to sell you.

00:11:22.259 --> 00:11:25.259
It's amazing what Jehovah has done.

00:11:25.259 --> 00:11:29.259
Or think about snowflakes for a moment.

00:11:29.259 --> 00:11:34.259
Out of the trillions of snowflakes that fall

00:11:34.259 --> 00:11:39.259
in one large snowstorm, no two alike.

00:11:39.259 --> 00:11:42.259
Amazing, even though all of them are succeeded.

00:11:42.259 --> 00:11:45.259
As you can see here, they're hexagonal,

00:11:45.259 --> 00:11:47.259
but no two alike.

00:11:47.259 --> 00:11:49.259
Nothing boring about Jehovah.

00:11:49.259 --> 00:11:54.259
And you can be sure that humans who are the work of the hands of a God

00:11:54.259 --> 00:11:59.259
of that kind of infinite variety will never become carbon copies

00:11:59.259 --> 00:12:01.259
of one another.

00:12:01.259 --> 00:12:05.259
Now another reason though, that people think some of them

00:12:05.259 --> 00:12:08.259
that living forever would be boring,

00:12:08.259 --> 00:12:12.259
they think that finally you would learn everything

00:12:12.259 --> 00:12:16.259
to learn, you'd do everything to do,

00:12:16.259 --> 00:12:19.259
and life would cease to be stimulating.

00:12:19.259 --> 00:12:22.259
It would become drab and uninteresting.

00:12:22.259 --> 00:12:26.259
Well again, such reasoning is not sound.

00:12:26.259 --> 00:12:31.259
First of all, to repeat something that is pleasurable

00:12:31.259 --> 00:12:33.259
is not boring, is it?

00:12:33.259 --> 00:12:35.259
I mean, think about eating.

00:12:35.259 --> 00:12:39.259
Most people eat over a thousand meals in a year.

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:44.259
Does a man who is 40 years old eaten over 40,000 meals

00:12:44.259 --> 00:12:47.259
is he more bored than the 20-year-old

00:12:47.259 --> 00:12:49.259
who's eaten 20,000 meals?

00:12:49.259 --> 00:12:52.259
No, that certainly is not the case.

00:12:52.259 --> 00:12:54.259
Think about apples.

00:12:54.259 --> 00:12:58.259
How many varieties of apples have you personally tasted?

00:12:58.259 --> 00:13:00.259
Maybe a couple of dozen.

00:13:00.259 --> 00:13:05.259
Fiji Gala, Rome, Macintosh, red and golden delicious,

00:13:05.259 --> 00:13:08.259
Granny Smith, Jonathan Winsap,

00:13:08.259 --> 00:13:11.259
maybe you've tried a couple dozen.

00:13:11.259 --> 00:13:17.259
Studies show there are more than 7,500 varieties

00:13:17.259 --> 00:13:19.259
of apples grown in the earth.

00:13:19.259 --> 00:13:21.259
If you sample one apple every day,

00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:23.259
it would take you over 20 years.

00:13:23.259 --> 00:13:27.259
Just to sample the varieties that are grown in the earth today,

00:13:27.259 --> 00:13:30.259
not speaking of one's new ones that may be developed

00:13:30.259 --> 00:13:33.259
in the New World, but it would take you over 20 years.

00:13:33.259 --> 00:13:35.259
And you could go 20 years later,

00:13:35.259 --> 00:13:39.259
back and eat that first one, you sample.

00:13:39.259 --> 00:13:46.259
It'd be like a brand-new variety, wouldn't it?

00:13:46.259 --> 00:13:49.259
Nothing boring about Jehovah's creation.

00:13:49.259 --> 00:13:51.259
Think about this, too.

00:13:51.259 --> 00:13:52.259
Another example.

00:13:52.259 --> 00:13:54.259
If you take a wonderful vacation

00:13:54.259 --> 00:13:56.259
and a beautiful part of the earth,

00:13:56.259 --> 00:13:59.259
you go back into the same area,

00:13:59.259 --> 00:14:02.259
you take another vacation as similar.

00:14:02.259 --> 00:14:03.259
Are you bored?

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:04.259
No.

00:14:04.259 --> 00:14:07.259
Repeating pleasurable things are not boring.

00:14:07.259 --> 00:14:09.259
And also, to remember,

00:14:09.259 --> 00:14:12.259
is that you will never learn it all.

00:14:12.259 --> 00:14:14.259
We will never do it all.

00:14:14.259 --> 00:14:16.259
Learn it or do it all.

00:14:16.259 --> 00:14:19.259
Let's go back to Ecclesiastes, chapter 3.

00:14:19.259 --> 00:14:25.259
And this time, let's read the entire verse, verse number 11.

00:14:25.259 --> 00:14:30.259
He, Jehovah, has made everything beautiful in its time.

00:14:30.259 --> 00:14:34.259
He has even put eternity in their heart.

00:14:34.259 --> 00:14:38.259
Yet mankind, now look at that word,

00:14:38.259 --> 00:14:45.259
will never, never find out the work that the true God has made

00:14:45.259 --> 00:14:47.259
from start to finish.

00:14:47.259 --> 00:14:51.259
So, Jehovah says, you'll never learn it all, you'll never do it all.

00:14:51.259 --> 00:14:57.259
How long would it take you to learn to play all the musical instruments that exist today

00:14:57.259 --> 00:15:00.259
to learn to play them well?

00:15:00.259 --> 00:15:04.259
People spend their whole life learning to play one instrument, don't they?

00:15:04.259 --> 00:15:08.259
When they die, they wish they had more time to develop that skill.

00:15:08.259 --> 00:15:12.259
What about new instruments even invented in the New World?

00:15:12.259 --> 00:15:18.259
You, brothers, imagine living a hundred years with a beard.

00:15:18.259 --> 00:15:22.509
Hundred years with just a mustache.

00:15:22.509 --> 00:15:25.509
Hundred years with a go-t.

00:15:25.509 --> 00:15:27.509
Hundred years clean shaven.

00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:33.919
Then go back and repeat that process with different variations.

00:15:33.919 --> 00:15:38.919
Imagine living a hundred years in a beautiful house that you built in the mountains,

00:15:38.919 --> 00:15:46.919
you and your family, and then trading that house with a house that a family built on the seashore.

00:15:46.919 --> 00:15:49.919
And you live in that house for a hundred years.

00:15:49.919 --> 00:15:52.919
Continue the trading process all around the planet Earth.

00:15:52.919 --> 00:15:56.919
So, finally, you get back to that original house that you built in the mountains,

00:15:56.919 --> 00:16:00.919
but now it's greatly improved.

00:16:00.919 --> 00:16:05.919
Remodel and beautiful, you live there another hundred years, you start that process.

00:16:05.919 --> 00:16:08.919
Again, I mean, just think about some of these things.

00:16:08.919 --> 00:16:16.919
Imagine learning about all the millions of varieties of fish, amphibians, mammals, birds, insects.

00:16:16.919 --> 00:16:22.259
I read about one man who studied fleas.

00:16:22.259 --> 00:16:26.259
Twenty-two years he spent studying fleas.

00:16:26.259 --> 00:16:31.259
He is a flea expert.

00:16:31.259 --> 00:16:36.259
Probably doesn't know much about anything else, but he knows about fleas.

00:16:36.259 --> 00:16:39.639
Twenty-two years.

00:16:39.639 --> 00:16:47.639
Imagine getting to know and appreciate every human among the billions

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:51.639
who will be living on the earth, getting to know and appreciate every one of them.

00:16:51.639 --> 00:16:58.639
Learning from their talents, their experiences coming to regard them as a dear friend.

00:16:58.639 --> 00:16:59.639
Just one example.

00:16:59.639 --> 00:17:04.640
When you like to spend some time with Noah's wife, I know I'd like to know,

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.640
what is your name?

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:11.640
Right now, we know Sister Noah, right?

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:18.640
And how were you and your husband able to protect your son from the evil influence that was around you?

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:22.640
What was it like in those years before the flood?

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.640
What was it like to come out of the earth?

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.640
You could spend a lot of time with Noah's wife, couldn't you?

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:38.640
Imagine learning about all each one of the more than 200 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.640
And then, after you do that, you can go to the next galaxy.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:48.640
And they estimate there are more galaxies than there are individual stars in the Milky Way galaxy.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.640
Now, you think of that and it gives you a headache, doesn't it?

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:56.640
A lot of time could be used there, even more impossible.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:01.640
Imagine learning about Jehovah throughout all eternity.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:08.640
We will learn more and more fascinating things about our God and never begin to learn it all.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:14.640
Well, we could go on and on, but hopefully we could use some of these points if we ever encounter someone

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:19.640
who brings up that reasoning, is it really possible to live forever?

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.640
It's not only possible.

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:23.640
It's guaranteed, isn't it?

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.640
And it definitely will not be boring.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:31.640
And hopefully all of us appreciate even more.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:39.640
This marvelous prize that Jehovah has invited humans to reach out and take hold of,

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:46.640
don't miss it, don't miss it, reach out and take hold of the real life.
