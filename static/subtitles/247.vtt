00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:16.949
I thought we were going home, but everyone wanted to go to another gathering.

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.750
I told them I had a service plans in the next morning.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:26.579
I was hoping to get this new Bible study going, and I needed some time to prepare.

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:28.579
It didn't go over so well.

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.619
They started pressuring me, saying, well, what if he's not there?

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.179
Yeah, why go through all that work for nothing?

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:39.619
It kept getting worse.

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:41.899
Just skip it, they said.

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.259
Come on Tyler, don't make us drive you all the way home first.

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:48.729
Just come.

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:51.369
Everyone was against me.

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:55.100
I didn't know what to do.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.060
But then I remembered a family worship.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.179
We studied about Caleb.

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:03.500
What gave him the courage to be different?

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.170
Jehovah is with us, he said.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:15.420
That helped me to remember that Jehovah is with me too.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.180
I told them that the gathering sounded really fun, but if it meant missing my Bible study,

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.540
it wasn't worth it.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:37.420
I told them I would find my own right home.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.739
Everything was going fine until Mr. Craig started talking about evolution.

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:49.379
He said, the wide variations of living things on earth are the results of the evolutionary

00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:50.900
process.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.260
All living creatures, including us, descended from a common ancestor.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:02.219
Most of the class agreed with him, but the other witnesses chose to stay quiet.

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:13.659
I wanted to speak up like Tyler did, but I was scared too.

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.340
But then I remembered my Bible study.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.060
Last week we studied about Jail.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.860
She probably felt scared too when facing the terrifying Cicero, but she used a tool she

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.939
had to come to the assistance of Jehovah, and he blessed her for it.

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:34.979
It made me think about what tools do I have.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.060
I think there are good reasons to believe that God designed all living things.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.099
My phone contains a lot of information.

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:48.939
My contacts, notes, emails, pictures, but it didn't come that way.

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:50.539
I put it there.

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:52.500
That's just a phone.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.219
What about the information for this plant?

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:57.659
Where did it come from?

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:18.710
I'm really glad I took a stand, and it even led to a good witness.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.710
Recently after school, I saw Tamiko give a good witness.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:36.520
She even started a Bible study, but not everyone was a fan, especially these kids.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.680
They saw me out preaching last week.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.439
They started saying things like, no one wants to read your garbage.

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:44.840
Why do you always push your ideas on people?

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.150
Do your parents force you?

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.389
At that point, I would have given almost anything for them to leave me alone.

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:59.270
But last week, we studied about the prophet Micaiah at family worship.

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.629
He could have easily lied to the king, but instead he spoke the truth, and he made Jehovah's

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.439
heart proud.

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:10.599
I wanted to make Jehovah's heart proud too.

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.759
Then I told them, you want the truth?

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:15.759
No one forces me to preach.

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:18.959
I do because I want to.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:27.029
Jehovah's Witnesses love people, and we want to share with them good news from the Bible.

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:42.329
One of them said I gave the wrong answer, but I didn't think so.

00:04:42.329 --> 00:04:45.649
Kevin and I were having a great morning.

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:55.810
We met a lot of nice people, but then we saw those same kids from school.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.930
Kevin said that we should just leave, and that we didn't need any trouble.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:07.009
At that point, I could feel my palms starting to sweat, but I knew I'd have to face them

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:09.319
again.

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:11.959
Then I thought about Jeremiah.

00:05:11.959 --> 00:05:15.360
I recently did some personal study on him.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.079
And when threatened, he bravely told his opposers, I am in your hand.

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:24.899
He stayed the course.

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:31.100
I want to stay the course.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:38.430
They said, we told you to stop forcing your stupid ideas on people.

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:50.050
But I told them I wasn't going anywhere.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:06:14.360
Then he just laughed and said I wasn't worth it.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:20.079
My boss called me into his office, and he offered me a promotion to a full-time position,

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:23.939
which would mean a lot more money.

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:29.139
I was in a meeting at work, and they told me how much they appreciate me and my good work

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:30.139
ethic.

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:40.149
And then suddenly, they offered me this full scholarship to start pursuing a career.

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:44.629
My uncle told me he'd back me financially if I ever wanted to stop working for him and

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:50.240
start my own construction business.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.560
A few weeks later, a brother was giving a talk at a circuit assembly.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.279
He read Mark 1021, where Jesus told the rich young ruler.

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:01.560
One thing is missing about you.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:07.319
Go, tell what things you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:09.800
and come be my follower.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.439
Then he made the point.

00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:15.720
Instead of grabbing on to a rich spiritual opportunity, that young ruler just let it slide

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.800
by.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.439
And he asked us, is one thing missing from your life?

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:25.639
He was right, something was missing.

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:31.319
I'm baptized, but am I really giving Jehovah my all?

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:32.920
Could I do it?

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:39.000
Could I do more?

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:47.819
I was determined not to let a spiritual opportunity like full-time service pass me by.

00:07:47.819 --> 00:07:53.699
You need courage not only when things are bad, but you also need it to pursue a life

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:56.699
of self-sacrifice.

00:07:56.699 --> 00:08:02.100
But when you do, you'll have no regrets, because nothing will ever be missing from your

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.100
life.
