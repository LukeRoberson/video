WEBVTT

00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:08.960
None of us like to contemplate being in a serious accident or receiving news that we have

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.240
a very serious illness that may even be life-threatening.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:21.280
When the blood issue also arises at such times, of course, we're all determined that we're

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:29.320
going to keep our integrity, but we also feel the need for comfort and for support so that

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.920
we can remain faithful.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:39.200
Now Jehovah never promised, for this period of time, that we would receive miraculous healing,

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.439
but he did promise that we would receive something very significant.

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:44.840
Would you open your Bibles with me?

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:52.399
Let's look together at Psalm 41 and verse 3.

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.399
He says, Jehovah will sustain him on his sick bed.

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.600
During his sickness, you will completely change his bed.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.239
Well now the watchtower, back in 2008, the September 15th issue, just made a nice little comment

00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:09.239
on this verse.

00:01:09.239 --> 00:01:15.040
It said, David did not expect Jehovah to perform a miracle and remove his sickness.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:23.040
Rather, David felt certain that Jehovah would sustain him, that is, give him support and

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.239
strength while he was lying on his sick bed.

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:29.599
Well, that's what Jehovah has promised.

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:33.760
He's promised that he's going to provide us with the support and the strength that we

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.640
need so that we can keep our integrity.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.439
Well hospital information services here in Brooklyn, the hospital information desks at

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:50.760
each of the branches and the hospital liaison committees have been a very powerful tool,

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:57.760
in the hand of Jehovah, to provide this support and strength when the blood issue arises.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:07.239
Did you know that now worldwide, there are some 1700, that is 1,700 hospital liaison committees

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:11.599
with over 13,000 members.

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.680
This is not easy work.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.039
The vast majority of these brothers are not physicians, they're not connected to the

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:21.759
medical community in any way.

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:26.840
Often they have to get up in the middle of the night to go to the hospital.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.080
Sometimes they deal with very confrontational situations.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.520
Usually all of the situations that they deal with are emotionally charged.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.000
Their work is very seldom seen by others.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.520
They are not in the spotlight.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:50.599
Well when we reflect on the work of these wonderful brothers who are willing to accomplish this

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:56.240
work of giving assistance and support and help to our brothers, we can't help but think

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:05.240
of this scripture in Jeremiah chapter 23, where Jehovah says, Jeremiah chapter 23 and

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:13.360
verse 4, and I will raise up over them shepherds who will really shepherd them.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:20.199
They will no longer be afraid or be terrified and none will be missing, declares Jehovah.

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:26.680
Well, that's exactly what the hospital liaison committee brothers do.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.479
They are wonderful shepherds who are there to help the brothers, to have the information

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:36.439
and the assistance they need so that they can maintain their integrity.

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:41.840
I recall one experience when I was working with a hospital information desk in Canada,

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:48.080
a sister in a northern Canadian city, she had been very, very seriously injured.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:54.840
She had to be airlifted to a larger center where she would be able to receive more intensive

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.840
care.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.560
A hospital liaison committee member was immediately notified.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.840
He went to the hospital and so as soon as the aircraft landed and the sister was being

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.280
taken off and wheeled into the hospital, there the brother was waiting in the hallway.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.600
And so when he approached her lying on this stretcher, the sister was trembling with fear.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:25.360
Well, when he looked down at her, she looked up and she said, are you a doctor?

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.399
And he said, no, I am your brother.

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:37.519
Well, immediately the sister, this huge sigh of relief, because now there was someone

00:04:37.519 --> 00:04:41.279
who could give her the practical help that she so much needed.

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:47.160
Well, what are some of the ways that this arrangement does provide practical support?

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:53.680
Well, I'm not sure if you know this, but at 89 branch offices around the world, including

00:04:53.680 --> 00:05:00.240
the United States and Canada, we have brothers who are on call 24 hours a day, seven days

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.439
a week, to answer calls from hospital liaison committee members, and also from doctors

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:12.600
who request assistance on how to treat Jehovah's Witnesses without the use of blood.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.000
This is an amazing arrangement.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.759
When I worked with HIS, I recall many times in the middle of the night, we would receive

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:26.600
calls from a brother or a sister or from an HLC or from a doctor about someone who was

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.399
desperately in need of assistance.

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:32.920
And the organization had provided such wonderful tools.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:41.000
For example, a database has been assembled of literally thousands of medical articles

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.759
from respected medical journals.

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:50.199
Now these articles can be sent to a doctor or to a medical team, and they explain in

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:57.879
very specifically what can be done to address a situation without the use of blood transfusion.

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:02.560
Often when a doctor receives an article like that, he sees it's from one of his peers,

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.120
it's been published in a respected journal, he is much more willing to cooperate.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.920
And also, he sees in a practical way what can be done.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:19.600
But even better, each hospital information desk maintains a list of consulting doctors.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:26.879
Now these are very well respected physicians who are not afraid to confer with other doctors

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:33.240
and explain to them how even very complex, very difficult cases can be managed without

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.240
the use of blood.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.959
I recall one time in the middle of the night, we received a call about a sister who had

00:06:40.959 --> 00:06:45.519
just given birth and she had lost a significant amount of blood.

00:06:45.519 --> 00:06:50.639
The doctor managing her case was very interested in receiving help.

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:58.120
Well, we called a very, very well respected professor of obstetrics and gynecology in Canada

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.920
who was always willing to provide assistance.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:07.879
Well, I started off the call by saying, I'm so sorry to call you so late at night.

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:14.079
Well the doctor said, please don't apologize Mark, I'm always happy to do anything I can

00:07:14.079 --> 00:07:15.600
to help the sisters.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.639
Well, of course, he was not a witness himself.

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:27.040
But he viewed those dear ones as his own sisters and he was willing to help them.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:33.000
Well, such courageous and skilled physicians all around the world have done so much to

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.600
help our brothers and the tools just keep on improving.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:46.079
I many of you may know that now we have a section for medical professionals on our JW.org

00:07:46.079 --> 00:07:47.079
website.

00:07:47.079 --> 00:07:53.199
Now, I'll reiterate, this is not a site or an area for Jehovah's people.

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:56.920
It's specifically designed for medical professionals.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:03.240
But that area, although it's only recently been established, is already having a wonderful

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.240
effect.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.560
Let me relate this experience.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.519
The sister wrote this into the branch.

00:08:09.519 --> 00:08:14.120
She said, recently, my husband took me to the emergency room and we discovered I had

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:20.000
a mass of some sort near my appendix and that a huge and possibly messy surgery was needed

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.920
to discover the problem.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:26.160
When I told the surgeon that was assigned to me that I was one of Jehovah's witnesses,

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:31.839
he became agitated when I reinforced my non-negotiable stand.

00:08:31.839 --> 00:08:36.539
He never became rude or harsh, but I could tell that he was very troubled.

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:40.659
My husband left to make a phone call to the brothers.

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:46.860
Five minutes later, a resident came to tell me that the surgeon had just gone to the JW.org

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:50.580
website and was downloading information.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.740
We had never mentioned the website.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.899
How he knew or who told him will never know.

00:08:55.899 --> 00:09:00.179
But ten minutes later, he came back with copies of the information.

00:09:00.179 --> 00:09:05.379
He had read it, he had marked the pages, and he went over everything with my husband

00:09:05.419 --> 00:09:06.740
and I.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.059
Then he took my hand and he smiled.

00:09:10.059 --> 00:09:15.259
He asked if I was ready and he promised to do his very best for me.

00:09:15.259 --> 00:09:22.259
He said he too had made some non-negotiable decisions with God in his lifetime.

00:09:22.259 --> 00:09:28.100
He saw me about twelve hours after the surgery and I teased him about being a trouble.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:32.139
He said, no, it was extraordinary.

00:09:32.139 --> 00:09:37.860
We know he meant what he had just learned about the Hospital liaison committee and Jehovah's

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.220
provision for information for his people.

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:47.899
The sister concluded by saying, I have never felt such a wave of peace from Jehovah in

00:09:47.899 --> 00:09:50.100
all my years in the truth.

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:57.659
Well, Jehovah did not promise us miraculous healing at this time, but he did promise that

00:09:57.659 --> 00:10:03.139
he would provide us with support and strength when we are sick.

00:10:03.139 --> 00:10:09.139
What a beautiful gift Jehovah has given his people through the fine work of the Hospital

00:10:09.139 --> 00:10:10.779
liaison committees.

00:10:10.779 --> 00:10:17.460
Truly, this has been a strengthening aid for us to keep abstaining from blood.
