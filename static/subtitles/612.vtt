00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:08.320
Let's open our Bibles to today's text, 1st Thessalonians chapter 2, and let's read verse 8 in its entirety.

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:17.519
So having tender affection for you, we were determined to impart to you not only the good news of God,

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.679
but also our very selves, because you became so beloved to us.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.559
In our discussion this morning, we're going to address two things.

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:36.960
Why did Paul love the Thessalonians so much, and then what efforts did he go to to show it?

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.479
The question why did Paul love the Thessalonians might seem a little odd,

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:49.759
but notice what the Insight book says about Godly love? It says this.

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:56.000
Godly love is not a quality that one has without knowing why.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:04.799
It goes on to say, Godly love cannot exist in the person apart from knowledge and service of God,

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.200
or apart from meditation and appreciation.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.780
So we don't love someone and not know why. There are reasons.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.180
There are many reasons why we loved Jehovah, but that same principle applies to those of our brotherhood.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.780
So why did Paul love the Thessalonians?

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.500
Well, he and Silas in the year 50 CE were used to bring the good news to the Thessalonians,

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.340
and a number of Jews and many Greek proselytes became disciples.

00:01:37.379 --> 00:01:41.540
So on one hand, Paul knew that Jehovah was drawing these people to him,

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.019
and if Jehovah loved them, Paul should certainly love them.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.260
But beyond that, there was this instructor-teacher relationship, a very close bond.

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.579
But the thing that also made Paul love them even more

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.060
was what those brothers had to go through, learning and staying in the truth.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:08.180
In Acts chapter 17, it describes the hostility that the Jews brought upon those in Thessalonica.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.699
It was so dangerous that Paul and Silas had to flee the city.

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:16.419
That persecution continued after Paul and Silas were gone,

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:22.020
and then one or perhaps more of their congregation fell asleep in death.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.860
And it caused great sorrow.

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:29.620
So Paul sent Timothy to find out how are the brothers doing?

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.580
They were doing quite well.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.460
In fact, let's look at first Thessalonians chapter 1,

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:39.060
and we'll look at some of the key verses beginning in verse 3,

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.419
first Thessalonians 1, 3, the good report.

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:50.740
For we continually remember your faithful work, your loving labor, and your endurance.

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:57.300
And then look at verse 6, and you became imitators of us and of the Lord,

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.620
seeing that you accepted the word under much tribulation with joy of Holy Spirit,

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:09.460
so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in a cave.

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:13.060
So what added to the depth of Paul's love?

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:20.020
What these dear brothers had gone through with unwavering loyalty and faith and joy?

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.379
He loved them even more so.

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:26.620
So what is the lesson for us?

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:29.419
Remember what the insight book said?

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:34.300
Godly love is not a quality that one has without knowing why,

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.819
and without knowledge of God, a part from meditation,

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.300
and including appreciation, love can exist.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.979
So how can knowledge of our brothers help us to meditate,

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:53.500
build appreciation, and deepen love?

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:58.460
Well, we can think about what they may have gone through when they came into the truth,

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.740
or growing up in the truth.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.719
Did this young person grow up in a dysfunctional family?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.680
Did they learn the truth as a teenager and their parents opposed them bitterly?

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:16.160
Did they learn it as an adult and had to get rid of all sorts of bad association and filthy habits,

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.839
and addictions, and yet here all of those folks are,

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:26.000
in the truth, having come so far and staying faithful.

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:30.240
When we were, if you that, and we meditate on that,

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.360
it makes them more lovable.

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.480
And when we love them that much and our appreciation is enhanced,

00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:44.639
it affects our patients with them, our compassion, our empathy.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.639
We understand why they say what they say sometimes.

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.800
Why do they act the way they do sometimes?

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.439
That knowledge and appreciation helps us to love them even more.

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:06.189
Now, we noticed the apostle Paul expressed his love to the Thessalonians in a variety of ways,

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.310
but one way was he told them that he loved them.

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:16.430
And in doing so, Paul was following the example of Jehovah.

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:23.709
Remember, at Jesus' baptism in 29 CE, Jesus heard his own Father's voice, tell him,

00:05:24.269 --> 00:05:26.990
you are my son, the beloved.

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.430
And in the year 32 CE,

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:35.870
Jesus heard his Father's voice say to him at the transfiguration,

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:44.189
this is my son, the beloved, whom I have approved, listened to him.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.149
Now, there's no question that when Jesus was going through his earthly ministry,

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.750
he loved his Father. That was his greatest motivation.

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:56.750
But a greater motivation to him,

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:04.750
a key factor in his not tiring out through all the trials he went through was the fact that he knew

00:06:04.829 --> 00:06:10.350
his Father loved him. Just notice these quotes from the Gospel of John.

00:06:11.149 --> 00:06:16.910
Jesus is speaking. John 3.35, the Father loves the Son.

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.189
John 5.20, for the Father has affection for the Son.

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:29.550
John 59, just as the Father has loved me, so I have loved you.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.720
So it is a good thing when we have these feelings of affection and love

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.600
that we express that to our brothers.

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:45.680
Have you ever been going through a difficult time and then a close friend, a fellow worker

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:52.000
comes along and says, just remember, we love you. That can be so encouraging.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.439
It was encouraging to Jesus to hear his Father say that.

00:06:56.879 --> 00:07:00.240
And besides just saying that, what else did the Apostle Paul do?

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:06.560
Let's go to First Thessalonians, chapter 2, and let's look at verses 11 and 12.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.959
Now, this is beyond just saying, I love you.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.439
There's a sacrifice involved here, verse 11.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:23.040
You all know that we kept exhorting and consoling you and bearing witness to each one of you,

00:07:23.839 --> 00:07:29.279
just as a Father does His children, so that you would go on walking

00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:34.079
worthy of God who is calling you to His kingdom and glory.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:41.920
Paul uses the illustration of a loving, caring Father who not only tells His children,

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:46.240
I love you, but what else does He do? He exhorts them.

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:50.319
What does that mean? Basically, the Greek meaning is to encourage.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:57.279
It means to impress upon someone the importance of them continuing on on a good course

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:05.199
that would lead to blessings from Jehovah. That takes effort, time, and then Paul also

00:08:05.199 --> 00:08:14.720
consoled them. What does that mean? Comfort, sooth, calm, reassure. A loving Father does all that.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:23.279
And we can imitate Jehovah, Paul, by doing the same thing with our brothers. We love them.

00:08:23.839 --> 00:08:31.279
So we put forth the effort to exhort, to console. Now, all of this is going to take effort,

00:08:31.279 --> 00:08:37.759
isn't it? Paul said that he gave of him very self. He gave everything he had.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.399
In a similar thought, at 2 Corinthians 1215, he said,

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:51.840
For my part, I will most gladly spend and be completely spent for you.

00:08:54.539 --> 00:08:59.980
A commenter quoted in our magazines, a Bible scholar said, in effect,

00:09:01.019 --> 00:09:02.059
Paul was saying this,

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:11.340
I am willing to spend my strength and time and life and all that I have for your welfare as a

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:19.259
father, cheerfully does for his children. And he was going to do it at times to the point of

00:09:19.259 --> 00:09:27.580
exhaustion and being totally worn out. But what was the spirit behind that? Be grudging it,

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:36.700
complaining, most gladly, Paul did that. The Jerusalem Bible says, perfectly willing to do so.

00:09:38.669 --> 00:09:44.990
So what did we learn in our discussion this morning? The Apostle Paul knew exactly why he loved

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:51.549
the Thessalonians. Jehovah loved them. There was a bond, and he loved them for their endurance,

00:09:52.269 --> 00:09:58.830
and he wanted to help them. And he did everything he could by his actions, and what he said to them,

00:09:59.389 --> 00:10:05.629
to prove to them that he loved them. So may we be determined to love our brothers and sisters,

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:14.029
to express love by what we say, but also by what we do, and to do it so in a perfectly

00:10:14.029 --> 00:10:22.509
willing to do so attitude.
