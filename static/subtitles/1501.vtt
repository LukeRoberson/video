00:00:05.169 --> 00:00:09.169
Daniel received a prophecy about the coming of two rivals,

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:13.169
the King of the North and the King of the South.

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:22.140
How has it been fulfilled?

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.140
In the late 1800s, the German Empire became the King of the North.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.140
That government brought its power and heart against the King of the South,

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.140
with a large army.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.140
In fact, its navy was the second largest unearth,

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.869
who became the King of the South.

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:47.869
The alliance between Britain and the United States.

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:53.869
He fought during World War I with an exceedingly large and mighty army.

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:59.729
He swept away and humbled the King of the North.

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:02.729
But that was not the end of the King of the North.

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:08.730
He turned his attention to and then hurled denunciations against the Holy Covenant.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.730
He removed the constant feature.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.730
By limiting the freedom of God's people to preach,

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:23.359
imprisoning many and even killing hundreds of God's anointed ones and their fellow workers.

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:28.890
After Germany was defeated in World War II,

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.890
the Soviet Union became the King of the North.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.890
It worked with the King of the South to put in place the disgusting thing that causes desolation.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:51.709
The United Nations.

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:53.709
Beginning in the early 1900s,

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:58.709
the Soviet government tried to eliminate religion in the lands under its control,

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:05.599
fulfilling the words that he would show no regard for the God of his fathers.

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:14.789
He gave glory not to the God of heaven, but to the God of fortresses.

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:21.780
As prophesied, he used this military might against the King of the South

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.780
by engaging with him in a pushing.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.780
Anglo-America competed with the Soviet Union for world domination,

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.780
fighting in and supporting wars and political struggles around the globe.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:41.539
After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991,

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:45.539
it was unclear who would fill the role of the King of the North.

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:51.539
For a time, God's people there had been able to preach and worship peacefully.

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:57.539
But in recent years, Russia and its allies have pushed back at the King of the South.

00:02:57.539 --> 00:03:02.539
Both kings have accused each other of destructive cyber and economic attacks.

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:08.539
But the King of the North has not limited his attacks to the King of the South.

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:13.539
As foretold, he also entered into the land of the decoration.

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:16.539
Our realm of spiritual activity.

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:21.539
Today, Russian authorities continue to attack true worship.

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:26.460
We expect such persecution.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.460
But we also expect it to end.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:53.150
Our King, Jesus Christ, is more powerful than any human government.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:01.460
Soon, he will destroy not only the kings of the North, South, but all of his enemies.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:06.740
And he will deliver God's loyal people.
