WEBVTT

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.309
And we have one more announcement.

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:19.429
Sister Lydia Diaz is now serving as a regular pioneer.

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:22.269
We're so happy for you.

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:27.070
We know you'll have many spiritual adventures ahead of you.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:48.649
Adventurers ahead of you.

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:57.179
We want to be a pioneer.

00:00:57.179 --> 00:00:59.740
That's wonderful, Caleb.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:05.019
What do you think pioneers do?

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.459
Go on adventures?

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:10.340
A pioneer's life is exciting.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.980
Do you remember when we talked about being a publisher?

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.620
They preached the good news.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:23.099
But pioneering is a way we can give even more to Jehovah.

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:25.540
Pioneers devote their time and energy

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.299
to help as many people as possible to become Jehovah's friends.

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.500
I love to do that.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.340
I know you do.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.260
Pioneers also get to go to school.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.299
Not that type of school.

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.060
A special school that they attend with other pioneers.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.579
Where they dig into the Bible and learn how to become an even better friend of Jehovah.

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:51.939
It's a lot of fun.

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:54.379
Oh, that's cool.

00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:59.099
So pioneers don't go on adventures?

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:01.980
Oh no, they do.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.900
And pioneers look for Jehovah's friends all over the earth.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.580
And some travel to far away places.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.979
You know, Caleb, keep telling others about Jehovah.

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:19.419
And when the time comes, you will be ready to go on the adventure of pioneering.
