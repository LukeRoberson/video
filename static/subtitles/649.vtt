00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:07.500
It is a pleasure to bring you the warm love in greetings of our Bethel family of about

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.500
100 in cold rainy Addis Abebaam.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:18.339
Yes, the Ethiopian islands are green from heavy rainfall and even from hail.

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:25.019
We are glad to say that in an area of our earth might by much unrest with wars in the

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:32.740
two Sudan's to our west, bomblasts in Yemen and Somalia to our east, severe conditions

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:41.140
in area to our north, and even some negative incidents in Kenya to our south, we have enjoyed

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.979
the calm, conducive to expanding the work.

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:53.619
Despite the weather, our now over 10,000 publishers, 10,000 11 was the latest peak, are very

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:56.460
active in Jehovah's service.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:05.260
In both March and April, when we had warmer weather, 44% were in pioneer service, but we

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.299
are expecting a report of good participation in cold August as well.

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:17.379
The different campaigns during the year provided stimulus to the preaching activity.

00:01:17.379 --> 00:01:23.980
For seven years now, special preaching campaigns of three months in new or seldom worked

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.019
territory have been arranged.

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:33.659
This year, over 60 brothers and sisters from overseas came to help, and they located

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.700
much interest.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.859
This has served not only to reach a larger segment of our population of nearly 90 million

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:51.140
people, but also to stimulate our local publishers to see the joy and responsibility of expanding

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.099
the harvest work.

00:01:54.099 --> 00:02:00.819
Another campaign was the worldwide work with track number 38 entitled, Can the Dead Really

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:02.500
Live Again.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:09.539
During this activity, a pioneer brother saw a sad looking man come out of a house.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:16.419
When he was offered the track with its appealing question, it readily captivated his interest.

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:22.219
He disclosed that he was Sudanese and had just lost three cousins in the fighting in the

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:24.219
south Sudan.

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:31.659
He then remarked that in his church, one does not receive such encouragement or comfort.

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:37.219
He added that his family was, in fact, mourning in the house when something just moved him

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:39.340
to go outside.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.539
He concluded that God must have sent our brothers to comfort them.

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:48.500
Then he promptly called two relatives to listen with him.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:55.300
One of them then had to travel, but the other two are now studying the Bible Teachbook regularly.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.780
This was also the year for us to begin special metropolitan public witnessing.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.740
The first place where this was arranged was the regional capital and university town of

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.460
Adamah.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.900
The results exceeded all expectations.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.419
Many people felt free to approach the display.

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:22.340
And during the first three months at that one location, over 7,000 publications were placed

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.419
and 1,403 requested Bible studies.

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:30.740
The effects are far reaching.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.379
One man had come from more than 300 miles away.

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:40.740
And when he saw the display approach to tell the brothers, I always read your publications

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.460
on my mobile phone.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.139
Mobile phones are widespread even in rural Ethiopia.

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:54.340
This man was pleased to arrange for a regular Bible study over the phone in the early morning

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.180
hours.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.580
From another town, we received a series of photographs of the activity around the display.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:08.780
And most of the pictures one cannot even see the display for the crowds of people flocking

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.699
around it.

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:17.019
In one location in the capital, some brothers first had to visit a police station.

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.620
To their delight, the officer in charge commended Jehovah's Witnesses and encouraged the other

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.180
officers to take and read our literature.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.860
Of course our brothers were pleased to oblige and thus placed a variety of publications.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.819
Where we do not yet have the report for the special activity in August, we heard of a group

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:46.939
of four pioneers traveling some 3,000 kilometers throughout northern Ethiopia looking for Chinese

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:53.139
companies and they found 30 of these where they could witness.

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:58.459
Our brothers now look forward to the conventions in October and around this time the invitation

00:04:58.459 --> 00:05:00.860
activity would begin.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.459
Much translation work remains to be done as we still have languages with over a million

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:10.819
people without any of our publications.

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:17.300
Also efforts are underway to set up the school for Kingdom Proof Evangelizers in the Amharic

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:23.100
language and hundreds of keen pioneers are waiting to benefit.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:29.420
Thus in line with 1st Peter chapter 1 verse 13, we have every reason to keep our minds

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.420
braced for activity.
