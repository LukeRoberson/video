00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:06.469
The theme for this month is, in whom do you trust?

00:00:06.469 --> 00:00:08.070
Do you trust me?

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.470
I hope so.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.470
All of us want to be trusted.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.869
A trust is a basic element of everyday life.

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:18.870
To trust others is a normal reaction.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.469
Many of us have traveled on the train or bus.

00:00:22.469 --> 00:00:27.870
Did we worry whether the conductor or driver would bring a safely to our destination?

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.070
Normally, we do not worry.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.070
We trust an airplane captain to take us safely to our destination.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.070
We trust that when we enter an elevator,

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.070
that it will not crash at the bottom of the shaft,

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.070
but safely take us to the desired floor.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.070
When we marry, we trust that our partner will remain faithful.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.070
In many situations in life, we need trust.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.070
What is trust?

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.070
Trust is the firm belief in the reliability, truth,

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.070
or ability of someone or something.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.069
Webster's dictionary says that it is confidence,

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:11.069
a reliance or resting of the mind on the integrity,

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:14.069
veracity, justice, friendship,

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:18.069
or other sound principle of another person.

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:24.069
Trust is related to confidence, belief, faith, and assurance.

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:29.069
Experiments conducted by Professor Dr. Mikhail Kosfeld,

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:33.069
a professor at a university in Frankfurt, Germany,

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:41.069
led him to the conclusion that trust is a biologically-based part of human nature.

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:46.069
Kosfeld discovered that when there's interaction between two people,

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:51.069
the human brain releases a hormone that stimulates trust.

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:59.069
It is, in fact, one of the distinguishing features of the human species, Kosfeld states.

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:04.069
In everyday life, how discouraged some are if they are not trusted.

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:07.069
The phrase, don't you trust me?

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:12.069
Is frequently heard with an undertone of sadness or complaint?

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.069
Sometimes children or teenagers ask their parents, don't you trust me?

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.069
When the parents place some restrictions on them,

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.069
perhaps in connection with leisure time activities.

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.069
Parents do that because they love you young ones

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:32.069
and want to prevent any spiritual or physical harm before you.

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:38.069
If you cooperate, you will see that parents will gradually trust you ever more

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.069
and grant you more liberty to you.

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.069
You can prove to them that you are trustworthy.

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.069
In the world, many people are not trustworthy.

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.069
Since we are living in the time of the end,

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.069
and the demons are desperate and have influenced many people,

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:02.069
we have to admit that trusting in everybody is not wise.

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.069
Many trusted in religion and were disappointed.

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:11.069
Others trusted in governments or the United Nations, but they were disappointed.

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.069
They trusted political leaders that made all kinds of promises,

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.069
but did not keep all of them.

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:22.069
Some politicians even were exposed as being liars.

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.069
Proverbs 14, 15 says,

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:27.069
the naive person believes every word,

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.069
but the shrewd one ponders each step.

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.069
If somebody, even in the truth, promises as big monetary returns

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.069
if we give him money for his plant investment,

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.069
we need to be careful and not believe every word.

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:48.069
Some that spent their money were in for a disappointment when they learned

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.069
that everything was lost.

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:58.069
We also should not trust everything we read in newspapers or see on television.

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.069
There's another thing we should not trust in.

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.069
Riches.

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.069
Psalm 496 speaks about those who are trusting in their wealth

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.069
and who boast about their great riches.

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.069
Trusting in riches often leads to disappointment.

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:22.069
The one trusting in his riches will fall, says Proverbs 11, 28.

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:27.069
It is not wrong to be rich, just do not trust in riches.

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:31.069
Riches are a risk factor.

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:34.069
Many people today are dishonest and cheat.

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:38.069
Some business owners have installed cameras at the workplace

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:43.069
since they do not trust their employees to put in a full day of work.

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:48.069
They know that some would play video games during work hours.

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:53.069
But Jehovah created us with the inclination to trust.

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:57.069
We can especially trust our spiritual brothers.

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:00.069
True, once in a while such trust is misplaced,

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:07.069
a few commit serious sins and have to be disfellowshipped, but that is rare.

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:12.069
Jehovah himself is the best example of trusting in others.

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:18.069
He trusted the logos to faithfully cooperate with him as the master worker

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:25.069
in creating the universe, the earth, and all the living things on earth, including mankind.

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:28.069
What tremendous trust Jehovah showed in Jesus

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:31.069
when he sent him to the earth.

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:36.069
Jehovah trusted that Jesus would remain faithful and redeem mankind

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:42.069
so that his will and purpose with mankind and the earth could be accomplished.

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:47.069
Jehovah trusted him so much that he arranged for prophecies to be written

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:50.069
that foretold that he would die faithfully.

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:54.069
This trust on the part of Jehovah was not a risk.

00:05:54.069 --> 00:06:01.069
It was based on the collaboration between the two for eons of time.

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:04.069
Think of the prophecy in Psalm 1610,

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:09.069
for you will not leave me in the grave.

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:11.069
Jesus had free will.

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:15.069
This means that theoretically he could have sinned.

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:23.069
If he could not have sinned, Satan would probably not have tried three times to tempt Jesus to sin.

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:29.069
If Jesus could not have sinned, why would he be so heavily distressed in the Garden of Gethsemane

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:31.069
that he was sweating blood?

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:39.069
Why send an angel to comfort and strengthen him if he could not sin or fail anyway?

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:40.069
No question.

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:47.069
Jesus felt the unfathomable load on his shoulders to remain faithful

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:51.069
since not only the salvation of mankind depended on him,

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:55.069
but also the vindication of Jehovah's sovereignty.

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:58.069
He did not want to disappoint Jehovah.

00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:04.069
Jesus used his own free will and was determined to stay loyal.

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:08.069
How glad we are that he did.

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:13.069
On the other hand, Jesus also trusted Jehovah completely.

00:07:13.069 --> 00:07:19.069
He trusted Jehovah that he would resurrect him if he would die faithfully.

00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:23.069
Actually, Jesus was publicly known to trust in Jehovah.

00:07:23.069 --> 00:07:28.069
People that passed by when he was on the torture stake were saying,

00:07:28.069 --> 00:07:34.069
he has put his trust in God, let him now rescue him if he wants him.

00:07:34.069 --> 00:07:37.069
For he said, I am God's son.

00:07:37.069 --> 00:07:40.069
Another example of trust was Abraham.

00:07:40.069 --> 00:07:46.069
When God told him to kill his beloved son Isaac, Abraham was willing to do so.

00:07:46.069 --> 00:07:50.069
He trusted that Jehovah could resurrect him.

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:58.069
Hebrews 11, 19 says, he reasoned that God was able to raise him up even from the dead.

00:07:58.069 --> 00:08:02.069
And he did receive him from there in an illustrative way.

00:08:02.069 --> 00:08:09.069
1 Corinthians 137 says, that love believes all things.

00:08:09.069 --> 00:08:13.069
Love trust that prophecies will come true.

00:08:13.069 --> 00:08:17.069
It also believes what our brothers tell us.

00:08:17.069 --> 00:08:24.069
It also helps to grant others the benefit of the doubt if a matter could be interpreted in different ways.

00:08:24.069 --> 00:08:28.069
Yes, trusting others is an expression of love.

00:08:28.069 --> 00:08:33.070
If you love somebody, you only assume and think the best of him.

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:38.450
Another example of trust in Jehovah was Moses.

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:43.450
He led the nation of Israel out of Egypt into the desert.

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:46.450
A nation of upwards of three million people.

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:50.450
And they had flocks of cattle and sheep with them.

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:57.450
When he left Egypt, did he know how to provide these great crowds with water in the desert?

00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:04.450
Did he know what they would be eating after the initial foodstuffs that they took out of Egypt would run out?

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:09.450
Did he know in advance that Jehovah would miraculously provide the manor?

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:12.450
It doesn't seem so.

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:16.450
But he trusted that Jehovah would take care of the people.

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:22.860
The three friends of Daniel were another fine example of trust.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:28.860
They did not bow and worship in front of an idol that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:34.860
They were told they would be thrown into a fiery furnace if they disobeyed.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:39.860
They remained firm and were protected by an angel,

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.860
so the fire did not do any harm to them.

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:46.860
After that, Nebuchadnezzar then declared,

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:51.860
praised me the God of Shadrach, Mishak and Abednego,

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.860
who sent his angel and rescued his servants.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:58.860
They trusted in him and went against the command of the King

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:03.860
and were willing to die rather than serve or worship any God except their own God.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:08.860
As we are getting ever closer to the great tribulation,

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:14.860
we might be confronted with scary challenges and tests related to nationalism.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:17.860
Will we keep trusting Jehovah?

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:19.860
We trust we will.

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:24.860
Jehovah will miraculously save his people throughout the great tribulation

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.860
and arrange for their survival.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:32.860
Today, the faithful slave was put in charge of providing spiritual food

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:36.860
for God's people who number into the millions.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:41.860
The slave also shows complete trust in Jehovah that he will guide them

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.860
with his Holy Spirit.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:47.860
What makes it possible for the faithful and discreet slave

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:51.860
to provide precious spiritual food?

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:56.860
I will give you insight and structure in the way you should go,

00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:01.860
says Jehovah, Psalm 32, verse 8.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:05.860
Today, Jehovah provides direction to the slave through Jesus.

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:09.860
Jesus, in turn, provides direction for his people through the faithful

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.860
and discreet slave.

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:17.860
We can have, therefore, full confidence in the scriptural insight,

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:22.200
understanding and guidance.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.200
Satan tries to sow mistrust.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.200
Under Communist dictatorship in Romania,

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.200
secret police officers forced a responsible brother

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.200
to walk with them on a heavily frequented street,

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.200
hoping that other brothers would see this

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:41.200
and wrongly conclude that this brother works with a secret police.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.200
Did the scheme work out?

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.200
No, it failed.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:50.200
Brothers did see him but kept trusting him.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:54.200
We learn that we should not quickly lose trust in our brothers.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:12:00.509
Satan also has the scheme to spread rumors about faithful brothers,

00:12:00.509 --> 00:12:03.509
including the faithful slave.

00:12:03.509 --> 00:12:07.509
The method of spreading rumors is not new.

00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:10.509
When Jesus was resurrected and the tomb was empty,

00:12:10.509 --> 00:12:14.509
the soldiers that reported it were told to spread the rumor

00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:18.509
that the disciples came and stole the body at night.

00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:23.509
March 28, 15, relates.

00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:27.509
So they took the silver pieces and did, as they were instructed.

00:12:27.509 --> 00:12:30.509
And this story has been spread abroad among the Jews

00:12:30.509 --> 00:12:33.509
up to this very day.

00:12:33.509 --> 00:12:36.509
Another rumor in the first century was that Christians

00:12:36.509 --> 00:12:39.509
were responsible for the great fire of Rome.

00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:43.509
Could such accusation be true?

00:12:43.509 --> 00:12:47.509
Historians say that it was narrow the emperor

00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:50.509
who set fire to the city.

00:12:50.509 --> 00:12:54.509
Today, rumors are occasionally being spread in electronic form

00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:57.509
about the faithful slave.

00:12:57.509 --> 00:13:00.509
This has caused some concern on the part of some brothers,

00:13:00.509 --> 00:13:04.509
especially when the reports are commenting on court cases

00:13:04.509 --> 00:13:08.509
where some in the organization were accused.

00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:11.509
Sometimes references made to certain quotes

00:13:11.509 --> 00:13:16.509
and readers then think, how can a quote be a rumor?

00:13:16.509 --> 00:13:19.509
A quote can be taken out of context.

00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:23.509
Critical reports often give only part of a matter

00:13:23.509 --> 00:13:26.509
and leave out other aspects.

00:13:26.509 --> 00:13:31.509
Often such rumors play on the emotions.

00:13:31.509 --> 00:13:35.509
Ask yourself, am I prone to believe rumors?

00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:40.509
And even if I am, should I spread it and undermine the trust

00:13:40.509 --> 00:13:44.509
that others have in the slave or in representative

00:13:44.509 --> 00:13:47.509
of the branch office?

00:13:47.509 --> 00:13:50.509
Avoid sensationalism by saying something like,

00:13:50.509 --> 00:13:54.509
can you believe what I heard about this matter or that matter

00:13:54.509 --> 00:13:59.509
or this person or that person referring to a statement

00:13:59.509 --> 00:14:04.509
that may have appeared on Facebook, YouTube or Twitter?

00:14:04.509 --> 00:14:09.509
The spread of rumors is like wildfire that is hard to control.

00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:14.509
It spreads distrust and can undermine someone's faith.

00:14:14.509 --> 00:14:17.509
This is not to say that the slave is perfect

00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:19.509
and never makes mistakes.

00:14:19.509 --> 00:14:23.509
But Jehovah and Jesus trust the imperfect slave

00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:26.509
who cares for things to the best of his ability

00:14:26.509 --> 00:14:29.509
and with the best of motives.

00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:34.950
Shouldn't we then trust the imperfect slave as well?

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:38.950
To appreciate the extent of Jehovah's and Jesus trust

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:43.950
in the faithful slave reflect on what he has promised its members.

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:48.950
He has promised them immortality and incorruption.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:50.950
Soon, just before Armageddon,

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:55.950
the remaining members of the slave will be taken to heaven.

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:57.950
Since 1919 of our common era,

00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:02.950
the slave has been put in charge of some belongings of Christ.

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:05.950
According to Matthew 24, 47,

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:07.950
when the anointed are taken to heaven,

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:09.950
Jesus will, at that point,

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:14.950
entrust all His belongings to them.

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:20.460
Does this not reveal immense trust?

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:24.460
Revelation 4 4 describes these resurrected,

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:27.460
anointed as co-rulers with Christ.

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:33.460
Revelation 22 5 says they will rule not only for a thousand years,

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:37.460
but forever and ever.

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:43.929
What immense trust Jesus shows toward them.

00:15:43.929 --> 00:15:47.929
Since Jehovah God and Jesus Christ completely trust the faithful

00:15:47.929 --> 00:15:49.929
and discreet slave,

00:15:49.929 --> 00:15:51.929
should we not do the same?

00:15:51.929 --> 00:15:57.940
Many servants of Jehovah in the past show trust in Jehovah

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:01.940
when confronted with obstacles or opposition.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.940
We can trust that Jehovah will not let us be tested

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:06.940
beyond what we can bear,

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:13.940
but will provide a way out so we can remain faithful under trials.

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.940
So whom do you trust?

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:22.940
You fully trust in Jehovah, Jesus, and the faithful slave.

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:27.940
To a reasonable degree, you also trust all your fellow brothers and sisters.

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:33.940
The writer of Psalm 142 mentioned something else we need to trust in.

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:35.940
God's Word.

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:40.940
He wrote, for I put my trust in your Word.

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:45.940
The prophecies in God's Word have always come true at the proper time.

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:48.940
Based on that, we can trust fully

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:53.940
that the remaining prophecies pointing to the survival of the great tribulation

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:58.940
and to the paradise to follow will also come true

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:01.940
without the slightest possibility of failure.

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:07.349
Of course, we should trust not only Jehovah, Jesus,

00:17:07.349 --> 00:17:09.349
the faithful slave and the Bible,

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:12.349
but also our fellow brothers.

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:15.349
The Apostle Paul is a fine example of this.

00:17:15.349 --> 00:17:18.349
He wrote in Philemon, or two Philemon,

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:23.349
asking him to kindly receive back the runaway slave

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:26.349
or nesimus that had become a brother.

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:30.349
Paul wrote in Philemon 21,

00:17:30.349 --> 00:17:34.349
I'm confident that you will comply, so I'm writing you,

00:17:34.349 --> 00:17:38.349
knowing that you will do even more than what I say.

00:17:38.349 --> 00:17:42.349
When we speak of trust, we sometimes think of a little child

00:17:42.349 --> 00:17:47.630
a walking hand in hand with his father.

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:51.630
The child does not question whether father will take him.

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:54.630
The child trusts the father.

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:58.630
All throughout the last days, true Christians have faced hostility

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:01.630
of so many in the world.

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:03.630
How strengthening Jehovah's promises

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:07.630
in view of the impending attack by Satan's hordes?

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:12.630
When they attack, Jehovah's people will seem as defenseless,

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:15.630
but we do not need to quake with fear.

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:18.630
We trust that Jehovah, Jesus and the angels

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:21.630
will fight to deliver us.

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:25.630
We will not shrink back in fear.

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:27.630
In Hebrews 10, 39, Paul wrote,

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:31.630
now we are not the sort who shrink back to destruction,

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:35.630
but the sort who have faith for the preserving of our lives.

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:37.630
Today and after Armageddon,

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:42.630
all can say according to Psalm 261 and 52,

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:46.630
8, I have trusted in Jehovah without wavering.

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:51.630
My trust is in God's loyal love forever and ever.

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:54.630
Therefore, keep trusting in Jehovah

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:57.630
and those who are proving loyal to Him.
