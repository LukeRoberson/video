00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:47.899
To Jehovah, Lord, you love we wish to show As a people aided, his command, his advice will never trust him from his side.

00:00:47.899 --> 00:01:20.329
To our brothers, sticking close and times of need, ever-garing, always trusting, ever-kind and word-and-dead.

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:38.150
We show honor to our brothers and respect them from the ever-loyal, ever-closer, from their side we'll never part.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:02:18.240
To their guidance, when our brothers lead the way, when they give us clear direction, may we obey, then the blessing from Jehovah is strong.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:31.900
When we're law-ever-faithful, Jehovah.
