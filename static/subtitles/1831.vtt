00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:06.910
Full-time service is a special way to serve Jehovah with a joy full-heart.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:12.109
But what happens to your joy when you suddenly face a serious trial?

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:15.550
Jay and Elaine Hummer, you have been through this.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.629
Thank you for being here today to share your personal experience with us.

00:00:20.629 --> 00:00:24.910
You've enjoyed full-time service for over 40 years.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.629
Many of those years in the traveling work.

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.309
Yes, we've had a wonderful privilege of both pioneering and serving the

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:33.869
traveling work for 30 years now.

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:38.829
And we really feel Jehovah has been very kind to allow us to serve in this way.

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:44.270
I remember when I first filled out my application for regular pioneering back in 1972,

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.429
and I thought this was my gift to Jehovah, my sacrifice.

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:53.789
But after the many years of the blessings and the privileges and how Jehovah helped us

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.590
through some very difficult times, what I thought was my gift to Jehovah

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.670
turned out to be his gift to me.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.909
This is very encouraging, thank you.

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:05.310
Now you mentioned difficult times.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.950
Is there anything in particular you think of?

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.069
One of the hardest things that we faced was about 20 years ago when we experienced seven deaths

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:15.709
in just a six-month period.

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:20.590
This really was difficult because five of those seven were family members.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.109
Jay's father died.

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:25.950
My aunt Elma, who brought me into the truth, died and my father died.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.950
So it just seemed one layer on top of another.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.989
We can hardly imagine how you must have felt.

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:39.629
Now after such a job-like experience, what did you do in order to regain your joy and happiness?

00:01:39.629 --> 00:01:41.870
Well, it didn't occur automatically.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.909
We kept focused, of course, on serving the friends and working with them.

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.909
And that kept our thoughts from constantly circling around our losses.

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.349
We also thought about the resurrection.

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:54.670
We focused on the resurrection hope.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.310
And as we did, it became like the helmet of salvation,

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.189
protecting our hearts and our thoughts from the grief that we were going through.

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.430
And then, of course, we shared our hope with others.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.669
And that helped us to have it more deeply engraved on our own hearts as well.

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:09.710
Yeah, thank you.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.629
So now, maybe we learned from you what you did in practical terms.

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:19.150
The most difficult of all was about four years after that.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.870
When our beloved nephew, Christopher, was killed in an auto accident at the age of 17.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.270
He and his parents had lived with us in the same house for a number of years before he went on the road.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.069
And we always looked at Christopher like the son that we would never have this side of Armageddon.

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.710
So his death was particularly tragic.

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:41.550
It was excruciating for all of our family members,

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.310
especially his parents.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.870
Christopher was on his way to the Kingdom Hall to meet his papa and his grandmother

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.150
for field service and his car hit a patch of ice and slid into an oncoming car.

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:55.629
He died instantly.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.830
This was so difficult on us.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.189
Our hearts were broken and our spirits were nearly crushed.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.750
It actually rendered me speechless even to bake for the groanings on

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.349
uttered became very difficult.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.710
I didn't speak to Jehovah for three days, but I was listening.

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:15.870
What do you mean by listening?

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.590
I remember when we were all together as a family and my sister just happened to say that

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.189
Christopher had been cremated.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.069
We were there making arrangements for the funeral.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.430
And it just hit me so hard.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.909
It was just it just hit hard enough that I fell down and I just cried.

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:42.430
I laid there on the floor and I thought about perhaps maybe Mary felt this way when she said,

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.110
Lord, if you'd only been here, this wouldn't have happened.

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:52.669
But as I laid there, I could hear my sister say, go get her Bible, read her her favorite

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:54.830
scripture. And so Jay did.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.750
He turned to Psalm 91, a Psalm that I had already memorized.

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:02.750
And now I began to hear Jehovah's voice.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.310
So was this listening to Jehovah a one-time occurrence?

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.789
No, by no means. I really had to now do my research.

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:15.069
So I searched for every article on the resurrection.

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:17.069
I searched for every scripture on comfort.

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:21.389
And I meditated on the artwork, the pictures in the publication.

00:04:22.269 --> 00:04:25.790
I remember one particular scripture that really touched my heart.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.069
It was from Psalm 56 verse 8.

00:04:29.709 --> 00:04:36.910
And in there it said, you keep track of my wandering, do collect my tears from your skin bottle.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.470
Are they not recorded in your book?

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:45.230
And I thought about Jehovah taking such notice of us, keeping track, watching over,

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.470
even collecting every tear and recording each of them.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.430
That truly made me draw close to Jehovah.

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:58.589
So you continued to listen to Jehovah by looking at comforting material

00:04:58.589 --> 00:04:59.870
from the publications.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.910
Was there a specific article you think of?

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:05.149
There was an article.

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:10.750
It was about a delicate flower that had been bent over after a rainstorm.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.389
The kind of cloud burst that would send humans and animals running for shelter.

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:17.069
But not this flower.

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:22.110
Here it was intact, bent over but unbroken and still rooted.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.829
I thought about us in that same way.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.629
The article said that we can no more avoid losing a loved one

00:05:30.269 --> 00:05:33.949
than this flower could uproot itself and run for cover.

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:35.069
It had to endure it.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.389
But the article spoke a great deal about hope and about faith.

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:43.949
Hope is our anchor and hope is our preserver of our spirituality.

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:47.069
And faith, James chapter 1 verse 3,

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:50.430
stated in there that faith, when it succeeds,

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:52.750
we're able to endure.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.470
And so that's exactly what happened.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:56.990
It's softened the grief.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.589
And so like this flower, we too would stand up and smile one day.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:02.110
And we did.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.029
I remember the first time I smiled inside and I thought,

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:09.470
don't Jehovah, you truly are a healer of hearts.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.189
So did you do something else?

00:06:12.829 --> 00:06:16.829
Now I started looking for some of the artwork in the publications.

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:21.709
And one particular picture I found was of a shepherd

00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:24.990
who had gone into a bramble bush and rescued a lamb.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.029
He was lost.

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:30.189
He pulled him out through him over his shoulders and held on to him.

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:34.110
And I thought, what a safe place to be, such security.

00:06:34.829 --> 00:06:39.790
I decided to take the picture and to print it out and just enlarge it a little bit.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.269
But what I didn't see on the publication page,

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:48.829
I saw when I enlarged it and that there were scratches on the shepherd's face.

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:53.709
And I thought what that shepherd had gone through to go in the bramble bush and pull him out.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:07:00.029
And then I thought about Jehovah as our great shepherd and the links that he went

00:07:00.829 --> 00:07:04.110
to rescue us even at the cost of pain for himself.

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:08.269
Now I was listening and drawing back close to Jehovah.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:13.230
So then what did you do with these articles and the pictures?

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:15.709
So now I decided to print them all out.

00:07:15.709 --> 00:07:20.110
The articles, the pictures and the scriptures.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:23.149
And I displayed them on my desk for quite some time.

00:07:23.149 --> 00:07:26.110
But I put them in a big envelope or like a file.

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:29.790
And I thought that was Jehovah's sympathy card to me.

00:07:31.149 --> 00:07:34.670
We knew we had to do something so I was not to be swept away by our grief.

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:38.029
It's been said that grief is an arduous journey,

00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:39.870
but one day we cannot avoid.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:43.389
It's not a place where we live, but a passage as it were.

00:07:43.389 --> 00:07:46.990
And we know that even though grief never goes away, it does change over time.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:51.470
That's because Jehovah made our hearts to heal and so on time.

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:52.350
That's what we did.

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:53.709
Yeah, you sure did.

00:07:53.709 --> 00:07:55.709
It's not about the lack of faith.

00:07:55.709 --> 00:07:57.470
It's simply the price of love.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:59.709
We loved Christopher and we miss him.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:02.430
It wasn't like we were leaving him behind.

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:05.310
Sometimes that's how you feel when you lose a loved one.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.670
But in reality, we know that Christopher is in Jehovah's memory.

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:12.670
And as the righteous God, Jehovah never forgets his loyal ones.

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:13.790
Christopher was one of them.

00:08:14.509 --> 00:08:17.870
So we're confident that we're going to see him again.

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:22.189
And that's what helps us not to be as we're looking always in a rearview mirror,

00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:26.110
but looking ahead to the time when we will be with him in paradise.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:31.949
You know, Jehovah truly kept his promises and he carried us through that storm.

00:08:32.509 --> 00:08:35.710
He gathered up the pieces of our broken hearts and sealed them.

00:08:36.269 --> 00:08:39.549
And even though this happened 17 years ago,

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:42.269
sure, we still have cracks in our hearts,

00:08:42.269 --> 00:08:46.269
but we know for certainty those one day will disappear as well

00:08:46.269 --> 00:08:48.590
in that paradise when we welcome him back home.

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:53.309
And so Jehovah truly proved to be my stronghold,

00:08:54.029 --> 00:08:57.070
my father and my friend in a profound way.

00:08:57.789 --> 00:09:01.629
We learn that Jehovah truly does love us and care,

00:09:01.629 --> 00:09:02.909
protects us.

00:09:02.909 --> 00:09:05.710
And because he is such a good father,

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:09.389
our joy has come back and we have had such a rich life.

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:12.509
So in all the years we've had the privilege of serving our God,

00:09:13.149 --> 00:09:15.950
we've always found it, no matter what we give Jehovah and no matter

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:19.149
what sacrifices we make for him, he always gives us more.

00:09:19.629 --> 00:09:23.149
You can out out generous, the most generous person in the universe.

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:26.669
And so just as he has blessed us all these many years,

00:09:26.669 --> 00:09:31.149
we're confident that he will continue to bless us as we transition to our next assignment.

00:09:32.029 --> 00:09:36.669
Thank you so much for sharing your personal experiences with us.

00:09:36.669 --> 00:09:39.629
And may Jehovah continue to be with the two of you

00:09:39.629 --> 00:09:43.789
as you now continue your full-time service as special pioneers.

00:09:44.429 --> 00:09:48.750
And may you be able to apply the principles that you just mentioned

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:52.509
so that Jehovah can continue to guard your hearts.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:54.429
Thank you.
