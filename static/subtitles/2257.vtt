sports. They can be good for you. In fact, at 1 Timothy 4.8, the Bible says that physical exercise is beneficial.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:25.410
Sports can teach you vital skills, including how to cooperate and communicate with others, but sports can also be bad for you.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.409
It all depends on what you play, how you play, and how much you play.

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:41.409
Consider what you play. At Psalm 11.5, the Bible reminds us that God hates anyone who loves violence.

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:51.409
And some sports are clearly violent. So ask yourself, does it make sense to be entertained by watching others get knocked around?

00:00:52.409 --> 00:01:00.409
Next, consider how you play. At Philippians 2.3, the Bible says, do nothing out of contentiousness or out of egotism,

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:09.409
but with humility, consider others superior to you. Of course, nearly every sport involves a degree of competition,

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.409
but a win and all costs attitude will just take the fun out of the game.

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:26.409
And besides, at probably 1618, the Bible says that pride is before a crash. So ask yourself, do I enjoy playing with overly competitive and prideful people?

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:35.409
Then why would I want to be like that? Finally, consider how much you play sports, or even watch.

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:49.409
At Philippians 1.10, the Bible says, make sure of the more important things. That's good advice, because let's face it, putting too much emphasis on sports is like putting too much salt on your food.

00:01:50.409 --> 00:02:02.409
If you spend too much time watching or playing sports, other things in your life will suffer. That includes your family life, school grades, and the time you need to devote to worship.

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:12.409
In the end, sports shouldn't be the most important thing in your life. Instead, think of it as the reward you get for taking care of your responsibilities first.

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:18.409
That way, you really get the benefits of sports and avoid the pitfalls.
