00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:07.559
It's true, isn't it, that love is a feeling, but it's proved by actions.

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:13.119
So this morning we're considering how our Lord Jesus Christ proved His love by means

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:15.199
of His actions.

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:20.839
Our comments highlight the fact that Jesus did everything within His power to help others

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:22.879
whenever He could.

00:00:22.879 --> 00:00:27.600
While we can learn from that country by doing everything we can to help others under

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:33.479
the past to life and to help them to learn about Jehovah and Jesus.

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:39.520
But when we meditate on the example of Jesus, what are the various ways do we see that

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.880
Jesus showed true love, the Christian love that we should be imitating, the love that

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.920
reflects the love of Jehovah God?

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.240
Well, let's think for a few moments about the various things that proved Jesus love.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.479
The first one, we could say that He showed that He was impartial.

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:02.719
Yes, He didn't put people in boxes, He didn't categorize them, but He viewed them as

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:03.719
individuals.

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.719
Now, it's true, Matthew chapter 11 verse 19, Jesus is accused there of being the friend

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:13.900
of tax collectors and sinners.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.159
And it's true that He associated with many of these people wanting to help them.

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.760
But at the same time, we notice that Jesus was willing to have a meal with a wealthy

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.560
Pharisee.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.760
So that showed us that Jesus didn't just categorize people and say, well, all wealthy people are

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.840
bad or poor people are good, but rather He looked at them as individuals.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.879
Well, isn't that a good lesson for us, not to categorize people by their social status

00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:50.280
or their race or background, but rather to view them as ones that God loves and wants

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.480
to get to know Him?

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.640
So that's one way that we could think about how Jesus displayed true love.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.280
The second way is shown for us in the book of Acts.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.760
If you'd like to turn with me to Acts chapter 3 and verse 26.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:13.960
And mentions, God, after raising up His servant, sent Him to you first to bless you by turning

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.680
each one of you away from your wicked deeds.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.360
So what was this manifestation of love?

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:29.960
Well, Jesus was concerned to help persons to correct their thinking and turn them away

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.759
from doing what is wrong.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.039
Well, do we see how we can imitate Jesus with regard to that?

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:40.800
Yes, it's hard to give persons counsel, isn't it?

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.840
But having the courage to do so is a symbol of love, if it's done in a loving manner.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.479
So correcting persons, perhaps that are going astray,

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:55.719
helping them in the spirit of maleness is a display of Christ-like love.

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:59.840
Also, with whom we study with, it can be difficult,

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.360
or perhaps even embarrassing to raise certain moral issues that need to be discussed.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.759
But people need to be corrected if they really are to come into a good relationship with Jehovah.

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:16.439
So that's another way that we can imitate Jesus' love.

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:22.199
Another way that we could think of is the fact that Jesus always took into consideration

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:26.280
the limitations of His apostles.

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:31.080
Remember that last evening before He was to be executed?

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.400
It was a serious thing for Jesus.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.599
And we could imagine if any of us knew that we were about to be executed within a few hours,

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.879
I don't think many of us would be sleeping, would we be thinking very carefully,

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.680
praying to Jehovah, and that's exactly what Jesus did.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.439
And yet, what happened with the apostles?

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:52.879
Well, they fell asleep, heavily asleep.

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.759
Now, did Jesus reprimand them and just say,

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:58.479
how you're totally wrong?

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:01.120
You should have appreciation for this evening?

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.439
Well, we noticed a comment.

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:06.759
He said, the spirit is eager, but the flesh is weak.

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:10.960
Not that he remembered that it was well after midnight.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.560
They had come, he's full of nice, roast lamb.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.399
Maybe they had three cups of wine.

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:21.759
That's mitigating circumstances, isn't it?

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:30.079
So Jesus took into consideration that there were some factors that perhaps led to them being asleep.

00:04:30.079 --> 00:04:35.959
He also mentioned that there were things that he'd like to express to them that they weren't ready for.

00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:41.079
So he took into consideration their emotional limitations,

00:04:41.079 --> 00:04:44.000
as well as their mental limitations.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.079
And that was mentioned at John chapter 16, verse 12.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:55.959
So with that in mind, how can we imitate the viewpoint that Jesus had and his Christlike love?

00:04:55.959 --> 00:05:05.199
Well, we need to take into consideration the fact that not everybody can do the same things that we do or others do.

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:07.199
We have different limitations.

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:13.519
It could be physical limitations, mental limitations, emotional limitations.

00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:22.959
So by imitating Jesus in this regard, giving our brothers the benefit of the doubt, is a display of Christlike love.

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:31.639
Another aspect we could think of is that Jesus looked beyond the faults and mistakes of his loyal apostles.

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:34.199
He didn't focus primarily on that.

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:41.920
Let's have a look at an amazing example of this is recorded in the book of Luke, Luke chapter 22.

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:51.120
In a doubt, we remember immediately these very comforting words that Jesus mentioned that are recorded in verses 28 and 29.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.319
However, you are the ones who stuck with me in my trials.

00:05:55.319 --> 00:06:01.240
And I make a covenant with you, just as my father has made a covenant with me for a kingdom.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:09.839
What a beautiful expression of confidence that Jesus displayed here in his apostles, his faithful apostles.

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:21.360
But as we read on, notice what Jesus said in verse 31, Simon, Simon, look Satan has demanded to have all of you sift you as wheat.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.240
Then he goes on to say that they would abandon him.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:32.199
This is just after he said, you're faithful, you're sticking with me, he knew that they were going to run away.

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:38.920
Now, of course, in verse 33, Peter says, Lord, I'm ready to go with you both to prison and to death.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:43.360
Now, Jesus probably was thinking, really?

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:52.759
Well, he said, he might tell you, Peter, a rooster will crow today, sorry, will not crow today until you have denied knowing me three times.

00:06:52.759 --> 00:07:01.319
Now, isn't that an amazing thing for us to think of that Jesus knew exactly what was going to happen?

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:07.639
And yet, he still was able to express confidence in their faithfulness.

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:11.120
Now, that means his hope for all of us, too, doesn't it?

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:18.879
It also means that Jesus requires us not to focus on the weaknesses and the mistakes of our brothers and sisters,

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:24.920
but rather on their good intentions and their positive qualities.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:29.279
So it's good for us to ask, what do I focus on?

00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:36.120
Do I focus on the good intentions, look beyond perhaps the mistakes that our brothers make?

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:41.160
Well, if we do so, then we're imitating the love that Jesus displayed.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:48.120
Now, another way we could notice is mentioned for us and recorded in John chapter 17.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:55.639
John 17 and verse 11, this is part of a prayer that Jesus added on that very night before he died.

00:07:55.639 --> 00:07:58.600
He said, I'm no longer in the world, but they are in the world.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:05.040
And I'm coming to you, holy Father, watch over them on account of your own name, which you have given me

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:09.240
so that they may be one, just as we are one.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.639
So Jesus prayed for his apostles.

00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:19.959
He knew that they would have problems, but he prayed for unity, and he prayed that Jehovah would care for them.

00:08:19.959 --> 00:08:21.480
Well, what about us?

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.519
Do we imitate this same type of love?

00:08:24.519 --> 00:08:32.240
It may be very easy for us to pray for our brothers in Venezuela, for our brothers that have been affected by natural disasters,

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:39.039
by our brothers being persecuted, but what about those irritating annoying brothers?

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:42.960
Are we really willing to pray for them?

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:52.120
Well, when we do, and we pray that we're not irritated and annoyed by them, that is also an evidence of Christian love, isn't it?

00:08:52.120 --> 00:09:01.759
And then finally, we could say that Jesus displayed a Christ-like love in a way because he was willing to listen to his apostles,

00:09:01.759 --> 00:09:04.879
to try and find out how they felt about matters.

00:09:04.879 --> 00:09:07.960
Did he really need to have that information?

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:14.840
Not really, but he dignified them by allowing them an opportunity to be able to express themselves.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.919
Remember at one stage, he asked him, who am I?

00:09:18.919 --> 00:09:19.879
What are people saying?

00:09:19.879 --> 00:09:23.159
And then he asked them, who do you think I am?

00:09:23.159 --> 00:09:28.639
With Simon Peter, with regard to the tax question, he asked, what do you think about these taxes?

00:09:28.639 --> 00:09:30.720
Should they be paid or not?

00:09:30.759 --> 00:09:38.039
So Jesus did this to dignify others, and he listened to their answers.

00:09:38.039 --> 00:09:41.320
Well, in a similar way, we should do the same.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:46.000
So just looking at all these various things that we've considered, what did Jesus do?

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
How did he display this love, this true genuine love?

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.879
He did everything he could within his power to help others.

00:09:53.879 --> 00:09:55.639
He didn't put them in boxes.

00:09:55.639 --> 00:09:58.200
He wasn't partial or prejudice.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.840
He helped persons to correct their thinking and turn around.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.279
He remembered their limitations.

00:10:04.279 --> 00:10:10.960
He looked beyond their faults and saw their genuine intentions and their good qualities.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:19.559
He prayed to Jehovah to help them, and he took time to listen and to dignify them by letting them express themselves.

00:10:19.559 --> 00:10:24.960
Well, I'm sure all of us can say there's plenty of room for improvement as far as we're concerned.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:29.840
Yes, we have much to do to imitate the love that Jesus showed us.
