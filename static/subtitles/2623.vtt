00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:09.220
Beginning on October 2012, the Historic Stanley Theater underwent a six-month renovation.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:15.939
Over 2,000 Jehovah's Witnesses from across the United States volunteered on this project.

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:20.179
The Stanley has been used by the witnesses as a venue for their Bible-based seminars

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:22.539
for almost 30 years.

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.539
The latest renovation includes improvements in seating and legroom.

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.260
These enhancements were designed to help audiences benefit more fully from the Bible

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.340
education sessions held here.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.899
The Stanley has been a fixture in the local community since the late 1920s.

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:43.060
In 1981, the theater was put on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.899
This is a theater that was done in the golden age of movie palaces.

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.299
So it is the pinnacle of that building type.

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:53.700
It's got all the bells and whistles.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.979
It had a huge more key out in front on the main street, very elaborate architecture

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:00.539
as you enter the building.

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:01.859
So this was the thing.

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.899
This was quite the place.

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.540
And there was no theater in New Jersey, any more grand.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.859
This was one of the premier theaters in the New York metropolitan area.

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:17.019
Jersey City almost lost this cherished part of its history when the theater closed down

00:01:17.019 --> 00:01:18.700
in 1978.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:25.700
However, in 1983, Jehovah's Witnesses rescued the story theater from disrepair.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.739
It was a need of tremendous amount of repair and restoration when we purchased it.

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:34.620
Just imagine the brass and copper doors that we see around us were covered by many, many

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.620
layers of paint.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:41.219
No one thought they were brass or copper, same with the balcony railings and other artifacts

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:42.219
here.

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:46.859
Shandaliers, the wall sconces, covered with dirt, grime.

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:50.540
No one recognized the burly and some beauty that lead behind it.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.980
So this is a heartening example of what can be done with one of the great buildings

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:05.620
by an organization that's really committed to use it and use it to the maximum without

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.699
destroying its architectural character and adapting its architectural character to current

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:11.699
use.

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:16.180
The Witnesses reopened the Stanley on April 13, 2013.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.139
In the coming year, conventions will be held here in more than 15 different languages,

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:28.300
including American Sign Language, and the Witnesses expect over 250,000 to attend these programs.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.659
New features including the large projection screen and more than 80 television monitors

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:37.819
installed throughout the building enhance program visibility for audiences.

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.900
The builders of the Stanley Theater designed it to be a magnificent public meeting place

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.460
in New Jersey.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.139
Now as an assembly hall of Jehovah's Witnesses, the renovated Stanley Theater is being used

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:51.460
as an elegant and comfortable center for free Bible education.
