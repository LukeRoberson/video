00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:09.869
Greetings, brothers and sisters, and welcome to this update on the global COVID-19 pandemic.

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:15.189
On behalf of the governing body, I want to tell you how encouraged we are when we hear

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:19.710
about your endurance through these difficult times.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.710
In this update, I'd like to speak to you parents who are raising children.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.589
Although all of us have had to stay vigilant to protect ourselves and others, you dear

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:34.950
parents have carried a particularly heavy load.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.390
We can only imagine the deep concern you've had for your young children and teens during

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.869
the pandemic.

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:47.750
You worry about their physical safety and their education?

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.189
You've also been concerned about the emotional impact of physical distancing for many months

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.109
from other children, grandparents, relatives, and the congregation.

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:05.189
And you've handled all of this while you work to provide for them and keep up your family's

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.030
spiritual routine.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.829
That's a lot on your shoulders.

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:18.349
Remember that the prophecy in 2 Timothy chapter 3 tells us that in the last days there

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:23.150
would be critical times hard to deal with.

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.629
So the fact that Satan is attacking the family unit is no surprise to you parents.

00:01:29.629 --> 00:01:36.069
The surprise, however, may be when the attack takes an unexpected form, or perhaps feels

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:40.109
like many attacks coming all at once.

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:42.909
That's what the pandemic has been for many of you.

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:49.030
Now I'm going to say something that you already know.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.989
Your hover guard and Jesus know how you feel.

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:57.109
There are an example leaves no doubt.

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:02.109
For instance, there were times when Jehovah stepped in to protect his son when he was on

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:03.709
the earth.

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:08.909
He first carefully entrusted Jesus to the care of loving parents.

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:14.509
And when Herod wanted to kill Jesus as a child, Jehovah told Joseph and Mary to flee

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:18.150
to Egypt until the threat passed.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.830
He could say it was like an extended lockdown that kept them away from family and friends

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.699
for some time.

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:33.340
Jesus experienced what is really like to grow up as a child in a wicked world.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.180
He knows the pressures and the dangers.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.819
It's no wonder that He took a special interest in children during His ministry.

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:48.990
And today He shares your deep concern for your children.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.909
Would your Christian parents have other good examples to look to?

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:58.629
It's the example of our brothers and sisters who live in areas that have been hit hard

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:01.110
by the pandemic.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:07.710
More recently, this has been the case in India and Brazil.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:13.150
We spoke to parents in those lands and asked them how this has affected their families

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.500
and in particular, their children.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.659
For a child, it's been a whole year without being able to play with other children.

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:29.729
So they really miss being with their friends.

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:34.569
A big challenge that parents have now is coming up with something fun for them to do as

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.530
a family so that their child doesn't feel upset or sad.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.849
They feel anxious to go out and it's very challenging for us to keep them motivated

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:45.409
to stay inside.

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:49.210
Our family was infected with COVID-19.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.969
It was physically and emotionally very stressful for all of us.

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:57.289
We are not able to meet the friends at the Kingdom Hall anymore.

00:03:57.289 --> 00:04:03.860
Neither can we see our relatives, so the kids, they're getting really bored.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.020
Right after the pandemic began, we got the news that Denise had cancer.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.860
Of course, one of our main concerns was our daughter.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:22.139
She really became anxious about what was going to happen to her mom.

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:28.620
Perhaps you can sympathize with some of the challenges parents in India and Brazil are facing.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.579
We know it's not been easy for parents and families during the pandemic.

00:04:33.579 --> 00:04:42.420
But with every trial, there are also opportunities to remain loyal to Jehovah and to grow spiritually.

00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:47.579
For example, many parents have said that they've had more time with their children

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:54.689
to do what it says at Deuteronomy 6 verses 6 and 7.

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:59.610
These words that I am commanding you today must be on your heart.

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:07.329
And you must inculcate them in your sons and speak of them when you sit in your house

00:05:07.329 --> 00:05:14.860
and when you walk on the road and when you lie down and when you get up.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:22.300
Many of us have a more time to sit in our house during the pandemic, whether we wanted to or not.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:29.100
But if this was your circumstance, hopefully you make good use of the opportunity.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:38.259
Jehovah gave the command to Israel because he knew that spiritually strong families would be happy families.

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:40.660
The same is true today.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:48.980
When your family stays close to Jehovah, you bring up blessing to yourself and your congregation.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.620
But you parents are not just caring for your children's spiritual needs.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.579
You have spiritual needs too.

00:05:56.579 --> 00:06:05.379
Jehovah's command in Deuteronomy 6 said that Israelite parents must have his words on their heart.

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:11.139
Notice the benefit you gain when you make time for your spirituality.

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:16.579
Proverbs 20 and verse 7 explains it this way.

00:06:16.579 --> 00:06:20.819
The righteous one is walking in his integrity.

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:26.970
Happy are his children who come after him.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:32.620
So righteous parents make for happy children.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.779
Parents, we know that you know these things.

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:46.420
We commend you for what you're doing and we're praying for Jehovah's Holy Spirit to give you strength even when you feel tired out.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:52.259
Our spiritual routine is even more important when we're being tested.

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:57.620
The families we met from India and Brazil were aware of this too.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:06.500
They shared what they've done to adapt their spiritual routine to meet the challenge of the pandemic.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:12.259
We go out in the ministry together as a family much more often than we did before.

00:07:12.259 --> 00:07:14.420
Saturday is a special day for us.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:20.899
We work together as a family every Saturday morning and we make plans with other families

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:23.699
who are also close friends of our children.

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:28.100
We always have a very enjoyable time.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:34.579
When we conduct our Bible studies we have them sit in the kids watch us closely

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:36.579
and they learn from us.

00:07:36.579 --> 00:07:40.420
Family worship has played a very important role.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.860
It's a relaxed atmosphere in which we can have a good time.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:47.459
One of the games we play is you name a Bible character

00:07:47.459 --> 00:07:54.500
and the next person has to come up with someone whose name starts with the last letter of the name that was just said.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.779
This way the kids are getting to know new Bible characters

00:07:57.779 --> 00:08:00.100
and they're learning a lot about them.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.139
One of our projects is a model of Noah's Ark.

00:08:03.139 --> 00:08:07.220
Our kids have learned almost all the original songs.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:12.740
We've played a few games using some of the activities on JW.org.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.980
We met some models of Bible accounts,

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:19.459
be enacted Bible seeds and rule plays of Bible characters.

00:08:19.459 --> 00:08:25.300
It was one time that we wrapped our son in toilet paper and he was Lazarus.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:29.060
And we have considered timely articles appearing on JW.org.

00:08:29.139 --> 00:08:32.740
We also did a project on the metal image of Daniel's prophecy.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:38.980
Our son enjoys family worship because we do things that he likes,

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:42.100
something that holds his attention and it's fun.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:45.299
And seeing them happy makes us happy.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:06.830
All this has got us close to each other and it also helps us to draw closer to each other.

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:15.200
With JW's help we can get through anything.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.600
Perhaps something those families are doing

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.679
can work or is already working for your family.

00:09:21.679 --> 00:09:27.759
Let's review some suggestions that can help your family's spiritual routine.

00:09:27.759 --> 00:09:33.919
For families with young children, dramatize Bible scenes.

00:09:33.919 --> 00:09:37.120
Your children may like to dress up and make props

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:42.399
to bring the account to life and remember the lessons.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.480
And the good thing is you don't need expensive props to make this interesting.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.759
Play memory games.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:54.080
This could be based on recent points from the meetings

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.159
or something they've been reading or watching on JW Broadcasting.

00:09:59.679 --> 00:10:04.240
Try a JW.org activity for children together.

00:10:05.519 --> 00:10:08.799
These are under the Bible Teaching section of the website.

00:10:09.759 --> 00:10:14.080
But if you have young children, I suspect you've been there before.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:18.480
And here are some ideas for families with teens.

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:22.720
Practice what if situations.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.600
Perhaps let your teen choose a situation they're concerned about.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:33.279
Talk about goals. These can be short-term or long-term goals.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.879
Let your teen tell why they chose the goal.

00:10:37.519 --> 00:10:40.240
And what steps they feel will help them reach it.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.840
Read or watch a life story.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.480
Again, let your teen choose a life story of someone they're interested in.

00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:54.159
Remember though, that you don't have to use every suggestion.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:01.759
Talk to your family, pray about it, and try what you think can make a difference for you.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:08.240
And of course, there's nothing wrong with watching JW Broadcasting during a family worship.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.639
After all, that's why we're here.

00:11:10.639 --> 00:11:16.720
But when you do, try to make it more than just watching TV.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.960
Take time to talk about the programmers of family.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.960
Either at the end of the broadcast or after each segment.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.559
Those are the suggestions.

00:11:28.559 --> 00:11:32.559
Now here are the necessities for your family.

00:11:33.039 --> 00:11:36.000
Pray together every day.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.399
Try to include the feelings and concerns of each family member.

00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:43.360
Keep attending the meetings.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:47.440
Help each other to pay attention and participate.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:53.440
Unlike being in the kingdom hall, we may have many distractions when we attend from home.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.799
Share in the ministry together.

00:11:56.799 --> 00:12:01.440
As the pandemic continues to limit how we do our preaching work,

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.279
talk about the different forms of the ministry you can do,

00:12:05.919 --> 00:12:08.399
and how each family member feels about them.

00:12:09.519 --> 00:12:12.720
Listen and encourage everyone to do their best.

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:20.179
Finally, we urge your parents to keep doing what you already know is vital.

00:12:21.059 --> 00:12:26.419
Be alert for signs that your children are struggling with negative emotions or stress.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:31.059
If you sense that they are, please read the article,

00:12:31.059 --> 00:12:34.019
help your children cope with stress.

00:12:34.019 --> 00:12:41.220
It's in the awake of July 22, 1993, pages 10 and 11.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:45.220
There you'll find wonderful suggestions on what you can do.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:48.980
Jehovah loves your family.

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:54.019
He knows what you're contending with, and he wants to help you.

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:59.779
The pandemic has been just one of many tests we'll face in the last days.

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.059
Now that's an ornament to discourage you.

00:13:03.059 --> 00:13:04.580
It's just reality.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:11.700
But with Jehovah's help, your family can come out of each test spiritually stronger

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.779
and more prepared to face what's ahead.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:21.539
Jeremiah chapter 17 gives us this beautiful assurance in verse 7.

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:29.940
Blessed is the man who puts his trust in Jehovah, whose confidence is in Jehovah.

00:13:31.539 --> 00:13:33.379
And verse 8 concludes saying,

00:13:34.659 --> 00:13:41.379
And in the year of drought, he will not be anxious nor will he quit producing fruit.

00:13:42.659 --> 00:13:47.539
Of course, we also want these tests to end, and they will.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:51.620
Well, when you look back at the pandemic from the new world,

00:13:52.259 --> 00:13:56.419
you will see momentary and light, even if it doesn't seem so now.

00:13:57.779 --> 00:14:01.779
In the meantime, we continue to pray for all of you,

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:06.980
parents, children, and all in our worldwide spiritual family.

00:14:07.779 --> 00:14:11.220
May Jehovah bless your love and endurance.

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:18.179
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.
