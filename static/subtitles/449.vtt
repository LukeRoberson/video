WEBVTT

00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:07.690
And we are at war, and that is very clear, so for all of us, we have to protect ourselves

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.150
from Satan and the demons, and the spiritual fight is on to the finish.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.589
Working out our salvation with fear and trembling is essential.

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:21.370
Let's open our Bibles to Revelation chapter 12, and let's learn why, what why the devil

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:26.050
is so infuriated, why he hates Jehovah's servants.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:34.689
We're going to focus first on Revelation chapter 12, but verse 11, verse 11.

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:41.369
And they, that's the anointed remnant, conquered him, that's the devil.

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:42.530
He hates that.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.409
The anointed, conquer Satan, the devil.

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:50.770
They prove him to be a liar, their loyal, their integrity keepers, their conduct, their

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.170
words, everything that they do, conquers the devil.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.789
And yet in addition to that, in addition to their faith in the ransom, verse 11 goes

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.290
on to say something else, which truly infuriates the devil.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:12.930
It says, they conquer him by their word of their witnessing, Matthew 24, 14, the preaching

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:21.250
activity, notice, there is a direct connection between conquering Satan and our preaching activity.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.129
That's what he hates, and that is why he relentlessly attacks our preaching

00:01:25.129 --> 00:01:28.890
activity and tries to stir up opposition.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.930
He's conquered by means of the preaching work.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.969
But Satan's opposition to our preaching work is nothing new.

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:42.489
Let's open our Bibles to Amos chapter 7, and note some striking similarities between

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:49.489
our day and Amos day, Amos chapter 7.

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:54.810
Now this is when Jehovah God sent Amos to the 10 tribe kingdom of Israel, Jeroboam was

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.489
the king, and he put calf worship there in a city called Bethel, and calf worship was

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:05.650
now a part of the religion there at the 10 tribe kingdom.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.849
So now Amos finds himself right in the middle of that situation, but let's see what happens,

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:21.810
how they opposition mounts, and how it's similar in our day, verse 10, Amozaya, the priest

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.129
of Bethel.

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:27.810
So Amozaya is the priest of the state religion of calf worship.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.610
Bethel is the center of apostate religion.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.370
What does Amozaya do?

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.370
He sends a message to King Jeroboam of Israel.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:45.530
Notice now how the religious entity Amozaya sends the message to the state over to the government

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.849
to King Jeroboam and gets him all worked up.

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:56.090
And he says, Amos is conspiring against you, right in the midst of the house of Israel,

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:02.650
the land cannot put up with all his words, conspiring against Jeroboam.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.370
This was an act of treason.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:12.490
So you see this lying report when straight to Jeroboam from Amozaya, the priest.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.449
But now see what happens here in verse 11.

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:23.050
He stirs up opposition true, but now notice the three misleading statements of that Amozaya

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.610
accuses Amos of.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.889
One, for this is what Amos says, that's not true.

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:33.129
Amos didn't say that.

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.050
Amos always said, this is what Jeroboam wants me to say.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.770
This is what Jeroboam commanded me to say.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.650
But Amozaya just says, this is what Amos said, misleading.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.930
Number two, Jeroboam will die by the sword.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.370
Amos never said that.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:57.770
You see, Amos said that it was Jeroboam's house, his dynasty, or his posterity that would

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:58.770
die.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.689
So again, a misleading, distorted way of presenting matters.

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:12.250
Number three, Israel will surely go into exile from its land, however, Amozaya does not

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.490
add that Amos was trying to help people.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:21.089
Amos was trying to turn people to Jerhovogad, served Jerhovogad, and you'll get a blessing,

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:24.170
do what Jerhovog wants you to do, and you'll have his favor.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.370
So Amozaya doesn't touch that.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.209
He doesn't say anything positive that Amos is doing.

00:04:30.209 --> 00:04:36.649
So you see, these are the three things that Amozaya was doing and accusing Amos of.

00:04:36.649 --> 00:04:42.209
Three misleading statements, distorted half truths in an effort to get the official

00:04:42.209 --> 00:04:46.850
ban on the preaching activity of Amos.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.850
Do we see something similar today?

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:56.569
We note striking similarities between the methods of Amozaya and those employed by the

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:01.850
opposers of Jerhovogad, of Jerhovogad's people.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:08.810
Just as Amozaya tried to silence Amos, so certain religious leaders today do the same.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.889
They try to block the preaching work of Jerhovogad's servants.

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:18.569
Amozaya falsely accused Amos of treason today.

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:26.540
Some religious leaders falsely accused Jerhovogad's people of being a threat to national security.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:33.540
Just as Amozaya turned to the king, Jeroboam, to help in opposing Amos, so religious leaders

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:41.100
today are often turned to political allies in an effort to support their persecution

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.420
of Jerhovogad's witnesses, striking similarities.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:50.339
When it comes to the preaching work, you see the devil hates it.

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:53.100
What would Amos do?

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:58.779
What he backed down, what he'd be intimidated, what he'd cower in fear, what he'd run away

00:05:58.779 --> 00:05:59.779
from his assignment.

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:02.620
He was just a shepherd boy.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:09.100
He was a one who took care of figs, and he was a herdsman, and here he's taken from

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.740
his little bleak surroundings, and he's put right in the middle of this hotbed of activity

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.540
there at Bethel, a post-ate center.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:21.899
It's interesting that he didn't go off into some area where there were no people, but

00:06:21.899 --> 00:06:26.779
he was right there at the nerve center, this little humble modest man.

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:29.860
Amos, we don't know much about him.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.139
He's not impressive, but his message is impressive.

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:42.019
And more importantly, you see how Jehovah emboldened him with his Holy Spirit to be valiant

00:06:42.019 --> 00:06:45.699
and courageous in the middle of this situation.

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:47.339
So let's see what Amos says.

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:49.579
What did he do?

00:06:49.579 --> 00:06:52.660
Verse 16.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.500
So now here, the word of Jehovah.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.579
Now Amos is saying this to Amos, I hear the word of Jehovah again.

00:06:59.579 --> 00:07:01.420
He gives Jehovah all the credit.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.939
It's not me.

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:06.579
It's Jehovah asked me to do this, Amozaya.

00:07:06.579 --> 00:07:10.779
It says, if a lion roars, who would not be afraid?

00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:14.220
Jehovah speaks, I'm going to spring into action.

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.459
So this is the word of Jehovah.

00:07:16.459 --> 00:07:21.699
You are saying to me, do not prophesy against Israel, do not preach against the house of

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:26.180
Jacob or the descendants of Jacob, which would have been that ten tribe.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.699
And Amos says, I can't do that.

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:31.139
I cannot stop.

00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:34.019
This commission comes from Jehovah God.

00:07:34.019 --> 00:07:35.500
Does he cower?

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:36.500
No.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:44.019
In fact, verse 17, therefore, this is what Jehovah says, Amozaya, your wife will become a prostitute

00:07:44.019 --> 00:07:45.019
in the city.

00:07:45.019 --> 00:07:50.579
Now, that would mean that his wife would be violated by the soldiers of a conquering

00:07:50.579 --> 00:07:51.579
army.

00:07:51.579 --> 00:07:55.819
Your sons, your daughters will fall by the sword, you yourself are going to be buried

00:07:55.819 --> 00:07:58.939
on unclean land that's outside of Israel.

00:07:58.939 --> 00:08:00.740
That's what I have to say.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:01.740
Checkmate.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.740
It's amazing.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:04.740
Amos.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:10.740
Really, when you think about this man and how he just wanted to do Jehovah's work, Jehovah's

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.060
will, he was not intimidated.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.579
And neither are we.

00:08:15.579 --> 00:08:20.779
When it comes to speaking Jehovah's word, we will not disobey Jehovah God, even in

00:08:20.779 --> 00:08:26.139
the lands where we have these modern day Amozaya's fomenting cruel persecution.

00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:32.100
Like Amos, we keep on proclaiming, this is what Jehovah says.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:36.179
Well, Jehovah God tried to help those Israelites.

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:38.100
He tried to help them change their ways.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.980
He used Amos to preach to them.

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.620
And today, look at us.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:47.220
Look at Jehovah's people, earthwide, trying to help people.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.860
And the devil hates this work.

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:49.860
That's the point.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:54.100
Okay, because it conquers him, the faithful slave is successful.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:59.620
Look at what the anointed are doing in fulfilling Matthew 24, 14.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:00.980
What is our role at Bethel?

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:04.259
Why are we talking about this to the Bethel family?

00:09:04.259 --> 00:09:06.500
Because we are the support group.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.139
We are kingdom support services.

00:09:09.139 --> 00:09:15.019
In any war, in any war, we have to have a supply line.

00:09:15.019 --> 00:09:19.659
If that supply line is cut off from the front lines, those front lines people are

00:09:19.659 --> 00:09:21.019
in trouble.

00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:26.580
And in any war, the idea is to cut off, the enemy wants to cut off that supply line.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.379
Wants to sever the supply line.

00:09:28.379 --> 00:09:30.539
It demoralizes the troops.

00:09:30.539 --> 00:09:31.580
That's our job.

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:33.940
We are the supply line.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:38.340
Kingdom support role is vital as we serve at Bethel.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:43.899
It's a noble, honorable work to help the preaching work continue to move forward.

00:09:44.899 --> 00:09:52.899
Now as we look at chapter 4, Jehovah is such a god of kindness and mercy in chapter 4.

00:09:52.899 --> 00:09:58.899
Jehovah repeatedly recounts how he tried to help his people.

00:09:58.899 --> 00:09:59.899
He sent Amos.

00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:05.940
He tries to correct them and chastise them and he sends Amos back over and over again.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.860
And there's this reoccurring theme.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:11.820
Five times he reminds them how he tried to help them.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:16.460
And five times you did not come back to me.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.340
You ten tribe kingdom, you did not come back to me.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.539
I tried to help you.

00:10:20.539 --> 00:10:22.259
You did not come back to me.

00:10:22.259 --> 00:10:23.899
You did not come back to me.

00:10:23.899 --> 00:10:25.379
You did not come back to me.

00:10:25.379 --> 00:10:27.100
I'm trying to help.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.100
You didn't come back to me.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.059
So there's only one option.

00:10:31.059 --> 00:10:33.100
You leave me one decision to make.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:37.740
It's military confrontation and that's the way it will be in our day.

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:39.379
There's one option.

00:10:39.379 --> 00:10:45.379
Military confrontation because people will not come back to Jehovah then what will happen

00:10:45.379 --> 00:10:48.700
Chapter 4 verse 12.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.700
Get ready to meet your God.
