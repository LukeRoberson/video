00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.910
From ancient times, Jehovah's people have had established places of worship.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.910
That pattern has continued down to our time.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:19.690
Today, we meet in Kingdom Halls around the world.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:26.690
It's here that we receive spiritual refreshment and direction through Jehovah's organization.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:33.689
And it's here that we enjoy encouraging association with our brothers and sisters.

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:36.689
But our Kingdom Halls do something else.

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:41.689
They are centers for pure worship in the local communities.

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:44.689
In Indonesia, where I live,

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:52.689
our congregation invited local government officials and neighbors to an open house of our Kingdom Hall prior to the dedication.

00:00:52.689 --> 00:01:00.689
The mayor attended and he was impressed by the quality of the building, its functionality, and its beautiful garden.

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:08.099
He said, the cleanliness of this hall reflects your true faith.

00:01:08.099 --> 00:01:14.099
That comment made us feel so proud to be serving our God, Jehovah.

00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:21.099
Experiences like these remind us never to take our places of worship for granted.

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:27.099
So how can we personally show Jehovah our gratitude for our Kingdom Halls?

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:42.609
When our Kingdom Halls are kept clean and tidy, it reflects the qualities and personality of the God we worship, a God of order.

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:48.609
Regular cleaning also helps protect the health of all those attending.

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:54.609
Additionally, regular maintenance helps prolong the existence of the building itself.

00:01:54.609 --> 00:02:00.299
While congregations primarily are responsible for maintenance,

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:09.300
LDC representatives can assist where needed and train others how to care for inspections and repairs safely.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.300
Remember, one should never do any risky work at the Kingdom Hall alone.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.300
And always follow safety instructions.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:27.789
When problems are identified early, they can be corrected with less time and money.

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:34.490
We honor Jehovah when we use donated resources wisely.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.490
Much as we do when making donations in the first place.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:46.490
In Bible times, when funds were needed to renovate the house of Jehovah, many happily responded.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.490
Whether they had little or much, they donated generously.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.490
Our Kingdom Halls are more than just buildings.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.490
They are places of worship dedicated to Jehovah.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:07.169
And by caring for them, in the best way we can,

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:14.169
we show love for our brothers, new ones, and most of all, Jehovah.

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:20.169
The one who lovingly provides his people with beautiful places of worship.
