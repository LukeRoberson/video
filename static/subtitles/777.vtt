00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:09.949
In recent years, a very popular feature has been added to the Gilead graduation programs

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:15.470
and that's allowed us to get to know some of the students a little bit better.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.750
The Inside Story.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.949
So this time, the Inside Story, the interviews are conducted by one of the instructors,

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.750
Brother Trent Lippold.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:52.740
Let's watch.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.259
Welcome to The Inside Story.

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:59.179
We look forward to getting acquainted with two couples from the 154th class.

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:04.620
Life is full of difficult decisions and that's true of course of our Gilead students as well.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.459
So what can stabilize us?

00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:10.540
What can help us be successful when making such hard decisions?

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.099
First Corinthians chapter 8 verse 1 tells us that love builds up.

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:33.829
So let's see how this has proved true for the couples that we'll talk to today.

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:35.349
Brother and sister Sylvester, welcome.

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:37.709
It's nice to have you on The Inside Story today.

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:40.909
We're both coming to us from Britain and you're in the branch in Britain.

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.310
Can you tell us what your assignments are first, Steve?

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.909
So I'm currently working with the service department, okay, and Gail Marie.

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.510
And I'm in the dental department.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.709
Okay.

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:51.709
So how did you get to Bethel?

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:54.590
What brought you to serve in Bethel, Steve?

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.870
Well my mum and my dad, he wasn't in the true, so my mum, she brought myself and my brother

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.390
up and she always encouraged the full-time ministry.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.629
It was something that she focused a lot on.

00:02:06.629 --> 00:02:09.789
That is a picture of my mum there.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.310
This was a congregation trip that we went on to visit some brothers in Italy.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.750
I think I was about 12, I was a tall 12-year-old.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.310
But actually this picture typifies the type of environment my mum wanted us to be in

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.349
because she always sort of immersed us in theocratic activities.

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:29.349
Nice.

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.110
So she really applied the council to train up a boy.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.110
Yes.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:39.229
When I was 19, I had the opportunity to apply for Bethel service and was invited in.

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:40.229
Very nice.

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:42.389
We have a picture here of, is this, this is you?

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:44.830
Yeah, that was me with the transport department.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.430
I was a truck driver.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.669
So we got to travel all over the country, so we just loved my assignment, loved the brothers

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:54.389
I worked with, just loved the whole Bethel environment.

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:57.710
And you got to wear a blue blazer, indeed.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.509
So you're living your dream, you're there in Bethel, but you had some changes in your

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:03.509
life.

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:06.550
What circumstances changed for you that led you out of Bethel?

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.710
So it got to a point where my mum's health wasn't so good.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.590
So I needed to make a decision, what do I do, do I stain Bethel, can I support her in

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.590
some way?

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.090
I mean, my brother, I mean, he was excellent, but he was now married, he had a family

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.189
in the south of England, so I made the decision to leave Bethel.

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:35.509
In doing so, we started courting, we got married, sadly, my mum, she did pass away, and

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:39.270
then we had the opportunity to return to Bethel service.

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.150
Wow, second time, well, it's a very responsible decision that you made.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.509
So what did you think of that, Kimmery, was Bethel a goal of yours?

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:48.509
Not at all.

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:50.789
I never desired to go to Bethel.

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:56.750
I was quite happy pioneering in our little territory in London, but something that made

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.229
me change my thinking was before Steve's mum died.

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:10.270
She said to us that if we had the health, the strength to do more for Jehovah, do it.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:15.270
So although Bethel wasn't something that I had ever thought about doing, we tried it.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.230
A year later, we were in Bethel together.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.910
Yeah, those are very wise words, and I think you had a photo here of, so this is your

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:21.910
Bethel experience.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.509
Yes, so some of the housekeepers that I worked with, they were very encouraging, very

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:29.509
supportive, helped me through my first few months of Bethel.

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:31.509
A serious group, it looks like.

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:33.189
Yeah, so we had some fun.

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:34.189
Very nice.

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:38.990
So you're back living your dream then, Steve, back in Bethel, but again, change came along.

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.990
It did.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:45.509
So like you said, it was like living the dream, but then my dad's situation changed.

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:49.550
And that was a difficult one because my dad, he wasn't in the truth.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:55.230
But one of the things my mum had said was actually the week before she passed away, she

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.870
just looked at me and said, please look after your dad.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:06.629
So we talked about it, we prayed about it, and then we made the decision to leave Bethel,

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:09.430
which was a difficult decision to make.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.230
But very, I mean, those are two responsible, very responsible decisions you've made.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.750
But what did you think, Gilmory?

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.029
Yeah, we were both disappointed.

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:23.589
We were upset to leave Bethel, but we knew it was the right thing to do to support his

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:24.589
dad.

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:26.949
Can I ask, how old were you at this time?

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:29.110
So we were nearly 35.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.829
OK, so that's a pivotal point for you then, what was going through your mind?

00:05:32.829 --> 00:05:37.949
Yeah, so now we're thinking, we're at the age where it's unlikely that we'll be able to

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:41.310
return to Bethel's service or to be able to focus on a goal like that.

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.389
But nevertheless, we thought this is the right thing to do.

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:46.750
Good. So how did things turn out for you then?

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.350
You're back pioneering in the territory, caring for your dad.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.709
Yeah, so we're in the territory, right in the centre of the territory.

00:05:53.709 --> 00:05:59.470
And once we got over the initial disappointment of leaving Bethel, we really enjoyed our

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:04.149
pioneer ministry, loving being with the congregation.

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:05.149
We were busy.

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:06.149
We were busy.

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:07.149
Very busy.

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:08.829
What happened next?

00:06:08.829 --> 00:06:14.949
So one morning, the postman comes and in the post was this white envelope.

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:21.310
And it was an invitation for us to begin training for substitute circuit work.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:22.310
So we were shocked.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.509
We didn't see that one coming.

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:30.790
Again, after talking about it, praying about it, we accepted the assignment and began

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:35.629
substitute work, which was nice because you know, we could be flexible with our work.

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:39.110
Obviously, it's not every week, so it was a nice assignment.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.509
It suited us well.

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:43.310
And I guess suited also for taking care of your father.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.589
Yeah, yeah, it enabled us to be able to do both.

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:48.310
But you didn't stay in the substitute work, did you?

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.310
Not for very long.

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:50.310
No.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:51.310
Eight months.

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.910
So eight months down the line, we received another white envelope.

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:57.910
Is that postman again?

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.230
So he turns up with another white envelope.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:06.310
And this time, it's inviting us to train for regular circuit work.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:08.110
What did you think of that, Gilmoury?

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:13.589
So again, it wasn't my natural desire, never thought about circuit work.

00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:17.910
Traveling didn't necessarily appeal to me, living out of a suitcase, staying in people's

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:19.910
homes.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:22.310
These were all things that were on my mind.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:27.470
But again, Steve's mum's words rang in my head that if you have the health strength,

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:32.389
circumstances, to do something more for Jehovah, then try it.

00:07:32.389 --> 00:07:36.750
But Hans, I mean, that must have been a bit of a concern for you, because you're going

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:41.750
into the regular circuit work, but you still have your dad to take care of, correct?

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:47.470
Yeah, it was a big concern, because of course, except in a circuit assignment, we could

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:50.350
be assigned anywhere in our branch territory.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.589
So we knew that was a possibility.

00:07:52.589 --> 00:07:56.709
But again, you trust in Jehovah, and that's what we did.

00:07:56.709 --> 00:08:03.509
So when we did receive our first circuit assignment, Jehovah certainly didn't let us down, because

00:08:03.509 --> 00:08:10.470
our first assignment was in London, and it covered the area where my dad actually lived.

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.149
So we were able to accept the assignment.

00:08:12.149 --> 00:08:15.189
Well, what a great benefit from tasting and seeing.

00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:20.470
But then in circuit work, of course, a few years will go by, and you'll be moved.

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:24.509
So what happened with your next circuit?

00:08:24.509 --> 00:08:29.430
Sadly, unexpectedly as well, my dad passed away, so we didn't see that coming.

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:35.669
So once we dealt with that, we were then able to take up a circuit assignment wherever

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:37.870
the branch assigned us.

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:41.629
And eventually, we were assigned to Scotland, beautiful Scotland.

00:08:41.629 --> 00:08:42.629
How did you enjoy?

00:08:42.629 --> 00:08:43.990
How did you both enjoy Scotland?

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.990
Loved it.

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:45.990
Loved Scotland.

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:46.990
Yeah.

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:47.990
The people very friendly.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:49.909
Obviously, the brothers and sisters very friendly.

00:08:49.909 --> 00:08:55.590
The ministry was quite easy, because you could start conversations very easily.

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:56.590
But we loved it.

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:58.029
We loved serving in Scotland.

00:08:58.029 --> 00:09:02.549
It seems to be a recurring theme now, though, because I know you're just enjoying this

00:09:02.549 --> 00:09:07.549
assignment, which almost means now it's time for a change for the two of you.

00:09:07.549 --> 00:09:09.669
How did your next change come about?

00:09:09.669 --> 00:09:11.070
No white envelope this time.

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:12.070
Okay.

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:13.269
But you were getting afraid of those.

00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:14.269
I was getting afraid of that.

00:09:14.269 --> 00:09:17.990
I stopped making eye contact with the postman.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:24.149
But I received the phone call one Tuesday morning in the middle of his traditional Scottish

00:09:24.149 --> 00:09:25.149
breakfast.

00:09:25.149 --> 00:09:26.149
Yeah.

00:09:26.149 --> 00:09:28.909
Not a great time, because I was focused.

00:09:28.909 --> 00:09:34.470
And I took the phone and he began the conversation by saying, are you sitting down?

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:37.830
So I'm thinking, oh boy, what's he going to say?

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:43.669
And that he invited us to return to Bethel once again.

00:09:43.669 --> 00:09:45.590
So my next question was, well, when would you like us in?

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:49.990
A couple of weeks from now, the answer will actually, if you can come in this Friday, that

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:51.149
will be better.

00:09:51.149 --> 00:09:57.870
So after some negotiation, we managed to negotiate the following Monday as the date that we return

00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:58.870
to Bethel.

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:02.870
I keep asking you the same question, Gallery, but how did you react to the phone call?

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:08.990
So as much as I loved circuit work, I was super excited to go back to Bethel.

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:10.230
I was so excited.

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:12.990
I packed my bags on the same day.

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:14.149
Wow.

00:10:14.149 --> 00:10:19.429
Well, you've had a lot of ups and downs in your life.

00:10:19.429 --> 00:10:20.830
You were in Bethel.

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:23.350
You had to leave because of your mom.

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:24.830
You go back into Bethel as a couple.

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:27.070
You have to leave.

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:29.110
Death of your father, circuit work.

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:32.830
What would you say are some things that have helped stabilize you when you've had

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:35.110
to make such heavy decisions?

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:39.909
I think having good people around, so like I mentioned before, my mum always immersed

00:10:39.909 --> 00:10:46.110
us with good associations, so those brothers that were an integral part of my life, their

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:48.470
influence was certainly there.

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:54.230
My own brother, he was always very stable spiritually, so his example helped me.

00:10:54.230 --> 00:11:00.870
I've got images of my mum in my mind of being sat at our kitchen table, her watch tower,

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:03.789
her drawer close to Jehovah, bought the market pens.

00:11:03.789 --> 00:11:04.789
She was a student.

00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:05.789
She's like a brilliant student.

00:11:05.789 --> 00:11:06.789
She's like a brilliant student.

00:11:06.789 --> 00:11:13.470
Yeah, and I think having that influence, that good example helped me then to maintain

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:14.470
that focus.

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:15.470
Nice, yeah.

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:19.629
Family, if you have it, can be a real blessing in that way spiritually.

00:11:19.629 --> 00:11:20.629
What about for you, Gail Marie?

00:11:20.629 --> 00:11:23.750
What's helped you in making these difficult decisions?

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:30.830
So like Steve, my parents, both my parents, raised all of the siblings in the

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:31.830
truth.

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:38.230
They always helped us to set theocratic goals, even with all the changes that we've had.

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:42.509
They weren't able to see us all the time because of the different places we were, but

00:11:42.509 --> 00:11:46.389
they were never demanding, always very supportive, very encouraging.

00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:51.549
But also my grandparents, they supported myself and the rest of the family.

00:11:51.549 --> 00:11:52.549
You have this great picture.

00:11:52.549 --> 00:11:53.549
Yeah.

00:11:53.549 --> 00:11:54.549
So this is my grandparents.

00:11:54.549 --> 00:11:59.710
Unfortunately, my grandma died before we came to the school, but Granddad is still going.

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:03.629
He's 95, still faithfully serving Jehovah.

00:12:03.629 --> 00:12:07.149
He's always been a real good support for myself and the rest of the family.

00:12:07.149 --> 00:12:08.149
Oh, that's beautiful.

00:12:08.149 --> 00:12:13.029
I wonder, you know, even today, I wonder what he would say to you right now if you were

00:12:13.029 --> 00:12:14.029
here.

00:12:14.029 --> 00:12:15.029
Yeah.

00:12:15.029 --> 00:12:22.549
Steve and Gail, I've watched you let Jehovah plant you in his organization like a tree.

00:12:22.549 --> 00:12:25.590
He has kept feeding and watering you.

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:31.870
Show your appreciation by remembering the thanking, except whatever assignment is offered

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:38.750
and let his hands guide you as you continue to trust him and share your trading just as

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:42.750
a tree produces good fruitage and its shade refreshes.

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:46.830
Well, I guess that's what he'd like to say to you.

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:47.830
Wow.

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:48.830
Yeah.

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:50.830
That is wonderful advice, though.

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:55.389
I'm sorry, I know you weren't expecting that, Gail Marie, but your grandfather was so happy

00:12:55.389 --> 00:12:57.870
to share those words of advice with you.

00:12:57.870 --> 00:12:59.110
It was lovely.

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:00.110
Maybe one last question.

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:03.950
If you had to sum up with all you've been through in your lives, if you had to maybe

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:07.789
sum up just a key lesson, what would it be?

00:13:07.789 --> 00:13:10.590
I think there's a couple of things that come to mind.

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:15.230
One of the things, again, my mum always told me, especially when I was younger, you don't

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:17.590
always have to be the best.

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:22.269
Just do your best and even going through to school, you know, those words have really helped

00:13:22.269 --> 00:13:27.070
me just to focus on what's most important and also something else that we've learnt

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:31.950
in the school was the example of Jeremiah when he said of Jehovah, oh, Jehovah, you fooled

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:33.269
me.

00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:34.269
And that's what Jehovah does.

00:13:34.269 --> 00:13:35.870
He fooled us at times.

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:38.789
You know, we think that we're not able to accomplish something.

00:13:38.789 --> 00:13:43.110
We think that we're not able to keep going, but we can.

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:47.190
In Jehovah's strength, he fooled us and we are able to succeed.

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:52.429
So I think those two things have been a real stabilising influence on myself.

00:13:52.429 --> 00:13:53.429
Thank you.

00:13:53.429 --> 00:13:54.429
Gail Marie, what would you say?

00:13:54.429 --> 00:14:00.269
I would say, again, going back to what Steve's mum told us before she passed away, that

00:14:00.269 --> 00:14:05.149
if we have the circumstances to do more for Jehovah, if we have the health and we have

00:14:05.149 --> 00:14:07.750
the strength, just try it.

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:11.789
You know, even if it's not your natural thing, you know, you never thought about doing

00:14:11.789 --> 00:14:12.789
it.

00:14:12.789 --> 00:14:16.190
You'll be surprised that when you do try something new, you'll grow to love it.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:20.870
This is that scripture in Psalms 34 says, Taste and See, that Jehovah is good.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:21.870
Thank you very much.

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:24.350
Thank you very much, both, for being with us today on The Insights Story.

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:25.350
Thank you.

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:29.139
Thank you.

00:14:29.139 --> 00:14:48.019
Now, let's welcome our next guests, Gizem and Ergun Chimen from Turkey.

00:14:48.019 --> 00:14:50.220
Brothers and sisters, Chimen, welcome to The Insights Story.

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:52.620
It's nice to have you with us today.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.299
You're both serving at the branch in Turkey, Ergun.

00:14:55.299 --> 00:15:01.059
You're serving in the service department and Gizem in the translation department.

00:15:01.059 --> 00:15:06.059
Today we're looking forward to a special feature on this edition of The Insights Story that

00:15:06.059 --> 00:15:07.860
you've brought with you.

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:12.940
And let me ask you this first, though, what do you love about serving in Turkey?

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:18.299
It is very exciting because many plays mentioned in the Bible are in Turkey.

00:15:18.299 --> 00:15:20.700
And have you visited many of these places, Ergun?

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:21.700
Yeah.

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:23.419
We visited many of these places.

00:15:23.419 --> 00:15:29.419
And we know some can visit these places, others don't have the opportunity to travel.

00:15:29.419 --> 00:15:32.779
But we would like to show a few places we love.

00:15:32.779 --> 00:15:35.100
Let's take a trip to Asia Minor.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.100
Thank you very much.

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:39.059
We're looking forward to seeing it.

00:15:39.059 --> 00:15:45.100
Did you know that many of the places mentioned in the Bible are located in Turkey?

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:50.659
These lands have played a significant role in the history of God's people.

00:15:50.659 --> 00:15:54.179
And we have been immersed in the Bible lands in class.

00:15:54.179 --> 00:15:57.539
Would you like to visit some of them?

00:15:57.539 --> 00:16:03.740
Luckily, the first place many may think of is Ephesus, located on the west coast of Asia

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:04.740
Minor.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:09.100
This city was considered a crossroad of the ancient world.

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:14.700
When touring, you will see the ruins of a large stadium and theater.

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:20.100
But the most outstanding future of the city was the temple of Artemis, ranked to be one

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:24.620
of the seven wonders of the world by the ancients.

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:33.659
Many well-known Christians walked through here, including Paul, John, Timothy and Mark.

00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:39.259
The Apostle Paul spent a lot of time in this city, preaching and performing miracles.

00:16:39.259 --> 00:16:42.740
As a result, many Ephesians became believers.

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:48.580
While this was pleasing to Jehovah, it angered others and culminated in a city riot at

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:50.860
the theater.

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:57.500
It was also here in Ephesus that Peresila and Aquila met Apollos and helped him gain

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.379
an accurate understanding of the truth.

00:17:00.379 --> 00:17:06.380
And many years later, the Apostle John would riot his three letters and the gospel from

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:07.380
here.

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:13.299
A lot happened in Ephesus, but just a little further to the northwest was another notable

00:17:13.299 --> 00:17:15.980
city mentioned in the Bible.

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:16.980
Pergamon.

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:21.460
As you may recall, this was one of the seven congregations addressed in the letter of

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:23.259
revelation.

00:17:23.259 --> 00:17:30.059
And as we learned, the city was steep not only in religious worship, but also in political

00:17:30.059 --> 00:17:31.059
worship.

00:17:31.059 --> 00:17:37.259
In fact, Pergamon was the first city to have a temple dedicated to a Roman emperor.

00:17:37.259 --> 00:17:44.140
This was a subtle way to unite all the various conquered countries under a common god.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:51.299
While they were free to worship their national gods, all were required to worship the emperor.

00:17:51.299 --> 00:17:56.900
It was for these reasons that the faithful Christians in Pergamon were said to be living

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:59.099
where the throne of Satan is.

00:17:59.099 --> 00:18:05.019
Yet, despite being surrounded by all kinds of worship, the brothers and sisters were praised

00:18:05.019 --> 00:18:07.619
for holding fast to Jesus' name.

00:18:07.619 --> 00:18:11.019
They were a good example for us today.

00:18:11.019 --> 00:18:13.940
Next, we arrived at Sidis.

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:20.500
The manufacturing of woolen clothes and carpets, as well as its fertile agriculture,

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:23.980
have made Sardis an effluent city.

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:29.700
Here too, you will see prominent ruins of a temple dedicated to the goddess Artemis, a Roman

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:32.099
theater and a stadium.

00:18:32.099 --> 00:18:36.500
This was not an easy environment to keep one's eye simple.

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.660
There were many distractions.

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:44.660
By the latter part of the first century CE, the Christian congregation in Sardis was

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:47.819
admonished to wake up spiritually.

00:18:47.819 --> 00:18:54.339
However, Jehovah also took notice that there were some Christians who did not defy their

00:18:54.339 --> 00:18:58.099
altar garments from a spiritual standpoint.

00:18:58.099 --> 00:19:00.660
Jehovah doesn't miss anyone.

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.019
How true.

00:19:03.019 --> 00:19:07.140
Well-given, last on our field trip is the city of Laudicia.

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:11.740
This city enjoyed great prosperity as a banking center.

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:12.740
This is true.

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:15.859
Yet, it had one major disadvantage.

00:19:15.859 --> 00:19:21.059
Unlike its neighboring cities, Laudicia had no permanent water source.

00:19:21.059 --> 00:19:26.980
So, by means of an echo deck and a series of stone blocks that were brought through

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:32.779
the center and cemented together, water was piped in from far away.

00:19:32.779 --> 00:19:38.059
By the time it reached the city, it was usually lukewarm.

00:19:38.059 --> 00:19:43.660
This helps us to understand why it was a fitting metaphor to use when giving counsel to the

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:44.660
congregation.

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:49.220
Though materially rich, they were spiritually poor.

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:55.140
The glorified Jesus Christ encouraged them to be stimulating the hot or refreshingly

00:19:55.140 --> 00:20:00.059
cold, but not to stay lukewarm in their worship to Jehovah.

00:20:00.059 --> 00:20:03.339
But good reminders for all of us.

00:20:03.339 --> 00:20:08.900
These are just a few of the locations in Turkey mentioned in the Bible.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:12.339
There is much more to see and learn.

00:20:12.339 --> 00:20:20.339
We hope you enjoyed this short field trip to Asia Minor.

00:20:20.339 --> 00:20:24.740
Thank you very much Ergun and Gizem, you've really, through that video, brought to life

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:29.619
some of those cities in Turkey that are found in the Bible in Asia Minor.

00:20:29.619 --> 00:20:33.779
Thank you for being with us on this edition of The Insight Story.

00:20:33.779 --> 00:20:38.299
Our experiences today have shown us that love does build up.

00:20:38.299 --> 00:20:43.700
And Jehovah provides people for us, our brothers and sisters, our families who give us the

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:50.059
support we need as we go through life, the kind of support that all of us value receiving,

00:20:50.059 --> 00:20:54.819
but also the kind of support that we ourselves can give others.

00:20:54.819 --> 00:21:00.460
Hebrews 12-12 encourages us to strengthen the hands that hang down.

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:04.460
It's something that each one of us can do and we never know what it will do for our

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:05.980
brothers and sisters.

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:09.579
We look forward to seeing you again on another edition of The Insight Story.
