00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:06.580
I'd like to invite you to open up your Bible with me, please, to 2 Timothy chapter 4, as

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.339
we'll read verses 7 and 8, which gives us a little context around our day text.

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:20.219
As you may recall, at the time Paul was writing to Timothy in 65, around the year 65 CE,

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:26.100
Paul was in a Roman prison, he was in chains, and he was facing an imminent death.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.539
The question we could ask was Paul enduring his trials successfully.

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:37.340
Well, let's read together 2 Timothy chapter 4 beginning in verse 7.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.840
Paul says,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:46.539
I have fought the fine fight, I have run the race to the finish, I have observed the faith.

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:51.939
From this time on, there is reserve for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord,

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:58.340
the righteous judge, will give me as a reward in that day, yet not to me only, but also

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.420
to all those who have loved his manifestation.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.579
Well, what a courageous positive outlook for a man who knew he was about to die.

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:18.299
Paul was convinced that his endurance in Jehovah's service had well been worth the effort.

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.859
He knew the truthfulness of what Jesus had earlier said at Matthew chapter 24 and verse

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:28.620
13, that the one who has endured to the end, whether it be the end of his life or the

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.579
end of the system of things, will be saved.

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:38.260
Well like Paul, each of us has a race, we need to finish.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.540
So we might ask the question, how are we doing?

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.420
Well, all of us are running, we're closer to the finish line than when we started.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.659
It's great news, but are we getting tired?

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:58.140
Tired of this pandemic, tired of bad news, tired of seeing our friends and family members

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.900
suffer in various ways as this wicked system of things comes to a close.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.259
This morning to strengthen us, to not give up or give out, I thought it would be good

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.379
for us to first consider the meaning of scriptural endurance, and then we'll discuss a

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:21.060
comforting assurance from our God of loyal love, Jehovah.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.219
First, in the scriptures, what is endurance?

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:34.659
Well the Greek noun denotes courageous, steadfast, or patient endurance that does not lose

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:40.819
hope in the face of obstacles, persecutions, trials, or temptations.

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.900
It's a beautiful quality.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:50.060
The related verb often has the sense of remaining instead of fleeing, standing one's ground

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:57.300
persevering, organized to do Jehovah's will in chapter 17 gives a beautiful description

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.659
of this quality.

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:04.460
You may wish to read it later, but it pointedly states this in one sentence, without endurance,

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.580
we cannot stay in the truth.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.180
Well, why is endurance, this beautiful, precious quality that we need to continue cultivating,

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.699
so important for all of us, regardless of how many years we've been running in the

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:20.699
race?

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:23.860
Well, think of an illustration.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.460
Think of literal runners in a marathon.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.379
At the start, all of the runners worked hard to qualify.

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.060
That's excellent.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:41.340
So what happens to a runner who gives up anywhere before crossing the finish line?

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:48.099
Is he any better than a person who gave up much earlier in the race, or a person who didn't

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.099
even try to join the race?

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:52.699
No.

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:58.099
The results for tiring out or giving up are the same, disqualification.

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.580
We would lose out on the reward.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.860
Well, what's the point?

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.960
All of us, regardless of how long we've been running, regardless of how tired we may

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:16.699
be right now, need to be determined to run to the finish, which Jehovah's help.

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:22.139
You know, this thought reminded me of a comment that I heard from brother Mancoca.

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.759
If you've read the Theocratic history of Angola in the yearbook, then you've read about

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:29.560
brother Zhao Mancoca.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:36.560
His faithfulness during periods of intense persecution is something we all wish to imitate.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.480
Brother Mancoca is still alive.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.360
He's 95 years of age.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:47.319
He's a faithful and energetic brother supporting the Branch Committee there in Angola.

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:53.079
Several years ago, we had the privilege of meeting him when he was 88 years of age.

00:04:53.079 --> 00:04:57.160
I was giving him an encouraging visit, but it turned out to be much more encouraging

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.160
for me.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.480
I'm sure than it was for him.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.639
In discussing his past faithfulness, it was interesting his comment.

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:05.360
He said this.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.360
He says, it's not what I was that matters.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.519
It's who I am that matters.

00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:19.879
Yes, brother Mancoca, you dear elderly brothers and sisters who are in the race and who have

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:22.000
been in the race.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.160
You understand endurance.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.879
You know that it means striving, forward, moving forward, maintaining a strong hope, a

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:35.199
positive view, no matter how many the trials are how difficult they are.

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:39.519
Well, that's our goal, isn't it, all of us, to endure to the end.

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:45.680
I invite you now to open up your Bible with me to 1 Corinthians 10-13.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.120
Here we find a very comforting assurance, we've read it before.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.120
But as we discuss it and analyze it for just a few moments, I'd like you to think about

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:00.759
it, not only for yourself, but think about someone in your family or in your congregation

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:04.439
who would benefit by having this reminder shared with them.

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:09.879
And perhaps during the weeks to come, we can think about others that need the encouragement

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:11.720
that this scripture provides.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.800
1 Corinthians 10-13, it reads,

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:25.040
No temptation has come upon you except what is common to men, but God is faithful.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:30.519
And He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear, but along with the temptation,

00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:35.839
He will also make the way out so that you may be able to endure it.

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:41.680
Well, how would you summarize the assurance given in God's inspired word?

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.199
It's this.

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:50.079
No matter what trials may yet arise in our life before we get the finish line, Jehovah

00:06:50.079 --> 00:06:54.680
will sustain us if we trust in Him.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:00.560
We might notice in the reading two fundamental truths that serve as the foundation for this

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.560
comfort.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.920
First, did you notice in the beginning part of verse 13, it says,

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:09.079
The trials we face are common to men?

00:07:09.079 --> 00:07:10.839
What does that mean?

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:17.399
That means that anything we're going through now, stresses, anxieties, difficulties,

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:21.040
are common to the human experience.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:27.360
As a result, they're not beyond our capacity to bear up as long as we rely on Jehovah

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.079
God.

00:07:29.079 --> 00:07:35.040
In the context of these words, in 1 Corinthians 10, particularly in verses 6 to 11, we note

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:40.199
that Paul refers to the tests that the Israelites faced in the wilderness.

00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:42.879
You know, think of the tests they faced.

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:50.240
None of those trials, while walking in a wilderness for 40 years, were beyond human experience,

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:56.519
or in other words, beyond the ability of faithful Israelites to bear up under.

00:07:56.519 --> 00:08:01.160
Interestingly, Paul says four times that some of them disobeyed.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:06.360
Yes, sadly, some Israelites gave in to wrong desires.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:13.079
Not because their trials were just too much for their weak human souls to bear, nor was

00:08:13.079 --> 00:08:15.240
it because Jehovah had failed them.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:21.160
No, it was because some of them failed to rely on God.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.480
What's the second fundamental truth in this verse?

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.319
Well we read that God is faithful.

00:08:27.319 --> 00:08:29.279
Well we know that to be true, don't we?

00:08:29.279 --> 00:08:35.279
Our experience with Jehovah has proven him to be faithful in supporting us in all previous

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:37.879
tests we've faced.

00:08:37.879 --> 00:08:42.720
Indeed the record of God's dealings with his people demonstrates that he's abundant

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:51.679
in loyal love as we discussed last evening, abundant in loyal love to those who obey him.

00:08:51.679 --> 00:08:57.120
Like Joshua, we look back at the record that we've experienced with Jehovah, the record

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:03.480
his people since the time of Israel have experienced with Jehovah, and what do we know?

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:09.639
We know with all our heart, with all our soul, that not one word out of all the good promises

00:09:09.639 --> 00:09:13.600
that Jehovah has made has failed.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.120
What's that mean?

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:22.200
Jehovah will be faithful to us today, tomorrow as we face tests and temptations.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.360
So two points we can take away.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:29.759
Jehovah will not allow any trial to develop to a point where it would make it impossible

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:35.840
for us to bear, and second, he will make the way out for us.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:43.600
Yes, Jehovah, in various ways can either remove trials or help us to endure trials, with

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:50.120
joy, with hope, with determination so that all of us can with his help cross that finish

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.120
line.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:58.840
Well, these thoughts today move us to run with endurance another day in Jehovah's service,

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:03.799
and may we be determined to help others to do the same as we encourage and upbuild one

00:10:03.799 --> 00:10:04.279
another.
