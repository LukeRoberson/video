I think you can get into the trap of just in the same presentation all the time every weekend

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:16.940
and that can get boring, especially if you don't get a good response from it.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.539
One of the most important things for me in learning to enjoy the ministry was to do different types of ministry

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:28.539
learning that it's not just about first school, it's also about return visits, street work, business territory

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:33.939
and the more different types of ministry that you can do, the more you really realise how varied and enjoyable it is.

00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:39.539
And that's what helped me to enjoy the ministry more, was trying different forms of ministry, business territory, street work

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.539
and it keeps your mind focused on what you're doing.

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:49.000
I find that if I take my magazines on my way to work on the train and read them,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
they'll always have somebody looking over my shoulder and even precisely the other day I'm trying to learn Portuguese

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.799
and I had to learn to read and write for a short in Portuguese and there was one lady that was sitting next to me

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:05.799
and this other sister that I read the train with and she just kind of glanced over.

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:11.000
She's like, oh, what's that? You're trying to learn Portuguese and she wanted more information

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
while we ended up witnessing to her.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.140
I've been stopping in businesses like small corner stores where they sell the newspaper and things

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.140
and there's a lot of people, Asian backgrounds there, bring them literature and their language

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.140
and they get used to seeing me come around regularly and they're more open there.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.409
When I was a teenager we had a lot of outside buildings and when it's really cold

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.409
and it's snowing and rain and you take advantage of the subways and if you go down there

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:44.409
this witness is all over but people know us and we place literally hundreds of magazines down there

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.409
and people take them on the way to work.

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.409
If we leave ourselves open to preach to someone and every opportunity possible, you'll have great experiences.
