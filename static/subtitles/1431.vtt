WEBVTT

00:00:22.219 --> 00:00:24.940
We came to support the preaching campaign in Bolivia.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.019
We live far away from here. We come from Brazil.

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.019
Do you want to know why we came here?

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.619
This is my dad, my mom, and me.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.020
Me and my wife tried to encourage Olivia to have spiritual goals.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.439
Many other brothers also came like Enrique and Cynthia

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:48.640
that had been in Bethel for almost 10 years.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.640
What motivated me to come to the campaign

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.240
was the opportunity to enhance my preaching skills

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.659
and the quality of my ministry.

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:02.060
My name is Taina, I'm 22 years old.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.459
I really want to be a pioneer to be in full-time service.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:09.060
But because of my circumstances, I haven't been able to start yet.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.459
But I wanted to be here because I knew that for these 10 days,

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:16.459
I'd be living the life of full-time service.

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:18.659
Acts 16-9 says,

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.659
Step over into Macedonia and help us.

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.859
That really applies to Bolivia.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.060
In this case, it's step over into Bolivia and help us.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.060
It's a very productive ministry

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:36.730
with people who need Jehovah and who are willing to learn about him.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.530
As I'm a very anxious and insecure person,

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.530
I really, really wanted to come,

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.930
but there was a point that I got really anxious about how it would be here.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.730
And there was that insecurity about being in another place

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.730
with a different language.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.730
No, we didn't have much money at all.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.730
We had to make some adjustments.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.329
We had to plan our budget very carefully.

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:01.930
My mum was going to have surgery,

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.730
and it was going to be on the day that we were coming here.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.729
We prayed to Jehovah, left the matter in his hands.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.729
We decided to trust in him.

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:19.419
And in the end, Mum's surgery was postponed.

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:25.379
We had the opportunity to meet many brothers and sisters.

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:30.379
Every day, someone invited us to come to have some coffee, lunch.

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:32.780
Some don't have much, but the little they have,

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:39.270
they offer us such love and it's so good to feel this.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.270
Jehovah is so good as Psalm 34 verse 8 says.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:50.719
Jehovah has given us the privilege of being used by him to contact these people.

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:53.919
The campaign helped me to improve my preaching skills.

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:59.219
With Jehovah's help, I had some great conversations.

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:03.219
This campaign has been good for us in so many ways.

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:12.699
New culture, new friends, feeling the warmth, the love of all the brothers.

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:16.099
The campaign has had a real impact on our daughter.

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:21.099
During our conversations, we can see that her desire to set spiritual goals has increased.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.069
I want to stay more here in Bolivia.

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.870
If I could, I'd stay here much longer,

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:45.030
because ten days was really short, too short.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.830
The campaign is motivating me a lot to start full-time service,

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.509
to continue pursuing my goals.

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:55.710
It's helped me to develop some qualities,

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.509
such as controlling more my anxiety, my insecurities,

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:03.789
and trusting more in Jehovah.

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:07.789
When I look back on this campaign, I know I'm going to miss it a lot.

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:12.840
The feeling of being a mini missionary for ten days.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.040
We are taking to Brazil a wonderful experience.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.439
Beyond what we imagine when we took the decision to come here.

00:04:24.079 --> 00:04:28.680
I would like to tell my parents that I'm very grateful for being able to come here.
