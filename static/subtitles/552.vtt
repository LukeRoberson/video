00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.940
What do you think makes us valuable to Jehovah?

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:08.640
Is it our natural ability?

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:12.480
Our many years of faithful service?

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:15.939
Is it our Bethel assignment?

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.559
Well, turn with me and your Bible's to 1 Peter chapter 3, and we'll let

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:26.140
Jehovah answer this through his word for us.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:36.659
1 Peter chapter 3, and we'll reverse 4, but let it be the secret

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:42.060
person of the heart in the incorruptible adornment of the quiet and

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.740
mild spirit, which is of great value in the eyes of God.

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:52.380
Of course, we know in the full context of the opening verses here in

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.859
1 Peter chapter 3, Peter is referring to Christian women.

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:03.859
But if we isolate this phrase in verse 4, the secret person of the heart,

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:09.859
that applies to all of us, brothers and sisters, because it's referring to

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:16.859
who we are on the inside, our thoughts, our beliefs, our emotions.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.659
That's why David prayed in Psalm 51 verse 10 for Jehovah to create within

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:29.980
him a pure heart, because that's what Jehovah sees and examines.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.939
That is what is valuable to him.

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.420
And that's what all of us are striving to do to serve him in that way.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.579
And the beautiful thing is that when Jehovah sees that we're trying to

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:48.219
serve him this way, not only does that make us valuable to him,

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:56.540
but he will also give us whatever we need in whatever assignment we happen to have.

00:01:58.019 --> 00:02:03.299
Now, just to prove this, let's look at three different occasions in various stages

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.340
of David's life, all related to his assignment in warfare.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:16.909
We'll start with the account in 1 Samuel chapter 17, when it was determined

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.909
that David was going to fight Goliath, you recall that he was clothed with Saul's

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:29.030
armor. Now, luckily, that was quite the privilege to fight with the King's armor.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.310
But notice the middle of verse 39, after David tries it on, look at what happens.

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:42.629
David said to Saul, I am unable to go in these things before I am not used to them.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.270
So David took them off.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:53.270
So valuable armor, but David wasn't equipped to use it.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.270
It didn't fit him or his circumstances at the time.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.270
But you notice David didn't let that stop him.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.270
Instead, he used what worked for him.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:12.270
He looked for five smooth stones and with Jehovah's help, that was more than enough

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.270
for him to carry out his assignment.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:22.270
Perhaps we know of brothers and sisters, maybe here at Bethel or in the field,

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:30.270
who at one time may have been hesitant in having a Bible study or engaging in some other aspect of the ministry,

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.270
maybe because they felt they didn't have the skill of a seasoned pioneer.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.270
And yet, they excelled and Jehovah blessed their efforts.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.270
You see, they didn't let that stop them.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.270
They just worked with what they had.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:52.270
Their love for Jehovah, their sincerity, and Jehovah blessed them.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:04:00.270
The point is, due to our circumstances, we may not all have the experience, the training,

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:06.270
the figurative King's armor, so to speak, for a particular assignment.

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:11.270
But we still should not let that stop us in our efforts to serve Jehovah.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.270
We find what works for us.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:22.269
And it may be that for time, we may feel that we're just working with a couple of figurative smooth stones.

00:04:22.269 --> 00:04:29.269
But Jehovah says that is more than enough for us to carry out our assignment.

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:32.269
Well, let's consider the second occasion.

00:04:32.269 --> 00:04:37.269
Some time later now, David is trained, he's skilled, he's quite the warrior.

00:04:37.269 --> 00:04:47.269
And in 1 Samuel 18 verse 4, he gets another privilege, this time, to use the armor of Saul's son, Jonathan.

00:04:47.269 --> 00:04:49.269
And he's successful.

00:04:49.269 --> 00:04:51.269
He wins many battles.

00:04:51.269 --> 00:04:56.269
To the point where in verse 7, the women are celebrating.

00:04:56.269 --> 00:05:01.269
Saul has struck down his thousands, and David, his tens of thousands.

00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:05.269
Well, what makes David so successful?

00:05:05.269 --> 00:05:11.269
When watched our noted that David's fighting was a matter of courage,

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:17.269
because he repeatedly inquired of Jehovah as to his moving into battle,

00:05:17.269 --> 00:05:25.269
showing that he was being guided by Jehovah and not merely love of conquest.

00:05:25.269 --> 00:05:28.269
What can we take away from this?

00:05:28.269 --> 00:05:33.269
Even if we're privileged to do many things in the organization,

00:05:33.269 --> 00:05:44.269
we should never let our intellect, our privilege, our position, our natural abilities stop us from seeking Jehovah's direction first.

00:05:44.269 --> 00:05:50.269
That can help us to maintain humility, to keep us valuable to Jehovah.

00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:52.269
Thought it was interesting.

00:05:52.269 --> 00:05:58.269
The watchtower also mentioned one of the reasons that the women were able to sing and celebrate David

00:05:58.269 --> 00:06:03.269
was because of how David inspired his men in battle.

00:06:03.269 --> 00:06:08.269
So clearly, David must have worked along well with others.

00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:14.269
He encouraged his men, he motivated them, he brought out the best in them.

00:06:14.269 --> 00:06:22.269
And together, they were able to have many victories in behalf of Jehovah.

00:06:22.269 --> 00:06:27.269
Well, isn't that a nice reminder for family heads, congregation elders,

00:06:27.269 --> 00:06:30.269
our overseers and crew leaders here at Bethel?

00:06:30.269 --> 00:06:33.269
When we maintain the right disposition,

00:06:33.269 --> 00:06:40.269
Jehovah can use us to inspire, to motivate and encourage those that we work with.

00:06:41.269 --> 00:06:48.269
And then together, we can accomplish much to Jehovah's praise.

00:06:48.269 --> 00:06:54.269
One final occasion, this time in 2 Samuel.

00:06:54.269 --> 00:07:00.269
At this point, David is now older, he's won many battles.

00:07:00.269 --> 00:07:05.269
But in yet another war with the Palestinians, notice what happens to him.

00:07:06.269 --> 00:07:18.990
Second Samuel chapter 21 will read verse 15.

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:22.990
It says so once again, there was a war between the Philistines and Israel.

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:26.990
So David and his servants went down and fought the Philistines.

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:32.589
But David became exhausted.

00:07:32.589 --> 00:07:40.589
This time, David, even with his armor, was in a situation that almost got him killed.

00:07:40.589 --> 00:07:45.589
Now, the courage was still there, but his strength wasn't.

00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:48.589
He was exhausted.

00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:57.589
So in verse 17, how grateful he must have been that men like Abishai had kept an eye on him

00:07:57.589 --> 00:08:00.589
and quickly came to his aid.

00:08:00.589 --> 00:08:06.589
If you go back a couple of chapters to chapter 18, in verses 3 and 4,

00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:10.589
this matter of David going out to fight had come up before.

00:08:10.589 --> 00:08:18.589
But you notice when you look at those verses, it was not as if the men were stopping David from doing anything.

00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:23.589
They just wanted him to do work that fit his circumstances.

00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:28.589
And in verse 4, we see the wisdom of David in agreeing to do so.

00:08:28.589 --> 00:08:36.970
What doesn't this make us think of our dear, faithful older ones in the family?

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:41.970
We love all of you so dearly, we hold you in high esteem.

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:49.970
And we know that Jehovah treasures and values you as well, because he sees your heart.

00:08:49.970 --> 00:09:00.970
And he knows that your strength may not be as it once was, but your faith, your love, your courage, your zeal.

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:05.970
It's all there, and it's the strongest ever.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:12.970
So we're so appreciative of our brotherhood, this Bethel family, where we have members like Abishai,

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:20.970
where it's such a privilege for them and us to come to your aid and support when we can.

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:30.970
And Jehovah certainly appreciates your willingness to do whatever work you're able to do as it fits your circumstances.

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:38.970
So what a reminder it is to know that it's not our strength or natural ability that draws us closer to Jehovah.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:46.970
It's that secret person of the heart, a pure heart that makes us valuable to God.

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:54.970
And when we serve him in that way, he will give us whatever we need, regardless of our situation or circumstances,

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:59.970
to always serve him in a way that he approves.
