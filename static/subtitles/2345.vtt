00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.320
The Apostle Paul presented information that was informative to his audience.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.320
For instance, what he said to Jews in Jerusalem,

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.320
differed from what he said to Greeks and Athens.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.320
He wrote, as recorded at 1 Corinthians 9,

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.320
to the Jews, I became as a Jew in order to gain Jews.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.320
To those without law, I became as without law.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.320
I have become all things to people of all sorts.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.320
So that I might by all possible means save some.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.320
But I do all things for the sake of the good news.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.320
How can we make our teaching informative to our audience?

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.320
First, we should consider what our listeners already know.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.320
For example, if we're speaking to a congregation of mature Christians,

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.319
we shouldn't simply repeat basic Bible truths that they've heard before.

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:14.319
Instead, we can help them to look at the topic from a fresh perspective.

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:16.319
Watch the following example.

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:20.319
Is the presentation informative to the audience?

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:28.319
At John chapter 13 verse 35, Jesus explained how to identify His followers.

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:32.319
He said, by this all will know that you are My disciples

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:36.319
if you have love among yourselves.

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:41.319
That expression among yourselves shows that all true Christians

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:45.319
would be together in one group or organization.

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:51.319
And this organization would be identified by the love its members have for one another.

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:55.319
Isn't it common during war for people of the same religion

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:00.319
but who live in the opposing countries to slaughter one another?

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:05.319
Is there any religion in which people truly view fellow worshipers

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:10.319
from another neighborhood, city or country as their brother?

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.319
Was that informative?

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.319
If the speaker was talking to unbelieving relatives or workmates,

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.319
then yes, it was informative.

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.319
But let's say that he was giving a talk to mature Christians.

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.319
If he spent a lot of time presenting basic information that the audience already knew,

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.319
he might quickly lose their attention.

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.319
How could he discuss the same scripture, John 1335,

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:44.319
in a way that would be informative to an audience of fellow believers?

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:50.319
Here, Jesus said that love would identify His true disciples.

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:56.319
Did you notice the setting for Jesus' discussion recorded here at John chapter 13?

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.319
Jesus had just instituted the Lord's evening meal.

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:05.319
He knew that He had very little time left before His arrest and execution.

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:10.319
The matter of His own integrity was weighing heavily on His mind.

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.319
But it was so important to Jesus that His disciples loved one another,

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.319
that He included it in His parting words to them.

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.319
At the time, they didn't know it, but the one another would come to include

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.319
not just fellow Jews but Samaritans and Gentiles too.

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:34.569
What were some obstacles in the first century that Christians needed to overcome?

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.569
How can their example help us?

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.569
Even though the speaker was discussing a well-known truth,

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.569
he made it informative to his audience by including some historical context

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.569
that his listeners may not have known or remembered,

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.569
he chose a fresh perspective.

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.569
When preparing to teach well-known Bible truths,

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.569
how can we come up with a fresh perspective?

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.569
Think about the subject and do research.

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.569
As we prepare, we can ask questions such as,

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:16.569
who, what, when, where, why, and how.

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:21.569
And then we can answer some of those questions in our presentation.

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:26.569
Perhaps we could include less familiar facts or current events.

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:31.569
However, it's not enough simply to present interesting information

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:34.569
that may not be well known by your listeners.

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:40.569
We must also explain how the information can help them in their daily life.

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:43.569
That requires being specific.

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:46.569
Perhaps we can consider some realistic situations

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:49.569
and then outline how to apply the information.

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:52.569
Let's watch a publisher doing this on a Bible study

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:55.569
when discussing with his student the picture and caption

00:04:55.569 --> 00:05:00.569
on page 219 of the Remain in God's Love Book.

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:03.569
Look at the illustration on page 219.

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:05.569
What does a caption say?

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:08.569
Reliant Jehovah when you are sick.

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:11.569
Yes, rely on Jehovah.

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:13.569
What's that mean?

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:17.569
Let's say you were diagnosed with a serious illness.

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:20.569
How could you rely on Jehovah?

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:25.569
Well, the book mentions that some treatments involve spiritism.

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:29.569
Even if I was desperate, I wouldn't choose them because they're wrong.

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:31.569
Good.

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:35.569
What are some other ways to rely on Jehovah when we're sick?

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:37.569
Prayer.

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:39.569
Yeah, that's very important.

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:42.569
How would that help you if you were sick?

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:46.569
The teacher took a general statement.

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:50.569
Reliant Jehovah when you are sick and helped a student to see

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:53.569
how it relates to him personally.

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:57.569
If we present information that is informative to our audience,

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:02.569
we'll stimulate their thinking and teach them something worthwhile.
