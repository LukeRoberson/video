00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:06.769
Yes, two friends who share our love for Jehovah are invaluable.

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:10.609
We'll see that in this story from Japan.

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:18.449
Sisters Takaku Sato and his Saku Wakui have worked together as pioneers since 1957.

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.690
Let's learn how their friendship has helped them serve Jehovah with joy.

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:28.010
We are pioneer partners.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.250
We've been working together for over 60 years.

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:39.770
In 1956, I was the only Jehovah's Witness in Nagano Prefecture.

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:44.890
It was Lonsum, but I applied for regular pioneer service.

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:50.570
Surprisingly, I was appointed as a special pioneer.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:01:00.329
I was so happy that I found myself rolling around on the tatami mat floor with the appointment letter in my hand.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.010
That was the way I expressed my joy and appreciation.

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:12.250
When I was invited to serve as a special pioneer, I was sent to Nagano, and that's where I met Hisako.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.650
Takako and I focused on our ministry.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:26.140
When an isolated group was established, since there were no brothers, I would wear a head covering

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.500
and conduct a meeting.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.939
Sometimes the outlines were in English.

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:33.739
We didn't understand anything.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.939
But people were delighted to hear even just the scriptures and went home satisfied,

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.659
and that strongly impressed me the power of God's word.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.599
We were assigned to a territory in the city after that.

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.200
We found so many Notre Thames.

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:00.599
But we determined to meet people.

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:06.680
So we changed the times we preached and talked to people on the street who were going to work.

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:10.599
We cherished even small opportunities.

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:17.240
When we had a chance to meet a householder, we always tried to have a conversation

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.639
that we could link to the next visit.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.800
Before long, I had 10 Bible studies.

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:32.150
Takako acts like she is cheerful, but she's been fighting with various illnesses.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.830
At times, it was so bad that I could not even go out in service.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.430
I had a serious skin condition.

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:49.909
I could not bear to look at the illustration of Job in the magazine,

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.389
and I covered it up with paper.

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:59.210
But Jehovah helped me to look to Job's example.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:07.379
I learned that our endurance under trial would become praise to God.

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.939
I have often had health problems.

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:18.389
Just at one of those times, I received a letter from the branch.

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.349
It said,

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:24.389
what you can accomplish now may be limited.

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:31.830
However, think about all that you have done up to now to give praise to Jehovah.

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:36.150
About the people you were able to help learn the truth,

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.389
and be joyful,

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:41.990
knowing that you have been used by Jehovah fully.

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:50.490
I couldn't stop crying because I really felt the care and concern

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.050
from the organization and from Jehovah.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.229
Hisako also took real good care of me and prayed with me.

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:05.939
Our thinking and personality are different,

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:09.939
but we made efforts to talk things out.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:17.459
Our heartfelt desire to want to serve Jehovah full-time has always been the same.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:26.379
For 60 years, we've enjoyed a truly wonderful life of service to Jehovah.

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:31.660
Jehovah has supported us in difficult times through the Bible,

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.579
the organization and friends.

00:04:35.019 --> 00:04:37.500
I have tasted the truthfulness of the words,

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.420
when I am weak, then I am powerful.

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:47.300
When I said, my foot is slipping,

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.779
your kindness so Jehovah has supported me.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.579
I can say that too.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.220
Although we don't have energy and no ability,

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.459
we've been able to enjoy full-time service together up to now.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.980
I'm really content now. It's all thanks to Jehovah.

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:17.399
Like the Apostle Paul, our sisters cultivated singleness

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:22.920
and focused on full-time service to Jehovah for more than 60 years.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.600
Yes, they face everyday challenges,

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.839
and the extra ones that come with age,

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.079
but their heartfelt desire to serve Jehovah whole soul

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:44.839
brings Takaku and Hisaku real joy and contentment.
