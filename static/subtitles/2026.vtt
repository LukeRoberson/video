00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:06.190
and introduction to second chronicles.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.189
First and second chronicles were originally one volume,

00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:13.189
which was later divided into two.

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:18.190
The writer was Ezra, an Aaronic priest and copyist,

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:23.190
who completed the volume about 460 BCE.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.190
The writing deals almost entirely with the Kingdom of Judah.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.189
Second Chronicles covers a period of 500 years,

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.189
from the start of Solomon's reign in 1037 BCE,

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:41.189
to Persian King Cyrus decree of 537 BCE

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:48.329
to rebuild the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem.

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.329
Chapters 1-9 discuss the reign of King Solomon.

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.329
In chapter 1, Jehovah gives Solomon extraordinary wisdom

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.329
so that he can judge the people well.

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.329
Chapters 2-7 cover Solomon's preparations for the temple,

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:12.329
its utensils and furnishings, as well as its construction and inauguration.

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:16.329
In chapter 9, the queen of Shiba visits Solomon

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:19.329
and is amazed at his wisdom.

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:25.329
After Solomon's 40-year reign, his son Rehoboam becomes king.

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:30.329
In the next chapter, 10 tribes revolt against Rehoboam

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.329
and form the Northern Kingdom of Israel.

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:37.329
Chapters 17-20 discuss King Jehoshaphat,

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:40.329
who does what is right in Jehovah's eyes.

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:45.329
He even sends out princes and Levites to teach God's law.

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.329
In chapter 20, Jehoshaphat prays for help

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:53.329
when facing the combined forces of Ammon, Moab,

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.329
and the mountainous region of Seer.

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.329
In answer to the King's prayer, God causes the invaders

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.329
to slaughter each other.

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.330
In chapter 22, wicked queen Athalia destroys the royal line

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.330
of the house of Judah except for the child Jehoash.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.330
He is saved by Jeho Shabbiaith and her husband, High Priest Jehoyeda.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.330
In chapters 23 and 24, Jehoash is made king at age 7

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.330
and Athalia is put to death.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.330
Under the good influence of High Priest Jehoyeda,

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.330
Jehoash does what is right in God's eyes,

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.330
even renovating the temple.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.330
But after Jehoyeda dies, Jehoash abandons true worship.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:49.330
When Jehoyeda's son rebukes the king, Jehoash has him put to death.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.330
In chapter 26, Uzziah becomes king.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.330
At first, he does what is right in God's eyes.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.330
But later, he becomes haughty.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.330
He even tries to burn incense in the temple,

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.330
a responsibility reserved for the priests.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.330
Jehoba strikes Uzziah with leprosy.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.330
Chapters 29-32 discuss the reign of King Hezekiah

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.330
who zealously promotes true worship all his life.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.330
During Hezekiah's reign,

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.330
Assyrian king Sinakarib invades Judah and threatens Jerusalem.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:34.330
But Jehova's angel wipes out every mighty warrior, leader and chief in the Assyrian camp.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.330
Chapter 33 discusses the 55-year reign of King Manasseh

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.330
who does on a grand scale what is bad in Jehova's eyes.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.949
Did you know?

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:50.949
Although King Manasseh later repented,

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:55.949
his depravity sent Judah into the moral and spiritual tailspin

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:57.949
that led to its exile.

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:04.740
Chapters 34 and 35 discuss the reign of King Josiah.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.740
Eight years old when he becomes king,

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.740
he remains firm for true worship.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:17.500
He even embarks on a sweeping campaign against idolatry.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.500
Chapter 36 discusses the last four kings of Judah.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.500
Jehoah has, Jehoye Kim, Jehoye Kim and Zedekiah,

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.500
all disobey Jehova.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.500
Despite the earlier efforts of the good kings,

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.500
Judah continues to decline into apostasy,

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.500
so Jehova allows the Babylonians to invade the land and attack Jerusalem.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.500
They destroy the city and take the people into exile.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.500
Ezra concludes Second Chronicles by leaping ahead 70 years

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.500
to the reign of Persian king Cyrus.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.500
In a historic decree, Cyrus frees the Jews,

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.500
telling them to rebuild the house of Jehova in Jerusalem.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.170
As you read Second Chronicles,

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:12.170
learn from the examples of the kings, good and bad.

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.170
See how Jehova blessed those who loved him,

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.170
and note how he preserved the royal line of David,

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:24.170
which later produced the Messiah, the King of God's Kingdom.
