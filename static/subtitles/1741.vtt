00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:05.429
Millions of our brothers and sisters around the world can recount the blessings they've

00:00:05.429 --> 00:00:10.189
gained by remaining loyal to Jehovah and his organization.

00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:14.310
And we're privileged to have two such examples here with us today.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.809
Brother and sister William and Sandra Melonfont, brother Melonfont is a helper to the teaching

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:23.550
committee and sister Melonfont's current assignment is in the service department.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.989
And we're looking forward to hearing about their rich spiritual history.

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:32.509
Bill and Sandra were so happy that we could have you here in the studio with us and we

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.509
do look forward to learning more about you.

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:37.030
Maybe we'll have to go back.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.109
How did you get on the road that has led you to such many years of faithful loyal service

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:43.109
to Jehovah?

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:45.829
It was back in 1954.

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.390
My mother had contact on and off with the witnesses for years.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.950
I was about 20 years old and she was invited to a public talk at the Oakland Central

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.829
congregation in California and she asked me, would you accompany me?

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.030
And I said, yeah, sure, I'll be happy to go.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.670
Well, I recognized a young man I knew from high school at the meeting and he approached

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.109
me after and told me I needed a Bible study.

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:15.790
I really didn't want a Bible study but he insisted and so I said, well, you can come by.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:16.790
Would you believe it?

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.150
I started a Bible study in the Let God be true book.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.950
Four months later I was baptized.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.870
It was exactly what I was looking for and I didn't realize it.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:27.870
Excellent.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.870
Now, I understand that you were also very involved with sports.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:38.709
Yes, I was playing ball for a basketball team in Alameda and I enjoyed very much playing

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:44.230
ball but then a decision came up as to what I was going to do because the evenings when

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.469
the team played was the same time that we had the service meeting under theocratic ministry

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:50.469
school.

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:55.950
Like a decision and my decision was forget the sports and let's go to the meetings and

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.909
enjoy being built up spiritually.

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:58.909
Good choice.

00:01:58.909 --> 00:01:59.909
Thank you.

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.909
Sandra, your start on the road to a career serving Jehovah.

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.270
I suppose you could say that it actually started before I was born.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.590
Before I was born, my parents started on this search for the truth.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.949
It happened because they had lost a little girl in death and they went from church to

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:19.870
church looking for some kind of comfort.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.069
And of course, the clergy had no comfort for them.

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:28.069
They just said, well, God wanted another angel in heaven and that angered my father.

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.389
He thought, no, if God wants another angel, he can make one.

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:33.629
He wouldn't take my little girl.

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:39.629
So it just happened that one evening they were listening to the radio long before TV,

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:40.870
of course.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.669
And they heard a Jehovah's Witness give a talk and then the title of that talk was Where

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:47.990
Aren't They Dead?

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.990
Imagine.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.349
He gave all the scripture proof about the condition of the dead, the hope for the resurrection.

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.509
And my father immediately said, this is the truth.

00:02:58.509 --> 00:03:04.469
So they wrote to the radio station, got a copy of the booklet of the talk.

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:09.710
And then also they started receiving the subscription to the watch tower.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.310
But it wasn't until I was born in three years old that the witnesses finally made contact

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.310
with us.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.310
Interesting.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.069
It was a real cold winter day.

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.909
And even though I was only three years old, I remember this family coming in and they

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:25.509
stayed hours.

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:28.590
I even hid in the closet and went sleep.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.750
But you know, it was just, it was that contact with the visible organization that my family

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.189
needed because they knew much of the truth.

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:39.349
They'd been reading the watch tower for a long time.

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:44.030
So my elder sisters, they got baptized right away and started pioneering.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.909
For my brother and I, we were a lot smaller, of course.

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:52.189
We just went along with our parents and came right into the truth.

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:57.590
In fact, I remember was just a couple of years later that we were all going to go to the

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.069
big convention in 1950 at Yankee Stadium.

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.669
But I knew there was going to be a big baptism there.

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:09.030
But I wanted to go as a baptized Jehovah's Witness.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.990
So my father, everybody made arrangements and my father baptized me in our pond on our

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.029
farm with another young sister.

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:19.470
So that was my beginning.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.350
You know, Ron, there's a point I'd like to recall also.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.470
Sandra was at a special convention back in 1941.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.470
That's true.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.470
Even before that.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.350
That was probably my first, you know, big event, theoretically.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.470
Our family, my brother was four years older than I, along with my parents.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:47.430
So we went to the St. Louis Convention where brother, Rathapur gave his famous talk on

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.430
children.

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:54.589
And they separated the lower level of this place that they rented, the stadium was dedicated

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:59.350
to just the young children, well, from five to 18 years of age.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.589
And it was just fantastic, you know, this man, when you're small, this man would look

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:08.350
so big and huge and he had this great, big voice.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:14.310
And I'll never forget when he looked out on the audience and he said, be whole more than

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.829
15,000 new witnesses to the kingdom.

00:05:17.829 --> 00:05:18.829
So it was very emotional.

00:05:18.829 --> 00:05:20.029
Oh, you still remember it like it?

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:21.029
Oh, yes.

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:22.029
It happened yesterday, right?

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:23.029
How exciting.

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:28.110
So what motivated you to make a choice to get into the full-time service and give your

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.870
life to Jehovah?

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:35.550
Well, what motivated me was when I attended a convention also in 56.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.790
I got baptized in 54.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:42.629
But in 56, I went to a district convention in Albany, California and there was a pioneer

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:46.990
booth because in those days they had a booth set up at the district conventions and various

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.230
brothers and sisters would man the booth and answer your questions about pioneer service.

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.790
So I approached the booth and an older sister there looked at me and said, you're young

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.709
and strong, why aren't you a pioneer?

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.230
Well, I felt, well, yes, why not?

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.910
So I started pioneering in 1956.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.069
That's what motivated me and I was, really, I looked back at that.

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:09.949
It was one of the best decisions I made in my life.

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:10.949
Excellent.

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:11.949
Yeah.

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:15.750
So you have been making wise decisions from your youth, Sandra, how about you?

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.149
Motivating to put in a full-time service.

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:22.029
Well, for a pioneer service, you know, it was like a given.

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:26.509
Young people were just encouraged to pioneer and you knew that when you graduated from high

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:32.230
school, you started out pioneering and most of the young people were doing that.

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.910
You know, after a year or two, maybe they would get married and start a family, but those

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:41.709
years and pioneering, starting out their life that way, gave them a wonderful basis for

00:06:41.709 --> 00:06:44.670
loyal service, the rest of their life.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:51.029
And not only that, I remember that in those days, the traveling overseer would stay in

00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:54.430
the homes of the brothers when he served the congregation.

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:58.350
And we always played host to the circuit overseer and his wife when they came.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:01.350
And from my brother and I, they were role models.

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:05.750
My sisters, as I told you, were out pioneering in another assignment.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:11.550
But for us, these brothers were so full of zeal and they were like heroes to us.

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:16.910
In particular, I remember when I was, I think about 12 years old, this couple came around

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.990
on the circuit, Percy and Ilma Islam.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:24.269
They were also from Australia, and of course, we love their accent, too.

00:07:24.269 --> 00:07:28.709
And they had just graduated from Gilead and they were assigned to Japan.

00:07:28.709 --> 00:07:31.870
But they had to wait a number of months to get their visa.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.430
They served in our congregation.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:39.069
And it was really them that instilled in me the desire to become a missionary.

00:07:39.069 --> 00:07:40.470
Beautiful.

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:42.310
So you were pioneering.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:45.029
How did your paths eventually meet?

00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:51.470
It was at a circuit assembly in Oakland, California, 1956.

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:53.470
Very interesting things took place.

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:56.629
I had the job of dismantling the stage.

00:07:56.629 --> 00:07:58.230
I had not yet met Sandra.

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:03.470
She was out visiting her sister who lived in the same area where I was.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:08.110
And I was carrying this large piece of plywood off the stage and I ran right into Sandra and

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:09.949
knocked her flat.

00:08:09.949 --> 00:08:11.870
Well I took advantage of the opportunity.

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:14.990
I thought, well, that's not the best way to introduce yourself.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:19.470
But I said, by the way, would you like to accompany me to a get-together, some of the

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:22.709
friends are having and she accepted.

00:08:22.709 --> 00:08:24.189
And very good, Bill.

00:08:24.189 --> 00:08:25.189
Well, yes.

00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:26.189
And I followed through on it.

00:08:26.189 --> 00:08:30.949
We had a lot of association and after a number of months, we got married.

00:08:30.949 --> 00:08:34.870
And both of us were pioneering, very happy in our ministry serving Jehovah.

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:37.070
You really swept her off her feet, literally.

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:38.070
I felt for it.

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:39.070
Very good.

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:43.269
So shortly after you were married, I understand you received some direction.

00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:44.269
Yes.

00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:47.190
And the circuit overseer visited our congregation.

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:50.750
We were only married about a month, I think, when he came through.

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:55.590
And he told us that the organization was looking for pioneers who'd be willing to serve

00:08:55.590 --> 00:09:01.470
a special pioneers and go wherever where the need was great in the United States, particularly.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:05.029
So we told them, sure, we'd be delighted to do it.

00:09:05.029 --> 00:09:10.350
And four months after our marriage, we received an assignment as special pioneers to Ducora

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:11.669
Ayua.

00:09:11.669 --> 00:09:17.230
Now that was a very interesting place because there were only eight publishers in the congregation.

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:20.870
But we arrived, started with the meetings there at the Kingdom Hall.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:25.470
And the Kingdom Hall was up above Hunt's Variety Store in downtown Ducora.

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.149
And we lived in a room behind it.

00:09:28.149 --> 00:09:32.830
Well, sometimes, especially during the winter time, because it could be very cold.

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:36.190
There'd be no one at the meeting after all, there were only eight publishers.

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:40.590
But I was insisting that no, I'm going to give my public talk.

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:41.870
Whether anyone's here or not.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:46.309
So I'd tell Sally, you sit there and I give my public talk, a one hour talk.

00:09:46.309 --> 00:09:50.590
And then I'd conduct the watchtower study and have her answer every question.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.830
Well, you know, you're on your own like that.

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:54.590
Not a lot of brothers around.

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:56.669
So you look for encouragement and company.

00:09:56.669 --> 00:10:03.110
And we would travel down to Strawberry Point, Ayua, to where Charles and Shirley Sonnetco

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:06.470
lived in a log cabin, one room log cabin.

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:10.149
And we'd go visit with them in order to have some mutual encouragement.

00:10:10.309 --> 00:10:12.309
And because they were special pioneering also.

00:10:12.309 --> 00:10:14.110
OK, well, you were both special.

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:18.389
Yeah, it's a nice picture of you in that log cabin too, as you were special pioneering.

00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:20.070
So you're busy in that work.

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:22.789
What special invitation did you receive?

00:10:22.789 --> 00:10:29.029
Well, we received the invitation to attend Gillian, the 34th class of Gillian School.

00:10:29.029 --> 00:10:31.110
And that was a wonderful thing.

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:34.909
After two and a half years of pioneering, special pioneering in Ayua,

00:10:34.909 --> 00:10:40.110
our instructors were Albert Schroeder, Maxwell Friend, Bob Porter,

00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:42.110
and Jack Redford.

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:46.710
And we had a delightful time at Gillian, as you can imagine.

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:49.149
And we were assigned to Lebanon.

00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:53.269
But we were unable to enter Lebanon because we couldn't get the visa.

00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:57.789
So then the organization asked us, well, will you take an assignment to Morocco?

00:10:57.789 --> 00:10:59.230
We were ready to go anywhere.

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:04.230
We're pioneering with the Canarcy congregation just waiting to go out into the field.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:10.070
So that's how we took a boat from New York City five days across the Atlantic to Casablanca.

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:11.509
Very nice.

00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:15.629
What was it like to be in the missionary service in Morocco?

00:11:15.629 --> 00:11:17.029
It was very interesting.

00:11:17.029 --> 00:11:18.269
We really enjoyed it.

00:11:18.269 --> 00:11:19.909
But you know, we only spoke English.

00:11:19.909 --> 00:11:22.750
So in Morocco, we had to learn French.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:27.389
And the first month of our missionary service in Morocco was for 30 days.

00:11:27.389 --> 00:11:30.830
You studied the language 11 hours a day.

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:33.350
Well, that could get pretty tiring for 11 hours a day.

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:37.190
So we'd go to the French movies and count that as language time.

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:39.309
And then we were moved to Tangier.

00:11:39.309 --> 00:11:41.590
And there was a Spanish congregation in Tangier.

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:44.669
And so we had to learn the Spanish language too.

00:11:44.669 --> 00:11:50.190
But that was really a rich blessing for the two of us to be exposed to that culture

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:52.590
and to have that privilege of serving there.

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:57.110
But you know, what I really enjoyed, we had a variety of people we preached to.

00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:00.389
We had a very large Jewish population.

00:12:00.389 --> 00:12:02.590
And they were almost all Orthodox.

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:05.470
But you know, they were very forthright.

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:08.549
And they were open and quite curious.

00:12:08.549 --> 00:12:11.429
You know, like they'd come to us sometimes and say,

00:12:11.429 --> 00:12:13.230
well, you're Christian, aren't you?

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:15.990
Why do you accept Jesus as the Messiah?

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:19.389
So we had to get familiar with a lot of scriptures, you know,

00:12:19.389 --> 00:12:23.750
that dealt with the prophecy that Messiah would fulfill in the Hebrew scriptures.

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:25.549
And really, it was a delight.

00:12:25.549 --> 00:12:29.389
Sandra, remember, there were a lot of French people in Morocco

00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:32.190
because it used to be a colony under France.

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:35.470
So that's why the French language was so important.

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:39.389
And then we had Spanish people and many other nationalities there.

00:12:39.389 --> 00:12:43.470
So you had four years of serving in Morocco, faithfully,

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:46.110
loyally meeting all those different languages,

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:47.909
learning the language yourself.

00:12:47.909 --> 00:12:52.389
So after four years, I understand that you came back to visit your family.

00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:55.389
What events were challenging thereafter?

00:12:55.389 --> 00:12:57.909
I think Sandra can relate that.

00:12:57.909 --> 00:13:02.629
Well, it was usually permitted after you and your assignment four years.

00:13:02.629 --> 00:13:07.110
Then you were allowed to come home at least to have a vacation, visit your family.

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:09.909
And so we made arrangements to come back.

00:13:09.909 --> 00:13:14.110
We got some tickets on a Yugoslav freighter,

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:16.990
took us two weeks to get back to New York.

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:19.309
But we got back, we visited our family.

00:13:19.309 --> 00:13:23.830
And while there, I had a medical examination

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:26.230
and found out that I had a serious health problem.

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:28.429
Of course, we didn't have the funds to cover that.

00:13:28.429 --> 00:13:30.750
So Bill wrote to the society.

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:32.309
And we made arrangements.

00:13:32.309 --> 00:13:35.190
They said, we'll just take care of your situation

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.429
and let us know when you're free.

00:13:37.429 --> 00:13:43.230
So he got a job to take care of our medical needs as well as living conditions.

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:46.990
But you know, we just felt like we were failures.

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:49.190
I'd always wanted to be a missionary.

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:51.750
And there we were four years at our assignment.

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:55.509
We come back and plough. We're just there.

00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:58.070
But you know, Jehovah knew we were discouraged.

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:00.710
He knew we felt distraught about this.

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:02.830
So he knew just what we needed.

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:04.470
And he gave it to us.

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:10.110
As I got to feeling better and we got more free in our use of time,

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:15.429
we started pioneering and Jehovah blessed our ministry just incredibly.

00:14:15.429 --> 00:14:20.470
There were times in this supposedly unproductive territory

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:23.590
that we had up to 25 people attending the meetings.

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:27.230
Many of them got baptized and there are fast friends to this day.

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:31.230
That's incredible. So Jehovah knows what you need and he provides it.

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:33.509
That is beautiful.

00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:36.830
What temptation did you have to resist when you came back

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:38.350
and going through these difficulties?

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:43.110
I think it's a temptation that confronts a lot of brothers and sisters

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:45.350
who return because of health reasons.

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:50.149
And some just end up settling down because of their circumstances.

00:14:50.149 --> 00:14:52.710
But the temptation there was, well, your home,

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:56.389
you've already done your service in Morocco for a number of years.

00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:57.710
You've been in the full time ministry.

00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:01.029
Just settled down now by a house.

00:15:01.029 --> 00:15:03.389
But really, that wasn't our desire.

00:15:03.389 --> 00:15:06.870
So as soon as Sandra got on her feet and was feeling well enough,

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:08.470
we got pioneering.

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:11.230
And then I wrote headquarters and I said, here we are.

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:12.710
We're ready to take on whatever.

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:14.750
What would you like us to do?

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:19.669
You know, I'd like to say here, Ron, that I really appreciate

00:15:19.669 --> 00:15:21.909
Bill as my spiritual head.

00:15:21.909 --> 00:15:24.870
Because even those, these things presented themselves

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:28.029
in the course of our Theocratic history,

00:15:28.029 --> 00:15:31.750
he was always quick to accept the responsibility of what we felt

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:36.389
was our spiritual, familiar, and moral responsibility.

00:15:36.389 --> 00:15:39.750
But as soon as these obligations were taken care of,

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:44.269
he was very quick to get us back on the road to meet our spiritual goals

00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:46.350
that we had. And I really do appreciate that.

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:48.190
Good example. Thank you.

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:50.909
So you made yourself available to the organization.

00:15:50.909 --> 00:15:52.830
Where did they send you next?

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:54.230
A wonderful assignment.

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:59.230
We were sent as special pioneers to Washington, D.C.

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:02.750
to help start a Spanish congregation.

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:06.070
And that was indeed a very rich blessing.

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:10.149
We were there a year and a half until that little congregation

00:16:10.149 --> 00:16:12.750
was solid and was formed.

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:15.070
And then we received another blessing.

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:17.269
We pointed to the circuit work.

00:16:17.269 --> 00:16:19.909
So I had the Spanish circuit in Florida

00:16:19.909 --> 00:16:24.590
from Key West to Orlando, one circuit in the whole state.

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:27.750
Then we came to New York City, lived in the Bronx.

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:31.750
I had a circuit and we did district work in the Spanish field.

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:34.789
Then to Texas, to what they call the Valley of Texas,

00:16:34.789 --> 00:16:38.190
the Rio Grande Valley for a couple of years on the circuit.

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:42.230
And then the district in Spanish, from Houston, Texas

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:43.750
to Ubicity, California.

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:45.470
And we loved every minute of it.

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:47.629
Well, that's definitely the traveling work.

00:16:47.629 --> 00:16:49.909
I know you're in that work for nearly 10 years.

00:16:49.909 --> 00:16:52.590
So I'm sure you really benefited a lot of brothers

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:54.190
and sisters along the way.

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:57.909
Then 1977 rolls around and you receive another invitation.

00:16:57.909 --> 00:16:58.990
Yes, indeed.

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:02.269
We were doing pre-convention work in L.D.L.A.

00:17:02.269 --> 00:17:04.829
area at the Limerda Assembly Hall.

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:08.829
And we received a letter inviting us to come to Bethel.

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:12.349
And that was a very, very special privilege

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:13.950
to be invited to Bethel.

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:16.509
I went into the service department because at that time,

00:17:16.509 --> 00:17:18.750
they invited a number of traveling overseers

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:21.390
to come in and work in the service department.

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:23.470
And Sandra went into housekeeping

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:26.430
and we were both delighted to come to Bethel.

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:28.750
Well, sort of.

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:31.910
I really, I really loved the ministry.

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:34.069
I loved the, especially there's a district

00:17:34.069 --> 00:17:37.589
working with the circuit overseer and his wife every week

00:17:37.589 --> 00:17:38.990
and out service.

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:43.150
So I wasn't too anxious for this Bethel thing.

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:47.150
But you know, Jehovah again knows what you need.

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:51.269
We came here and we started adjusting to Bethel life

00:17:51.269 --> 00:17:54.430
and it really proved out to be a real blessing

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:57.549
because we got the close association

00:17:57.549 --> 00:18:01.269
with so many other loyal witnesses of Jehovah.

00:18:01.269 --> 00:18:02.109
Yes.

00:18:02.109 --> 00:18:03.990
And then for the rest of us that have been able to work

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:05.190
with you over the decades,

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:07.950
appreciate your loyal example working with you.

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:10.710
But I understand shortly after you arrived to Bethel,

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:14.750
you also received some challenging family difficulties

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:15.750
that you needed to deal with.

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:20.269
Yes, Sandra had an older sister who needed help.

00:18:20.269 --> 00:18:22.670
Yeah, we were still adjusting like I said.

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:26.269
And we heard that one of my older sisters

00:18:26.269 --> 00:18:29.630
that had spent most of her life in the Pioneer Service.

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:32.190
But she had now entered the terminal stages

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:34.309
in her long fight with cancer.

00:18:34.309 --> 00:18:36.990
And she needed some home care.

00:18:37.029 --> 00:18:42.349
And the brothers at the organization were very kind to me.

00:18:42.349 --> 00:18:44.390
And they allowed me some free time to go

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:46.750
and care for that responsibility.

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:48.750
Then it was just a few years later

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:52.029
that my mother was facing a similar situation.

00:18:52.029 --> 00:18:56.349
And this time again, the brothers allowed both Bill and I

00:18:56.349 --> 00:18:58.269
to be free to go back there.

00:18:58.269 --> 00:19:01.190
And my mother was now aged 89.

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:02.789
She had health situation.

00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:05.549
She lived alone so she needed care.

00:19:05.549 --> 00:19:07.869
And again, they allowed us this time.

00:19:07.869 --> 00:19:09.190
We went back.

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:11.509
And just as in the case with my sister,

00:19:11.509 --> 00:19:16.470
I was able to keep my mother home just until she died.

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:20.430
And we appreciate so much being granted that free time.

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:23.190
Even though when we left, we didn't know

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:26.190
if it might mean the end of our Bethel career.

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:31.029
But again, we felt the need to fulfill that responsibility.

00:19:31.029 --> 00:19:35.190
And you know, Ron, it was a better suite experience.

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:37.349
This is Satan's wicked world.

00:19:37.349 --> 00:19:39.029
Death is our enemy.

00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:41.829
And it hurts to see a loved one suffer.

00:19:41.829 --> 00:19:44.990
But you know, there's this sweet side of it, too,

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:48.509
because we had some shared some wonderful moments together

00:19:48.509 --> 00:19:52.950
with my family and experiences, shared experiences.

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:55.509
And we felt good that we had been

00:19:55.509 --> 00:19:58.990
able to help these people that had been mentors for us.

00:19:58.990 --> 00:19:59.750
Yes.

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:03.630
So loyalty to your family, loyalty to Jehovah.

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:05.150
So you return back to Bethel.

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:06.710
You were busy in your assignments.

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:09.430
And as you mentioned, you work with many loyal ones

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:10.150
at Bethel.

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:13.349
Could you share one such experience with a loyal sister?

00:20:13.349 --> 00:20:14.069
Oh, yes.

00:20:14.069 --> 00:20:16.589
I was assigned to the alterations department,

00:20:16.589 --> 00:20:18.269
the sewing department.

00:20:18.269 --> 00:20:22.190
And recently, before that sister,

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:24.269
Gertrude and her husband, Martin Putsinger,

00:20:24.269 --> 00:20:25.710
had been called into Bethel.

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:27.950
And he was a member of the governing body.

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:29.990
And she had been trained under a tailor.

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:32.589
So she was excellent in alterations.

00:20:32.589 --> 00:20:36.710
But most valuable were our spiritual conversations.

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:39.150
There's so much from that sister.

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:42.869
Once we were talking a group of us about what

00:20:42.869 --> 00:20:45.710
our relationship to Jehovah really means.

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:49.710
And Gertrude gave us her idea, her understanding

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:51.470
of her relationship with Jehovah.

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:54.589
She said, you know, sometimes in life,

00:20:54.589 --> 00:20:56.990
a situation presents itself.

00:20:56.990 --> 00:21:01.109
And it's so personal and so touching

00:21:01.109 --> 00:21:05.029
that you don't tell anybody about it, except Jehovah, of course.

00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:07.589
And she said, so you prayed at Jehovah,

00:21:07.589 --> 00:21:09.670
and you prayed at Jehovah.

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:11.509
And then passed a little time,

00:21:11.509 --> 00:21:13.869
and you feel he's answered your prayer.

00:21:13.869 --> 00:21:16.789
She said, you know, that is like a little thread

00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:19.269
that unites you with Jehovah.

00:21:19.269 --> 00:21:22.630
Now, this is the only person in the universe

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:25.309
that shares this experience with you.

00:21:25.309 --> 00:21:27.470
So it's very personal.

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:31.390
OK, time goes by another situation presents itself.

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:34.269
And you pray again, well, here's another thread.

00:21:34.269 --> 00:21:36.029
And over a period of time, you've

00:21:36.029 --> 00:21:40.630
got a bunch of threads connecting you with Jehovah.

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:44.670
And she says, and those threads are all knitted together.

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:48.670
And they form a cord that unites you with Jehovah.

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:51.670
And then she'd say, and don't you ever do anything

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:54.349
to endanger that relationship.

00:21:54.349 --> 00:21:57.069
But to me, it just really hit my heart.

00:21:57.069 --> 00:21:59.150
I thought, this is so true.

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:02.430
Our relationship with Jehovah and our loyalty to him

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:06.150
has to be the first important thing in our life.

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:07.269
Well, thank you for sharing that.

00:22:07.269 --> 00:22:09.269
That has affected all of our hearts.

00:22:09.269 --> 00:22:10.589
Appreciate that.

00:22:10.589 --> 00:22:13.789
So Bill, you have received many privileges of service

00:22:13.789 --> 00:22:17.750
before Bethel and you're 40 years since you've been at Bethel.

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:19.230
One of the privileges that you have had

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:21.950
is traveling to different branches

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:25.029
as a headquarters representative or a zone overseer.

00:22:25.029 --> 00:22:28.309
What are some memories you have of all those various visits?

00:22:28.309 --> 00:22:32.509
It's a very rich privilege to do it, Ron, to serve at that time

00:22:32.509 --> 00:22:34.269
as a zone overseer.

00:22:34.269 --> 00:22:36.150
The brothers receive you so well.

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:39.069
Basically, the zone overseer and now the branch represent it.

00:22:39.069 --> 00:22:41.190
If he goes to be of encouragement to brothers

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:44.470
and he visits the branch, meets with all the Bethelites

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:46.789
whenever possible, tries to talk to all of them,

00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:49.630
giving encouragement, meets with all of the missionaries

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:50.990
in the country.

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:53.430
And you'll receive so warmly.

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:57.549
I remember when Sandra and I visited Tahiti.

00:22:57.549 --> 00:23:00.750
We flew into Tahiti, Papayeti Tahiti.

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:04.349
And it was three in the morning when we arrived.

00:23:04.349 --> 00:23:06.430
The brothers were absolutely wonderful.

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:08.990
There were about 35 brothers waiting for us.

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:11.750
They're piling flower lays upon us,

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:14.069
giving us a kiss on each cheek,

00:23:14.069 --> 00:23:15.829
but the warmth of the brothers

00:23:15.829 --> 00:23:19.230
and the joy of being with the Bethel family was something.

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:22.430
That sister didn't have to find any room left on your cheek.

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:24.670
No, so I got a kiss on the top of the head.

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:27.150
But the joy of the brothers was just wonderful.

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:31.309
And we've had a great privilege of visiting a number of branches.

00:23:31.309 --> 00:23:33.549
And understand that you traveled to Bolivia

00:23:33.549 --> 00:23:36.470
and you had a nice experience in Bolivia.

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:39.950
I just love this work because I got to play missionary

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:41.150
when I was out there.

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:43.829
And of course, my heart was always in the missionary field.

00:23:43.829 --> 00:23:46.349
But I remember when we went to Bolivia,

00:23:46.349 --> 00:23:48.230
since it was a smaller branch,

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:51.349
I was allowed to go out and work in the service with the missionaries.

00:23:51.349 --> 00:23:53.789
And they came and they picked me up at 8 o'clock in the morning

00:23:53.789 --> 00:23:58.190
and they said, we're going to take you out to a midnight colony.

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:01.950
And so I left at 8 and I didn't get back to 11 o'clock at night.

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:05.549
And I was a little bit disturbed about that hour, that late or getting back.

00:24:05.549 --> 00:24:07.589
Well, you see, it's a midnight community.

00:24:07.589 --> 00:24:11.190
They don't have electricity and we didn't have cell phones at that time.

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:15.029
So he had no idea what was happening to me.

00:24:15.029 --> 00:24:18.029
But we studied all day with this family.

00:24:18.029 --> 00:24:21.710
And eventually, by the way, they all came in the truth.

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:25.630
And their experience came out in 2005.

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:28.589
September 1st, issue of the watchtower

00:24:28.589 --> 00:24:31.630
about this family of men and nights that came into the truth.

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:35.390
And now the work is spreading like wildfire among the men and nights.

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:41.069
But anyway, toward the end of the day, it was getting near dusk.

00:24:41.069 --> 00:24:43.549
And the missionary just teased me.

00:24:43.549 --> 00:24:47.789
He says to the family, well, it's time to melt the cows now.

00:24:47.789 --> 00:24:52.069
So bring up the meanest one you've gotten, ascended to milk her.

00:24:52.069 --> 00:24:55.029
So of course, he didn't know I was raised on a farm.

00:24:55.029 --> 00:24:59.269
So it had rained all day and it was muddy and nasty out there.

00:24:59.269 --> 00:25:03.589
But I had my hat heels on, silk blouse, ear rings.

00:25:03.589 --> 00:25:06.789
But we went out to the barn and they gave me a bucket.

00:25:06.789 --> 00:25:09.190
And I was able to melt the cow.

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:11.069
And she wasn't mean at all.

00:25:11.069 --> 00:25:14.670
Well, I'm sure you have many more experiences to let us know about.

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:16.910
But we appreciate you sharing those.

00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:20.750
The governing body has made significant adjustments

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:24.670
in the work that is taking place at Bethel and the field.

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:29.029
And it has affected many long time faithful brothers, loyal brothers,

00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:34.470
and in the traveling work, overseers in the congregation, overseers at Bethel.

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:38.309
Bill, what do you think about some of these changes

00:25:38.309 --> 00:25:40.150
that the governing body has made recently?

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:42.470
I think they're very wise decisions.

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:44.589
They know what is needed.

00:25:44.589 --> 00:25:47.470
They appreciate the older men who have served for years.

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:51.509
We know that the older brothers have been in circuit work, district work,

00:25:51.509 --> 00:25:53.950
wherever they're worthy of double honor

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:57.349
because of the way they've given of themselves to the work.

00:25:57.349 --> 00:26:00.230
But we have to recognize to their comes a time

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:05.430
when we want the younger men to come along, to accept responsibility.

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:10.029
And really, when we were young, we received responsibilities

00:26:10.029 --> 00:26:12.430
with very little background and training.

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:15.670
Now we've got all these schools for Kingdom of Angelizers,

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:18.670
the Ministry's Kingdom Ministry School,

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:21.589
so many opportunities for younger ones to be trained.

00:26:21.589 --> 00:26:24.750
And so I think it's a wonderful arrangement.

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:27.910
Many thousands of young men are doing so well,

00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:29.789
ready to accept responsibility.

00:26:29.789 --> 00:26:32.509
It's a blessing for the entire organization.

00:26:32.509 --> 00:26:33.990
Well, thank you for sharing that.

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:36.150
That will benefit many brothers.

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:38.509
So we look at this couple before us

00:26:38.509 --> 00:26:42.390
and we see someone who has made wise choices along the way.

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:46.349
So we look back at over 60 years of faithful, loyal service.

00:26:46.349 --> 00:26:52.309
As you look back at decisions you made in life, any regrets?

00:26:52.309 --> 00:26:55.029
Oh, absolutely none.

00:26:55.029 --> 00:26:59.710
We consider that whatever we have given up or done,

00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:02.069
it's been our gift to Jehovah.

00:27:02.069 --> 00:27:03.349
You know, when I was a little girl,

00:27:03.349 --> 00:27:05.910
I remember I used to go out on our farm and,

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:07.910
especially when there was a full moon.

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:10.430
And I used to pray to Jehovah and I'd say,

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:14.109
it just let me use up my life in your service.

00:27:14.109 --> 00:27:15.950
You know, he's answered that prayer

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:19.029
because my life is majority of it used up

00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:21.509
and he's let me do it in his service.

00:27:21.509 --> 00:27:24.349
Sort of makes me think of it one of my favorite scriptures,

00:27:24.349 --> 00:27:27.670
Jeremiah 29, 11.

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:30.670
It's where Jehovah referring to his faithful, loyal ones.

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:35.309
He says, I will know the thoughts I'm thinking towards you,

00:27:35.309 --> 00:27:38.789
not of calamity, but of peace

00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:41.109
and of future and of hope.

00:27:41.109 --> 00:27:44.430
Now, the calamities that we face in life,

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:46.109
that doesn't come from Jehovah.

00:27:46.109 --> 00:27:48.710
That comes from Satan's wicked old world.

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:52.109
But Jehovah promises us peace,

00:27:52.109 --> 00:27:54.269
a future and of hope.

00:27:54.269 --> 00:27:57.470
Now, how could you not be loyal to such a God?

00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:58.309
Beautiful.

00:27:58.309 --> 00:27:59.990
And Bill, how do you view sacrifices

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:01.869
that you have made along the way?

00:28:01.869 --> 00:28:05.710
Well, as you know, a sacrifice can be something you give up

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:07.630
to serve God, perhaps.

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:10.829
Or a sacrifice can be what you give to Jehovah.

00:28:10.829 --> 00:28:12.670
Like David said in Psalm 54,

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:15.509
I will sacrifice to you willingly.

00:28:15.509 --> 00:28:18.869
And that's how I view sacrifice.

00:28:18.869 --> 00:28:22.230
We're happy to give of ourselves to Jehovah God to serve Him.

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:26.269
And I want to add to Sandra has been a wonderful partner

00:28:26.269 --> 00:28:27.990
with me, willing to go anywhere,

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:31.750
put up with all kinds of circumstances and difficulties,

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:34.150
never complained about the travel,

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:37.990
or whatever circumstance we found ourselves in,

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:41.390
living very close to the earth for a number of years,

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:43.190
a special pioneers.

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:44.750
But Jehovah has been with us.

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:46.630
And a scripture that I,

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:48.069
there are a number of good scriptures,

00:28:48.069 --> 00:28:49.430
obviously, that we all love.

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:52.230
But one in particular that stays in my mind

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:55.910
is Romans chapter 14 verses 7 and 8.

00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:59.109
We live, we live to Jehovah.

00:28:59.109 --> 00:29:02.150
We die, we die to Jehovah.

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:04.349
So whether we live or we die,

00:29:04.349 --> 00:29:05.589
we belong to Jehovah.

00:29:05.589 --> 00:29:06.950
And we've made that decision,

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:08.829
not just because he's the creator.

00:29:08.829 --> 00:29:13.069
We've made the decision to give ourselves to Jehovah God.

00:29:13.069 --> 00:29:17.309
So absolutely, we've had the best life possible.

00:29:17.309 --> 00:29:21.309
We have no regrets at all about what we've done

00:29:21.309 --> 00:29:25.150
with our life giving Jehovah the first place.

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:27.150
Bill and Sandra, it's been a real privilege

00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:28.430
to hear more about you.

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:30.349
And I know there's more stories to tell.

00:29:30.349 --> 00:29:33.990
How can you boil down 60 plus years of loyal service

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:36.349
to Jehovah, but you have given us great insights.

00:29:36.349 --> 00:29:39.029
Thank you for sharing those gems with us.
