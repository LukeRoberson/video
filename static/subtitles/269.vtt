00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:06.269
Young ones, it's true that the more you understand Jehovah, the more you love him.

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:11.689
And what a blessing you have if your family worships Jehovah, with you and teaches you

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:13.710
how to draw close to him.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.510
But some young ones have had to build their faith without their family's support.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.910
Listen to the experience of Ersi Royer from the United States.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.269
What spiritual decision did she face at just 14 years old?

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:35.109
And what did she do that illustrates the value of deep personal study?

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:41.909
Growing up, it wasn't the typical, my mom's a pioneer, my dad's an elder, and we're doing

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:44.310
great in the congregation.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.829
My family life wasn't the best.

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.350
So why would I want to do this religion that nobody's happy in our family with?

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:00.829
And I think that could make you feel very alone or odd or awkward or secluded.

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.670
And at that time, I was graduating eighth grade, there were dances, friends were hanging

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.750
out, going to parties, and I remember thinking, wow, these look like really nice kits.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.230
Why wasn't I doing that?

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:21.069
I hadn't really delved into the Bible enough to answer questions that I really needed

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:22.430
to know.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.510
I went and prayed at Jehovah and said, I'm so sorry, but today I'm not a witness.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.310
I'm going to try to prove everything that I've been taught is wrong.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.150
I asked him if he's real to help me understand.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.950
So I go in my room, shut the door.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.069
I got every book off the shelf.

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:46.469
I started off organized, but by the end of the evening, I had books all over the place,

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:47.790
pages open.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.709
The more I kept reading about Jehovah, the more the next topic it would take me to to

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:55.390
then connect the scriptures.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.390
Jesus is linked to Jehovah, the angels are linked to Jehovah, resurrection is linked

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.390
to Jehovah.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.269
So you can't believe in one and not everything else if you really want to know the truth.

00:02:06.269 --> 00:02:12.270
And so that's what did it for me, especially the scripture in Psalms when it said that

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.509
you saw even the embryo of me.

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:21.830
And it was an emotional scripture for me because I thought, wow, my parents aren't doing great

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:29.590
in the truth right now, but Jehovah found a way to find me and he knew what I could be.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:30.590
Now I have my answer.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.229
I don't have an excuse.

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:35.150
Jehovah gave me enough knowledge that now I'm responsible.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.270
I now need to act on that and show my love and return for him.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.629
Within a week, I found another sister in the hall that was really helpful in me getting

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:46.789
out and service quite often.

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:51.550
I don't think to the stage she ever knows how much I appreciated that.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.270
Although things were declining in our family spiritually, I was able to get baptized as

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.469
I progressed spiritually.

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:03.310
I could see that I did not have the support of my family.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.870
But I had to trust that Jehovah would help me through it.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.069
And at least by the time I got home if there was an issue, I had the strength of the

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:16.830
meeting and the brothers and sisters in that joy that they couldn't take away from me.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.389
Remember I came home one day with some friends, it was a nice day, encouraging, upbuilding.

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:27.310
We pull in our driveway, they drop me off, say goodbye.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.110
My parents were really upset when they came and met me at the door.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:39.590
They couldn't fully understand why I was making my decisions.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.550
The way I was to serve Jehovah more fully.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:49.669
We just could not agree on where my relationship with Jehovah was going.

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:57.300
And at that point, I left with the clothes on my back in the matter of a few minutes

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:05.460
my life forever changed.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:13.439
I had a spiritual aunt that took me in and helped me gather myself together and literally

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:18.439
fed me, clothed me, helped me spiritually.

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:24.959
And so then my support became Jehovah and the congregation.

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:32.600
I remember a sister told me years ago, be who you needed when you were young.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.600
And so when I look at those little ones, I look at myself and say, how could I have benefited

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.199
from someone taking the time for me when I was that age?

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:47.720
I have always tried remembering the young ones because that's just part of who I am.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.319
And making sure that they know that they're not alone.

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:55.959
If there was a young one out there that wasn't sure if this is the truth or not, I would

00:04:55.959 --> 00:05:02.560
like them to know that Jehovah knows who they are and he's finding a way for them to

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:10.199
know him and that Jehovah is real and he knows them by name and he wants them to live

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:13.199
and he's fighting for them.

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:19.000
How amazing that young Hersey chose to spend an entire day studying, proving to herself

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.519
that Jehovah knew her and loved her.

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:25.439
But this was no one time study marathon.

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:31.040
From there she worked to develop the study habit she needed to endure, grow and become

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.079
a spiritual person.

00:05:33.079 --> 00:05:38.319
She pioneered for several years and now serves at Bethlehem with her husband, Jeff.

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:43.879
In my conversation with Hersey, she expressed her love for her family and the hope that

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:47.920
someday in the future she'll be reunited with them spiritually.
