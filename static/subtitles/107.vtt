00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:10.820
Welcome to J. W. Broadcasting. In this month's program, we'll examine what the good news is

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:18.179
and why it's such a blessing. We'll consider how examples from the Bible and our modern history

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:24.660
encourage us to declare all of the good news boldly. We'll learn from a faithful brother in

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.620
Rwanda how we can maintain our zeal for the good news despite persecution and imprisonment.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:39.460
And we'll enjoy a new music video that reminds us how much joy we can have sharing the good news

00:00:39.460 --> 00:01:10.109
with others. This is J. W. Broadcasting for October 2023. As Jehovah's Witnesses, we have a wonderful

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:17.629
privilege, the privilege of declaring the good news, but just what does that good news include?

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.750
If we know the answer, how will that motivate us to be even more zealous as we declare the good

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:32.269
news? Let's consider the answers to those questions. First of all, what is the good news?

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:39.230
We get an idea by looking at how this expression is used in the Bible. For example,

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:46.750
we read of the good news of the kingdom, the good news of God, the good news about Jesus Christ,

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:55.709
the good news of the undeserved kindness of God, the good news of peace, and the ever-lasting good

00:01:55.709 --> 00:02:04.670
news. So we can say that the good news refers to the rule of God's kingdom and salvation by faith in

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:11.629
Jesus. This includes all the truths about which Jesus spoke and the disciples wrote.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:20.270
Through the prophet Isaiah, Jehovah spoke about the preaching of the good news. Isaiah's prophecy

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:26.669
described the purpose and effect of the good news to be preached, particularly from the time of

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:36.189
Messiah's coming. Notice what's recorded at Isaiah 61, 1 and 2. The spirit of the sovereign

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:44.030
Lord Jehovah is upon me, because Jehovah anointed me to declare good news to the meek. He sent me

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:51.069
to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the wide opening of the

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:58.590
eyes to the prisoners, to proclaim the year of Jehovah's good will, and the day of vengeance of our

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:06.909
God, to comfort all who mourn. This good news would have a positive effect on those who'd listen to

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:14.669
it. It would bind up the brokenhearted, and comfort all who mourn. This is likely the kind of good

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:21.389
news that we talk about most in our ministry. The prospect of enjoying everlasting life in an

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:28.750
earthly paradise under the rule of God's kingdom provides hope to our listeners and motivates them

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:36.750
to love Jehovah. However, the good news also includes something else, something that we may not

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.430
talk about as readily in our ministry. You may have noticed in Isaiah the expression,

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:49.870
and the day of vengeance of our God. So there's more to the good news than just the year of

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:58.030
Jehovah's good will. We see this clearly in the words recorded at Revelation 14, 6 and 7.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:06.990
And I saw another angel flying in mid-Heaven, and he had everlasting good news to declare to those

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:14.590
who dwell on the earth, to every nation and tribe and tongue and people. He was saying in a loud

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:23.230
voice, fear God, and give him glory, because the hour of judgment by him has arrived. So worship

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.589
the one who made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and the springs of water.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.430
Evidently, the everlasting good news also includes a judgment message.

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:39.230
What is the hour of judgment mentioned in this verse?

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:46.990
According to some reference works, the original language term here rendered judgment refers to a

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:56.029
legal process of judgment, a scrutiny of conduct. So God is looking closely at conduct, how people

00:04:56.029 --> 00:05:04.350
act, that is the basis for judgment. The hour of judgment mentioned in this verse includes both the

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:12.350
pronouncement and the execution of divine judgment against all false religion, Babylon the Great,

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:19.709
and all other parts of Satan's system of things. Of course, Babylon the Great in this world's

00:05:19.709 --> 00:05:27.629
institutions have already been judged. However, their sentence has yet to be carried out. When will

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:36.110
that happen? Toward the end of the hour of judgment which will conclude at the climax of the last

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:43.629
days with the destruction of the present wicked system. That's why the actions of people today

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:50.750
matter so much. It's increasingly urgent that we proclaim the judgment aspect of the good news

00:05:50.829 --> 00:05:59.470
to them because the time when God will execute judgment is fast approaching. Why, though, can we say that

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:08.269
this judgment message is good news? It's good news for honest hearted ones because it means the

00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:16.110
end of wickedness, including all forms of injustice and violence. For those who are suffering as a

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:23.470
result of the bad actions of the wicked, this judgment will bring great relief. It will be a clear

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:31.629
demonstration of Jehovah's love and justice. However, it will be bad news for those who stubbornly

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:40.910
refuse to live by Jehovah's righteous standards. In Bible times, Jehovah warned of various acts of

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:48.750
judgment that he would bring against those who deliberately disobeyed his commands. In each case,

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:55.550
he informed the affected people well in advance and instructed them to make changes that were in

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:03.470
harmony with his will. To encourage the right response, he often used his loyal servants on earth to

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:12.589
announce his judgments and to convey a sense of urgency. For example, think of Noah. For years,

00:07:12.589 --> 00:07:18.350
he fearlessly warned the immoral and violent people of his day about a coming global flood.

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:25.629
He also told them what they needed to do to survive. What about Moses and Aaron?

00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:34.430
Jehovah used them to warn Pharaoh and his servants. For example, think about the specific warning

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:43.629
Jehovah gave regarding the seventh plague, a devastating hailstorm. At Exodus 9, 18, and 19, we read

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:50.350
that Moses and Aaron gave the people the time and the information they needed to protect themselves

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:57.870
from the storm. Yes, Jehovah always makes sure that people have sufficient opportunity to heed his

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:06.750
warnings. 2 Peter 3.9 says, He does not desire anyone to be destroyed, but desires all to attain

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:13.790
to repentance. The good news we are now preaching informs people not only of the marvelous hope for

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:21.550
the future that Jehovah offers, but also of what we must do to enjoy that hope. That's why we

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:28.110
need to let people know about Jehovah soon to come judgment. Notice how the preaching of the good

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:37.230
news is tied to divine judgment at Matthew 24-14. And this good news of the kingdom will be preached

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:44.350
in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come.

00:08:45.389 --> 00:08:51.629
Note how the good news serves as a witness to everyone who hears it. Depending on what they do

00:08:51.629 --> 00:08:59.789
with it, it will result in their eventual acquittal or condemnation. Just as a court takes time to

00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:07.789
hear all the facts and to weigh all the evidence, Jesus is wisely using his time now to judge people

00:09:07.789 --> 00:09:15.230
fairly. Both he and Jehovah continue to analyze the conduct of individuals and how they respond to

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:22.429
the good news that we're preaching. How should what we've just considered about the good news affect

00:09:23.149 --> 00:09:30.830
us? For one thing, we will not hold back from sharing all of the good news. We will talk about the

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:37.230
future blessings God has promised, as well as God's judgment of the wicked, which will make these

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:44.590
blessings possible. Imagine for a moment that you knew that a dangerous storm was bearing down on

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:51.149
where you lived. What would you do? Wouldn't you try to be as prepared as possible so that you could

00:09:51.149 --> 00:09:57.789
successfully weather the storm? Wouldn't you warn your family, friends, even neighbors, and try to help

00:09:57.789 --> 00:10:05.629
them to do the same? In a similar way, we try to help as many people as possible to prepare for the

00:10:05.629 --> 00:10:13.789
impending execution of Jehovah's judgments on this world. While being tactful, we do not hold back

00:10:13.789 --> 00:10:20.830
from letting people know what they need to do to be saved. For example, we help our Bible students

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:28.669
to understand what they need to do in a frank yet kind way. We help them to see what changes they

00:10:28.669 --> 00:10:37.629
need to make to harmonize their lives with Jehovah's standards. Our new study tool, Enjoy Life Forever,

00:10:37.629 --> 00:10:44.429
is designed to help us do such teaching. It includes several features to help our Bible students

00:10:44.429 --> 00:10:52.830
qualify to preach the good news as soon as possible. For example, at the end of each section,

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:59.789
there's a review with questions, some of which are quite pointed. Considering these questions with

00:10:59.789 --> 00:11:05.710
our students can help them to see what they need to do to apply what they've been learning in their

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:13.309
Bible study. We'll have an opportunity to watch a video later on in this program that will demonstrate

00:11:13.309 --> 00:11:20.029
some of the features in Enjoy Life Forever and how we can use them to help our Bible students.

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:28.190
Understanding the importance of the good news will also motivate us to preach and teach it with

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:34.830
urgency. We'll strive to have a full share in all aspects of the ministry available to us.

00:11:35.789 --> 00:11:42.669
Rather than taking a casual approach, we'll be zealous and work at it whole sold as for Jehovah.

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:51.389
Why? Because we realize that people's lives are at stake. They urgently need to hear the good news

00:11:51.389 --> 00:11:59.309
and respond to it. Of course, we all have different circumstances and abilities. We know that

00:11:59.309 --> 00:12:06.830
Jehovah and Jesus take this into account. In Jesus' illustration of the talents, not all the slaves

00:12:06.909 --> 00:12:14.110
were given the same number of talents. Rather, the talents were distributed according to their ability.

00:12:15.149 --> 00:12:22.509
This reminds us that Jehovah and Jesus are aware of our personal situations. They know what we

00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:29.710
can reasonably do and they never expect anything beyond that, nor do they compare us to our fellow

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:36.990
brothers and sisters. Knowing this is very comforting because we may not always be able to do all

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:44.110
that we want to do in the preaching work. That's often the case with our dear older ones and others

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:52.429
who cope with serious limitations. However, we can all feel confident that as long as we do our personal

00:12:52.509 --> 00:12:59.149
best, Jehovah will be pleased with us. I'll never forget our work and the love that we show.

00:13:00.669 --> 00:13:08.029
So may each of us continue to do all that we can to share the good news, all of the good news.

00:13:08.669 --> 00:13:16.269
By doing so, we will experience great joy and contentment as we participate in this life-saving

00:13:16.269 --> 00:13:24.029
work, helping as many as possible before it's too late. Do you sometimes worry, though,

00:13:24.029 --> 00:13:28.669
how people might react, especially to a stronger judgment message?

00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:36.029
Facing this fear is not new. God's people in ancient and modern times have dealt with it, too.

00:13:36.909 --> 00:13:43.710
In the following demonstration, let's see what one brother is moved to do after meditating on their

00:13:43.710 --> 00:14:18.659
examples. Good morning. Sorry I was running a little behind this morning, but at least I come

00:14:18.659 --> 00:14:28.350
bearing gifts. Oh, no worries. Thank you. I could really use it today. You are also thinking about

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:43.759
that announcement about the special preaching campaign? Yeah, yeah, it was. Don't take what I'm

00:14:43.759 --> 00:14:51.279
going to say the wrong way, but don't you think the message will be preaching is pretty harsh?

00:14:54.259 --> 00:15:02.580
No, I wouldn't say that, but it's definitely very direct. I mean, people already get defensive

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:07.539
whenever you challenge their beliefs, and this is going to be next level.

00:15:08.899 --> 00:15:14.899
This isn't going to be the easiest message to deliver, but you know, it's not the first time we've

00:15:14.899 --> 00:15:20.659
done this. Really? Absolutely. I don't know if you remember me telling you that my families

00:15:20.659 --> 00:15:27.539
originally from Quebec and my dad was part of an incredibly hard-hitting witness back in the 40s.

00:15:27.539 --> 00:15:35.700
I looked this up last night. He had to distribute a tract that called out the local religious leaders

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:42.980
as hypocrites. What were they doing? They were inciting their followers to mob violence against

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:49.379
the witnesses, telling them to vandalize our properties, even getting brothers falsely arrested

00:15:49.379 --> 00:15:56.019
and imprisoned. Wow, and they had to distribute that tract during the violence. They had to.

00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:05.710
Jehovah wanted to show how unjust their actions were, but I remember my dad telling me,

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:14.110
he said that initially he was pretty terrified. Yeah, I mean, that's how I feel. I'm

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:22.350
I'm terrified. It's normal to feel that way. I've been thinking about it myself,

00:16:23.549 --> 00:16:30.350
and I thought it'd been an account in Exodus. It's where Moses tells the Israelites to splatter

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:35.389
the blood of a ram on their doorposts in order to avoid the effects of the last plague.

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:41.549
And I thought about how some of the Israelites might have felt about doing that back then.

00:16:46.419 --> 00:16:47.299
Everything.

00:16:47.299 --> 00:16:55.570
Brams are sacred to the Egyptians. Yeah, this would be an affront to Amin wrong.

00:16:55.570 --> 00:17:03.500
How are the Egyptians going to react? I know, I've thought about that too.

00:17:04.539 --> 00:17:18.910
Does Moses know what he's asking us to do? Brothers, I don't know if we have anything to worry about.

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:27.779
We don't have anything to fear. Think of how Jehovah's protected us with these last legs.

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:36.369
And as for the blood, it's not a matter of offending man.

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:47.519
It's a matter of protecting us. It's showing who's side we're on. Jehovah's side.

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:56.500
Looking back, what the Israelites did was actually good news.

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:03.539
It meant their deliverance. And it's the same with any message we bear today.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:11.220
Let me show you one of my favorite scriptures in Isaiah chapter 41, verse 10.

00:18:12.819 --> 00:18:18.980
It says, Do not be afraid for I am with you. Do not be anxious for I am your God.

00:18:19.539 --> 00:18:26.420
I will fortify you. Yes, I will help you. I will really hold on to you with my right hand of righteousness.

00:18:30.289 --> 00:18:38.849
The fear we feel is natural. But remember, Jehovah was with the Israelites.

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:49.650
He was with my dad. And he will be with us. The message we are sharing is good news.

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:59.339
The faithful record of God's servants, ancient and modern,

00:18:59.339 --> 00:19:04.299
strengthens us to carry out our preaching work and declare the good news.

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:11.420
Meditating on Jehovah's unfailing support can help us overcome any fear we may have.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:17.259
Our Bible students face many challenges as they learn about the good news.

00:19:18.059 --> 00:19:23.420
They may need to make drastic changes to harmonize their lives with Jehovah's standards.

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:31.339
This can be difficult. How can we help them make these changes so that they can begin sharing

00:19:31.339 --> 00:19:38.779
the good news alongside us? Enjoy life forever has been designed to help us do just that.

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:44.460
Let's see encouraging evidence that this powerful tool is really working.

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:54.829
When I heard about the new publication to enjoy life over a book,

00:19:54.829 --> 00:20:03.069
I was very nervous. It was change, and sometimes I don't like change, but I know that it was for

00:20:03.069 --> 00:20:10.720
the best. I just needed to try it out. I didn't have a progressive Bible study in years,

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:14.880
but the book, the way it was designed, was to help me as a teacher.

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:21.039
Once the features of this new publication were explained, it was going to help us to help our

00:20:21.039 --> 00:20:27.119
Bible students begin preaching in the ministry, as well as helping our Bible students make changes

00:20:27.119 --> 00:20:31.119
in their everyday life. And we were really excited about using those features to help our students

00:20:31.119 --> 00:20:39.539
to do so. I like the some people say section at the bottom of the lesson, because that helps prepare

00:20:39.539 --> 00:20:46.740
her for informal witnessing. It helps them to formulate in their own words how to defend their

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:52.339
faith or how to preach informally or use those opportunities to share what they just learned.

00:20:53.299 --> 00:20:59.859
This was her way of learning how to feel comfortable talking to others about Jehovah and teaching

00:20:59.859 --> 00:21:06.259
others about Jehovah. You're right away from lesson one, lesson two, encouraging them to recognize that

00:21:06.259 --> 00:21:10.099
it's not just about what they're learning, but it's also about what they can share with others.

00:21:11.059 --> 00:21:17.380
As the Bible teacher, it helps us to round out the rough edges so that when they do speak to others,

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:22.579
it's tactful. You know, I put her in that place like, what would you say if someone told you that

00:21:22.579 --> 00:21:28.099
Jesus was God? Like, how would you answer that question? And that went to her heart and she was able

00:21:28.099 --> 00:21:32.420
to answer the question, well, I would tell them this. I would say this because that's exactly what

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:38.099
happened. She was telling her family about the lessons that she was learning the things that she

00:21:38.099 --> 00:21:43.140
learned from the Bible. So all along, she was informal witnessing and not realizing that's what she

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:48.579
was doing. So when you see that connection between what they're learning and how they can use what

00:21:48.579 --> 00:21:54.099
they learn, there's just it's just a wonderful feeling because you recognize that now they'll be

00:21:54.099 --> 00:22:02.960
able to teach somebody else. One thing that the book also does is that it progressively helps the

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:07.759
student to make changes in their personal life in order to live by Jehovah's standards.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:14.799
Now, this section review is a series of questions that usually has a key question or a key verse

00:22:14.799 --> 00:22:20.720
related to that lesson. So before going on to the next section, it's almost like a filter. It stops

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:26.240
them, helps in the review and helps the teacher realize, hmm, they don't quite understand that point.

00:22:27.599 --> 00:22:32.319
They are excellent because they can get the expressions from your student where now you can

00:22:32.319 --> 00:22:40.319
really focus on what exactly are the issues that they're having. I was able to see if she had any

00:22:40.319 --> 00:22:48.480
gray areas if there was a problem or she didn't understand something. Are they saying the book says

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:55.599
or you taught me this, then you know, okay, they need to be reminded of the scriptures and you need

00:22:55.599 --> 00:23:02.240
to see that truce a little bit deeper into their heart. That's where I saw my student express

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:09.039
herself and let me know things she was thinking or things that were bothering her. She realized

00:23:09.039 --> 00:23:15.519
that she needed to make changes with. The questions are a bit more personal than maybe you would have

00:23:15.519 --> 00:23:22.400
asked in the past. They're a bit more pointed than maybe we have the habit of asking. Comparing my

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:29.039
questions I used in the past or what's in the enjoy life forever book, I mean, I wasn't getting

00:23:29.039 --> 00:23:35.519
anywhere. These questions really help the students speak their heart and I'm so glad they're there.

00:23:37.119 --> 00:23:42.559
It takes time. It also takes patience and love on our part to let them make those changes so

00:23:42.559 --> 00:23:51.900
they can qualify to become an unbeatenized publisher. Dispublication to enjoy life for a book,

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:58.700
it's like no other. It makes it much easier for them or you can help them much faster to get there.

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:05.900
That book has helped a lot. It definitely boosted my confidence. It was designed to just

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:11.740
bring people right into the truth. Like she said, the book was me especially for her. When the time

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:19.259
came for her to do door-to-door ministry, she was ready. My student has already started several

00:24:19.259 --> 00:24:25.660
Bible studies. This study program has trained him now to be a Bible teacher.

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:32.380
If you follow everything that's in the book, it's like a complete study. There's little that we can

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:42.990
add ourselves. It's all there. Enjoy life forever has many well-worded questions, some of which are

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:49.630
quite pointed to help our students reason on God's Word and to think deeply about the changes they

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:56.109
need to make to please Jehovah. The publication also shows them how to preach informally

00:24:56.109 --> 00:25:01.549
and stresses how important it is for all of us to share what we know with others.

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:08.670
Everyone who serves Jehovah has the responsibility to declare all of the good news.

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:16.430
Paul reminded us at First Thessalonians 2, 2, that we would need boldness to preach the good

00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:23.950
news in the face of much opposition. How can we do that? Let's learn from Brother Gaspar,

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:31.549
Rwaka Bubu's experience, and see how he maintained his zeal through persecution and imprisonment.

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:41.440
During the 1970s, the preaching work was not recognized in Rwanda. When my family and I received

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:48.480
a letter of invitation to go serve there, we were living a good life. We had some concerns,

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:57.039
but praying to Jehovah and asking him for direction helped us. I disgusted with my wife,

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:08.000
and we were both positive about it. We made a request for legal recognition in 1982, but instead,

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:15.599
myself and two other brothers were thrown into prison. One day on a Sunday,

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:22.720
the Archbishop came to the prison and he announced, the wear of those Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:30.559
As a result of that, he raised the curiosity of his listeners. The prisoners wanted some

00:26:30.559 --> 00:26:40.269
explanations from us, because they could not understand what he meant. Many began to join our

00:26:40.269 --> 00:26:51.490
meetings. The Archbishop was not happy. He grew even angrier, and in order to stop our activities,

00:26:53.009 --> 00:26:58.049
he told his close followers to beat us up when we attended the following meeting.

00:27:00.769 --> 00:27:07.569
Two young prisoners approached us, and they said, today, they planned to beat you up.

00:27:09.009 --> 00:27:16.319
When our meeting time came, we didn't show up. Another religious group came and took our

00:27:16.319 --> 00:27:22.319
place at night, so they were the ones who got beaten up. From that time on, no one disturbed us

00:27:22.319 --> 00:27:26.079
any longer. We continued preaching and attending meetings peacefully.

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:37.390
After spending two years in prison, we were freed. Outside of prison, the brothers were not

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:46.059
free to preach. Many more brothers and sisters kept being arrested and imprisoned. Later,

00:27:46.779 --> 00:27:53.420
I was put in prison again, and the imprisoned brothers rejoiced over my presence, saying,

00:27:53.420 --> 00:28:00.539
we now have our circuit overseer visiting us. They were very happy. We started working together

00:28:00.539 --> 00:28:09.740
in harmony and preaching. Each one was assigned a territory. Some were discouraged, but I tried

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:19.059
to strengthen and encourage them to hold on to Jehovah. Then, brothers from all over the world

00:28:20.019 --> 00:28:27.299
started to write to the head of state. Letters were coming in huge quantities. Those

00:28:27.299 --> 00:28:33.700
letters had a good impact, because finally, one day, an announcement was made on the radio by

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:39.859
the president himself, saying that he pardoned Jehovah's witnesses. The people on the street

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:53.299
started shouting at us. Jehovah has won. Jehovah has won. He has won. The work of Jehovah's witnesses

00:28:54.500 --> 00:29:05.390
was legally recognized in 1992. Sadly, in 1994, during the time of genocide,

00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:16.529
some of our brothers died and others faced serious challenges. Some fled to Goma as refugees.

00:29:17.329 --> 00:29:23.329
I received the assignment to oversee the relief funds that were coming from Kinshasa.

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:29.250
One day, I had just collected the relief money for our refugee brothers,

00:29:30.529 --> 00:29:35.970
and I was stopped by two policemen. They possibly thought that they could get that money,

00:29:38.099 --> 00:29:47.490
so they asked me to go with them to their superior. As we were walking, I remember the prayer

00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:53.490
that our daughter Debra said during the genocide, while the whole family was praying silently.

00:29:54.130 --> 00:30:02.609
She prayed out loud, pouring her heart out to Jehovah. Thanks to that, they refrained from killing us.

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:13.410
This moved me to pray in my heart too. As soon as I said, Amen. The two policemen turned right

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:19.650
and went to meet their colleague. I also saw in front of me a brother holding a black suitcase,

00:30:20.369 --> 00:30:26.529
looking exactly like the one I had with the money. I handed him mine full of money,

00:30:26.529 --> 00:30:32.369
and he gave me his with literature inside. Then, without delay, the policemen said,

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:39.329
let's go now. Let's go. We walked all the way to the chief of police, but they found nothing.

00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:46.450
They were holding their chins in their hands, saying, this is a miracle. How could the money we saw

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:54.289
turn into books? In all the trials I've encountered, I really saw Jehovah's powerful hand.

00:30:55.490 --> 00:31:02.289
As a house built on a rock that is struck by storms, hit by anything, but remains firm.

00:31:03.089 --> 00:31:09.329
We too met with many trying challenges, but Jehovah continued to make us firm,

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:19.759
just like a house built on a rock. A scripture founded Isaiah 54 verse 17 explains that in reality.

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:29.200
All those fighting against us, no matter who they are, will never succeed. Up until this moment,

00:31:29.839 --> 00:31:36.400
although my physical strength is gradually fading, I feel that the power to serve Jehovah is growing

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:46.079
so much. In fact, I feel more powerful than ever. My determination is that, no matter the situation,

00:31:46.079 --> 00:31:56.380
I will continue to serve Jehovah. I've met Brother Rwaka Bubu and personally heard many of his

00:31:56.380 --> 00:32:04.059
amazing experiences, some of which he acted out for me. The experience of his daughter's prayer

00:32:04.059 --> 00:32:11.339
can be found on pages 198 and 199 of the 2012 yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:18.220
Brother Rwaka Bubu's daughter was six years old when she prayed in front of a group of soldiers.

00:32:19.099 --> 00:32:26.059
The soldiers were planning to kill the entire family, including Brother Rwaka Bubu's five children.

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:33.740
However, her innocent and earnest prayer touched the hearts of those hardened soldiers.

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:41.900
Today, Brother Rwaka Bubu deals with various health issues that resulted from his persecution

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:50.220
and imprisonment. However, Brother Rwaka Bubu's reliance on Jehovah and his love of the good news

00:32:50.299 --> 00:32:59.660
has enabled him to maintain his zeal even as his grown older. Sharing the good news informally

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:08.380
can have powerful results, but to be effective, we need to be prepared. How? As we'll see in the

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:14.380
following morning worship, we can learn from the example of the great teacher, Jesus.

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:23.779
Jesus as the great teacher created opportunities to witness to others. And of course,

00:33:23.779 --> 00:33:30.259
an excellent example of that is found in John chapter 4. So if you turn with me please to

00:33:30.259 --> 00:33:38.500
John chapter 4, let's analyze how Jesus was able to do in formal witnessing and we'll see what

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:44.259
lessons we can learn from it. So looking at John chapter 4 to get the background, we see in

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:52.180
verses 3 through 6, he mentions that Jesus left Judea and he was going towards Galilee.

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:57.539
But he decided to go through Samaria and ended up in Cyca.

00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:04.019
Looking at the study note, we notice that this was a journey that involved an

00:34:04.019 --> 00:34:13.619
ascent of some 3,000 feet. Now that's a very high elevation to climb up to. In rough terms,

00:34:13.619 --> 00:34:21.059
we could say it's like going up 30, sorry, 300 floors or stories in a building. Imagine how you

00:34:21.059 --> 00:34:26.579
would feel at the end of that. So if Jesus and His apostles had made that journey that morning,

00:34:27.219 --> 00:34:31.460
it's no wonder that in verse 6 it says that he was tired out. He was sitting there

00:34:32.099 --> 00:34:38.420
and it mentions in verse 6 to it was the 6th hour or about midday. So imagine the setting,

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:48.900
Jesus is in Samaria, he's tired and it's about midday. Not the best circumstances for starting

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:55.139
to witness. So what's the first lesson we learned from this? Jesus didn't wait for the perfect

00:34:55.139 --> 00:35:02.019
opportunity to inform a witness. Now he used whatever opportunity came up and created opportunities.

00:35:02.739 --> 00:35:08.980
So of course the woman comes along and notice in verse 7 how Jesus introduced or started this

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:16.820
conversation. He simply said, give me a drink. He didn't dive into some deep spiritual discussion,

00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:23.619
but rather just started talking to the woman. For what lesson do we learn from that? You see if

00:35:24.099 --> 00:35:29.619
we're interested in witnessing to others informally, perhaps all it takes is just greeting them,

00:35:29.619 --> 00:35:35.699
saying hello, and of course if they're not even willing to start talking to us, it's very hard

00:35:35.699 --> 00:35:44.099
to go much further. So that's the first lesson. How did the woman respond? Well, we'll notice as we

00:35:44.099 --> 00:35:50.739
go through John chapter 4, there were at least four potential problems that Jesus had to avoid

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:56.820
as he continued this discussion. The first of these problems is recorded in verse 9,

00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:04.019
this straight away she says, you're a Jew and I'm a Samaritan woman. How come you're talking to me?

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:12.340
So she referred to his appearance, his background. Well, in a similar way today sometimes someone

00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:19.539
may take a look at us and refer to our color or racial background or nationality and that could

00:36:19.539 --> 00:36:26.739
be a negative thing. But what did Jesus say? Well, he didn't respond and say, you know,

00:36:26.739 --> 00:36:33.699
I'm a nice person, that's how come I'm willing to talk to you. Now, he completely avoided that

00:36:33.699 --> 00:36:41.619
whole issue and focused on the spiritual message that he wanted to convey to her. So we noticed

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:51.940
that in verse 10, he speaks of the free gift of God and he also mentions that this woman could get

00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:58.980
living water, not just the water that she was interested in at that point. Now, when we analyze

00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:05.860
how the conversation went, we can see clearly that Jesus laid the foundation here at this point

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:12.099
for what he was going to say later. You see, he started with water, then he mentions God's gifts

00:37:12.099 --> 00:37:16.980
and living water and we'll see how he develops that a little further as we go on.

00:37:18.099 --> 00:37:24.900
Well, what happened at that point when he offered this living water? Well, in verse 11,

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:31.380
notice she says, you don't even have a bucket. So in other words, she was basically saying,

00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:39.460
I don't believe you. The well is very deep. The study note says maybe about 75 for deep. So

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:45.940
this is a negative reaction on her part, followed up by something else that was very controversial

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:54.099
in Jesus' day. She says, do you think you're better than our forefather Jacob? Now, that was very

00:37:54.099 --> 00:37:59.380
controversial because the average Jew in those days would have objected to that comment,

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:06.340
saying that she wasn't a relative of Jacob. So here we have another two possible problems.

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:14.659
How did Jesus handle it? Well, he just focused back on the spiritual message. As we mentioned,

00:38:14.659 --> 00:38:21.699
as recorded in verse 10, he started with water, God's gift and living water. And then if we look

00:38:21.699 --> 00:38:29.139
at verse 14, he speaks about drinking water that you would never get thirsty at all again. And then

00:38:29.139 --> 00:38:38.179
he introduces the concept or thought of everlasting life. So obviously Jesus had in his mind a plan

00:38:38.179 --> 00:38:44.420
of action or a little outline how he could develop a certain theme. And that was to do with water

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:51.940
leading to everlasting life. Well, how did the woman respond at that point? Notice verse 15,

00:38:52.739 --> 00:39:00.260
she says, sir, give me this water. Now, was she saying, please, I really want it? Or was she perhaps a

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:06.500
little cynical, maybe even a little psychastic? Well, it's hard for us to tell. It doesn't seem

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:13.219
until later that she fully believed Jesus. But whatever the case, it perhaps could in a modern

00:39:13.219 --> 00:39:20.820
setting be like her saying, that sounds good, but it's too good to be true. Did that stop Jesus?

00:39:21.699 --> 00:39:29.940
No. Jesus then basically changes the direction of the conversation and gives her an opportunity to

00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:37.539
show her honesty. Jesus realized that she was coming at that time of the day to avoid perhaps

00:39:37.539 --> 00:39:45.940
others seeing her. Why? Well, in verse 16, Jesus says to recall your husband. She says, I don't have

00:39:46.019 --> 00:39:53.780
a husband. Very honest comment to a stranger. Then Jesus said, you're right. You had five husbands,

00:39:53.780 --> 00:40:01.380
and the man you're with now is not your husband. You have said truthfully. Well, now what do we learn

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:08.099
from this? You see, although Jesus knew that she was living in an immoral relationship,

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:15.219
still, that wasn't the focus. He gave her an opportunity to express herself, and then what did he

00:40:15.219 --> 00:40:22.739
do? He commended her. So in a similar way, it's good for us to always try to find points that we

00:40:22.739 --> 00:40:28.099
can commend the persons for, even if they say something that is totally opposite to what the

00:40:28.099 --> 00:40:33.780
Bible says. We can at least thank them for expressing their viewpoint and being honest about it.

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:42.739
So as we continue on, we then see at this point, the woman has really taken notice because she says,

00:40:42.739 --> 00:40:49.699
I see that you're a prophet. But then the next problem, the fourth problem comes in. What does she

00:40:49.699 --> 00:40:56.980
say? Well, we worship here, Mount Gerasim, but you Jews, you say we should worship in Jerusalem.

00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:03.219
So basically, a modern equivalent of saying, I have my own religion, and it's different from yours.

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:11.380
Well, how did Jesus deal with that potential problem? But when we look at verse 21, it's interesting

00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:18.820
to see how he starts the answer by saying, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain,

00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:26.260
nor in Jerusalem, will you worship the Father? So basically, Jesus was just allowing her concern and

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:31.139
saying, well, don't worry, in the future, this is not going to be an issue, whether it's here or

00:41:31.139 --> 00:41:38.739
there. And then he goes on to explain, the important thing is to worship the Father with spirit and

00:41:38.739 --> 00:41:46.659
truth. So what do we see from that? Jesus tried to help her to see that what she perceived as

00:41:46.659 --> 00:41:52.820
being a problem really wasn't an issue at all. It wasn't something they had to go through and

00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:58.900
and explain all the details. Of course, he did mention that salvation began with the Jews,

00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:06.659
but then he showed her very clearly what she needed to do. Now, why was that so important?

00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:14.900
Well, if we turn later to the book of Acts chapter 8 and verse 14, there's a very interesting study

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:21.940
note there that tells us that what Jesus did on this occasion in witnessing to this woman and then

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:29.460
to various ones in her community laid the basis for what Philip, the evangelizer, would later do when

00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:36.179
he moved to Samaria, and he would help many there to become Christians. And ultimately, they became

00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:43.780
anointed Christians. So Jesus, a conversation here with this woman certainly was very, very successful.

00:42:44.579 --> 00:42:50.099
So what have we learned from this discussion looking through John chapter 4? First of all,

00:42:50.099 --> 00:42:56.260
Jesus didn't wait for the perfect opportunity. He created that opportunity. Secondly,

00:42:56.260 --> 00:43:02.340
he wasn't distracted or sidetracked by the various issues, some of them conversial that this

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:09.139
woman raised, but he focused on a spiritual theme. He had something in mind where he would use

00:43:09.139 --> 00:43:16.739
water to eventually describe everlasting life. And then he commended her for her honest remarks

00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:24.900
and showed her what she needed to do. What an excellent lesson this is for all of us as we try to

00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:34.500
witness to others. Start simple, have a theme in mind and commend the person. What a simple formula.

00:43:35.219 --> 00:43:41.860
I'm sure you'll want to try this approach as soon as possible. When we meditate on the good news,

00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:49.699
we can't help but want to share it at every possible opportunity. We just can't hold back.

00:43:49.699 --> 00:43:54.019
That's the theme of this month's music video.

00:48:05.699 --> 00:48:12.739
Our preaching efforts may help people accept the good news. In turn, they'll be moved to share it

00:48:12.739 --> 00:48:21.139
with others. And what a difference it makes in their lives. Last month, the first episode in the

00:48:21.139 --> 00:48:29.539
new series, imitate their faith, brought to life much of Abraham's story. But what happened next

00:48:29.619 --> 00:48:36.659
in the life of this man, who the Bible refers to as the father of all those having faith?

00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:47.059
Let's find out in part two. One year ago, Jehovah told Abraham something that seemed impossible.

00:48:47.139 --> 00:49:06.460
His wife Sarah would have a son.

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:39.280
Sarah's miraculous pregnancy and Isaac's birth were proof that Jehovah's word always comes true.

00:49:52.480 --> 00:50:07.730
As the rains came down, there they were, eight souls, safe on the ark. Jehovah protected Noah's family.

00:50:10.019 --> 00:50:21.170
That's why we're alive today. And you know, that's not the only time. There have been many things that

00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:32.670
seem scary, but Jehovah always makes sure his promises come true. Think how he helped to protect

00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:42.260
your mother when Pharaoh wanted to take her as his wife. Think how he sent angels to save a lot.

00:50:45.139 --> 00:50:55.900
Remember, he caused your birth. I'm your father. But Jehovah's your father too. You were part of

00:50:55.900 --> 00:51:05.179
his purposeizing. Hard things are going to happen. But remember, we can always trust Jehovah.

00:51:05.179 --> 00:51:11.260
Because he always keeps his promises. That's right. Remember the promise Jehovah made to our family?

00:51:12.059 --> 00:51:18.860
I will give to you. And to your offspring after you, the land in which you lived is a lasting

00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:43.599
possession. And I will be their God. Come here. Hard things did happen. Even in this spiritual

00:51:43.599 --> 00:52:09.519
housework, this wasn't just a sibling rivalry. Ishmael's abusive behavior had broken Sarah's heart.

00:52:12.909 --> 00:52:27.260
I was that slave girl in her son. Do not be displeased by what Sarah is saying to you.

00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:36.139
About the boy and about your slave girl. Listen to her. For what will be called your offspring

00:52:36.139 --> 00:52:42.940
will be through Isaac. As for the son of the slave girl, I will also make a nation out of him

00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:59.650
because he is your offspring. Though it was hard, Abraham obediently sent Heger and his son Ishmael

00:52:59.650 --> 00:53:32.659
away, trusting that Jehovah had his eyes upon them. Take, please, your son, your only son who

00:53:32.659 --> 00:53:40.019
you so love, Isaac, and travel to the land of Mariah and offer him up there as a burnt offering

00:53:40.019 --> 00:54:45.389
on one of the mountains that I will designate to you. Let's go. In the past, Abraham had asked God

00:54:45.469 --> 00:54:53.150
questions about some of his judgments and decisions. But now, his friendship and trust in Jehovah had

00:54:53.150 --> 00:55:03.010
grown. He didn't ask anything at all. You stay here with the donkey. The boy and I will go over

00:55:03.010 --> 00:55:25.250
there and worship and return to you. Father, yes, my son. Hear the fire and the wood. But where is the

00:55:25.250 --> 00:55:41.090
sheep for the burnt offering? God himself will provide the sheep for the burnt offering, my son.

00:55:41.090 --> 00:58:00.590
Abraham. Abraham. There he is. Do not harm the boy. Do not do anything at all to him.

00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:08.829
For now, I do know that you are God-fearing because you have not withheld your son.

00:58:09.789 --> 00:59:18.139
Your only one from me and by means of your offspring, all nations of the earth will obtain a blessing

00:59:18.139 --> 00:59:29.500
for themselves because you have listened to my voice. Abraham and Sarah and Isaac all knew they could

00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:46.460
have full faith in Jehovah. His promises to them are promises to us. When we immerse ourselves in

00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:53.179
familiar Bible accounts, we gain an even deeper appreciation for their power. And more firmly

00:59:53.179 --> 00:59:59.980
in bed in our hearts, the lessons we learn from them. In this month's postcard, we'll visit our

00:59:59.980 --> 01:00:09.739
brothers in Lesothu, a country in the south of Africa. Lesothu is over 1,000 meters or 3,280 feet above

01:00:09.739 --> 01:00:17.099
sea level, with some of its mountain peaks rising three times as high. The majority of its two

01:00:17.099 --> 01:00:24.460
million people called Lesothu live in rural areas. Many heard animals or farm for a living.

01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:32.139
Weather conditions can change quickly in Lesothu's mountainous terrain, calling for protection from

01:00:32.139 --> 01:00:39.739
sudden cold. So the famous Lesothu blanket comes in quite handy, especially in winter,

01:00:39.739 --> 01:00:46.619
when the mountains are blanketed in snow. Of course, the good news must be spread despite cold

01:00:46.619 --> 01:00:55.019
or heights, as our brothers there have been doing for over 80 years. In 1942, two Lesothu

01:00:55.019 --> 01:01:01.179
witnesses who'd learned the truth in South Africa returned to preach enthusiastically in this

01:01:01.179 --> 01:01:08.940
challenging territory. Nine years later, there were five small congregations with 63 witnesses.

01:01:09.579 --> 01:01:17.500
In the 1960s and 70s, the work continued thanks to the tireless efforts of zealous evangelizers.

01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:29.500
Today, over 3,700 publishers conduct over 4,500 Bible studies each month. Because Lesothu's population

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:36.940
is widely spread across a challenging terrain, our brothers exert themselves to preach wherever

01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:43.260
the people live. Many of our brothers here climb steep paths to get to their meetings,

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:52.300
especially the 78 publishers of the Makutlung congregation who meet in the highest kingdom hall

01:01:52.300 --> 01:02:00.619
in southern Africa. From the heights of Lesothu, the brothers and sisters of the Makutlung

01:02:00.619 --> 01:02:09.099
congregation send you their warmest greetings. From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

01:02:09.099 --> 01:02:18.699
this is J. W. Broadcasting.
