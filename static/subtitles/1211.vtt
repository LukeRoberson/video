00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:12.740
I was born in the city of Gorlovka, in the east of Ukraine.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.899
Thinking about the day I was arrested, I did not think anything like that could happen

00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:19.219
to me.

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:24.859
I was going to a field service meeting, but as I was passing the train station, I was asked

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:30.030
by a military officer to show my documents.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.509
I showed my passport, then suddenly he said, open your bag.

00:00:34.509 --> 00:00:39.270
In the back I had my Bible and watched our magazines.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.789
They arrested me not because my documents were missing.

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:50.539
They simply said, believe it, you are our prisoner, go to the basement.

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:56.140
When I got there, the first thing I did was silently pray to Jehovah.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.179
This strengthened me a lot.

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:06.299
The smell was terrible, dirty, smoky, it's stunk, there was no space.

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.739
Not even if everybody lay on his side.

00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:17.180
Each day we were only given a few pieces of bread and water.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.420
One of the detainees started to incite everyone to escape.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.980
They took him out.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:35.659
And from behind the door we could only hear the sound of the beating and his cries of pain.

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:42.299
When he was let back, he was severely beaten.

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.980
Of course, all became silent and nobody complained anymore.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.099
You could say that they kept us in a state of fear.

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:59.099
One detainee said, I would like to address God, but I don't know how to pray.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:07.810
I volunteered and said, I can pray.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.650
Then I sung some 134.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.250
I preached a little to the detainees and to the guards.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.289
Ten days passed and then I was released.

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:36.490
They gave me my bag and said, you're free now.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:47.590
When they were releasing me, one guard asked me to give him a magazine.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:03:06.400
I felt joy that even the situation I found myself in served for spreading the good news.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.719
A while ago we were discussing politics in social science class.

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:14.199
They teach you how to write the class who we would vote for.

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:20.479
I could see what was coming, so I offered a prayer to Jehovah and then she also stopped at my desk.

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:23.240
I simply answered that I don't vote.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:29.400
That he looked at me all surprised, but didn't really know what to say, so she just carried on.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.129
So I felt very relieved and happy because I said what I needed to say.

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:40.289
But instead of leaving it at that, she came back and asked me why I don't vote.

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:45.969
So I started to explain that governments will never bring lasting peace no matter how sincerely they try.

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:49.689
And that's when I told them about God's kingdom.

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:54.090
Instead of being quiet, my classmate started asking question after question.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.930
So when will God's kingdom come then and what is the kingdom?

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.810
I'd never expected they would ask so many questions and be so interested.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.979
So that was a really nice surprise for me as well.

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:13.419
And I was slightly starting to panic for I wasn't sure what to say and how to explain it all properly.

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:17.579
And all of a sudden the idea came to me to show the video.

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:27.019
So feeling a bit more confident, I told the class that I had a video that would exactly explain what God's kingdom is.

00:04:27.019 --> 00:04:30.980
All the students seemed enthusiastic and wanted to see it.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.620
So I got up and walked to the computer, but it wasn't working.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.699
I was so disappointed for I really have the feeling apparently I didn't know how I found it hard to explain

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:45.220
but the video could and now there was no way to show them.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.660
But some of my classmates didn't give up so easily.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.500
They asked me, isn't there another way we can still watch the video for they had really become interested.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:59.300
So then I came up with the idea to add it to our school's group app for the class and they liked it.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.189
So I did that.

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:09.430
Almost at once I received a reply from a student who wasn't in my social science class asking,

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.589
so when will God's kingdom come then?

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:15.750
So here I am thinking, how should I respond?

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:21.790
When before I could even reply, another girl also not in my social science class answers,

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:27.389
well you should have watched the whole video for then you would have seen that you need to read the good news brochure.

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:32.550
So in the end I didn't have to say or do anything, people were responding for me.

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:36.230
And later on I also heard two girls talking about God's kingdom,

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:43.629
even though I'd never spoken to them about it, nor send them anything, that was pretty special too.

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:46.509
I wouldn't call myself a talkative person.

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:50.629
When in a crowd I prefer to stay in the background and not say too much.

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:54.430
That is why I truly believe that Jehovah gives us courage.

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.509
Because normally I probably would never have stood up, but with Jehovah's help I did.
