00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:09.900
I was raised in the truth and had good spiritual examples in my family that helped me to set goals at a young age.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.900
Progress to baptism in my teen years also started regular pioneering as teenager.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:23.899
But I started hanging around the wrong crowd inside the congregation first and then bad association outside.

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:30.210
Party and heavy drinking live in a double life.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.210
I knew I couldn't continue that and stay at home because my parents were still serving Jehovah faithfully.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:43.210
So I decided to move out and go into the world 100% because I just wanted to have fun.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:51.210
Well, with nothing holding me back, the party and the heavy drinking led to experimenting with drugs, living in a moral lifestyle.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.899
The lifestyle in the world was pretty much work all week to party on the weekend and that's what we did.

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.899
But eventually saw that that was just a vicious cycle.

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:17.500
Eventually things got to the point where I started having money problems, losing work, lost my license at one point, lost my apartment, couldn't pay the rent.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.500
And so I knew this was not the way to true happiness and I was miserable.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.500
I thought back to the time I was the happiest and that's when I was serving Jehovah full time.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:38.500
And I wanted that back. So I poured my heart out to Jehovah in prayer and let him know that I wanted to return to him.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:45.500
I knew from personal experience that if you break a bone such as your arm, you need help, you need to see a doctor.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.500
Only they are qualified to fix it, set the bone right so it can heal.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.500
I knew I had to seek out the elders because they're trained spiritual doctors.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.500
They know how to use the scriptures to help you heal.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.500
So I went to them because I wanted to return to Jehovah.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.500
I didn't even have dress clothes anymore. I'd lost all that.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.500
I just went back to jeans and a t-shirt. My parents didn't even know I was coming, but I showed up at the meeting anyway.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.500
The elders, when I met with them, they were so loving and kind and patient.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.500
I've learned firsthand that Jehovah's discipline is for the best.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.500
Yeah, it's true. It may hurt. It may sting initially.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.500
But if we allow ourselves to be molded and trained by it, it'll always work out for the best.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.500
I'm so glad I made the decision to return to Jehovah.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:46.500
Jehovah, he blessed me with the happiness that I longed for, but a lot more.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.500
The privileges of service I never would have imagined.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.500
And I've experienced through Jehovah's discipline his greatest quality, love.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.500
And I've never been happier.
