00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.059
Nita and I talked about her.

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.620
Part of me felt a bit scared.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.219
Part a bit crazy.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.420
Me knocking on doors.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.730
But I knew this was the right thing to do.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.210
A minister should also be free

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.689
from all non-medical use of addictive

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:37.570
or mind-altering substances.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.170
Non-medical.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.539
But taking something when I'm feeling a little stressed.

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:49.579
Like, maybe, I don't know.

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:51.259
A little weed?

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.780
That's okay, right?

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.780
And it's for the stress.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.780
I guess I didn't quite understand what medical meant.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.780
So we see you during the week.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.780
Yeah, okay.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.780
Thank you, Joey.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.780
Thanks.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.019
We'll be back.

00:01:14.019 --> 00:01:16.019
You can guess what our next few studies were about.

00:01:16.019 --> 00:01:18.019
And you should continue to be made new

00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:21.019
in your dominant mental attitude.

00:01:22.019 --> 00:01:24.019
Knowing it was wrong was easy.

00:01:25.019 --> 00:01:28.780
Figuring out how to cope without it.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:45.500
Wasn't beating it felt impossible.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:02:11.860
We have it deserved to hover felt amazing.
