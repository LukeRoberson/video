00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.359
And I expected more from you.

00:00:03.359 --> 00:00:06.360
Hey Lee, what are you talking about?

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.360
Got a pin.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.359
About my posts.

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:11.359
Are you that lonely?

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:16.879
You've got nothing better to do.

00:00:16.879 --> 00:00:17.879
Hey Lee.

00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:23.750
Please, please.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.750
I don't know what's happening.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.750
Did you talk to Emily about my posts?

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:29.750
Yes, we do.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:30.750
Do you want to sift about me?

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.750
No, why would I look up to you?

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.750
You're supposed to be the mature one

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.750
and you're just like Emily, busy running your mind.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.750
Hey Lee.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.750
Look, I can see you're upset.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:50.719
But trust me, this is a huge misunderstanding.

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:51.719
I love you.

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.719
I would never, ever say anything behind your back.

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:05.939
So please, calm down.

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:13.010
Sometimes I just feel so alone.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.010
Between Nana and work.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:21.659
And then knowing all of you were talking about me.

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.659
I promise, that's not what happened.

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.200
You're just really tired and overwhelmed.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.829
So why don't we just slow things down a little?

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.430
You know, meetings always make me feel better.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.430
Even on my worst days.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.430
Why don't we go inside?

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.430
Clean up a little.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.430
Enjoy the program together.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.430
Then afterwards, we can all talk.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.430
I promise, it'll be okay.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:12.979
I don't know how this happened.

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:18.479
But Haley, I'm sorry.

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:21.479
It hurts me to see you so upset.

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:28.340
You too.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:38.069
First, what you heard was not what I said.

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.069
Well, I thought that's how you felt.

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.800
And even if I got that part wrong,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.800
all this drama...

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.879
Let's stop.

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.879
Come on, girls.

00:02:52.879 --> 00:03:04.780
Haley, come closer.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.780
Love is patient and kind.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:23.150
It's not jealous.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.150
It doesn't become provoked, even when things become difficult.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.060
So what are we going to do?

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:42.360
I just thought that...

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:52.620
No, I'm sorry, Ellie.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.620
I'm sorry.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.419
I shouldn't have judged you so harshly.

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:06.830
I shouldn't have judged you at all.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.830
And I'm sorry for dragging you into this,

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.180
by twisting what you said.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.180
It's okay.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.180
Things happen.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.180
I've been on both ends.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:35.329
I should never have spoken that way to you, Celia.

00:04:35.329 --> 00:04:36.329
To either of you.

00:04:36.329 --> 00:04:48.980
And to none.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.980
I'll call you tomorrow.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:53.379
I wish you could give it a rest.

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:54.379
Sorry?

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:55.379
Oh, nothing.

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:58.170
I'm sorry.

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.170
It's just Emily for the millionth time.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.170
What's the problem, love?

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.170
There's no problem.

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:12.660
It's just difficult to let her back in.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:30.339
Not that simple.

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:34.319
Not that simple.

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:36.319
You want to forgive.

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:38.319
But...

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:43.420
I'll get burned again.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.420
Keep in mind...

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:50.420
A chance to forgive is a chance to imitate Jehovah.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.420
We wouldn't want to miss that opportunity.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:58.819
I never thought about it like that.

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:02.819
Think back to a time when you wanted forgiveness.

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:09.220
When it meant everything.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.500
How did it feel?

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.000
You feel awful.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.689
That you've let everyone down.

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:36.319
They forgive you.

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:48.589
Suddenly everything's okay.

00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:50.839
Emily.

00:07:50.839 --> 00:07:55.079
Sorry I haven't been back to you.

00:07:55.079 --> 00:07:56.079
Plan for tomorrow.

00:07:56.079 --> 00:08:12.949
Give me...

00:08:12.949 --> 00:08:17.740
Especially...

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:18.740
This hat.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.740
Oh, thanks.

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.740
You've given me so many great ideas.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:25.740
Yeah, but you make them...

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.740
I can't believe it.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:36.230
I can't believe it.

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:44.519
A treasure place in Jehovah's house.

00:08:44.519 --> 00:08:54.139
You will help.

00:08:54.139 --> 00:08:56.139
I'm sorry you're asking, Celia.

00:08:56.139 --> 00:09:01.049
But you've been here.

00:09:01.049 --> 00:09:02.049
Oh my goodness.

00:09:02.049 --> 00:09:05.330
She's in love with her own voice.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.330
Ever sitting near her at the hall.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.330
Like she's the only one that can seem.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:10.330
And...

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.330
My first thought.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:13.330
Oh no.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.330
Here we go again.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.330
I've seen this movie before.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.330
You don't think she's showing off?

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.330
Is this just about Emily?

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:25.899
Seems it's all about Haley.

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:29.899
Is there just a little bit of envy in there?

00:09:29.899 --> 00:09:35.059
I've lived it.

00:09:35.059 --> 00:09:40.299
If it's the case of her being more careful

00:09:40.299 --> 00:09:43.299
how she comes across, that's another matter.

00:09:43.299 --> 00:09:46.549
What did she suggest?

00:09:46.549 --> 00:09:49.549
I should tell her that she needs to stop.

00:09:49.549 --> 00:09:51.549
Can you believe that?

00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:53.549
Especially as a pioneer.

00:09:53.549 --> 00:09:55.549
What kind of example is this?

00:09:55.549 --> 00:09:58.549
How quickly it snowballs out of control.

00:09:58.549 --> 00:10:00.549
You are such...

00:10:00.549 --> 00:10:03.500
Hello!

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.500
You've got nothing better to do.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:17.720
How difficult it can be to unravel.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:26.730
I shouldn't have judged you so harshly.

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:28.730
I shouldn't have judged you at all.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:33.730
A chance to forgive is a chance to imitate your hover.

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:37.730
Think back to a time when you wanted forgiveness.

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:50.019
Has anyone ever tried talking to her about her singing?

00:10:50.019 --> 00:10:55.419
You know what I love about Veronica?

00:10:55.419 --> 00:10:59.419
She's probably the most hospitable person I know.

00:10:59.419 --> 00:11:01.419
Always open-house at her place.

00:11:01.419 --> 00:11:03.419
And can she cook?

00:11:03.419 --> 00:11:05.419
Have you tried her curry?

00:11:05.419 --> 00:11:07.419
Yes, I've tried it.

00:11:07.419 --> 00:11:09.419
I really do.

00:11:09.419 --> 00:11:10.419
Yes.
