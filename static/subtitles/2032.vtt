00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:09.359
And in production to the Book of Ruth, the Prophet Samuel is believed to be the writer

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:11.759
of this book.

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.120
The Book of Ruth was completed about 1090 BCE.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.719
The events related cover a period early in the time of the Judges.

00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:27.719
The book takes its name from one of its principal characters, Ruth the Moabitis.

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:34.810
The other main characters are Naomi and Boaz.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:41.049
In Chapter 1, a famine moods a man named Elimilex to take his family from Bethlehem

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:43.929
to the land of Moab.

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:47.049
In Moab, Elimilex dies.

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:53.570
His sons Maulin and Killian marry the Moabite women Ruth and Orpa.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.009
Some ten years later, both sons also die.

00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:05.409
Naomi, in deep despair, decides to return to Bethlehem.

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:11.109
She urges her daughters-in-law to go back to their families.

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:13.989
Orpa returns to her people.

00:01:13.989 --> 00:01:18.829
Ruth, however, sticks loyally to Naomi.

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:25.349
When the two widows arrive at Bethlehem, the barley harvest has just begun.

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:32.109
In Chapter 2, Ruth, by chance, cleans in a field belonging to Boaz, who is related

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:35.629
to Naomi's late husband.

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:42.709
Recognizing Ruth's fine qualities, Boaz tells her to continue cleaning in his fields.

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:48.430
When Ruth later tells Naomi that she had cleaned in the fields of a man named Boaz, Naomi

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.629
says, the man is related to us.

00:01:51.629 --> 00:01:55.310
He is one of our repurchasers.

00:01:55.349 --> 00:02:02.189
In Chapter 3, Naomi instructs Ruth to ask Boaz to act as repurchaser.

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.829
He and Ruth could then raise up offspring for Naomi in order to carry on the family line

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.710
of Elimilex.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.789
Boaz is willing to perform this loving deed, but he tells Ruth that Naomi has a closer

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:20.789
male relative who could repurchase her.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.669
In Chapter 4, Boaz goes to the Bethlehem City Gate, where he meets with the other male

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:31.710
relative, who is referred to as so-and-so.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.870
When the relative, in the presence of ten city elders, learns of his obligations, he declines

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.669
to help.

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:44.990
Boaz then publicly accepts the responsibilities of repurchaser.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:55.460
Boaz now marries Ruth, and they have a son, whom the neighbor women name Obed.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:01.780
Did you know Boaz set a fine example of obedience to Jehovah.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:08.180
He did all in his power to help Naomi and Ruth by applying God's law on repurchase, taking

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.060
no shortcuts.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:18.219
The book concludes, Obed became father to Jesse, and Jesse became father to David.

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:24.969
Who became a king of Israel and an ancestor of the Messiah.

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:31.169
As you read the book of Ruth, see how Jehovah turns tragedy into triumph.

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:35.289
Observe how he rewards those who love and obey him.

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:40.490
And note how the book contributes to the history of David's family line, which produced the

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.090
king of God's kingdom.
