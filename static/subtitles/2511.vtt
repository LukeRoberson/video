00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:08.259
Okay, everybody, let's get ready for the meeting.

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:11.259
I really want to come in. Me too.

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:13.259
Okay, what do you want to say?

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.259
Uh, I don't know that.

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:19.260
Well, you could just say anything that comes to mind.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
Or you can prepare.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
Which do you prefer?

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
This one?

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.079
Or that one?

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:33.079
Of course, your mother loves you.

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.079
So she puts the work into making you something delicious.

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.710
Same with you, because you love Jehovah,

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.710
you want to give him the best.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.710
This is why you must prepare your comment.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.710
What how?

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.710
First, you must use the good ingredients.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.710
Let's prepare a short comment.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.710
Step 1. What is the question?

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.710
Step 2. Find the answer in the paragraph.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.709
Step 3. Make some notes.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:07.709
Step 4. Practice.

00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:10.709
Now you are prepared.

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:13.709
And Sophia, you can comment in your own words.

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:16.709
But what if they don't call on me, Dad?

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:19.709
We will prepare two or three answers, just in case.

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:23.709
What if he doesn't call me for any of them?

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:28.370
I quit.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.370
No, don't quit.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.370
Everyone knows you tried your best.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.370
You, the brothers, and Jehovah.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.370
Ah, something smells good.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.370
You ready for dinner?
