00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:11.140
Earlier in the program, we saw some examples of how young ones are building a future with Jehovah.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:17.140
But what impact are such efforts having on the organization?

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.140
Let's look at one example.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.140
The construction of the New World Headquarters at Warwick, New York.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:35.439
Jehovah's Witnesses built 1.6 million square feet in less than four years.

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:44.439
Of the 27,035 volunteers, 3,247 were between the ages of 19 and 25.

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:52.439
I thought this was a project that was going to need strictly very experienced brothers and sisters.

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:54.439
Early on, I realized I was wrong.

00:00:54.439 --> 00:01:00.439
It was going to take also youthful energy because of the volume of work.

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:04.439
The mix of older and younger ones was really a healthy thing on the Warwick project.

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.439
The older ones brought skill and experience.

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:15.439
The younger ones brought the energy, the muscle and the diligence to stay with hard physical tasks all the way through the project.

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:23.439
Whether it was in the kitchen, the night watch, whether early 5 a.m. starts with the concrete crew at 10 degrees,

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:28.439
their joy and their humility was outstanding to accept any work that needed to be done.

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.439
And a lot of young ones, brothers and sisters, moved into the areas so they could commute.

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:40.439
And they would work day after day tirelessly into the evenings even to have the project ready for the next day.

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.439
Their energy was just astonishing.

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:52.439
Jehovah loves young ones and he's willing to invest in them and train them and make them a part of his organization.

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.439
And I saw that so much.

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.439
We had a lot of young people who offered themselves with technical skills.

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:05.439
But if the humility of these very technically skilled young people didn't match or exceed their abilities,

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:12.439
then really Jehovah couldn't use them and they were willing to adjust and we really saw the benefit.

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:22.439
We knew and they knew that they were building not just a project at Warwick, they were building a spiritual project for Jehovah.

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:25.439
You could see Jehovah spirit operating on them.

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:29.439
You could see them mature so quickly.

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:34.439
These young brothers are the next generation of elders, traveling over seers.

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:39.439
They're to be commended and highly respected for the contribution they made as young men.

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:50.439
They all talk about the effect that their Bethel service has had on their outlook and how they don't want to get caught up in this world and its daily pursuits.

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:56.439
Use the skills you learned here on this project and in Bethel.

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:58.439
You are needed.

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:06.439
Continue to keep your spirituality up and to keep your association at a high level.

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:13.439
The highest quality of life is when as clay we put ourselves in the hands of the great potter Jehovah.

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:23.439
And we say, here I am, send me and I'm fully confident they will have no regrets building their future with Jehovah.
