The wings of an owl enable it to fly in virtual silence.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:13.890
How?

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:19.870
The feathers on the leading edge are serrated.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:25.870
One theory suggests that this helps break up the flow of air, reducing noise.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:32.869
Meanwhile, the trailing edge of the wing has a flexible fringe, further dispersing air flow.

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:38.869
Nearly all remaining sound is then absorbed by the velvet-like feathers on the owl's wings.

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:47.869
Scientists from Cambridge University are developing a coating mimicking this wing structure for use on wind turbines.

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:54.869
Early tests show that the coating significantly increases blade speed and efficiency, while drastically reducing noise.

00:00:54.869 --> 00:01:01.869
In the future, scientists hope similar coatings can be applied to a wide range of applications.

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:09.870
So, what do you think? Did the owl's wing evolve or was it designed?
