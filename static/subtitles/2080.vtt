WEBVTT

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.070
Moving the headquarters is monumental.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.070
It's a historic event, and we can read about history,

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.070
but for us to live at this time, to be a part of it,

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.070
as history is being written, it's so exciting.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.070
I would consider just as significant as the move of the brothers

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.070
from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to the City of Church

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.070
as Brooklyn, and even more significant.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.070
If we look at the history of those taking the lead,

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.070
they've never been sentimental toward material things.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.070
They were willing to move the headquarters from Pennsylvania to New York.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.070
They've been willing to sell buildings, they've been willing to buy buildings.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.070
They're always thinking, well, what's best for Kingdom entrance?

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.070
We're not attached to anything material.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.070
From the very onset, a governing body was unanimous

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.069
after we did a search for properties where we could build headquarters.

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:10.069
This property at Warwick would be the very best of all.

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:13.069
Yes, well, we see Jehovah's direction and a procedure

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:15.069
from the beginning to where we are now.

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:18.069
The way it's come together, the location of the property,

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:20.069
the acquisition of Dexedo.

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:24.069
The governing body is convinced that Jehovah is directing

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:26.069
that the world headquarters be moved to Warwick.

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:39.500
We're absolutely convinced of that.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.500
Well, we are happy to announce that on Wednesday, July 17th,

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.500
the Warwick Planning Board unanimously approved the site plan

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.500
for the new world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.500
We give praise and thanks to Jehovah for this important milestone

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.500
in the relocation of the world headquarters to Warwick, New York,

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.500
your brother's governing body.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:21.819
Well, it's taken an incredible amount of effort and planning

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.819
and hard work to get to the point where we're able to have that historic

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.819
announcement and one in worship that we are now able to start construction

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.819
on the Warwick project.

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.819
When we purchased the property in 2009,

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.819
the buildings that were on it had been abandoned for over 20 years.

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.819
And so they were in disrepair.

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.819
We had to make them safe, we had to make them secure,

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.819
and really get them ready for the organization to use the property

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:46.819
how they wanted.

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.819
The next step was we were able to actually remove the buildings,

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.819
and that set it up for our site plan approval that when we see that,

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.819
we could start right away with construction.

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:02.949
Another important step was getting approval to harvest trees last winter,

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:05.949
a time of year when it is safer for wildlife.

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:10.949
Missing this opportunity could have delayed construction for almost another year.

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:13.949
It not only opened up areas needed for building,

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:17.949
but the 40 truckloads of timber were processed at Walkill

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:20.949
and will be reused as lumber for the project.

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:25.949
To finish Warwick in less than four years, which was our goal,

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:30.949
we decided that construction would need to begin by July 2013.

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:32.949
But as that data approached,

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:35.949
it really didn't seem as if we were going to make it.

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:37.949
We were very concerned.

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:42.949
We were making preparations at the Warwick site to begin operations there in July.

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:45.949
We were inviting brothers in, they were buying plane tickets,

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:49.949
arranging rooming, sketching themselves to arrive.

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:51.949
Yet we did not have site permits,

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:54.949
so we were considering canceling these invitations.

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:57.949
We spent a lot of time praying about it.

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:00.949
We decided we needed to act in faith,

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:03.949
and we were just convinced your hope was going to make it happen.

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:08.949
One of the utility related certifications from the state was being processed,

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:10.949
but it hadn't arrived.

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:15.949
And it was really going to be up to the town to decide if we needed the documents for a site plan approval

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:18.949
or if we could provide it to them later.

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:21.949
While the day of the public hearing, we still hadn't got our paperwork.

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:23.949
So we started making calls to the state.

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:27.949
However, by the end of the day our permits still hadn't been issued.

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:32.949
So we went to the public hearing fully expecting to be turned down.

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:35.949
However, to our surprise within 15 minutes at the start of the meeting,

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:39.949
the town board voted to approve our project.

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:41.949
And when the approval came through,

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:44.949
we knew it was only by your hope of spirit that that happened.

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:57.129
You know, it's not very easy to build 1.6 million square feet surrounded by forest

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:59.129
without impacting that forest,

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:00.129
but that's what we were asked to do.

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:05.129
So that design requirement, as well as the limited infrastructure on the site,

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:11.129
made it necessary to stage out personnel, shops, and material storage someplace else.

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:15.129
And the Tuxedo site was just perfect for that need being just six miles away.

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:19.129
Tuxedo property is really our home base for our construction at Warwick.

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:21.129
We've got all our services here for the family.

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:23.129
We have our kitchen and dining room.

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:25.129
We have our residence rooms. We have our offices.

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:26.129
We have our shop space.

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:30.129
It's really going to help the family be able to have what they need

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:32.129
so they can perform the work down at Warwick.

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:38.129
The Tuxedo buildings needed a complete interior demolition and renovation.

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:41.129
But we needed additional personnel to meet the schedule.

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:43.129
The RBCs assisted.

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:49.129
They sent in large crews up to 600 at a time, Thursdays to Sunday.

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:54.129
Without their support, we would not now be ready to support the Warwick construction.

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:57.129
We're from New York. We're excited to be here.

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:01.129
The variety of people from all different RBCs, it's a great blessing.

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:03.129
I'm from New Jersey.

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:06.129
Being able to help the Bethel family is so satisfying.

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:10.129
I know they work so hard to get ready for us to come every weekend.

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:12.129
We're from North Carolina.

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:15.129
It feels so good to be able to give to Jehovah in this way.

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:19.129
I'm going to tell all of my friends and RBC to try to come and help.

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:23.129
The renovation here at Tuxedo is finishing up right now.

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:25.129
We already have residents living here.

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:28.129
We're already fully occupying the dining room and kitchen.

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:30.129
We're already using so many of the services.

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:35.129
And we look forward to having this fully completed to be supporting our Warwick project.

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:40.129
The United States Branch Committee has given us outstanding support for this project.

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:44.129
One time the U.S. Branch even arranged for the entire plumbing department

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:50.129
to come down from Walkeel for a number of weeks to help us at Tuxedo on a very tight schedule we had.

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:52.129
And that proved very helpful.

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:56.129
We made the schedule and had a wonderful experience together.

00:06:56.129 --> 00:07:00.129
One outstanding example of the support we're getting from the Bethel family

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:04.129
is on one particular evening our buses that were headed back to Brooklyn got delayed.

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:07.129
They didn't get back until nearly nine o'clock.

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:09.129
We had our food service brothers and sisters were there.

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:20.180
Ready to receive them, provide them a hot meal, and that was a big encouragement to us.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:25.180
Doing close to a million and a half square feet of construction in less than four years

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.180
will not be done without Jehovah Spirit.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:35.180
And it will not be done without a huge positive influence from the Bethel family and supporting it.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.180
As a committee, we're relying on both of those.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:41.180
And that's how we approach every day.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:48.180
We have the faith and see the evidence that our faith is being very well supported.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.180
The first building on our site, the Vehicle Maintenance Building,

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:54.180
which will be our field dining room, is under construction.

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:58.180
A year from now, that building and the visitor's parking structure will be complete.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.180
The first residence building will be topped out.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.180
And the other five buildings will be under construction.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:07.180
Jehovah has blessed us to start the work on time.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:12.180
And we're counting on Jehovah to provide the thousands of temporary workers

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:16.180
and RBC volunteers to finish this work on time.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:21.180
To help us find skilled volunteers, we recently met with over 700 brothers

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:25.180
from the 137 RBC's Nationwide.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:29.180
It was an historic meeting, and the response has been overwhelming.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:35.179
When it comes to construction, the project will normally go only as well as the site preparation goes.

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:40.179
And if site works here as any indication, we're off to a really good start.

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:42.179
But there's a lot of planning going on here too.

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:46.179
We've got presently six building overseers. They each have three assistants.

00:08:46.179 --> 00:08:50.179
They're all very busy in the planning of their project,

00:08:50.179 --> 00:08:54.179
awaiting for their permits to be received to get their buildings out of the ground.

00:08:54.179 --> 00:09:00.179
It's the spirituality of the brothers and sisters working on the World Headquarters project

00:09:00.179 --> 00:09:03.179
that is absolutely essential for our success.

00:09:03.179 --> 00:09:07.179
So, whatever you do while you're here and whenever you go back home,

00:09:07.179 --> 00:09:11.179
remember your relationship with Jehovah.

00:09:11.179 --> 00:09:15.179
We're very appreciative of the support and visits of the governing bodies

00:09:15.179 --> 00:09:18.179
of the governing body members to the site.

00:09:18.179 --> 00:09:20.179
It's really been very stimulating.

00:09:20.179 --> 00:09:24.179
It's a shot in the arm to not only us on the committee, but all of the workers.

00:09:24.179 --> 00:09:27.179
It helps us to stay focused spiritually,

00:09:27.179 --> 00:09:31.179
even though we have a very challenging project ahead of us.

00:09:31.179 --> 00:09:34.179
We take a tremendous interest in what you are doing,

00:09:34.179 --> 00:09:38.179
and thank you very, very much for all you do.

00:09:38.179 --> 00:09:46.240
We'll be able to come here and work on the World Headquarters.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.240
I would have never thought that would have been something I would have been able to do.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:55.240
But to be up here and then be with my wife is pretty incredible.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:10:00.240
What makes this Warwick project so special to me is why we're doing it

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.240
and who we're doing it for, all for Jehovah's praise.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.240
I think I was really overwhelmed with the beauty of the place,

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:13.240
and it made me think how much the family is going to love living at Warwick.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.240
Even people who are die hard city people,

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.240
I think are going to love when they finally arrive at Warwick,

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.240
because it is just so beautiful.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.240
We have been encouraged as a governing body with the progress at Warwick.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.240
There's just no doubt about it.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:34.240
It makes us kind of think of what life will be like once the end of this system of things occurs,

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:39.240
and there have to be building work done all over the world.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.240
And it's going to be done by servants of the true God, Jehovah.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.240
It's always encouraging to me to go up and see the progress made,

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:48.240
but especially encouraging to be with the brothers up there in the spirit they show,

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.240
the attitude they have.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.240
They have such a wonderful spirit for the work.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.240
They're working hard, they're tired, the long hours,

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.240
but they're devoted to it.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.240
We just get this job done, and it rubs off on you.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.240
When I'm with them, working with them, seeing with them,

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:04.240
I have the urge to get the tools myself to go to work.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:08.240
Fortunately, the urge doesn't last too long.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.240
There's no doubt about it.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.240
There's a lot of work yet to be done.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.240
Our project is just now getting into full swing,

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:22.240
but we're confident that the dear Bethel family will be up to the task

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.240
that you will rise the occasion.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.240
You will do what is necessary to get this work done.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:32.240
And we're confident that the volunteers coming in to help us,

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.240
that they will rise to the occasion.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:38.240
And with your whole of the spirit, we'll all work together unitedly

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:43.240
and we will get done what your whole of the wants accomplished.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:48.240
Love these RBC brothers and sisters coming in doing a great job

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:53.240
and the temporary workers, commuters and the regular Bethelites.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:58.240
We just deeply appreciate the hard work and all the effort they're showing.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.240
It just warms our heart.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.240
We love this family.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:06.240
We love every element of it.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:10.240
The brothers are Patterson, Walkill, Warwick, Tuxedo, Brooklyn.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.240
Everyone is pulling together on this project.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.240
And that's what we love.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.240
The fact that everyone is putting one hundred percent into this

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:22.240
to accomplish this purpose of Jehovah to move the World Headquarters.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:29.240
And we're so excited to be a part of it and to see that the brothers are with us in this move.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:33.240
Well, once this is finally finished,

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:37.240
we're excited to welcome the brothers from around the world to come visit

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.240
because we have some very nice surprises for you.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.240
Not just a beautiful surrounding,

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:47.240
but some real spiritual treasures that you're going to enjoy when you get there.
