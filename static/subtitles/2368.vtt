00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:15.460
Daily, millions of ants travel from their nest to their hunting grounds with nearly no congestion.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.379
How?

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:24.379
When army ants leave their nest, they navigate around those returning with food,

00:00:24.379 --> 00:00:29.379
instinctively adjusting to the returning ants' limited maneuverability.

00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:33.380
When leaf cutter ants encounter slow-moving, load-carrying members,

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:39.380
they adapt by reducing speed, forming clusters, and moving as a collective group.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.380
Researchers say that this actually helps ants reach their destination quicker,

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.380
as they will have the right of way and avoid head-on collisions with ants coming out of the nest.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.380
Additionally, ants can communicate by touching and tenning,

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.380
enabling them to overcome even more complex navigational problems.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:08.099
In contrast, billions of hours each year are wasted when individuals find themselves locked in traffic.

00:01:08.099 --> 00:01:13.099
Scientists hope to mimic the ants' instinctive adaptability by designing traffic systems

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:18.099
that optimize vehicle flow through changing road conditions.

00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:24.099
What do you think? Did the ants' ability to avoid congestion come about by evolution?

00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:27.099
Or was it designed?
