00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:15.500
On June 26th, 2019, in Kaluga, Russia, mass searches were carried out in the homes of

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.100
peaceful believers. Two of Jehovah's Witnesses, Roman Maknov and Dmitri Kuzin, were arrested

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.100
simply because of their religion.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:30.100
I heard a commotion on the street. When I went out, I saw two masked men in the courtyard.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:36.100
I took the keys for the gate and opened the door. Several more men were there. My daughter came out,

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:43.100
she was barefoot, and they made her stand next to me on the courtyard flagstown. It was drizzling.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.100
I asked the let the child put shoes on. He said, later.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:57.100
The believer, Roman Maknov, was handcuffed, even though in no way was he ever aggressive or disorderly.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:04.099
At the same time, another group of security forces burst into Dmitri and Svetlana Kuzin's apartment.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:11.099
I was hearing this room at home, watering my plants, and I heard my husband unlocking the door.

00:01:11.099 --> 00:01:17.099
I went out of the room and saw a bunch of people. My husband had obviously been knocked face

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:23.099
first to the child floor as he came in. His hands were handcuffed behind his back.

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:30.099
Yet another group of armed law enforcement officers raided the home of 87-year-old Olga Virovkinna.

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:39.099
There was a full-swat team in camouflage. No warrant was shown. They demanded, get up.

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:47.099
I said, I can't, I'm in firm. My blood pressure went up to 200 over 115.

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:54.099
According to the believers, during the searches, publications from the federal list of extremist materials were planted in their homes

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:57.099
and their rights were violated.

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:03.099
I heard Dasha scream, this was not in my room, explain to me how it got here.

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:07.099
And I heard my husband's voice saying, this was planted.

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:11.099
Just that afternoon, I was vacuuming under the bed, and there was nothing there.

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:19.099
No one identified himself, no documents were shown. The search began at 9 in the evening,

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:24.099
and lasted until about 430 in the morning.

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:34.099
But for camouflage security forces to burst in on old, infirm people, that's unbelievable.

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:45.099
It's quite interesting. In order to deal with an elderly woman, our law enforcement officers come in mass, wearing masks and carrying weapons,

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:51.099
what cowards, and these people claim that they are actually fighting extremism.

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:57.099
After the searches, Roman Makhnyov and Dmitri Kuzin were taken to the FSB building.

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:04.099
When Papa was taken away, the only thing I managed to whisper to him was that I was proud of his integrity.

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:08.099
And then they took him away, and I felt sad.

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:15.349
I was scared.

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:23.349
When they brought Roman to the FSB building, he was handcuffed to a radiator in some sort of utility room

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:28.349
and was kept like this until he was called for questioning in the morning.

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:35.349
It is noteworthy that several hours earlier, during the searches, an ambulance was called for Roman Makhnyov.

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:42.349
Roman became very ill. Dasha started to scream. The FSB called an ambulance, and it came quickly enough.

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:50.349
He was given medication and then he felt better. Roman was arrested on the 26th, and they didn't feed him until the 29th.

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:57.349
Roman Makhnyov was given no food for three days. They said, well, he could eat whatever he brought with him.

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:03.349
Interesting. I have filed complaints with various agencies.

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:14.620
On June 28th, two days after their arrest, the Kaluski District Court sent Roman Makhnyov and Dmitri Kuzin to a detention center.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:25.279
I hope that people will realize that my dad is not guilty of anything, and he is not a criminal.

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:30.279
Therefore, I hope that soon he'll be back, and we will be together again.

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:36.279
The believers do not agree with the charges, and they intend to seek justice.

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:44.279
I don't know if we'll be able to, but I'm determined to fight to the end to help my husband to support him.

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:59.279
I very much hope that common sense will prevail, and that the authorities will finally realize that we do not present a threat to society, much less to the state.
