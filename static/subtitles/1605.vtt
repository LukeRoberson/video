00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:23.350
The 2023 Regional Convention of Jehovah's Witnesses featured the two-part modern-day drama

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.870
commit your way to Jehovah.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:31.109
Based on real events, this presentation was designed to strengthen our faith and build

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.579
confidence in Jehovah.

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.579
According to the United Nations, by the end of 2022, about 108 million people were living

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.219
as forcibly displaced persons worldwide.

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:51.820
This is 20 million people more than the previous year.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:01:00.609
Our brothers and sisters are by no means immune to this crisis.

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:07.010
Civil unrest, warfare, natural disasters, and other trials test our trust in Jehovah's

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.010
way of sustaining his people.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:18.810
Proverbs 163 tells us, commit to Jehovah, whatever you do, and your plans will succeed.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.530
Thousands of thousands of our brothers and sisters have been displaced from their homes

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.689
or live in refugee camps.

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:31.569
Through the respective branch committees, the governing body assures that the basic needs

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:34.849
of displaced ones are cared for.

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:40.290
Of course, priority is given to such spiritual activities as preaching, meeting together,

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.969
and shepherding.

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:47.890
Jehovah prepares his people to endure uncertainty with patience by depicting real-life scenarios

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.849
of what has happened and continues to happen in many nations.

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:57.569
Although the heartbreak and pain associated with living as a refugee cannot completely

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:02.489
be captured by video, the teaching committee directed audio video services to produce

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:06.569
a feature-length modern-day drama set in Africa.

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:12.289
This video presents practical lessons that will help prepare us for future events as we

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:15.210
approach the Great Tribulation.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.449
During the development phase of the video, interviews with numerous brothers and sisters

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:23.530
who have been refugees helped to refine the script.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.129
Additional consultants from Africa helped to keep the account authentic.

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.969
Then came COVID-19.

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:37.409
In early 2020, the impact of COVID-19 was still unknown.

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:42.009
Initially, it was felt their production in South Africa could still occur.

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:47.169
However, when COVID-19 became a pandemic, the teaching committee determined that the

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:54.930
project had to be filmed in the United States, filming needed to start by May 2021.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.770
This meant that a lot of the preliminary preparation had to be drastically changed or

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.800
completely abandoned.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.800
Since so much of the story was to take place outdoors, could locations in New York State

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.879
pass for Africa?

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:12.919
Would it be believable?

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:17.000
At first, only Patterson Bethel would be used for site locations.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.800
Later, Wal-Kill Bethel provided locations for the project.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.360
Casting selection by audio video services was done remotely.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.159
Perspective cast members received written and video instructions to record their own audition.

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:38.039
These self-guided auditions proved invaluable.

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:43.639
These brothers and sisters from outside of Bethel showed a self-sacrificing spirit.

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:50.280
They willingly made extra adjustments to promote a safe, peaceful and joyful production environment.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.199
While some of the cast could continue their secular work in schooling remotely, others put

00:03:55.199 --> 00:04:03.120
their lives on hold, leaving their jobs for the entire filming period.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:09.199
During production, the team followed COVID-19 protocols in line with local authorities.

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:14.639
As circumstances and protocols changed, the team adapted.

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.120
Many Bethel family members were used in the cast.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:24.399
These included some who were born in Africa and had even experienced life as refugees.

00:04:24.399 --> 00:04:30.480
The time to develop computer-generated 3D sets to depict Africa had long passed.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.720
Given the circumstances, the support from Africa would continue throughout production to

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.920
foster authenticity.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.970
Their help proved invaluable.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:47.129
The Patterson team collaborated with South Africa regarding casting, prop design, set construction,

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:49.449
locations and wardrobe.

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:54.810
For example, certain fabric patterns could denote a particular religion or even political

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.290
affiliation.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.569
So these had to be avoided in production.

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:03.170
The message of the video needed to reach all viewers.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:07.529
Therefore, we did not depict specific regions in Africa.

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:18.850
So care was given not to draw too much attention to a specific nation, tribe, people or language.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.329
The set for the refugee camp proved to be realistic.

00:05:22.329 --> 00:05:26.769
Some in the community around Patterson Bethel believed there had been an actual refugee

00:05:26.769 --> 00:05:28.449
camp established.

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:33.850
The local news media and local government officials responded to assure the public that a video

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.009
project by Jehovah's Witnesses had been approved.

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:42.490
And they clarified that what could be seen from the road was not a refugee camp.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.370
This highlighted just how realistic the set was.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:52.810
Well-rehearsed camera movement, along with specific props based on collaborative research,

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:59.569
would help the northeastern United States pass for some regions found in Africa.

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:04.970
After filming, Bethel family members from Congo, Kinshasa helped produce a musical score

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:11.050
and sound design that enabled the viewer to settle into this story of faith in Jehovah

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:35.069
during trying times.

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:41.750
The objective of every project of Jehovah's organization is to praise our great God.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:47.389
Regardless of the project, whether video, translation, construction or anything else,

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:53.110
we need peace and harmony to receive Jehovah's spirit and to accomplish his work.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:59.069
This requires trusting our brothers and sisters, being open to new ideas, and encouraging

00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:01.910
a free flow of communication.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:07.670
For this video, no one single group had all the answers or solutions.

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:11.350
Ultimately, Jehovah made it a success.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:18.230
Jesus said at Matthew 19 verse 26, with men, this is impossible.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:22.269
But with God, all things are possible.

00:07:22.269 --> 00:07:27.629
The production of this video was truly an object lesson for all of us.

00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:33.910
When we commit to Jehovah, whatever we do, our plans will certainly succeed.

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:39.269
Although we live in trouble sometimes, with Jehovah's support, we can face the future with

00:07:39.269 --> 00:07:40.189
confidence.
