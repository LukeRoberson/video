00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:09.419
It has been said that without writing a single line, Jesus set more pens in motion than any other man.

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:18.420
Of all those pen men, none are better known than Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:28.420
In this video series, we will journey through time to see some of the earliest known manuscripts that contain their work

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.420
and precious fragments of manuscripts that came before.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.420
Have their gospel accounts been transmitted accurately down to our day?

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.420
Do they truly bear evidence that their writers were guided by the Holy Spirit?

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.420
Travel with us to find out.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:58.420
In the late 1800s, archaeologist Sperner Grandfell and Arthur Hunt went to Egypt in search of ancient Christian documents.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:11.420
Soon, under the centuries' worth of rubbish near the town of Oksarinkus, they struck gold in the form of documents written on papyrus, an ancient form of paper.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:20.420
At the time they discovered it, this single leaf was part of the oldest known copy of Matthew.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:29.420
At the top, it bears the words of Matthew 1 verse 1, the book of the history of Jesus Christ.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.420
This fragment was the earliest witness to the greatest man who ever walked the earth.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:54.420
In the years that followed, Grandfell and Hunt collected some 500,000 fragments at Oksarinkus, many of which are biblical and now reside right here in Oxford.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.420
Amongst them, other fragments from Matthew.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:16.500
Analyzing and understanding these manuscripts and scraps became known as paparology, deciphering letters and words, putting the pieces together, painstaking work, like doing a fragile jigsaw puzzle.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:27.500
To keep track of significant Greek scripture papyrae, referencing systems were developed, typically a number preceded by the letter P for papyrus.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.500
So for example, this is P77.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.500
It's in two pieces, but they're from the very same page.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.500
This one is P70.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:53.500
It contains portions of 16 verses, including the earliest record of Jesus' prophecy that the good news of the kingdom would be preached in all the inhabited earth.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:01.500
P77 and P70 are just two of many fragments that Grandfell and Hunt unearthed.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:09.849
There finds a loan contained portions from 13 different chapters of Matthew.

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:17.849
It stirs the imagination to think that these were written and in use perhaps 17, 1800 years ago.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:31.300
But there is one more important piece of the jigsaw to be found here in Oxford.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:43.300
The old library at Modeling College is home to about 20,000 rare books, but its oldest item predates them all by over a millennium.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:54.969
P64, dated to around 200 CE, is now regarded as one of the earliest known Matthew fragments.

00:03:54.969 --> 00:04:02.969
The writing on the front and back shows that they were originally part of a codex or early book.

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:11.969
Some have only a few words left intact, but even the tiniest of puzzle pieces can help form a faith strengthening picture.

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:22.970
P64 contains evidence of one of Matthew's most distinguishable traits, highlighting the fulfillment of Hebrew scripture prophecies.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:38.379
In this case, Zechariah's prophecy about the price for Jesus' betrayal, 30 pieces of silver, a detailed unique to Matthew's account, and not to be missed by a former text collector.

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:52.379
Scholars who have examined these texts attest to the close continuity of meaning between these earliest fragments and later manuscripts which form the basis for our translation today.

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:58.459
They say one man's rubbish is another man's treasure.

00:04:58.459 --> 00:05:03.459
That was true for Grenfell, Hunt and others who excavated in Egypt.

00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:10.459
Thanks to their work, the drifting sands of time that once buried these fragments have been brushed away.

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:18.459
All of this gives us confidence that the text of Matthew remains essentially unchanged.

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:29.860
Credit for that can only go to Jehovah.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:38.860
The Gospel of Mark is an action-packed account, recalling at least 19 of Jesus' recorded miracles.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:50.860
Although only two early fragments are known to have survived, the most significant one, P45, features portions of 12 of those miracles.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:58.860
No wonder the very first verse of this Gospel declares its theme to be the good news about Jesus.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.860
It's the perfect opening line.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:06.860
When it comes to the book's conclusion, however, there has been some controversy.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.860
In fact, three different versions of it have circulated for centuries.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.860
How can we know which one to trust?

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.860
The earliest Bible manuscripts can help.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.860
Casually wrapped in paper, the Codex Saniaticus is on its way to the British Museum.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:30.860
The Codex Saniaticus is the earliest manuscript that preserves the entire Greek scriptures.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:37.860
It was the work of at least three trained scribes in the fourth century, who based their work on earlier texts.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.860
You're doing it.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.860
Accumulated through the centuries behind the walls of the Vatican Library,

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.860
the Codex Vaticanus is also dated to the fourth century.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:56.860
And although a few portions have been lost over time, the Gospels remain completely intact,

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:03.860
these priceless manuscripts are regarded as key sources by modern Bible translators.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:12.860
And here at our Bethel Museum in Britain, we are going to take a look at two exactly similar editions.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:18.860
These codices were written on parchment, the skin of calves or goats or sheep.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:26.860
Around 360 animals would have been needed to produce the Codex Saniaticus alone, a very expensive endeavor.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:33.860
But it was clearly worth it, as parchment typically lasted longer than papyrus.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:39.860
These manuscripts provide context, which is lacking in papyrus fragments.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.860
And because they were completed as early as the middle of the fourth century,

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:47.860
they have greater authority than later manuscripts.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:53.860
All of this is helpful when considering how Mark's Gospel ends.

00:07:53.860 --> 00:08:11.120
In the New World translation, Mark's Gospel ends at chapter 16 verse 8,

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:18.120
where we are told that after visiting Jesus' tomb, the women fled, trembling and overwhelmed with emotion,

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:22.120
and they said nothing to anyone, for they were in fear.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:29.120
Unlike the other Gospels, Mark doesn't report on any post-resurrection encounters with Jesus.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:33.120
The closest we get to him is an empty tomb.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:41.120
Some later readers evidently felt that this conclusion lacked enough closure to have been the original.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:51.120
From the fifth century onwards, manuscripts appeared with alternative conclusions, some with two additional verses, and others with twelve.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:56.120
What about the Codex Vaticanus? Let's see for ourselves.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:13.100
Here, the original Greek has been translated, and going out, they fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had seized them,

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:17.100
and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:25.100
Below that, the ancient ink states, according to Mark, indicating the end of the book.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:29.100
The Codex Sanaticus also concludes this way.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:44.620
Together, these two pillars provide strong support for verse 8 as the original ending penned by Mark.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:54.620
Thanks to the survival of precious manuscripts like these, we can be confident that we have the complete text of Mark's Gospel.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:58.620
So why the seemingly abrupt ending?

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:04.620
While the Gospel writers each had their own style, and simply put, Mark's was brevity.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:13.620
Guided by the Holy Spirit, Mark's concise style produced the shortest yet most dynamic portrayal of Jesus,

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:30.100
as a man of action, a man of miracles, and a man of true compassion.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:36.100
Luke, known to early Christians as the beloved physician,

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:47.100
P-75, dated to around 200 CE, preserves an account unique to Luke's Gospel, one which no physician could ignore,

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:52.100
Jesus bringing a widow's son back to life at name.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:11:00.100
This fragment is therefore the earliest testimony to Jesus' earliest recorded resurrection.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:06.100
The emergence of P-75 in the late 1950s was significant.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:14.100
The large number of pages that had survived allowed for a comprehensive comparison with the later Codex Vaticanus.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:18.100
The two were found to be nearly identical.

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:25.100
So the text of this Gospel has been accurately transmitted down to our day and is trustworthy.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:30.100
But is the information on these pages equally trustworthy?

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:34.100
Actually, a single sentence reveals the answer.

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:46.480
At the beginning of chapter 3, Luke records a list of officials in authority when John the Baptist began to preach.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:57.480
Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate, Herod, Philip, Lyceneus, as well as Annus and Caeophus, seven in total.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:03.480
Now Luke's Gospel, as stated at its outset, is fact, not fiction.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:08.480
So there should be historical evidence of these officials and of when they ruled.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.480
So what does history say?

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:22.480
Tiberius Caesar, second emperor of Rome, well attested to in literature and archaeology, as we would expect.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:29.480
Next, Herod Antipas, son of Herod the Great, and district ruler of Galilee.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:35.480
Among other evidence, inscriptions bearing his name, as well as Cointy commissioned, have been found.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:44.480
Philip, his half-brother, confirmed by historians to be the tetrarke or territorial prince under Tiberius.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:13:00.049
Former high priest Annus and his son-in-law, Caeophus, both are noted by ancient historians and are also associated with this family tomb by many modern historians.

00:13:00.049 --> 00:13:06.049
Confirmation of five of the seven officials isn't bad, but what about Pontius Pilate?

00:13:06.049 --> 00:13:13.049
He's called Pilate many times by the other Gospel writers, but only ever Pontius Pilate by Luke.

00:13:13.049 --> 00:13:19.049
And what about Lyseneus, whom Luke linked to Abelini, a rather insignificant territory?

00:13:19.049 --> 00:13:28.049
Now, it should be mentioned that the Roman Empire's preference was to leave local government in place in their conquered territories.

00:13:29.049 --> 00:13:37.049
As a result, those in authority could be referred to in different ways by a Roman title or by a local one.

00:13:37.049 --> 00:13:46.049
This created a potential for error, so much so that some historians might have played it safe, not daring to go to Luke's level of detail.

00:13:46.049 --> 00:13:53.049
Had his strength become his weakness, would five relationships not have suffice?

00:13:53.049 --> 00:14:03.049
For centuries, Pilate and Lyseneus existence was questioned, but then archaeology brought to light these stone inscriptions.

00:14:03.049 --> 00:14:08.049
Confirmation of both rulers' existence and when they ruled.

00:14:08.049 --> 00:14:19.389
Seven officials, seven overlapping reigns, all tied together in time by means of just one sentence.

00:14:19.389 --> 00:14:26.389
This is authentic history, but what does this mean for us?

00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:38.389
By setting his narrative in the context of Tiberius Caesar's 15th year in power, Luke pinpoints the start of John's ministry to 29 CE.

00:14:39.389 --> 00:14:49.389
As a result, the date of Jesus' baptism, his appearance when he became the Christ, a far superior ruler, is in a sense written in stone.

00:14:49.389 --> 00:15:02.860
Luke was moved by the Holy Spirit to trace all things with accuracy, no wonder one scholar called him a historian of the highest order.

00:15:10.549 --> 00:15:18.549
John, the last gospel to be written, yet this account takes his father back in time than any other.

00:15:18.549 --> 00:15:23.549
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God.

00:15:23.549 --> 00:15:38.220
P66 and P75 preserve those words, the earliest record of the earliest moments of Jesus' pre-human existence.

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:44.220
John's religious opposes viewed him as uneducated and ordinary.

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:48.220
His vocabulary was smaller than most other writers of the Greek scriptures.

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:56.220
Yet his use of simple words and simple sentences helps us grasp the most profound truths.

00:15:56.220 --> 00:16:01.220
One word that stands out is the Greek word often rendered truth.

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:07.220
It appears three times as often in this gospel than all the others combined.

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:14.220
Yet the truthfulness of this gospel has itself been challenged.

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:24.220
Between John 753 and 811, some ancient manuscripts include an account about Jesus sparing an immoral woman.

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:26.220
Others do not.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:31.220
So does this account belong in the inspired record penned by John?

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:35.220
Or did someone else take it upon themselves to add it later?

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:40.850
What do the earliest witnesses say?

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:45.850
Codex BZ from the 5th century includes the account.

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:54.850
But Codex Ephraim and Codex Alexandrinus are both missing this page of John completely.

00:16:54.850 --> 00:17:05.849
Yet, careful measurement by scholars indicates that these codices would not have had enough space on the missing pages to include the account.

00:17:05.849 --> 00:17:15.849
The earliest and most authoritative manuscripts, Codex Anaticus and Codex Vaticanus, do not include this passage.

00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:20.849
What about the earlier fragments, P66 and P75?

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:28.849
Although the pages of chapter 7 and chapter 8 survive, they bear no trace of the account at all.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:51.400
So the verdict is clear, the account of the immoral woman is spurious, meaning it was added centuries after John completed his gospel.

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:59.400
Now it seems clear that the further back in time we travel, the closer we get to the original words of truth.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:03.400
But there is one more stop that we do not want to miss.

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:11.400
So we've come to the John Rylands Library in Manchester, known locally as the Cathedral of Books.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:31.740
This is Papyrus 52, dated by some scholars to around 125 CE.

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:36.740
It's a fragment of the oldest copy of John.

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:43.740
In fact, it's the oldest fragment of the Christian Greek scriptures that has ever been found.

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:51.859
What does it contain? Another simple yet profound sentence.

00:18:51.859 --> 00:19:03.789
For this I have been born and for this I have come into the world that I should bear witness to the truth.

00:19:03.789 --> 00:19:09.789
P52's early date testifies to how quickly John's gospel spread.

00:19:09.789 --> 00:19:22.789
By about 170 CE, his account was combined with Matthew, Mark and Luke in the work commonly called the Diatessaron, a Greek word meaning through the four.

00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:39.950
This work testifies that before the end of the second century, these four inspired accounts alone were regarded as the definitive account of Jesus' life.

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:52.839
In John's last verse, he tells us that if all other things Jesus did were written in detail, the world itself could not contain the scrolls.

00:19:52.839 --> 00:19:57.839
Walking through a room like this, you feel the weight of those words.

00:19:57.839 --> 00:20:09.839
We can't help but be in awe of what Jehovah has accomplished by using his Holy Spirit to guide the gospel writers and by preserving their accounts.

00:20:09.839 --> 00:20:16.839
He has left us with a remarkably trustworthy and intimate portrayal of his son.

00:20:16.839 --> 00:20:23.839
More than any other book in the world, these four, along with the rest of the Bible,

00:20:23.839 --> 00:20:29.839
convinces that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God.
