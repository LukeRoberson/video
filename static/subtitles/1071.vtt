00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:04.660
What would we do without forest?

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.259
Forests help to sustain our supply of fresh water.

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:16.899
They purify the air, and forests convert carbon dioxide into life-sustaining oxygen.

00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:22.219
Yes, forests are vital to our existence.

00:00:22.219 --> 00:00:27.859
Yet scientists warn that we're in danger of losing this precious resource.

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:34.259
This causes some people to wonder whether God cares about what's happening to the forest.

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:44.659
We may even ask, will the loss of forest affect God's ability to fulfill His promise to make the earth a paradise?

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:50.140
The simple answer to that question is absolutely not.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.420
Jehovah has everything under control.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.700
Please watch the following video.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:06.280
It will strengthen your faith in the designer of the forest.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:19.379
Trees can grow very strong and withstand powerful forces.

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:22.819
But if they didn't decompose after they die,

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:28.340
trees and leaves would pile up with their nutrients locked away inside.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.180
Yet they do decompose.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.489
How?

00:01:34.489 --> 00:01:40.790
Most animals cannot eat fallen wood and leaves.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:50.879
But fungi can, they break down the dead plant tissues, making them softer.

00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:59.319
Beetles and termites bore through the wood exposing more surface area and spreading the fungi inside.

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:06.299
Which soften it further so that other insects can enjoy the feast.

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:17.659
Earthworms aerate the soil and pull nutrients down where they can be used by other plants.

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:25.379
Most decomposes have been called the unsung heroes of the natural world.

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:33.500
They recycle organic matter so that it is available to support new life.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.900
Through this process, Jehovah made it possible for us to enjoy earth's lush beauty.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.949
Generation after generation.

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:48.710
Let the fields and everything in them rejoice.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:58.889
At the same time that all the trees of the forest shout joyfully.

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:00.490
Amazing!

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.409
Will you ever look at a forest in the same way again?

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:12.490
Think about what the decomposition and recycling of organic matter means for us and our future.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:19.569
Those beetles, termites and earthworms, the unsung heroes of the natural world

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.849
will keep on doing their job throughout eternity.

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.009
Reflect for a moment.

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:33.490
If Jehovah had the wisdom to create forests that can replenish themselves,

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:40.849
surely he knows how to undo the damage that man has done to the earth.

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:45.569
Jehovah hasn't revealed all the details of how he's going to restore the earth,

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:52.610
but we can be confident that he will fulfill his promise to make all things new.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:58.610
Please open your Bibles to Psalm 37, verses 10, 11 and 29.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:05.090
The scripture contains a promise regarding man and the earth.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:11.650
Psalm 37, verses 10, 11 and 29 reads,

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.169
just a little while longer and the wicked will be no more.

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:19.329
You will look at where they were and they will not be there,

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:27.970
but the meek will possess the earth and they will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:34.529
The righteous will possess the earth and they will live forever on it.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:42.529
How reassuring people who are righteous and meek will be on the earth forever

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:53.009
and that earth will be a paradise, but there are at least two requirements for Jehovah to accomplish this.

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:58.529
He's already taken care of the first requirement, we saw proof of that in the video.

00:04:59.329 --> 00:05:04.610
Jehovah created the forest with an amazing rejuvenation system.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:13.569
So in spite of man's prolonged misuse of the forest, Jehovah has already put in place the mechanism

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:17.490
to undo all the damage that man has done.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:25.889
Doesn't the marvelous design of the forest build your faith in Jehovah's promise of a paradise?

00:05:26.769 --> 00:05:34.449
The second requirement to make the earth a paradise is described in verse 10 of Psalm 37 that we

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:45.009
just read. There it says, and the wicked will be no more. Not only will Jehovah undo the damage

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:49.649
that men have done, but he will also remove the source of the problem.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:56.050
Greedy men who exploit and misuse this precious resource will be gone.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:04.129
Therefore, we have no reason to fear that humans will continue to run the earth until it reaches

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:13.970
the point of no return. Jehovah knows what is going on. Please open your Bibles to Revelation chapter 11

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:21.329
and we'll read verse 18. This scripture assures us that Jehovah cares about our planet because

00:06:21.329 --> 00:06:29.730
it is his planet and it confirms that he is going to hold men accountable for their actions.

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:38.370
Revelation chapter 11 verse 18 says, but the nations became wrathful and your own wrath came

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:44.850
and the appointed time came for the dead to be judged and to reward your slaves the prophets

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:53.649
and the holy ones and those fearing your name the small and the great and to bring to ruin those

00:06:53.649 --> 00:07:03.329
running the earth. Jehovah is not going to let wicked men run his beautiful creation.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:09.810
Nothing can stop Jehovah from carrying out his purpose for the earth.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:17.329
Our examination of the forest has strengthened our faith that Jehovah will accomplish everything

00:07:17.329 --> 00:07:25.089
that he has in mind to do. The words of faithful Job reflect our conviction that that promise

00:07:25.089 --> 00:07:32.449
will come true. As recorded at Job chapter 42 verse 2, Job was moved to declare regarding Jehovah,

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:39.810
now I know that you are able to do all things and that nothing you have in mind to do

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:49.490
is impossible for you. What does Jehovah have in mind to do? One thing is to transform the earth

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:57.250
into a paradise with rich abundant forest. Forests that will continue to help sustain our

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:04.449
supply of fresh water to purify our air and to convert carbon dioxide into oxygen.

00:08:05.649 --> 00:08:12.610
The video that we just watched quoted Psalm 96 verse 12 which declares that the trees of the

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:23.329
forest shout joyfully by their very existence forest praise their creator and we can add our joyful

00:08:23.329 --> 00:08:34.210
shouts of praise to those of the forest. Therefore may we continue to use creation to build our faith

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:42.129
because if we do that we will see the restored life-sustaining forest bring happiness to perfect

00:08:42.129 --> 00:08:51.009
humans and praise to their creator Jehovah forever. Brother Len Myers, a helper to the writing

00:08:51.009 --> 00:08:57.409
committee will now present the next talk of this symposium. Use creation to build your faith,

00:08:57.409 --> 00:09:05.809
wind and water.
