00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:11.289
And in production to the Song of Solomon, also known as Canticles, King Solomon wrote this poetic book in Jerusalem.

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:16.600
It was composed some time after the temple was built.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.600
Of the many songs composed by Solomon, this is considered his greatest.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.600
The main character is the Shulamite girl.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.600
Other characters included in this drama are the Shulamite's brothers, the shepherd,

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:41.600
Solomon, the daughters of Jerusalem or ladies of Solomon's court, and the daughters of Zion or women of Jerusalem.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.600
The Song is presented through a series of conversations in which the speakers are constantly changing.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:56.600
Although the characters speaking are not named, they can be identified by what they say or what is said to them.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.329
The Song of Solomon consists of eight chapters.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:11.329
Chapters 1 and 2 contain events that take place near the town of Shunam, which was also called Shulam.

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:21.329
The Shulamite girl is brought into Solomon's camp, but she resists his advances and declares that she can love only her dear shepherd.

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:31.329
Did you know Shunam was the birthplace of David's nurse Abishag, and the place where the prophet Elijah often stayed with a family.

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:36.329
Chapters 3 to 8 describe events that take place in Jerusalem.

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.329
Solomon returns to his court, taking the Shulamite with him in an effort to impress her.

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:51.329
The Shulamite tells the daughters of Jerusalem or ladies of Solomon's court not to arouse love in her for Solomon.

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:58.329
The shepherd follows the Shulamite to Jerusalem and strengthens her with warm expressions of endearment.

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:09.330
We should keep in mind the ancient eastern setting of this song in order to appreciate the poetic expressions of endearment that may seem unusual today.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:19.330
The shepherd compares the Shulamite's eyes to those of a dove, her hair to a flock of goats, and her cheeks to a segment of pomegranate.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:27.770
Solomon approaches her again with flattering words, but she continues to reject his advances.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.770
In chapter 8, the Shulamite girl returns to her home.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.770
Having proved her exclusive devotion, she is reunited with her dear shepherd.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:48.770
Their unfailing love is described as the flame of jaw because Jehovah is the originator of true love.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:03:02.770
As you read this book, note the chaseness of the Shulamite girl, her loyalty to the shepherd, and how true love originates with Jehovah, whose sovereignty is based on love.
