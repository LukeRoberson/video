WEBVTT

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.480
We love our conventions and assemblies.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.280
We praise Jehovah and feed at his table

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.780
with hundreds of our brothers and sisters.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.480
Many of our brothers and sisters

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.480
in rural areas of Africa

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.480
attend assemblies and conventions

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.579
in open-air meeting places.

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.579
Sadly, at times the conditions are not favorable,

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.280
making it difficult to fully benefit

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.479
from the spiritual food.

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.579
But at Isaiah 49-15,

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.179
Jehovah says,

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:48.479
can a woman forget her nursing child

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:52.380
or have no compassion for the son of her womb?

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.880
Even if these women forget,

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.979
I would never forget you.

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:01.280
Jehovah has shown his love to our brothers and sisters

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.379
in Africa in a special way.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.579
How is this done?

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:08.079
What were the challenges

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:11.180
that made this situation so dire?

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.980
One of the challenges the brothers have to face

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.680
is the distance that they have to travel

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.680
to get to the assembly hall.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.680
In some parts of the country

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.280
there is no reliable transportation.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.680
So the brothers either have to hire a truck

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.180
or they have to use a bicycle.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.079
And in some cases,

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:31.079
they even have to work long distances,

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.280
sometimes even between four to six hours.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.680
It was a huge challenge to attend a regional convention.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.379
First, we started saving up ahead of time

00:01:42.379 --> 00:01:44.180
to get the money for transportation

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.980
and lunch for the three days of the convention.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.180
But if we could not find the money,

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.980
we would go by foot carrying chairs on our heads

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.409
and food in our hands.

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.310
And sometimes after arriving,

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.209
you were so tired.

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:03.810
You could not concentrate on what the brothers were teaching

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.609
because you were sweating and incredibly tired.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.110
When the brothers and sisters

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.009
attend outdoor assemblies,

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:15.509
they are exposed to a number of challenges.

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:16.909
During the rainy season,

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:18.409
when there is a big storm,

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:22.210
it can completely stop the program for a while.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:23.909
Sometimes when it rained,

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:27.310
everyone had to leave their spot to hide somewhere.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.710
Imagine you had someone there that you invited,

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.210
and then when the rain started,

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.009
they had to run and hide somewhere.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.759
We were sad and ashamed to invite people.

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:42.860
Many cases the brothers just have to sit on the ground,

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.960
some will sit on small stones or on a mat or piece of cloth

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.060
and they have to bear the heat of the sun

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.360
because there is no proper shade

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.960
or just a simple grass structure over their heads.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.259
These structures did not really protect us

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:02.060
because in the heat we really suffered.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.659
We moved from one place to another.

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:05.960
If the heat followed,

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.259
we would move again to another spot.

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:12.759
The teaching and spiritual instruction suffers.

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:15.060
The brothers and sisters cannot concentrate

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.159
on closely following the program.

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:20.159
To address these challenges,

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:22.759
the publishing committee of the governing body

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:24.659
asked the global purchasing

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:27.659
and regional design construction departments

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:30.360
to work with various branches

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.460
to improve the situation.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.759
The goal was to provide dignified places of worship

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.560
where our brothers and sisters

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.360
could enjoy the spiritual learning environment

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.960
with minimal distractions.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.460
The branches provided the input

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.860
of what the situation exactly was.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.360
They showed some pictures,

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.860
showed what are the challenges

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.360
and in what areas at this moment these assemblies are held.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.460
One of the requirements that they put in there

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.060
was that they wanted to be able to build it up quickly

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.659
and also to de-assemble it quickly

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:10.460
so that it could be moving to another assembly site.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:11.860
With that information,

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.659
we worked with RDC together

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:16.060
to see what is something that fits to that

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.060
in a cost-effective way

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.060
and one option that we had from a supplier,

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.259
a standard hand,

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:27.060
and one was a customized shade structure.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.860
After the approval received from these branches

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.459
and also from the publishing committee,

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:34.860
we started to place the orders

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.860
and work with the branches to get it together

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.560
actually on site.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.560
As these projects were implemented,

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.259
a training program was also started.

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:46.060
Using qualified trainers,

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.060
some local construction servants were trained

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.560
to safely install,

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.360
pack and maintain the tents.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.860
These construction servants

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.259
then trained local congregation publishers to do the same.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.459
The training provider was so effective

00:05:00.459 --> 00:05:01.860
that in some cases,

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.860
tents for an entire venue of 2000 seats

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.459
were put up in just one day.

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:09.660
It's a very simple structure

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.160
with a little shade material over it

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.860
so that the brothers and sisters

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.259
can sit in the shade

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:16.759
or if there's heavy rain,

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:19.660
having a nice place where they can follow the program

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.759
without much destruction

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:23.660
and can really see all the videos

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.759
that the governing body provides at this moment.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.160
Seeing how different departments,

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.360
branches work together,

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.160
the willing and happy spirit of all involved,

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.160
especially the local brothers

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.060
was a clear evidence of Jehovah's blessings on this project.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.560
Truly, this is a special gift from Jehovah.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.759
It is truly encouraging to see

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:49.660
how Jehovah blessed the collaboration

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.560
and hard work of so many.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.660
This loving provision from Jehovah

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.759
has touched the hearts of our brothers and sisters.

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:00.259
What I can say,

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:04.160
what I really feel deep inside on this matter.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.360
When I see what Jehovah has done for us,

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.860
the beautiful assembly site and nice shade,

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.660
when I see brothers and sisters

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.959
say from sun and rain,

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:18.660
I feel that Jehovah has dignified us.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.860
I have seen Jehovah's great love for us.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.259
It is amazing.

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:27.259
Before, we never imagined that we could attend a convention

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:29.160
at a good place like this.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.860
But seeing this provision helps us to understand

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.160
that Jehovah loves us so much.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.660
We are so happy because the place is attractive,

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.459
there are nice places to sit,

00:06:40.459 --> 00:06:43.860
and now we can invite anyone to come attend with us.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.360
We do not need to imagine someone

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.160
we invited having to run and hide if it rains.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.860
We no longer feel ashamed or scared to invite people

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.860
because we know that they can stay

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.060
in their place the whole time.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.759
After all, this place has truly become very beautiful.

00:06:59.959 --> 00:07:02.560
I thank Jehovah so much.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.519
I also thank the governing body

00:07:04.519 --> 00:07:07.660
for helping us get such a beautiful assembly hall.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.160
We do not have to go back and forth

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.860
with chairs on our heads anymore.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.060
We have good seats that allow us to concentrate

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.060
on what Jehovah is teaching us.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.259
Thank you so much, dear brothers.

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:22.259
There is a growing demand for these facilities.

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:27.259
Over 100 more sites in Africa are needed right now.

00:07:27.259 --> 00:07:30.259
It is our privilege to support this initiative

00:07:30.259 --> 00:07:34.259
with our personal prayers and donations.

00:07:34.259 --> 00:07:40.259
For Jehovah, no location is too remote.

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:43.259
He does not forget his people.

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:46.259
He uses his organization to provide

00:07:46.259 --> 00:07:51.259
what they need at the right place and at the right time.
