00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:06.320
Well, today's text comments mention the effect that prejudice had on Jesus' disciples.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:14.320
And as we think about that today, and how we are part of an organization that is much more diverse than in the first century,

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.320
it raises the question,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.320
does prejudice still have an impact on God's people today?

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.820
We're very thankful that we love and serve a God who does not tolerate prejudice.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.320
The Bible states that quite plainly, turn with me pleased to the book of Acts.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.799
And we note the words of the Apostle Peter in Acts chapter 10.

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:45.460
In verse 34, it says that this Peter began to speak, and he said,

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:53.960
Now I truly understand that God is not partial, but in every nation,

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.460
the man who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.959
Now, if you look at the study note, it mentions that the Greek phrase for is not partial.

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:14.459
Literally means is not one who takes faces, and that perfectly describes Jehovah, doesn't it?

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:26.459
He does not favor one face, one individual over another because of their race, nationality, social standing, or any other external factors.

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:30.959
And that's how you and I strive to be as well.

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:36.459
However, we must acknowledge that it is a challenge to be impartial,

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:42.459
largely because in today's world, we are surrounded by prejudice.

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:46.459
So to answer that question, does prejudice have an impact on God's people today?

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:48.459
Indeed it does.

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:50.459
We may be victims of it,

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:54.959
or we ourselves might hold some prejudice.

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:59.959
Interestingly, the watchtower back in 2013 made this comment.

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:05.959
It said, if we are honest with ourselves, we have to admit that deep down,

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:13.960
we all harbor varying degrees of prejudice in one form or another.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:21.960
So if this is something that is a human tendency and we're all plagued with it, at least to some degree,

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.960
then how do we overcome it?

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.960
Well, that might be helpful to start with the word itself.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.960
As Mr. Lighthizer mentioned, the dictionary defines prejudice as a preconceived opinion

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:43.460
that is not based on reason or actual experience, a preconceived opinion.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.960
That has to do with how we think and how we feel.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.960
Thoughts that likely have been shaped by our personal experiences,

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.960
our upbringing and our environment.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.960
And maybe when we think of prejudice, perhaps our minds go to or we focus on racial prejudice,

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.960
hatred or animosity towards someone, we talked a little bit about that last week.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.960
But the watchtower also mentioned that prejudice can also be formed against another person

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:20.960
because of their weight, gender, language, social status, religion,

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.960
or virtually any perceived difference.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:32.960
So if prejudice starts with our personality, our personal preconceived opinions,

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:40.960
then the way to overcome it has to start by elevating our minds to God's way of thinking.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.960
Again, if we go back to the Bible, this time to 1 Samuel 16.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:51.039
Notice how Jehovah brings this to light.

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:56.039
1 Samuel 16, and let's recall what happens when Samuel goes to the House of Jesse

00:03:56.039 --> 00:04:00.039
to appoint one of his sons as king.

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:05.039
Verse 6, it says, as they came in and he saw a light, he said,

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:10.039
surely, here before Jehovah's stance is anointed one,

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:13.039
but Jehovah said to Samuel,

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:20.040
do not pay attention to his appearance and how tall he is before I have rejected him.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.040
Now we stop there a moment. Did you notice what Samuel did?

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.040
In this particular instance, he was as that Greek phrase denoted,

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.040
a taker of faces, wasn't he?

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.040
He looked at Elias, he saw how tall, how handsome he looked,

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.040
surely this must be Jehovah's choice.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.389
But note how the verse continues, note to teaching point,

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:46.389
for the way man sees is not the way God sees,

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:50.389
because mere man sees what appears to the eyes,

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:54.389
but Jehovah sees into the heart.

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:56.389
That's what matters to Jehovah.

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:00.389
What's in our heart? What we are on the inside,

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:07.389
and he's looking for those qualities in each of us that reflect his impartiality.

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:12.389
Now how does this have benefited to us since you and I cannot read hearts?

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:14.389
Well, let's go back to the study note.

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:18.389
The rest of the study note for Acts 1034 gives us the answer,

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:26.389
because it says imitating God's impartiality means not making surface judgments,

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:32.389
but paying attention to the character and quality of others.

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:36.389
Now perhaps one way we can illustrate this is with the example of a geode.

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:40.389
Now you look at this picture on its outside surface,

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:44.389
a geode looks pretty ordinary and nondescript,

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:48.389
no different than any big rock or stone you'd find outside.

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:51.389
But if you break it open,

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:53.389
quite a different story.

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:55.389
Now when you look inside,

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:59.389
you see these beautiful sparkling crystals of varying colors

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:04.389
that are just quite beautiful and really radiant to the eye.

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:07.389
Well, what's our point?

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:10.389
When we make surface judgments,

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:14.389
or preconceived opinions about our brothers,

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:18.389
often aren't we looking at them like the outside of that geode?

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:22.389
All we see is just the external surface.

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:28.389
It isn't so true, perhaps if someone is shy, quiet, or reserved,

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:30.389
it's so easy to label them, isn't it?

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:33.389
We size them up and we quickly come to the conclusion now,

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:35.389
you know what, that's not much there.

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:37.389
They really don't have much to offer.

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:41.389
Or it could be that the person is very talkative, loud, extroverted.

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:42.389
Same thing.

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:44.389
We label them form an opinion.

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:49.389
Could it be in those particular instances that we have become a takeer of faces?

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:54.389
We've made a judgment purely based on personal opinion

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:58.389
or what we feel is acceptable.

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:01.389
But to imitate Jehovah's way of thinking,

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:04.389
we have to go beyond the surface.

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:09.389
We have to focus on the character and the qualities of our brothers.

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:13.389
And with some people, that may take time.

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:16.389
You know what the geode, one expert stated,

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:19.389
there are many different ways to open a geode.

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:21.389
But no matter how you do it,

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:27.389
the key is patience, patience, patience.

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:30.389
And in the intro, this is the same with our brothers.

00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:34.389
It takes time and patience to get to know them.

00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:37.389
Time and patience to understand the way that they think,

00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:41.389
to show personal interest by asking questions,

00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:45.389
to work with them in the ministry and to consider their suggestions.

00:07:46.389 --> 00:07:50.389
But when we do, we'll reward it.

00:07:50.389 --> 00:07:52.389
We began to see the crystals.

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:56.389
We began to see their inner beauty inside.

00:07:56.389 --> 00:07:59.389
We discovered true depth in our brothers and sisters,

00:07:59.389 --> 00:08:03.389
and hopefully they do in us as well.

00:08:03.389 --> 00:08:05.389
Now going back to Jesus Disciples,

00:08:05.389 --> 00:08:08.389
while the Bible candidly details a number of accounts

00:08:08.389 --> 00:08:12.389
showing their human traits and their prejudicial feelings at times,

00:08:12.389 --> 00:08:16.389
it also highlights how they overcame those feelings.

00:08:16.389 --> 00:08:21.389
Just look at how much we read and meditate on the Christian Greek scriptures.

00:08:21.389 --> 00:08:26.389
And how much those verses and books emphasize love,

00:08:26.389 --> 00:08:28.389
opening our hearts, loving our brothers,

00:08:28.389 --> 00:08:32.389
getting along with one another, and widening out.

00:08:32.389 --> 00:08:35.389
The disciples did not allow any deep-rooted feelings,

00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:37.389
or things from their upbringing,

00:08:37.389 --> 00:08:41.389
or their environment to control them.

00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:45.389
And you and I can be the same.

00:08:45.389 --> 00:08:50.389
But it all starts with an honest self-examination.

00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:55.389
Can I identify any traces of prejudice within me?

00:08:55.389 --> 00:09:00.389
And if we can, well, it all starts with our thinking,

00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:05.389
elevating our thinking to Jehovah's way of thinking.

00:09:05.389 --> 00:09:09.389
Let's avoid surface judgments, being a takeer of faces.

00:09:09.389 --> 00:09:11.389
Let's take the time to get to know our brothers

00:09:11.389 --> 00:09:16.389
and appreciate their character and qualities, their inner beauty.

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:20.389
Jesus told His disciples at Matthew chapter 23 verse 8,

00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:22.389
all of you are brothers.

00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:24.389
And what made them brothers?

00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:26.389
Matthew chapter 12 verse 50,

00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:30.389
Jesus said, for whoever does the will of my Father,

00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:35.389
that one is my brother, and sister, and mother.

00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:38.389
It's a nice reminder, isn't it?

00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:41.389
We are all part of a large spiritual family,

00:09:41.389 --> 00:09:44.389
united by our faith and love for God.

00:09:44.389 --> 00:09:46.389
And if we see each other that way,

00:09:46.389 --> 00:09:49.389
that will help us to remain humble and recognize

00:09:49.389 --> 00:09:53.389
that we have no reason to elevate ourselves above others.

00:09:53.389 --> 00:09:57.389
Instead, we're going to be filled with so much love and appreciation

00:09:57.389 --> 00:09:59.389
to be part of this organization

00:09:59.389 --> 00:10:04.389
as we imitate our impartial God and Father, Jehovah.
