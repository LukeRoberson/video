00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.789
Caleb, why aren't you playing outside?

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.089
Dad said I'm punished.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.310
I see.

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:35.619
You know Dad loves you.

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:37.719
Even when he disciplines you.

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:44.380
Hey.

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:47.679
Do you remember when we planted the fruit tree?

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:49.880
Uh-huh.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.799
It grew fast.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.700
But then...

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:05.709
It fell over.

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:07.810
What did Dad do?

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.010
He helped it.

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:12.409
Right.

00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:18.540
Did the straps hurt the tree?

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:21.540
No, they helped it grow straight.

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:22.739
Yes.

00:01:23.239 --> 00:01:25.739
Jehovah and Dad correct you sometimes too.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.939
Like the tree.

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:29.739
Do you remember what the Bible says?

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.140
Jehovah disciplines.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.640
Uh...

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.840
Jehovah disciplines the ones he loves.

00:01:50.019 --> 00:01:50.519
Whoop.

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:52.019
Oh, Caleb.

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:54.969
I love you Dad.

00:01:55.269 --> 00:02:00.379
If discipline is love, he must love me a whole lot.

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:03.180
Yes, Caleb.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.780
Yes, I do.
