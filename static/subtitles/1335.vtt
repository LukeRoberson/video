00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.620
In January 2018, an historic event was held in Denmark.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:14.619
Over 51,000 viewers were tied in live from 500 different locations all over Scandinavia.

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:20.620
The new world translation of the Bible was simultaneously released in three languages,

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:27.600
Norwegian, Swedish and Danish.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.600
It's easy to read and it carefully conveys the original message.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:39.600
What is most outstanding with the new world translation is that it has restored God's name according to the original text.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.600
This is done out of respect for the author of the Bible, who says in Isaiah 42-8,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.600
I am Jehovah, that is my name.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.600
Unfortunately, two few Scandinavians know God's name,

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:01.600
though it can be found in various places with either Hebrew or Latin characters.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:09.640
It is pronounced in slightly different ways.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.640
What's the history of the divine name in Scandinavia?

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:28.430
Before the 16th century, the name was almost unknown because the Christian churches mostly used the Latin translation of the Bible called the Vulgate.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.430
Ordinary people didn't understand Latin.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.430
Moreover, God's name was replaced with titles such as Lord.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.430
In the 16th century, some brave and skilled men translated the Bible from the original languages.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.430
Where remarkably, they discovered God's name written almost 7,000 times.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:57.099
Sadly, these translators followed the long history of replacing God's name with titles.

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:07.540
Although several of them retained God's name at least a few times,

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.539
this burning desire to translate the Bible soon came to Scandinavia,

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:16.539
and also the knowledge of the divine name.

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:22.539
The first complete Danish Bible was released in 1550 by King Christian III.

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:28.539
In 1604, a Danish theologian named Hans Paulson Riesen met with King Christian IV

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:32.539
and pointed out some faults in the Danish Bible translation.

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:39.539
He was granted approval to translate the Bible directly from the Hebrew and Greek text into Danish.

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:43.539
Interestingly, it contains God's name in a marginal note.

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:48.539
The first Swedish translation was released in 1541.

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:53.539
King Gustav II Adolf released a revised version in 1618.

00:02:53.539 --> 00:03:00.539
In a note on Exodus 6.3 it says, God reveals his name Jehovah, Lord.

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:05.539
The first Scandinavian Bibles were mostly meant for church use,

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:10.539
but now people could at least listen to God's word in their own language.

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:15.539
Even though God's name was rarely used in these early Scandinavian Bible translations,

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:22.539
the name was discovered and started to be used in other contexts, for example, on coins.

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:28.539
God's name was also used in official royal motos of Swedish kings.

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:35.939
One of the motos can even be found on the front page of the Swedish law book from 1608.

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:42.939
King Charles IX also instituted a royal order called the Order of Jehovah.

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:51.939
Finally, a few translators took the importance step and reinstated Jehovah's name thousands of times in the Bible text.

00:03:51.939 --> 00:04:00.939
The Danish priest Kalkar states, why the expression Jehovah is used instead of Lord doesn't even need to be defended.

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:05.939
Some translators have shown the same respect for Jehovah's name to this day.

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:10.939
The Bible contains many other names we feel free to use,

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:15.939
so why shouldn't we use the name of the only true God, Jehovah?

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:25.439
Because this translation uses his name, it's much easier to get to know the person behind the name.

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:33.439
If I didn't know God's name, it would have been difficult for me to have a personal and close relationship to him.

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:38.439
This translation will be perfect for us to use when we teach our children.

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:42.439
I really look forward to using it to teach others about God.

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:45.439
It's amazing.

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:47.439
Thank you, Jehovah.

00:04:47.439 --> 00:05:05.860
In one of the most secular areas in the world, God's statement in Exodus 315 still proves to be true.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:14.860
Jehovah is my name forever, and this is how I am to be remembered from generation to generation.
