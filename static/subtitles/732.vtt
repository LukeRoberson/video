00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:08.359
With those lyrics shrieking in our ears, it puts us in mind of the next talk to be delivered by a brother Kenneth Cook.

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:13.019
The title is look beyond the finish line.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.660
Brother Cook, you have peaked our interests.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:25.469
You have completed your Gilead schooling. You've done well, and we warmly commend you.

00:00:25.969 --> 00:00:31.769
You've reached the finish line for this school. When the program concludes, you will be a graduate.

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.490
You've run this course, so to speak, with that goal in mind, haven't you?

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:45.530
Yet through it all, you also kept in mind that for you, this experience is a part of a bigger race, the race for life.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:53.609
Like determined runners, loyal servants of God keep moving forward after each goal in their service to him.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.450
Such goals are like stages in a race.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.929
Some of our goals and our pace may vary from person to person based on circumstances.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:12.489
For you, Gilead school is a goal or stage that you have now completed, but keep running.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:20.329
See, we run until we reach what our faith shows us, the prize waiting beyond the ultimate finish line

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:24.250
ever lasting life in the service of Jehovah.

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:30.650
The promise is found in God's Word, move us to keep reaching out for that prize.

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:35.290
Consider the Apostle Paul who was reaching out for the heavenly hope.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.890
At 2 Timothy 4, 7, and 8, he indicated that he had reached the finish line, his prize was in sight,

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.530
and it was reserved for him. He said, I have fought the fine fight. I have run the race to the

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:57.049
finish. I have observed the faith. From this time on, there is reserve for me the crown of righteousness.

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:05.849
With strong faith, Paul could see beyond the finish line, and he yearned for the reward that he

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:14.009
would receive. And then there is Jesus example. Just before breathing his last, he cried out,

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:21.689
it has been accomplished. Throughout his earthly ministry, that goal to accomplish Jehovah's will

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:28.169
for him never left his sight. No matter how painful his life course proved to be,

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:35.289
Jesus kept his integrity and finished that course like the true Son of God that he is.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:43.689
In all of this, Jesus saw more than just the finish line. He saw the endless joy that was waiting

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:52.810
for him. So powerful is Jesus example that Hebrews 12 verse 2 urges us to keep it centered in our

00:02:52.810 --> 00:03:01.530
sight. We invite you to follow along there with Hebrews 12 and verse 2. It says, as we look

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:09.610
intently, at the chief agent and perfector of our faith, Jesus, for the joy that was set before

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:17.050
him he endured a torture state, despising shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:25.930
God. Who were we urged to look at intently? The perfector of our faith, Jesus. And what did Jesus

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:34.169
look at? What did he see? He saw the joy that his faith placed directly in front of him. Jesus

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:41.129
focused on the joy that would result from his life course of perfect integrity, from providing

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:49.370
the ransom for us and from being back alongside his heavenly Father. Jesus never took his eyes off

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:55.849
the prize waiting beyond the finish line and neither should we. Let's look at some important

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:02.090
lessons that will help all of us to complete the race for life. We will consider two main points.

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:10.729
First, how should you run each stage of the race? And second, qualities that will help you to

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:17.610
run like a true Christian and win. Now for the first point, how should you run each stage of the

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:24.089
race? The race for life is a race of endurance, and as mentioned, it includes stages or success

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:31.209
of goals. We strive for each goal at our individual best pace and with a clear focus on the

00:04:31.209 --> 00:04:41.370
ultimate goal or prize. First Timothy 619 calls that prize the real life, that is everlasting life

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:48.889
in perfection, either in heaven or on earth. As mentioned, your Gilead training is now a completed

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:56.170
stage of the race for you, with humility, apply all that you have learned, and remain focused on

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:04.009
the endless joy ahead of you. When hardships and difficulties come, and they well, keep moving

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:12.170
forward. If you are knocked down by anything, get back up and run with determination with everything

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:19.930
that you've got. Be like the marathon runner from the country of Tanzania, who ran in the 1968

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:27.050
Olympics held in Mexico City. At one point during that race, he was bumped by other runners,

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:33.529
and he fell to the ground so hard that he gashed his knee and dislocated it. He also smashed his

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:40.569
shoulder against the pavement. Yet after receiving some medical attention, he refused to stop running.

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:48.810
He continued in the race. His pace was slower, but he moved forward toward his goal. He was no

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:54.170
longer running for a mere material prize. He was running to complete the race with his honor

00:05:54.170 --> 00:06:02.170
intact, and that of the land he represented. He finished the race. In the race for life, you may

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:08.410
experience times when you feel as if someone or something is trying to knock you down. What will you

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:16.410
do? Learn from what happened to the Galatians. When some in the first century allowed the speech

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.129
and actions of others to knock them out of the race, notice what Paul said to them,

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:31.529
Galatians 5 and verses 7 and 8. Imagine that he has an incredulous tone as he speaks to him and states

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:40.730
in verse 7. You were running well. Who hindered you from continuing to obey the truth? This sort of

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:49.209
persuasion does not come from the one calling you. What was the problem? Some in Galatia had allowed

00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:55.769
themselves to be persuaded by false teachings, and they were no longer obeying the truth. They

00:06:55.769 --> 00:07:05.769
gave into pressure. Also, in verse 13, Paul refers to the danger of fleshly desires. Whatever happened

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:12.250
to them, those Christian runners were hindered, as he said, because they took their eyes off of the

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:20.250
prize. All of us must keep that lesson in front of us. If we do, we will never be hindered or thrown

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:29.370
off course in our pursuit of the real life. We will be rock solid in our focus. When others see

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:34.889
that you are looking straight ahead toward the prize, they are helped to look in the same direction.

00:07:35.769 --> 00:07:40.889
Continue to be a real stabilizing influence in the branches where you will serve.

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.930
So, for our first point, how should you run each stage of the race?

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:52.970
Run at your very best pace, and with a clear focus on your ultimate goal, the real life.

00:07:53.930 --> 00:08:01.610
Now, for our second main point, qualities that will help you to run like a true Christian and win.

00:08:03.209 --> 00:08:07.610
We run as true Christians when we follow the example of Christ.

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:14.810
Jesus' example of doing all things for Jehovah's glory, despite the suffering that he endured,

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:21.529
is one that we must follow. First, Peter 2.21 reminds us that Christ suffered for you,

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:30.009
leaving a model for you to follow his steps closely. Let's consider two qualities that Jesus

00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:38.169
had in abundance, and that we must imitate closely. Faith and courage. For each quality,

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:46.169
we will look at why we need it to win, so we begin with faith. Now, you do not need to be told

00:08:46.169 --> 00:08:51.370
what faith is. You have it, and you've learned much about examples of faith in your studies.

00:08:52.409 --> 00:08:58.970
We need faith because faith helps us to endure, and faith helps us to remember that our trials

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:05.929
in life are temporary. We look ahead with confidence. We see beyond the troubles of today,

00:09:05.929 --> 00:09:12.970
and we trust Jehovah every step of the way. You needed to have faith after you arrived for this

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:19.690
school, and then had to wait patiently for some months for your classes to begin. True? You

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:25.210
know it out wondered, when will the classes start? How will they be carried out in a pandemic?

00:09:26.009 --> 00:09:31.929
You waited, and in due time, your faith was rewarded. Jehovah saw to it that things worked out,

00:09:31.929 --> 00:09:36.570
didn't he? Your instructors, and so many others working with them,

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:43.370
ensured that the school moved forward safely, and that you received the full benefit from the classes.

00:09:44.649 --> 00:09:50.009
That experience highlights the kind of faith that all of us will need in the days ahead,

00:09:50.009 --> 00:09:56.970
whenever new challenges arise. You could say that 2020 vision will be necessary for each of us

00:09:57.129 --> 00:10:03.850
to keep running successfully, and I don't mean the year 2020. True Christians look far ahead with

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:10.889
clear spiritual vision. That's the point, and remain focused on the prize beyond the finish line.

00:10:12.169 --> 00:10:18.809
Those without faith cannot see it. They cannot focus on things unseen, but those with faith

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:26.809
can see it. That is why they, why you, remained focused on Jehovah's promises.

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:34.009
The scriptures are just to keep looking ahead. An example of this is found at 2 Corinthians

00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:44.330
chapter 4 and verses 17 and 18. 2 Corinthians 4, 17 and 18. Now when writing these inspired words,

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:51.210
Paul was encouraging the brothers not to allow problems, difficulties, and persecutions to cloud

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:57.210
or block their view of the glorious reward that was set before them. Please look at what is said

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:05.610
starting in verse 17. For though the tribulation is momentary in light, it works out for us a

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:13.289
glory that is of more and more surpassing greatness and is everlasting. While we keep our eyes,

00:11:13.289 --> 00:11:19.769
not on the things seen, but on the things unseen. For the things seen are temporary,

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:29.610
but the things unseen are ever lasting. Again, these inspired words should move us to look beyond

00:11:30.169 --> 00:11:37.210
the trials we face and to remain focused on what is ahead of us. Paul was speaking to those with

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:44.169
the heavenly hope, but the encouragement and meaning behind these words applies to all who are

00:11:44.169 --> 00:11:52.970
running for the real life. That is for the things ever lasting as it says here. When we are determined

00:11:52.970 --> 00:12:00.649
and focused, we are helped to press on each day. Proverbs 4, 25 tells us to look straight ahead,

00:12:01.529 --> 00:12:09.929
fix your eyes or your gaze straight ahead of you. To keep doing that, we need faith. We need good

00:12:09.929 --> 00:12:16.889
spiritual eyesight to see what is otherwise unseen, as Paul said. Keep in mind that the objective

00:12:16.889 --> 00:12:22.250
of your Gilead training is to strengthen and stabilize the field and branch organization.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:28.570
Whether a brother or sister, your example of faith, goes a long way in doing that.

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:33.529
Others will imitate the faith and example of a determined runner.

00:12:34.809 --> 00:12:41.049
When you are settled in your assignments, keep your eyes of faith set on doing God's will.

00:12:42.169 --> 00:12:47.289
Danger can come when you start to feel that you've achieved most or even all of your goals.

00:12:48.009 --> 00:12:53.769
What could be the result? When we lose sight of the race and of its prize,

00:12:53.850 --> 00:13:00.649
our interests will focus on other things, perhaps material things. Don't let this happen to you.

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:08.730
Never allow distractions to pull you off of the Christian course and avoid ever becoming self-satisfied

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:16.409
because of privileges that you may come to enjoy. Focus on the real life and remain humble.

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:23.529
Appreciate your privileges in Jehovah's service, but remain focused on what you desire most,

00:13:24.169 --> 00:13:31.129
pleasing Jehovah and doing his will forever. As we read earlier in Hebrews 12,

00:13:31.129 --> 00:13:39.129
when Jesus suffered unjustly to the point of death, he endured for the joy that was set before him.

00:13:39.129 --> 00:13:45.690
He always looked at what was ahead of him. The reward that he longed for was clear to him.

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:52.330
It was that real to him. We must always remember Jesus' example as we keep looking ahead.

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:59.529
Maintain your strong faith by reading God's word every day and applying its counsel in everything

00:13:59.529 --> 00:14:05.450
that you do. We endure in the race with courage when our faith is strong.

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:13.049
And that is the second quality we will now look at courage. Why we need courage to win.

00:14:14.009 --> 00:14:20.809
True Christians have courage that stems from their faith. We live with hope, with expectation,

00:14:20.809 --> 00:14:26.809
and not just any expectation, but assured expectation as the Scriptures call it.

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:33.769
When your rescued is assured, it gives you courage, doesn't it? Imagine how Jeremiah felt when

00:14:33.769 --> 00:14:40.970
Ebed Melek and 30 other men arrived to pull him up out of a deep sister. What could have seemed hopeless

00:14:41.529 --> 00:14:46.730
was now a moment filled with hope, and he continued on with courage.

00:14:48.009 --> 00:14:54.490
Courage moves us to look beyond any obstacles that may stand between us and the finish line.

00:14:54.490 --> 00:15:00.409
The fact is that nothing promised in God's word will fail to come true. So take courage.

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:07.769
Keep in mind that your determination to do God's will means that for you the prize will be waiting.

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:15.690
Jehovah cannot lie. Therefore, as you go to your assignments, remain calm and assured of Jehovah's

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:21.929
help. True, great changes have taken place in the world since you arrived for Gilead school.

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:28.409
But though the world is changing around us and certainly not for the better, remember Jehovah's

00:15:28.409 --> 00:15:36.970
promises. What we see happening is temporary. Pandemic, nothing new, Jesus foretolded, didn't he?

00:15:37.529 --> 00:15:45.690
Pastelances, he called it in one place after another. So we're not shaken by this. We have faith

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:52.330
and courage and we keep going, don't we? Think back to the Olympic marathon runner from Tanzania

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:59.129
who we mentioned earlier. After being injured, he was bandaged and then continued to run.

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:04.169
It took courage and determination to run and sometimes walk through the pain.

00:16:05.129 --> 00:16:09.769
When he eventually crossed the finish line, he was cheered by the small crowd remaining in

00:16:09.769 --> 00:16:18.570
the stadium. A try to imagine he was limping with his bandages blowing in the wind, but he moved

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:25.210
forward toward his goal. For many, the race would have been long over. But that man was running for

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:30.970
something more than a material prize. He saw something greater beyond that finish line.

00:16:31.929 --> 00:16:40.250
What was it? We find it in what he said afterward. When he was asked why he continued on in the race,

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:49.129
he replied, My country did not send me 5,000 miles to start the race. They sent me 5,000 miles to

00:16:49.129 --> 00:16:57.370
finish the race. That sense of responsibility gave him the courage to go on despite the pain.

00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:04.490
He saw a greater purpose and he returned home with honor. We too have a greater responsibility

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:11.609
in a far more important race. We owe it to Jehovah to keep running the Christian course.

00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:19.930
He and his son gave everything you could say so that we can keep running. We also owe it to others.

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:28.170
To set a good example for them that will motivate them never to give up. And we owe it to ourselves

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:34.410
to use what we have been given so as to run in a way that we gain the real life.

00:17:35.609 --> 00:17:41.529
We are certain that you have both the faith and the courage to run with the eyes of your heart

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:46.650
looking intently at Jesus' example and at the prize.

00:17:48.009 --> 00:17:53.369
Soon review. What is the overall lesson for you, Gilea graduates, and really for every Christian

00:17:53.369 --> 00:18:00.890
runner? It is this. Run for the real life at your very best pace. Jehovah will help you.

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:09.690
Run with a clear focus on your ultimate goal and run the course with faith and with courage.

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:16.410
When will the finish line be reached? For those who will live forever on earth, the Revelation

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:24.410
climax book states this in chapter 11, quote, by exercising faith throughout Jesus' millennial reign

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:31.130
and during the decisive test that follows, these will be rewarded with life everlasting in paradise

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:38.170
on earth. Their names will then remain indelibly written in the book of life. End of quote.

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:44.890
For true servants of God, that decisive test will be nothing to fear. They will never drop out

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:50.250
of the race. For them, that test will be just another day on the calendar, so to speak. They will

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:58.890
keep going with their eyes fixed on what is ahead for them. Faith, courage, and all other godly

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:06.730
qualities will carry loyal ones into the real life. Use your Gilea training to run the race well,

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:14.970
strengthen others to do the same. See the prize ahead of you and follow Jesus steps closely.

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:22.170
Run the race through the approaching great tribulation and then keep running like a true Christian.

00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:29.190
Due to the circumstances, the students have already received their diplomas.

00:19:30.069 --> 00:19:36.950
But we know you would like to see them and hear where they are being assigned. So I'm happy

00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:41.910
to have Brother Ronald Kerzen with me. He serves as a helper to the teaching committee.

00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:51.589
And why am I happy? Because he's going to pronounce all the students names for me and let us know

00:19:51.589 --> 00:20:02.809
their assignments. Brother Kerzen, we are waiting on you. Brother and sister James will be returning to

00:20:02.809 --> 00:20:17.849
Trinidad and Tobago. Brother Kasambala will be returning to Malawi. Brother Lee will be serving

00:20:17.849 --> 00:20:26.579
in the United States. Brother and sister Luzitu will be returning to Congo Kinshasa.

00:20:29.769 --> 00:20:39.430
Sister Mananzala will be returning to the Philippines. Brother and sister Mahia will be returning

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:53.660
to Colombia. Brother Kurango will be returning to Malawi. Sister Teitoa will be returning to

00:20:53.660 --> 00:21:07.589
Zimbabwe. Brother Pereira will be returning to Brazil. Brother and sister Pong Ce will be returning

00:21:07.589 --> 00:21:21.420
to Thailand. Brother Reyes will be returning to Mexico. Brother and sister Santiago will be returning

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:33.480
to the Philippines. Brother and sister Sosu will be returning to Cote d'Avoire. Brother and sister

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:46.970
Tenda will be returning to Senegal. Brother and sister Thompson will be returning to Zambia. Brother

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:53.990
Brother Takatsuke, we'll be returning to Ukraine.

00:21:53.990 --> 00:22:01.190
Brother Zach will be returning to Korea.

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:02.809
Thank you, Brother Curson.

00:22:03.769 --> 00:22:08.210
Well, we have seen them couple by couple

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:10.809
and person by person.

00:22:10.809 --> 00:22:14.369
But would you like to see all 25 of these happy

00:22:14.369 --> 00:22:17.920
graduates together?

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:23.789
There they are.

00:22:23.789 --> 00:22:25.670
We can just imagine the applause

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:31.859
from all of your individual apartments and homes out there.

00:22:31.859 --> 00:22:34.019
Ron Curson is still with us,

00:22:34.019 --> 00:22:36.940
and that is because we're going to have a letter read

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:39.099
from the class.

00:22:39.099 --> 00:22:44.180
And since he already knows how to pronounce the brother's name,

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:49.920
I'm going to let Ron introduce him again.

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:56.079
The class letter will be read by Brother Pong's CE

00:22:56.079 --> 00:23:02.329
to the Cuffinning Body and the Bethel family.

00:23:02.329 --> 00:23:06.250
We were so excited when we received our invitations

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:10.289
to attend the 149th Class of Gilead.

00:23:10.289 --> 00:23:15.250
However, when it was an outstep, the 149th class

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:20.410
would be postponed and society filled our hearts

00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:24.930
as to what our future would be.

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:29.529
To help in allowing this society, the Cuffinning Body

00:23:29.529 --> 00:23:33.569
made loving decisions to comfort us.

00:23:33.569 --> 00:23:38.369
We never felt abandoned or forgotten.

00:23:38.369 --> 00:23:42.369
One thing we were absolutely confident

00:23:42.369 --> 00:23:47.490
of was that the Cuffinning Body would do all that could

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:52.019
to make sure we have the class.

00:23:52.019 --> 00:23:56.259
We are ever thankful for the Bethel family who

00:23:56.259 --> 00:24:01.579
warmly welcome us into their hearts and their home.

00:24:01.579 --> 00:24:04.740
It seemed every day someone would ask,

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:06.660
do you need anything?

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:09.700
Or how can I help you?

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:13.940
We have served this beautiful, obedient, Bethel family

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:16.900
and have learned a lot, especially

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:20.299
how to show personal interest in concrete ways

00:24:20.299 --> 00:24:23.460
during difficult times.

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:26.700
We can say that we had practical lessons

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:34.220
in endurance, love, concern for others, trust in Jehovah,

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:38.259
obedience, and Cuffinning.

00:24:38.259 --> 00:24:44.259
This is an example that we will take with us in our hearts

00:24:44.259 --> 00:24:50.740
and try to reflect in our dealings with others.

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:52.019
One is cool started.

00:24:52.019 --> 00:24:55.579
We could see Jehovah's hand in the arrangements

00:24:55.579 --> 00:25:00.259
and how brothers taking the lead trusted in Jehovah

00:25:00.259 --> 00:25:04.259
and the arrangements he had in praise.

00:25:04.259 --> 00:25:07.019
That's one of our first lessons.

00:25:07.019 --> 00:25:10.140
We want to follow that fire example,

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:16.980
in showing trust in Jehovah for whatever lies ahead.

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:22.539
We were touched by the sincerity of our instructors,

00:25:22.539 --> 00:25:28.779
gifts in men who helped us to broaden and improve

00:25:28.779 --> 00:25:33.460
our understanding of the scriptures.

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:37.539
It is our hearts felt desire to do,

00:25:37.539 --> 00:25:44.019
as Sam is saying, as Sam 105 was one.

00:25:44.019 --> 00:25:47.259
Give thanks to Jehovah.

00:25:47.259 --> 00:25:53.779
Call on his name, make his deeds known among the people.

00:25:53.779 --> 00:26:00.539
Yes, we want to share what we have learned with humble hearts

00:26:00.539 --> 00:26:06.099
all to the praise of our grand instructor, Jehovah God.

00:26:06.099 --> 00:26:11.220
More than that, we are determined to use all that we have learned

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:13.819
to continue to grow spiritually

00:26:13.819 --> 00:26:21.539
and be used in whatever way Jehovah decides to use us.

00:26:21.539 --> 00:26:27.140
All that we experience during our time here makes us appreciate

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:30.099
our loving worldwide brotherhood.

00:26:30.099 --> 00:26:37.180
All the more and continues to give us insight into what it will be like

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:41.140
to live together in Jehovah's new world.

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:45.940
We take all these memories and lessons we learn here

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:54.380
onto our assignments and we are determined to follow your example

00:26:54.380 --> 00:27:01.750
in bringing honor and glory to our Heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:09.799
You are brothers and sisters, one in the 49th class of Gilead.

00:27:09.799 --> 00:27:14.119
Thank you for the beautiful sentiments expressed in that class letter.

00:27:14.119 --> 00:27:18.420
They were truly heartfelt.

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:24.299
I concluded my opening comments with Deuteronomy 817 and 18.

00:27:24.299 --> 00:27:32.779
In part, it said, remember that it is Jehovah your God who gives power to you.

00:27:32.779 --> 00:27:36.420
You have had five months of wonderful instruction.

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:43.420
You have learned so much that you likely did not fully appreciate before.

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:47.779
You have been elevated personally by this experience.

00:27:47.779 --> 00:27:51.940
It has improved your knowledge of God's Word.

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:57.420
You may have already noticed that your Christian personality has developed even further

00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:59.940
than when you came.

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:09.529
But always remember, the gifts you have attained are not by your own power and strength.

00:28:09.529 --> 00:28:20.309
Please find with me Isaiah 40 verses 29-331.

00:28:20.309 --> 00:28:26.470
The thought of a source of power is woven throughout the scriptures.

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:32.549
Verse 28 is speaking about Jehovah, the creator of the ends of the earth.

00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:38.470
But let's now read chapter 40 verse 29.

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:47.730
He gives power to the tired one and full might to those lacking in strength.

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:51.329
I am old and tired.

00:28:51.329 --> 00:28:57.309
Is Jehovah going to infuse me with physical power and strength?

00:28:57.309 --> 00:29:00.950
I wouldn't complain if he chose to do so.

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:05.190
But that is not the kind of power being discussed.

00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:08.430
It's not physical power.

00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:10.670
Well, how do we know it?

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:12.950
Look at verse 30.

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:17.509
It says, even boys and young men get tired physically.

00:29:17.509 --> 00:29:20.390
Verse 30 says,

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:28.880
boys will tire out and grow weary and young men will stumble and fall.

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:36.200
So then what kind of power can we expect from Jehovah according to these verses?

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:40.640
It's power to reinvigorate us spiritually.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:46.759
The power to help us carry out our theocratic activities to the extent our physical strength

00:29:46.759 --> 00:29:47.759
allows.

00:29:47.759 --> 00:29:53.200
It's the power to endure the trials of life.

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.559
Now verse 31.

00:29:55.559 --> 00:29:59.599
But those hoping in Jehovah will regain power.

00:29:59.599 --> 00:30:02.920
They will soar on wings like eagles.

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:05.440
They will run and not grow weary.

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:11.039
They will walk and not tire out.

00:30:11.039 --> 00:30:16.720
In that verse, hope and power are linked together.

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:23.279
By hoping in Jehovah and depending on his strength, we can soar like an eagle far above

00:30:23.279 --> 00:30:25.920
the challenges we face.

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:30.380
We can accomplish the assignments we're given.

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:36.859
I wasn't sure if I could complete this assignment as the chairman of the Gilead graduation.

00:30:36.859 --> 00:30:41.380
But here we are at the last part of the program.

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:51.279
Consider with me a final scriptural thought, Romans 15-13.

00:30:51.279 --> 00:30:55.680
Here too, hope and power are linked together.

00:30:55.680 --> 00:31:04.880
We can consider this as our prayer for you, the 25 graduates of the 149th class.

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:08.700
Verse 13.

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:16.180
May the God who gives hope, fill you with all joy and peace by your trusting in him,

00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:24.940
so that you may abound and hope with power of Holy Spirit.

00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:28.859
Trust absolutely in Jehovah and not in yourself.

00:31:28.859 --> 00:31:37.660
If you do so, the verse said you will abound and hope with power of Holy Spirit.

00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:42.220
Holy Spirit reminds us of the fruity of the Spirit.

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:49.660
Make it a project to work on each of the nine aspects of the Spirit mentioned in Galatians

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:55.059
5-22 and 23.

00:31:55.059 --> 00:31:57.980
We love all of you.

00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:01.619
I am still open to Romans 15.

00:32:01.619 --> 00:32:08.859
My concluding comment to you is in the 33rd verse.

00:32:08.859 --> 00:32:15.259
May the God who gives peace be with all of you, amen.
