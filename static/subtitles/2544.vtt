00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:38.990
I had a secret, only it wasn't mine to tell, it was my best friends, Julian.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:57.600
This was not the Julian I knew.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.640
At the end of the meeting, Brother Max wanted to know if I was okay.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:17.109
I shrugged it off, I just didn't know who to talk to at that point.

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:55.709
A few years ago, when my parents stopped attending meetings, Julian was there for me.

00:01:55.709 --> 00:02:17.650
I didn't want to lose my friend, but did I really know him?

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:24.280
I decided to ask Julian about the pictures he posted.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.800
I told him it wasn't right.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.280
He needed to talk to the elders.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:38.599
Then he got really defensive about it.

00:02:38.599 --> 00:03:03.340
I knew I did the right thing, I just needed someone to talk to.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.699
Brother Max wanted to know how I was really doing.

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:25.740
He could tell something was wrong, so I opened up, I told him everything.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:31.340
I didn't want to get my friend in trouble, Max understood.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:43.689
He asked me to read James 5 verses 14 and 15, is there anyone sick among you?

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:51.080
Let him call the elders of the congregation to him, and let them pray over him, applying

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.759
oil to him in the name of Jehovah.

00:03:55.759 --> 00:04:00.719
And the prayer of faith will make this sick one well.

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:07.280
And Jehovah will raise him up.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:14.360
Max showed me that the elders can encourage and strengthen a spiritually weak person.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:21.509
Covering up a friend's wrongdoing prevents him from getting the spiritual help he needs.

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:31.160
All this time, I was focused on Julian and his deception, and I didn't speak up.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.959
I'm glad I was honest with Brother Max.

00:04:34.959 --> 00:04:41.279
The elders are like your spiritual doctors, and even more, there are friends.

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:44.079
They want to help us.

00:04:44.079 --> 00:04:48.959
Julian might receive discipline, but that's an expression of Jehovah's love.

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:57.250
He could save his spiritual life.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:11.920
Julian got the spiritual help he needed, and I kept my best friend.
