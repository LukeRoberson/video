00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:11.140
That's a heavy one, son. Let me help you.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.140
I can do it, Papa.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.140
You're gonna help yourself, son. Now, I need someone to prepare the talking machine.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.140
I can do it.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.140
Off you go, then.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:30.629
I was born on December the 4th, 1916, at a place called Serum Pennsylvania.

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:33.630
I'm 102 years old.

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:46.729
My father took the photogram or creation around.

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:52.549
I'm very appreciative of my parents, but they did.

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:57.549
In 1931, I attended the Convention of Columbus, Ohio.

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:00.549
And I already knew my friend, Helen,

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:05.900
and when, brother and brother, she announced the new name of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.620
she got read-and-soons about it.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.620
So, the first thing I did when I got into my pioneer work was write to Helen.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.620
The second letter she wrote, she says, you didn't tell me.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.620
The question I wanted to know, whether I was a pioneer or not,

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.620
I wrote, I am a pioneer, and I hope to always be.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:39.329
And then we got a letter from Brooklyn asking us if we were willing to go on the traveling work.

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.329
And we accepted, and so we went to West Kentucky.

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.329
Aubrey and Bertha Bibbins were both from Kentucky, too.

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.329
You know how it is, a couple of brothers or good friends,

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:57.930
and the wives or good friends.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.069
When we went together, we were already good friends.

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:06.069
But then the surprise came.

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:14.939
We were assigned to Guatemala, and we'd you believe it.

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:18.939
We were assigned to the Bibbins in the missionary home.

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:24.939
So, when they were assigned to her to buy us, it was a sad thing.

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:36.099
It was a real heartbreaker to separate from the Bibbins.

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:42.099
Then we were assigned back to Guatemala City, to the grandchildren of us.

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.099
We had an active life.

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.099
We had many years of blessings.

00:02:47.099 --> 00:03:00.949
We were very good husband and wife.

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:03.949
And when my wife was six, it was very sad.

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:25.289
If I've come to the end of my life, I begged you over to take care of my David.

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:29.289
Thank you for him, Jehovah.

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:32.289
And for our marriage.

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:35.289
So wonderful.

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:37.289
And so happy.

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:56.560
The day Sister Helen passed away, I went to his room, and I was thinking,

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.560
I want to tell David that he's not alone.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.560
That I can accompany him if he wants me to.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.560
And that'll be his traveling companion whenever he needs me.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:14.250
I think he knew he'd had an incredibly good life with Sister Helen, a wonderful life.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.250
But also that he had to keep on going.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.250
He never isolated himself.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:27.839
After Sister Helen died, Brother David kept on serving on the Guatemala Branch Committee for another 18 years.

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:36.100
Then Brother David moved to the assembly hall in San Lucas.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.100
I think living in the assembly hall has done Brother David a lot of good.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:50.509
Every weekend he has the opportunity to associate with the brothers and sisters.

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:52.509
We have assembly.

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:57.509
And they're not my assembly, but I know many of the people who I go down and say hello to them.

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:00.509
It's like the Bible says about the Christians.

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:02.509
That's what made the difference.

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:11.139
That they loved each other.

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:13.139
Well, it's wonderful.

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:24.160
I had lots of friends too.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.160
My precious one.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:33.970
I ask you to put this text on your desk.

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:43.800
It applies to you in your long years of service to Jehovah.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.800
Hebrews 6.10 says,

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:54.800
God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you've shown for His name.
