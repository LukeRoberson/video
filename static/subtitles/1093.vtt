00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:12.710
Katoto aida pati sapu hapashari

00:00:12.710 --> 00:03:33.430
Ayatvili

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.430
How can you sing as many gays?

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:43.000
Can you see the clouds in the sky?

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.229
The sun is shining there

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:57.050
The parade is on the rise of the dream

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.050
It's not just a beautiful dream

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.050
It's just a beautiful dream

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:16.620
A beautiful house is standing

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.620
And the river flows through the clouds

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:25.339
The water is running out

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:29.170
And the parade begins

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.170
The parade is going on

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:41.899
These beautiful new waves

00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:44.899
We'll go to this time

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:48.899
Tell friends about it

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:57.269
And we'll go to heaven

00:04:57.269 --> 00:05:02.379
The sun is shining there

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:08.209
And a fresh spring is so beautiful

00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:12.209
A dream is so beautiful

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:21.550
And we'll go to this time

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:33.959
Now something is missing

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:37.959
It's so beautiful to see me

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:45.459
I've been dreaming so often, like you and I fall in love

00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:48.959
Almost already in the middle of the night

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:52.959
It's been a long time since I've seen you

00:05:52.959 --> 00:05:56.959
My world of God is talking about

00:05:56.959 --> 00:06:00.959
It's full of happiness, just like he says

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:04.959
And my heart is already much lighter

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:08.959
Yeah, the time is getting faster

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:12.959
This day I can't see you

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:15.959
Here we are at the end of the night
