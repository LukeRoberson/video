WEBVTT

00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.320
We are looking forward to giving you this congress free.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.000
You bring the title of wisdom,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.320
and bring it to you.

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:14.359
Annual conventions are a spiritual highlight

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:17.559
for Jehovah's Witnesses around the globe.

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:23.140
They follow the Bible precedent set in ancient Israel.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.460
Arrangements for conventions begin with the Convention Department.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.100
It sounds so important that our conventions...

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.219
careful thought is given to convention, location, and size.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.259
Arrangements are made for these large gatherings

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:56.079
in all parts of the earth.

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.840
At times, delegates from other countries join local witnesses

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.320
for a truly international gathering

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.200
that demonstrates the worldwide unity

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.040
found in viable-based beliefs and morality.
