00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:13.699
I'm not interested.

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:17.260
Have you ever had someone tell you that in the ministry?

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.579
Some people may simply want us to go away.

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:25.219
Others, however, may end the conversation if they can't see how our message affects

00:00:25.219 --> 00:00:27.260
them personally.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.060
So we need to present information that will help our listeners and then show them how

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.820
to apply what they just heard.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.060
For instance, imagine that a natural disaster has recently affected part of your territory.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.060
How might you include this in your presentation?

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.060
Let's watch an example.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.060
Hello.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.060
It's good to meet you.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.659
I'm glad to see that this neighborhood wasn't affected by the recent heavy rains and

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:54.659
mudslide.

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:58.780
Yeah, it wasn't too bad here, but we did have a few trees fall behind the house.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.539
Well, I don't want to take a lot of your time.

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:05.219
We're calling to talk about hope for loved ones who've died.

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:06.939
Do you think we'll ever see them again?

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:08.340
Thanks, but I'm not really interested.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.659
What just happened?

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.340
Would you say that the publisher made clear the practical value of his information?

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.180
Although he mentioned the recent storm, he failed to notice its effect on the householder.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.819
And when he learned how the householder felt, he didn't tailor his presentation to the

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:31.340
man's needs.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.540
True, all of the good news of the kingdom is valuable.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.260
But some aspects may appeal to people more at specific times in their life.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:50.700
Moreover, if we ignore topics that are on people's minds, they might think we're inconsiderate

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.500
or rude.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.859
In the example we just watched, what Bible account might have made the person think?

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:02.540
Let's watch again.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.859
My heart goes out to those who've lost their homes in the recent heavy rains and mudslide.

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:08.340
Me too.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.180
We've been helping a family member try to recover some personal belongings.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.900
We're just happy that no one was hurt.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.340
Well, that's a relief for sure.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.340
And it's nice to see the community coming together to help one another.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.659
Did you know that the Bible promises a time when we'll no longer experience devastation

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.099
from so-called natural disasters?

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:28.099
Really?

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:29.099
What do you mean?

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.819
Well, think about the power Jesus displayed when he lived on the earth.

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.860
Notice what it says here at Mark 4, verse 39.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:46.379
With that, he got up and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, hush, be quiet, and the

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.090
wind abated.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.409
The publisher used a local topic of interest and the Bible account that the householder

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:57.889
could relate to.

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:02.210
We can also make practical application of our material when giving a talk.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:09.009
However, when teaching an audience what to do, be careful not to burden them with guilt.

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:15.569
Instead strengthen their love and faith and express confidence in their good motives.

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:21.050
If you're preparing a public talk, consider the needs of newly interested ones.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:27.050
Ask yourself, how can I help this audience to draw close to Jehovah and overcome obstacles

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:30.330
that could hinder them from making progress?

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.169
Let's watch a brief excerpt from a public talk.

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:38.330
Hebrews 10, 24 and 25 says,

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:44.409
And let us consider one another so as to incite to love and find works, not forsaking our

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:50.569
meeting together as some have the custom, but encouraging one another and all the more

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.610
so as you see the day drawing near.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:02.370
So if it's your custom to miss meetings here at the Kingdom Hall, you need to change.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.210
Jehovah knows when you're here and when you're not.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:13.060
Armageddon's coming and you don't want to miss out on everlasting life.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.460
Was that encouraging?

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.420
Was it motivating to those attending their first congregation meeting?

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.459
Although the speaker clearly showed what the audience needed to do, how might he have

00:04:25.459 --> 00:04:29.220
strengthened their motivation?

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.540
Hebrews 10, 24 and 25 says,

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:40.300
And let us consider one another so as to incite to love and find works, not forsaking

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:47.259
our meeting together as some have the custom, but encouraging one another and all the more

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:51.019
so as you see the day drawing near.

00:04:51.019 --> 00:04:58.220
Within these verses, we find important reasons to attend congregation meetings regularly.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:04.100
For instance, we receive encouragement who doesn't need that.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:10.220
This is true all the more so since we're living in critical times and Jehovah's Day is

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.660
drawing near.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:18.100
Moreover, attending congregation meetings gives us the opportunity to incite others to

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.060
love and find works.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.740
Yes, even your presence here is motivating.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.379
How so?

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:31.740
Because you've shown that no matter what else is happening in your life, there is nothing

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:38.579
more important to you than praising and honoring Jehovah here with the congregation.

00:05:38.579 --> 00:05:44.100
So just seeing you here fills us with strength.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:49.860
By making the practical value of our message clear to our listeners, we help them to understand

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:55.100
how the information affects their lives, and we motivate them to action.
