00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.769
Exciting progress is underway at the Rambo-Post site.

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:11.769
Since receiving the final site plan approval in November 2024,

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:14.769
full-scale site work operations have begun,

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.769
resulting in the movement of countless truckloads of earth and rock.

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:24.769
On site rock crushing equipment then allows us to repurpose the material,

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.769
making the most of our resources.

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.769
We have also started planning new trees,

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.770
which help stabilize the land and assist with erosion control.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.770
It's especially encouraging to see how many young ones have reached out to volunteer.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:56.539
Their energy and willingness to serve provide a beautiful example of faith in action.

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.539
Here's what just a few of them have to say about why they reached out

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.540
and how they feel about serving on this exciting project.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.540
So my desire started a few years back when my parents joined back then in the RBC.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.540
And as far as I can remember, that was always my goal.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.540
I always wanted to become a construction servant.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.540
One day randomly I was checking on my GW hub and the application was there.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.540
I was really excited that I got back from the data service or something.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.540
I got on my computer and I started filling out the application almost immediately.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.540
So when I got the call, I thought,

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.540
I think they had the wrong number.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.540
So it was just such a great privilege to be able to be called.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.540
But I was super nervous, actually.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.540
And I remember a few minutes after I got off the phone with the brother,

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.540
I immediately called my parents.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:56.540
I had told them that I had said, yes, I'm going to serve in Ramropo and they were so happy for me.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.540
Yeah, I remember one of the sisters that first welcomed us.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.540
They said, welcome to me and everything.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.540
And then they turned around and saw my parents and gave them a big hug.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.539
And said, thank you for giving us your son and that really made them feel very good.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:18.430
So I just want to make sure that I live in a way I am able to look back and smile.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.430
And I can tell people how amazing it was.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.430
Well, it's been amazing so far of the project.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.430
My favorite part is being able to wake up every single morning

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.430
and know that I'm going to be working for Jehovah.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.430
Some nights I get home and I just want to go directly to bed.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.430
And I sit in bed for a little bit and like, that was awesome.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.430
You get to do more so if you want to do more for Jehovah, then do it.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.430
And there is plenty more to do.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.840
Recently, we installed a concrete batch plant right here on the site.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.840
This will help to streamline the next phases of the build.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:07.379
Later this year, we look forward to starting foundation work for the residents buildings in Parking Garage.

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:12.379
These new residences will allow us to house even more volunteers.

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.699
As the work at Ramapot gains momentum,

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:23.699
we pray that Jehovah continue to bless the efforts of all those who are offering themselves willingly

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:40.520
in support of this tremendous project.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.520
Thank you for your continued prayers and support.
