00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:08.509
Spiritual food is a gift from God, and so is our ability to read it in printed form or

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:12.509
to enjoy audio and video publications.

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.949
For the deaf, however, that same spiritual food is often out of reach.

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:24.230
To help us understand the challenges that most deaf people face, we've invited Brother

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.030
Bobby Dunbar to join us.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.670
He serves in translation services at World Headquarters and has spent over 30 years serving

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.990
in the Sign Language field.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.909
Welcome Bobby, we're happy to have you with us.

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:40.310
Thank you.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.030
First question for you, it's a personal one.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.990
What was your first language?

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.670
Both of my parents were deaf, so I grew up using Sign Language at home.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.869
You could say it was my first language and English as a second language for me.

00:00:54.869 --> 00:01:00.429
In the early days before there were Sign Language congregations, how were the spiritual

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:03.229
needs of the deaf cared for?

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.989
Our organization actually has a long history with deaf people.

00:01:06.989 --> 00:01:15.510
As far back as 1915, Brother John Gillespie, an anointed pilgrim brother, was seen signing

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.230
songs for deaf people at a convention in the United States.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.510
And since then, for many, many years, there's been interpreting at the meetings and assemblies.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.750
And where brothers didn't know Sign Language at times, they even wrote notes for the deaf

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.150
brothers to help them understand what was going on during the program.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.750
We do indeed appreciate those early signers, because I know they helped greatly when there

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.790
were no Sign Language congregations.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.189
Where was the first Sign Language congregation formed?

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.790
And how many Sign Language congregations are there worldwide, including groups?

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:55.230
In 1976, Korea was the first branch to establish a Sign Language congregation.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:01.230
And now there are more than 4,000 congregations in groups that conduct their meetings in Sign

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.030
Language.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.109
That's remarkable.

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:10.349
Would you please give us an idea of what the organization has accomplished down through

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.789
the years in order to assist deaf people to come to a knowledge of the truth?

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:23.750
Our website, which contains videos in Sign Language, Bible-based videos, in more than 80

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.909
Sign Languages, make Bible truths available to deaf people.

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:33.550
Many of these 80 Sign Languages have the watchtower available every month.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.349
Some of these Sign Languages actually have Bible books available.

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.509
And this has been a huge blessing to our deaf brothers and sisters.

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:46.430
In addition to this, the organization has provided an app for mobile devices that make

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.669
these videos very accessible in American Sign Language, and soon this app will be made

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:57.270
available to all the other 80 Sign Languages, so that they can carry around with them a

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.150
whole video library in a mobile phone or an tablet.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.669
That's remarkable.

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:11.110
But now some may ask, since most deaf people can see, why do they need videos with Sign

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.110
Language?

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.189
Why can't they just read the publications?

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:20.590
While it's true that some deaf people read very well, the vast majority of deaf people

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.150
really struggle to understand what they read and print it for.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.710
To give you an idea of the challenge that a person who is born deaf, the challenge that

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.870
he faces and learning to read well.

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:40.310
Just imagine I put you in a glass, soundproof booth, and I'm on the outside with a pencil

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:49.389
and paper, and I'm trying to teach you to read and write fluently in Greek or Chinese.

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:50.389
How far are you going to get?

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:53.830
I would get nowhere.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.590
You see, learning a language really depends much on hearing it.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.110
Just think of how a child learns language.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.189
He hears it first for many years, then he begins speaking it, and once he's fluent at

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:12.229
speaking the language, then he learns that these little black squiggles on the page represent

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:16.430
the sounds and the words that he already knows.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:22.189
But for deaf people, Sign Language used in our publications and at our meetings allows

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:29.110
them to learn and to flourish spiritually, to study, to have a meaningful ministry, to

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.470
participate in giving talks at meetings and conventions, and to become good teachers

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:35.470
of others.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.750
That's remarkable.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.550
But can Sign Language really teach what is found in the Bible?

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.310
Can it convey the understanding of the Scriptures?

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:52.230
For example, what's taught or what's spoken of in the Book of Revelation?

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:59.750
Sign Languages are actually very rich languages, and they excel at telling stories about people

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.949
and conveying emotions.

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:06.990
Actually, the Book of Revelation is very easy in Sign Language because Revelation is so

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.790
visual, and so the Bible comes alive in Sign Language.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.189
Would you like to see some examples?

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:16.860
Oh, yes.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:24.259
For example, we have the woman who approached Jesus and touched the friends of his garment,

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:37.850
and then we see his reaction, the blind man who was healed and regained his sight, the

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:46.290
beast of Revelation throwing down the harlot and having a rafter in your own eye.

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.569
I could even understand some of those video presentations.

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:54.889
Of course, since I already know about the accounts, but it's true, they're very powerful.

00:05:54.889 --> 00:06:01.569
Some in the congregations, the hearing congregations may be wondering, what can they do to assist

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:05.930
in getting the good news to deaf people everywhere?

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.649
If they meet a deaf person in the ministry or anywhere else, they can always direct them

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:18.009
to our website, and there's a good possibility that we have a video there in their Sign Language.

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:23.089
They can also direct the interest to the local Sign Language congregation or group.

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:29.370
One final question, Bobby, how do you personally feel about the progress that you've seen

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.410
in the Sign Language field worldwide?

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:40.410
I used to wonder how the good news was going to reach deaf people in places like Russia,

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:47.170
China, and India, but one by one, Jehovah has removed obstacles.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:59.889
And so, for example, today, there are more than 3,500 Jehovah's Witnesses who use Russian Sign Language

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:05.689
and worldwide, there are more than 24,000 deaf Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:12.610
We see all of this as a fulfillment of Bible prophecy and as an evidence of Jehovah's blessing.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:17.610
Thank you very much, Bobby, for giving us such insight into the world of the deaf

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:21.610
and also the way in which the good news is being carried to them.
