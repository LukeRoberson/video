WEBVTT

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:05.200
It is easy to admit that we are imperfect.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.199
But why is it that it is so painful

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:10.199
when we receive correction?

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:13.199
We all know the right attitude we should have

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:18.199
as outlined here in Psalm 141 and verse 5.

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:21.199
Shall we read that? Psalm 141 and verse 5.

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:22.199
It says,

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.199
Should the righteous one strike me,

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.199
it would be an act of loyal love.

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.199
Should he approve me?

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.200
It would be like oil on my head,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.200
which my head would never refuse.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.200
So maybe we are affected by a world review of discipline.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.200
One dictionary says,

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.200
Discipline is punishment to gain control.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.200
Another dictionary says,

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.200
Discipline is to make people obey

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.200
and to punish when they don't.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.200
It's so different from Jehovah God's point of view, isn't it?

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.200
In our text for today,

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.200
here in Hebrews,

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.200
it says that Jehovah invites us as his children.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.200
He says,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.200
In verse 5,

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.200
My son,

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.200
and in verse 6,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.200
For those whom Jehovah loves,

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.200
he disciplines.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.200
So it puts discipline in a very appealing light, doesn't it?

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.200
So the bottom line is,

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.200
discipline is a form of training.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.200
It's actually a very exciting process

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.200
because it helps us to get to know Jehovah even better.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.200
So what we would like to do now is,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.200
discuss three common reactions to discipline,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.200
I guess all of us have been guilty of them at one time or another.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.200
The first one is to feel very crushed,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.200
embarrassed,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.200
and we have this pain in our heart.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.200
And this is very natural.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.200
We see this even in little children

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.200
that they can feel very crushed

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.199
when they experience the displeasure of their parents,

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:14.199
and they react with a long face

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:16.199
and maybe even they start pounding.

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:20.199
But we ask Christians mature grown-ups,

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:22.199
we don't react that way, do we?

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:26.150
Now, the question is,

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.150
how do we react?

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.150
What should be the proper reaction?

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.150
First of all, do not be so overwhelmed by the emotion.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.150
Do not feel sorry for yourself.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.150
Another important point is,

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.150
it is painful

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:50.150
because the discipline exposes something very sensitive inside us.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.150
It is much better to respond positively

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.150
towards the discipline,

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.150
because the council is given for our benefit.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.150
Let us read the words here in Proverbs 15, verse 32.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.150
Proverbs 15 and verse 32.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.150
It says,

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.150
anyone refusing discipline

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.150
despises his life.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.150
Yes, it is a miserable life

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.150
while fighting our correction or discipline.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.150
And then it goes on to say,

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.150
but do ever listen to the reproof,

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.150
acquires understanding,

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.150
the fear of Jehovah

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.150
is a training in wisdom

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.150
and before glory there is humility.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.150
So let us learn the lessons

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.150
and be trained by Jehovah.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.150
Get the sense

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.150
before strong counsel comes

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.150
and before

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.150
some of the bad consequences come upon us.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.150
The second negative reaction we may have

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.150
is that of dismissing the council.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.150
Well, the council is wrong for me.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.150
It is inappropriate.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.150
I am not that bad.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.150
And the person who counseled me does not see the full picture.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.150
And by the way,

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.150
they can improve in the way of giving counsel.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.150
Now, usually when we have this reaction,

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.149
it is because the council exposed

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:19.149
that we love what is wrong.

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:22.149
And we cover that

00:04:22.149 --> 00:04:25.149
by accusing the bearer of the message

00:04:25.149 --> 00:04:27.149
as unqualified.

00:04:27.149 --> 00:04:29.149
The reality is,

00:04:29.149 --> 00:04:31.149
we don't see the big picture.

00:04:31.149 --> 00:04:34.149
Well, maybe we don't want to see the big picture.

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:38.149
And could it be that we rely on our own understanding

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:41.149
instead of Jehovah's view?

00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:43.149
How about having this attitude

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:46.149
here in Proverbs 25 verse 12

00:04:46.149 --> 00:04:49.149
as an attitude towards the counselor

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:52.149
when he gives us counsel and advice?

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:56.149
Proverbs 25 verse 12.

00:04:56.149 --> 00:04:59.149
It says like an earring of gold

00:04:59.149 --> 00:05:02.149
and an ornament of fine gold

00:05:02.149 --> 00:05:07.149
is a wise reprover to the receptive ear.

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:10.149
So we can dignify the process

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:14.149
by adorning the bearer of the message,

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:15.149
the counselor,

00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:18.149
with gold as it were.

00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:22.149
So we need to respond with love,

00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:24.149
truly see God's love

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:26.149
and love the correction

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:28.149
and the discipline we have.

00:05:28.149 --> 00:05:30.149
Now, the third reaction,

00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:32.149
we may be irritated

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:36.149
or angered by the council.

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:38.149
Who do they think they are?

00:05:38.149 --> 00:05:40.149
Maybe it's a peer.

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:43.149
Maybe it is someone in our opinion

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:45.149
that is in the lower status than we are.

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:47.149
They have not been in the truth as long.

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:49.149
They do not know as much.

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:50.149
They are younger.

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:52.149
Whatever reason we might have.

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:54.149
We might look down on them

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:57.149
because they are not good teachers.

00:05:57.149 --> 00:05:59.149
The question is,

00:05:59.149 --> 00:06:02.149
are we willing to admit

00:06:02.149 --> 00:06:04.149
that Jehovah knows better?

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:07.149
That it is really Jehovah talking to us.

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:11.149
And they may be a very important reason

00:06:11.149 --> 00:06:14.149
why Jehovah selected that person

00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:16.149
or that agency to come to us

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:18.149
and give us the advice.

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:20.149
Now, the scripture for our day text,

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:22.149
the unhebrus 12 verse 5,

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:26.149
it says that we must not despise

00:06:26.149 --> 00:06:28.149
Jehovah's council.

00:06:28.149 --> 00:06:30.149
It says we must not give up

00:06:30.149 --> 00:06:33.149
when we are corrected by him.

00:06:33.149 --> 00:06:34.149
Now, we may say,

00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:36.149
well, if Jehovah comes to me

00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:38.149
and he gives me this council directly,

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:40.149
of course I will listen,

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:43.149
but isn't this Jehovah's way

00:06:43.149 --> 00:06:46.149
of speaking to us directly?

00:06:46.149 --> 00:06:49.149
Think of the case of David.

00:06:49.149 --> 00:06:53.149
When Nathan came to him,

00:06:53.149 --> 00:06:55.149
David did not rebel.

00:06:55.149 --> 00:06:59.149
He was not angry with Nathan.

00:06:59.149 --> 00:07:01.149
He accepted the council

00:07:01.149 --> 00:07:03.149
and he said,

00:07:03.149 --> 00:07:06.149
I have sinned against Jehovah.

00:07:06.149 --> 00:07:08.149
So what is the point?

00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:10.149
Do not dismiss council

00:07:10.149 --> 00:07:15.149
except the council wholeheartedly.

00:07:15.149 --> 00:07:17.149
So in summary,

00:07:17.149 --> 00:07:20.149
see the big picture.

00:07:20.149 --> 00:07:24.660
When we are part of Jehovah's family

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.660
as we hopefully are,

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.660
all of us will receive much council,

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.660
much advice,

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:35.660
all the advice,

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.660
all the council that comes from Jehovah

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:40.660
is for our good.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.660
Jehovah is shaping us individually

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.660
to become the kind of person

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.660
he wants us to become.

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.660
So this is not really a discussion

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.660
about the need of discipline,

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.660
but it is a discussion of our attitude

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.660
toward discipline.

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.660
Paul's words in Hebrews 12

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.660
are taken from Proverbs,

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.660
and in Proverbs chapter 3,

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.660
it discusses discipline,

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.660
but there towards the end of the discussion

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:12.660
in Proverbs 3 verse 18,

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.660
it gives this beautiful invitation

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.660
to all of us.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.660
Proverbs 3 and verse 18,

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:21.660
it says about discipline,

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.660
it is a tree of life

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.660
to those who take hold of it

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:29.660
and those who keep firmhold of it

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.659
will be called happy.

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:36.659
So joyfully accept the council,

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:40.659
view it as an embrace from Jehovah God.
