00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.860
What would you do if you were tempted or pressured to commit some sort of wrongdoing?

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:12.339
There are many people in the world who would give in to the temptation or the pressure,

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.179
especially if they felt that they could benefit in some way, and they thought no one would find out about it.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.260
But would doing that really contribute to a person's joy?

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.660
In the previous talk, we saw a dramatization of a brother named Ben.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.780
At first, he chose to accept a promotion at work that put him under great stress.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:39.740
Let's take another look at him in that position and see how he handles things when his boss

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:42.619
pressures him to be dishonest.

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.950
Hey Ben, looks like you forgot to sign off from the job water.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.479
Actually, these failed that quality inspection, remember?

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.479
Yeah, but I like two tenths of a point.

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.920
Yeah, I already talked Steve about replacing the components.

00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:10.239
And we're going to get that order adjusted and I'll have a new one for you on your desk tomorrow afternoon.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.420
Ben, there's no time for that.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.500
This is a huge account.

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.420
If you don't sign off on this, you'd be hurting the whole company.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:26.180
What?

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:28.930
Victor, I'm...

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.650
I'm not sure that I'm really comfortable

00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:37.890
bypassing the inspection when...

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.049
Ben, I'm not asking you to tell some big lie.

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:43.650
Okay, this is a technicality.

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:50.370
Remember, a good quarter means good bonuses for everyone, including you.

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:56.579
I didn't want to do it.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.819
But the last thing that Lisa and I needed was for me to lose my job.

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.789
I really didn't have a choice.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.270
They can't believe you.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.969
And they might not...

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:22.129
I kept telling myself that it was no big deal.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.810
All lies are bad, even new ones.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.610
One lie leads to another and they cause much harm.

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:39.789
It's simple, right?

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.770
Jehovah's people always tell the truth.

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.569
Did you hear what Ben said?

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:55.169
I kept telling myself that it was no big deal.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.930
But if that were really true, then why was he so uncomfortable about what he had done?

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:05.330
It is because wrongdoing does not lead to true joy.

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.050
Ben's conscience was not clean.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.289
It was telling him Jehovah's people always tell the truth.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.330
And what is the conscience?

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:18.689
A young boy was asked that question and he said,

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.050
when you're good, you don't even know you have it.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.210
But when you're bad, it hurts.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.610
Another child said that in her head there was a green light and a red light.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.650
And that when she was told to do something that she knew was wrong,

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.330
the red light would flash.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.289
Well, they both had the right idea.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.330
Our conscience is our inner sense of right and wrong that Jehovah instilled in us.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:50.050
And the Bible says it is like a law written in the human heart.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.889
Speaking of people in general, look at what Romans 2.15 says as it explains the function of the

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:01.009
conscience. That's Romans 2.15.

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:08.449
They are the very ones who demonstrate the matter of the law to be written in their hearts,

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.969
while their conscience is bearing witness with them.

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.730
And by their own thoughts, they are being accused or even excused.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:24.689
Jehovah gave us a conscience so that we can evaluate any situation that arises in life,

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.730
make a right choice and then judge ourselves afterward on the choice we made.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:36.449
If we allow ourselves to do what we know is wrong, our conscience will surely strike us.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.930
Then if we repeatedly ignore our conscience, it will malfunction and become insensitive.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.889
And it will not recognize dangers that could damage our relationship with Jehovah.

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.370
The first time a person does something he knows he should not do, his conscience may prick him

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:00.610
and he may feel guilty. But if he does it again and again, his conscience will gradually fail

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:07.490
to respond and he may get involved in even more serious wrongdoing, seemingly small compromises

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:13.889
often lead to larger ones and larger compromises further distance people from the happy God.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:21.490
And that leads to feelings of worthlessness and heartache, whereas a clean conscience

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:28.850
that results from obeying Jehovah brings us self-respect, personal dignity, and real joy.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.050
Now, how can we safeguard our conscience so that it is always clean?

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.410
By studying Bible principles and meditating on how to apply them,

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:45.490
so that when we are faced with important decisions, we will know how to respond in a way

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:52.209
that will contribute to our joy. We have to sensitize our conscience by learning and loving

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:58.769
Jehovah's view of what is right and what is wrong. And being convinced that living in harmony with

00:05:58.769 --> 00:06:04.850
his standards is the best way of life. And that is how the Psalmist David felt. If you'd like to

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:10.529
turn to Psalm 19 verse 8, Psalm 19 8, he wrote,

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:19.089
The orders from Jehovah are righteous, causing the heart to rejoice. The commandment of Jehovah is clean,

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:27.970
making the eyes shine. So maintaining a clean conscience in all areas of our daily life

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:33.889
will bring us joy in our use of alcohol, in business dealings, within our chainment choices,

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:41.089
and in our dealings with the opposite sex. And when we have a clean conscience as Jehovah's people,

00:06:41.089 --> 00:06:47.410
we are not ashamed to give a witness to others. As the Apostle Paul wrote at 2 Corinthians 1-12,

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:53.009
we can boast that our conscience bears witness that we have conducted ourselves in the world

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:59.730
with holiness and godly sincerity. It times it takes real courage to be honest,

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:06.129
and to face whatever consequences may come our way. As you watch the following dramatization,

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.370
see how Ben benefits from being honest.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.279
Do you have to take a quick look? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:42.819
You need a hand? No, I'm good. What happened, guys? We got to do something up.

00:07:53.839 --> 00:07:59.839
Did... I'm pretty sure that I would just say it stopped working.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:17.300
Whatever you do, don't tell Victor what happened. We just got this set up last month.

00:08:18.259 --> 00:08:20.500
Why would it just stop working? It could happen.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:32.100
You can actually smell the coffee. I'll talk to Victor. Don't throw yourself under the bus, man.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.659
We'll help you get this cleaned up. No one will have to know.

00:08:35.379 --> 00:08:40.100
This is one of the most expensive units in the shop. You take the blame?

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:49.730
And you just make yourself look bad. No, it's okay. It was a mistake. I'll explain it.

00:08:50.690 --> 00:09:22.269
We need to get this back online. In the end, I think Victor actually appreciated my honesty,

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:33.889
and he wasn't the only one. Mark had some questions, and we had a great discussion.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:46.370
This time, instead of his conscience troubling him, Ben had a real peace of mind.

00:09:46.929 --> 00:09:51.889
He also gained the trust and respect of others. How can you have a clean conscience?

00:09:52.690 --> 00:10:00.610
By being determined, as Hebrews 13-18 says, to conduct yourselves honestly in all things,

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:03.730
whether other humans are aware of your good conduct or not.

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:10.610
Then, you can sleep each night with the satisfaction of knowing Jehovah is pleased with you.

00:10:11.409 --> 00:10:19.169
As they say, there is no pillow so soft as a clean conscience. It rewards us with peace of mind and joy.

00:10:19.169 --> 00:10:24.129
Besides a clean conscience, what else brings true joy?

00:10:24.129 --> 00:10:30.929
Listen, as Brother William Mallenfant, the helper to the teaching committee considers the next talk of the symposium.

00:10:30.929 --> 00:10:35.090
What contributes to joy? Meaningful work.
