00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:07.290
This book of the law should not depart from your mouth,

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.289
and you must read it in an undertone day and night

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:15.289
in order to observe carefully all that is written in it,

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:18.289
for then your way will be successful,

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.289
and then you will act wisely.

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.289
The Bible is enjoyed in many different formats,

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:33.369
one of which is the audio edition of the New World Translation.

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:36.369
Good news, according to Matthew.

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:38.369
But how is it produced?

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:41.369
Let's take a closer look.

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:44.369
When we first heard that the governing body wanted

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:47.369
to record the revised edition of the New World Translation,

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:51.369
I think all of us knew that it was going to be a big job.

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:53.369
The narrator is one voice,

00:00:53.369 --> 00:01:00.369
and all the other characters are a different voice.

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:03.369
It's not a dramatic Bible reading,

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:06.370
but it's a reading with a high level of realism.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.370
There's no music, no sound effects, just voices.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.370
We were surprised to find out how many characters

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.370
there were in the Bible. Well, the Bible is a really big book.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.370
I don't think any of us realized how big of a job it would be.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.370
This is not a little project. This is huge.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.670
The research really is one of the items

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.670
that are a very fundamental basic.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.670
They are very important to get effects together.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.670
Bible is true life,

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.670
but it's what really happened to real people.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.670
We had to break down who the voices were.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.670
And then we had to give each character a unique name

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.670
to identify him. If he's not named in the Bible,

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.670
we have to just give them descriptions

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.670
that are in the context like third Jew or first in the crowd.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.670
We're given a room, a fair-sized room,

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.670
and we used it to make a list of all of the characters

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.670
in all four gospels.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.670
We began with a book of Matthew,

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.669
and we had to determine the parallel accounts

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.669
between the different gospel writers.

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:15.669
You'll have to use the same voice for a character.

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:17.669
If he appears in one book,

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:19.669
he needs to be the same character in the other books.

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:22.669
Like in Matthew 21,

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:26.669
we have this report where Matthew simply says,

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:29.669
well, the disciples said the victory has with it.

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:31.669
But who are the disciples?

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:33.669
Did they all say it at the same time?

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:35.669
So if you check in Mark, for example,

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:38.669
Mark is very specific. He says,

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:40.669
Peter said the victory has with it.

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:44.669
The art department took those maps and charts in the appendix

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:47.669
and blew them up into poster size for us

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:50.669
as we were deciding who said what and where they were

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:51.669
and how to name the characters.

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:53.669
It was very helpful to have that.

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:56.669
That gets put into a database what kind of attributes

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:59.669
they have age, where they were from,

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:04.669
what kind of traits they were expressing in their quotations.

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:08.669
When the Bible talks about Jehovah speaking,

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:11.669
well, was it really Jehovah himself who spoke?

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:15.669
Well, something we know that at least at three occasions

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:18.669
it was Jehovah who spoke. This was when Jesus was on earth.

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:20.669
We compiled most of the research

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:23.669
and then it was forwarded on to writing research.

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:26.669
We have a large library here in Bethel

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:30.669
that is focusing especially on biblical subjects.

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:32.669
And we are using this quite a bit

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:35.669
because we need to make sure that what we say is solid.

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:38.669
We are people for Jehovah

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:41.669
and everything we say is based on the Bible.

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:44.669
We don't want to read too much into Bible accounts

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:48.669
and we don't want to read it in a way that steers incorrectly.

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:53.330
To start with, who's in Bethel?

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.330
We have an audition bank here in an audio video.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.330
We poured through hundreds of auditions.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.330
We had a brother from Africa.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.330
We audition over the internet.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.330
He's sitting there reading into a mic.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.330
I'm watching him.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.330
By the time we tallied all of the characters

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.330
for the entire Bible, we realized we had about a thousand characters.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.329
So, a thousand voices that will need to find

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:22.379
there was a reading seminar at which we were taught

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:24.379
every aspect of reading.

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:26.379
And that was very effective because

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:29.379
it reminded us of a lot of things

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:31.379
dos and don'ts for effective reading.

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:33.379
It really gave me the confidence and understanding

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:35.379
that but I think I can do this.

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:37.379
Some of the roles are very small.

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:40.379
Those short, very short passages

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:46.379
those one sentence lines that we would call a person in for

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:49.379
were some of the hardest to coach.

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:52.379
When I initially was asked to participate

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:55.379
in the Bible reading, I was so excited.

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:57.379
And then I thought it was one line

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:59.379
and I thought, okay, well, it won't be too bad.

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:00.379
It'll be easy.

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:03.379
And then so I listened to the Bible reading seminar

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:07.379
and really helped me to take it more seriously.

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:11.379
We would even ask the readers to study this over.

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:15.379
You only have one sentence, but study all about this character.

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:17.379
I read the chapter.

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:21.379
I read the insight book and I realized that

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:24.379
this is more than just saying one line.

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:27.379
What we have found is that it's a good idea

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:31.379
to provide the reader with a script that has been customized.

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:33.379
I have the word written out phonetically

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:35.379
so that you know better how to pronounce it.

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:36.379
I would say Solomon.

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:38.379
Solomon, who's he?

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:39.379
That kind of thing.

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:42.379
So anyway, they help you pronounce Solomon.

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:44.379
And they were very careful to make

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:46.379
the pronunciation was accurate

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:49.379
and it would be consistent and accurate

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:51.379
all the way through the Bible reading

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:53.379
from begin to end.

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:57.379
So when the character comes in, we try to help them

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:59.379
to kind of think about the context.

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:00.379
Of course, they've already done that

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:02.379
in their own research and practice.

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:04.379
But a little bit more about maybe the motive

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:05.379
of the character.

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:08.379
How would they have felt in this particular instance?

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:10.379
How would they say this line?

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:11.379
But we also want to make sure

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:13.379
the brothers and sisters feel really comfortable.

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:17.379
And it often takes a long time to get them to relax.

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:19.379
In the control room,

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:23.379
there are basically three roles and the reader.

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:26.379
The follower is responsible to make sure

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:28.379
that all of the content is there,

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:30.379
to make sure that no words are missing.

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:32.379
During the recording, the audio engineer

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:35.379
is listening for anything that will distract the listeners,

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:38.379
stomach noises, or a shirt noise,

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:40.379
if the brother's wearing suspenders.

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:42.379
The coach is responsible for the quality of teaching.

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:46.379
By love watching the coach try to get the right emotion

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:47.379
out of the reader.

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:49.379
So then you might read a line and he'll say,

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:51.379
can you say that again with a smile?

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:54.379
And it's amazing because then it sounds more joyful.

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:56.379
And then once you capture the emotion,

00:06:56.379 --> 00:06:57.379
then it naturally comes out.

00:06:57.379 --> 00:07:00.379
You're not trying to copy what he's told you to say.

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:03.379
What we have usually a person do is start with one emotion

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:05.379
that you're sad,

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:08.379
and then add each emotion on top

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:11.379
that ends up getting a very complex delivery

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:13.379
of a line.

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:16.379
There's so many possible ways to say one line.

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:18.379
I didn't even realize how many.

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:22.379
You think you know how the character said it

00:07:22.379 --> 00:07:29.019
and then the coach will give you a suggestion.

00:07:29.019 --> 00:07:32.019
So the editing process actually begins during the recording.

00:07:32.019 --> 00:07:34.019
And then when we get done recording,

00:07:34.019 --> 00:07:38.019
perhaps a chapter will take down the best takes of every verse

00:07:38.019 --> 00:07:40.019
because the reader and the coach can then listen back

00:07:40.019 --> 00:07:42.019
and see, okay, do we like how it sounds?

00:07:42.019 --> 00:07:45.019
We use professional software to do the editing.

00:07:45.019 --> 00:07:47.019
And that means we do all the spacing that's needed.

00:07:47.019 --> 00:07:49.019
We pull in all the characters for a specific chapter

00:07:49.019 --> 00:07:52.019
because we record each voice individually.

00:07:52.019 --> 00:07:54.019
It's not a group of people around the microphone

00:07:54.019 --> 00:07:56.019
having the conversation.

00:07:56.019 --> 00:07:58.019
So each character is done.

00:07:58.019 --> 00:08:01.019
And then if there's multiple voices in a chapter,

00:08:01.019 --> 00:08:03.019
then we pull them all together.

00:08:03.019 --> 00:08:06.019
Once we started editing together these chapters,

00:08:06.019 --> 00:08:09.019
beautiful artwork of truth

00:08:09.019 --> 00:08:12.019
as you're seeing like the context, jump, jump out

00:08:12.019 --> 00:08:17.019
and for us to then feel it and move us as, you know,

00:08:17.019 --> 00:08:20.019
the reader of God's Word, a hero of God's Word.

00:08:20.019 --> 00:08:27.100
The comment I've heard over and over again is

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:32.100
it's brought the Bible to life in my mind and heart.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:39.100
And it has encouraged us to meditate deeper into God's Word.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.100
Having the different characters read the voices

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:47.100
is going to be such a comfort to all of us.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.100
I think that this is really going to make Bible reading exciting.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:55.100
So now the Bible is alive and what a difference it makes.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:58.100
I think they're going to love it.
