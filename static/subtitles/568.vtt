00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.459
Have you ever been in a situation where you felt especially anxious?

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:17.780
Vulnerable even fearful and you needed your closest friends to stand by you to strengthen you and encourage you

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:20.539
Very likely we have experienced that

00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:27.539
Think of this situation. You're out in the field ministry with your friends working in a quiet neighborhood

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.060
You can see your friends up and down the street calling house to house as you are

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:38.659
All of a sudden the police arrive they single you out and tell you that you need to go to the police station with them

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.420
You look around for your friends and they've all disappeared

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.939
They've left you alone to deal with the situation. How would that make you feel?

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:49.859
Disappointed discouraged

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.219
Maybe even a bit angered

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:58.060
Well now we get the sense of how Jesus must have felt there in the Garden of Cassemony

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:04.000
When mob of his enemies came to arrest him and haul him away for trial and

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.019
Where were his eleven and closest friends?

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.620
Well as today's text says they all abandoned him and fled and

00:01:13.019 --> 00:01:18.019
Yet just a few hours earlier those same men had vowed to him that they would rather die than

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:21.459
De-sert their lord

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:23.980
Well, Jesus was human and he has

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.980
Feelings just like us even though he could perfectly keep them in check

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:32.180
Of course, Jesus did have an advantage

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.459
He had known that it was prophesied over 500 years in advance that something like that was going to happen to him

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:42.099
Let's read the prophecy. It's in Zachariah chapter 13

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.780
Zachariah 13 and verse seven

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:52.500
Jehovah had this written oh soared awake against my shepherd

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.340
Against the man who is my companion

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.219
Declaraged Jehovah of armies strike the shepherd and let the flock be scattered

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:09.319
Well as a result look at what Jesus had told the eleven on their way from the upper room in Jerusalem to

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:15.560
Cassemony as he quoted that very prophecy to them. This is in Matthew chapter 26 and

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:18.139
verse 31

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:20.139
Matthew 26

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:23.060
Verse 31 it reports

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.939
Then Jesus said to them all of you will be stumbled in connection with me on this night

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.180
For it is written I will strike the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered about

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.860
Now we can speculate about what the apostles were thinking as they stepped into the shadows to flee

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.659
Are they thinking well the Lord said this was going to happen? So I guess we're just doing our duty

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:49.460
Probably not

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:55.740
More than likely it's logical to suppose that they were so terrified that the only thing they could think of was a

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.740
Quickest way to escape and to save themselves

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:06.740
Well, whatever they were thinking on that occasion the eleven did not live up to the proverb that says a true friend shows love at all

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.819
Times and as a brother who is born for times of distress

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:13.139
Proverbs 17 17

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:21.939
Now can you think of a Bible principle that would help each of us to be that brother or that sister who is born

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:29.900
For times of distress when one of our friends is especially anxious or vulnerable or fearful

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:36.939
Interestingly two years before that traumatic incidents in the Garden of Cassemony Jesus had taught a wonderful rule

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:43.180
That if always followed would prevent any of us from ever letting down a friend who is in need of our support

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:48.219
He taught this in the sermon on the Mount and it is quoted by both of the gospel writers

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:52.340
Who recorded his sermon? Let's take a look at Matthew's

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.180
Account of it in Matthew chapter 7

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.099
and verse 12

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.580
Matthew 712

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:04.330
He wrote

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:10.090
All things therefore that you want men to do to you you also must do to them

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:20.930
Here's how Luke worded it just as you want men to do to you do the same way to them and that really is a golden rule for every day life

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.970
Just as pure gold never tarnishes

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:31.970
The value of the golden rule has never diminished and likely it's the most famous rule ever stated, but also

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.329
It is one that's easily forgotten at times now. How can we apply it?

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:40.889
Basically by just taking two steps first of all think

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.610
If I were in the other person's situation

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:46.290
How would I feel?

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:55.569
What would I need? What would I want and then second takes some positive action to do something good and merciful for that other person

00:04:56.209 --> 00:05:00.850
It just starts with sharpening our sensitivity to the feelings of others

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:08.850
Now in that Jesus is an excellent example to imitate because on many occasions and other many circumstances

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.610
Jesus shared in the feelings of those who were suffering in some way

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.410
First of all, he was sensitive to their needs. He felt their pain in his heart and

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:23.649
Second, he was moved to show compassion and he took the initiative to help people

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:26.850
He reached out to those who were in distress

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:29.569
Give you a couple of examples

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:36.290
For instance in Mark chapter one it shows us of how Jesus was moved to relieve people's suffering

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:40.889
Because it tells of a time when Jesus was approached by a man who was full of leprosy

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.769
Now Jesus knew it was unlawful for that man even to be there

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.930
But Jesus was so deeply moved that instead of turning the man away

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.329
Jesus did the

00:05:51.329 --> 00:05:56.810
Unimaginable be touched him and after that one touch the disease that had made the man an hour

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.930
Cast was gone

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.610
You see Jesus knew of the heartless view that the rabbinic leaders had toward lepers

00:06:04.209 --> 00:06:07.329
Jesus though had real compassion for people who were suffering

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:14.370
Another example in Luke chapter 7 tells us of how Jesus was moved to dispel people's grief

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.930
It tells of when Jesus saw a funeral procession

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:25.569
Now the circumstances were especially tragic because a widow's only son had just died her only means of support

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:29.970
And Jesus Gays was fixed on the grief stricken mother

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:36.689
And he told her to stop weeping weeping and then he spoke to the lifeless body and the young man came to life

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.689
None of the religious leaders had ever done that for the people

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.290
What have we learned from these accounts about the Christ

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:51.250
Well in each case did you notice the connection between Jesus compassion and his action

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:55.810
He could not see the plight of others without being moved with pity

00:06:56.529 --> 00:07:00.850
And he could not feel such pity without acting on it

00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:06.689
So when Jesus did those things that really helps us to appreciate

00:07:07.329 --> 00:07:10.290
The attitude that we have to have toward those

00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:15.089
That are close to us and who are going through difficult situations in life

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.970
If you turn to John chapter 15 now

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.649
We'll see the ultimate example of living by the golden rule

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:24.290
John 15

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:27.410
Verse 13 something Jesus said about himself

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:35.089
No one has loved greater than this that someone should surrender his life in behalf of his friends

00:07:36.689 --> 00:07:39.889
Now thinking again of Jesus that night in gassemony

00:07:40.689 --> 00:07:47.329
It is encouraging to read something that John included in his account just turn the page to John chapter 16

00:07:48.129 --> 00:07:49.970
And look at verse 32

00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:57.839
Look the hour is coming indeed it has come when each one of you will be scattered to his own house

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.959
And you will leave me alone. That's what Jesus told

00:08:01.839 --> 00:08:03.839
The 11 faithful apostles

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.240
But then he said

00:08:06.399 --> 00:08:10.079
But I am not alone because the father is with me

00:08:11.279 --> 00:08:19.120
So Jesus sensed his father's keen interest in him that Jehovah was not remote or distant and had not forgotten

00:08:19.439 --> 00:08:21.439
His beloved son

00:08:21.439 --> 00:08:29.199
That feeling of closeness with God certainly strengthened Jesus during those moments when no human was around to help him

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:36.799
Well, we too can always be sure that our best friend Jehovah will stand by us support us

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.600
Encourage us and strengthen us

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:43.200
To face each day's cares and apprehensions

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.159
Whenever we find ourselves in an anxious

00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:50.720
Vulnerable or fearful situation of life
