00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.589
Each year in this new millennium, pressures on health care systems mount.

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:19.589
The growing number of patients, particularly the elderly, challenges health care providers' ability to meet patient needs with available resources.

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:29.589
At the same time, legal and ethical voices increasingly advocate that patients be permitted a greater role in choosing their treatment.

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:34.590
These developments especially affect one major sector of health care.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:42.590
There's a growing concern on the part of physicians that are approached to blood transfusion needs to be re-evaluated.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:49.590
Today, at least 80% of the patients would strongly favor not to have blood transfusions.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:58.590
News headlines show this. Both physicians and patients are faced with transfusion complications, supply shortages,

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.590
and concerns about blood product safety.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:11.590
As just one example, the World Health Organization calculates that around the globe unsafe transfusion and injection practices

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.590
cause some 5 million hepatitis C virus infections each year.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:26.590
Increased efforts by national health care systems to achieve a safer blood supply have caused the cost of blood to spiral upward.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:33.590
Two years ago, it cost us about 63 euros per unit of transfused blood. It now cost us 142.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.590
Treating transfusion-related side effects has incurred additional costs.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:48.590
These costs which are indirect and delayed are enormous and clearly would raise the cost of the unit of blood substantially.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:58.590
The same holds true for compensation totaling billions of euros or dollars that have been paid to recipients of tainted blood and to their surviving families.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:09.539
As society faces these issues, transfusion risks and costs, is there a better approach?

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.539
Might transfusion alternative health care meet patient needs and rights?

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:25.240
Professors Ernshaw and Hetzr and countless other clinicians have responded to the requests of patients at a parent's of minors.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:31.240
Consider three examples of complex surgeries performed without transfusion.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.240
Open Heart Surgery is consistently a major challenge.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:44.240
In Berlin, Professor Roland Hetzr explains why he had to operate on the tiny heart of a 10-month-old baby girl.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:51.240
This child has a cultural heart defect which is relatively rare.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:03:04.240
It means there is a direct communication between the left reticle and the right atrium which creates a continuous abnormal flow between the left heart and the right heart.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:14.409
The defect was corrected with a heart arrest time of only 26 minutes and the blood flow normalized.

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:21.409
No transfusion was given. In fact, there was virtually no blood loss.

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.409
Another example.

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:29.409
Liver surgery usually involves considerable donor transfusion.

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:45.009
In Jena, Germany, at the University Clinic, Professor Johannes Schela here removes the cancerous portion of the liver from an elderly man.

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:54.009
No donor blood was given. And 18 hours later, the patient is chatting with the doctor in the ICU.

00:03:54.009 --> 00:04:06.610
Now an example of orthopedic surgery. In London, Royal College Fellow Peter Ernshaw successfully performs a total knee replacement on an elderly woman.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.610
Typically, a high blood loss operation.

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:22.399
All three successful operations were accomplished by surgical teams committed to respecting the patients or parents preference that donor blood not be given.

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:38.399
Were these experimental operations by three pioneering surgeons? There are more than 100,000 physicians and surgeons in 150 countries who routinely treat patients without donor transfusion. Some experts feel...

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:46.399
Every anesthesiologist and surgeon should be interested in blood conservation strategies because it's good patient care.

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:57.399
When physicians who turn to transfusion alternative healthcare are asked why, they often cite as a major reason, respect for their patient's decision.

00:04:57.399 --> 00:05:02.740
Professor Blumberg, director of a transfusion medicine unit and blood bank.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:11.740
Well, I think they're a growing number of patients who are interested in being treated with either no transfusion or the minimum amount of transfusion possible.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.740
And there are some folks who strictly don't want to be transfused under any circumstances.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:27.740
Another area motivating physicians and surgeons to change their approach is the growing evidence of inconsistent practices leading to unnecessary transfusions.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:39.660
Everyone concerned with improving healthcare or protecting the individual patient should consider some revealing studies on blood use.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.660
First, the Sanguis study.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:54.660
As part of a concerted action by the European Commission Medical Research Program, transfusion rates in 43 major teaching hospitals across Europe were analyzed.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:06.660
The ramifications of the Sanguis study are staggering. For the same type of operation, there were enormous variations in the number of units transfused depending on the hospital.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:13.769
In 1998, in Brussels, Professor Baal published a follow-up study.

00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:20.769
All types of hospitals were included in the Belgian Biomed Transusion Study for surgery.

00:06:20.769 --> 00:06:25.769
And we found exactly the same range of variability.

00:06:25.769 --> 00:06:35.769
So we are left with the conclusion that variability implies that a lot of these blood transfusion components are being given unnecessarily.

00:06:35.769 --> 00:06:40.769
A comparison of the two studies revealed another significant fact.

00:06:40.769 --> 00:06:47.769
There were two centers which participated both in the Sanguis study and in the Biomed study.

00:06:47.769 --> 00:06:50.769
Based on their findings in the Sanguis study,

00:06:50.769 --> 00:06:56.769
they had somehow managed to reduce their blood consumption for major surgery.

00:06:56.769 --> 00:07:04.769
The mortality was the same before and after the changes the hospitals' day was shorter.

00:07:04.769 --> 00:07:09.769
The new procedures they adopted weren't very difficult to adopt.

00:07:09.769 --> 00:07:18.769
Although they took time and took a considerable educational effort, but they didn't result in increased costs.

00:07:18.769 --> 00:07:26.769
Soon after, in Canada, Dr. A. Baal did a large-scale study of critically ill patients in intensive care.

00:07:26.769 --> 00:07:29.769
Professor Spahn evaluates the results.

00:07:29.769 --> 00:07:38.769
I talk about the A. Baal paper where they showed more than 800 patients that less transfusion results in an improved outcome.

00:07:38.769 --> 00:07:47.769
The obvious conclusion is that unnecessary transfusion translates into unnecessary labor and unnecessary cost.

00:07:47.769 --> 00:07:56.769
Besides patient demand and over transfusion, many physicians cite as motivation to implement transfusion alternative health care,

00:07:56.769 --> 00:07:59.769
the desire to avoid medical risks.

00:07:59.769 --> 00:08:05.269
There's the risk of bacterial contamination in a stored unit of blood.

00:08:05.269 --> 00:08:15.269
Bacterial contamination, whether occurring at donation or subsequently from improper storage, can cause infections having fatal consequences.

00:08:16.269 --> 00:08:23.269
In another arena, despite improved testing, viral infections continue to pose a serious threat.

00:08:23.269 --> 00:08:27.269
Experts are concerned about what the future holds.

00:08:27.269 --> 00:08:33.269
Will existing viruses mutate and produce disease?

00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:36.269
There's no reason to believe that they want.

00:08:36.269 --> 00:08:42.269
The problem with contamination of transfusions always seems to be one step ahead of us.

00:08:42.269 --> 00:08:49.269
In addition, blood transfusion induces a immunosuppressive state with the recipient,

00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:58.269
and that results in increased postoperative infections as well as earlier and more often recurrence of tumors.

00:08:58.269 --> 00:09:11.269
We've estimated that approximately in the United States, we can expect that 10 to 50,000 patients a year may be dying from transfusion and minim modulation related causes.

00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:17.269
Likely, the most surprising and least recognized medical risk is human error.

00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:23.269
Giving blood of an incompatible type can cause a reaction ranging from mild to fatal.

00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:28.269
Professor Spence, a director of surgical education, acknowledges.

00:09:28.269 --> 00:09:31.269
We can mix the blood up and cause catastrophe.

00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:34.269
Patients have died and do die from getting the wrong blood.

00:09:34.269 --> 00:09:44.269
In fact, reports indicate that human error causes up to one half of all transfusion-trigger deaths.

00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:56.269
In the light of such realities, patient decision, unnecessary transfusion, medical risks, as well as shrinking blood inventories and soaring blood costs.

00:09:56.269 --> 00:10:01.269
Professor Vanderlinden summarizes what many experts have concluded.

00:10:01.269 --> 00:10:10.269
In view of the potential for a better patient care and a reduced ill-care cost, blood conservation is not an option.

00:10:10.269 --> 00:10:12.269
It's a must.

00:10:12.269 --> 00:10:17.269
The good news is that safe, practical, and cost-effective therapies already exist.

00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:23.269
The best medical care can be delivered without the use of allergenic blood.

00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:30.269
There are some very simple, very cheap things you can do to help the majority of people, and this could be done in the smallest of hospitals.

00:10:30.269 --> 00:10:40.269
Blood conservation is a very simple method which makes things rather smooth, less expensive, and with a better outlook for the patient.

00:10:40.269 --> 00:10:51.269
The transfusion alternative techniques used by these surgical teams can be grouped within one of three basic principles or pillars.

00:10:51.269 --> 00:10:55.269
The first is tolerance of anemia.

00:10:55.269 --> 00:11:01.269
Racing through the arteries, red cells carry life-sustaining oxygen to all parts of the body.

00:11:01.269 --> 00:11:07.269
The anemic patient has a low number of red cells in relation to his blood volume.

00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:17.269
If a person suffers extensive blood loss during surgery or as the result of an accident, the body can tolerate anemia to a considerable degree.

00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:21.269
Professor Moore acknowledged pioneer in trauma surgery.

00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:30.269
Studies have shown physiologically that the human being could tolerate much lower hemoglobin levels than previously assumed safe.

00:11:30.269 --> 00:11:39.269
The medical community is starting to realize that tolerance of a significant anemia is doable for patients.

00:11:39.269 --> 00:11:46.269
However, anemia is tolerable only when the body has sufficient circulatory volume to continue to function.

00:11:46.269 --> 00:11:56.269
We also know that with that anemia, we can compensate with volume because volume is the critical component here to maintaining blood pressure.

00:11:56.269 --> 00:12:05.269
With low-cost blood volume expanders being available, current medical opinion increasingly abandons the arbitrary rule proposed back in 1942.

00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:13.269
That a hemoglobin level of 10 was the transfusion trigger or the lowest acceptable figure before administering a transfusion.

00:12:14.269 --> 00:12:21.269
Thus, Professor Earnshaw notes his first step in implementing a transfusion alternative program.

00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:30.269
I halved our transfusion rate by simply saying, could we lower our triggers from 10 to 8 and just taking a little more control over the decision?

00:12:30.269 --> 00:12:34.269
That was very easy. That cost nothing.

00:12:34.269 --> 00:12:42.269
Simply implementing the first pillar would cut out millions of transfusions and save billions of euros or dollars annually.

00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:52.269
The second important principle in transfusional alternative strategies involves stimulating red cell production in the patient's body.

00:12:52.269 --> 00:13:01.269
This is important for an anemic patient before surgery and it can speed recovery after extensive blood loss.

00:13:01.269 --> 00:13:07.269
Studies directed by Professor of Obstetrics Albert Huch have shown.

00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:18.269
Sufficient iron supplementation can already normalize the blood count to a large extent and at relatively little expense.

00:13:18.269 --> 00:13:26.269
In selected cases, the genetically engineered drug erythropoietin commonly called EPO can be used.

00:13:26.269 --> 00:13:31.269
Professor Mercuriali, a director of transfusion services explains.

00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:44.059
Simulated by the administration of erythropoietin, there is an acceleration of production of new red cells.

00:13:44.059 --> 00:13:50.059
The third principle or pillar is to minimize blood loss.

00:13:50.059 --> 00:13:54.059
The most important technique to control bleeding is to avoid bleeding.

00:13:54.059 --> 00:14:03.059
Meticulous surgery is practical and cost effective. A variety of tools can be used to assist.

00:14:03.059 --> 00:14:12.059
For example, electrocautory devices enable surgeons to cut rapidly and to seal blood vessels immediately.

00:14:12.059 --> 00:14:19.059
There are also modern drugs that can reduce bleeding. Some are applied directly to the bleeding area.

00:14:19.059 --> 00:14:25.059
Here a vibrant glue pad is used to stop blood from oozing out of a dissected liver.

00:14:25.059 --> 00:14:29.059
Professor Barone notes about the cost effectiveness of such agents.

00:14:29.059 --> 00:14:42.059
The decrease in intraoperative bleeding and the decrease in the use of blood products compensates for the cost of the cry.

00:14:43.059 --> 00:14:51.059
Another effective technique to minimize loss in instances of heavy bleeding is to salvage the patient's own blood.

00:14:51.059 --> 00:14:56.059
Recovery of as much as 50% of the blood otherwise lost has become a reality.

00:14:56.059 --> 00:15:02.059
This technique also meets the ethical needs of many who absolutely refuse donor transfusions.

00:15:02.059 --> 00:15:08.059
For instance, some of Jehovah's Witnesses have allowed cell salvage to be used.

00:15:08.059 --> 00:15:12.059
There are even such machines designed for small children.

00:15:12.059 --> 00:15:22.059
Cell salvage is a very important technique because when you use cell salvage, the blood lost by the surgeon is not lost for the patient.

00:15:22.059 --> 00:15:31.059
Many other beneficial strategies are available, all assist in avoiding the risks and societal costs of millions of transfusions.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:42.620
To illustrate the impact of properly combined techniques, consider the task faced by the medical team of four-year-old Luana in Modena, Italy.

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:46.620
She was born with a serious heart defect.

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:55.620
Her team, headed by Professor Marcelletti, chief of cardiovascular surgery, had to perform a series of complex operations.

00:15:55.620 --> 00:16:01.620
As requested by Luana's parents, the first operation was successfully done without donor blood.

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:11.059
Once again, for the second procedure, there were both skilled personnel and the appropriate equipment, including a cell salvage machine.

00:16:11.059 --> 00:16:20.059
The meticulous surgery, utilizing electro-cautory, took two hours, and Luana lost only 100 milliliters of blood.

00:16:20.059 --> 00:16:26.059
Her parents were delighted, and the medical team was pleased with the outcome.

00:16:27.059 --> 00:16:35.059
We have performed the operation without the use of blood transfusion, as we try to perform with all of our children.

00:16:35.059 --> 00:16:44.059
I think all these little babies deserve not to be transfused and not to take the risk of blood transfusion.

00:16:44.059 --> 00:16:52.059
Further proof of the effectiveness of heart surgery without transfusion is provided by Dr. Rosengart.

00:16:52.059 --> 00:17:05.059
When we looked at a series of 50 Jehovah's Witnesses, patients and 100 patients in the general population, we found a shorter length of stay and a lower cost using our blood conservation strategy.

00:17:05.059 --> 00:17:18.059
While many clinicians would hold that some situations absolutely require blood, what is the view of those experienced in the use of transfusion alternatives in life-threatening emergencies?

00:17:18.059 --> 00:17:21.059
First, an anesthesiologist's perspective.

00:17:21.059 --> 00:17:26.059
The cessation of bleeding, whether surgically or in other means, must be the first principle.

00:17:26.059 --> 00:17:34.059
It's important to act quickly and to keep in mind that modalities are still available, even in a trauma situation.

00:17:34.059 --> 00:17:37.059
Next, a surgeon's perspective.

00:17:37.059 --> 00:17:43.059
In any trauma patient with a significant blood loss, I would always prepare the cell-saver system.

00:17:43.059 --> 00:17:54.059
In one of the busiest trauma centers in the United States, Professor Kohn, chief of trauma and surgical critical care, notes about patients declining donor blood.

00:17:54.059 --> 00:18:03.059
We see more than 3,000 patients a year here that are Jehovah's Witnesses and we do about 250 to 275 major operations on them each year.

00:18:03.059 --> 00:18:13.059
And what we have seen in our population is no increased length of stay, no increased mortality. In fact, it appears to be somewhat decreased.

00:18:13.059 --> 00:18:22.059
On the basis of such experience, many physicians conclude that overall transfusion alternative healthcare is cost effective.

00:18:22.059 --> 00:18:29.059
Well, one of the beauties of transfusion alternatives is that the most effective alternatives are generally the cheapest.

00:18:29.059 --> 00:18:39.059
There's no doubt that blood is a costly product. We've been able to reduce our blood transfusion bill for the liver transplant programme here by 70% since we started adopting new techniques.

00:18:39.059 --> 00:18:49.059
And that equates to hundreds of thousands of pounds in a year and it's far more than the cost of the drugs and the other therapies we use and the mechanical methods we use for reducing blood loss.

00:18:49.059 --> 00:19:03.059
It takes more dedication than technical means. These similar results can be achieved without the use of costly machinery.

00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:12.059
And transfusion alternative healthcare has a benefit beyond saving money and meeting patient's physical needs. There is an ethical benefit.

00:19:12.059 --> 00:19:18.059
This care honors the patient's freedom of choice to accept or reject a certain treatment.

00:19:18.059 --> 00:19:26.059
One of the primary principles of good medical care is being concerned about what the patient wants.

00:19:26.059 --> 00:19:30.059
Professor Harding, who teaches ethics to medical and law students.

00:19:30.059 --> 00:19:39.059
Today, one would link that ethical duty not to do harm, to seek the best possible outcome for one's patient.

00:19:39.059 --> 00:19:49.059
With another duty which is to respect the autonomy of the patient, to respect the patient's own views and decisions.

00:19:49.059 --> 00:19:55.059
At Glasgow University, Professor of Law and Ethics in Medicine, Sheila McLean summarises.

00:19:55.059 --> 00:20:02.059
Doctors have virtually an absolute obligation both legally and ethically to respect the patient's choice.

00:20:02.059 --> 00:20:12.059
Concerning the advancing legal view generally designated patient rights, Professor Gio, founder of the Health Law Institute at New Chital University.

00:20:12.059 --> 00:20:28.059
I believe the basic element of patient's right is the right of self-determination, that is the right of any patient to decide what shall be done with his or her own body.

00:20:28.059 --> 00:20:34.059
Patients have a right to be told that there are alternatives and more than that there are alternatives.

00:20:34.059 --> 00:20:39.059
What are the respective risks and benefits expected to be associated with those?

00:20:39.059 --> 00:20:45.059
Concerning the evolution of patient rights, Professor Vysaur explains.

00:20:45.059 --> 00:20:53.059
Earlier, the doctor determined how to proceed and thereby shoulder the entire responsibility.

00:20:53.059 --> 00:21:04.059
In the course of time, the relationship has changed more and more into a partnership, doctor and patient meeting each other with full equal rights.

00:21:04.059 --> 00:21:11.059
Recognising patient rights accords with the UN's universal declaration of human rights.

00:21:11.059 --> 00:21:22.059
In fact, these legal issues have become so important that in 1997, the Council of Europe formulated the convention on human rights and biomedicine.

00:21:22.059 --> 00:21:33.059
Article 5 proclaims, an intervention may only be carried out after the person concerned has given free and informed consent to it.

00:21:33.059 --> 00:21:47.059
The doctrine of informed choice says that it is up to the patient to accept or to refuse any kind of medical act, for instance a blood transfusion.

00:21:47.059 --> 00:22:02.059
Addressing a sensitive issue, Article 6 states, the opinion of the minor shall be taken into consideration as an increasingly determining factor in proportion to his or her age and degree of maturity.

00:22:02.059 --> 00:22:16.470
There's no doubt that that minors in legal sense can and very often are able as adolescents to take decisions about their own treatment and their own health.

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:22.470
How does freedom of choice for patients and parents work out in practical terms?

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:32.470
Well, if the physician cannot think of finding a way of accommodating a patient's desire about alternatives to blood transfusion,

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:46.470
he should try to refer the patient to one of his colleagues or to another institution, or healthcare facility, where his alternative is really practiced.

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:53.470
But what about emergencies, where the victim may not be able to speak, to convey personal conviction?

00:22:53.470 --> 00:23:01.470
It's now recognized that people have the right to indicate treatment choices in advance.

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:14.470
And this takes the form of a written document where a patient shows that they have considered certain situations and they've taken a clear position about a treatment choice.

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:27.470
In an emergency, one would always also search for an advanced directive or a durable power of attorney, for instance, in the wallet of the patient.

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:31.470
Respecting patient rights also has healthcare benefits.

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:38.470
There is empirical evidence that patients who feel engaged in their treatment are likely to get better quicker.

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:45.470
Consider, for example, a case at St. Richard's Hospital in Chichester in southern England.

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:54.470
Mrs. Wittington had arthritis of her hip, which was so advanced that she required a total hip replacement.

00:23:54.470 --> 00:24:00.470
She is a Jehovah's Witness, and therefore declined to have a blood transfusion.

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:08.470
Well, I do believe that God's word is against taking blood, and we should appreciate that God's word is the truth.

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:12.470
Mr. Patel was quite happy to do it without blood.

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:23.470
It is the doctor's responsibility to listen to patients' demands, listen to what they have to say, and to give them an informed choice of alternatives.

00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:30.470
In Frank dialogue between physician and patient, the question of whether she would accept cell salvage arose.

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:41.470
When I knew more about the machine, and it was explained to me, I said I would accept having the machine.

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:49.470
The relationship between the patients and the medical staff is excellent here. We have a very open culture and a good learning environment.

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:52.470
What was the outcome of this cooperative approach?

00:24:52.470 --> 00:25:00.470
The strategies that we used intraoperatively during Mrs. Wittington's operation were meticulous hemostasis,

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:07.470
the salvage of blood using a cell saver system, as well as using a cemented hip replacement.

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:12.470
She tells me that she is delighted with the operation in terms of the pain relief.

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:22.230
As Earth's population continues to grow and age, their medical needs will be a greater challenge to healthcare structures,

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:31.230
many of which are already struggling. In this regard, Transfusion Alternative Healthcare offers a promising direction.

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:45.230
A well-adapted blood conservation program means a decrease in the total cost for the patient, but also a decrease cost for the society.

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:56.640
While all medical interventions involve risks, Transfusion Alternative Healthcare uniquely meets both patient needs and rights.

00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:05.640
I can foresee that in the future, patients will almost expect that any surgery which is necessary is carried out without blood transfusion.

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:18.640
Patient empowerment is important not only to better respect autonomy, but to promote good medical treatment.

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:31.640
The various steps to reduce the need of blood transfusion nowadays are very well established, well tested, and they are certainly safe.

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:36.640
This is universal, can be practiced in any institution, in any part of the world.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:42.640
Blood conservation is a safe, effective, and progressive medicine.

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:48.640
This is the best way of treating patients and clearly should be a standard of care.
