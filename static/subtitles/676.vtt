00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:06.049
Colombia is situated in the northwest of South America.

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:09.929
Its territory encompasses the Amazon rainforest,

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.529
tropical grassland, the Andes, mountain range,

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:18.329
and the Caribbean and Pacific coastlines.

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:21.649
It's known for growing high-quality coffee,

00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:23.929
but what is even more impressive there

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:27.530
is the spiritual growth among Jehovah's people.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.769
Colombians are very friendly and hospitable,

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.850
and our brothers show these qualities in an outstanding way.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.170
In March, we had a new old-time pick

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.170
in the number of publishers.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.170
We had 172,000 and 28 that shared in the preaching work

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.770
this special month of activity.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.850
As a result, on April 11th,

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.729
we had a whole-time pick in the number

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:00.729
of the Memorial Attendance, with 515,800 attendees,

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.170
three times the number of publishers.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.650
Because of the geography of the country,

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.569
there are some areas of Colombia

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:14.370
where it is not easy to reach with the good news.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.769
For this reason, from time to time,

00:01:16.769 --> 00:01:20.569
once a year, some special campaigns are organized.

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:25.329
Last campaign was organized from November 2016

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.569
to January 2017.

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:33.569
Seven thousand, 456 publishers shared in this campaign,

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:38.450
including several members of our Bethel family.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.890
I would like to share with you some encouraging experiences

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.930
that the brothers had during this campaign.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.810
A couple of regular pioneers wanted to share

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.650
in the campaign with other friends.

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.810
Unfortunately, no one was available to go with them.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.489
In addition to that, the territory where they were assigned

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:03.010
was far away, the climate was cold,

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.650
and there were no known Jehovah's Witnesses there.

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.009
At first, these made the couple worry,

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.610
but they took courage and they went to their assigned territory.

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:17.490
The very day they started to preach there,

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.610
they met a man who, after listening carefully

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.569
to their introduction, said,

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.009
I know what you are talking about.

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:30.650
In fact, when I was a child, I used to preach as you do.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.169
Then he added, I tell my neighbors

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:34.889
that we are Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.969
The couple was quite surprised,

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:40.129
especially because from what they knew,

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.449
there were no Jehovah's Witnesses in the area.

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:46.650
So they asked the men to explain more.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.650
The men told them that as a child,

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.409
he lived in a different part of the country

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:55.409
and that his grandmother was a Jehovah's Witness

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.449
and used to take him in service with her.

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:01.569
Later, because of unrest and violence,

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.810
he had to leave his own town

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.009
and moved to his current place.

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:09.689
He's now very happy to study again,

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.770
along with his wife and five children.

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:15.650
In the special campaign,

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.930
special effort is made to reach

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.289
the numerous indigenous communities

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:22.810
who are present in Colombia.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.169
In one of them, two sisters met a man

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:29.849
while walking toward the territory and preached to him.

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:33.930
He kindly told them that he was the chief of the community.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.009
At the moment, he was very busy,

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:37.490
but he was giving them permission

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.770
to preach to all in the community.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.330
After they preached to all in the community,

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.569
the sisters met this man again.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.849
He exclaimed, the people of God finally arrived.

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:52.849
Come on in, please teach us.

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:54.770
We were waiting for you.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.090
A great witness was given.

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:01.689
A week later, when the witness is called back,

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:06.289
they met 30 people waiting for them in the chief's house

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:09.169
with a listen to God brochures in their hands

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:11.409
ready to learn about Jehovah.

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.810
Yes, as these experiences illustrate

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.170
in Colombia, the fields are wide for harvesting.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.649
It is a great pleasure for me to convey

00:04:22.649 --> 00:04:25.290
the love and greetings of all our brothers and sisters

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.889
in Colombia, including the 255 members

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:30.209
of our Bethel family.
