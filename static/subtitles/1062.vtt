00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:05.230
Jesus called them serpents, offspring of vipers.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.230
Who is he talking about?

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.230
The Pharisees.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.230
And who were they?

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.230
A prominent Jewish religious sect in the first century.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.230
Why was Jesus so critical of them?

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.230
Because even though those religious leaders had knowledge of God

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.230
and prided themselves in their strict adherence to the law of Moses,

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.230
they did not do as Moses had said to listen to the future Savior

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.229
that Jehovah would raise up for His people.

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:37.229
That Savior is Jesus Christ.

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:41.229
But when the Pharisees saw Him miraculously curing the sick,

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:44.229
lame, and blind, even resurrecting the dead,

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:47.229
they did not rejoice over that and glorify God

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:50.229
for what He was performing through Christ.

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:55.229
The Pharisees were faithless, and they refused to believe in

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:57.229
and listen to God's Son.

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:01.229
Instead, they persecuted Jesus' disciples

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:05.230
because they did put faith in the Christ.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.230
So Jesus exposed the Pharisees for what they were

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.230
and called them serpents,

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.230
because of the deadly spiritual harm that they inflicted on others

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.230
who were influenced by them.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.230
In fact, the Pharisees exerted such great influence over the people

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.230
that prominent persons were afraid to confess openly their faith in Jesus

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.230
for fear of being expelled from their positions in the synagogue

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.230
and losing faith in the community.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.230
Can the same sort of fear hold people back today

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.230
from serving Jehovah as a disciple of God's Son,

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.230
fearing the rejection or ridicule they might have to endure

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.230
from neighbors, friends, or family?

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.230
If it is, how can you imitate Jesus' disciples?

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.230
They not only knew about God, but they trusted in Him

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.230
as their reliable father and friend.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.230
As proof of that, they went right onto the temple grounds

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.230
and Jerusalem in full view of everyone

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.230
and gave a bold witness about God's Son.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.229
They were powerful by their faith.

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:14.229
When the Jewish High Court, many members of which were Pharisees

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:17.229
heard about this, they were furious.

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:21.229
They ordered the disciples to stop teaching about Jesus.

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:23.229
What did they do?

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:26.229
Coward and fear? No.

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:31.229
We can read what happened at Acts 5, verse 29.

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:35.229
That's Acts 5, verse 29.

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:37.229
It reports,

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:40.229
In answer, Peter and the other apostles said,

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:46.479
we must obey God as ruler rather than men.

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:50.479
Jesus' disciples did not allow the religious leaders pressure

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:52.479
and threats to deter them.

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:56.479
They knew their priorities and the situations would arise

00:02:56.479 --> 00:03:00.479
when a Christian cannot obey both men and Jehovah God.

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:05.479
You see, human rulers forfeit their right to our obedience

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:09.479
when they demand what Almighty God prohibits,

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:16.479
or, as in this case, when they prohibit what God requires of us.

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:19.479
Even if they ban our preaching work,

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:22.479
we cannot stop carrying out our God-given assignment

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:24.479
to preach the good news.

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:27.479
So at that very moment,

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:29.479
the apostles said,

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:32.479
a precedent for all true Christians throughout the ages

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:37.479
to obey God as ruler first.

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:40.479
The disciples' faith made them real friends of Jehovah.

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:43.479
And as a result, today they are alive and well

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:48.479
in heaven with Jesus to serve with Him as kings and priests.

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:51.479
And what of those faithless Pharisees

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:53.479
and their coveted prominence?

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:57.479
Jesus told them to their face what fate lay ahead of them.

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:02.479
As recorded at Matthew, chapter 23, verse 33,

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:07.479
Matthew 23, verse 33.

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:09.479
He told them,

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:11.479
serpents, offspring of vipers,

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:16.480
how will you flee from the judgment of Gohanna?

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.480
Now, the judgment of Gohanna meant that if they did not change,

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.480
they would be everlastingly destroyed.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.480
If we are going to imitate the disciples' faith,

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.480
we must do as Jesus urged His followers.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.480
See what He said at Matthew, chapter 6,

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.480
and verse 33,

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.980
Matthew 6, 33.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.980
Keep on then seeking first the kingdom and His righteousness

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.980
and all these other things will be added to you.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.980
So Jesus' disciples must always make the kingdom their first concern in life.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.980
If we do that, then as Jesus promised,

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.980
Jehovah will see to it that we have the material

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.980
and spiritual necessities of life.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.980
Now, seeking the kingdom first in our life

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.980
includes preaching the good news of the kingdom

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.980
to as many people as we can.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.980
As with Jesus' disciples,

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.980
it requires courage and boldness to preach

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.980
when neighbors, friends, or family opposes.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.980
But we do not need to fear them

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.980
or any other religious enemies,

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.980
because Jesus taught His disciples how to preach boldly,

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.980
but discreetly.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:35.980
You can see this at Matthew chapter 10 and verse 16.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.980
Matthew 10, 16.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.980
He said, look, I am sending you out as sheep among wolves,

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.980
so prove yourselves cautious as serpents,

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.980
and yet innocent as does.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.980
It seems that most literal snakes

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.980
would rather flee than attack.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.980
So to be cautious here means to be prudent, sensible, shrewd.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.980
Now, the dove is known as the sheep of the bird world,

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.980
because of its gentle appearance and disposition.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.980
So to be innocent means being blameless,

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.980
genuine with pure motives.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.980
Jesus' point was that when his sheep-like disciples face persecution,

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.980
they need to combine the characteristics of being cautious

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.980
and innocent to avoid possible dangers

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.980
as they carry out their preaching work.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:33.980
For example, suppose colleagues at work, schoolmates,

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.980
or even members of your own family

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.980
who are most caustic remarks about your beliefs

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.980
as a witness of Jehovah.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.980
Instead of responding in kind by being equally sarcastic

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.980
about their faith, show them that their comments have no effect

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.980
on your peace and your pleasant demeanor.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:57.980
That's being prudent and blameless, cautious, yet innocent.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:03.980
We all need to keep imitating the faith of Jesus' disciples.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.980
Well, what have we learned from this symposium?

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:12.980
Two things. First, we must reject the course of faithless ones,

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:18.980
like Cain, Lamek, Noah's neighbors, Pharaoh, and the Pharisees.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:23.980
Second, we need to imitate Jehovah's faithful servants,

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:29.980
like Abel, Enek, Noah, Moses, and Jesus' disciples.

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:36.980
If we do, then we can enjoy living forever as a friend of Jehovah.
