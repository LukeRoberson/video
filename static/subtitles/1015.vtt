00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.710
Life in Ur was comfortable.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.710
We had all the modern conveniences.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.710
Then Trahova gave us an assignment we never expected.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.710
One that meant saying goodbye to the life we loved.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.710
But rather than look behind, Abraham and I looked ahead.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:29.710
We had seen Trahova's hand in our lives and we knew he would be with us every step of the journey.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.710
And he was in ways that surprised us.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.710
Ways we never could have imagined.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.710
Trahova did more than help us.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.710
He fulfilled his every promise.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:59.770
Saying goodbye is never easy.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.770
And even though we were excited about our new LDC assignment,

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:19.379
it was going to take us further than we'd ever been.

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:22.379
It wasn't just a new routine.

00:01:22.379 --> 00:01:37.670
It was a holy way of life.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.670
With each new movement project, we thought about Sarah.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.459
She focused on the good things ahead.

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:49.459
And not on what she had left behind.

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:53.420
And that's what we tried to do.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:03:02.530
Trahova's been so good to us.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.530
We didn't always know where the next project would take us.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:20.979
But we did know that Trahova would be with us every step of the way.

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:22.979
Jericho was doomed.

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:24.979
People were scared.

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:29.979
When the Israelite men showed up at my door, there was barely time to think.

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:32.979
But I knew what was at stake.

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:36.979
Even as a young girl, I had heard all the stories.

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:39.979
Trahova wasn't like the other gods.

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:45.979
He had dried up the waters of the Red Sea and given his people victory over the Amorites.

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:53.289
If I helped these men, I knew Jehovah would help me.

00:03:53.289 --> 00:04:00.289
For the first time in my life, I was standing with Jehovah's people on Jehovah's side.

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:11.939
And my faith was being rewarded.

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:14.939
There was no doubt about it.

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:16.939
I had found the truth.

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:33.620
So, why did I feel so anxious?

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:47.819
I knew how mom felt about the holidays.

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:54.939
I also learned how Jehovah felt.

00:04:54.939 --> 00:05:04.430
They displeased him.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.430
Some changes in my life were easy to make.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:20.259
But I really needed Jehovah's help for what I had to do next.

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:31.319
I loved my mom so much.

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:34.319
When I explained that I wouldn't celebrate the holidays anymore,

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:45.509
I could tell that she was hurt.

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:48.509
But I knew I was doing the right thing.

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:51.509
And prayed that Jehovah would help her understand.

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:57.860
Holiday season like no other.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.860
Like this 36 megapixel DSLR camera kit for just $3.99.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.860
Or would you believe this 65-inch 4K UHG Smart TV is only $8.49?

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:28.800
Hurry in before it's gone because the...

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.800
I admit I was surprised when she said she wanted to learn more.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.800
What a blessing.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.800
Thanks to Jehovah, I had found the truth.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:48.550
And now, maybe my family would find it too.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.550
I couldn't sleep or eat.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:56.550
I felt my hopes and dreams slipping away.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.550
But even if no one else really understood me,

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.550
I knew Jehovah would.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:06.410
I told him everything.

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.410
I knew that the God of justice

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:14.410
would set all matters right in his own time and in his own way.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:20.410
Jehovah answered my prayer in such a wonderful way.

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:26.410
I never forgot where this incredible blessing had come from.

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:29.410
There is no rock like our God.

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:42.819
I could tell from the doctor's voice the news wasn't good.

00:07:42.819 --> 00:08:05.189
I just didn't expect my health to worsen so quickly.

00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:34.820
I tried to act like everything was fine.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:39.440
But I was fine.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:47.809
But I wasn't.

00:08:47.809 --> 00:09:05.480
I came to Jehovah knowing he would listen and understand.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:09.240
That's what got me through.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:19.409
No one really knew what I was going through.

00:09:19.409 --> 00:09:39.070
Not even my friends.

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:41.070
I felt like Hannah.

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:45.450
Totally misunderstood.

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:54.120
But she had faith that Jehovah would set matters straight.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.120
And he did.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:01.009
For Hannah and for me.

00:10:01.009 --> 00:10:03.009
But more than that,

00:10:03.009 --> 00:10:14.399
it reminded me that I wouldn't have to deal with this illness alone.

00:10:14.399 --> 00:10:18.399
I remember the day the soldiers took me away.

00:10:18.399 --> 00:10:21.399
I had never felt more alone.

00:10:21.399 --> 00:10:24.399
My home, my friends.

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:27.399
Everything I knew was gone.

00:10:27.399 --> 00:10:32.450
But I still had Jehovah.

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:36.450
The master of the house was very sick.

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:39.450
He was in pain.

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:41.450
Elijah could help him.

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:44.450
I had heard about Elijah's miracles.

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:47.450
He had even raised the dead.

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:50.450
I knew Elijah could cure him.

00:10:50.450 --> 00:11:02.669
And Jehovah gave me the courage to speak up.

00:11:02.669 --> 00:11:07.360
I was taken from my home.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.360
My husband.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:14.759
And my spiritual family.

00:11:14.759 --> 00:11:24.980
I was imprisoned for my faith.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:27.980
It was another world.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:39.519
It wasn't easy staying strong.

00:11:39.519 --> 00:11:42.519
Every time I asked for a Bible,

00:11:42.519 --> 00:11:51.850
the answer was no.

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:58.419
But God's word was already in my heart.

00:11:58.419 --> 00:12:01.419
So I did what I loved the most.

00:12:01.419 --> 00:12:05.269
I talked about God's kingdom.

00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:10.269
Many of those I preached to seemed cold at first.

00:12:10.269 --> 00:12:13.269
But genuine love and the warmth of God's word

00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:17.809
just seemed to melt their hearts.

00:12:17.809 --> 00:12:22.809
I'm speaking up, took more courage than I thought I had.

00:12:22.809 --> 00:12:41.720
But not more courage than Jehovah could give me.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:45.720
It was hard to look beyond the locks and uniforms.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:50.720
But God's will is that all sorts of people learn about him.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:13:26.980
So I spoke about my God, Jehovah.

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:30.980
I knew that even behind prison bars,

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:35.740
Jehovah would give me the strength to help others.

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:46.539
I was engaged to Mary Joseph.

00:13:46.539 --> 00:13:49.539
I thought we would have a simple and quiet life.

00:13:49.539 --> 00:13:53.539
And then suddenly everything changed.

00:13:53.539 --> 00:13:57.539
I know that God sometimes asks us to do what is difficult.

00:13:57.539 --> 00:14:02.539
But this seemed impossible beyond anything we could handle.

00:14:02.539 --> 00:14:06.539
But I knew I was safe in Jehovah's hands.

00:14:06.539 --> 00:14:11.539
If we remained loyal to him and did our best to care for his precious son,

00:14:11.539 --> 00:14:16.539
he would always be loyal to us and give us what we needed.

00:14:16.539 --> 00:14:25.570
When they first told me, I thought it must have been a mistake.

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:27.570
I mean, me?

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:31.570
Oversee a department at an international convention.

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:43.220
I felt like it was just too much to handle.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:57.200
I remembered that I thought the same thing years ago.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.200
When I was asked to serve on a disaster relief committee

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:22.690
and when I served on the hospital liaison committee,

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:43.590
actually, I've always felt that way when I've received an assignment from Jehovah.

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:53.970
But what I've learned is he's always ready to help.

00:15:53.970 --> 00:16:08.779
So when Jehovah asked me to do something that seems difficult,

00:16:08.779 --> 00:16:15.100
I just remind myself to pray, stay loyal,

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:36.700
and have faith that he'll give me what I need.

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:48.340
No, I was not Jewish.

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:53.340
But I saw that this Jesus was no ordinary man.

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:58.340
I had heard about his power to help others and my daughter was suffering.

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:01.340
I wouldn't take no for an answer.

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:02.340
I couldn't.

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:05.339
This man was from God.

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:08.339
There was nowhere else to turn.

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:11.339
I had faith in Jesus.

00:17:11.339 --> 00:17:17.650
When he heard me, he said, let it happen to you as you wish.

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:19.650
And then it did.

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:33.140
My beautiful precious daughter was healthy and smiling again.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:35.140
I never thought it would happen.

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:41.589
I finally found what I'd been searching for.

00:17:41.589 --> 00:17:43.589
A good relationship with God.

00:17:43.589 --> 00:17:53.019
Then one day, a coworker texted an article that claimed to expose Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:17:53.019 --> 00:18:06.700
I was tempted to read it and then I thought back

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:09.700
to when I first met Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:21.150
I was so excited about what they taught me from the Bible.

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:24.150
That God's name is Jehovah,

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:28.150
the kingdom is a real government, and so much more.

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:33.940
Why would I want to learn about Jehovah's Witnesses from their enemies?

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:47.500
But my friends, not so much.

00:18:47.500 --> 00:19:05.700
I saw people who really love one another.

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:10.200
It's a real brotherhood.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:15.119
But it wasn't just the people.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:45.250
This was the truth.

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:55.200
I didn't need to learn about Jehovah's Witnesses from their enemies.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:06.700
I had seen for myself that the worship to true God, Jehovah.

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:10.700
During those first few days, everything was a blur.

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:15.700
My sister Mary and I had never felt so empty and lost.

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:19.700
I knew that if our Lord had been here,

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:22.700
our brother would not have died.

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.700
But through the tears and the pain,

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:30.700
I had no doubt that the resurrection was real.

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:34.700
That someday, someday he would live again.

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:39.950
Who could have imagined it could happen that very day?

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:42.950
And right before our eyes,

00:20:42.950 --> 00:21:29.819
we wept tears of joy and thanked our loving father in heaven, Jehovah.

00:21:29.819 --> 00:21:34.970
I lost my son. I lost part of myself.

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:51.160
I tried to stay busy, but everything felt empty.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:22:21.380
In my darkest times,

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:24.380
Jehovah's words brought me comfort.

00:22:24.380 --> 00:23:00.799
Not a day goes by that I don't think about Brandon.

00:23:00.799 --> 00:23:06.900
Not just memories of how it was.

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:14.210
But even more, how wonderful it'll be to see him soon.

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:16.210
In God's new world.

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:30.819
For nearly a year,

00:23:30.819 --> 00:23:34.819
I had been held in solitary confinement

00:23:34.819 --> 00:23:39.819
in a tiny filthy, bug-infested prison cell.

00:23:39.819 --> 00:23:48.420
Five and a half years after my arrest,

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:51.420
I was released.

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:54.420
If we truly rely on Jehovah,

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:59.420
really love him and cry out in a heart for his help,

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:02.420
just as he did not forsake me,

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:06.420
he will not forsake his servants.

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:23.259
They arrested me and took me and for questioning.

00:24:23.259 --> 00:24:26.259
An interrogator invited me to sign a document

00:24:26.259 --> 00:24:29.259
stating that I would discontinue preaching.

00:24:29.259 --> 00:24:32.180
I said,

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:36.180
I would rather live in prison with my relationship with God intact,

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:39.180
than be free and lose his approval.

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:46.799
My determination has been to hit the Bible admonition.

00:24:46.799 --> 00:24:50.799
Trust in Jehovah and do good.

00:24:50.799 --> 00:25:10.849
I have learned that doing this leads to receiving the requests of your heart.

00:25:10.849 --> 00:25:13.849
As the world went from bad to worse,

00:25:13.849 --> 00:25:19.220
I dug deeper into God's word.

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:40.309
I wanted to stay strong like so many brothers and sisters in the past.

00:25:40.309 --> 00:25:48.779
Those who remain faithful had no special abilities and were inconspicuous.

00:25:48.779 --> 00:25:52.779
Surely all of us must always trust in Jehovah

00:25:52.779 --> 00:25:57.960
with all our heart.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.960
I memorized scriptures.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:07.609
I knew these words would build my faith

00:26:07.609 --> 00:26:10.609
and give me the strength I needed to face what was to come.

00:26:10.609 --> 00:26:35.359
Just to code this week,

00:26:35.359 --> 00:26:38.359
as local authorities enforce new restrictions on Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:26:38.359 --> 00:26:54.990
this is coming just 14 days after this.

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:57.990
Trust in Jehovah and do what is good.

00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:11.730
Reside in the earth and act with faithfulness.

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:14.730
Find exquisite delight in Jehovah

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:20.859
and he will grant you the desires of your heart.

00:27:20.859 --> 00:27:22.859
We had to be more discreet,

00:27:22.859 --> 00:27:25.859
but we never stopped talking about God's word.

00:27:25.859 --> 00:27:32.900
We had to face many difficulties,

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:35.900
but with God's word embedded in our hearts,

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:39.900
we faithfully endured it to the end.
