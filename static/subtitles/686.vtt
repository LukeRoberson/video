00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:12.939
This past summer, the new mayors and Susan and I had the privilege to attend the special

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:16.219
convention into Blycy, Georgia.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.379
We had delegates from 18 different countries.

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:29.059
Artola Tennis, including those tied in 21,914, with 208 baptized.

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:41.829
The unity of our brotherhood was on display as you will see in this brief video.

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.950
When the teaching committee informed us that we had been approved to hold a special convention

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.229
in Georgia, we were thrilled.

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:53.469
They provided detailed direction and responsible brothers were appointed to oversee the daunting

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:59.390
task of caring for nearly 2,500 delegates from more than 10 countries.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:08.590
Several brothers and sisters from all over the country eagerly volunteered to assist.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.989
Many volunteers were willing to travel several hours each way for training.

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:17.310
Jehovah bless the unity and willing spirit of those who were courageous and strong and

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.709
went to work.

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:23.390
These hardworking brothers and sisters often were willing to use their own material resources

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.109
to support the special convention preparations.

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:33.959
Because of their willing spirit, everything was ready on time.

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:40.120
A brother told me when we got on the plane that you're taught to love but when you get

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:52.579
there you're going to be shown how to love and that happened.

00:01:52.579 --> 00:02:18.000
We landed at midnight and they were there, ready to hug us, it was awesome.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.819
With Jehovah's help I can fight with Jehovah's help I can win.

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.740
We are the victors.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.939
We win.

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:36.900
We courageously stay with Jehovah God and His people.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:44.419
It's absolutely amazing to have brothers from Azerbaijan, Armenia, Turkmenistan, Poland,

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:49.580
the United States, Spain and many other countries and it's like we've known our brothers

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.500
all our life but yet we're just now meeting them.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.699
Our united brotherhood gives us yet another reason for confidence that there are more with

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:03.819
us than against us.

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:10.180
No matter where you go, the friends are there, they'll take you home, they'll feed you,

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.699
they'll go out and service with you.

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:18.500
The purpose of the Unigathering Program was not only to give a taste of the local culture

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.580
but was also an opportunity for local publishers who worked on the program for month to demonstrate

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:41.780
their love toward their visiting brothers and sisters.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.259
We don't want to go back home.

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:49.860
The love of the brothers and the way that we're an international, complete family.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.180
It's not separate, it's not segregated, it is a family and that experience is like nothing

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.180
ever.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:05.580
It's very touching.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.460
We kept hearing that this experience is a little taste of what the new world will be like.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.900
When everyone on the planet earth will be of the same family, we'll truly love each other,

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.620
have the same father.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.660
And that's absolutely what makes us brothers and sisters.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.779
We all have the same father, our father, Jehovah.
