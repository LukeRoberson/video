00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:23.239
It is difficult for many co-ingations to view videos or sync songs at our meetings.

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:28.719
Most of them use their personal devices and have to download their videos before the

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:31.160
meeting.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:38.320
We pray that soon every brother and sister is able to enjoy Jehovah's spiritual food

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.469
the best way they can.

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:50.710
From the inspiring visions given to prophets to the powerful acts performed by Jesus, Jehovah

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.789
has used visuals to convey truth and hope.

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:01.149
Likewise, Jehovah's organization uses visuals to instruct.

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:07.950
However, not everyone has the needed equipment to fully benefit from these additional teaching

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.150
tools.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.590
To give a direction of the governing body, the publishing committee began upgrading

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.629
the audio video equipment in Kingdom Halls across Africa.

00:01:20.629 --> 00:01:23.709
This was no easy task.

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:36.269
In this report, we'll see a globally coordinated effort to address this need.

00:01:36.269 --> 00:01:42.230
So in 2022, a team was assembled from global purchasing worldwide design construction

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.750
in World Headquarters Broadcasting.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.349
The first thing we did was we met with the branches and we really listened to them.

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:53.109
We were working with more than 20 African branches.

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:56.950
There's 21,000 different meeting locations.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.709
We learned that there were over 13,000 locations that needed something.

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:03.670
It wasn't just one item.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.950
It was providing them a fully functional system.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.030
This meant addressing their audio, their video, their power and their download needs.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:22.389
We had to provide more than 5,500 sound kits, more than 8,000 video kits, more than 9,000

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:27.789
power banks, and over 8,000 satellite dish kits.

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:30.710
Everyone was different and needed a different solution.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:37.189
As the scope of this massive project became clear, one question loomed.

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:41.509
Where are we going to get all of this equipment?

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:46.389
Our suppliers needed to produce materials at a faster rate than they had ever done before,

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:52.270
greater quantities, and with less people, it ultimately seemed impossible.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.389
We would talk amongst ourselves and even with the suppliers, and get their feedback on

00:02:56.389 --> 00:03:00.310
how to deal with those challenges, and then bring the matters to Jehovah and Prayer

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.389
and make a final decision.

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.509
When there was a global shortage of certain materials, we had them.

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:09.710
We could continue to produce what we needed.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.509
We met deadline after deadline.

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:21.509
The next big hurdle is now transporting thousands of items to over 13,500 Kingdom Halls.

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:25.949
We had to figure out how to get equipment from all over the world with different lead

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:32.270
times, delivered into all of these thousands of locations, when these countries also

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.150
have different import and custom regulations.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.150
It was mind-boggling.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.270
Jehovah and Jesus were the only ones that knew how to make this happen, and that's exactly

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.930
what they did.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.289
The first day we received the letter, others immediately gave names of those who should

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:53.569
coordinate this initiative.

00:03:53.569 --> 00:04:01.849
We would set up 10% of over 40% at the Kingdom Halls or Homes of Practice.

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:08.330
The brothers drove a long way to the 10% through unfavorable conditions, yet they were

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.409
not concerned as to the conditions that they were driving through.

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:17.170
Because they knew that when they get rid of this equipment, it would change their face

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.490
of their Christian meetings.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:26.170
The economic and transportation conditions in the country are super challenging, and so

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:31.410
it's been very, very difficult for the brothers, but this challenge has not stopped them from

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.889
getting their equipment back out to the congregations.

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:43.310
Many locations are difficult and hard to reach with no road access.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:50.600
Other brothers use bicycles traveling many, many kilometers.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:59.470
They are really determined to get this equipment to the congregations.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.670
Our brothers and sisters are eager to start using these kits, but most are not audio

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.430
video technicians.

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.750
In each branch, volunteers were selected to help with this very task.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:24.810
I'm Katia, and this is my husband, Chamele.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.329
It's a huge privilege for me to work on this project and install the audio video equipment

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:32.370
for this congregation.

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:37.129
Traveling from one congregation to another is challenging.

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:42.769
Sometimes we take two days driving on roads full of potholes to get to the next congregation,

00:05:42.769 --> 00:05:51.300
but when we get there, the reception from your brothers is so warm.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:59.540
They dance, sing, and cook tasty food for us.

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:08.540
We forget all about the challenges we faced during the trip.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:14.500
In this congregation, we will install a JW box and satellite kit.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.980
We will install a frame for the projector and leave two speakers for them so that they

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.779
can listen very well to the meetings.

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:27.860
Now we're going to install and train the brothers to use the equipment.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:35.019
World Headquarters provides a guide that helps us a lot.

00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:39.540
In this congregation, they keep the equipment at home because it's not safe to leave it

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.540
in the Kingdom Hall.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:47.220
This means they have to install and uninstall the equipment at every meeting.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.620
Other congregations usually keep the equipment in different houses because it's not safe

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.980
to leave it all in the same house.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:02.019
Working together on this project, help me to understand that Jehovah is a God that sees

00:07:02.019 --> 00:07:03.500
his people.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:11.939
His eyes can reach the brothers wherever they are.

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:30.029
Can you imagine what it was like at the first meeting with their new audio video equipment?

00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:32.949
There's still so much work to do.

00:07:32.949 --> 00:07:36.589
New requests for equipment continue to pour in.

00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:44.550
All of this is possible because of the volunteers motivated by love and the generous donations

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:48.629
from you, our worldwide brotherhood.

00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:56.189
But most important, this is possible because Jehovah, the God of powerful visuals, wants

00:07:56.189 --> 00:07:59.550
all of us to hear and see the truth.
