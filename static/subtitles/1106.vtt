WEBVTT

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:13.529
We knew when we first got married that we would enjoy having a family.

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:18.530
So when we first found out that we were pregnant, we were overjoyed.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.530
When Becky first told me she was pregnant,

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.530
it's like a light switch went off in my heart.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.530
Immediately, I felt like a dad.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.530
Instantly, you begin to make plans.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:39.100
I was like all this love just flooded in.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.100
One day, Becky was feeling a little off and a friend encouraged us to just go see the doctor.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.100
So we did.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.100
And while we were there, they did an ultrasound.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.100
The doctor came back and they said there wasn't a heartbeat anymore.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:01.560
That was a very difficult moment.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.560
Something I can never forget.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.560
Because all of a sudden, all of you,

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:16.000
those hopes, those dreams, those preparations you are making, they're gone.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:25.739
This place in your heart that opened up to make room for this child

00:01:25.739 --> 00:01:31.739
is now this huge gaping open hole and there's nothing to fill it.

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:38.849
It just is an incredible emptiness.

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:42.849
We didn't know what to do.

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:48.849
But it was a meeting night, so we wanted to go to the meeting.

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:51.849
It felt like the place where Jehovah's Holy Spirit is.

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:58.849
And we wanted to be there because we knew we were not going to be able to survive this on our own strength.

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:02.769
We needed Jehovah.

00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:06.769
After people learned that we had lost the baby so many people

00:02:06.769 --> 00:02:09.770
shared a little bit of their experiences with me.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.770
Switched me to just feel not alone, for sure.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:20.770
But Jehovah has also given us some incredible friends, friends that have stuck closer to us than a brother.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.770
Friends that always seem to know when we're having a hard day,

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.770
who have prayed with us, who have taken walks with us,

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.770
listened, and I know those are expressions Jehovah has given us.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.770
Regaining joy isn't working progress.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.770
There was a particular scripture in personal study that I found very helpful.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.770
It saw 139 where it talks about how there's no where.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.770
That Jehovah can't find us.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.770
There's no darkness that is too dark from Jehovah.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.770
And it felt like such a dark place.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.770
Dwelling on that scripture was something that helped me a lot and gradually bit by bit.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.770
I felt like Jehovah did help me to see beautiful things again.
