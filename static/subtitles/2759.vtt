WEBVTT

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.839
We all have an important reason to act safely.

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:07.019
Act 1728 reads,

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.019
for by him we have life and move and exist.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.059
Since life is such a precious gift from Jehovah,

00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:18.859
safety and the sanctity of life

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.300
must be a priority in our daily lives.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.140
Our organization has a goal of zero accidents

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.859
and not just on construction projects,

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.060
being safety conscious is a lifestyle

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.939
that affects all we do.

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:37.340
Whether we're at home on the road

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.899
or on theocratic projects,

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.100
our attitude towards safety is really a reflection

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.700
of our spirituality and our love for Jehovah

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.939
and the brothers and sisters.

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:52.140
Let's see a few dramatizations from around the world

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.460
to help us see how we can all be more safety conscious.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:59.790
That day changed everything.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.790
In that moment,

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.790
I realized that my actions could have injured someone.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.789
I could even have become blood guilty.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:15.219
My problem was overconfidence.

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:22.689
I never had a car accident

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:25.689
and I thought it could never happen to me.

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:32.159
But just a second of distracted driving can kill.

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:36.409
I meditated on Psalm 36.9

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:38.409
with you is a source of life.

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:42.409
By your light, we can see light.

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:44.409
My love for Jehovah,

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.409
the source of life,

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:48.409
now affects how I drive

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:51.409
and even my approach to other activities.

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:54.409
For example, I love sports

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.409
but I stop playing those with a high potential

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.409
for serious injury

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.409
and even relatively safe ones.

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:03.409
I'm committed to enjoying in the safest way possible.

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:22.259
I think Jehovah every day I'm still alive.

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:25.259
It was such a close call.

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:29.259
It was a street I've walked across hundreds of times.

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:31.259
No one has ever been hurt there before,

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:33.259
so I felt safe.

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:39.539
Besides, I was preoccupied with what I had to do that day.

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:42.539
I didn't see the car until I heard this screeching tires.

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:49.129
I wish I hadn't taken this to become more safety conscious.

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:53.659
But now we continually train our children

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:55.659
to stop, think,

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:59.659
and evaluate even familiar surroundings before proceeding.

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:16.360
Acting safely is one way we showed Jehovah

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.360
how much we appreciate life.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.240
Whether at home or elsewhere,

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:36.819
being safe has become a lifestyle for us.

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:38.819
As a body of elders,

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:41.819
we take Proverbs 22 verse 3 seriously.

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:45.819
The shrewd one sees the danger and conceals himself,

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:48.819
but the inexperienced keep right on going

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:50.819
and suffer the consequences.

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:54.740
If we take short cut

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.740
or permit something unsafe and an accident happens,

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.740
we bear a measure of responsibility of the result.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.740
We love Jehovah

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:16.009
and our brothers and sisters too much to allow them.

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:41.980
With good direction

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.980
and training from the LDC maintenance training team,

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.980
we've learned to apply the principle of Proverbs 22 verse 3.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.980
We identify potential risks

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.980
before we start working

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.930
and make a plan to complete it safely.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.930
We always assign the right person to a task,

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:07.930
a way of everyone's knowledge, limitations, and abilities.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.930
And while it's wonderful to have young ones with us,

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.930
we make sure they are always supervised

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.930
and work with either their parents

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:41.139
or another responsible person.

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:44.139
Life is a gift from Jehovah.

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:48.139
And I want to train my children to value it.

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:59.600
The smallest actions can save lives.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.600
My conscience is clean now.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.600
Understanding that making safety a priority

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.600
is an expression of my love for Jehovah

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.600
and my brothers and sisters.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.579
I'm happier now.

00:07:12.579 --> 00:07:37.079
Could it be that some of our actions

00:07:37.079 --> 00:07:41.079
reveal a lack of appreciation for the gift of life?

00:07:41.079 --> 00:07:46.079
As was mentioned, safety is part of being spiritual people.

00:07:46.079 --> 00:07:48.079
That understanding motivates us

00:07:48.079 --> 00:07:52.079
to develop safer routines and ways of doing things.

00:07:52.079 --> 00:07:56.079
Our minds will be focused on keeping us safe

00:07:56.079 --> 00:08:01.079
by identifying risk and adjusting how we do things.

00:08:01.079 --> 00:08:06.079
This way we stay safe by eliminating or controlling the risk.

00:08:06.079 --> 00:08:10.079
The world focuses on speed and cutting corners

00:08:10.079 --> 00:08:12.079
to get things done.

00:08:12.079 --> 00:08:14.079
In contrast, we want our theocratic

00:08:14.079 --> 00:08:19.079
and personal activities to show the safety is a priority.

00:08:19.079 --> 00:08:22.079
This can be accomplished if we view safety

00:08:22.079 --> 00:08:25.079
as a reflection of our love for Jehovah

00:08:25.079 --> 00:08:28.079
and his precious gift of life.
