00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:07.459
On July 9, 2015, the Constitutional Court of South Korea held a public hearing on the issue

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:11.859
of punishing conscientious objectors to military service.

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:18.859
The court considered the cases of three conscientious objectors, including one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:25.859
When this highest court previously examined the issue in 2004 and in 2011, it found no

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:34.859
basis to declare unconstitutional, the military service laws that penalize conscientious objectors.

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:43.659
South Korea is considered to be the worst example of conscientious objection to military service.

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:50.659
As far as conscientious objection is concerned, we are completely isolated from the international

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:53.659
human rights community.

00:00:53.659 --> 00:01:00.460
By compelling the draft and punishing those who refuse it, the state is violating freedom

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.060
of conscience.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:11.260
For seven decades, some 20,000 conscientious objectors have been imprisoned and some of them are tortured.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.060
Their heartbreaking experiences will finally be discussed today.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:23.260
I was sentenced to prison for one year and six months for my conscientious objection to military service.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:31.260
I refused a military duty because the Bible commands us to love our enemies as ourselves.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.859
Since the last public hearing, the right to conscientious objection has been firmly recognized

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:37.859
by the international community.

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:42.859
The European Court of Human Rights and the UN Human Rights Committee have repeatedly confirmed

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:48.060
that this right is based on freedom of conscience and freedom of religion and ruled to protect

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.659
the human rights of conscientious objectors.

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.659
In line with this new trend, the Constitutional Court of Korea should depart from its earlier position

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.659
and embrace international standards.

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.659
The three-hour hearing discuss the constitutionality of convicting and imprisoning young men

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:11.659
for conscientious objection to military service and the possible solutions for those objectors.

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:17.659
The attorney for a petitioner Kim Min-hwan stated the legal grounds for coming before the court

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:20.659
and asking for the law to be changed.

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:26.659
The petitioners refusal of military service because of his religiously motivated conscience

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:31.659
is a fundamental right protected by the international covenant on civil and political rights

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:34.659
and the constitution of Korea.

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:41.659
The UN Human Rights Committee, which is authorized to interpret the covenant, has reaffirmed for more than 20 years

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:48.659
that a right of conscientious objection can be derived from freedom of conscience and freedom of religion.

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:54.659
We can conclude that such a right is also derived from the constitution of Korea.

00:02:54.659 --> 00:03:02.659
The constitution has prescribed from the outset that international laws can be incorporated into domestic laws.

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:09.659
The UN Human Rights Committee has ruled five times since 2006 that the government must carry out its duty.

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:16.659
The attorney for the Ministry of National Defense expressed sympathy for imprisoned conscientious objectors

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:21.659
but saw only obstacles in providing alternative service.

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:27.659
Adoption of alternative service should bring no harm to the important public interest of national security.

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:32.659
If alternative service is adopted and no punishment is imposed on military dodgers,

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:35.659
many would pretend to be conscientious objectors.

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:39.659
After the attorney's opening statements, the justice has questioned them.

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:42.659
I have a question for the Ministry of Defense.

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:48.659
Currently, you have more people waiting for enlistments than you really need.

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:56.659
So why not give the opportunity to those who request alternative service

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:01.659
for reasons of their conscience or religious convictions?

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:10.659
South Korea ascended to the international covenant on civil and political rights in 1990

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:15.659
and submitted its periodic report in 1998.

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:17.660
The report says,

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:25.660
all the rights under the covenant are protected by our constitution, Article 37, paragraph 1.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.660
And violating the covenant amounts to a violation of the constitution.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.660
The UN Human Rights Committee ruled the Korea violated the covenant

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.660
because it punishes conscientious objectors.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.660
Still, the government refuses to follow the committee's recommendation.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:54.660
Is it not a violation of the constitution as we reported to the UN in 1998?

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:02.660
We are severely criticized by the international community for the poor condition of human rights in Korea.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.660
It is not as dangerous as you claim.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.660
If problems arise, the government can seek solutions.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.660
I think the government should be more positive in this regard.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.660
Only if alternative service is designed in a reasonable manner.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.660
In fact, the terms of alternative service are very important.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:33.660
The Ministry of Defense argues that it is premature to adopt alternative service.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:39.660
But freedom of conscience is the most fundamental right.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:46.660
The problem is how to realize such fundamental rights under the constitution.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:52.660
Next, the court heard from the legal expert representing the petitioners.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:06:02.660
Crime involves anti-social and immoral acts that can harm others' life or cause physical harm.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:09.660
However, conscientious objectors do not cause any harm to others.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.660
They are not violent, but peaceable.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.660
Their objection takes the form of non-feasance.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.660
And is far from aggressive.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.660
Any form of punishment is inappropriate for them.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.660
They are treated the same as military vaders.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.660
But they deserve constitutional protection and favorable consideration,

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.660
while vaders have no justifiable ground from a constitutional perspective.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:45.660
It is clear that the current sentencing does not correspond to their crime.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.660
They need to achieve other goals.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:56.660
That's why many local judges request the constitutional court to adjudicate on the Military Service Act.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:01.660
They want the court to understand their distress and agony.

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.660
And the prosecutors seem to feel the same way.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.660
Each year, 600 young men are imprisoned,

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.660
and their families are devastated.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:17.660
Not enough for the court to reconsider the matter.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:23.660
Therefore, the government saying that there is no reason to change the current situation

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:29.660
is the most compelling reason for the court to change its former position,

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:35.660
as the state has the responsibility to alleviate the agony of its people.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:39.660
Important to the petitioners is a program of alternative service

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:43.660
that conforms to international standards.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:49.660
These criteria include various forms of alternative service

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:53.660
that are compatible with the beliefs of conscientious objectors,

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:58.660
in the public interest and not of a punitive nature,

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:06.660
and purely civilian service that is not connected to or supervised by the military.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:13.660
The petitioners urged the court to act now to release all conscientious objectors in prison in Korea

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:19.660
and give them an opportunity to contribute to society in a meaningful way.

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:23.660
In order to respect the principle of separation of powers,

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:28.660
the court suggested in 2004 that legislation be enacted.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:32.659
Since then, more than 6,800 have been imprisoned,

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:35.659
and yet the legislature did not take any measures.

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:40.659
The Constitutional Court has respected the legislature's authority for 11 years.

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:43.659
It has been enough.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:47.659
The more than 700 objectors should be released from arbitrary detention

00:08:47.659 --> 00:08:53.659
and provided with opportunities to contribute to their community in a meaningful manner.

00:08:53.659 --> 00:09:00.659
It is time for the court to stop the long line of imprisonment of 18,000 men.

00:09:00.659 --> 00:09:04.659
The court is the last stronghold for their constitutional rights.

00:09:04.659 --> 00:09:07.659
The Constitutional Court adjourned the hearing.

00:09:07.659 --> 00:09:14.659
It will deliberate, and in time render a decision regarding the constitutionality of the military service laws

00:09:14.659 --> 00:09:17.659
that penalize conscientious objectors.
