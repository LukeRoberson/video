00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:18.219
Wow! That is fascinating!

00:00:18.219 --> 00:00:22.219
Did you know when you see things the way Jehovah sees them?

00:00:22.219 --> 00:00:24.219
It can give you courage.

00:00:24.219 --> 00:00:28.219
That's what happened to Joshua and Caleb.

00:00:28.219 --> 00:00:30.219
Come on, I'll show you.

00:00:30.219 --> 00:00:35.340
Ah, the Promised Land.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.340
A beautiful place flowing with milk and honey.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.340
Well, not like that.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.340
Ah, that's better.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.340
Jehovah told the Israelites to conquer it and make it their new home.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:54.340
Joshua, Caleb, and 10 other spies were sent to observe the land.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.479
And it was amazing!

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:04.480
After 40 days, they returned to the Israelites camp with a good report.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:11.480
However, 10 of the spies also had a bad report about the people they saw.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:18.480
They said that people were stronger than the Israelites and that all of them were giants.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.480
Next to them, they were like weak little grasshoppers.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.480
Did Joshua and Caleb see it that way?

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.480
No, after all, Jehovah had already used his power to free them from Egypt.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.480
Jehovah sent plagues against the Egyptians.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.480
He parted the Red Sea so the Israelites could get away safe.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.480
And he even destroyed Pharaoh's army.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.480
Joshua and Caleb saw things the way Jehovah sees them.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.480
That no one is stronger than Jehovah.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:02:04.400
When Jehovah's friends remember what he can do, they're courageous.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.400
Did Joshua and Caleb ever get to live in the Promised Land?

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.400
Read their story and imagine you were there.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.400
You make time every day to learn from Jehovah's friends.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.400
What do you think?

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.400
What did Joshua and Caleb do to become Jehovah's friends?

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.400
When have you been afraid of something you felt you couldn't do?

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.400
What can you remember about Jehovah that gives you courage?
