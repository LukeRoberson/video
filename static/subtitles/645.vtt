00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.419
Our text for today, Acts chapter 24 and verse 15,

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:12.419
answers a very important question that affects the lives of billions.

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:14.419
Now to understand that question,

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:22.820
I'd like to take you back to a lecture that brother Russell gave in Shanghai, China, in 1912,

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.420
and he asked this important question basically as a child.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.420
I'd like to just quote a portion of that lecture, the beginning is introduction.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.820
He said, well, I remember as a child inquiring, what would be the fate of the heathen,

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.619
or today we would say the unrighteous?

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:47.020
And the answers that I received that only through faith in Jesus, the Redeemer, is there any salvation?

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.219
Then I query, now here's the key question.

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.700
What is the penalty of their ignorance of the only name given under heaven,

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.700
or amongst men whereby we must be saved?

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.700
Well, the answer was the usual one of all our Orthodox creeds

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.700
that they would spend eternity in a hell of unutterable anguish.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.700
Well, that's a pretty shocking answer.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.700
Eternity of hellfire for what?

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.700
No chance to learn about Jehovah and Jesus Christ.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.700
You're simply born at the wrong time, really?

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.700
Well, today, if you ask that same question of many Christian religions,

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.700
you're going to get some very bizarre and unjust answers.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.700
And you can imagine that that answer of burning in hellfire for eternity

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.700
did not sit well with brother Russell, especially as he got older.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:50.700
And then the rest of his lecture, he explains, that it did not match that answer of burning in hellfire,

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.700
did not match his understanding of a God of love, wisdom, justice, and power.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.700
And he was really excited and amazed when he really understood better the Bible's answer,

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.700
Jehovah's answer for what would happen to the unrighteous.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.699
Well, what does the Bible explain is the hope for the unrighteous,

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:17.699
or those who have died without a chance to learn about Jehovah or Jesus Christ?

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:21.699
Well, Acts chapter 24 and verse 15 is a great place to start.

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:27.699
There's going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:34.699
So the unrighteous would include those when their lifetime didn't have a chance to learn about Jehovah.

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:38.699
Good we might say, Jehovah's not going to leave the unrighteous out.

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:40.699
He's going to take care of them.

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:44.699
But after reading this one verse, you might think to yourself,

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:49.699
if both the righteous and the unrighteous are going to get resurrected,

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:55.699
what's the point in being righteous if they're both going to get life?

00:02:55.699 --> 00:03:02.699
Well, here's where we need other scriptures in the Bible to help us understand what Jehovah has in mind for the unrighteous.

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:05.699
It would be wrong to conclude from reading this one verse

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:11.699
that both the righteous and the unrighteous are going to get everlasting life,

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:14.699
especially for the unrighteous.

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:19.699
In the 2021 annual meeting, Brother Jeff Jackson gave a talk and he used several scriptures

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:26.699
and beautiful pictures to explain what the Bible's hope is for the unrighteous.

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:31.699
Let's review a few of the scriptures that he highlighted in that talk.

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:37.699
And we're going to focus on the resurrection hope for the unrighteous.

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:41.699
Let's first look at John chapter 5 verses 28 and 29.

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:47.389
John chapter 5 verses 28 and 29.

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:54.389
Do not be amazed at this, for the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out.

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:57.389
Those who did good things to a resurrection of life,

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:04.669
and those who practiced vile things to a resurrection of judgment.

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:09.669
Well, did you notice the past tense who practiced vile things?

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:17.670
Well, Brother Jackson explained that the unrighteous are not going to be allowed to practice vile things in the new world.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:26.670
So the past tense of practicing vile things must refer to the things they did in their life before they got resurrected.

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:34.670
Well, what then is Jesus referring to in verse 29 when he talks about a resurrection of judgment?

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:41.670
If they're not being judged on what they did before, they got resurrected on what will they be judged?

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:49.579
Well, here's where Revelation chapter 20 and verse 12 helps.

00:04:49.579 --> 00:04:52.579
Revelation chapter 20 and verse 12.

00:04:52.579 --> 00:04:58.579
And I saw the dead, the great and the small standing before the throne and scrolls were open.

00:04:58.579 --> 00:05:02.579
But another scroll was opened, it is the scroll of life.

00:05:02.579 --> 00:05:10.579
And the dead were judged out of those things written in the scrolls according to their deeds.

00:05:10.579 --> 00:05:22.579
So the unrighteous will be taught from the new scrolls, and they'll be judged on their obedience and deeds during the thousand year reign of Christ.

00:05:23.579 --> 00:05:29.579
Well, what if they choose to disobey or not to listen to live by Jehovah's standards?

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:35.579
Here they are, they're taught, they're explained what Jehovah's standards are from the new scrolls and they decide not to obey.

00:05:35.579 --> 00:05:41.579
Why is there chapter 65 and verse 20 indicates that they will be removed immediately?

00:05:41.579 --> 00:05:49.579
They'll not be allowed to corrupt the new world with their disobedient attitudes and actions.

00:05:49.579 --> 00:05:59.579
Of course, on the other hand, if they choose to obey and remain faithful under the final test at the end of the thousand year reign, they could get everlasting life.

00:05:59.579 --> 00:06:08.980
And it's this final outcome that is referred to by Daniel chapter 12 and verse 2.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:13.300
Daniel chapter 12 and verse 2.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:24.300
And many of those asleep in the dust of the earth will wake up, some to everlasting life, and others to reproach and to everlasting contempt.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:37.300
So at the end of the thousand years is to what Daniel chapter 12 and verse 2 is referring to when the final outcome, either everlasting life or everlasting death.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:42.300
Let's just review these scriptures briefly with this chart on the screen.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:55.300
Acts chapter 24 and 15 and John chapter 5 verses 28 and 29 both refer to the beginning of the thousand years when the unrighteous are resurrected.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:06.300
Now on what will they be judged? Well, Revelation chapter 20 and verse 12 explains that during the thousand years the resurrected unrighteous will be taught out of the new scrolls.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:11.300
And they will be judged based on obedience to what is outlined in the new scrolls.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:18.300
Of course, if they choose disobedience, that will lead to removal as Isaiah 65 and verse 20 indicates.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:30.300
And Daniel chapter 12 and verse 2 refers to the final outcome, the final everlasting outcome for the resurrection of the unrighteous.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:38.300
Isn't it amazing and wonderful to see what Jehovah has in mind for the hope for the unrighteous?

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:47.300
You know, today governments, they fight for their sovereignty. They fight wars over their sovereignty over this piece of land.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:56.300
And soldiers and civilians are simply to them collateral damage in trying to establish their sovereignty.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:04.300
Satan has callously sacrificed billions of lives in his effort to challenge Jehovah's sovereignty.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:14.300
But Jehovah, he never considered the unrighteous as collateral damage even when defending his sovereignty.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:25.300
He viewed them rather as precious lives that he's going to resurrect and offer them the opportunity for everlasting life that Satan took from them.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:39.299
The solution that Jehovah has put in place for the resurrection of the unrighteous is yet another beautiful example of the love, wisdom, justice, and power of our great God, Jehovah.
