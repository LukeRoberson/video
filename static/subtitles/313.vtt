00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:27.539
We do have good friends in our congregation, but there's so much work.

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.589
Why is Jessica so upset?

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:36.829
Okay, maybe I should have asked before turning down that dinner invite.

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.909
But she knows how busy I am.

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:48.659
I've got elders' meetings, work, pioneering.

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:59.100
But she just says, we never do anything fun anymore.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.149
Maybe she's right.

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.260
Sometimes even when we're together,

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.819
we're not really together.

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:37.650
Our lives are filled with spiritual activities.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:52.439
Our family worship hasn't exactly been regular.

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.560
Maybe I fooled myself into thinking because we're busy doing things for Jehovah,

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:10.870
it's okay to skip it sometimes.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:16.150
We argued again tonight.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.750
Then went to bed angry.

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:43.150
Something we said we'd never do.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.229
The next morning, I told Jessica how sorry I was.

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:50.870
And she admitted she felt bad too.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.909
We decided to research Ephesians chapter four that night for family worship.

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:00.270
One article mentioned how sad it would be if marriage mates spoke to each other

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.830
with less respect than total strangers.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.960
That really struck us.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.479
Then we read Ephesians 4, 31, and 32.

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:17.560
Put away from yourselves every kind of malicious bitterness, anger, wrath,

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.360
screaming and abusive speech, as well as everything injurious.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.560
But become kind to one another, tenderly compassionate,

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:33.759
freely forgiving one another, just as God also by Christ, freely forgave you.

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:41.180
We both promised to work on making our words and tone more loving and kind.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.780
We also studied the Bible accounts of Aquila and Priscilla,

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.379
who are a beautiful example of what it means for a married couple to be one flesh.

00:03:50.379 --> 00:04:05.430
They were together at home, at work, and in the ministry.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:19.129
That's when we realized we needed to draw closer as a couple.

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:31.660
Since then, we do as much as we can together.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.240
We're still busy in spiritual activities,

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.930
but they are never an excuse to neglect our relationship.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.329
And now, we aren't just marriage mates.

00:04:47.329 --> 00:04:50.529
We're once again best friends.
