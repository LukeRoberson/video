00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:12.849
To encourage us to promptly follow up on interest that we find in the Phil ministry, Paul likens our work to a plant that grows from a little seed.

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:16.850
Now, what vital for a planted seed to grow?

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.850
One authority says,

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:26.850
Of all the factors that determine seed germination, water is the first and most important.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.850
And another reference says,

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:37.850
Until seeds have sprouted, keep the seed bed moist, never allowing it to dry out.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.850
So, what will happen to a seed that is not watered?

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.850
Nothing, it will lay dormant.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:54.850
The regular watering is vital for a seed to sprout, to take root, and in fact continue to grow.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.850
Now, with these facts in mind, Paul's words at 1 Corinthians chapter 3 and verse 6,

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.849
shows that more is required than simply planting a seed of truth.

00:01:07.849 --> 00:01:14.849
Let's note his words. It's in 1 Corinthians chapter 3 and verse 6.

00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:23.739
It says, I planted Apollo's watered, but God kept making it grow.

00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:32.739
Though all credit goes to Jehovah God for making the spiritual seed grow, but he allows us to have a role in the process.

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:39.739
Did you notice the important role Apollo's played? He did the watering.

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:49.739
In a regular way, he helped keep the spiritual soil of the individual moist, never allowing it to dry out.

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:57.739
Many people who show interest in the Kingdom message today are searching for the truth about God.

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:04.739
In order to teach them progressively, we must return again and again.

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:10.740
This requires good preparation and organization on our part.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:17.740
By promptly making return visits, we demonstrate a sincere concern for the individual,

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:24.740
wanting to help them grow spiritually and develop a relationship with Jehovah.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:31.740
In the following video, notice how a sister follows up on interest shown.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:42.580
Ami left a great question for her next visit.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:50.870
Return visit, Mrs. Iwata.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:58.919
I told her I'd visit this morning. I just didn't schedule the time.

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:10.180
I could at least stop by on the way back.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:24.090
Mr. again, if I didn't try something different, I was just going to keep missing her.

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:51.620
First, I wanted her to know I hadn't forgotten her. Dear Mrs. Iwata, I hope you're doing well.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:04:03.360
I promised to come by early next week. By the way, your flowers are so beautiful.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:35.389
Then I made a plan for my service day, pulling through, is just too important to leave to chance.

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:40.389
As you plan your share in the ministry, follow the good example of the sister in the video

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:44.389
and schedule time to make regular return visits.

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:50.389
Doing so is just as important as other aspects of our ministry.

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:58.389
These regular visits with interested people are vital links in the chain leading to a Bible study.

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:07.569
In our ministry, we often compliment the householder for the beautiful flowers or plants in their yard,

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:11.569
just like the sister did in the video.

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:14.569
But how do they get that way?

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:25.569
Well, the householder probably watered them on set days or even used an automatic sprinkler timer to schedule regular watering cycles.

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:33.569
To have healthy and vibrant plants, watering cannot be left to chance.

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:37.569
Well, how can we apply that to our ministry?

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:46.569
Before leaving a person that has shown interest, endeavor to set the proper time to water.

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:49.569
The water of truth will come on.

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:57.569
Perhaps a what day or hour would you like for me to return to continue our discussion or to answer the question?

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:06.569
Do this consideration really dignify as the person, allowing them to share in setting the appointment?

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:14.569
It's important that we be willing to water an interested person at the most convenient time for them.

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:21.569
Then, just like setting a timer, put that appointment where you'll remember it.

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:30.329
The sister in the video put it in her electronic calendar so she could be reminded later.

00:06:30.329 --> 00:06:35.329
If you promise someone that you'll return, then keep your promise.

00:06:35.329 --> 00:06:44.329
Remember Jesus' simple statement recorded in Matthew 537, just like your word, yes, mean, yes.

00:06:44.329 --> 00:06:50.329
If they're truly interested, they may go to great efforts to keep the appointment.

00:06:50.329 --> 00:06:55.329
How disappointed there would be if we didn't show up.

00:06:55.329 --> 00:07:02.329
Following through is just too important to leave to chance.

00:07:03.329 --> 00:07:14.329
Because of the busy lives that people have today, it may be hard to find the person at home again, even if you set an appointment.

00:07:14.329 --> 00:07:22.329
So, it's a good idea to try and obtain his contact information, maybe his phone number.

00:07:22.329 --> 00:07:28.329
Some publishers anticipate this challenge and simply ask, do you text?

00:07:28.329 --> 00:07:35.329
By simply texting, you may be able to keep in touch and cultivate the interest further.

00:07:35.329 --> 00:07:44.470
And if you can't get his contact information and the person isn't home at the agreed upon time,

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:49.470
you might leave a brief note just as the sister did in the video.

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:55.470
And this will assure the householder that you haven't forgotten them.

00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:03.470
The disciple making work requires patience and persistence.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:12.509
In this regard, note what Ecclesiastes 116 says.

00:08:12.509 --> 00:08:20.509
Ecclesiastes 116, it says, so your seed in the morning and do not let your hand rest until the evening.

00:08:20.509 --> 00:08:30.019
Do not know which will have success whether this one or that one or whether they will both do well.

00:08:30.019 --> 00:08:37.019
When it comes to planting literal seed, we don't know when and where it will sprout.

00:08:37.019 --> 00:08:43.019
Many factors are beyond our control.

00:08:43.019 --> 00:08:47.019
Something similar can be said of the disciple making work.

00:08:47.019 --> 00:08:55.019
We need to be patient and positive because we don't know who will respond.

00:08:55.019 --> 00:09:05.019
Lastly, and of utmost importance, even if they return visit his brief, share a scriptural thought.

00:09:05.019 --> 00:09:13.019
The spiritual content of our conversation is what makes our visit different from many others that they may have.

00:09:13.019 --> 00:09:19.019
Do they have neighbors, friends, workmates or relatives that check in on them?

00:09:19.019 --> 00:09:28.019
But for them to grow spiritually, the water of truth from God's Word must be dispensed.

00:09:28.019 --> 00:09:39.940
To convey just a brief scriptural thought may provide just enough to keep their spiritual soil moist.

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:48.940
The work involved in following up interest is a very important assignment that Jehovah has given to each of us.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:56.940
With this in mind, let's return to Paul's illustration and see how Jehovah views us.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:05.559
It's back at 1 Corinthians chapter 3 and verse 9.

00:10:05.559 --> 00:10:15.559
It says, for we are God's fellow workers, you are God's field under cultivation, God's building.

00:10:15.559 --> 00:10:24.559
It's an honor to be one of God's fellow workers, enabling us to show our love for Him and for our neighbors.

00:10:24.559 --> 00:10:32.559
It brings us great joy to share the good news of peace by following up on interest shown.

00:10:33.559 --> 00:10:35.559
And we can be assured.

00:10:35.559 --> 00:10:50.220
Those who respond favorably will forever appreciate our diligent efforts when they recall how we promptly followed up when they showed interest.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:58.220
Brother William Malenfant, a helper to the teaching committee, will now present the final talk of this symposium.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:04.220
Be ready to share the good news of peace, help students grow to maturity.
