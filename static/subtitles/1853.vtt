00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:05.480
So how can we continue to be faithful in spite of our human weaknesses?

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:16.719
Growing up I had like absolutely no help problems at all and I love playing basketball and I enjoyed my life in the congregation

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.199
This was a kid who had his whole life in front of him

00:00:22.719 --> 00:00:24.719
It was taken away in a moment

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.509
November of 2019 I was diagnosed with a massive brain tumor

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:41.659
I'm saying like why me? Did I do something wrong? I wanted to know why I had to happen now

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.500
16

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.420
I'm close to 18 when I think is like the prime of my life

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:57.390
That night before I was going to have surgery was probably one of the scariest nights of my life

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.950
So I wanted to be able to still do the things I love and

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.349
I really just didn't want my lifetime

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.769
The count of David that was one that was very prominent in my mind

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:18.930
There was many times in his life where he had to fight foes that were very scary and life-threatening

00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:23.730
And this situation I was dealing with was pretty scary and life-threatening

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:26.370
But I knew Jehovah had my back

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.569
We talked about getting the brothers from HLC there to talk to back us up with the alternatives

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:34.930
on his card

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.730
The doctor was impressed when he asked Elijah if he had any questions

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.930
And Elijah asked him a couple of questions about the procedure and then also brought up the blood issue

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.170
This showed the doctor that this was a young man who had his own stand his own convictions

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:57.569
If Jehovah tells me that blood is sacred and then I'm listening

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.650
Elijah kept on reminding us that even if he doesn't wake up on this surgery bed

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:10.370
No matter what happens he's still going to wake up whether it's now or in the future in paradise

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:21.490
They finally came out only to tell us that there was complication

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:31.169
Elijah fell into a coma and we were waiting on answers that the doctors weren't able to give us

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.650
It was roughly about close to five months

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:38.449
Then he was in a coma

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:40.289
However

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:44.370
Jehovah kept providing the friends the support

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.889
We kept getting texts telling us just how many friends were praying

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.250
for Elijah and for all of us to get through this

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:03.069
It's spring of 2020 is when I gradually began to wake up

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.629
It's way harder to

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:14.830
Move around as I used to super painful and hard. I have a taxi as of right now temporarily in my right hand

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:21.150
So I'm not able to perform certain activities as well as I would like to

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.849
In my heart, I love basketball and I wish I could

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:36.849
Participate but knowing I can't because I'm something I can't control physically. It's really hard on me

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:41.810
Job he was always a great example in the Bible to me

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:48.610
I view him in a totally different light now because he was also hit with a medical issue

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:55.569
So but he managed to maintain his faith and Jehovah eventually blessed Job for that

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.770
Since the coma Elijah's seal definitely has it lessened if anything it's increased

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.810
He gives a whole new meaning to widening out

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.169
Because we want to be a zealous and as busy in the ministry as he is

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:12.530
Elijah has not accomplished any of this in his own strength

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:16.129
He very quickly will give credit to Jehovah

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.129
But also will give credit to his family for the amount of support that he's received

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.970
And give credit to the brothers and sisters for the support he's received from them as well

00:04:24.209 --> 00:04:28.689
He's been engaged in the field ministry and he's been active in doing whatever assignments we give him

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.930
Within the congregation we were able to appoint him a ministerial servant

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.930
He's got all of this support

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.170
He knows that Jehovah's with him and in that sense Jehovah truly is at his right hand

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:45.649
I know that we have a hope that Jehovah has given us in the future of perfect life

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.410
It gives me a goal and more of a motivation to help everyone reach that goal and get there

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:53.649
There's light at the end of the tunnel

00:04:54.769 --> 00:04:56.769
So I thank Jehovah for that so much
