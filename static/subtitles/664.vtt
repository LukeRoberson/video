00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:07.599
Burundi is a lush mountainous east-African country that's surrounded by

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:14.880
Congo-Kingshasa to the west, Rwanda to the north, and Tanzania to the south-east.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:22.760
The 12,700 zealous publishers of the good news live up to the words that we find

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:30.600
in 2 Timothy chapter 4 and verse 2. And there it tells us to preach the word to

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:39.960
be added urgently in favorable times and in difficult times. Now in favorable

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.520
times our brothers average around 16 hours of service a month and they conduct

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.200
three Bible studies each. And our young ones are zealous too. Take Nola for

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.039
example, she's six years old, and two men came to her house to borrow some hot

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.600
charcoals that are commonly used to cook food. And later on Nola noticed that

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.840
the two men were using these coals to light up a cigarette. And so she went up

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.200
to them and says, if I knew that you would be using these coals to light up your

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.760
cigarettes, I would not have given them to you. She then went to the Kingdom Hall

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.599
picked up some magazines on smoking, brought them back to the men, and she insisted

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:27.760
that they read them right away. She also sees the opportunity to invite them to the

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.200
upcoming regional convention and she is insisted once again that they attend. Impressed

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.780
with her persistence, the men did attend two days of the convention.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.659
Public witnessing is quite effective in Burundi. Primary consideration is usually given to

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:53.700
areas of high pedestrian traffic, but we would be so overwhelmed by crowds of

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:02.170
people that we have to choose areas with less pedestrian traffic. That haven't

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.209
been said. Publishers are still often surrounded by ten or more people asking

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:13.849
questions, taking publications, having meaningful conversations. Now one woman

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.530
who was surprised by this new method that we were using went up to the brothers

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:27.569
and exclaimed, now everybody will go to your church. Now Burundi has recently been through

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:34.729
difficult times, unfortunately, with civil unrest due to elections. And in parts of the

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:41.849
capital city, Bujumbura, riots posed challenges for our brothers. Because of that, the branch

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.969
office had to provide food relief to some of our brothers and sisters who could not go

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:54.409
to work. They had to stay home. Nevertheless, our brothers maintain their zeal. And the

00:02:54.409 --> 00:03:01.129
civil unrest happened at the same time that Nepal was hit by an earthquake. And it was

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:06.770
encouraging because although our brothers could have been consumed by their own difficulties,

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:12.930
we often heard the brothers at Bethel or in the congregation praying for our brothers

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:20.050
in Nepal. Through this difficult time, our neutral stand and our good reputation as witnesses

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:26.250
was a protection. One brother had to walk through an area that was hardest hit by clashes

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.169
and riots. And he wondered how he would make it through safely. So what he did is got

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:37.729
a convention badge, slipped in a piece of paper that said on it, Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:43.009
And whenever the rioters would stop him, he'd show this badge, and it let him go. He had

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:51.969
no problems and arrived to his destination safely. This past May was the worst of the civil

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:58.189
unrest. And we thought for sure that the activities of our brothers and sisters would

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:06.009
understandably be lower. But to the contrary, Burundi experienced an all-time peak in regular

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:14.250
pioneers, an all-time peak in Bible studies being conducted, over 41,300 of them. And

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:20.449
the publisher average went from 16 to 18. And during that difficult time, we also held

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:27.610
the first class of the School for Kingdom Evangelizers in the local language, Kirundi,

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:35.449
and the 20 happy students graduated on July 26th. Burundi is an evangelizer's paradise

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:42.490
as we can see from the results obtained in favorable times and in difficult times. During

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.370
the tribulation of the first century, when Stephen was murdered and all the Christians

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:55.209
were scattered, Acts 11, 21 says that a great number that became believers turned to the Lord.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:03.930
We pray that we have the same outcome in Burundi. It is a great pleasure to convey to you the

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:11.129
warmest Christian love of the 85 members of the Bethel family and the 14 missionaries in Burundi.
