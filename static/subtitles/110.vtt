00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.009
Welcome to JW Broadcasting for January 2024.

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:30.699
In November, we enjoyed the exciting first half of the annual meeting program.

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.700
Now please, enjoy part two.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.700
We'll now enjoy the first of two symposiums.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.700
Each speaker will introduce the next.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.700
So let's give our attention, please, to brother Jeffrey Winder,

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.700
who will consider the theme, how does the light get brighter?

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:00.390
In recent years, the annual meeting has been an occasion where clarified understanding of Bible truths,

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.390
a new light has been announced and explained.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.390
Of course, it's not at every annual meeting that this takes place,

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:15.390
but when Jehovah makes something known, often it's at the annual meeting where it is announced.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.390
Now, will there be new light today?

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:29.739
I think Brother Cook already spilled the beans a bit, but we look forward to see what is in store for our program.

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:40.739
But how do you ever wonder, though, how exactly does Jehovah reveal clarified understanding of the Scripture's new light in modern times?

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:48.739
When the governing body is meeting together, as the faithful and discreet slave, how does it work?

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:51.739
How exactly does the light get brighter?

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:58.739
How does Jehovah use that arrangement to clarify our understanding?

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:02.739
Well, first of all, what do we know from the Scriptures?

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:05.739
Let's look at four points.

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:07.739
The first one is this.

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:12.740
By what means does Jehovah reveal new light?

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:25.180
Well, for that, we can turn to 1 Corinthians chapter 2 and read together 1 Corinthians 2 verse 10.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:36.180
For it is to us, God has revealed them through His Spirit, for the Spirit searches into all things, even the deep things of God.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.180
So clearly, by what means does Jehovah reveal new light? It's by His Spirit.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.180
We recognize the key role that Jehovah's Spirit has in revealing the truth.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.180
Point two, to whom does Jehovah reveal clarified understanding?

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:03.030
Well, for that, we can turn to the book of Matthew, chapter 24, and read together Matthew 24 verse 45,

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:15.819
who really is the faithful and discreet slave, whom His master appointed over His domestics, to give them their food at the proper time?

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:27.819
So clearly, Christ has appointed the faithful and discreet slave, and it is through this channel that Jehovah through Christ works to provide spiritual food.

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:41.819
Just with those two first points, it's very clear to us how spiritual truth, new understanding, is communicated from heaven to earth by means of the Holy Spirit through the channel of the faithful and discreet slave.

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:47.819
Question number three, when does Jehovah reveal new light?

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:55.819
Well, we just have to look back to verse 45. Matthew 24, the slave will provide the food at the proper time.

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:59.819
There's a clear timing element indicated there isn't there.

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:08.819
And so, Jehovah reveals clarified understanding at His time when it is needed, and when it will help us to carry out His will.

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:15.169
Number four, at what rate does He reveal new light?

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:21.170
Is it all at once like a dump truck, or is it metered out like a trickle?

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:29.899
Well, the answer to that is found in the book of Proverbs chapter 4 in verse 18.

00:04:29.899 --> 00:04:41.750
Proverbs 4, 18, with the path of the righteous is like the bright morning light that grows brighter and brighter until full daylight.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.750
So the Bible here uses the illustration of daylight, and what does that teach us?

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:56.750
Well, the watchtower said, these words aptly apply to the way in which Jehovah reveals His purpose to His people gradually.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:08.750
So just as daylight grows brighter and brighter gradually, a proper understanding of Bible truths comes gradually, as we need it and as we are able to absorb it and use it.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:15.750
And we appreciate that, don't we? It's easier on our eyes when literal light gets brighter gradually.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.750
And so it is with understanding of Jehovah's purpose as well.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:29.750
For example, think about Abraham. Could Abraham have handled and absorbed a complete understanding of Jehovah's will at His time?

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:41.750
How He would use the twelve tribes of Israel, the Mosaic law, the understanding of Christ and the payment of the ransom, and the first century Christian congregation, the heavenly hope, the last days, details about the great tribulation.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.750
No way, He couldn't handle all of that. He didn't need it.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:53.750
But Abraham had what He needed to serve Jehovah acceptably during the time that He lived.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:06:01.750
Well, we have the privilege to live during the last days, where true knowledge was foretold to become abundant.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:09.750
But even still, it is released and made known at a pace that we can absorb, that we can handle, and that we can use.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.220
And we thank Jehovah for that.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:21.220
So this is what we know from the scriptures and from our own experience as well about how the light gets brighter in modern times.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:26.220
It comes about by means of the Holy Spirit through His channel of the faithful discrete slave.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:32.470
He reveals it gradually and at a time that it is needed.

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:42.470
Well, knowing this, then we are not embarrassed about adjustments that are made, nor do is an apology needed for not getting it exactly right previously.

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:49.470
We understand this is how Jehovah operates. He reveals matters gradually when it is needed.

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:54.470
And also, the governing body is neither inspired nor infallible.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:59.470
And so it can air in doctrinal matters or in organizational direction.

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:09.470
The brothers do the best they can with what they have and what they understand at the time, but are happy if Jehovah sees fit to clarify matters.

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:21.040
And then that can be shared with the brotherhood. And when that happens, we understand this because it is Jehovah's time for that to happen, and we eagerly accept that.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:29.040
But now back to our original question, okay, we understand these things from the scriptures, but really how does it work when the brothers are meeting together?

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:35.040
How does Jehovah help them come to a better understanding of things?

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:42.040
Well, that's an appropriate question because Jehovah does not intend for it to be a mystery or overly secretive.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:51.040
In fact, in his inspired scriptures, he reveals examples of when understanding was clarified in the Christian era.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:59.040
And a notable example is around 49 CE when clarification was needed regarding the requirements for salvation.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:09.040
And specifically, the question was, would Gentile males first need to be circumcised and submit to the mosaic law in order to be saved?

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:19.040
This was a significant matter that could have divided the congregation, and so it was referred to the apostles and the older men, the governing body at that time.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:29.040
And in fact, at Galatians 2.2, Paul states that as a result of a revelation, he brought the matter to the brothers in Jerusalem.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:36.039
So Christ himself directed that this important doctrinal matter be settled by the brothers taking the lead.

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:57.039
And in Acts 15, Jehovah allows us to look in on that meeting, to be a fly on the wall as it were, to hear their discussion, to see how the Holy Spirit worked with them, how they used God's word, how they came to a conclusion, and then the result that was sent and conveyed to the congregations.

00:08:57.039 --> 00:09:01.039
And the process is not entirely different today.

00:09:01.039 --> 00:09:15.779
So let's take a look at what happened. If we turn together to Acts chapter 15, Acts 15, in beginning in verse 6, it says the apostles and the elders gather together to look into this matter.

00:09:15.779 --> 00:09:27.779
So this is an important matter. It's brought before the governing body of that day. And then in verse 7, it mentions that there is much intense discussion.

00:09:27.779 --> 00:09:37.779
So a lively conversation, the brothers felt free to express themselves respectfully, but they were sharing their thoughts and opinions about the different sides of the issue.

00:09:37.779 --> 00:09:51.779
And in verse 7, Peter stands. And maybe this is the point that is reflected in our artwork here. And Peter begins to speak and relates his comments based on his real life experience with Cornelius.

00:09:51.779 --> 00:10:02.779
So they're considering some facts. And if you look at verse 12, Peter's words strike a chord because the entire group becomes silent.

00:10:02.779 --> 00:10:15.779
And in this we see humility, don't we? Because none of the brothers were trying to force their personal opinion or get their idea approved, they were collectively looking to Jehovah for direction on the matter.

00:10:15.779 --> 00:10:27.779
Well, this makes way then for Paul and Barnabas to begin to explain their experiences, so more facts, more evidence that they could consider. And then in verse 13, James speaks up.

00:10:27.779 --> 00:10:42.779
And he uses the scriptures to help the brothers draw a proper scriptural conclusion. He applies Amos 9-11 and 12 saying that Jehovah would turn his attention to the nations to take out of them a people for his name.

00:10:43.779 --> 00:11:01.779
Well, verses 19 through 21, he recommends a decision. Verse 25 indicates that that decision was unanimous. And then in verse 22, it mentions that they send the brothers out to inform the congregation of this clarified understanding.

00:11:02.779 --> 00:11:13.779
So the whole process described there, we see the use of God's word, we see the leadership of the Christ, the operation of the Holy Spirit, working through the brothers, taking the lead at that time.

00:11:14.779 --> 00:11:26.779
And so we can see it's the process is not intended to be a mystery or to be overly secretive. And the process today is not much dissimilar than that.

00:11:27.779 --> 00:11:42.779
In 2010, the watchtower explained it this way. It said, when the time comes to clarify a spiritual matter in our day, Holy Spirit helps the faithful and discreet slave to discern deep truths that were not previously understood.

00:11:43.779 --> 00:11:51.779
The governing body as a whole considers adjusted explanations. What they learn, they publish for the benefit of all end quote.

00:11:52.779 --> 00:12:08.779
So generally, the process happens this way. First of all, a question comes up. And so it could be that a governing body member in his personal study or his personal Bible reading notices something that then raises the question.

00:12:08.779 --> 00:12:17.779
Or it could be that a question comes up during the preparation or translation of spiritual food that requires more consideration.

00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:26.779
World events might put the spotlight on a particular prophecy that then gets closer attention. So in one way or another, a question comes up.

00:12:26.779 --> 00:12:40.779
And that question is then put on the governing body's agenda for discussion. And the question is, does this require or warrant additional research?

00:12:40.779 --> 00:12:47.779
The brothers are not making a final decision on what the new understanding will be just asking, does it warrant additional research?

00:12:47.779 --> 00:12:56.779
And if the answer is yes, then a research team is assigned to provide recommendations and research for the governing body to consider.

00:12:56.779 --> 00:13:07.779
And this research includes a summary of everything that we have said, the organization has said on the subject since 1879. All the watchtowers, what have we said?

00:13:07.779 --> 00:13:13.779
Also, it includes what the context of the verse indicates about its meaning.

00:13:13.779 --> 00:13:21.779
Further, what bearing do parallel accounts have on the understanding of the account if there are any parallel accounts?

00:13:21.779 --> 00:13:29.779
And finally, what impact does the original Hebrew or Greek have on our understanding of the verse?

00:13:29.779 --> 00:13:36.779
Well, once that whole research package is compiled, it's placed back on the governing body's agenda for review.

00:13:36.779 --> 00:13:46.779
And of course, once it goes on the agenda, then each individual member of the governing body, under prayer, reviews the information and thinks about it in preparation for the meeting.

00:13:46.779 --> 00:13:54.779
And then is discussed as a group at the governing body meeting, again, under prayer, relying on Jehovah's Holy Spirit.

00:13:55.779 --> 00:14:01.779
And when this matter is discussed, the discussion is not rushed, nor is the decision forced.

00:14:01.779 --> 00:14:11.779
But often, like in the first century, it's a lively discussion as the brothers feel free to share their opinions and their thoughts, the results of their meditation and their research.

00:14:11.779 --> 00:14:25.779
But there's also humility there, because again, none of the brothers are trying to force their idea or try to get their thoughts approved, but there is this collective unified desire to see Jehovah's direction on the matter.

00:14:25.779 --> 00:14:32.779
And where is he steering things? The goal is to discern Jehovah's direction on the matter.

00:14:32.779 --> 00:14:40.779
And often, or at times, we could say, the final result might be quite different than what the research package originally recommended.

00:14:40.779 --> 00:14:46.779
But that's Jehovah's Spirit working through the faithful and discrete slave to bring us to the right decision.

00:14:46.779 --> 00:14:50.779
And the brothers are looking for a unanimous decision.

00:14:50.779 --> 00:14:59.779
It's times it may seem like this is a solid adjustment, but if it's not unanimous, it just might not be time yet for it to be revealed.

00:14:59.779 --> 00:15:02.779
So it's not forced, the matter is set aside.

00:15:02.779 --> 00:15:09.779
And it could be that sometime later, even some years later, the matter comes back up and then it sails right through.

00:15:09.779 --> 00:15:17.779
Or maybe it does get approved, but now with a couple of key points discern that weren't discerned earlier.

00:15:17.779 --> 00:15:28.779
Well, with this thorough process, under prayer, and when there is unanimous accord, then the brothers take that as Jehovah's direction and then are happy to share it with the brotherhood.

00:15:28.779 --> 00:15:39.769
So this helps us to understand the process, understand how light gets brighter in modern times.

00:15:39.769 --> 00:15:50.769
And while it is interesting to us how our understanding is clarified, what really touches our heart is why it's clarified.

00:15:50.769 --> 00:15:58.419
Turn with me, please, to the book of Amos, chapter 3.

00:15:58.419 --> 00:16:01.419
And notice what Amos 3 7 says.

00:16:01.419 --> 00:16:13.590
For the sovereign Lord Jehovah will not do a thing unless he has revealed his confidential matter to his servants, the prophets.

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:17.590
Doesn't that convey Jehovah's confidence in us?

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:21.590
Doesn't it indicate his love, his loyalty?

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:28.590
Jehovah is actively involved in teaching his people, preparing us for what lies ahead.

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:33.590
He's providing us with the understanding that we need when we need it.

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:36.590
And that is reassuring, isn't it?

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:45.590
Because as we progress deeper into the time of the end, as Satan's hatred intensifies and his attacks increase.

00:16:45.590 --> 00:17:01.590
As we draw closer to the great tribulation and the destruction of Satan's wicked system of things, we can be confident that Jehovah God, our God, will continue to loyally provide us with the direction and the understanding that we need.

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:06.589
We will not be left without guidance, unsure where to go or what to do.

00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:11.589
We will not be left to stumble in the dark because Jehovah has said,

00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:19.589
the path of the righteous one is light, the bright morning light that grows brighter and brighter until full daylight.

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:39.190
Well, with these things in mind, I invite you to listen closely to the next two talks.

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:43.190
The first will be presented by Brother David's plane and is entitled,

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:47.190
Trust in the Merciful Judge of all the Earth.

00:17:47.190 --> 00:18:01.470
By means of an angel, Jehovah God told his dear friend Abraham that he was going to destroy the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah.

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:17.519
The angel said, the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is indeed great and their sin is very heavy. Abraham was troubled.

00:18:17.519 --> 00:18:27.519
He apparently wondered whether Jehovah had taken all of the factors into consideration before he made that decision to destroy the cities.

00:18:27.519 --> 00:18:37.019
So he asked, will the judge of all the Earth not do what is right?

00:18:37.019 --> 00:18:42.019
Well, we can understand why Abraham would ask that question.

00:18:42.019 --> 00:18:46.019
It was early days in his relationship with Jehovah God.

00:18:46.019 --> 00:18:57.019
He was just beginning to get acquainted with Jehovah and we can hardly imagine him asking the same question later when he knew Jehovah much better.

00:18:57.019 --> 00:19:06.269
But have you ever asked a similar question, maybe when you were just coming into the truth?

00:19:06.269 --> 00:19:13.269
Have you ever asked, for example, will none of those who died in the flood get a resurrection,

00:19:13.269 --> 00:19:17.269
even those who may never have heard of Noah?

00:19:17.269 --> 00:19:21.269
And what about Sodom and Gomorrah?

00:19:21.269 --> 00:19:32.269
Will everyone who died in Sodom and Gomorrah sleep on everlasting sleep, the women, the children, babies?

00:19:32.269 --> 00:19:44.269
And was there not one redeemable Assyrian soldier in that band of 185,000 who died at the hand of Jehovah's Angel?

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:50.650
We don't have the answer to those questions.

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:53.650
But we do know one thing.

00:19:53.650 --> 00:20:00.650
The merciful judge of all the Earth will do what is right.

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:04.650
Wait a minute, did I hear that right?

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:08.650
We don't have the answer to those questions.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:10.650
I thought we did.

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:21.650
In the past, our publications have stated that there's no hope of a resurrection for those who died in the flood or those destroyed in Sodom and Gomorrah.

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:24.650
But do we really know that?

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:31.650
The band of Sodom and Gomorrah were certainly wicked and they deserve to die for what they did.

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:36.650
But did they know any better?

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:40.650
They often did not, and his family preached to them.

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:54.650
And are we saying that if special pioneers had been assigned to Sodom, that they would have had no success whatsoever in preaching to the Sodomites, helping them to turn around and come to an knowledge of Jehovah?

00:20:54.650 --> 00:21:04.650
Can we say dogmatically that not one Sodomite would have repented if Jehovah's requirements have been explained?

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:10.650
And then there's the fascinating statement made by Jesus found at Matthew chapter 11.

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:14.380
I'll give you a moment.

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:17.380
Matthew chapter 11.

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:21.380
And we're going to read verses 23 and 24.

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:26.609
This is interesting.

00:21:26.609 --> 00:21:31.609
Matthew 11, 23 and 24.

00:21:31.609 --> 00:21:39.609
And you, Capernaum, were you perhaps be exalted to heaven down to the grave you will come?

00:21:39.609 --> 00:21:51.609
Because, and notice this, if the powerful works that took place in you had taken place in Sodom, it would have remained until this very day.

00:21:51.609 --> 00:22:00.609
But I say to you, it will be more and durable for the land of Sodom on judgment day than for you.

00:22:00.609 --> 00:22:06.609
It would have remained until this very day.

00:22:06.609 --> 00:22:15.609
Jehovah's angel had told Abraham that if ten righteous men could be found in Sodom, the city would not be destroyed.

00:22:15.609 --> 00:22:29.609
So was Jesus saying that if he had preached and performed powerful works in Sodom, ten righteous men would have been found and the city would have been spared?

00:22:30.609 --> 00:22:38.609
It's also of interest to consider Jehovah's words to unfaithful Judah in Ezekiel 16.

00:22:38.609 --> 00:22:45.609
Jehovah said that the citizens of Sodom were more righteous than the inhabitants of Judah.

00:22:45.609 --> 00:22:51.210
So if Sodom is doomed, what about Judah?

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:59.210
But what about the disciple Jude's statement that Sodom and Gomorrah would undergo the judicial punishment of everlasting fire?

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:05.210
Well, that certainly will prove true of the cities and probably many of the inhabitants as well.

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:09.210
But does it mean that there's no hope for any of them?

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:14.210
Jesus' statement we just read would indicate that there is hope for some.

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:19.210
We just can't be dogmatic.

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:27.210
But again, we can say that the merciful judge of all the earth will do what is right.

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:30.210
Now let's talk about the flood of Noah's day.

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:35.210
In the past, we've said that any who died in the flood would not be resurrected.

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:38.210
But does the Bible say that?

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:41.210
Now Noah's contemporaries certainly were wicked.

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:50.210
The Bible says that man's wickedness was great on the earth and every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only bad all the time.

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:54.210
So those living at that time were sinners.

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:59.210
But did they all get a thorough witness?

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:02.210
No one as family must have been very busy building the ark.

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:06.210
How much time did they have for preaching?

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:11.210
And were they able to do seldom worked territory?

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:17.210
We have found that people who live within ten miles of Bethel have never heard of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:25.210
So can we guarantee that everyone living on earth during that time knew of Noah and what he was doing?

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:27.210
We can't really say that.

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:36.210
And can we say that if someone had been given an adequate opportunity, he still would have turned his back on Jehovah?

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:39.210
We just can't say that.

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:45.210
Now of course if Jehovah didn't bring them back, they wouldn't have any grounds for complaint.

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:47.210
They've had life.

00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:51.210
And life is more than any of us deserves.

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:56.210
As we know when Adam and Eve sinned Jehovah could have destroyed them right away.

00:24:56.210 --> 00:25:00.210
But instead he gave them the opportunity to have sons and daughters.

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:03.210
And as a result, we were born.

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:13.210
So the fact that you and I have drawn one breath is pure undeserved kindness on Jehovah's part.

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:23.460
Now on the other hand, for many years it was suggested that all those who the Bible says were buried with their forefathers were going to have a resurrection.

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:26.460
A Solomon was one of those.

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:37.460
The Bible says of him, then Solomon was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried in the city of David his father.

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:43.460
Well, we reasoned that those who were buried with their forefathers were in the common grave of mankind.

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:49.460
And we know that the common grave of mankind is going to be emptied during the thousand year reign of Christ.

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:57.460
But we ask ourselves, when Bible writers said that someone was buried with his forefathers,

00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:01.460
were they really revealing what Jehovah's final judgment would be?

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:07.460
Was Jehovah revealing to them, inspiring them to say how he was going to settle the case?

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:13.460
Or the Bible writers really saying that this is the way the person was buried.

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:15.460
This is the manner of his burial.

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:20.460
Remember, in Bible times the way someone was buried was very important.

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:25.460
Joseph and Jacob refused to be buried in Egypt.

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:32.460
High priest Jehovah was buried with the kings of Judah because of all the good things he had done.

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:41.309
And when a prophet said that a certain king was going to have the burial of a donkey, that wasn't good.

00:26:41.309 --> 00:26:46.309
Solomon was the second wisest man ever to walk the earth.

00:26:46.309 --> 00:26:50.309
Jehovah appeared to him twice, and the second time he appeared to him, he said,

00:26:50.309 --> 00:26:58.309
if you and your sons turn away from following me and go and serve other gods and bow down to them,

00:26:58.309 --> 00:27:04.309
I will cut Israel off from the surface of the land.

00:27:04.309 --> 00:27:07.309
What did Solomon do?

00:27:07.309 --> 00:27:12.309
He began to serve other gods and bow down to them.

00:27:12.309 --> 00:27:16.309
How will the judge of all the earth view that?

00:27:16.309 --> 00:27:19.309
That's not for us to say.

00:27:19.309 --> 00:27:25.309
So we can't be dogmatic about the prospects of those who are said to be buried with their forefathers.

00:27:25.309 --> 00:27:30.309
It could be that the Bible was just indicating the manner of their burial.

00:27:30.309 --> 00:27:33.309
Now that isn't to say that they won't be resurrected.

00:27:33.309 --> 00:27:37.309
It simply means that we don't know.

00:27:37.309 --> 00:27:42.309
The righteous judge knows, and we know that he'll do the right thing.

00:27:42.309 --> 00:27:46.309
Well, what do we know about Jehovah?

00:27:46.309 --> 00:27:49.309
Why can we trust him to do the right thing?

00:27:49.309 --> 00:27:51.309
Well, look at the record.

00:27:51.309 --> 00:27:57.309
In the days of the prophet Joel, God's people were in a sick spiritual condition.

00:27:57.309 --> 00:28:02.309
They were worshipping the bails and the golden calves and sacred poles.

00:28:02.309 --> 00:28:08.309
They were lying, committing adultery, stealing, shedding innocent blood, oppressing widows and orphans.

00:28:08.309 --> 00:28:11.309
Jehovah had good reason to wipe the whole nation out.

00:28:11.309 --> 00:28:14.309
And yet what do we read at Joel 213?

00:28:14.309 --> 00:28:21.309
Joel says, rip apart your hearts and not your garments and return to Jehovah your God.

00:28:21.309 --> 00:28:27.309
For he is compassionate and merciful, slow to anger and abundant and royal love.

00:28:27.309 --> 00:28:32.309
And he will reconsider the calamity.

00:28:32.309 --> 00:28:41.690
He will reconsider the calamity after all that Jehovah was willing to show mercy.

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:45.690
Now this is very encouraging.

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:48.690
Why?

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:59.690
Many of our brothers have no trouble accepting the fact that Jehovah will forgive the sins they committed in their ignorance before they came to a knowledge of the truth.

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:10.029
But if they've committed a sin after baptism, they're afraid that Jehovah will never forget and he will never forgive them.

00:29:10.029 --> 00:29:12.029
And yet what do we see here?

00:29:12.029 --> 00:29:16.029
The nation of Israel was in a dedicated situation before Jehovah.

00:29:16.029 --> 00:29:25.029
And yet Jehovah said, if you stop doing what is wrong, if you start doing what is right, I will reconsider.

00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:29.029
Then you have the encouraging words found at Ezekiel 33.

00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:33.910
Let's read this.

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:41.910
And I find that this is a good passage to read to brothers and sisters who may feel that Jehovah could never forgive them for what they've done.

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:51.859
Ezekiel 33 verses 14 and 16, verse 14 first.

00:29:51.859 --> 00:29:57.859
And when I say to the wicked one, you will surely die.

00:29:57.859 --> 00:30:05.859
And he turns away from his sin and does what is just and righteous, verse 16.

00:30:05.859 --> 00:30:09.859
None of the sins he committed will be held against him.

00:30:09.859 --> 00:30:16.859
For doing what is just and righteous, he will surely keep living.

00:30:16.859 --> 00:30:20.859
Now, isn't that encouraging for someone who strayed from the truth?

00:30:20.859 --> 00:30:23.859
Maybe God involved in some bad conduct?

00:30:23.859 --> 00:30:29.859
And far too many of these are afraid that Jehovah will never forgive them.

00:30:29.859 --> 00:30:31.859
They would love to come back to the truth.

00:30:31.859 --> 00:30:36.859
They would love to come back to Jehovah, but they're afraid that Jehovah is not going to accept them.

00:30:36.859 --> 00:30:43.859
And yet he says none of the sins he committed will be held against him.

00:30:43.859 --> 00:30:45.859
The case of King Manasseh makes the point.

00:30:45.859 --> 00:30:51.859
He was in a dedicated relationship with Jehovah, and yet for most of his life he did what was wrong.

00:30:51.859 --> 00:31:00.859
But when he repented, turned around and started doing what was right, Jehovah wiped the slate clean.

00:31:00.859 --> 00:31:05.859
What a marvelous merciful God we worship.

00:31:05.859 --> 00:31:12.859
It shows that Jehovah will show mercy whenever he sees a basis for doing so.

00:31:12.859 --> 00:31:17.859
Now consider how Jehovah dealt with the people of Nineveh in the days of Jonah.

00:31:17.859 --> 00:31:25.859
Their conduct was so bad that Jehovah was determined to destroy the city, and Jonah was in agreement with that.

00:31:25.859 --> 00:31:28.859
Yeah, wipe them all out.

00:31:28.859 --> 00:31:32.859
But Jehovah was more merciful than Jonah was.

00:31:32.859 --> 00:31:38.859
And when he saw that the people repented and turned around, he was willing to forgive them.

00:31:38.859 --> 00:31:41.859
Why? The Bible tells us why.

00:31:41.859 --> 00:31:47.420
They didn't know right from wrong.

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:50.420
They didn't know any better.

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:53.420
Will some of those Nineveits be back?

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:58.420
Jesus' words found at Matthew 12-41 seemed to indicate that they will.

00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:06.420
He said, men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it,

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:09.420
because they repented at what Jonah preached.

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:13.420
But look, something more than Jonah is here.

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:16.420
So what do we see from these examples?

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:21.420
The men of Nineveh, Manassa, and others.

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:24.420
They were wicked. They did bad things.

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:28.420
They repented. They started to do what was right.

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:32.420
And Jehovah wiped the slate clean.

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:36.420
Well, today, power for judging has been given to someone else.

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:39.420
There's a different judge of all the earth.

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:43.420
And we read about him at John chapter 5.

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:49.910
John chapter 5.

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:51.910
And we're going to read verse 22.

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:56.150
I'll give you a moment.

00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:59.779
John 5 and 22.

00:32:59.779 --> 00:33:02.779
For the Father judges no one at all.

00:33:02.779 --> 00:33:10.779
But He has entrusted all the judging to the Son.

00:33:10.779 --> 00:33:16.779
Jesus has been given authority to judge the living and the dead.

00:33:16.779 --> 00:33:18.779
Well, can we trust Him?

00:33:18.779 --> 00:33:21.779
Can we be sure that Jesus will be merciful?

00:33:21.779 --> 00:33:25.779
Absolutely. He's the exact image of His Father.

00:33:25.779 --> 00:33:27.779
And the prophet Isaiah wrote of him,

00:33:27.779 --> 00:33:31.779
he will not judge by what appears to His eyes.

00:33:31.779 --> 00:33:35.779
Nor we prove simply according to what His ears hear.

00:33:35.779 --> 00:33:37.779
He will judge the lowly with fairness.

00:33:37.779 --> 00:33:44.779
And with uprightness He will give reproof in behalf of the weak ones of the earth.

00:33:44.779 --> 00:33:50.779
The authority that Jesus has been given includes the authority to resurrect the dead.

00:33:50.779 --> 00:33:53.779
He's the resurrection and the life.

00:33:53.779 --> 00:33:58.779
Now, you know, we often say that Jehovah God knows everything about those who have died.

00:33:58.779 --> 00:34:00.779
And that's true.

00:34:00.779 --> 00:34:03.779
But since Jesus is doing the resurrecting,

00:34:03.779 --> 00:34:10.780
it's reasonable to conclude that He also knows everything about the dead and the living.

00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:14.780
And He's going to be able to resurrect them accurately.

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:18.780
Now, whether He'll share the power to resurrect with His anointed brothers when they're raised to heaven,

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:20.780
remains to be seen.

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:23.780
We'll stay tuned.

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:27.780
Well, what's the takeaway from this talk so far?

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:30.780
How would you explain it to someone who wasn't here today?

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:36.780
You would not say someone who died in Sodom and Gomorrah and in the flood are going to be resurrected.

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:38.780
Has Solomon isn't going to be resurrected?

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:41.780
No, no, no, you wouldn't say that.

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:50.780
What we're saying is that we shouldn't be dogmatic about who will and who will not be resurrected.

00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:52.780
We just don't know.

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:54.780
But we trust Jehovah God.

00:34:54.780 --> 00:35:00.780
We trust Jesus Christ that they will do what is right.

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:05.219
I know what you're thinking.

00:35:05.219 --> 00:35:09.460
The wheels are turning.

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:11.460
And you're saying to yourself, come on, come on.

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:13.460
We've talked about the flood.

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:16.460
We've talked about Sodom and Gomorrah.

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.460
But what about the Great Tribulation?

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:23.460
Is there anything that we can or can't say about that?

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:25.460
No, that's a good question.

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:28.460
We should talk about that.

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:29.460
You know what?

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:47.530
I think my time is up.

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:51.530
It looks like I have to finish brothers by install.

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:56.530
And I don't think you want me to talk about anything else.

00:35:56.530 --> 00:36:00.530
So what is the takeaway point up to this time?

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:03.530
I'm sure we got the point.

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:10.530
It's hoped us to think about our loving Heavenly Father Jehovah as the merciful judge of the entire earth.

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:13.530
And His Son, Jesus Christ.

00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:18.530
Yes, we can trust them to make proper judgements.

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:22.530
We know that Jehovah and Jesus can read hearts.

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:30.530
And they have a long record of living by the perfect standards of justice that Jehovah has set up.

00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:35.530
So what about the future judgements doing the Great Tribulation?

00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:40.530
Is there something that we can adjust with regard to our understanding?

00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:44.530
Well, before we start to do that, let's be quite frank.

00:36:44.530 --> 00:36:51.530
Over the last few years, we've had a few changes with regard to the events that occurred during the Great Tribulation.

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:55.530
And if you've been in the truth for a while, sometimes it's a bit hard to remember,

00:36:55.530 --> 00:37:00.530
was that what we used to believe, or is this what we believe now?

00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:09.530
So to help us to make sure that we've got some idea of some of the events that occur during the Great Tribulation,

00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:11.530
let's look at this review.

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:18.269
What event starts the Great Tribulation?

00:37:18.269 --> 00:37:21.269
The destruction of battle on the Great.

00:37:21.269 --> 00:37:27.269
That will be the time when the political powers turn on the world empire of false religion,

00:37:27.269 --> 00:37:31.269
showing their disgust for this symbolic prostitute.

00:37:31.269 --> 00:37:37.269
This will lead to the destruction of all false religious organizations.

00:37:37.269 --> 00:37:41.269
What event ends the Great Tribulation?

00:37:41.269 --> 00:37:43.269
The Battle of Armageddon.

00:37:43.269 --> 00:37:47.269
That will be the final part of the Great Tribulation.

00:37:47.269 --> 00:37:56.269
Jesus, along with the resurrected 144,000 and myriads of angels, will battle with all those who opposed Jehovah,

00:37:56.269 --> 00:37:59.269
His kingdom, and His people here on earth.

00:37:59.269 --> 00:38:03.269
This will be the war of the Great Day of God, the Almighty.

00:38:03.269 --> 00:38:13.059
Now that we have the start and the end of the Great Tribulation in mind, let's ask a few more questions.

00:38:13.059 --> 00:38:17.059
How long will that time period be from start to finish?

00:38:17.059 --> 00:38:21.059
The answer is, we don't know.

00:38:21.059 --> 00:38:26.059
We do know that many events are foretold to happen during that time period.

00:38:26.059 --> 00:38:31.059
But these events may all occur in a reasonably short period of time.

00:38:31.059 --> 00:38:40.059
For this discussion, though, let's focus on the few events that will occur toward the end of the Great Tribulation.

00:38:40.059 --> 00:38:44.059
When does the attack of Gog of May Gog occur?

00:38:44.059 --> 00:38:51.059
It doesn't occur at the beginning of the Great Tribulation, but toward the end of that period of time.

00:38:51.059 --> 00:38:58.059
This attack on God's people by a coalition of nations will lead right into the Battle of Armageddon.

00:38:58.059 --> 00:39:02.059
So Gog's attack will occur just prior to Armageddon.

00:39:02.059 --> 00:39:09.599
When will the remaining ones of the anointed be gathered and taken to heaven?

00:39:09.599 --> 00:39:18.599
The Bible book of Ezekiel indicates that when Gog of May Gog starts his attack, some of the anointed will still be here on earth.

00:39:18.599 --> 00:39:28.599
However, Revelation 1714 tells us that when Jesus battles with the nations, he will come with those who are called and chosen.

00:39:28.599 --> 00:39:35.710
That is, all of the resurrected 144,000.

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:45.710
So the final gathering of his chosen ones must occur after the start of the attack of Gog of May Gog and before the Battle of Armageddon.

00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:56.150
This means that the anointed will be gathered and taken to heaven toward the end of the Great Tribulation, not at the beginning.

00:39:56.150 --> 00:40:00.150
When will the final judgment of the sheep and the goats take place?

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:13.150
Again, although we can't be dogmatic as to the exact sequence of events, it appears that the final judgment takes place at the end of the Great Tribulation, not at the beginning.

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:19.150
That will be the time when the Son of Man comes in his glory and all his angels with him.

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:25.150
Of course, there are a lot of other events that are foretold to happen during this time period.

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:35.150
But for now, let's just focus on these few events, all of which will happen just before the outbreak of Armageddon.

00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:38.150
What do we learn from them?

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:47.150
First, Jesus' judgment of the sheep and the goats and the destruction of the wicked will take place at the end of the Great Tribulation.

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:59.150
Second, there will be some of the remaining ones of the anointed on earth until the start of the attack of Gog of May Gog, right at the end of the Great Tribulation.

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:14.429
Third, the judgment of the sheep and the goats will include their dealings with Christ's brothers even during the Great Tribulation.

00:41:14.429 --> 00:41:18.429
So that is a review of what we already believe.

00:41:18.429 --> 00:41:24.780
So if you are writing down notes and you point, be careful what you say to others.

00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:31.780
But how do these basic facts, when we look at the things that occurred toward the end of the Great Tribulation,

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:38.780
how do they affect our understanding of Jehovah's judgments by means of Jesus Christ?

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:46.780
Well, we know that the closer we get to the Great Tribulation, the clearer our understanding is of what will occur.

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:59.780
Yes, our understanding is clarified according to the proper time and also in a way that will help us not only to endure the Great Tribulation but also to prosper during that period of time.

00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:06.780
So what we're going to do is consider four very interesting questions.

00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:13.940
Yes, and I've got some time left.

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:23.940
The first question is, once the Great Tribulation starts, so we saw there in the chart with the destruction of Babylon the Great.

00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:35.940
So once it starts, is there a door of opportunity for non-believers to actually join us in serving Jehovah?

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:38.940
Is there a door of opportunity?

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:40.940
What have we said in the past?

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:47.940
We've said, no, there will not be an opportunity for people to join us at that time.

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:50.940
Now, why did we say that?

00:42:50.940 --> 00:43:12.940
Basically, we viewed the account of the flood as being a type and anti-type portrayal and that we thought the fact that the door of the ark was closed prior to the flood coming indicated that the door of opportunity would close once the Great Tribulation started.

00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:22.940
But, of course, it's true Jesus did compare the time of Noah with the presence of him as a reigning king.

00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:35.940
But notice Jesus didn't say anything that indicated this was a type and anti-type arrangement and he certainly didn't mention anything with regard to a door of opportunity closing.

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:38.940
So let's think about that question again.

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:45.940
Once the Great Tribulation starts, is there a door of opportunity still available?

00:43:45.940 --> 00:44:01.940
Well, to answer that, looking at this time chart, remember the judgment of the sheep and the goats, the final judgment occurs when, not at the beginning, but towards the end of the Great Tribulation.

00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:29.940
So let's think about some that we know, perhaps, unbelieving relatives, disfellowshipped ones, others that have heard the message, perhaps studied with us, could some of them, once they see the destruction of Babylon the Great, decide that what Jehovah's Witnesses were saying is correct after all, could they take a stand for the truth?

00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:44.940
Well, if they changed their hearts and joined us, would we be disappointed? Now we can't be dogmatic, but we don't want to be like Jonah.

00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:49.940
And so, are not the doors closed? No, no.

00:44:51.940 --> 00:45:01.940
You see, we need to remember other cases and the scriptures that help us to understand how Jehovah as a merciful judge has dealt with people in the past.

00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:15.940
For example, think about the Israelites when they left Egypt. Please, if you turn with me to Exodus chapter 12, Exodus chapter 12, and we're going to read the first part of verse 38.

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:38.940
So here is describing the Exodus. And Exodus 12, 38 says, and a vast mix company also went with them. Now do you notice there's a footnote there and what does it say? That is a mix company of non-Isolites including Egyptians.

00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:55.940
So what happened? Well, during the time when the 10 complaints came upon the Egyptians, obviously some of these Egyptians started to see the distinction between Jehovah and the false gods that they worshiped.

00:45:55.940 --> 00:46:07.940
So when decision time came and Israelites were leaving Egypt, some of these Egyptians joined the Israelites. And that isn't that interesting for us to note.

00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:28.940
But of course, we might be thinking, yes, well, I understand why we said what we did before, but is it really the case that all these ones that we've stated with or some of them may have a chance to join us after Babylon the Great is destroyed? Is that fair?

00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:44.219
Last minute repentance. But you see, are we imitating the merciful judge of all the earth? Really, we shouldn't be surprised if that were to happen, should we?

00:46:44.219 --> 00:46:54.219
And think about it. As we looked in the time chart, we saw that this is a time period prior to the final judgment.

00:46:54.219 --> 00:47:05.219
So anyone who takes this stand for Jehovah early in the Great Tribulation will still face the attack of Gog of May Gog, and that will be a very, very difficult time.

00:47:05.219 --> 00:47:21.219
But now what do we need to note with regard to this? Well, just as in the first century in 66 CE, decision time came and many decided to go and leave Jerusalem at that point.

00:47:21.219 --> 00:47:34.219
Now, they made their decision based on what they already knew and had heard. So in a similar way, our preaching work today is of utmost importance.

00:47:34.219 --> 00:47:44.219
Let's notice what the Apostle Paul said is recorded in the book of Romans, Romans chapter 10 and verses 13 and 14.

00:47:45.219 --> 00:47:53.219
And as we read this, think about the context of what we're talking about when Babylon the Great is destroyed.

00:47:53.219 --> 00:48:02.219
So the time prior to that, we see it says in verse 13, for everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved.

00:48:02.219 --> 00:48:14.219
However, how will they call on him if they have not put faith in him? How in turn will they put faith in him about whom they have not heard?

00:48:14.219 --> 00:48:26.219
How in turn will they hear without someone to preach? Do you see why our preaching work is so urgent and important today?

00:48:27.219 --> 00:48:48.219
Yes, many take the opportunity to make a decision right now. But could it be that once the Great Tribulation starts, many who have heard the message that Jehovah's Witnesses have preached may be in a position then to make the right decision, the right choice.

00:48:48.219 --> 00:48:54.219
Well, again, we can't be dogmatic, but we certainly hope that that would be the case.

00:48:54.219 --> 00:49:05.219
Now, while we're talking about this, let's talk about the elephant in the room. What do we mean? Well, you know, some of us in the past, we're not going to mention names.

00:49:05.219 --> 00:49:13.219
But some of us have said, oh, you know, my unbelieving relative or, you know, I hope he dies before the Great Tribulation.

00:49:13.219 --> 00:49:22.219
Aha, we know what you mean saying. You said, because if he dies before the Great Tribulation, he'll have a chance of a resurrection.

00:49:22.219 --> 00:49:39.219
But during, but let's think about that. You see, does someone's eternal salvation depend on when they die or does it depend on really their heart condition?

00:49:39.219 --> 00:49:48.219
You see, the merciful judge of the earth knows their heart condition. And really, what are we thinking if we ask that question?

00:49:48.219 --> 00:49:58.219
You know, we imagine Jehovah saying to Jesus, look at this person, you know, they really should die forever. But look at it, they died now before the Great Tribulation.

00:49:58.219 --> 00:50:05.219
Oh, now we have to resurrect them. I mean, really?

00:50:05.219 --> 00:50:14.219
Jehovah is the righteous, merciful judge. He knows people's hearts. He can't fool him or trick him.

00:50:14.219 --> 00:50:24.219
So that was the first question. I'm sure you found interesting. Once the Great Tribulation starts, does the door of opportunity pose?

00:50:24.219 --> 00:50:33.219
The answer is, well, we'll have to wait and see. But according to the scriptures, it is a possibility that some can make a stand for the truth.

00:50:33.219 --> 00:50:42.219
Second question, when does the preaching of the good news of the kingdom finish? Good question.

00:50:42.219 --> 00:50:54.219
First start, let's remember, the good news is only good news to us and those who accept it. As Psalm 2 mentions over the rest of the world, it's never been good news, hasn't.

00:50:54.219 --> 00:51:08.219
So what does Matthew 24-14 tell us? It tells us that the good news is going to be preached and then the end will come. Let's look at that timeline again.

00:51:08.219 --> 00:51:16.219
What is the end referred to there? Well, it's the final part of the Great Tribulation.

00:51:16.219 --> 00:51:28.219
So that means that during the Great Tribulation, the good news of the kingdom will still be preached and it's still good news to us, but not to the rest of the world.

00:51:28.219 --> 00:51:41.219
That good news will become more hard hitting as time goes on, causing people to make a decision one way or the other, whether they accept the kingdom or not.

00:51:41.219 --> 00:51:51.219
So isn't that yet another reason why we shouldn't be surprised that some may make a stand for the truth even during the Great Tribulation?

00:51:51.219 --> 00:52:04.219
The third question, all those who die during the Great Tribulation, will they go into eternal death and never be resurrected?

00:52:05.219 --> 00:52:16.219
Well, initially we can say the goats, they're not going to be resurrected, are they? Because they're going to everlasting cutting off according to what Jesus said.

00:52:16.219 --> 00:52:24.219
And in 2nd Thessalonians chapter 1, it speaks of the punishment of everlasting destruction being metered out.

00:52:24.219 --> 00:52:30.219
But what time period are we talking about? Well, let's look at our timeline again.

00:52:30.219 --> 00:52:37.219
You see, this is referring to the time when Jesus comes with his holy ones.

00:52:37.219 --> 00:52:51.219
So looking at our timeline, what does it show us? That this is at the very end of the Great Tribulation when people are judged as being goats.

00:52:51.219 --> 00:52:56.219
Specifically, they have been given this judgment.

00:52:57.219 --> 00:53:12.219
But there are some other questions that come up. You see, these ones who are judged as goats, those who receive everlasting destruction, obviously have had adequate opportunity to accept or reject the kingdom.

00:53:12.219 --> 00:53:24.219
But what about those prior to that final judgment? So the Great Tribulation starts, we're not sure how long it goes, but each day it goes on.

00:53:24.219 --> 00:53:38.219
These people who know that will die. Do you realize every day worldwide about 150,000 people die, either of natural causes, of wars, sicknesses, and so on?

00:53:38.219 --> 00:53:45.219
So what about those ones? They're not actually killed by Jehovah as a punishment.

00:53:45.219 --> 00:53:54.219
So what do we need to remember? The merciful judge knows who should be resurrected and who shouldn't be resurrected.

00:53:54.219 --> 00:54:04.219
So we can't be dogmatic about those ones who may die at that time. We know that Jehovah and Jesus will do the right thing.

00:54:05.219 --> 00:54:23.219
Now, another final interesting question. Will all those living during the Great Tribulation have a full opportunity to decide either for the kingdom or against them?

00:54:23.219 --> 00:54:28.219
How would you answer? Don't say that aloud.

00:54:28.219 --> 00:54:40.219
The simple answer is, we don't know. And we don't need to know because we're not the judges. It's above our pay grade.

00:54:40.219 --> 00:54:49.599
But now there may be a little voice in you saying, but why don't we know? I've always believed during that time, that's it.

00:54:50.599 --> 00:55:02.599
But you see, each day, we mention 150,000 people on average die, 350,000 new babies are born each day.

00:55:02.599 --> 00:55:10.599
So even if the Great Tribulation was only a few days long, each day you've got more babies being born.

00:55:11.599 --> 00:55:25.599
And what about areas where the good news hasn't reached to the greatest extent? Maybe in lands where our work is restricted, we might be wondering, well, will we get to preach to every individual?

00:55:25.599 --> 00:55:31.599
Matthew chapter 10 verse 28, if you look at it later, seems to indicate, maybe we won't.

00:55:31.599 --> 00:55:34.599
So now here's an interesting question.

00:55:34.599 --> 00:55:48.599
Is it reasonable for us to say that Jehovah and Jesus automatically label millions of people as goats, even though they have never had a full opportunity to respond?

00:55:48.599 --> 00:55:50.599
Interesting question.

00:55:50.599 --> 00:56:01.599
If they haven't had a full opportunity and they die at that time, is it possible that they may receive a resurrection as unrighteous persons?

00:56:01.599 --> 00:56:12.599
What's the answer? We simply don't know. We can't be dogmatic and we shouldn't be dogmatic because we don't know.

00:56:12.599 --> 00:56:19.599
But rather, let's take comfort in what we do know and what do we know?

00:56:19.599 --> 00:56:30.599
We know that Jehovah and Jesus are merciful, that they will always do the right thing. In Ezekiel chapter 33 verse 11, what does it say, Jehovah?

00:56:30.599 --> 00:56:45.599
Takes no delight in the death of a wicked person. He wants them to change. And we know that Jehovah and Jesus will judge each individual in a balanced, righteous and merciful way.

00:56:45.599 --> 00:56:55.599
Well now at this point you think, wow, that's a lot to take in. Maybe your hands are a little tired from taking notes. Don't worry.

00:56:55.599 --> 00:57:05.599
An upcoming watchtower is going to give us all the details on this. So stay tuned. But in the meantime, what do we need to keep doing?

00:57:05.599 --> 00:57:14.599
We need to keep preaching the message to as many people as possible. We have no idea what results may come from that.

00:57:14.599 --> 00:57:27.599
And as we keep on preaching, remember, leave the judging to Jehovah and Jesus. They will always do the right thing, the merciful and just thing of that.

00:57:27.599 --> 00:57:48.429
We can be absolutely confident.

00:57:48.429 --> 00:57:58.429
Well, I was going to ask you, wasn't that exciting? But look at that applause that you've answered that question already. That was outstanding and so very touching.

00:57:58.429 --> 00:58:11.429
We thank you dear brothers for presenting those parts for us. Above all, we're grateful to our Heavenly Father Jehovah who continues to help us to see things as he does.

00:58:11.429 --> 00:58:17.429
And we leave so much in his wonderful hands and in the hands of his son.

00:58:17.429 --> 00:58:30.429
Well, next on our program, we look forward to viewing a new video entitled Become Jehovah's Friend. You are precious to Jehovah, isn't that fitting? Let's enjoy the video.

00:58:30.429 --> 00:58:55.320
Good morning students. This is your principal Rodriguez and I'm very happy to announce that soon we're going to have our annual holiday party. Isn't that exciting?

00:58:55.320 --> 00:59:00.320
So get ready for games, treats, and more. It's going to be great.

00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:04.320
Yay! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:09.320
Okay, everything is settled down. We'll see you all tomorrow.

00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:19.699
See you there, Sophia. Oh wait, you can't go.

00:59:19.699 --> 00:59:36.789
Well, that's all for today. Before I go, we'd like to announce the award for a student of the month, which goes to...

00:59:36.789 --> 00:59:44.380
Caleb, where'd he go? Wow, look at Caleb.

00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:49.380
That's my little brother. With Jehovah's help, he tries to be good in school.

00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:57.380
I like learning about Jehovah. Are you ready to study? Oh, I'll get my book. I'll meet you outside.

00:59:57.380 --> 01:00:11.789
Okay. Hey Zoe. Hey, what you're doing?

01:00:12.789 --> 01:00:17.789
Um, I'm just about to meet Sophia.

01:00:17.789 --> 01:00:32.329
Why do you hang out with her? She's so different, weird.

01:00:32.329 --> 01:00:36.329
She never does anything fun.

01:00:36.329 --> 01:00:46.280
You're different, Zoe. But in a cool way, you should hang out with us.

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:49.280
Not that, user.

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:53.280
Angela, please see me immediately.

01:00:53.280 --> 01:01:06.679
See you later, Zoe.

01:01:06.679 --> 01:01:10.679
Does it bother you that others think you're different?

01:01:10.679 --> 01:01:18.389
What do you mean? The other kids say things.

01:01:18.389 --> 01:01:22.389
Like, it's weird you can't celebrate holidays.

01:01:22.389 --> 01:01:28.780
And that you can't have fun.

01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:53.860
What? Of course we can have fun.

01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:57.860
It can be hard sometimes, but it's good to be different.

01:01:57.860 --> 01:02:02.860
Like Jesus. Like Jesus?

01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:07.860
Yeah, that's right. We learn a lot about him at Family Worship.

01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:13.860
In the Bible, Jesus said his followers would be no part of the world.

01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:37.929
What do you think it means to be no part of the world?

01:02:38.929 --> 01:03:05.139
That's a good guess.

01:03:05.139 --> 01:03:09.139
But we don't have to leave the planet.

01:03:09.139 --> 01:03:13.139
He said that he did not want to take his followers out of the world.

01:03:13.139 --> 01:03:14.139
But...

01:03:14.139 --> 01:03:17.139
That they should be no part of the world.

01:03:17.139 --> 01:03:20.139
That's right, honey.

01:03:20.139 --> 01:03:25.219
What else did Jesus say?

01:03:25.219 --> 01:03:27.219
They are no part of the world.

01:03:27.219 --> 01:03:31.219
Just as I am no part of the world.

01:03:31.219 --> 01:03:35.219
How was Jesus no part of the world?

01:03:35.219 --> 01:03:37.219
Let's see.

01:03:37.219 --> 01:03:42.219
Jesus was different from everyone else and so were his friends.

01:03:42.219 --> 01:03:47.219
He showed others how to be different and what they did.

01:03:47.219 --> 01:03:51.219
What they said and even how they thought.

01:03:51.219 --> 01:03:54.219
Really? How?

01:03:55.219 --> 01:04:00.699
People aren't always nice to others they think are different.

01:04:00.699 --> 01:04:06.699
But Jesus wanted to help everyone and that made some people very angry.

01:04:06.699 --> 01:04:10.699
They wanted Jesus to be more like them.

01:04:10.699 --> 01:04:13.699
But he didn't worry about what they thought.

01:04:13.699 --> 01:04:16.699
Because who did Jesus want to be like?

01:04:16.699 --> 01:04:18.699
Dova.

01:04:18.699 --> 01:04:19.699
That's right.

01:04:19.699 --> 01:04:24.699
Jehovah said that those who obeyed his voice were special to him.

01:04:24.699 --> 01:04:30.699
So when you love and obey Jehovah and you are no part of the world like Jesus.

01:04:30.699 --> 01:04:32.699
That makes you special to him.

01:04:32.699 --> 01:04:44.019
I don't know if it could ever be like you.

01:04:44.019 --> 01:04:54.230
What do you mean?

01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:55.230
I don't know.

01:04:55.230 --> 01:04:56.230
I...

01:04:56.230 --> 01:05:29.559
I gotta go.

01:05:29.559 --> 01:06:06.579
Jehovah, that makes you special to him.

01:06:06.579 --> 01:06:07.579
It's a leopard.

01:06:07.579 --> 01:06:24.739
Get away!

01:06:24.739 --> 01:07:08.699
We don't want you here.

01:07:08.699 --> 01:07:10.699
You shouldn't be here.

01:07:10.699 --> 01:07:17.699
Lord, if you just want to, you can make me clean.

01:07:17.699 --> 01:07:43.989
I want to be made clean.

01:07:43.989 --> 01:07:51.590
This isn't one of us.

01:07:51.590 --> 01:07:55.590
Jesus was different in what he did, said, and thought.

01:07:55.590 --> 01:08:01.780
I'm sorry about your grandma.

01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:03.780
This is for you.

01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:05.780
It will help you feel better.

01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:06.780
Thank you.

01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:17.569
And that made some people very angry.

01:08:17.569 --> 01:08:18.569
Oops.

01:08:18.569 --> 01:08:20.569
I didn't see you there.

01:08:20.569 --> 01:08:23.569
Are you okay?

01:08:23.569 --> 01:08:27.420
Let me help.

01:08:27.420 --> 01:08:29.420
Sometimes they pick on me too.

01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:35.020
People aren't always nice to others that they think are different.

01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:38.020
You should hang out with us.

01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:41.020
No, that is her.

01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:44.020
But Jesus wanted to be like his father Jehovah.

01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:47.020
And that's what made him special.

01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:50.140
Hey, darling.

01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:52.140
How was your study with Sophia?

01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:56.140
Mom, there's something I want to show you.

01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:57.140
Oh, okay.

01:08:57.140 --> 01:09:09.979
Enjoy the holiday party.

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:17.039
Hey, Zoe.

01:09:17.039 --> 01:09:28.380
Aren't you coming?

01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:33.680
Let me show you how it's done.

01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:34.680
Hi, guys.

01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:36.680
You didn't go to the party?

01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:43.039
I want to do the right thing.

01:09:43.039 --> 01:09:44.039
Okay.

01:09:44.039 --> 01:09:49.079
Let's have some fun.

01:09:49.079 --> 01:10:08.470
Oh, not again.

01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:12.470
Well, we certainly cherish these beautiful videos, don't we?

01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:14.470
Now, with that in mind,

01:10:14.470 --> 01:10:18.470
would you like to know what is happening at the Ramapo site,

01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:22.470
as well as the video production in Australasia?

01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:24.470
Well, you enjoy this.

01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:28.470
Let's give our attention to Brother Lat as he provides an update for us

01:10:28.470 --> 01:10:34.819
in his part that is titled Jehovah's Chariot is on the move.

01:10:34.819 --> 01:10:41.590
I'm glad you indicated you want to hear this.

01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:45.590
The second Samuel chapter 15, verse 1,

01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:49.590
tells us that Absalom,

01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:52.590
who was trying to usurp the throne,

01:10:52.590 --> 01:10:56.590
had a royal chariot built for himself.

01:10:56.590 --> 01:10:59.590
It was pulled by majestic horses,

01:10:59.590 --> 01:11:02.590
50 men ran ahead of that chariot.

01:11:02.590 --> 01:11:06.590
Now, as impressive as that chariot

01:11:06.590 --> 01:11:09.590
and writer may have seemed to many,

01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:14.590
to the celestial chariot mentioned in Ezekiel chapter 1,

01:11:14.590 --> 01:11:18.590
Absalom's chariot would be a sluggish,

01:11:18.590 --> 01:11:23.100
miniscule rattletrap.

01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:28.100
As we know, that chariot mentioned in Ezekiel chapter 1

01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:33.100
represents the heavenly part of Jehovah's organization.

01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:36.100
Who is the writer of this chariot?

01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:38.100
Jehovah himself.

01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:40.100
Why is he depicted this way?

01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:45.100
Well, Jehovah lovingly controls the movements of his organization

01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:49.100
to accomplish his will and purpose.

01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:52.100
No wonder Ezekiel chapter 1, verse 18,

01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:57.100
describes the rims of the wheels of the chariot

01:11:57.100 --> 01:11:59.100
as having eyes all around,

01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:04.100
all seeing Jehovah directs everything.

01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:08.100
What is the speed of Jehovah's chariot?

01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:13.100
Absalom's chariot may have been able to reach speeds up to 45 miles an hour

01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:15.100
the speed of a racehorse.

01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:18.100
But what about Jehovah's chariot?

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:22.100
Well, in the Bible, verse 14, chapter 1,

01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:30.100
it describes its movements in comparison with flashes of lightning.

01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:36.100
Now, a flash of lightning travels at 186,000 miles per second

01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:37.100
and the speed of light.

01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:41.100
But if we think about it, Jehovah's chariot is a lot faster than that.

01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:46.100
In fact, we could say it travels at the speed of thought,

01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:49.100
at the speed of Jehovah's thought.

01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:53.100
And obviously, that would be immeasurably fast.

01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:57.100
Now, we can't see into the invisible realm

01:12:57.100 --> 01:13:01.100
and see how Jehovah is using the heavenly part of his organization

01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:05.100
with lightning speed to accomplish his will and purpose.

01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:13.100
But we can see how fast things are moving in the visible part of Jehovah's organization.

01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:19.100
And that only makes sense in it because the earthly part is closely related to the heavenly

01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:25.100
and is actually reflection of the heavenly part of Jehovah's organization.

01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:31.100
Now, the foregoing discussion brings us to what Brother Cook mentioned,

01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:39.100
our updates to fast moving projects that Jehovah obviously is directing.

01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:43.100
And we're going to get brought up to speed.

01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:45.100
You like the way I use that, right?

01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:51.100
Up to speed since we're talking about moving, but things are happening.

01:13:51.100 --> 01:13:55.100
And Jehovah certainly is directing matters.

01:13:55.100 --> 01:14:00.100
And as mentioned, we're going to have an update regarding the audio video facility,

01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:04.100
being built at Ramapo, New York.

01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:12.100
Now, you probably recall that it's being built on property that the organization already owned.

01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:20.100
And it's conveniently located only two miles from a World Headquarters facility at Warwick.

01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:23.100
And a very interesting side point.

01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:29.100
The governing body tried for several years really hard to sell this property.

01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:33.100
With absolutely no results.

01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:41.100
Then we came to realize this is ideal property to build a much needed facility

01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:48.100
that can consolidate onto one site, the functions currently being done on many different properties.

01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:55.100
One site to produce our audio, video, and beautiful artwork.

01:14:55.100 --> 01:15:00.100
So just another example of Jehovah's eye seeing things.

01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:04.100
In fact, we think of his words at Psalm 32.

01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:06.100
Please go there.

01:15:06.100 --> 01:15:08.100
Psalm 32.

01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:11.100
And verse number eight, Jehovah says,

01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:17.100
I will give you insight and instruct you in the way you should go.

01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:22.100
I will give you advice with my eye upon you.

01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:26.100
Jehovah lovingly, obviously directing things.

01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:34.100
But I'm sure you'd like to see this video now that will give you an update on what is happening there at Ramapo.

01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:39.069
So enjoy the video.

01:15:39.069 --> 01:15:47.859
The specific purpose of the Ramapo project is to bring all media facilities under one roof.

01:15:47.859 --> 01:15:50.859
As a project begins, we always want things to move fast.

01:15:50.859 --> 01:15:54.859
But sometimes the reality is that it doesn't happen as fast as we would like it to.

01:15:54.859 --> 01:15:58.859
It's been several years of some pretty dynamic planning.

01:15:58.859 --> 01:16:02.859
And we've seen a lot of twists and turns and changes along the way.

01:16:02.859 --> 01:16:05.859
We've had a number of challenges on the Ramapo project.

01:16:05.859 --> 01:16:12.659
In the state of New York, there's only a certain season where you can take trees down.

01:16:12.659 --> 01:16:18.659
We're only allowed to remove trees between November and the end of March.

01:16:18.659 --> 01:16:23.659
And the town board approved this special permit for us to be able to cut the trees.

01:16:23.659 --> 01:16:32.659
However, when we went to exercise that permit, we realized that another agency still had to give their permission for us to be able to use it.

01:16:32.659 --> 01:16:34.659
Which we didn't get.

01:16:34.659 --> 01:16:38.659
Originally, we had planned about 12 weeks to do all of this work.

01:16:38.659 --> 01:16:42.659
And that 12 weeks included using mechanized equipment.

01:16:42.659 --> 01:16:47.659
If that wasn't accomplished, we would be waiting an entire year to be able to cut those trees.

01:16:47.659 --> 01:16:53.659
Well, the windows started closing from 12 weeks to 8 weeks, all the way down to 6 weeks.

01:16:53.659 --> 01:17:03.659
And then somehow something in the permitting language opened our eyes to a new possibility that allowed us to take the trees down in a different way.

01:17:03.659 --> 01:17:09.659
We got permission to cut the trees, but we had to cut the trees all by hand.

01:17:09.659 --> 01:17:15.659
And in 4 weeks, we used an outside contractor to take down all the trees that we needed.

01:17:15.659 --> 01:17:18.659
Two weeks early of the end of the tree cutting season.

01:17:18.659 --> 01:17:25.380
Every single day, there's still much work to be done to get us the needed permits.

01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:32.380
The design is continuing. The estimating for the project is continuing. That hasn't stopped. That hasn't slowed up one bit.

01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:41.380
Because of some of the delays that we experienced, there was a need to reassign some of our brothers and sisters within the organization.

01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:46.380
We had these willing volunteers. They were skilled. They were trained. They were willing to do whatever was needed.

01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:49.380
But we just didn't have the work for them at the time.

01:17:49.380 --> 01:18:02.949
We were able to communicate with different departments in the branch, at headquarters, and it just so happened that many of these departments had been praying for additional help.

01:18:02.949 --> 01:18:08.949
The brothers had a meeting with us and they said, we know you're not 100% busy, like you want to be.

01:18:08.949 --> 01:18:16.949
We'll be giving a number of you new assignments. Most of you, you'll go out for a while while we get our permits and come back.

01:18:16.949 --> 01:18:20.949
They said that I would be going into CDE, and I didn't even know what that was.

01:18:20.949 --> 01:18:25.949
Computer department engineering, and I thought, that's a way above me. I'm a construction girl.

01:18:25.949 --> 01:18:34.949
But actually, I've loved it. I've learned so much. And the team that I've worked with, I've gotten close to them. And it's been a wonderful change.

01:18:34.949 --> 01:18:37.949
It's really shown us that Jehovah is going to take care of us.

01:18:37.949 --> 01:18:43.949
For us to be at Ramapo was one of the most amazing privileges we've ever had.

01:18:43.949 --> 01:18:48.949
But we're still working for Jehovah and right in the center of his organization.

01:18:48.949 --> 01:18:54.949
These brothers and sisters are real men and women of faith, helping to advance kingdom interest in all these other areas.

01:18:54.949 --> 01:19:00.949
Obviously, when we hit some of these points where maybe we were waiting on approvals, the work did not stop.

01:19:00.949 --> 01:19:12.949
The time has allowed us to work with the Bethel departments, to work with the governing body committees, to work with our outside expert audio video design teams.

01:19:12.949 --> 01:19:17.949
And so, because of that, the buildings themselves have changed.

01:19:17.949 --> 01:19:27.949
It was looked into how flexible spaces be created, and also how could some of these spaces be shared, maybe between different departments, to make the best use of the property that we have.

01:19:27.949 --> 01:19:41.949
The art department will be in the same building with the other aspects of media, the audio part and the video part, so that when we need to collaborate, it'll be much easier to work together, so that we can make the very best possible product.

01:19:42.949 --> 01:19:47.949
It's a state-of-the-art audio video and our production facility.

01:19:47.949 --> 01:19:57.949
The process of designing that and getting it to stay ahead of not only the ever-changing technologies that we see in the industry, but also the needs for the organization.

01:19:57.949 --> 01:19:59.949
It's a dynamic process.

01:19:59.949 --> 01:20:08.949
The facility has been designed and will be constructed in such a way that if modifications need to be made later, to keep up with technology,

01:20:08.949 --> 01:20:13.949
we won't have to deconstruct the building in order to implement those changes.

01:20:13.949 --> 01:20:20.949
We've developed beautiful studios that will be functional not only now, but also for future projects.

01:20:20.949 --> 01:20:27.949
One exciting feature of the Media Center will be the use of video walls for virtual production.

01:20:27.949 --> 01:20:31.949
In fact, we've already begun filming with this new technology here at Patterson.

01:20:31.949 --> 01:20:43.949
With these video walls, we can create digitally backgrounds that can be used to give the appearance that we are shooting it in for a location.

01:20:43.949 --> 01:20:50.949
The governing body made it very clear that they're focused with the spirituality of those who are involved in our productions.

01:20:50.949 --> 01:20:57.949
If the friends have to be off-site for long periods of time filming, it can really disrupt their spiritual routine.

01:20:57.949 --> 01:21:05.949
Virtual production will allow us to reduce the need to travel or to even work hours that can interfere with spiritual activities.

01:21:05.949 --> 01:21:15.949
There's some circumstances that arise that can sometimes limit our ability to travel to another location, but with the use of the video wall, we won't be stopped.

01:21:15.949 --> 01:21:18.949
Video production will continue in the studio.

01:21:18.949 --> 01:21:44.060
Now we'll be able to custom make some backgrounds that actually look like Bible lands.

01:21:44.060 --> 01:22:04.060
And we're very confident with Jehovah's blessing that this new state-of-the-art facility will result in tremendous savings, efficiency, as we continue to produce beautiful video artwork to the benefit of the Brotherhood.

01:22:04.060 --> 01:22:11.060
But now that video that you saw was actually a while back a little time ago.

01:22:11.060 --> 01:22:17.060
We have some late-breaking news events to share with you since then.

01:22:17.060 --> 01:22:23.060
When you saw in the video the trees cut down, they were just lying haphazardly, weren't they?

01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:46.060
With the snow on the top, but since then, contractors have been very busy removing the trees, taking them out, clearing the site and preparation for other work that will come and all of this preceding this huge construction project that is looming just ahead.

01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:54.060
So we captured some of that work, and we also are bringing you up to date with a flyover video clip.

01:22:54.060 --> 01:23:57.619
So we want to show you this now, so it'll bring you even further up to date as to how things are looking.

01:23:57.619 --> 01:24:07.619
So you saw the trees being removed, you saw carving out the entrance there in the hillside, so a lot of exciting things are happening.

01:24:07.619 --> 01:24:17.619
Now soon contractors are going to begin blasting away large underground rock formations to prepare the site for further site work.

01:24:17.619 --> 01:24:29.619
And according to our current time schedule, and I think you'll be interested to know this, at the late summer of 2024, just a few months from now,

01:24:29.619 --> 01:24:41.619
we planned Jehovah willing with Jehovah's blessing. We're going to call in many more volunteers to help us to move this project forward speedily.

01:24:41.619 --> 01:24:49.619
But dear brothers and sisters, please remember to pray for Jehovah's blessings on these efforts.

01:24:49.619 --> 01:24:57.619
But now as we said, we had another update, and that's concerning the exciting project that is going on in Australia.

01:24:57.619 --> 01:25:08.619
And as you know, it's the series of dramas entitled The Good News According to Jesus. Please enjoy this video update.

01:25:08.619 --> 01:25:17.949
Now we'll be able to custom make some backgrounds that actually look like Bible lands.

01:25:17.949 --> 01:25:24.949
And so the Good News According to Jesus project is the perfect candidate for the use of virtual production.

01:25:24.949 --> 01:25:31.949
A video wall will be installed and ready for use at the Australasia branch in early 2024.

01:25:31.949 --> 01:25:43.090
There's many formats out there in the world of Jesus' life and how it's depicted.

01:25:43.090 --> 01:25:52.090
But how film is so accurate, the research and effort that's gone into it and has made it, so close to the Bible, it's going to make such a difference.

01:25:52.090 --> 01:26:01.090
They're going to say Jesus what he was truly like. They're going to affect hearts and it's really going to help them to see Jehovah as well.

01:26:01.090 --> 01:26:07.090
As we've been working with The Good News According to Jesus project, we've run into a few challenges to say the least.

01:26:07.090 --> 01:26:12.090
Right from the start, we had fires, we've had floods, we've had a pandemic.

01:26:12.090 --> 01:26:17.090
Due to a number of restrictions that were taking place at the time, things were delayed.

01:26:17.090 --> 01:26:20.090
They even came a point where it just completely starts.

01:26:20.090 --> 01:26:29.819
We did wonder how we were going to be able to produce this video and the time frames that we needed to do so.

01:26:29.819 --> 01:26:37.819
We had to pick and choose which scenes that we had to shoot first because construction was trying to keep up with our film schedule.

01:26:37.819 --> 01:26:41.819
So trying to manage those two together was quite difficult.

01:26:41.819 --> 01:26:48.819
Some of the challenges also are depicting miracles. How are you going to depict some of the various illnesses and diseases?

01:26:48.819 --> 01:26:55.819
How to film scenes like the miraculous catch of fish and Jesus walking on water in a realistic way?

01:26:55.819 --> 01:27:07.819
It's a weighty responsibility, but there's also the amazing joy of being able to learn more about Jesus just through the process of trying to put it on film.

01:27:07.819 --> 01:27:11.819
The Bible accounts that we are trying to depict involve a lot of animals.

01:27:11.819 --> 01:27:18.819
We know it was part of the culture at the time, so we're really trying to incorporate that into this production.

01:27:18.819 --> 01:27:25.819
We've had donkeys, shape, pigeons, and even camels here at the branch on set.

01:27:25.819 --> 01:27:32.819
They need to be trained to work with actors, trained to be ridden. They need to be familiarized with the sets.

01:27:32.819 --> 01:27:36.819
You actually start to see a bond established between the animals and the actors.

01:27:36.819 --> 01:27:45.819
Fortunately, many of our brothers and sisters at work in farmlands and rural Australia had many of these animals that they were willing to make available for us.

01:27:45.819 --> 01:27:54.819
There's a sister in a nearby rural congregation that has volunteered to help raise the pigeons that we're going to use in the temple scenes and other areas.

01:27:54.819 --> 01:28:00.819
The shape loved to be around kids, and I love to be around the cost members, and it really does make a difference.

01:28:00.819 --> 01:28:07.819
All of those animals essentially lend themselves to the realism of the sets that we're in and help bring the Bible accounts to life.

01:28:07.819 --> 01:28:13.859
So one particular episode required the Judean wilderness.

01:28:13.859 --> 01:28:20.859
After reviewing a few options here within the country of Australia, we saw that it wasn't as feasible as we would have liked for it to be.

01:28:20.859 --> 01:28:26.859
After presenting the information to our brothers in oversight, we got a response that we didn't anticipate.

01:28:26.859 --> 01:28:30.859
They came back asking, what about Israel?

01:28:30.859 --> 01:28:35.859
A small crew traveled to Israel and actually filmed in the real Judean wilderness.

01:28:35.859 --> 01:28:38.859
The local branch office provided support.

01:28:38.859 --> 01:28:44.859
A number of scenes were filmed, and now when reviewing the material, we see Jehovah blessing that arrangement.

01:28:44.859 --> 01:28:49.270
The backlog is a huge film set.

01:28:49.270 --> 01:28:51.270
It has five historical areas.

01:28:51.270 --> 01:28:54.270
We have the temple area and the temple slab.

01:28:54.270 --> 01:28:56.270
Jerusalem area.

01:28:56.270 --> 01:28:59.270
There's Kena, or Galilee.

01:28:59.270 --> 01:29:04.270
And then there's Capernaum, including a little beach area, and Nazareth.

01:29:04.270 --> 01:29:10.270
The backlog has roads, mounds, just landscapes so that we can have a variety of filming.

01:29:10.270 --> 01:29:14.270
It was designed in a way where you can point the camera anywhere.

01:29:14.270 --> 01:29:17.270
So it just helps you immerse yourself into the story and the life of Jesus.

01:29:17.270 --> 01:29:22.270
This is a world that you've never seen before.

01:29:22.270 --> 01:29:29.270
What's different about those sets there in Australia that we're typically using here is they have to last a lot longer.

01:29:29.270 --> 01:29:37.270
To cover the entire span of the gospel accounts requires many, many years of recordings.

01:29:37.270 --> 01:29:41.270
The brothers and sisters, they've shown amazing skill.

01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:44.270
And they've worked through some very challenging conditions.

01:29:44.270 --> 01:29:51.270
We've had heat, we've had rain, it's been dusty out here, it's been muddy at times, but they've worked through all of it.

01:29:52.270 --> 01:30:00.270
And whilst the end product is this beautiful set, it's going to bring the ministry of Jesus Christ alive in an incredibly realistic way.

01:30:00.270 --> 01:30:06.270
While construction was going, a contractor came in to the back lot to see the construction brothers.

01:30:06.270 --> 01:30:11.270
He spoke to one of the brothers and tears and asked, what was this all about?

01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:14.270
And we explained what we were trying to achieve.

01:30:14.270 --> 01:30:20.270
And with tears, he said, I come from Israel, and this looks just like my home.

01:30:20.270 --> 01:30:29.270
Seeing someone who has no idea about this project to come in and see how accurate it was really shows me how Jehovah is really looking after this project.

01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:34.270
It isn't any one of us that have made this a success. It's Jehovah the whole way.

01:30:34.270 --> 01:30:43.270
As we study these Bible accounts and figure out ways to bring them to life on the screen, it's teaching us to get into the motivations of who these people were.

01:30:43.270 --> 01:31:03.029
The goal is to take them from being just characters in black and white on the printed page into real people that you're going to know and love for the rest of your life.

01:31:08.659 --> 01:31:45.060
When we recount the tremendous amount of work that is being done to visually portray, depict the gospels of Jesus' life and ministry were thrilled.

01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:48.060
We're absolutely amazed.

01:31:48.060 --> 01:31:53.060
And all of this work at investment is not just for one convention drama.

01:31:53.060 --> 01:32:01.060
In fact, this production sets us up for convention dramas for years to come in the future.

01:32:01.060 --> 01:32:06.060
And you're going to truly enjoy them as they're rolled out.

01:32:06.060 --> 01:32:19.060
But now, when we think about these dramas, these episodes, you probably want to know, when? Am I going to get to see the first episode? When?

01:32:19.060 --> 01:32:33.060
Well, you'll be happy to know that next year, 2024, we're going to have them as portrayed into the convention program as two dramas.

01:32:33.060 --> 01:32:45.060
That is, episode one will be two dramas, the 2024 convention, the regional and the special conventions you will enjoy them indeed.

01:32:45.060 --> 01:33:04.000
In fact, we've prepared a preview of those two convention dramas.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:14.000
And I think you'll enjoy this a short to preview. I know it's really early to show you something for the 2024 convention.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:23.409
And I hope I don't get into trouble with a governing body for showing this prematurely just kidding.

01:33:23.409 --> 01:33:33.659
I hope you don't think I'm that stupid.

01:33:34.659 --> 01:33:42.189
It is with a governing body's full blessing and approval that we show you.

01:33:42.189 --> 01:34:08.090
So please enjoy this governing body approved teaser for these two dramas.

01:34:08.090 --> 01:34:27.020
Seeing that many have undertaken to compile an account of the facts, I resolved also because I have traced all things from the start with accuracy.

01:34:27.020 --> 01:34:41.189
Do not be afraid, Mary. You will become pregnant and give birth to a son and you ought to name him.

01:34:41.189 --> 01:35:02.170
Jesus, let your hover be praised, the God of Israel, because he has turned his attention to his people and has brought them deliverance.

01:35:02.170 --> 01:35:21.300
For look, I'm declaring to you good news. For today, there was born to you in David City, a Savior who is Christ, the Lord.

01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:30.090
Look, Jehovah's Slave Girl, may it happen to me according to your declaration.

01:35:30.090 --> 01:36:20.590
The true light that gives light to every sort of man was about to come into the world.

01:36:20.590 --> 01:37:04.329
The dramas over the next several years will have this kind of realism and will truly bring the gospel account to life, the good news according to Jesus.

01:37:04.329 --> 01:37:11.329
Now, what you saw was just a two and a half minute teaser, video, little video.

01:37:11.329 --> 01:37:23.329
But as we mentioned, we're going to, and that was just for episode one, but we are actively, speedily, fast, movingly, preparing more episodes.

01:37:23.329 --> 01:37:38.329
In fact, you'll be happy to know that we're working right now on the next four episodes, after the two that the one really teaser of the one you saw, four more are being worked on.

01:37:38.329 --> 01:37:45.329
And episode three is almost totally finished. We've almost got episode three done.

01:37:45.329 --> 01:37:57.329
The governing body has already been reviewing episode one and an early edition of episode two and how powerful indeed they are.

01:37:57.329 --> 01:38:10.329
And I know personally, I can say that I've been inspired, I've been motivated and even brought to the point of tears several times and other governing body brothers and helpers were affected similarly.

01:38:10.329 --> 01:38:17.329
The realism, the impact, the power is absolutely amazing.

01:38:17.329 --> 01:38:31.329
Well, we're confident that you appreciate receiving these two very important updates concerning significant fast moving projects and the governing body wants to keep you fully informed.

01:38:31.329 --> 01:38:40.329
They really want you to be up to date because we need your prayers, we need your support, and we want you to know what is happening.

01:38:40.329 --> 01:38:52.329
And we're confident that with Jehovah's blessing, then this is going to be something that's going to benefit the spiritual brotherhood in a tremendous, a profound way.

01:38:52.329 --> 01:38:59.329
And we were just so anxious to be able to give you more of this even though we gave you what we could now.

01:38:59.329 --> 01:39:11.329
But some might ask, why are we embarking on two projects like this when the New World is so close?

01:39:11.329 --> 01:39:17.329
We might not even finish one of them, the end may come. Well, we just don't know, do we?

01:39:17.329 --> 01:39:21.329
We don't know exactly when the end is going to come.

01:39:21.329 --> 01:39:31.329
Here's an illustration. How many carefully selected smooth stones did David take out when he went to fight Goliath?

01:39:31.329 --> 01:39:37.329
He took five, didn't he? I mean, did he need one? He just didn't know, did he?

01:39:37.329 --> 01:39:42.329
So he was prepared, whatever it took. Well, the same way we don't know when the end is going to come.

01:39:42.329 --> 01:39:55.329
Now, here's another thought, food for thought, could not these projects, if needed, be finished after the Great Tribulation and then used powerfully in the New World.

01:39:55.329 --> 01:40:05.329
And thinking of the good news according to Jesus' episodes, would they not be wonderful tools to teach resurrected ones about God's Son?

01:40:05.329 --> 01:40:19.329
Well, only Jehovah knows. Time will tell. But what did the watchtower say some years ago about the activity of Jehovah's people right when the end would come?

01:40:19.329 --> 01:40:35.670
Here's what it's saying. Let me read you this quote. It said, the arrival of the Lord Jesus to execute judgment will come at a complete surprise even to Jehovah's people.

01:40:35.670 --> 01:40:46.670
For it will no doubt find them at their busiest time of activity. So we're going to be surprised. We're going to be very busy when the end comes.

01:40:46.670 --> 01:40:55.949
And we say, if the end comes before we finish either one of these projects, then we say, Hallelujah. Praise God.

01:40:55.949 --> 01:41:02.949
But we're going to be busy right up until the end. Jehovah with his help and his support.

01:41:02.949 --> 01:41:12.949
And you think a scripture in Second Kings chapter 13 verse 18, Jehovah was not at all pleased with King Joach.

01:41:12.949 --> 01:41:19.949
Remember, he took the arrows, he struck the ground three times and then he stopped. Why?

01:41:19.949 --> 01:41:25.949
Because Jehovah does not like and he doesn't bless a lack of zeal and enthusiasm.

01:41:25.949 --> 01:41:31.949
So we want to make sure we're zealously working right up until the end comes.

01:41:31.949 --> 01:41:45.949
Well, in conclusion, we say with your continued support and prayers and our behalf fast moving amazing things are happening in the earthly part of Jehovah's organization.

01:41:45.949 --> 01:41:54.949
And we give all thanks to Jehovah that great celestial chariot writer we give thanks to him.

01:41:54.949 --> 01:42:07.949
And we give thanks to the heavenly part of his organization. How we appreciate the direction we are receiving by means of Holy Spirit.

01:42:07.949 --> 01:42:17.170
You keep clapping and I'll just keep smiling.

01:42:18.170 --> 01:42:25.170
That's wonderful. That was a very rich series of talks and we thank you dear brothers very much.

01:42:25.170 --> 01:42:31.170
And above all, we thank Jehovah for how he is guiding us through all of these wonderful things.

01:42:31.170 --> 01:42:44.170
Now, those of you listening, no doubt picked up on adjustments being made by the faithful and discrete slave based on scriptural principles in Jehovah's precious word, the Bible.

01:42:44.170 --> 01:42:52.420
Not the beginning of the program we mentioned it would there was a landmark annual meeting 10 years ago.

01:42:52.420 --> 01:43:02.420
And now with what we've learned today about Jehovah's mercy and his judgment as well as our personal responsibility before him.

01:43:02.420 --> 01:43:08.420
We see the power of God's word and its principles at work, don't we?

01:43:09.420 --> 01:43:18.420
So then this program too is truly landmark and as one of the branches wrote in it is indeed one that we will always remember.

01:43:18.420 --> 01:43:25.420
Now, it's fitting as we approach the great tribulation that we now have received a better understanding of these things, don't you agree?

01:43:25.420 --> 01:43:26.420
It's very good.

01:43:27.420 --> 01:43:37.420
As Proverbs 3 and verse 5 urges us keep trusting in Jehovah with all your heart, do not rely on your own understanding.

01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:48.420
And as we do this our Heavenly Father promises to make our paths straight and he is certainly doing that and we love him so much for doing that.

01:43:49.420 --> 01:43:59.420
Jehovah gets the praise for everything that has come out in this annual meeting and we give much credit to his dear Son our King Christ Jesus.

01:43:59.420 --> 01:44:05.420
What a delight to serve in this way under their guidance.

01:44:05.420 --> 01:44:13.420
We are sure you enjoyed part two of the annual meeting. It's always a joy to share this momentous occasion with all of you.

01:44:14.420 --> 01:44:22.420
Our postcard for this month is from the smallest country in the Western Hemisphere, the Federation of St. Kits and Nevis.

01:44:22.420 --> 01:44:28.420
St. Kits and Nevis lie in the Leeward Islands in the Eastern Caribbean Sea.

01:44:28.420 --> 01:44:33.420
The islands are known for their beaches, reefs and tropical weather.

01:44:33.420 --> 01:44:38.420
A channel called the Narrows separates the two volcanic Isles.

01:44:38.420 --> 01:44:44.420
Mount Lai Amiga at the center of St. Kits is one of the highest volcanoes in the Caribbean.

01:44:44.420 --> 01:44:48.420
Lai Amiga is the name given to the island by the Kalanago Indians.

01:44:48.420 --> 01:44:57.420
It can be translated as fertile land, a fitting description for how the volcanic soil yields abundant crops.

01:44:57.420 --> 01:45:02.420
But St. Kits and Nevis have proven to be spiritually fruitful as well.

01:45:02.420 --> 01:45:07.420
The good news spread to St. Kits and Nevis in the 1930s.

01:45:07.420 --> 01:45:12.420
During World War II, however, the importation of our literature was banned.

01:45:12.420 --> 01:45:24.420
Cartons containing the book's children and the New World, as well as the Watchtower edition of the American Standard Version Bible, were confiscated to be burned at a sugar factory.

01:45:24.420 --> 01:45:31.420
Two courageous brothers worked at the factory and saved enough books and Bibles for the congregation.

01:45:32.420 --> 01:45:36.420
When going door to door, our brothers generally don't knock.

01:45:36.420 --> 01:45:47.420
Instead, they call out inside to make it clear that they are looking for someone inside the house, not calling for someone on the street or in a neighboring yard.

01:45:47.420 --> 01:45:57.420
The people of St. Kits and Nevis spend much time outside the home, working or visiting with family and friends, so it can be difficult to find them at home.

01:45:57.420 --> 01:46:02.420
Publishers look for opportunities to witness wherever they are.

01:46:02.420 --> 01:46:12.420
Tourism makes up a large part of the economy, with hundreds of thousands that is many times the local population visiting each year by cruise ship.

01:46:12.420 --> 01:46:17.420
Many of these tourists will pass one of our literature carts.

01:46:17.420 --> 01:46:26.420
Since it's expensive to travel to another island for assemblies and conventions, St. Kits has what is called an expandable kingdom hall.

01:46:26.420 --> 01:46:31.420
For most of the year, it functions as a normal kingdom hall for two congregations.

01:46:31.420 --> 01:46:37.420
But for our three larger theocratic events each year, added chairs increase the capacity.

01:46:37.420 --> 01:46:42.420
Baptismal candidates travel to the nearby Timothy Bay for water immersion.

01:46:42.420 --> 01:46:50.420
The expandable kingdom hall also provides needed space for the memorial attendees, often three times the number of the publishers.

01:46:50.420 --> 01:47:00.420
The 326 publishers from all four congregations in St. Kits and Nevis send their warm love and greetings to the entire brotherhood.

01:47:00.420 --> 01:47:06.420
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is J.W. Broadcasting.
