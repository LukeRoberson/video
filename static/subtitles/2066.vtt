When you're in city life, when you're at home, everyone tends to start doing their own thing.

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.949
One's on the phone, the other one's on a computer, the other one's on TV.

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:31.949
You become a little bit selfish.

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.950
Whereas here, I believe, improved in some way and being closer together.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.950
I know what my daughter's favourite colour is.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:46.549
You know, it's my favourite colour now. You know, little things like that.

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:50.549
When my dad told me that we're coming to Ireland to preach the good news,

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:55.549
I didn't believe her at first because I thought it was just joking.

00:00:55.549 --> 00:01:01.549
We all started to put our clothes together. I was like, wow, so we actually did this.

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:06.549
I was really excited because I've never done anything like this before.

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:14.549
When I heard that Ireland is very rural, so lots of people don't get called on for years and years.

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.549
I thought that's actually quite sad, so I thought it was a really good idea.

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.549
As a family, we don't want anything to distract preaching the good news.

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.549
We want it to be the focus of our life.

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:38.340
So, going on holiday and incorporating the ministry as well is the best way to do it.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.340
It really is different. They really want to know about the message.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.340
They want to hear you out. They want to hear what you've got to say.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.340
Initially, we didn't know what we were doing.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.340
We used to numbers and maps, whereas here it's more, it's the next house along.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.340
It's the next plot of land along, so that was really unusual.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.340
You're given a road to do, and the ones you find are notting.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.340
You start drawing pictures and making your own maps as you're going along.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.340
The knees diagrams go back in the envelope for the next time.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.340
It was fun because we didn't know what to expect.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:24.340
I felt really excited, but really nervous because it was the first time I've ever done ministry in a different area.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.340
And people are much different.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:33.139
I'm very shy at the doors.

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:41.139
I'm trying to learn how to do it, and I think me coming here is helping me to be more confident at the doors.

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:44.139
The benefit they've been receiving our girls has been absolutely amazing.

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:51.139
Once they saw the how receptive the householder was, they immediately see how relaxed they were.

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:53.139
And they were ready and ready to go.

00:02:53.139 --> 00:03:05.289
First, it's all sunny, nice and warm, and then booth is raining.

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:17.020
It's like really hard, but still, it hasn't stopped us from going ministry because we know it's for Jehovah.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:29.020
The most fun part of the holiday was just seeing my family experience new adventures, new things,

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.020
experiencing a new congregation and all the brothers being so lovely.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:42.219
They didn't need a TV or video games. They've just had fun doing simple things.

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:46.219
I'm happy when we do things together.

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:51.219
And I think this trip has really pulled us closer.

00:03:51.219 --> 00:04:01.500
I'm always trying to find ways of bringing the family closer together, and this was a perfect way of doing that.
