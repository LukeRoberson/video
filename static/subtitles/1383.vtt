00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:07.330
Okay, good. A car's in the driveway. It looks like she's home.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.330
What did you plan to talk about with her?

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:16.329
Well, I placed the watch tower about the ransom, so I had in mind reading John 316,

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:21.329
and then considering a paragraph from the magazine that encourages Bible study.

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:23.329
Maybe I can start a study with her today.

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:24.329
Sounds good.

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:26.329
Okay, let's go.

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:31.989
Hi Mrs. Wilson. It's so nice to see you again.

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:34.990
In case you forgot, my name is Andrea.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.990
This is my friend Cindy.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.990
How are you?

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.990
Yes, I remember you.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.990
I'm doing very well, thank you.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.990
When I was here Saturday, I left you a magazine.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.990
I promised to come back today to answer the question,

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.990
what is God's greatest gift to us?

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.990
And how can we show appreciation for it?

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.990
I completely forgot that you were coming today.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.990
But I have a few minutes to talk with you.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.989
Okay, great.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.989
At John 316, Jesus told us what God's greatest gift is.

00:01:10.989 --> 00:01:12.989
Cindy, would you read that?

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:14.989
Sure.

00:01:14.989 --> 00:01:18.989
For God loved the world so much that He gave His only begotten Son

00:01:18.989 --> 00:01:22.989
so that everyone exercising faith in Him might not be destroyed

00:01:22.989 --> 00:01:24.989
but have everlasting life.

00:01:24.989 --> 00:01:26.989
Oh yes, I've read that before.

00:01:26.989 --> 00:01:28.989
Oh good.

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:31.989
So what is the gift that is referred to here?

00:01:31.989 --> 00:01:32.989
God's Son.

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:33.989
Be very good.

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:36.989
And God gave us His Son for what reason?

00:01:36.989 --> 00:01:40.989
So that we can have everlasting life in heaven.

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:43.989
You and I can have everlasting life.

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:48.989
Wouldn't you say that this makes the ransom the best gift of all?

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:49.989
Sure.

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:55.989
Notice what this paragraph on page 7 says about how to show appreciation.

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:59.989
Cindy, would you mind reading that also?

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:03.989
How can you show that you appreciate the greatest gift of all?

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:10.990
Recall that Jesus' words at John 316 point out that only those exercising faith in Him will be saved.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.990
Faith, according to the Bible, is the assured expectation of what His hope for.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.990
To have that assurance, accurate knowledge is essential.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.990
For this reason, we urge you to take time to learn about Jehovah God,

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.990
the giver of this perfect present, and to find out what you must do to enjoy the everlasting life

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.990
that Jesus' ransom sacrifice has made possible for you.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.990
So how can we show our appreciation?

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.990
By learning more about God.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.990
Yes.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.990
I wanted to show you an excellent tool for that.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:48.990
This brochure is designed for short Bible discussions on 14 various topics.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.990
Have you ever wondered about any of these?

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.990
Yes, this one.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.990
Why does God allow evil and suffering?

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.990
Many wonder about that.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.990
If you have five more minutes, we can turn to that lesson,

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.990
and I can show you how a discussion goes.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.990
Actually, my husband and I go to church every week, so that is not necessary.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.990
But I enjoyed reading the magazine you gave me.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.990
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.990
Which church are you going to?

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.990
The big one on the corner, just down the street.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.990
Oh, yes. I know where that is.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.990
Have you been going there for a long time?

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:36.990
We started going back to church after we lost everything in the big flood a couple of years ago.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.990
I'm sorry to hear about your loss.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.990
Our homes were damaged in the flood too.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.990
It's a real challenge to rebuild, isn't it?

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.990
Yes, it is.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.990
I really enjoyed our conversation, Mrs. Wilson.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.990
Be back and stop by from time to time to see how you and your family are doing.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:03.990
Since you're interested in why God allows evil, maybe next time I can show you what the Bible says about how evil began.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.990
Sure, that would be fine.

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.990
The best time to catch me at home.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.990
I was hoping that you could start a study.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.990
Yeah, me too.

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.990
But she enjoyed the watchtower, so I'm going to keep calling on her.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.990
Maybe later she'll be interested in studying.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:25.990
The question I left her for next time is actually the first one answered in the lesson she chose from the brochure.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.990
I can discuss a scripture too without telling her it's from the brochure.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.990
Do you have a call in this area?

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.990
And two, if you turn it the next corner.
