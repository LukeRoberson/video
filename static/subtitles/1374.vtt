00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:10.470
When we arrive at the Kingdom Hall for a meeting don't you agree that we all feel refreshed the moment we see the smiling faces of our brothers and sisters

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.910
That's how I feel

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.030
Sometimes we can even take our beautiful meeting location for granted

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.510
But did you know that a lot of work goes into making sure that our Kingdom Halls are well utilized?

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.789
The Worldwide Design Construction Department or WDC is tasked with analyzing our worldwide needs and

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.350
Providing direction to local design construction departments on how best to use our dedicated funds

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:45.759
As we approach the end of the present system of things

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:48.579
Jehovah continues to speed up the work

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.539
We now have more than

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.579
62,000 Kingdom Halls worldwide and the demand is still growing

00:00:55.179 --> 00:01:00.780
Jehovah's Blessing on the Kingdom work is undeniable as this could not have been accomplished otherwise

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.980
Many have been working for years in support of Kingdom Hall and assembly hall construction projects

00:01:07.379 --> 00:01:13.180
Most recently as part of the local design construction or LDC program

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.859
This program was implemented during the

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:21.900
2014 service here and unifies the approach for construction of Kingdom Halls worldwide

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.060
What has been accomplished since the program started at the end of the

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.140
2000 service year half of the publishers worldwide met in suitable meeting places

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:41.540
However the other half approximately three million publishers met in places that were overcrowded or otherwise unsuitable as Kingdom Halls

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.780
At that time 27,000 Kingdom Halls were needed

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.659
By 2014 the number of publishers meeting in unsuitable facilities had been reduced

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.540
But due to growth in the organization

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.500
This still meant that 1.6 million publishers did not have a suitable meeting place

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.379
Since 2014 that figure has been reduced by 25%

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:14.060
What accounts for this significant reduction in the backlog allowing us to catch up faster than in the past

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.180
Part of the answer lies in making efficient use of the facilities we already have

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:26.020
When providing food for thousands Jesus made it clear that nothing should be wasted

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.659
The LDC program applies that principle to the seats in our Kingdom Halls

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:41.180
As noted earlier, we have 62,000 Kingdom Halls worldwide on average only 60% of the seats are filled for congregation meetings

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:48.539
That means that approximately three to four million seats are empty during congregation meetings each week

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.139
There are a number of options to help make better use of these seats

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:56.259
Which will make the use of each Kingdom Hall more efficient

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.139
Consider for example a Kingdom Hall in an urban area

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.740
It has 200 seats and is used by four congregations sharing the facility

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:12.259
That means the Kingdom Hall will be in use for four weeknight meetings and for weekend meetings

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:19.300
It would definitely appear to be fully utilized and suggest the need for new construction for further growth

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.699
However, how many seats were in the Kingdom Hall?

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.099
200

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:32.539
Multiplyed by meetings for the four congregations this facility has a total seating capacity of 800 people

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.259
Global records indicate that congregations using this size Kingdom Hall have an average attendance of

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:41.819
120 at their meetings

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.819
This could mean that only

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.219
480 seats are used by the four congregations in this Kingdom Hall and

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:53.020
320 seats remain empty not very efficient

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:58.180
If the four congregations were redistributed into three congregations

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:06.819
average meeting attendance for each congregation would increase to about 160 per meeting while still fitting comfortably in that Kingdom Hall

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:10.500
And this would now allow for an open slot in the schedule

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:15.699
Which could be used to meet needs in the area without requiring new construction

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:19.540
In the first three years of the LDC program

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:26.660
fully utilizing our existing facilities played a part in reducing the backlog of Kingdom Hall projects from

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.939
14,000 to approximately 10,000 this saved millions of dollars

00:04:32.579 --> 00:04:41.060
Of course, this does not meet every need and there's still a significant need to construct new Kingdom Halls to provide suitable places of worship

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.100
How does the branch office make these decisions and how our priority set?

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:53.540
All options are examined as the branch committees work with their local design construction and service departments

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:02.660
Transportation needs such as distance opportunities for carpooling and availability of public transportation are taken into account

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:11.220
In many cases congregations can be sized to make better use of available seats in Kingdom Halls that have already been built

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:20.579
However, when they are needed new Kingdom Halls can be constructed using simple standard designs that make wise use of denated funds

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.379
Of course, all of this must be done with the big picture in mind

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:31.139
It is the spiritual needs of the congregations that are of the utmost priority

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.620
The structures themselves are not the focus of the centers of pure worship

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.540
But rather it is the people who use the facilities

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:43.220
On one occasion as they passed the temple

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.339
Mark 131 quotes one of Jesus disciples admiring the structure when he said

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.500
Teach us see what wonderful stones and buildings

00:05:53.459 --> 00:05:54.660
However

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:59.139
Jesus reply simply indicated that the building itself would not last

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:03.060
It was people Jesus was concerned with

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.060
Likewise

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.819
The Kingdom Halls that we built today will not last forever

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:15.699
But these centers of pure worship bring people together so that we can serve Jehovah as a united group

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:18.500
And that will last forever

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.420
Whether we assist in the construction of the many Kingdom Halls that are still needed or

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:27.860
Help to renovate and maintain existing Kingdom Halls

00:06:28.579 --> 00:06:33.699
It is our shared privilege to help provide suitable meeting places for our brothers and sisters

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.019
In this way

00:06:36.019 --> 00:06:40.579
We each support the faithful and discreet slave as they provide what is needed

00:06:40.579 --> 00:06:46.180
So that each congregation can praise Jehovah in a suitable place of worship
