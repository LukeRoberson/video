00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:12.019
A few things in life are more painful than the death of someone we love.

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:19.019
When my dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer's, I felt incredibly worried and anxious.

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:27.019
When he finally passed away, I had spent so much time worrying about him and thinking about him,

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:32.020
that I felt a huge emptiness. I didn't really know what to do with myself.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:41.020
Shihou, our daughter, died from sickness when she was 16 years old.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:49.020
She had a disability, so she was always with us, losing someone who was always there.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.020
You know, right here, in front of you, that loss can't be expressed in words.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.359
If you've experienced the loss of someone you love,

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.359
is there anything that can help ease the pain?

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:08.359
No two people experience grief in the same way.

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:12.359
But there are some practical suggestions that may help you.

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:17.359
These are frequently cited by grief counselors as being effective.

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:22.359
Number one, accept support from your friends and family.

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:27.359
I found it difficult to accept help from others because I felt like what I was going through

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:32.359
was so difficult that I felt like my friends wouldn't understand.

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:39.359
But when I reached out to my friends, they could do some of the things that I maybe had enjoyed with my dad.

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:44.359
And so it gave me the confidence that I wasn't going to be alone,

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:49.359
that I had friends that could fill that hole for me.

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:55.359
Our friends gave us upbuilding messages and lots of flowers,

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:58.359
enough to fill up this room.

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:08.189
Friends are a big help. They truly were there for us.

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:12.189
Number two, take care of your health.

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:15.189
Maintain a balanced diet.

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:17.189
Stay physically active.

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:20.189
Drink plenty of water.

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.189
And try to get enough sleep.

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:29.189
This is especially important when you're grieving because grief can be exhausting.

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:35.189
I found that if I didn't get good enough sleep, that it made things a lot harder.

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:39.189
I try and avoid being on my phone too much before bed,

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:43.189
and I try and do things that relax me.

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:47.599
Number three, be balanced.

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:53.599
Many find it helpful to alternate periods of grieving with breaks in their routine.

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.599
You might consider spending time with new friends, learning new skills,

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:03.360
or just enjoying some time off.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.360
While at home, I was a bit down and maybe a little pessimistic.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.360
But when I stepped outside, I noticed how nice the breeze was,

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.360
and I felt so much better.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.360
Taking moments to relax works.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:26.379
Number four, help others.

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:32.759
Many find it helpful to use some of their time to help others,

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:38.759
including friends and relatives who are also grieving the loss of your loved one.

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:43.759
Acts 2035, where it says there's more happiness and giving than there is in receiving,

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:45.759
really helped me.

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:50.759
So I tried every day, even if it was reaching out on the phone,

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:52.759
to do something for someone else.

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:56.759
And I found that that really helped with not just making me happy,

00:03:56.759 --> 00:04:00.759
but helped control my anxiety too.

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:05.759
Number five, remember your loved one.

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:12.759
Many find it comforting to do things that help keep alive the memory of the person they've lost.

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:17.759
We sometimes talk about her saying, she'll use to love if we said this.

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.759
Oh, you remember she liked this?

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:24.759
And remembering those moments, wounds are hot.

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:29.759
None of these things can completely erase the pain of grief,

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:32.759
but they may provide you with at least a measure of relief.

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:41.009
The advice offered in this video is in perfect harmony with principles found in the Bible.

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:45.009
Many who have lost someone they love have found that turning to the Bible

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:48.009
gives them peace of mind and comfort.

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:54.009
