00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:15.310
I remember and I had been able to experience many blessings from Jehovah

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:19.579
able to go on different assignments

00:00:21.219 --> 00:00:22.219
with

00:00:22.219 --> 00:00:25.219
Paraguay, Nigeria, Zambia, and

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.859
Then we packed up all of our belongings from home

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:36.979
Took up everything in our life and drove across the United States from California to Patterson and

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:39.539
Well then a couple of months

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.539
She was diagnosed with ALS

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:43.820
We were crushed

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:51.490
drove back to California and there we

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:58.049
Just tried to do everything we can to help her nothing worked and she passed away and so all this

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:18.239
Extremely difficult. She was my best friend. I received a

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.200
I got an encouraging card from my sister just help on me to try and keep moving forward and one of the thoughts in there was this

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:27.599
particular scripture in Psalm 18

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.079
verse 29

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.040
By God's power I can scale a wall and sometimes our trials feel just like that

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.680
They feel something that you just can't get over and it's impossible to climb a wall and there's nothing to grab onto

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:49.790
The trial it may feel this way to us

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.069
But again the scripture says that by God's power I can scale this wall

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.459
So sticking with the goal of pioneering

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:06.420
Help me to get moving and then help me to also

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:10.060
Want to try and reach out for other goals, which is

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:17.669
Going back to do temple work at Bethel. It's a privilege to be able to go to Bethel and

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.430
Every day you're working for Jehovah

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:27.289
It was nice to be able to be with the friends

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:30.490
They were always so very very encouraging and I know that

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:33.449
Working with them and working on a theocratic project

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.090
Helped to motivate me to keep moving

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:42.500
To feel more positive

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.020
It serves an elder in the congregation

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.860
So it's still trying to do my assignments and to try and be on shepherding visits and

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.860
Been something to keep my mind out on myself, but I'm I'm trying to to help others

00:02:56.949 --> 00:03:02.710
It's always encouraging to be out in the ministry and to be with the friends and they have different levels of

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.669
Anxieties and problems health issues and other things that they deal with when you talk to them and you

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.990
They encourage you to interchange of encouragement to be out in the ministry with the friends

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:18.469
Miriam and I always had a regular habit of

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:21.509
Personal study and we did it together

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.110
We left to bounce ideas off of each other and we would share points that we had dug up

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.000
Now even more so for myself. I feel it's important

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:38.199
Because it helps me to keep motivated to help me to keep finding those points and also

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:40.599
It's a good memories of something that we did together that we enjoyed

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:45.909
So I stick to my spiritual routine

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:52.979
But I also have a physical routine

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.789
I'll mountain bike

00:03:58.789 --> 00:04:02.949
three four times a week and to be in Jehovah's creation and beyond the trails

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.639
It helps me to be able to have time to pray and to meditate

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:15.240
And I can talk to Jehovah and be able to express myself

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.660
Jehovah what he has in store for each and every one of us is not what we're dealing with now

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.699
But it's going to be paradise conditions not have the issues that we're dealing with today

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:34.089
Jehovah's helped me scale the wall

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.209
help me move forward
