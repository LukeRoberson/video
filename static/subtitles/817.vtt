00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:07.200
So to answer the question, why keep on the watch?

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:15.199
There's a simple direct answer, but we have a second reason as well to share during this talk.

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:28.949
Fine Mark, and we're going to read chapter 13, and it leads to our main reason why,

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.950
but the context will really help us in verse 32.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:42.950
Let's read that, concerning that day or the hour, nobody knows.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.950
Neither the angels in heaven nor the sun, but the Father.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:54.950
Keep looking, keep awake, for you do not know when the appointed time is.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:01.950
It is like a man traveling abroad who left his house and gave the authority to his slaves to each one's work

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.950
and commanded the doorkeeper to keep on the watch.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:13.950
Keep on the watch, therefore, for you do not know when the master of the house is coming,

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.950
whether late in the day or at midnight or at dawn or early in the morning,

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:28.950
in order that when he comes, suddenly, he does not find you sleeping.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:37.950
Now that's our Lord and master, very direct, compassionate, true, but direct.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:46.950
And then the main reason why, verse 37, what I say to you, I say to all.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.950
So it's being repeated to all of us listening.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.950
Keep on the watch.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.950
Very simple, very direct.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.950
That's what is expected.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.950
However, and I appreciated it, it hadn't heard further Cook's talk,

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.949
move about the details and such, but in the emphasize for all of us,

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:17.949
we're connected here with Jehovah, a God of comfort.

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:25.949
So while it's true, we want to address directly sometimes the things that Jesus has taught us,

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:31.949
it doesn't mean that Jehovah is no longer a God of comfort.

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:33.949
He wants to comfort us.

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:38.949
So this is the second reason, and if you'll find Isaiah,

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:43.949
and we're going to read in chapter 48,

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:49.949
and it's a very fine thought about why, keep on the watch.

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:55.949
Verse 17, very familiar to us, and you'll see the point.

00:02:55.949 --> 00:03:01.949
This is what Jehovah says, your repurchaser, the Holy One of Israel.

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:09.949
I, Jehovah, am your God, the one teaching you to benefit yourself,

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:13.949
the one guiding you in the way you should walk.

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:23.949
Now, how we appreciate the footnote that adds depth to what Jehovah's saying here,

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:26.949
or for your own good.

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:29.949
Isn't that priceless?

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:34.460
Why keep on the watch?

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.460
It's for our own good.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.460
It really is.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.460
See, and that's the point, Jesus and Jehovah want us to take away.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.460
We're trying to address that with this talk,

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:52.460
because some of you have been serving Jehovah for a long time,

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.460
and I'm not going to stare at anybody, because I know different ones.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:07.150
And it's just amazing how Jehovah has been there for you all these years.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.150
But you're only human, and we'll address some concerns and some reason.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.149
I just wanted to have you think about this here.

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:23.149
Personal experience many years ago, my son's just in Paul.

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:28.149
We're in the early years of school, elementary school.

00:04:29.149 --> 00:04:32.149
And back at the time, I haven't heard it a lot lately,

00:04:32.149 --> 00:04:37.149
but from time to time, this would come up at a social gathering.

00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:39.149
No, mine, you're there.

00:04:39.149 --> 00:04:41.149
Second grade.

00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:45.149
First grade, but these boys were thinkers.

00:04:45.149 --> 00:04:49.149
So they'd listen, and they appreciated all these older ones,

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:52.149
and we had a number of them in Rhode Island.

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:55.149
Long time servants of Jehovah God.

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:58.149
However, from time to time, this statement,

00:04:58.149 --> 00:05:01.149
and they'd be looking at my sons and,

00:05:01.149 --> 00:05:06.149
oh, you'll never graduate in this system?

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:08.149
Not going to happen.

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:11.149
So, you know, I'm at their house.

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:15.149
They just fed us.

00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:16.149
Lord, help me.

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:18.149
What am I going to do here?

00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:21.149
But this would come up from time to time,

00:05:21.149 --> 00:05:23.149
at least during those years.

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:25.149
I was post-1975.

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:27.149
I don't know.

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:29.149
But they'd make these statements.

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:32.149
And I'm going to give you a big confession,

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:35.149
because, you know, this one comes clear to mine,

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:38.149
driving back from the gathering,

00:05:38.149 --> 00:05:43.149
just in Paul, or, you know, thinking in their trouble.

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:44.149
They're puzzled.

00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:45.149
What is this about?

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:48.149
Because, you know, they had goals,

00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:50.149
and what are we going to do,

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:55.149
for them is growing in their love for Jehovah?

00:05:55.149 --> 00:05:58.149
You know, is that true, Dad?

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:00.149
And so, I'd say, look.

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:02.149
You know, let me tie these people,

00:06:02.149 --> 00:06:05.149
saying these things, or long time servants,

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:06.149
experience people.

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:08.149
If any of you are guilty,

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:09.149
God loves you.

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:10.149
We forgive you.

00:06:10.149 --> 00:06:12.149
If you did that back then.

00:06:12.149 --> 00:06:15.149
You didn't help anybody.

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:19.149
But I'm going to give you a big confession.

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:21.149
So, that one particular night,

00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:22.149
we're driving back,

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:24.149
it was a little distance from where we were.

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:26.149
And they brought that up.

00:06:26.149 --> 00:06:28.149
They're sitting in the back seat,

00:06:28.149 --> 00:06:30.149
so we're having this conversation.

00:06:30.149 --> 00:06:31.149
And I told them, I said,

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:35.149
look, you boys remember,

00:06:35.149 --> 00:06:39.149
you got to keep on the watch.

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:41.149
This thing could go on,

00:06:41.149 --> 00:06:45.149
and be ready for it to go to 2020.

00:06:45.149 --> 00:06:47.149
Honest.

00:06:47.149 --> 00:06:50.149
I mean, we're talking almost 40 years.

00:06:50.149 --> 00:06:52.149
Almost 40 years.

00:06:52.149 --> 00:06:57.660
I felt pretty safe with that.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.660
But you know what year this is?

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.660
What are you going to do?

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.660
But at least, I'm happy to say they,

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.660
and my wife and their wives,

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.660
we're all still keeping on the watch.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.660
Have been and continue

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.660
to plan to keep on the watch.

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:26.660
Now, just something to address the feelings that some have.

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.660
And these are beautiful friends,

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:34.660
different ones worship in Jehovah for many decades.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.660
And we're only human.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:42.660
It's the truth, but we're only human.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:45.660
We're only human.

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.660
We're the only human.

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:53.660
One brother wrote

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.660
and appreciated sincerity.

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.660
And he said,

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:02.660
during the annual meeting of 2019,

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.660
the Ramapoh project was announced.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.660
And if I remember right,

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:11.660
it was stated that the project would be complete in a few years.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.899
beautiful expression, but words are powerful.

00:08:15.899 --> 00:08:18.860
It seemed a little disappointing

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:23.740
that this may push Armageddon off a few years.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:27.300
This was his sincere concern, really.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:30.939
And you know he's not alone.

00:08:30.939 --> 00:08:33.740
They're only human.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:36.299
Well, how should we respond?

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:38.940
Brother writes that in.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:43.779
Well, remember Jehovah is a God of comfort.

00:08:43.779 --> 00:08:45.340
You want to go direct?

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.940
It's what we address there with what Jesus told us.

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:53.820
But how can we comfort him too?

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:57.620
Rather bring the truth as it is and be straight with it.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:04.419
But the governing body wants all of you to know,

00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:07.259
including those that will see it later,

00:09:07.299 --> 00:09:11.659
that we are determined to remain active

00:09:11.659 --> 00:09:15.220
and to faithfully deliver spiritual food

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:18.220
at the right time.

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:23.019
We are also looking beyond the last days.

00:09:23.019 --> 00:09:25.779
You're getting that message.

00:09:25.779 --> 00:09:28.860
Let me expound on that thought.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.860
Looking beyond the last days.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:35.980
And this is a quote from the Proclaimers book.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:38.580
And I treasured it when the book came out

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:42.100
and a lot of work went into that publication.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:45.539
But there, referring to God's people,

00:09:45.539 --> 00:09:48.299
it stated, you know,

00:09:48.299 --> 00:09:50.740
there's a lot of international construction going on

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:55.299
at the time too, if you were in the truth then, quoting it now.

00:09:55.299 --> 00:09:58.139
With the help of Jehovah's spirit,

00:09:58.139 --> 00:10:01.379
they and God's people want to give the greatest witness

00:10:01.379 --> 00:10:06.379
possible during the time that remains before Armageddon.

00:10:06.379 --> 00:10:12.379
They are convinced that God's new world is very close at hand.

00:10:12.379 --> 00:10:15.899
And they have faith that they will survive

00:10:15.899 --> 00:10:19.899
as an organized people into the new world

00:10:19.899 --> 00:10:23.980
under the rule of God's Messianic Kingdom.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:29.740
Now, please note the rest of this quote.

00:10:29.779 --> 00:10:35.139
It is also their hope that perhaps, keyword,

00:10:35.139 --> 00:10:38.539
many of the fine facilities that they have built

00:10:38.539 --> 00:10:42.179
and dedicated to Jehovah will continue to be used

00:10:42.179 --> 00:10:46.940
after Armageddon as centers from which knowledge

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:49.659
of the only true God can be diffused

00:10:49.659 --> 00:10:52.340
until it truly fills the earth.

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:55.899
End quote, beautiful thought.

00:10:55.899 --> 00:10:59.340
Right there, still valid.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:04.340
So in harmony with what the faithful slave said then,

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:08.940
the faithful slave now says many of the projects

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:14.779
that are being worked on now like Ramaphob and the good news

00:11:14.779 --> 00:11:17.220
according to Jesus' video series,

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:23.720
may or perhaps will carry over into the new world

00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:29.240
to assist the great crowd with the work ahead

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:34.200
and perhaps including resurrected ones.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.159
That's comforting.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:40.440
That's just, you have to let them sink in.

00:11:41.799 --> 00:11:46.120
Now, we want to conclude with expressions

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:51.120
from two friends of mine, long time,

00:11:51.159 --> 00:11:56.159
hardworking supporters of the faithful slave for decades.

00:11:56.519 --> 00:11:59.159
I love these men and we're keeping anonymous.

00:11:59.159 --> 00:12:04.159
But I asked them to write their personal feelings

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.679
as they've been supporting the slave

00:12:07.679 --> 00:12:09.159
for all these decades.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:15.200
How have they benefited from keeping on the watch?

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:21.440
So here's what the first one said,

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:25.159
I come from a long line of people who believed

00:12:25.159 --> 00:12:27.519
in keeping an expectation of the end.

00:12:28.879 --> 00:12:31.200
My mother died just last year

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:36.519
and she always felt that the end was closer to the end.

00:12:36.519 --> 00:12:41.519
She just knew that she would live to see it, but she didn't.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.200
She had first learned the truth from her mother and law,

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.840
my grandmother, and anointed Christian

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:52.200
who often told me that she hoped to see the income

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.000
in her lifetime.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000
She didn't.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.960
She had learned the truth from her mother

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.360
who died when I was a teenager

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:04.759
and firmly believed she would see the end in her lifetime.

00:13:04.759 --> 00:13:05.799
She didn't.

00:13:06.759 --> 00:13:08.720
And she, my great grandmother,

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:11.000
had learned the truth from her mother and law

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.639
who died long before I was born

00:13:13.639 --> 00:13:16.480
and surely felt the same way about seeing the end.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.480
She didn't.

00:13:19.559 --> 00:13:23.960
And here I am now in my seventh decade of life.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:29.330
Firmly believing that I will see the end very soon.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:30.730
So what does that mean?

00:13:32.529 --> 00:13:34.809
That I'm just another one in a long line

00:13:34.809 --> 00:13:36.129
of delusional people?

00:13:36.129 --> 00:13:40.049
I don't think so.

00:13:41.049 --> 00:13:42.649
For two reasons.

00:13:42.649 --> 00:13:47.210
One, the evidence at the end is near keeps growing.

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:49.090
I've seen signs of the end

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:51.450
that even my mother never saw

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:54.009
such as the recent pandemic.

00:13:54.009 --> 00:13:57.690
Sometimes I compare myself to a man living in Judea

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:00.049
around the year 608 BCE.

00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:04.370
Such a man might have come from a long line

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:07.450
of faithful people who had listened to the prophets

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:09.090
and thought that the end was near

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:11.970
over a century earlier,

00:14:13.889 --> 00:14:15.690
hearing these things.

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:19.289
Maybe his great grandparents might have heard Isaiah speak,

00:14:19.289 --> 00:14:24.669
leading them to conclude the Jerusalem's end was near.

00:14:24.669 --> 00:14:27.750
Should that man decide that his family had been deluded

00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:32.429
just because they hadn't seen the destruction of Jerusalem?

00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:34.350
No.

00:14:35.429 --> 00:14:39.149
Jerusalem was destroyed in 607.

00:14:39.149 --> 00:14:44.149
So he's living in 608 having these concerns months later

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:47.470
it happens.

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:51.389
But more importantly, that man would know

00:14:51.389 --> 00:14:54.230
that his faithful family were good people

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:55.909
who lived good lives.

00:14:55.909 --> 00:14:57.789
They loved Jehovah

00:14:57.789 --> 00:15:00.389
and they saw the truth of Isaiah's words.

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:06.200
God teaches us to benefit ourselves.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.440
And that's the second reason why I don't feel

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.120
that I've been deluded

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.159
or that my faithful family members have been.

00:15:14.159 --> 00:15:15.600
Each one who served Jehovah

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:19.080
led a good, productive, useful life.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:22.559
They were not just sitting around waiting for the end.

00:15:22.559 --> 00:15:24.799
They always had projects that kept them busy

00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:26.360
and Jehovah's service,

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:30.480
goals in personal study and preaching and helping others.

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:34.000
So they were full of purpose and joy.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.720
I want the same kind of life.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:41.480
Also, I can hardly wait to tell my mother it's touching

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.159
just how close the end was

00:15:44.159 --> 00:15:46.200
when she finally closed her eyes.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:51.919
I know she will want to hear all about it.

00:15:52.879 --> 00:15:54.639
See, very touching.

00:15:54.639 --> 00:15:57.840
And I second brother to him about how

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.240
keeping on the watch has benefited him.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.639
My mom raised my brother me in the truth.

00:16:04.639 --> 00:16:07.279
She often expressed to us her confidence

00:16:07.279 --> 00:16:10.240
that the end is just around the corner.

00:16:11.759 --> 00:16:14.759
She didn't just say it, she lived it.

00:16:14.759 --> 00:16:17.159
She devoted herself to the ministry

00:16:17.159 --> 00:16:20.120
so that she could help others to serve Jehovah

00:16:20.159 --> 00:16:22.879
while there is still time.

00:16:22.879 --> 00:16:25.519
She kept an expectation of the end

00:16:25.519 --> 00:16:29.679
doing so year after year until she died.

00:16:30.679 --> 00:16:33.840
Now I'm approaching the age of my mother when she died.

00:16:35.159 --> 00:16:37.919
I've been keeping on the watch for over 50 years now.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:42.080
Am I bitter because the end has not yet come?

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:44.080
No, not at all.

00:16:45.519 --> 00:16:46.960
How could I be?

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.519
I've lived a full and satisfying life

00:16:49.519 --> 00:16:52.519
by living according to Jehovah's standards.

00:16:52.519 --> 00:16:55.720
Why would I want to live any other way?

00:16:56.679 --> 00:16:59.120
What has helped me to keep positive while waiting

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.320
for the end to come?

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.639
From time to time I reflect on these few things

00:17:03.639 --> 00:17:05.240
and here they are.

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:10.240
My dedication is unconditional and unending.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.920
I did not dedicate myself to Jehovah

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.400
on the condition that he brings the end

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.480
within my lifetime.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.279
Or even on the condition that he gives me

00:17:19.279 --> 00:17:24.279
a reward, I dedicated myself to him forever.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:29.640
And next, I must keep the big picture in mind.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:32.920
I don't want to make the mistake of focusing only

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.440
on what the end will mean for me,

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.359
the prospect of surviving into the new world.

00:17:41.119 --> 00:17:44.799
Rather, I must focus on something far more important

00:17:44.799 --> 00:17:48.039
what the end will mean for Jehovah,

00:17:48.079 --> 00:17:50.799
the sanctification of his name,

00:17:50.799 --> 00:17:53.759
knowing how important that is to him,

00:17:53.759 --> 00:17:58.759
I can be sure that it will happen in his due time.

00:17:59.759 --> 00:18:01.599
And then finally,

00:18:01.599 --> 00:18:05.200
meanwhile, I must endure to the end.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.359
That means to the end of this system

00:18:08.319 --> 00:18:11.799
or the end of my life, whichever comes first.

00:18:11.799 --> 00:18:15.880
Either way, the older I get, the closer I am to the end.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.599
What if like my mom, I don't live to see it?

00:18:20.759 --> 00:18:21.880
No worries.

00:18:24.279 --> 00:18:27.319
The moment I close my eyes in death,

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.599
my next conscious thought will be opening my eyes

00:18:32.599 --> 00:18:33.720
in the new world.

00:18:34.599 --> 00:18:36.680
Then it really won't matter

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:40.799
whether I live to see the end or not.

00:18:41.759 --> 00:18:46.759
Beautiful expressions of two beautiful spiritual men.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.319
So the question to conclude,

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:53.279
will this be the last

00:18:54.559 --> 00:18:55.559
annual meeting

00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:01.250
before the great tribulation?

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:02.730
Nobody raised their hand.

00:19:04.569 --> 00:19:07.279
We don't know.

00:19:07.279 --> 00:19:12.279
But what we do know is that Jehovah and Jesus

00:19:12.319 --> 00:19:16.400
want us to keep on the watch

00:19:17.599 --> 00:19:21.480
and it's for our own good to do so.
