00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.889
Okay kids, settle down.

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:10.890
For those of you that participated in the science club this weekend,

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.890
we will be having another camping trip.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.890
Hey, Sophia, we need you in our club.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.890
You're good at science.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.890
We have another trip coming up.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.859
It sounded like a war of fun.

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:29.859
Jehovah wants you and me to have friends.

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:32.859
But the question you need to ask yourself is,

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:34.859
who should be my friend?

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:41.799
And how can you know if someone should be your friend?

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:53.090
Please help me find a good friend.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.090
Someone who loves you.
