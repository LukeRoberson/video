00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.219
He wrote about one-quarter of the Christian Greek scriptures.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.820
That's almost as much as the Apostle Paul.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.619
His name is only mentioned three times,

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.420
and there are scarcely four words that are used to describe him.

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:24.539
The physician Luke is one of the most familiar names of whom we know almost nothing about.

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.539
In a world of people trying to look important,

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.340
Luke shows us what is important.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.539
Let's see what we can learn from the physician Luke.

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:41.939
The first mention of him, the first description of Luke,

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:44.939
is found in the book of Colossians chapter 3, verse 14,

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.740
and the Apostle Paul describes him there as the beloved physician.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.340
Physician, we focused on that when we considered the gospel of Luke,

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.740
Luke uses medical terms as he writes.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.939
But Luke was more than just a physician by occupation.

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:06.739
Luke was a physician in spirit.

00:01:06.739 --> 00:01:09.939
He had the heart of a physician, the heart of a healer.

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.310
Let's look at an example.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.709
Turn with me, please, to the book of Luke chapter 4.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.620
Luke 4 verses 38 and 39.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
38 says, after leaving the synagogue,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.859
he, that's Jesus, entered into Simon's home.

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:35.859
Now Simon's mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever.

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:38.260
And they asked him to help her.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.260
So he stood over her and rebuked the fever and it left her instantly.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
She got up and began ministering to them.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.659
There we have a mention in verse 38, Luke noted that she had a high fever.

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:53.060
But look a little closer.

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:55.659
What made an impression on Luke?

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.659
Was it just the high fever?

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:04.260
The verse says, Simon's mother-in-law was suffering with a high fever.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.259
Matthew didn't say that, Mark didn't say that.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.259
Luke noticed.

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:12.659
Look at another example.

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:15.860
Luke 22, verse 44.

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:20.360
Luke 22, 44.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.560
The account is in the Garden of Gethsemane and Jesus was there praying.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.960
But notice what Luke wrote, what caught his attention, verse 44.

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:36.360
But he was in such agony that he kept praying more earnestly and his sweat became as drops of blood.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.360
Falling to the ground, the physician Luke noticed the condition

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.759
that his sweat became as drops of blood.

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:54.159
But look again, it says that he was in such agony that his sweat became as drops of blood.

00:02:55.759 --> 00:03:02.960
Jesus conditioned his agony is what caught Luke's attention, not just the physical condition, the medical condition.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.759
You see, Luke records Jesus as someone who saw men as they were.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.759
He saw men without distinction.

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:14.159
He saw men and he loved them all.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.560
Luke shows Jesus as someone whose heart goes out to everyone for whom life is an unequal struggle.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.159
That made an impression on Luke.

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:28.159
Think of Luke's gospel, the things that are uniquely recorded in Luke.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.759
It's only Luke who tells us about the aged Elizabeth Sinzekeriah.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.560
Luke tells us about Anna in Simeon.

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:40.560
Luke tells us about the widow of name, the woman bent over for 18 years.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:52.159
The woman who anointed the feet of Jesus with her tears, the Samaritan leper, the rich tax collectors of chaos, the condemned thief who hung beside Jesus.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.759
Those Jesus added to towards these people appealed to Luke.

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:02.560
And part of me, Luke shared Jesus' view.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.759
For Luke too, men of all sorts are in the embrace of God's mercy.

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:17.160
And this attitude of heart and mind made Luke be loved, the beloved physician.

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:25.959
And note out that spirit reduced the friction amongst those who were traveling with Paul in preaching in the first century.

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:31.360
Now, the second description of Luke is found in Philemon, verse 24.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.759
And there, Luke is described as a fellow worker.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.160
Open with me the book of Acts, Acts chapter 16.

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:49.519
And we'll read beginning in verse 8, Acts chapter 16 and verse 8.

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:55.920
It says, so they, this is Paul, Timothy, Silas, and his traveling companions,

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:59.120
they passed by Misia and came down to Troas.

00:04:59.519 --> 00:05:03.519
And that's where Paul had the vision and he was told to step over into Macedonia.

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:05.319
And look at verse 10.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.519
As soon as he, that's Paul had seen the vision, we tried to go into Macedonia.

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:16.519
Verse 11 says, so we put out to see from Troas.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.620
Here's our introduction to the book of Luke.

00:05:20.519 --> 00:05:23.720
Luke never praises himself. He never writes about himself.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:30.720
We only trace Luke's travels with Paul by the change of a pronoun from they to we.

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:36.120
Now, this was in the second missionary tour that Paul, Luke joined.

00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:39.519
Paul here at Troas and he traveled on to Philippi with him.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.519
And look at what make Luke a fellow worker. Look at what we can learn from him.

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:48.420
This is in verse 13 when they arrived in Philippi.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:57.019
Verse 13 says, on the Sabbath day, we went outside the gate beside a river where we thought there was a place of prayer.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.420
And we sat down and began speaking to the woman, women who had assembled.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:09.420
And this now is the account of Lydia, where Lydia embraces the truth, the kingdom message.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:15.019
But did you notice? It said, we went outside. Luke went with them.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:19.019
It said, we thought there was a place of prayer.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.720
Luke was involved in the thinking process, in the discussion, in the decision about where to go.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.720
And Luke was involved in speaking to them.

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:33.819
Luke was a participant, not simply along for the ride, not a fellow traveler, not just a chronicler.

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.220
Luke was a fellow worker.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.620
And there's a beautiful lesson for us and for you.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.620
Be a participant.

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:48.620
Be an example. Get involved in the assignments you are given.

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:54.470
Now, it may be that Luke stayed in Philippi from 50 to 56.

00:06:54.670 --> 00:07:02.670
We don't know, but perhaps he did, because he joined Paul again in 56 CE on the third missionary to a from Philippi.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.870
What did he do in Philippi? We don't really know.

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:08.870
Typically, it's quiet about Luke.

00:07:09.069 --> 00:07:13.670
But we can assume he must have just been a busy fellow worker there in Philippi.

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:17.670
No sparks flying, just a busy fellow worker.

00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:24.269
He joined Paul again from 56, from Philippi. He traveled with him to Jerusalem.

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.069
He was in Jerusalem for the trouble in the temple.

00:07:27.269 --> 00:07:30.470
He traveled with in Cessaria, where Paul was a prisoner.

00:07:31.069 --> 00:07:35.069
And continued on with Paul to Rome, where Paul was a prisoner.

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:40.269
Luke, however, was not a prisoner, but he accompanied Paul.

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:46.269
How comforting that must have been for Paul to have his fellow worker with him.

00:07:47.269 --> 00:07:53.069
When you think about Paul, his countless beatings, the scourging, the stoning, the shipwrecks,

00:07:53.269 --> 00:07:58.870
they must have all taken a toll on him physically, not to mention the thorn and the flesh he had to deal with.

00:07:59.069 --> 00:08:03.069
One of his traveling companions was Timothy with frequent cases of sickness.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:08.269
How relieved they must have been to have Luke the physician with them.

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:15.269
So Luke is an example of long continued devotion to the kingdom work

00:08:16.069 --> 00:08:19.870
and of unshaken constancy to Paul and his associates.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:25.670
And in fact, this warm feeling of a fellow worker, Luke being a fellow worker,

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:29.870
is perhaps the best summed up in the final mention of Luke.

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:32.269
And that's in second Timothy 4, verse 11.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.870
Among Paul's final words, he says,

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:40.470
Luke alone is with me of all his fellow workers.

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:45.269
Perhaps there were none dearer or few dearer than Luke.

00:08:46.669 --> 00:08:50.870
You see, Luke's writing contained the least possible mention of himself.

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:56.470
Yet we do not doubt that he was eminently useful to Paul and to all those around him

00:08:56.669 --> 00:09:01.669
to be sure he enabled Paul to do much more than would have otherwise been possible for him.

00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:04.870
He kept himself out of sight.

00:09:05.669 --> 00:09:08.870
In his gospel, it is Christ that shines.

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:12.470
In the book of Acts, it's the kingdom preaching work that shines.

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:18.870
And I wonder if the silence in the scriptures in direct reference to Luke's intentional.

00:09:19.769 --> 00:09:21.669
It certainly teaches us something.

00:09:22.669 --> 00:09:26.669
Few other so prominent servants have so little mention

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:31.070
and therein lies the lesson from the life of Luke.

00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:41.669
Be an example of a servant who with lowlyness of mind finds your service in serving others.

00:09:42.669 --> 00:09:46.870
There was already one Paul, Luke stays in the background.

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:53.070
With the spirit of a true servant, he did not need the light of publicity to stimulate him.

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:55.370
He was not the machine.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.370
He was the oil.

00:09:58.769 --> 00:10:04.269
Finally, if the only three words used to describe you

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:10.269
are beloved fellow worker, your training here at Gilead will have been a success.

00:10:11.169 --> 00:10:15.169
And you, like Luke, will be oiled to machinery.
