WEBVTT

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.460
Excuse me. Larry?

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.460
We had such a good time this morning.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.460
Always enjoy working with you in service.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.460
Same here. And I hope Ms. Johnson comes to the meeting this Sunday.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.460
That would be so nice.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.460
Hey, did you ever find your sunglasses?

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.460
No. I looked all over. I have no idea where they could be.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.460
Hey, Denise.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.460
Hey, Susan.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.460
Good to see you.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.460
Good to see you.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.460
You left these at my house last night.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.460
Wow. Can you believe it?

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.460
What?

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.460
Susan had another gathering at her home last night.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.460
And I wasn't invited again.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.460
I just don't get it.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.460
I really had to be yours.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.460
Thanks again.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.460
I'm always living my stuff behind.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.460
And Helen, how are you doing?

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.460
I'm fine.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.460
Sorry. I got it.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.460
Helen?

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.460
What just happened?

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.460
I have no idea.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:18.489
Got a second?

00:01:18.489 --> 00:01:20.489
What do you want, Susan?

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:21.489
Helen.

00:01:21.489 --> 00:01:24.489
I feel like I must have done something or hurt you.

00:01:24.489 --> 00:01:27.489
And I want to apologize if I have.

00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:29.489
Is there something wrong?

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:32.489
I guess you had some more of the friends over last night?

00:01:32.489 --> 00:01:35.489
Well, yes, a few.

00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:40.489
Do you mind telling me why I'm never invited?

00:01:40.489 --> 00:01:43.489
Helen, I'm sorry. I never thought...

00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:45.489
Never thought what?

00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:49.489
That I would have noticed how many times you've done this to me.

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:54.489
Well, I've noticed yesterday makes the third time in the last couple of months

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:57.489
that you've had people to your home without me.

00:01:57.489 --> 00:02:01.489
Not to mention the four other times earlier this year.

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:03.489
I'm so sorry, Helen.

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:05.489
I didn't mean to cite you in any way.

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:08.490
And I promise it was nothing personal.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.490
Nothing personal.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.490
How can you invite everybody in the congregation

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.490
over to your home for a good time?

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.490
Accept to me and say that it's nothing personal.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.199
Good evening, brothers and sisters.

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:26.199
We invite you to please find your seats.

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:28.199
Our meeting is about to begin.

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:51.129
We had such a good time this morning.

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.129
Always enjoy working with you in service.

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:54.129
Same here.

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.129
And I hope Ms. Johnson comes to the meeting this Sunday.

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:58.129
That would be so nice.

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:59.129
Hey, did you ever find your sunglasses?

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.129
No, I looked all over.

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:03.129
I have no idea what it could be.

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:05.129
Hey, Susan.

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:06.129
Good to see you.

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:07.129
Good to see you.

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:09.129
You left things at my house last night.

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.129
Can you believe it?

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:12.129
I should have known.

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:13.129
Thank you so much, Susan.

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:14.129
Where were they?

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:15.129
Wow.

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:18.129
Susan had another gathering at her home.

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:22.129
I wonder why I wasn't invited again.

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:24.129
Wait, that's not important.

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:26.129
She's so hospitable.

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:29.129
I'm going to pray that Jehovah continues

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:30.129
to bless her for it.

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:33.129
And maybe there's something I can do.

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.129
And Helen, how are you doing?

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:36.129
Fine. How are you, Susan?

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:37.129
Great.

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:40.129
Hey, would you end you two now, Alice?

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:43.129
Would you like to work together in service this Saturday?

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:45.129
And then come to my house for lunch?

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:46.129
That sounds so nice.

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:47.129
Would I like to?

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:49.129
I would love to.

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:50.129
Thank you, Helen.

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:51.129
What can I bring?

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:53.129
Both of you, just bring yourselves.

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:54.129
I'll have everything ready.

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:56.129
Oh, it sounds good.
