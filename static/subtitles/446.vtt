00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:07.200
We would like to begin posing three questions and then answer those three questions first

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.599
What do we know about the resurrection?

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:14.720
Second, what don't we know about the resurrection?

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.399
And third, what should we do with what we know about the resurrection?

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:28.480
Well first, let's go to that first question posed. What do we know about the resurrection that will soon take place here on earth?

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:34.159
Well first of all, we know it's a guarantee. It's a promise that will be fulfilled.

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:47.359
And based on today's text at Acts 24 and verse 15, it says, there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous as well as the unrighteous.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.600
And just imagine what it will be like when that begins, when over 6,000 years of deaths are undone.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.240
And those who were sleeping in the graves will come back to life.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:08.400
What an amazing prospect. And as was pointed out, the first line in our Watchtower comments was pretty awesome.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.719
And I'm sure you saw that too, that Jehovah wants people to live, not die.

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:23.280
So this is really a manifestation of Jehovah's power as well as his unfailing love for all mankind.

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:30.400
And Jesus reflected his father's love. In fact, he died in our behalf.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.599
And he wanted to fulfill the promise he made at John, chapter 5, verses 28 and 29,

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:45.200
where he said, all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out.

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:53.680
All meaning all the righteous and the unrighteous. Those who are asleep will awaken.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.480
They may have been long forgotten by humans, but Jehovah has never forgotten them.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:09.680
They are right in his memory. Now, have you ever gone to an old cemetery and looked at some of the grave stones?

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:14.719
Some of the engraving has been worn off over years of weathering.

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:22.719
We don't even know who's buried in that burial plot. But Jehovah does, and he has it filed away

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:28.639
in his everlasting memory. So when we're talking about the righteous, that will come back.

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:34.800
Who are we talking about? Well, the righteous are the faithful men and women that have died before

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.439
Jesus' sacrificial death. And the other sheep who die during the last days.

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:49.599
And what about the unrighteous? Well, the unrighteous are humans, billions of humans who died

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.879
without really having an opportunity to know Jehovah, to get to worship him, or even apply

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:04.319
Bible truths. They will have the opportunity to get to know Jehovah, to draw close to him,

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:14.319
and to do his will. The March 2016 meeting workbook, you may recall this, had this scenario.

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:20.960
It said, instead of funerals, there may be welcoming sessions for the resurrected.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.840
Wow, that's going to be so amazing for us to actually be there and experience these welcoming

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:32.960
type of meetings. And it posed two questions in that meeting workbook.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.919
Which of your friends and relatives do you especially look forward to seeing again?

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:43.360
Now, there's probably some people going through your mind right now, like I am thinking about.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.039
The second question, which Bible characters do you especially want to meet and talk to?

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:54.080
Again, a whole list is probably coming to our minds. Well, stay tuned.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:01.919
Well, here's the question, what indication do we have as to the manner in which the resurrected ones

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.879
will take place? How will they come back? Well, based on 1 Corinthians 15 and verse 23,

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:16.319
we know that the heavenly resurrection of the anointed is done in an orderly way. As Paul said,

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:24.959
each one in his own proper order, Christ, the first fruits, afterward those who belong to the

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:31.040
Christ during his presence. So it would be progressive during that time. Now, since we know

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.959
Jehovah is a God of order, it's reasonable to conclude that the earthly resurrection will take

00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:45.279
place in a logical and orderly way. Instead of having billions come back to life all at once,

00:04:46.079 --> 00:04:51.439
we know that it would make much more sense that it would be done progressively so that as each one

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:57.279
is resurrected, they come to life, we can help them individually to their needs and their

00:04:57.279 --> 00:05:03.839
circumstances. Well, what do we know about the physical and spiritual care resurrected ones

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:12.319
will receive at that time? Well, at the right time, at Jehovah's perfect timing, he will awaken them

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:19.120
and what will they find? They will find abundant housing, clothing, and food, all given to them

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:27.279
by whom? By those who will make it through this system and on into the next. Great tribulation

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:36.560
survivors, you and me. And we have a president to that. Remember when Jesus resurrected a little girl

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:42.560
and all those who saw that amazing miracle? What did he say to those who saw that? He said,

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:49.120
please, give the little girl something to eat. So he didn't say that at every time he resurrected

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:56.639
someone, but he knew her individual needs and he addressed those. And likewise, we will have that

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:03.600
privilege in this coming system. Most of us will have that privilege and think about all the training

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:09.920
that we have received here at Bethel and LDC and other areas of our organization that will be put

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:17.279
to use at that time. And think about the billions of the unrighteous ones that will be resurrected

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:22.800
that need to have spiritual instruction. They need to learn about Jehovah. They need to learn

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:29.040
about Jesus and the ransom sacrifice and how they can exercise that faith in the ransom.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:37.759
Who will teach them? You will teach them. And hopefully I will teach them. And what will we use

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:45.360
as a basis to teach these ones who need to learn about Jehovah, Jesus and Jehovah's requirements?

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:52.319
Well, of course, the Bible will be something that we will use. But John's vision at Revelation 20 and

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:59.120
verse 12 gives us another clue. Now, let's turn there and read this together. Revelation 20 and

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:08.639
verse 12. It says, and I saw the dead, the great and the small standing before the throne, and

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:15.920
scrolls were opened. But another scroll was open. It is the scroll of life. The dead were judged out

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:24.079
of those things written in the scrolls, according to their deeds. Now, was this mentioning the

00:07:24.079 --> 00:07:33.120
deeds of their past conduct or past deeds? No. This judgment will not focus on what they did before

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:41.920
they died. But how do we know that? Romans 6 and verse 7. As you recall, it says, for the one who

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:50.879
has died has been acquitted, or the footnote says, released or pardoned from his sin. So those who

00:07:50.879 --> 00:07:58.079
come back to life, those who are resurrected will have a clean slate. What a relief for them

00:07:58.079 --> 00:08:05.600
and for us because many of us do know many who did not worship Jehovah before they passed away.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:12.800
So that clean slate is such a relief. So to live forever, there will be further

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:18.639
requirements for those who survive the great tribulation as well as those who are resurrected.

00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:24.480
We need to learn and continue to obey those requirements and any new ones that might be

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:31.920
revealed by Jehovah during the thousand years. Well, what don't we know about the resurrection?

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:41.519
A lot. There's so many questions that we might have. Who will those who died recently be raised

00:08:41.519 --> 00:08:46.720
near the start of Christ's thousand-year reign? Will the righteous be brought back first,

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:53.519
and then the unrighteous? Will they be welcomed by loved ones who know them? Will resurrection

00:08:53.519 --> 00:08:59.759
take place in the area where people died? How will Jehovah range matters for those who were married

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:05.759
when they died? Will faithful men of old with leadership abilities come back to help to organize

00:09:05.759 --> 00:09:12.399
matters? Well, how will theocratic spiritual food be given? Will there be a teaching committee,

00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:18.639
a writing committee, or will another arrangement be made to provide spiritual food? Will there be

00:09:18.639 --> 00:09:23.360
hard copies? Will there be electronic copies? Will there be videos? Will there be some sort of a JW

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:31.039
broadcast? We just don't know. We need to stay tuned and we need to be patient. It's good to

00:09:31.039 --> 00:09:38.159
heed Jeremiah's advice. If you turn to Lamentations, chapter three. Notice there in Lamentations,

00:09:38.159 --> 00:09:44.559
chapter three, verses 25 and 26, something that we want to focus in today in the meantime.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:51.679
It says, good is Jehovah to the one hoping in him, to the person who keeps seeking him.

00:09:52.559 --> 00:10:00.080
Good it is to wait in silence, or the footnote says, to wait patiently for the salvation of

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:08.159
Jehovah. So we know that in due course, all will be revealed by Jehovah. And as we rest our hope

00:10:08.159 --> 00:10:13.279
on Jehovah and those in the future when they come back, they know that the one who will satisfy

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:19.120
the desire of every living thing will have all taken care of for us. All the answers will be given

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:25.840
to us. Jehovah has always given us what we need to be faithful now and he'll do the same in the

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:32.159
future. And now it's up to each and every one of us to prove our faithfulness, to put our hope

00:10:32.879 --> 00:10:38.320
in that resurrection hope and share it with others. And hopefully someday, maybe a thousand years

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:46.480
from now, we'll look back and we'll say there was a resurrection of both the righteous and the

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.480
unrighteous.
