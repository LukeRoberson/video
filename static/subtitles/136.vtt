WEBVTT

00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:08.539
The governing body has also asked me to address another topic that I must say hits close

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:12.939
to my heart, being a father who raised two boys.

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:19.460
The subject is the abuse of children and the damaging effects this can have on such innocent

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.260
victims.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:28.100
As an organization, we view all such abuse of children whether physical, sexual, or emotional

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.300
as deplorable.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.899
As you likely know, Jehovah's Witnesses take a stronger position than most on the scriptural

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.100
and appropriateness of any form of immorality.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:49.500
However, to take advantage of innocent young ones is absolutely despicable.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:57.060
As a religious organization, we have taken a decisive stand against such behavior.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:03.140
It is our fervent desire to protect children from any kind of abuse.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:10.019
Our policy, as an organization, is that one professing to be a victim or his parents should

00:01:10.019 --> 00:01:16.939
never be discouraged from reporting the incident to the appropriate authorities.

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:23.140
While child abuse has been perpetrated earth-wide in many cultures for thousands of years, it

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.819
is only in the past 40 years or so that the magnitude and the extent of the problem has

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:31.459
become better known.

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:37.140
This is because governmental agencies are now determined to take a more active interest

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.299
in this problem.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.340
Laws were enacted requiring medical and other professionals to report cases to the authorities

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.859
when they became aware of them.

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:54.099
Try to that time, many governmental, educational and religious organizations were somewhat naive

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:59.659
about the magnitude and the complexity of the situation.

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.140
Others knew of the problem and covered it up.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.099
What has our position been as an organization?

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:14.460
When what was termed as the new morality became popular over 50 years ago, which included

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:21.020
sexual relations among young ones, we condemned such behavior based on the Bible's unhearing

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.139
and timeless principles.

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:29.780
As the awareness of child abuse became more and more known, we published a landmark of

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.300
Wake magazine over 30 years ago.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.740
It was the issue of June 22, 1982.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:44.419
There are five article titles that nailed the subject in a very straightforward manner.

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:54.060
The first article wasn't titled The New Morality, and then Chickens and Hawks was the second article.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.979
It warned about homosexual men who prey on and advocate the right to use boys for sex.

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:03.180
Shame on them.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.860
The next article, Baby Pros and Kitty porn,

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.860
condemned prostitute rings that employed small girls in an array of abuse.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.219
Then rape at home, no further explanation needed on that.

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:26.099
And finally, the article to end child abuse.

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:33.580
I remembered this magazine well since I had two boys who were in elementary school at the time.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.539
And again, remember that the world in general was still somewhat naive about the magnitude

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:42.500
of this issue and the gravity of the problem.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:49.259
I read the five articles, then I looked at my two boys and I said a prayer to your whole

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:56.259
of them, thanking him for moving the organization to be so proactive in trying to help parents

00:03:56.259 --> 00:04:03.379
to protect their young ones from the plague of the new morality in the abuse of children.

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:12.069
This issue has been straightforwardly addressed in print many times since then.

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:15.270
I now like you to view a PSA.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.029
What is a PSA?

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:21.069
It stands for public service announcement.

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:26.230
It is a message of public interest, which is aired by the media without charge.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.670
The objective is to raise awareness about changing public attitudes and behavior towards

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.110
a social issue.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.990
And stations are not obligated to play all such 30 to 60 second messages provided.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:45.350
However, if the topic and production value captures their attention, they can choose

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.829
to air a PSA for the benefit of the viewing audience.

00:04:50.829 --> 00:04:57.910
In the late 1990s, the governing body approved four PSAs on the subject of family life.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:03.350
I'd like to show you one of these that was produced back in 2002.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.949
It was picked up and aired by some of the largest TV networks in the United States.

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:09.550
Why?

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.910
Because they realized this type of warning was important for their viewing audience to

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:14.910
see.

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.149
It is true.

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:23.509
The type of computer equipment shown in the video dates it, however, the message is just

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:30.230
as pertinent now as then, and maybe even more so, please watch.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:37.230
He understands you, and makes you feel special.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:44.139
He knows everything you're interested in.

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:59.899
He's your best friend, and always there when you need him.

00:05:59.899 --> 00:06:07.240
He seems too good to be true.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:20.860
He is, parents, protect your children, and most of all, give your children knowledge,

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.779
wisdom, and thinking ability.

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:29.899
Love builds happy families.

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:35.379
While we cannot control everything that an individual might say, it is clear that over

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:42.139
the decades, protecting children from abuse is a top priority for this organization.

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:46.180
We are proud of our reputation in this regard.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:51.300
And we look forward to the time in God's new world when no one, young or old, will

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.300
ever again be a victim of abuse.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.660
Since the latter part of our discussion has addressed what Jehovah's organization has

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:05.540
done to protect children from predators, it gives me great pleasure to release it this

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:10.500
time another animated video in the series, Become Jehovah's Friend.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:20.029
It is entitled, Protect Your Children.

00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:23.829
Children, Jehovah wants you to be happy and keep you safe.

00:07:23.829 --> 00:07:27.629
But some people want to do bad things to you.

00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:30.949
So Jehovah gave you a conscience.

00:07:30.949 --> 00:07:35.509
It's like an alarm system that helps you to know right from wrong.

00:07:35.509 --> 00:07:37.430
It will protect you from danger.

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:41.110
So Mum and I will help you test your alarm system.

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:42.589
Ready?

00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:47.189
What if someone tells you something that makes you feel uncomfortable or scares you?

00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:48.189
What do you do?

00:07:48.189 --> 00:07:50.589
I'm not sure, but that's weird.

00:07:50.589 --> 00:07:51.589
Stop.

00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:52.589
Very good.

00:07:52.589 --> 00:07:57.069
Tell them to stop it and you tell Mum and Daddy.

00:07:57.069 --> 00:08:02.550
No matter what someone tells you, never keep a secret from us.

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:06.709
What if they ask you to do something that makes you feel uncomfortable?

00:08:06.709 --> 00:08:10.230
I would say no.

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:11.230
You're right.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:14.990
You should say no and walk away.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.910
What if they try to touch you where they shouldn't?

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:19.149
I wouldn't let them.

00:08:19.149 --> 00:08:20.790
I'd get out of there.

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:27.470
And Caleb, even if it's an adult you know and trust, you should say no and run away.

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:29.189
And you should yell, stop doing that.

00:08:29.189 --> 00:08:30.709
I'm going to tell on you.

00:08:30.709 --> 00:08:31.709
Stop doing that.

00:08:31.709 --> 00:08:34.230
I'm going to tell on you.

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:39.190
The world can be a scary place, but you are never alone.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:55.899
Remember, you have your conscience, your mum and dad who love you, and you have Jehovah.

00:08:55.899 --> 00:09:01.980
We're happy to see how Jehovah's organization continues to teach our young ones how to make

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:08.980
wise choices when the figure of monsters of this world try to lure them into their traps.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:14.179
And you parents should be commended for your tireless efforts to protect your children.
