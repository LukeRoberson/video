00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:09.789
Every six months, the Watchtower Bible School of Gillian holds a graduation ceremony at the

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:13.470
Educational Center in Patterson, New York.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:20.309
The attendance at this spiritually upbuilding program was 9,694.

00:00:20.309 --> 00:00:26.469
Guests from 59 countries were among those present for this special occasion.

00:00:26.469 --> 00:00:31.789
As chairman of the program, I shared remarks encouraging all to consider things that

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.630
are lovable based on Philippians chapter 4, verse 8.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:44.070
Next, a talk entitled acquire knowledge but do not become excessively wise, was delivered

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.350
by Harold Corcoran, a member of the United States Branch Committee.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.590
But notice what Jehovah says to us at Proverbs 12, 23.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:00.950
A shrewd man, a wise man, is covering knowledge, but the heart of the stupid ones is the one

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.229
that cause outpolicious.

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.069
Now on one hand, he's given you all this knowledge and you're ready to share it, then

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:09.590
he says, cover it.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:10.790
In what respect?

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:18.549
Well, it doesn't mean that you would hide it all the time, but you would exercise restraint.

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.709
You would be discreet in the display of the knowledge and understanding that you have

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:23.709
gained.

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:29.950
Guy Pearce, a member of the governing body, developed the subject, do not forget the practices

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:30.950
of God.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.909
Your conduct will be influenced for good as you go to your various assignments after

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.510
the school.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.950
If you put into practice all the things you've learned as best you can here.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.390
This has to do with our manners, how we treat others, how we view them as superior

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.909
to us.

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:54.909
Examples in love, obviously it's important to love your brothers and to demonstrate that

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.909
love by how you deal with them, how you treat them, how you build them up and encourage

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:00.909
them.

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:07.349
In examples in faith, this should be seen in your conviction, should be seen in the way

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:16.509
you give talks, the way you lead your life, your personal study, your ministry.

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:20.949
What we have done is what we ought to have done, was the theme of a talk delivered by the

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:25.349
overseer of the Theocratic schools department, William Samuelson.

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:32.710
A faithful slave would not put off serving the master to tend to his own comforts, to

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.550
his own interests, Moses, Jonah, Barrick.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.270
Undoubtedly they had reasons for their reluctance in accepting the assignment.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.030
But in the final analysis, they did what they ought to do.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.110
Samuelson, assistant overseer of the Theocratic schools department, encouraged the students

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.270
with the subject, remembered Jehovah's assurance when facing challenges.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:06.389
In verse 5, Paul quotes Deuteronomy 31 and verse 8, and also Joshua 1.5, and he makes

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:11.469
this statement, let your manner of life be free from the love of money while you're content

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:16.990
with the present things, for he has said, and here's the quote, brings it right out of

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:25.629
the Hebrew scriptures, I will by no means leave you, nor by any means forsake you.

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:32.830
That expression by no means is the strongest expression you can possibly make in the Greek

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.349
language.

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.949
Gilead training also includes time spent in the field ministry with local congregations

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:41.030
of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.949
Under the theme, and all the earth, their sound went out, the students related to Mark

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:51.789
Numer, one of the school's instructors, several exciting field service experiences,

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:55.310
re-enacting some of them.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.669
Next on the program was Gene Smalley, a helper to the writing committee, who interviewed

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:01.789
two graduating couples.

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:06.669
They sincerely expressed how their Gilead training would be of value to them as they serve

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:10.580
in their missionary assignments.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:16.259
To round out the fine spiritual program, Garrett Lush, a member of the governing body, spoke

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:20.620
to the students on the theme, endure to the end, and beyond.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:29.019
Brother Frederick France said once, it's part of a quote, our hope is a sure thing.

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:35.980
It is something worth waiting for, even if it required a million years.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:45.139
So let us keep eternity in mind and keep enduring until Armageddon and beyond, because, according

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:51.459
to Hebrews 1039, we are not the sort that shriek back, but we are the sort that have

00:04:51.459 --> 00:04:58.410
faith for the preserving a life of the soul.

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:14.420
I read warm greetings from friends around the world.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.420
Then, after the students received their diplomas, one of the students read a touching letter

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:28.600
from the graduating class, expressing heartfelt appreciation for the school.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.519
All in attendance, rejoiced with the graduates on their special day.
