00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:30.800
This wasn't the first health scare with Mum, and my brother and sister were always quick

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.800
to help out.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:01:01.530
But this time was different.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:11.829
She'd be here for at least another week, then more long-term care.

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:24.159
We just weren't prepared for that.

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.040
I should have accepted more help when the friends offered.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.500
I just didn't want to be a burden.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:39.170
Janice understood and she was wondering how this might affect her Bethel service.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.209
Parents wished he'd live closer so he could do more.

00:01:44.209 --> 00:02:21.330
We decided to pray, sleep on it, and regroup after doing some research.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:33.620
I shared the example of Joseph at Genesis 45, where he told his father,

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.659
you must dwell in the land of Goshen, where you will be near me.

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:43.830
I will supply you with food.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:53.400
He didn't let a long distance get in his way of caring for Jacob.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:06.330
He took practical steps, and made his care a priority.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:14.210
Janice and Terence found great articles too, offering solutions such as asking for periodic

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:49.099
help, making more time to communicate with Mum, or even getting a part-time nurse.

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:57.289
We weren't prepared for her situation to change so suddenly, but Jehovah is guiding us

00:03:57.289 --> 00:04:07.099
through each new challenge.

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:25.170
And with his help, we're honoring Mum, making her care our continual priority.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:31.089
In this dramatization, we saw one way that the family decided to care for an aging parent.

00:04:31.089 --> 00:04:35.490
Of course, situations will differ from one family to the next.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.290
Each must make a prayerful decision based on their circumstances.
