00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.219
an introduction to the book of Ezra.

00:00:05.219 --> 00:00:11.220
The book was written by Ezra, a priest from the family line of Aaron.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.219
Ezra was a man of faith who made a diligent study of the scriptures,

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.219
and as a priest, had the responsibility to teach God's word to others.

00:00:21.219 --> 00:00:29.469
He was also a skilled copyist, a job that required meticulous attention to detail.

00:00:29.469 --> 00:00:35.469
This thoroughly researched account picks up right where he concluded the book of Second Chronicles,

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:38.469
following the Jewish captivity in Babylon.

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:45.039
He wrote this book in about 460 BCE in Jerusalem.

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:50.039
Did you know The books of Ezra and Nehemiah were combined on one scroll.

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.039
Later though, the scroll was divided into the two books we have in our Bibles today.

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.609
The book of Ezra contains ten chapters.

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:07.609
Chapters 1 through 6 describe the return of a small group of Jews to Jerusalem.

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:13.609
In 537 BCE, they rebuilt the altar and celebrated the festival of booze,

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:18.890
thus ending the 70-year desolation.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.890
In the following year, the foundation of the temple was laid.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.890
And although opposition halted the work for a time,

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.890
the house of Jehovah was completed by 515 BCE.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:40.780
In chapters 7 to 10, we jumped forward almost 50 years to 468 BCE

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.780
as Ezra recounts his own perilous journey to Jerusalem.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:53.780
Upon arrival, Ezra was shocked to find that serious sins have taken place among the Jews.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.780
He approached Jehovah in public prayer, and action was taken to restore the spiritual condition of the people.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:11.090
As you read the book of Ezra, take note of how Jehovah fulfilled his promise to free his people from exile in Babylon,

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.090
and to restore true worship in Jerusalem.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.090
Important steps leading to the appearance of the Messiah.
