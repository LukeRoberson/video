00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:15.519
Since ancient times, humans have wanted to feel close to God.

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.519
This is a noble desire.

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.519
The Bible says that if we seek God,

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:26.519
we can really find Him and draw close to Him.

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.519
Yet God is invisible.

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.520
So how can we feel close to a God whom we cannot see?

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.520
Would it help if we venerated physical objects

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.520
as a means to feel closer to God?

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.520
Some people use statues in their worship.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.520
Others venerate icons and other religious images

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.520
as part of their worship.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.520
But is it possible that those who try to get closer to God in this way

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.520
are actually drawing farther away from Him?

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.409
Consider what the Bible says happened when the ancient Israelites

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.409
made a statue of a calf and tried to use it to worship God.

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.409
And they called it a festival to Jehovah, the God of the Bible.

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.409
Did God accept this kind of worship?

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.409
No. He said that He was not pleased with what they had done.

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.409
Just think, instead of helping them to get closer to God,

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.409
this object actually pushed them away.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.090
In fact, contrary to ancient rulers

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.090
who were often viewed as gods and had images of themselves made,

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.090
the great king overall, Jehovah God,

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.090
told his people not to create or use images for worship.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.090
He said, you must not make for yourself a carved image.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.090
You must not bow down to them.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.090
I am a God who requires exclusive devotion.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.090
Centuries later, the same command applied to Jesus' followers.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.090
The Apostle John wrote to early Christians saying,

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:26.620
guard yourselves from idols.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.620
God explains why His worship should always be free of images.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:42.159
I give my glory to no one else, nor my praise to graven images.

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:46.159
He invites people to draw close to Him personally

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:50.159
and to pray to Him directly without the use of images.

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:59.020
Is it really wrong to use images, idols, or icons merely as aides in our worship?

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.020
How can we feel close to God if we cannot see Him?
