00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:07.480
I thought for a few minutes this morning, we could consider two verses that highlight the

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:15.560
importance of being merciful in our actions, and also highlight the blessings that result

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.800
when we are merciful.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.039
The first verse is in Matthew chapter 5, verse 7.

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.109
So I invite you to turn there.

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:33.429
Matthew chapter 5, verse 7, and here in the sermon on the mount and the happiness that

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:41.950
introduced this sermon, Jesus said, Happy are the merciful, why?

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.000
Since they will be shown mercy.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.840
How is it that the merciful are shown mercy?

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:00.280
A striking example can be found in Acts chapter 9, where we are introduced to a first

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.799
century disciple named Tabitha or Dorcas.

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:12.239
She lived in the port city of Japa, and what reputation did Tabitha have?

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:22.640
Well she is described in the Bible as one who abounded in good deeds and gifts of mercy.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.280
How did Tabitha give gifts of mercy?

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:35.040
She was a seamstress, and she used her skill to address a need.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:44.599
She made garments for needy widows, and they appreciated her gifts of mercy very much,

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:52.439
so that when Tabitha fell ill and died, the widows were grief-stricken.

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.079
The disciples in Japa, when they learned that the Apostle Peter was just 11 miles away

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:05.359
in Lidha, sent and asked him to come without delay to Japa.

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:12.280
Peter accepted the invitation, and what did he find in Japa when he got there?

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:20.280
Grieving widows, who bore eloquent testimony to the gifts of mercy that Tabitha had given

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.360
them.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:30.080
Peter was so moved that with the help of Jehovah's Holy Spirit, he did something that

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.400
up until that time hadn't happened according to the Bible record.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.240
As an Apostle, he raised someone from the dead.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:46.319
He resurrected Tabitha, and that was a great mercy to her.

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:56.879
At the point, Tabitha gave gifts of mercy that elicited a merciful act in her behalf.

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:02.560
Happy are the merciful since they will be shown mercy.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.599
Tabitha did what she could.

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:09.759
She used her skill to fill a need.

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:16.639
A gift of mercy may appear to be large or small in the eyes of observers.

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:24.240
But when it's prompted by love and fills a genuine need, it is appreciated.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:33.039
And more importantly, Jehovah notices just as he noticed Tabitha's gifts of mercy.

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:38.639
The second verse that we want to consider is James chapter 2.

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:47.789
When they're with me, please, James chapter 2, and we're going to read verse 13.

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:56.949
For the one who does not practice mercy will have his judgment without mercy.

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:59.750
Mercy triumphs over judgment.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.229
Now, that's a thought-provoking statement.

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:09.509
How is it that mercy triumphs over judgment?

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:16.750
In the Bible, Jehovah frankly tells us that each of us will render an account for himself

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.629
or herself to God.

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:28.029
And when that time comes and Jehovah evaluates us as individuals, he takes into consideration

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:32.990
acts of mercy that we have performed for others.

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:38.870
Now the thought is not that we buy ourselves out of trouble.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:45.870
The point is that Jehovah sees the kind acts that we're prompted to do by our compassionate

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.110
heart, and he takes that into consideration.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.870
Now James frankly addresses the other side of the coin, doesn't he?

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:02.310
The one who does not practice mercy will have his judgment without mercy.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:09.990
A significant way that you and I can demonstrate mercy is by freely forgiving those who sin

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.350
against us.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.750
Is that always easy?

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.149
No.

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:22.790
Especially if we've been hurt or damaged, it may be very challenging to make the decision

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.870
to forgive.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:31.550
But how important is it that we demonstrate this kind of mercy?

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.430
All the answer to that question is found in another illustration that Jesus gave recorded

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.149
in Matthew chapter 18.

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:48.629
There Jesus talked about a slave who was indebted to his master for sixty million denariah.

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:50.670
It was an impossible debt.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:55.230
If the slave had lived a thousand lifetimes, he couldn't have repaid it.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:00.110
The master ordered the slave and his family and all that he had to be sold.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.670
The slave begged for mercy.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:11.509
The master was moved with pity and canceled the entire debt.

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:21.449
What a beautiful gift or act of mercy or what happened next.

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:28.769
The forgiven slave turned around and confronted a fellow slave who owed him one hundred denariah,

00:06:28.769 --> 00:06:33.170
just a tiny fraction of what he had been forgiven.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:38.769
But when his fellow slave couldn't repaid the debt, the forgiven slave had him thrown

00:06:38.769 --> 00:06:40.769
into prison.

00:06:40.769 --> 00:06:42.250
What an injustice.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.850
And when the master learned of it, he was provoked to wrath.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:55.850
He asked, should you also not have shown mercy to your fellow slave as I showed mercy to you?

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.329
What is the point of application?

00:06:58.329 --> 00:07:04.769
Jesus said, my heavenly Father will also deal with you in the same way if each of you

00:07:04.769 --> 00:07:10.329
does not forgive your brother from your heart.

00:07:10.329 --> 00:07:15.970
So the matter of forgiveness is just that important.

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:19.529
It's been said that forgiveness is like money.

00:07:19.529 --> 00:07:27.689
It can be spent freely and mercifully on others, or it can be hoarded stingially.

00:07:27.689 --> 00:07:33.970
We can't afford to be stingy with forgiveness.

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:41.050
Instead, it's better to experience the joy that comes from giving by letting go and

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:44.490
canceling the debt.

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:48.810
Consider the experience of a Christian elder named Miguel.

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:52.529
Miguel's grandson was murdered.

00:07:52.529 --> 00:07:57.050
The murderer was captured, tried, and imprisoned.

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:02.009
One time later, Miguel was invited to share in the prison ministry.

00:08:02.009 --> 00:08:05.170
Can you guess which prison?

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:06.529
That's right.

00:08:06.529 --> 00:08:13.410
He was asked to go to the very prison where his grandson's murderer was incarcerated.

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:16.050
At first, Miguel was hesitant.

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:22.610
He didn't know whether he should, but then he decided to accept the invitation.

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:28.569
And sure enough, while in the prison he was confronted by the man who murdered his

00:08:28.569 --> 00:08:30.410
grandson.

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:33.850
How would Miguel handle that situation?

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:40.450
With mildness and in a way that promoted peace, he invited the man to join him for the

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:43.090
Bible study.

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:47.649
To Miguel's surprise, the man accepted the invitation.

00:08:47.649 --> 00:08:52.730
And after the study, he confessed to Miguel something that he never admitted during

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:54.690
his trial.

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:58.809
He confessed to killing Miguel's grandson.

00:08:58.809 --> 00:09:03.370
And then he asked for forgiveness.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:05.809
What would Miguel do?

00:09:05.809 --> 00:09:12.529
Well as it turned out, he studied with the man, and the man progressed to the point of

00:09:12.529 --> 00:09:16.409
baptism and became one of our brothers.

00:09:16.409 --> 00:09:22.490
But a beautiful gift of mercy and forgiveness.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:25.929
And a fine example for all of us.

00:09:25.929 --> 00:09:28.929
So what if we learned?

00:09:28.929 --> 00:09:38.889
If we're merciful, we can be happy because we'll be shown mercy and mercy triumphs over judgment.

00:09:38.889 --> 00:09:46.370
If we remember those things, then we will gladly do as Jesus said, go and act mercifully.

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:47.769
Yourself.
