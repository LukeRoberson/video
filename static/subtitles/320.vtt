00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:12.740
But John, there's still plenty you can do in the congregation.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.739
Sure, that sounds good, but I'm no longer a ministerial servant.

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:23.739
Why did I let my zeal for the ministry cool off?

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:29.519
I know what the brothers must think of me now.

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.519
Hello?

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.520
Oh, good morning.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.520
My name's Jane, how are you?

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.520
Not bad, thanks.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.520
I know you may not be interested, but I have this track that I'd like to listen to.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.520
You may not be interested.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.520
Where did that come from?

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:54.520
Not my best presentation, but it didn't seem like she wanted to talk more anyway.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.520
Well, what does that mean?

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.520
It may be manageable, but long term, given your other conditions, you're looking at positive.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.519
Manageable, long term.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.519
Oh, Jehovah, how can I do this by myself?

00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:32.040
Of course, Jehovah values you.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.040
Try to think of someone in the Bible who may have felt like you do.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.040
Like Jonah.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.040
Jonah.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.040
Felt like I do.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:55.519
What comes to your mind when you think of Jonah?

00:01:55.519 --> 00:02:10.939
Do you think of him as a disobedient prophet?

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:20.939
Reluctant to obey Jehovah's command, Jonah ordered a ship that carried him farther and farther away from his assignment.

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:44.080
Did Jonah's recent actions disqualify him from ever again serving God in an official capacity?

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.080
He sure could have thought so.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.080
I know I do.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.699
No.

00:02:52.699 --> 00:03:12.810
Jehovah mercifully and lovingly renewed the prophet's commission.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:19.810
So if Jehovah didn't see Jonah as a total failure, then what must he think of me?

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:26.879
1 Samuel 16 verse 7.

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:31.879
For the way man sees is not the way God sees.

00:03:31.879 --> 00:04:04.180
Jonah did not see Nineveh as Jehovah did with all they were doing.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.810
How could he view them any differently?

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.810
But the account says when God saw they had turned back from their evil ways.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.699
He reconsidered the calamity and he did not bring it.

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:24.699
Despite the people's badness, Jehovah cared about them.

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:32.699
He values human life and the potential that each individual has for repenting and learning to do what is right.

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:37.329
Well of course that's true.

00:04:37.329 --> 00:04:42.180
Why didn't Jonah see that?

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.180
But am I seeing people the way Jehovah does?

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.129
Am I assuming they won't listen?

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:53.129
And then not giving my best?

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:58.879
How can I know how a personal respond?

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:01.879
Jonah learned to be merciful.

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:09.319
Will we?

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:12.319
Matthew 5 verse 7 says,

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:15.319
Happy are the merciful.

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:17.319
Since they will be shown mercy.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.360
Then Jonah prayed to Jehovah his God from the belly of the fish and he said,

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:34.360
Out of my distress I call that to Jehovah and he answered me.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:44.250
Out of the depths of the grave I cried for help.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.689
God heard Jonah and delivered him.

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:51.689
I can't expect a miracle.

00:05:51.689 --> 00:06:00.370
Then my prayer came into you, into your holy temple.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:08.629
My prayer came into you.

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:12.629
Jonah didn't know if Jehovah would rescue him.

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:15.629
But he prayed in faith that Jehovah cared.

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:23.879
But as for me, with the voice of thanksgiving I will sacrifice to you.

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:29.879
What I have vowed I will pay, salvation is from Jehovah.

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:39.699
As long as I still can,

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:42.699
I'll keep sacrificing to God.

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:49.569
Salvation is from Jehovah.
