00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.929
Before coming to Gilead, all of you students enjoyed many privileges of service.

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:15.250
Maybe you served as a regular pioneer, as a special pioneer, a construction worker, or

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.969
as a field missionary.

00:00:16.969 --> 00:00:20.570
You may have served in the circuit worker at Bethel.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.850
And now you've enjoyed the additional privilege of having five months of intensive training

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.250
here at Gilead School.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.770
And no doubt all of you have appreciated the fine direction you've received.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:43.329
Proverbs chapter 28 verse 20 says that a faithful man will receive many blessings.

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:50.770
And no doubt all of you students feel richly blessed here on your graduation day.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.689
We're very happy for you, and we're certainly confident that there are many more blessings

00:00:55.689 --> 00:01:00.929
and privileges that await you as you go on to your assignments.

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:05.969
But before you go, I'd just like to ask one question.

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:10.290
Do privileges make you privileged?

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.209
We ask this question because the answer will help you to have a proper view of your Gilead

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:22.090
training and also whatever privileges you may receive as you go on to your assignment.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:29.409
And the answer will also help all of us to show modesty and humility in whatever assignment

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.489
Jehovah C's fit to give us.

00:01:32.489 --> 00:01:36.530
So do privileges make us privileged?

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.609
The simple answer is no.

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:44.129
But in some languages, the word privilege can carry the wrong idea.

00:01:44.129 --> 00:01:50.489
For example, in English, privilege carries the meaning of entitlement.

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:55.609
We may speak of a privileged class, people who because of their birth or because of their

00:01:55.609 --> 00:02:01.409
wealth have a higher place in society than others.

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:08.210
A privilege that we receive in Jehovah's organization could even be misunderstood as something

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:14.490
given to us because we're special or even better than others.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:20.050
The possibility of misunderstanding, what is meant by the word privilege, is even more

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.169
pronounced in other languages.

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:31.530
For example, in Japanese for many years, we use the word token to translate the word privilege.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.330
And if you look in the dictionary, that's the word that you should use.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.050
But many of us in the Japanese field felt a little bit uncomfortable using token because

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:47.449
that word is formed by combining two Chinese characters.

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:53.729
Toku means special, Ken means right.

00:02:53.729 --> 00:03:00.210
So literally, that would mean you have a special right to attend Gilead School.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.770
I have a special right to serve at Bethel.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.009
But we know that is not the case.

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:11.930
So you can imagine our delight.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:18.889
When we received the study article number 35 in the September 2019 issue of the Watchtower,

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:22.569
it was entitled Jehovah values his humble servants.

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:29.449
And in a section that was discussing the need for humility, when others receive privileges

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:38.090
of service, the Japanese translators applied the principle of meaning-based translation.

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:44.370
Instead of using the dictionary meaning and calling the privileges special rights, they

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:51.090
call them Hoshino Kikai, opportunities to serve.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.689
We were elated.

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:59.889
Privileges are not given as a special right, rather they give us additional opportunities

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:04.650
to be of service to Jehovah and to our brothers.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.050
So does that mean we should stop using the word privilege?

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:14.889
Not necessarily, but we do need to have a correct understanding of its meaning in the

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:17.730
spiritual setting.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.769
One way to gain a proper understanding is to examine how the word privilege is used

00:04:22.769 --> 00:04:24.970
in the New World Translation.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:32.529
For example, at Luke chapter 1, verse 43, Elizabeth described a visit from Mary, the mother

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:36.290
of her Lord, as a privilege.

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:42.089
Now did Elizabeth mean that she had a special right to have Mary enter her home?

00:04:42.089 --> 00:04:43.490
No.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:50.009
Rather, she viewed the visit as a blessing from Jehovah.

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:56.689
Acts chapter 7, verse 46, speaks of David asking God for the privilege of providing a dwelling

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:59.329
place for the God of Jacob.

00:04:59.329 --> 00:05:05.209
And at 2 Corinthians chapter 8, verse 4, Paul spoke of Christians who kept earnestly

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:13.490
begging us for the privilege of having to share in the relief ministry for the holy ones.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:20.569
David and Paul were not talking about any special right, rather they were describing an opportunity

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:25.449
to work in service to Jehovah and to their brothers.

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:32.689
So let's not be misled by the meaning that the world generally attaches to the word privilege.

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:37.569
The direction found at Luke chapter 17, verse 10, will help us.

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:39.769
Please open to that verse.

00:05:39.769 --> 00:05:48.250
And whenever we receive a privilege or an opportunity to serve, let's remember these words

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.529
and this counsel of Jesus.

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:56.290
Luke chapter 17 and verse 10.

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:01.689
He said likewise, when you have done all the things assigned to you, say, we are good

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:03.730
for nothing slaves.

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:08.449
What we have done is what we ought to have done.

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:14.569
Now of course this doesn't mean that we should view ourselves as useless or worthless.

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:20.689
A note in the study Bible explains that according to the context, good for nothing conveys

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:28.410
the idea that the slave would view himself modestly, not as deserving of some special credit

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.769
or praise.

00:06:30.769 --> 00:06:37.610
And that is how we view ourselves when we receive privileges of service.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.649
Now let's consider another aspect of privileges.

00:06:40.649 --> 00:06:47.889
The English dictionary defines privilege as a right attached specifically to a position

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:49.529
or office.

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:58.970
However, not all privileges of service involve a specific assignment or position.

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:04.610
The number of positions in Jehovah's organization is limited.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:09.370
The opportunities to serve are endless.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.250
Please open to Matthew chapter 20.

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:20.250
We'll read verses 25 to 27 because here Jesus clarified the importance of serving over

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:21.250
position.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.129
Now brother, let already explain the setting.

00:07:24.129 --> 00:07:29.769
This is when the mother of James and John asked Jesus to give her son special positions

00:07:29.769 --> 00:07:31.569
in the kingdom.

00:07:31.569 --> 00:07:38.329
In verses 25 to 27, this is what Jesus said.

00:07:38.329 --> 00:07:44.089
But Jesus called them to him and said, you know that the rulers of the nations lorded

00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:47.810
over them and the great men wheeled authority over them.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.529
This must not be the way among you.

00:07:50.529 --> 00:07:54.889
And whoever wants to become great among you must be your minister.

00:07:54.889 --> 00:07:59.490
And whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave.

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:06.610
Yes, instead of seeking a high position of authority, Christians reach out to minister

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:12.170
to the needs of others to serve as humble slaves.

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:20.009
Interestingly, 1 Timothy chapter 3, verse 1, used to describe a man who is reaching out

00:08:20.009 --> 00:08:23.449
for an office of overseer.

00:08:23.449 --> 00:08:32.129
But the revised edition of the New World Translation reads, if a man is reaching out to be an overseer,

00:08:32.129 --> 00:08:34.850
he is desirous of a fine work.

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:41.009
This puts the emphasis not on the office or position, but on the qualifications that are

00:08:41.009 --> 00:08:46.850
needed by one who exerts himself to be of service to others.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:54.169
There are many opportunities of service that do not involve a special appointment or position.

00:08:54.169 --> 00:08:59.769
Think of Bible examples of hardworking Christian men and women.

00:08:59.769 --> 00:09:05.009
Dorcas abounded in good deeds and gifts of mercy.

00:09:05.009 --> 00:09:11.370
Joanna, Susanna, and many other women minister to Jesus from their belongings.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:17.409
And while Paul was in prison, Tichicus served as his personal messenger.

00:09:17.409 --> 00:09:22.210
Mark helped Paul in practical ways perhaps delivering food to him.

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:30.529
So as you go on to your assignment, remember, privileges do not make you privileged.

00:09:30.529 --> 00:09:35.649
And whether your privileges come with an official assignment or not, humbly carry them

00:09:35.649 --> 00:09:42.370
out as opportunities to slave for Jehovah and to serve our brothers more fully.
