00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:06.419
Are you okay?

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:07.419
I'm worried.

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:09.419
You need more money.

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:11.419
It's your hope it will take care of us.

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:13.419
He always has.

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:14.419
We have enough.

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:16.420
Maybe enough today.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.420
But what if you get sick?

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.420
Gloria's mother keeps badgering her meat to move up.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.420
I can get a job at my uncle's real estate firm.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.420
Maybe this is an answer to our prayers.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.420
What about your pioneering?

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.420
What about it?

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.420
I can do both.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.420
Gloria.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.420
I must congratulate you on your hard work with my company.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.420
But you must learn to keep your religion in its place.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.420
We're neglecting family worship, study, service.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.420
We've even become too busy or maybe too ashamed to even pray together.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.829
I'm concerned about you.

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.829
One of the things that you always talk to me about was Matthew 624.

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.829
You cannot slay for God and for riches.

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.829
You're not the same person that I once knew.

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:11.200
Dad, where's mom?

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.200
She is coming, right?

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:21.560
Is it really wrong to try and improve our life?

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.560
Mom, mom, mom.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.560
Remember the wife of God.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.560
Remember the wife of God.
