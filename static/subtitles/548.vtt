00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:03.370
Lovers of money.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:10.869
That didn't sound too bad, I mean, compared to betrayers, fears, slanders, and other traits

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:17.609
listed in 2 Timothy 3, what's so bad about being a lover of money?

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.690
A lot.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:26.050
Once a person loves money, more than anything or anyone else, it corrupts them.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:32.969
For example, let's consider what lovers of money have done and affect on big business.

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.969
Now business that produces a good product at a fair price, consumers, and others appreciate.

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.289
However, when a business is run by lovers of money, they cut corners.

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.210
They lie about risks.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.689
Accept or offer bribes are basically do anything they can to raise their stock price or increase

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:54.689
profits.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.530
We've all seen the constant upgrades, the completely false advertisements, and many

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:09.530
people today just accept that as so common and so normal that they say it's just business.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.890
How have lovers of money affected governments?

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.370
Well when lovers of money get into power, government for the people becomes government

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.370
for them.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.930
That money is diverted into private bank accounts that makes these politicians and government

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.689
leaders very wealthy.

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:36.370
The power that love of money has to corrupt even the most well-meaning men and women

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.329
in politics, we can see it in full effect around us.

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:42.569
It's an everyday occurrence.

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:48.090
No government on earth is immune to the effect that lovers of money have on government.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:54.530
In fact, the suffering of many people around the world can be traced back to greed and

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.530
lovers of money in government.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:04.329
Well, what effect have lovers of money had on Christendom and false religion?

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:10.409
Well once Christendoms, priests or ministers started to charge for their services or press

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:16.409
their congregations very hard for money, it had a corrupting influence on the worship

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.050
of God.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.889
Many changed how religion worked.

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:27.009
It changed the relationship of people, ministers to their congregation.

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:31.930
I mean, to illustrate for a moment, think of a wife that goes to her husband and hands

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.569
him a bill for all the work she's done in the family.

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.849
And the husband turns around and gives her a bill for all the work he does in the family.

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:47.569
You think that might change the relationship in the family about how they feel about one

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.090
another and the work they do, of course it would.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.250
Jehovah inspired Paul to see the corrupting influence that lovers of money would have

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:04.900
on religion in 2 Timothy chapter 4 and verses 3 and 4.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.900
2 Timothy chapter 4 verses 3 and 4.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.699
He says, for there will be a period of time when they will not put up with the wholesome

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:17.020
teaching, but according to their own desires, they will surround themselves with teachers

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.659
to have their ears tickled.

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:26.259
They will turn away from listening to the truth and give attention to false stories.

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:32.819
Well today, as mentioned in these verses, many religions are based on tickle their ears

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:39.259
messages, false stories, platitudes, and kind of feel good about yourself messages.

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:44.439
You know, when I searched on the internet for the effect of money on religion, I came

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:51.560
across several websites that explain how to form your own religion, what to say, what

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.520
to do with the whole purpose of getting rich.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:03.680
So once a religion is run by lovers of money, they're no longer lovers of truth or lovers

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.759
of God's word.

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:08.800
Sermons are no longer about Bible truth.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.520
They're more about what people are willing to pay for.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.079
People are even told that they can buy God's forgiveness.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.319
Basically, you can bribe God not to punish you.

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:25.600
It kind of goes like this, you've done bad.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:32.680
God is going to punish you, so give money to me in the church, and God will forgive you.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.199
You see, this scam and variations of it have a long history.

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:43.079
Indulgences sold by the Catholic church back in the 16th century are very good examples

00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:45.360
of such greed.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.399
Indulgences were basically the church saying you can pay for God not to punish you.

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:55.319
The awake August 1988 explained how Martin Luther felt about the Catholic church selling

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:57.360
such indulgences.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.959
It says the selling of indulgences originated during the Crusades when they were granted

00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:05.639
to believers willing to risk their lives in a holy war.

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:11.920
But later, they were extended to people offering financial support to the church.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:19.800
One indulgences became a convenient method of raising money, the bingo of the 16th century.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:26.279
With the sharp tongue for which he became noted, Martin Luther asked, if the Pope does have

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:31.079
the power to release anyone from purgatory, basically on the basis of indulgences of the

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:38.839
money, why in the name of love does he not abolish purgatory by letting everyone out?

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:39.839
End of quote.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.319
Well, this really should not surprise us.

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:49.439
The biggest bribe on record was the one Satan offered to Jesus.

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:54.759
Satan said, I will give you, bribe you, all the kingdoms of the world, basically pay

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:59.959
you if you fall down and do an act of worship to me.

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:06.040
Now let's contrast Satan's and Christendom's view on love of money with Jesus' words

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.420
at Matthew chapter 10 and verse 8.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.420
Matthew chapter 10 and verse 8.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:18.100
Now here Jesus was giving some instructions to his disciples about the message they should

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.899
give as they go out and preach the kingdom.

00:06:20.899 --> 00:06:28.779
And he told them, cure the sick, raise up the dead, make lepers clean, expel demons.

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:31.980
You received free gift free.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:37.259
Now why after stating these beautiful, wonderful things they could do for people, would Jesus

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:41.660
say something like you received free gift free?

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:49.060
Because Jesus knew that the love of money could corrupt these wonderful miracles that

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.300
they could do for others.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:59.019
I mean, Jesus had seen how money had corrupted many over the years he had seen mankind.

00:06:59.019 --> 00:07:05.899
For example, when he saw, when Namin wanted to give expensive gifts to Elisha because he

00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:11.220
had cured him of his leprosy, Elisha would not have any of it.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:17.579
See, Elisha knew that it was wrong to try to profit from the operation of God's Holy

00:07:17.579 --> 00:07:19.740
Spirit.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.579
Gehez, though, he couldn't resist.

00:07:22.579 --> 00:07:28.819
His love of money totally corrupted his faithful service.

00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:35.779
Of course today we can't cure leprosy or raise the dead, but the lesson that Jesus gave

00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:40.660
here in Matthew chapter 10 and verse 8 is still very applicable to us.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.939
You received free gift free.

00:07:44.939 --> 00:07:46.699
It's a clear message.

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:54.180
Don't accept money for the work of the Holy Spirit and the kingdom message and its blessings

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.740
are simply not for sale.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:03.060
Now, we're truly blessed to be part of God's Spirit-directed organization that are lovers

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:06.620
of God rather than lovers of money.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:10.500
We don't have collections at our meetings or our conventions.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:16.540
Donations are made discreetly and funds are used wisely and modestly.

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:23.220
And we also follow the Bible's requirement for elders in 1 Timothy chapter 3 that says

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:28.100
that elders should not be a lover of money.

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:32.460
See how important it is that the elders, those taking the lead, should not be a lover

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.460
of money.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.740
Otherwise, it can corrupt their relationship with the congregation.

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:42.500
Interestingly, that expression that they should not be a lover of money is the same expression

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:46.340
that's used in 2 Timothy 3 about what other people would be as lovers of money.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:51.740
And that's the only time that expression lovers of money are used in the scriptures.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:59.019
See when we see the corrupting influence that lovers of money have had on business, government,

00:08:59.019 --> 00:09:05.899
and false religion, it teaches us a very powerful lesson.

00:09:05.899 --> 00:09:09.980
Money has its proper place in our wallets, but not in our hearts.
