00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:12.839
All joining and dedicating this assembly hall to the worship of Jehovah God, our Grand King,

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:17.839
and the service of the Messianic King Jesus Christ, say yes.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:31.129
On December 3, 2016, a new assembly hall was dedicated in comedy

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:35.130
in the north of Italy some 30 miles from Milan.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.130
The dedication talk was given by brother Anthony Morris, a member of the governing body.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:48.130
Almost 4,000 people attended the live event, and just under 30,000 brothers from Piumont and Lumberty

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.130
were tied in from their kingdom halls.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.130
Over the past 30 years, the assembly hall had enabled thousands of brothers

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.130
to enjoy spiritual programs and association.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:06.129
However, in recent years, Anita rose to make it more suitable for the increasing number of publishers,

00:01:06.129 --> 00:01:12.129
so a decision was made to tear down the old assembly hall and build a bigger one.

00:01:12.129 --> 00:01:18.129
Before proceeding, planning permission for a change of use of land had to be obtained from the city council.

00:01:18.129 --> 00:01:21.129
Many attempts were made to obtain it.

00:01:21.129 --> 00:01:28.129
In the meantime, the decision was made to use temporary aluminum frame tents for summer conventions.

00:01:29.129 --> 00:01:33.129
With the help of two engineers, an architect and a surveyor,

00:01:33.129 --> 00:01:36.129
we went back to the city council for the empteenth time,

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:41.129
and this time the mayor said that we had the right to proceed with the construction.

00:01:41.129 --> 00:01:45.129
Oh, I will never forget the joy we felt that day in the month of July,

00:01:45.129 --> 00:01:48.129
with that suffocating heat, as we walked out of the office,

00:01:48.129 --> 00:01:51.129
got in the car which was parked in the sun,

00:01:51.129 --> 00:01:55.129
who were wearing our ties and jackets, and thank Jehovah in prayer.

00:01:55.129 --> 00:02:00.129
After praying, we realized that it was 120 degrees in the car.

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:05.129
So, in 2013, the construction work began.

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:10.129
The first stage of the project was carried out by an outside company.

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.129
Later, teams of brothers and sisters were organized

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:19.129
and they devoted their personal time to this theocratic project.

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:24.129
Altogether, there were more than 5,000 volunteers.

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:29.129
They experienced what Psalm 133 verse 1 says.

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:35.129
How good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity.

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.129
The instruction received from the world headquarters

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:43.129
was that a light roof should be built that was inexpensive and without pillars

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.129
so as not to obstruct the view of those in the audience.

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:49.129
After a year of design planning,

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:54.129
a roof was built with the best beam weight to load capacity ratio.

00:02:54.129 --> 00:03:00.129
Each beam weighs 11 tons and has a load capacity of 65 tons.

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:07.370
One big problem was to make the roof's vertical movement under snow

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.370
compatible with the load bearing beam supporting the panels

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.370
since the hole has a movable partition wall dividing it into two sections.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.370
We performed finite element simulations

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.370
which enabled us to estimate the actual movements of the building.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.370
And we solved the problem by building a telescopic structure

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.370
that enables the roof to slide as opposed to the load bearing beam supporting the panels,

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.370
which is very rigid, almost stationary.

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.370
There are some innovative design details that make this assembly hall unique.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:52.370
Another important feature of this assembly hall has to do with the acoustic walls.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.370
We realized that the shape of the hall was not acoustically ideal

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.370
for an audience of 4,000 people.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.370
With the help of consultants who are our brothers,

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.370
we figured out how to alternate sound absorbing panels

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.370
with sound reflecting panels,

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.370
which balances the sound in the entire hall.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.370
Another feature of this hall is the movable partition wall,

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.370
which makes it possible to have two assembly simultaneously.

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:27.370
This is the first wall in the world that makes it possible to have such a high level performance in terms of quality.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:36.569
I am truly amazed and it has made me realize that when you get together,

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:39.569
when you're united with a common purpose,

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:44.569
sharing strong values and principles, great things can be accomplished.

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:50.569
Such quick payments, I had never been asked to receive my money before.

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:54.569
This was the first time that others called me to get things paid.

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:58.569
The hall was empty, I walked in and side finished.

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:02.569
I hadn't seen it like this before, I was moved to tears.

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:07.569
You see, you worked for it, you were thinking about it,

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:12.569
even some sleepless nights and now you see the whole thing finished

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:15.569
and being put to Jehovah's Honour,

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:17.569
you can't describe that.

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:21.569
Brother Morris closed the dedication program

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:25.569
with an exhortation based on Ecclesiastes chapter 5 verse 1.

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:29.569
Guard your feet whenever you go to the house of the true God

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:32.569
and let there be a drawing near to here.
