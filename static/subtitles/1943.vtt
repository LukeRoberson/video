00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:14.980
Throughout Jesus' ministry, he taught about God's kingdom more than any other subject.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:22.780
For centuries, his followers have prayed for that kingdom to come.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.690
But what is the kingdom?

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.699
A kingdom is a type of government.

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:38.700
A government includes a ruler, a seat of government, a territory that is ruled over,

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.850
laws and citizens.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:52.570
Sadly, many human governments fail to meet the needs of their people, advancing their

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.409
own interests instead.

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:02.689
In contrast, God's kingdom has the perfect ruler, Jesus.

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:06.530
Someone God Himself chose to be king.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.010
But also selects others to be associate rulers with Jesus.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.129
This kingdom rules from heaven.

00:01:15.129 --> 00:01:19.689
It receives its power and authority from God.

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:27.010
Its domain will include the whole earth, eliminating problems caused by nationalism.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.969
And anyone who obeys its laws can be a citizen.

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:37.450
How will the kingdom benefit its citizens?

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:44.680
When on earth, Jesus showed through his miracles what God's kingdom would do.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.840
When Jesus calmed us down, he showed that as king, he will control earth's natural

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.370
forces, solving environmental problems.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:06.849
By miraculously feeding thousands, he demonstrated that the kingdom will eliminate world hunger.

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:14.770
In Jesus' heel, the sick, lame, death and blind, he gave us a preview of the perfect

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:21.500
health that all will enjoy under his rule.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:28.379
And by resurrecting people, he showed that through the kingdom, he will reverse death

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:29.379
itself.

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:42.319
You may wonder, when will God's kingdom rule the earth?

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:51.300
How can you support God's kingdom now?

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:59.340
