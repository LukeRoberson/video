00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.980
Welcome to JW Broadcasting.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.980
In this month's program, we'll meet a brother who preaches in the Indian Sign Language field.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.980
What can we learn from his view of the challenges he faces in his assignment?

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.980
Jehovah's sheep belong to him.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:25.980
This dramatization shows a special way that Jehovah uses shepherds in the congregation to care for his flock.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.979
And have you witnessed the life-changing moment when someone first learns God's name?

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:38.979
We'll see the results of this sister's lifelong search to know the true God.

00:00:38.979 --> 00:01:04.659
This and much more is ahead on the June 2016 edition of JW Broadcasting.

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.659
Jehovah's people have always considered the studying of his word to be an essential part of life.

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:19.659
God's law to Israel commanded that the king must read from the law all the days of his life so that he may learn to fear Jehovah his God.

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:28.659
In the Mayan territories of Yucatan, Mexico, our brothers are helping people learn to read God's word for themselves.

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:38.659
People's lives change when they can finally read the Bible on their own and more readily learn to fear Jehovah their God.

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:52.379
One of the six people on earth doesn't know how to read.

00:01:52.379 --> 00:02:01.709
Jehovah's Witnesses around the world have organized literacy classes to help such ones.

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:06.709
I don't like to read.

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:11.710
I used to sleep at the meetings.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:21.710
In the territory, most people speak the Mayan language, but very few can read it.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:27.710
On occasion I would give a talk and when I would cite a scripture, most of the audience would look it up.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.710
But then I would see a blank stare on their face because they couldn't read the text.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:43.710
I was moved to learn how to read because I wanted to learn about Jehovah and study his word the Bible.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.710
So a sister came to my house to teach me.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.710
Literacy classes are often conducted on an individual level.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:59.710
After a person has had their Bible study, they can spend some time to practice reading skills.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:10.710
But when the local elders notice that there are many that can benefit from this training, they can schedule a larger class at the Kingdom Hall.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:16.710
The study material used for this purpose is the brochure, apply yourself to reading and writing.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:22.710
It's available in 30 languages in the Central America branch territory.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:32.710
Other study materials can be used as well, as long as they help the development of the students enrolled in the class.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.710
And we use a board on which we write, for instance, words that are difficult to pronounce.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.710
This helps in the reading of complicated words.

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.710
There are some who are, well, very quick learners.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:54.710
On the other hand, others go word by word, but as they practice, they start getting the hang of it.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:03.710
I'm good at missionary work, but learning to read is not easy.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.710
Reading at his age is a big challenge.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:15.710
You need to understand that each student learns differently, with some you need to be very patient.

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.709
The first word I learned to write was Jehovah.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:26.709
It's like this, I tell him. He says, it's because you're not being patient with me.

00:04:26.709 --> 00:04:33.709
Having a sense of humor is a big help in the learning process, so it's not to focus on errors and mistakes.

00:04:33.709 --> 00:04:44.709
Since 1946, when records began being taken in Mexico, more than 152,000 people have learned to read and write thanks to these training efforts.

00:04:44.709 --> 00:04:54.709
The Secretary of Public Education in the state of Mexico has recognized the work and the great help these literacy classes have been to the local citizens.

00:04:54.709 --> 00:05:02.709
The skills they learn help in their day-to-day life, but also it helps them to learn more about Jehovah and to be able to teach others.

00:05:02.709 --> 00:05:13.709
I used to have to memorize everything I was going to say, but now I can read short scriptures to people directly from the Bible.

00:05:14.709 --> 00:05:23.709
As the students progress in the class, they demonstrate the words found at 1 Timothy 415, which says in part,

00:05:23.709 --> 00:05:32.709
so that your advancement may be plainly seen by all people, and these benefits are plainly seen in the students.

00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:41.709
My husband was an alcoholic, he smoked, and he used bad language, but he made big changes in his life.

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:49.709
And we see that this training has been a big help. We really see these great blessings.

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:55.709
Reading helped me to get baptized.

00:05:55.709 --> 00:06:00.709
Helping other people to improve their reading skills makes me feel very happy.

00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:07.709
I feel great because I see on their face the joy they get from reading and understanding the information.

00:06:07.709 --> 00:06:19.709
Well, I've benefited so much. For instance, now we read the Bible together as a family. It makes me very happy.

00:06:19.709 --> 00:06:28.709
We're more united as a family. Our children respect my husband more, like the father he is.

00:06:29.709 --> 00:06:40.709
Now I'm a ministerial servant. When I go preaching door to door, some people say, I don't know how to read.

00:06:40.709 --> 00:06:51.709
But then I tell them, I didn't know either, but I learned about Jehovah, and you can too.

00:06:52.709 --> 00:07:15.870
If I learned to read, anybody can.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:23.870
Our theme for this month is, consider, insight, and encourage one another all the more so.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:28.870
JW Broadcasting. Why do we enjoy it so much?

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:35.870
Many of you have expressed how the monthly broadcast draws you closer to our brothers and sisters and to Jehovah's organization.

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:40.870
If you're homebound or isolated, you especially treasure these programs.

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:46.870
And yet, while we appreciate the advances and technology that have made all of this possible,

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:54.870
we know that your sincere desire is to be present with your brothers and sisters in person at our congregation meetings.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:59.870
Jehovah's Witnesses around the world share this feeling.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:06.870
In Northern Finland, for example, winners are especially cold, even by Finnish standards.

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:13.870
At times, temperatures plummet to minus 50 degrees Celsius or minus 58 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:19.870
Under those conditions, it's very difficult to drive much less walk-long distances.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:24.870
Still, the brothers love to gather together. How do they manage it?

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:30.870
In one small village, there's a brother who lives near the Kingdom Hall and has a warm garage.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:35.870
On meeting nights, he uses his car to bring each family in the congregation to the hall,

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:40.870
then he parks in his garage and runs the short distance back to the Kingdom Hall.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:45.870
When the meeting is over, he returns all the friends safely to their homes.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:53.870
In the Bible, gatherings for pure worship were occasions for personal association with fellow believers.

00:08:54.870 --> 00:09:02.870
Such association required travel to a designated place. This involved work, sacrifice, even risk.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:07.870
Consider what is stated at Exodus chapter 34, verse 24.

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:16.870
This verse has to do with the command that every Israelite male should gather three times a year for the festivals in Jerusalem.

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:24.870
What would that mean in practical terms? Wouldn't the nation be left vulnerable to attack if no men were left to guard the land?

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:30.870
And if words spread among the surrounding nations that practically everyone congregated in Jerusalem three times a year,

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:39.870
like clockwork, year after year, wouldn't it be just a matter of time before some invading army would come and pillage in Israelite city?

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:46.870
At Exodus 34, 24, we find Jehovah's remarkable answer.

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:55.870
For I will drive the nations away from before you, and I will enlarge your territory, and nobody will desire.

00:09:55.870 --> 00:10:04.870
Yes, even desire your land while you are going up to see the face of Jehovah your God three times a year.

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:22.870
Jehovah kept that promise. It's a historical fact that from 1513 BCE, all the way down to 66 CE, no foreign nation ever came to invade Israelite territory during those three annual festivals.

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:29.870
Jehovah placed high value on having his people gather together in the same space.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:39.870
In the Christian era, the Apostle Paul wrote at 1 Corinthians 1423 about the whole congregation coming together to one place.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:53.870
Now, although modern broadcasting technology didn't exist in those days, there were other viable methods of communicating, such as writing letters, that didn't require people to be physically present in the same location.

00:10:53.870 --> 00:11:05.870
Still, the Apostle John, though a capable writer, preferred face-to-face interchange with fellow Christians as he expressed at 2 John 12.

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:11.870
Or consider what is stated at Job 16.

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:19.870
Now, the day came when the sons of the true God entered to take their station before Jehovah.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:38.870
Job 21 speaks of another such day. Just imagine, here Jehovah himself, though having all conceivable methods of communication at his disposal, set specific days for his spirit creatures in heaven to assemble in his immediate presence.

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:51.870
Clearly, the scriptures encourage regular personal association with fellow servants of God, virtual attendance through modern communication technology has value, and we're happy to use it.

00:11:51.870 --> 00:12:06.870
But it's no substitute for being together. And why not? Because of what association with the congregation achieves, it's not just that we receive nutritious and varied spiritual food, meetings inform us.

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:17.870
But so does JW Broadcasting, meetings encourage us. But so does JW Broadcasting, fellow Christians who offer comments and sing from the heart, build us up.

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:32.870
And yet, we can hear that also on JW Broadcasting. It's when we're together, altogether in one place that others can hear us and draw encouragement from our heartfelt convictions, our smile, our handshake.

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:43.870
Meetings give us opportunities to show our brothers and sisters that we esteem them as worthy of our time, attention and concern.

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:52.870
That's why we go and visit our brothers who are homebound or isolated because we want to show them that we love them.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:13:00.870
Moreover, in a special way, our meetings bring us under the influence of Holy Spirit.

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:06.870
At Revelation chapter 2, verse 7, the glorified Jesus said,

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:24.870
Let the one who has an ear hear what the Spirit says to the congregations. We need that spirit to help us resist temptation to embolden and equip us for the ministry and to enable us to make sound decisions.

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:41.870
Still, there's a reason to attend meetings that's even more important than the pleasant company, the peaceful atmosphere, the genuine refreshment, the sense of belonging, the opportunities to give, or even the fact that meetings are a means by which we received Jehovah's Holy Spirit.

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:47.870
The key reason why we gather together is stated at Psalm 2612.

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:56.870
My foot is standing on level ground in the great congregation I will praise Jehovah.

00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:08.870
Yes, the principal reason why we gather together in person is to give Jehovah what he deserves, praise, glory, yes, worship.

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:14.870
But our meeting attendance shows Jehovah that we want to draw close to him and his son.

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:19.870
In his abundant love, Jehovah invites many more to serve him and keep living.

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:25.870
Because he lives eternally, Jehovah can nurture those relationships forever.

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:37.870
The adversary can offer no such hope of endless life, so he promotes selfishness, pride, and other negative traits that isolate people from one another even when they're in the same room engaged in the same activities.

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:52.870
In contrast, our great God is drawing his people closer to himself, to his son, and to one another so that we may all be one as Jesus prayed, as recorded at John 1721.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:58.870
And it's not just the act of converging on the same location that unites us either.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:05.870
Lots of people coexist in the same space when they go to a market, attend a sporting event or use public transportation.

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:09.870
Crowding of itself does not equate with unity.

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:13.870
What makes the true Christian congregation different?

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:18.870
Notice how Hebrews chapter 10 verses 24 and 25 answers this question.

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:26.870
Now here we find the divinely inspired standard for all our gatherings.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:32.870
And let us consider one another so as to incite to love and find works.

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:44.870
Not forsaking our meeting together, some have the custom, but encouraging one another, and all the more so as you see the day drawing near.

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:55.870
Now what does it mean to consider one another? What does it mean to incite to love and find works? And in what way might we encourage one another?

00:15:55.870 --> 00:16:01.870
The verb consider could also be rendered be concerned about, pay attention to.

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:07.870
So when we consider one another, we show interest that goes far beyond a brief greeting.

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:16.870
And when we pay careful attention to one another, we're better prepared to incite, that is to motivate one another, to stir one another to action.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:18.870
And how might we do this?

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:24.870
Not by making comparisons or shaming our brothers for that would hardly be encouraging one another.

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:27.870
We endeavor to lift one another's hearts when we're together.

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:38.870
And when we do this to the best of our ability, then we can be confident that Jehovah's spirit will do the rest, and that our brothers will feel strengthened.

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:45.870
It's evident then that true worship means participation. It requires a response.

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:53.870
Another noteworthy example of this is the encouragement we both give and receive when we sing together with our brothers and sisters.

00:16:53.870 --> 00:17:03.870
In ancient Israel, at times they had a chorus, such as the one described in Nehemiah chapter 12 that we talked about in our midweek meeting back in February.

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:11.869
Much of Israel's group singing was antifinal, that is, some of the singers prompted others to respond.

00:17:11.869 --> 00:17:23.869
For instance, Psalm 106, which begins and ends with the words Praise Ja, or hallelujah, encourage the people to say in response, amen.

00:17:23.869 --> 00:17:36.869
Psalm 136 was written to allow for different choruses to answer one another. Now just imagine responding choruses singing these alternating lines.

00:17:36.869 --> 00:17:49.869
Give thanks to Jehovah for he is good. His loyal love endures forever. Give thanks to the God of gods for his loyal love endures forever.

00:17:49.869 --> 00:17:58.869
Give thanks to the Lord of lords for his loyal love endures forever, and on it went for 26 verses.

00:17:58.869 --> 00:18:05.869
To this day, singing demonstrates our heartfelt response to the goodness of Jehovah.

00:18:05.869 --> 00:18:12.869
And what a joy it is to sing in company with others who are moved to pour out the depths of their feelings to Jehovah.

00:18:12.869 --> 00:18:22.869
And now at our kingdom halls, we're accompanied by orchestral renderings of many of our songs, and other reason to sing out at our midweek and weekend meetings.

00:18:22.869 --> 00:18:30.869
And speaking of the midweek meeting, how are you enjoying the new format? More of the program is devoted to delving into the Bible itself.

00:18:30.869 --> 00:18:43.869
Time spent on preparing us for our public ministry focuses more than ever on situations we face in field service, and the meetings move along at a satisfying pace.

00:18:44.869 --> 00:18:55.869
Yes, JW Broadcasting is a wonderful blessing, a powerful means to talk to and fortify our brothers around the world simultaneously.

00:18:55.869 --> 00:19:06.869
Still, nothing can replace the experience of worshipping Jehovah in concert with our fellow servants of God at congregation meetings.

00:19:06.869 --> 00:19:19.869
When a meeting concludes, and we lift our heads after the final prayer, we find ourselves surrounded by others who love Jehovah and support his sovereignty.

00:19:19.869 --> 00:19:27.869
These important benefits are detailed in the April 2016 study article, why should we meet together for worship?

00:19:27.869 --> 00:19:37.869
This month, we're studying that article worldwide. Later, in October, we begin a special campaign to invite the public to our meetings.

00:19:37.869 --> 00:19:48.869
If you do not yet regularly associate with Jehovah's Witnesses, or if you travel away from your congregation, use JW.org to find a meeting you can attend.

00:19:48.869 --> 00:20:01.869
Click about us, meetings, and find a location near you, or simply scroll to the bottom of any JW.org page and click attend our meetings.

00:20:01.869 --> 00:20:14.869
At our meetings, you'll experience what it means to consider, insight, and encourage one another all the more so as we see the day drawing near.

00:20:14.869 --> 00:20:23.630
We've discussed vital ways we benefit when we come together for worship at Christian meetings.

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:31.630
What many notice when they first attend meetings of Jehovah's Witnesses is that they hear God's name Jehovah.

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:42.630
In this life story, Sotan Yuan relates the impact that learning God's name had on her after surviving the killing fields of Cambodia.

00:20:42.630 --> 00:21:05.680
On the killing fields in Cambodia, I prayed to God, but I didn't know His name.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:17.680
When I was a very young girl, they subredd of a family, and they put me to work in a rice field from five in the morning till nine in the evening.

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:29.680
When you see some other children that get killed, you really desperately cry for help inside. You always think that you were next.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:36.680
But in my heart, I always believe that it has to be a true God somewhere, somehow, that can help me get through this.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:43.859
One year later, my family decided to escape Cambodia.

00:21:43.859 --> 00:21:57.420
We walk close to 6-7 months to Thailand, and I have 20 brothers and sisters, only four of us are wife.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:09.460
I have a blind on that hold on my shoulder all the time, but one day we got caught.

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:21.140
As they start shooting, I push my on down to the ground and try to pretend that we are dead.

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:31.809
And when I get up, I have no idea where my parent was, and we spent many months in a jungle.

00:22:31.809 --> 00:22:37.809
As I try to survive, I eat what I work and find, and I also help my aunt eat to survive.

00:22:37.809 --> 00:22:45.809
One day when I go out to look for food, I walk so far away, I couldn't find my way back.

00:22:46.809 --> 00:22:56.809
I start crying really hard underneath the tree, and look up to the sky, and pray to the true God.

00:22:56.809 --> 00:23:04.809
I was raised as a child to pray to Buddha, but on this night, when I start praying,

00:23:04.809 --> 00:23:15.180
I specifically said that I am not praying to Buddha, I am praying to the true God, and I say,

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:27.750
true God, if you are really here, please help me, because I am really scared, and I am hungry, I am cold.

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:34.160
After I pray, I just fall to sleep under the big tree.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:42.160
Eventually, I make it into the refugee camp in Thailand, and I was reunited with my family.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:50.160
We live in the refugee camp in Thailand for about ten years, before we come to the United States.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:54.160
My searching for the true God, it didn't stop there.

00:23:54.160 --> 00:24:00.160
We tried to go to different churches, but we didn't understand anything.

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:09.160
One day when I come home from school, I met this gentleman named Harold, and he asked if he can talk to me about God.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:14.160
I agree, because I saw he had a Bible, he must be a good man.

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:24.160
When he talked to me, I tried to pay attention, so hard, but I still didn't understand what he was saying.

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:32.160
When he went very slow, and then he said, your name, I say my name so 10, and then he said, your name so 10,

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:38.160
my name's Harold, God's name, Jehovah.

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:45.160
I never thought God had name, and I was in that day on, and I will forget Jehovah's name.

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:48.160
It's super glue in my heart.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:57.160
He gave me his phone number, he said, how can I ask his wife to stop by someday, but then I moved away from where I live.

00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:04.160
Even though I didn't do the truth at that time, I always prayed to Jehovah.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:15.160
After I learned God's name, I went back to the church, the priest would start out with Heavenly Father, but live out Jehovah's name.

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:23.160
So I raised my hand, I asked him, sir, when you pray Heavenly Father, why don't you say Heavenly Father Jehovah?

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:28.160
Why are you not using God's name?

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:38.160
And then he told me that God does not force me to be here, so I welcome to leave or stay if I want.

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:46.160
So because I realized that they don't use Jehovah's name, I left, and never return.

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:57.140
And after many years, I tried to call Harold, but no one picked up the phone, so I live a message.

00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:00.140
I was hoping that they'd remember me.

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:12.059
Two weeks later, Harold came to my door, but at the time I was working at night and sleep during the day,

00:26:12.059 --> 00:26:25.960
but Harold never gave up, he came back, and I keep on praying to Jehovah, asking for someone to knock on my door.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:37.960
And finally, one day, I opened a door, and when I saw him, I almost couldn't talk, I was tear up, I was so happy to see him.

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:41.960
Because this is the man who introduced me to Jehovah's name.

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:48.960
Eventually, I started to study with sister, and she helped me grow spiritually.

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:54.960
To know that you have a Heavenly Father, that care about you.

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.960
That was the best feeling on earth.

00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:01.960
It makes me want to know more about him, want to learn more about him.

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:05.960
I would ask questions, did he like this? Did he like that?

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:16.690
And then, when I go to the camp tomorrow, I hear Jehovah's name so many times.

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:20.690
I feel that's it, I found my place.

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:24.690
I got baptized in 2013.

00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:31.690
My blind aunt, that I helped her survive through the jungle, she's still living until today.

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:37.690
And now that I can get a chance to talk to her about Jehovah, that was a blessing.

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:48.690
And I can't stress enough how wonderful and make privilege that I receive from Jehovah just to know who he is.

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:58.690
And to learn that there is true God, he has a name, and his name is Jehovah.

00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:14.839
Sister UN still carries painful memories from what she and her family suffered because of man's ruthless wars.

00:28:14.839 --> 00:28:23.839
But she now has hope for the future and the comfort of knowing her Heavenly Father, Jehovah, something we all share with her.

00:28:23.839 --> 00:28:30.839
Sister UN has the added joy of worshiping the true God together with her husband and young daughter.

00:28:30.839 --> 00:28:39.839
When we're at our meetings, we helped the congregation to stay close together part of the one flock that follows the one shepherd.

00:28:39.839 --> 00:28:50.660
In the following dramatization, note the way in which one young man receives Jehovah's love through faithful undershepherds.

00:28:50.660 --> 00:29:00.660
I always loved music. I got my first guitar when I was 15. And since then, it's been my wave expressing myself.

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:10.099
When they ask, Dave, do you want to join the band? I didn't have to think twice.

00:29:10.099 --> 00:29:15.099
Making music, that's all that really mattered to me.

00:29:15.099 --> 00:29:22.099
I thought being a musician would make me happy. So that is the path I followed.

00:29:22.099 --> 00:29:40.630
Only it is not what I thought it to be. I work here during the day to pay the bills.

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:47.630
I thought my life would turn out better, but something was missing.

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:58.359
Instead of being happy, I just felt lost.

00:29:58.359 --> 00:30:25.650
Man, I'm distracted. They are friendly and look happy. He gave me a tract and said, many people are searching for true happiness.

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:47.339
Maybe you are one of them. This could help. I quickly wrote down my address and asked whether they would mind passing by after I finished my shift.

00:30:47.339 --> 00:30:59.430
I was searching all right. Actually, the answers were in front of me all along.

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:19.700
How come I only get it now? You see, I was baptized, but I never gave the truth a chance.

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:42.640
Roy did come as promised. I told him I'm a baptized brother. He really listened to me.

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:55.460
Then he shared Psalm 100 verse 3. Know that Jehovah is God. He is the one who made us, and we belong to Him.

00:31:55.460 --> 00:32:03.460
We are His people and the sheep of His pasture. In the Bible, Jehovah is likened to a shepherd.

00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:10.460
He knows every single one of His sheep, and He knows when one goes missing.

00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:20.460
A lost sheep is not a lost cause. It still belongs to Him, and Jehovah doesn't spare any efforts in searching for it.

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:38.579
Until He finds it, I was like one of those lost sheep, but I still belong to Jehovah, and He has never forgotten about me.

00:32:38.579 --> 00:33:02.670
Roy promised we would keep in touch, and invited me to the Sunday meeting, and I was nervous that morning.

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:17.710
I wanted to look my best. Roy and Matthew were waiting for me, giving me a warm welcome.

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:30.829
Something I'll never forget. I missed this. This is indeed Jehovah's congregation.

00:33:30.829 --> 00:33:51.700
This is where I belong. The truth has never been so clear to me. I enjoy the close company of my brothers and sisters.

00:33:51.700 --> 00:34:10.059
What I enjoy most is helping others to find our loving father, Jehovah. With Jehovah's help, I will never be lost again.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:27.000
The November 2015 broadcast stressed that there is no better place to be than in Jehovah's protective arms.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:35.000
Those who have drifted away from Jehovah were then, and are still now warmly encouraged to act without delay.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:44.000
As we saw depicted, Jehovah provides shepherds who care for his sheep and lovingly guide them back into his organization.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:53.000
When the preaching work was getting started in such countries as South Korea, Jehovah often used missionaries to help strengthen our brothers.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:35:05.820
In an archived interview, Brother Jong Il Park describes the effect this had on his sacred service, and how it prepared him for the trials he would face.

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:15.820
From 1939, our brothers didn't have any contact with Jehovah's organization, and they thought that no organization exists.

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:27.820
Then in 1948, a brother read from a newspaper about the activity of watchtower society, and it surprised the brothers.

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:39.820
So, brothers wrote the society and the society was so happy hearing from Korean brothers, and they answered with many booklets in Korean.

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:48.820
There were two different reactions. Some brothers was excited about preaching work yet another group.

00:35:49.820 --> 00:36:02.820
Question, is that true organization of Jehovah, first missionary group brother and sister still arrived in August 9th, 1949?

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:13.820
All the questions were answered by a brother still, and then right away, brothers were preaching in unity.

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:27.190
I began pioneering in January 1950, and then March 1950, six more missionaries arrived from Gilles' school.

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:34.190
We had only one congregation in Seoul, and the missionaries were busy for many Bible studies.

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:52.190
So many interested persons coming to the meeting, the public talk was arranged in school auditorium first time, and there were over 360 people attending.

00:36:53.190 --> 00:37:16.139
Whereas the public was about 60, the same day Korean War broke out, and the missionaries had to leave in 27th of June to Japan.

00:37:16.139 --> 00:37:24.139
And then our brothers had to take refuge to a thousand parts of Korea.

00:37:24.139 --> 00:37:33.139
I was hiding in the country, then a few days later, the secret police from communist found us.

00:37:33.139 --> 00:37:43.139
We explained to him, as a Christian, we cannot participate in the war, so we had to hide ourselves.

00:37:45.449 --> 00:37:55.449
And then he says, well, I do not know much about religion, so I better take one of my friends who knows about religion.

00:37:55.449 --> 00:38:02.449
So I will come back tomorrow, don't leave from here.

00:38:02.449 --> 00:38:08.449
So then we waited until next day, and he came with another.

00:38:08.449 --> 00:38:23.449
So I started preaching from the Bible, that why this war broke out, and many problems in the war, so on, because the fulfillment of Jesus' prophecy in May 24.

00:38:23.449 --> 00:38:30.449
Then they said that, well, thank you very much for your preaching, and then say goodbye.

00:38:30.449 --> 00:38:37.449
Then two days later, the latter one came with another friend, so that we could preach to them.

00:38:37.449 --> 00:38:43.449
During three months, they were staying in Seoul, and in fact, they protected us.

00:38:43.449 --> 00:39:03.380
I was picked by South Korean Army, and to serve the back support of the military in front line, to carry arms to the soldiers.

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:08.380
Which I could not accept.

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:25.300
So I refused it, and then I was beat, and then one day this company has to move to other place.

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:36.300
So they hide myself in the behind of the ceiling, and so that they do not notice when they leave the place.

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:42.300
And the next morning, when I came down, there was nothing left.

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:54.300
I walked on one street toward one direction, and then I found a sign, says International Bible Students Association.

00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:59.300
So I stayed with the brothers for six months.

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:08.300
Brother Steer came back from Japan by himself, so that they take care of the brothers.

00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:20.300
In 1952, Brother Steer recommended me to Gilles school, so that I was invited in 22nd class.

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:31.300
So I took the steps to get the passport, and then the government found out that I didn't serve military.

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:37.300
They gave me the draft notice instead of passport.

00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:49.940
So I had to stand for the neutrality instead of going Gilles school, which made me to be confined in military prison for two years.

00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:57.940
In 1958, I was enrolled in Gilles school in 32nd class.

00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:03.940
I really appreciate that Gilles school training.

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:18.940
Since my job in the branch, especially in translation work, and translation work involves a deep knowledge, and the Gilles training was certainly helped in translation work.

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:29.940
We are appreciation about the truth and the organization, the brothers' qualities, the humbleness, and weakness.

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:38.940
Certainly, it helped me to follow the examples to apply in the full-time service.

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:50.989
Did you know what Brother Park said he appreciated most, even after enduring persecution and prison for his faith?

00:41:50.989 --> 00:41:57.989
It was the Christ-like qualities of his brothers, and the training he received from Jehovah's organization.

00:41:57.989 --> 00:42:02.989
Another example of the benefits that result from our meeting together.

00:42:02.989 --> 00:42:12.989
If you'd like to find more ways to imitate Brother Park's faith, you can read his life story beginning on page 12 of the December 2008 issue of Awake.

00:42:12.989 --> 00:42:21.989
Like many older ones before them, younger brothers and sisters are taking on challenging assignments that bring them rich spiritual rewards.

00:42:21.989 --> 00:42:26.989
We go next to India, to hear from Brother Francis Rodrigs.

00:42:26.989 --> 00:42:33.989
He's using his training from the School for Kingdom Evangelizers to teach people in the Indian Sign Language field.

00:42:33.989 --> 00:42:41.989
When I was younger, there were two special pioneers who were assigned in the nearby congregation, and I was seeing how happy they were in serving Jehovah.

00:42:42.989 --> 00:42:49.989
I had a choice to make, to work overseas, but I decided to serve Jehovah in the full-time service.

00:42:49.989 --> 00:42:54.989
In the special full-time service, Jehovah is taking care of all my needs.

00:42:54.989 --> 00:43:00.989
I try to be a useful tool in his hand, and let him use me wherever he wants me to be used.

00:43:00.989 --> 00:43:07.980
From the past one year, I have been assigned to the Indian Sign Language field.

00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:15.429
I have been to almost 20 untouched territories.

00:43:15.429 --> 00:43:18.429
We start with the deaf search at 7 in the morning.

00:43:18.429 --> 00:43:23.429
Most of the people in the villages are farmers, and they come back for a short break.

00:43:23.429 --> 00:43:37.969
We reach till 9 or 9.30 in the night, and then I travel overnight to another village, and at 7 we again start with the Bible studies.

00:43:37.969 --> 00:43:40.969
This I do four times a week.

00:43:40.969 --> 00:43:45.969
There was a deaf school where we were giving memorial invitations.

00:43:46.969 --> 00:43:51.969
Some students just come running towards us, and they do like Jehovah love.

00:43:51.969 --> 00:43:56.969
And we are like, how do you know us? Because we never met those school children.

00:43:56.969 --> 00:44:03.969
Then we saw a boy who had just attended the meeting once, and he came to the school and told all his friends about it.

00:44:03.969 --> 00:44:09.969
And they were like, please you come once to this place and teach us more about Jehovah.

00:44:09.969 --> 00:44:14.969
Sometimes we meet the deaf ones who have never been to school.

00:44:14.969 --> 00:44:19.969
So sometimes we make their parents sit with them, and we see how they communicate with each other.

00:44:19.969 --> 00:44:22.969
And then we adapt to their sign language.

00:44:22.969 --> 00:44:28.969
Another place which is 10 hours far from here, initially it was just two or three deaf people who were interested.

00:44:28.969 --> 00:44:31.969
But later on it started increasing.

00:44:31.969 --> 00:44:34.969
We would have the first Bible study at 7 in the morning.

00:44:34.969 --> 00:44:36.969
Turned by turn, everyone would come.

00:44:36.969 --> 00:44:42.969
Sometimes there would be so many of them that we would have 10 to 12 in a group, and we would have a Bible study with them.

00:44:42.969 --> 00:44:45.969
We had to end the Bible study at 8.30 in the night.

00:44:45.969 --> 00:44:50.969
Because I had a 10-odd train journey back home.

00:44:50.969 --> 00:44:53.969
We planned to visit the branch office.

00:44:53.969 --> 00:44:57.969
And after the two of the two deaf girls started crying.

00:44:57.969 --> 00:45:01.969
They said they love that this weather sister showed us.

00:45:01.969 --> 00:45:05.969
Now we feel that Jehovah is the only true God.

00:45:05.969 --> 00:45:08.969
Since then they have been making many changes in their life.

00:45:08.969 --> 00:45:11.969
And now one of the girls is an unbaptized publisher.

00:45:11.969 --> 00:45:14.969
When I see the deaf ones doing changes in their life.

00:45:14.969 --> 00:45:16.969
They are being happy.

00:45:16.969 --> 00:45:19.969
And also having a good relationship with Jehovah.

00:45:19.969 --> 00:45:23.309
That makes me more happier.

00:45:23.309 --> 00:45:26.309
There are many challenges in their assignment.

00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:30.309
Sometimes I have to travel 10 hours to a village.

00:45:30.309 --> 00:45:32.309
And traveling does make me tired.

00:45:32.309 --> 00:45:37.460
Sometimes the trains are overly packed.

00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:40.460
Many times the late by almost three hours.

00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:44.460
Or sometimes even cancel due to which we have to go back home.

00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:46.460
Challenges will come.

00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:48.460
But they will also go.

00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:50.460
I try not to get stuck on them.

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:53.460
I pray to Jehovah not to remove these challenges.

00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:56.460
But to give me the strength to overcome these challenges.

00:45:56.460 --> 00:46:01.460
I feel that challenges are nothing when compared to the benefit that I see.

00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:07.500
When I focus on that, I really enjoy my assignment.

00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:11.500
Brother Rodriguez searches for those rightly disposed forever lasting life.

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:15.500
Wherever he can find them, despite the obstacles.

00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:19.500
And you may have noted that his joy comes from directing people to the congregation

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:23.500
to be part of our true spiritual brotherhood.

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:26.500
That example is repeated millions of times over

00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:31.500
through the diligent efforts of publishers and pioneers around the world.

00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:35.500
Why not examine your ministry to find ways to help yet more people

00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:39.500
to build a good relationship with Jehovah?

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:42.500
As we've seen, just in this program,

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:46.500
examples of faith come in a variety of forms.

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:48.500
In the April 2016 program,

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:51.500
we saw the first two installments in the series

00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:54.500
viewpoints on the origin of life.

00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:59.500
We'll now enjoy two more examples of those whose backgrounds in scientific study

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:08.619
enabled them to cultivate strong faith in the creator.

00:47:08.619 --> 00:47:11.619
My name is Racio Picado Herrero.

00:47:11.619 --> 00:47:16.619
I studied chemistry at the University of Salamanca in Spain.

00:47:16.619 --> 00:47:20.619
I specialize in organic chemistry.

00:47:20.619 --> 00:47:23.619
This field focuses on the study of the carbon atom

00:47:23.619 --> 00:47:28.619
and all the compounds that are derived from this atom.

00:47:28.619 --> 00:47:32.619
I believed that life came about through evolution.

00:47:32.619 --> 00:47:35.619
I remember seeing a picture in a natural science book

00:47:35.619 --> 00:47:38.619
that depicted the embryos of different vertebrates.

00:47:38.619 --> 00:47:40.619
And in the early stages of development,

00:47:40.619 --> 00:47:43.619
the similarities were outstanding.

00:47:43.619 --> 00:47:46.619
But when I started studying at the University,

00:47:46.619 --> 00:47:48.619
I began studying in detail the process

00:47:48.619 --> 00:47:51.619
on which the evolution theory is based.

00:47:51.619 --> 00:47:57.619
To my surprise, I discovered that these processes were not proven facts.

00:47:57.619 --> 00:48:02.619
As a chemist, I'm fascinated by the distribution of atoms within a molecule.

00:48:02.619 --> 00:48:04.619
In living creatures,

00:48:04.619 --> 00:48:08.619
the 20 amino acids that are vital for the synthesis of life,

00:48:08.619 --> 00:48:11.619
the basic proteins required for life,

00:48:12.619 --> 00:48:16.619
interestingly, are all laboratory or left-handed.

00:48:16.619 --> 00:48:20.619
So when a ray of polarized light arrives,

00:48:20.619 --> 00:48:24.619
these amino acids divert the light toward the left.

00:48:24.619 --> 00:48:27.619
There is no explanation for this,

00:48:27.619 --> 00:48:31.619
because the logical thing would be that if this were a random process,

00:48:31.619 --> 00:48:33.619
half would be right-handed,

00:48:33.619 --> 00:48:39.320
and the other half would be left-handed.

00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:41.320
I asked myself,

00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:45.320
how could evolution produce compounds that are leverodatory,

00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:52.619
and precisely the ones essential for life?

00:48:52.619 --> 00:48:56.619
In the end, I had to conclude that there must be a force,

00:48:56.619 --> 00:48:59.619
a designer, a creator of life,

00:48:59.619 --> 00:49:02.619
and of the elements in the amino acids required for life.

00:49:02.619 --> 00:49:05.619
Even though I had a religious upbringing,

00:49:05.619 --> 00:49:09.619
my ideas were not clear as to who God was.

00:49:09.619 --> 00:49:12.619
I merely viewed him as a supreme being,

00:49:12.619 --> 00:49:16.619
before whom we would be held accountable.

00:49:16.619 --> 00:49:18.619
The Bible is not a science textbook.

00:49:18.619 --> 00:49:21.619
Its purpose is not to describe the universe we live in,

00:49:21.619 --> 00:49:24.619
or the laws that regulate our universe.

00:49:24.619 --> 00:49:26.619
But when it does mention science,

00:49:26.619 --> 00:49:28.619
and when it discusses scientific matters,

00:49:28.619 --> 00:49:31.619
it does so with great accuracy.

00:49:31.619 --> 00:49:33.619
And undoubtedly, the greatest benefit

00:49:33.619 --> 00:49:36.619
is that it allows me to enjoy a personal relationship

00:49:36.619 --> 00:49:38.619
with the creator of the universe,

00:49:38.619 --> 00:49:46.969
a universe that fascinates me from a scientific perspective.

00:49:46.969 --> 00:49:48.969
My name is Davey Laws.

00:49:48.969 --> 00:49:51.969
I studied biochemistry at the University of Leuven in Belgium,

00:49:51.969 --> 00:49:55.969
and after that time, I did a PhD in the same area.

00:49:55.969 --> 00:49:59.969
When I was a young child, I believed in the Bible,

00:49:59.969 --> 00:50:03.969
but growing up, I kind of lost my interest in it.

00:50:03.969 --> 00:50:06.969
When you go to university and you study life sciences

00:50:06.969 --> 00:50:08.969
or biochemistry, for example,

00:50:08.969 --> 00:50:11.969
you get introduced into the idea of the origin of life very quickly,

00:50:11.969 --> 00:50:14.969
and also into the principle of evolution.

00:50:14.969 --> 00:50:16.969
The professors who talked these courses,

00:50:16.969 --> 00:50:19.969
they were really scientists with long careers,

00:50:19.969 --> 00:50:21.969
and they were well-established scientists,

00:50:21.969 --> 00:50:23.969
and we had a lot of respect for them,

00:50:23.969 --> 00:50:25.969
so there was just no way to really question

00:50:25.969 --> 00:50:27.969
the principle of evolution.

00:50:27.969 --> 00:50:33.409
In 1999, there was a war in Europe in Kosovo,

00:50:33.409 --> 00:50:37.409
and I remember reading in the Bible as a child

00:50:37.409 --> 00:50:40.409
about the future events that would take place.

00:50:41.409 --> 00:50:44.409
I started wondering whether the war in Kosovo

00:50:44.409 --> 00:50:45.409
was one of those events,

00:50:45.409 --> 00:50:49.690
so that led me to pick up the Bible again.

00:50:49.690 --> 00:50:52.690
At the time, I felt that I had to re-examine my beliefs

00:50:52.690 --> 00:50:56.690
about the origin of life and also about the principle of evolution.

00:50:58.690 --> 00:51:00.690
Based on the theory of evolution,

00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:03.690
we would expect to see an abundance of transitional forms

00:51:03.690 --> 00:51:05.690
to be present in the fossil record.

00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:07.690
But when we do look at the fossil evidence,

00:51:07.690 --> 00:51:09.690
we just don't see that.

00:51:09.690 --> 00:51:13.690
The major species come into existence at specific times,

00:51:13.690 --> 00:51:16.690
and their form and structure is still exactly the same

00:51:16.690 --> 00:51:19.690
as their form and structure today.

00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:23.690
It was actually Darwin himself who wrote in his book

00:51:23.690 --> 00:51:27.690
that the biggest objection that could be brought against his theory

00:51:27.690 --> 00:51:31.690
would be the fact that the fossil record does not show

00:51:31.690 --> 00:51:34.690
an abundance of transitional forms,

00:51:34.690 --> 00:51:38.690
and that's what really happened if you look at the set of data,

00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:43.690
the fossil record seems to prove the opposite of evolution.

00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:47.690
As a biochemist, I had the opportunity to learn about

00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:50.690
and study many different biomolecules,

00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:53.690
and I observed that pretty much every biomolecule

00:51:53.690 --> 00:51:56.690
is really a complex molecule.

00:51:56.690 --> 00:52:00.690
We can look at them as nanoscale molecular motors

00:52:00.690 --> 00:52:05.690
or machines that are performing very complex and specific tasks.

00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:08.690
For me, the complexity that we see in nature

00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:10.690
and the complexity in those molecules

00:52:10.690 --> 00:52:13.690
points to the fact that they're really as a creator.

00:52:13.690 --> 00:52:17.380
Did you see common ground that could help you

00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:21.380
in your next discussion with someone who believes in evolution?

00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:24.380
When Sister Picado Herrero's chemistry research

00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:26.380
showed evidence of design,

00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:28.380
she called to mind her view of God

00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:30.380
from her religious upbringing.

00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:33.380
The person you meet who believes in evolution

00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:35.380
might also have unanswered questions about God

00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:37.380
from their upbringing,

00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:40.380
and they may respond to the simple evidences of a creator

00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:42.380
that you present.

00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:45.380
Brother Lose was moved by world events

00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:48.380
to pick up the Bible and re-examine his beliefs.

00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:52.380
Everyone we meet, even firm believers in evolution,

00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:54.380
are affected by world conditions

00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:57.380
and may listen to our message of hope.

00:52:57.380 --> 00:53:00.380
So when someone says that he believes in evolution,

00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:03.380
don't be quick to assume that he'll reject the good news.

00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:07.380
Really, our ministry and other aspects of life

00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:09.380
often improve when we slow down,

00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:11.380
take our time,

00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:13.380
and as our music video admonishes,

00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:15.380
don't run fast.

00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:33.099
We shouldn't run at all in the Kingdom Hall,

00:53:33.099 --> 00:53:35.099
but in a figurative sense,

00:53:35.099 --> 00:53:37.099
this counts as a matter of time.

00:53:37.099 --> 00:53:40.099
We shouldn't run at all in the Kingdom Hall,

00:53:40.099 --> 00:56:00.719
but in a figurative sense,

00:56:00.719 --> 00:56:04.719
this counsel not to run fast applies to more than just our young ones.

00:56:04.719 --> 00:56:05.719
As we saw,

00:56:05.719 --> 00:56:08.719
even when we're busy with important theocratic work,

00:56:08.719 --> 00:56:11.719
we can still take the time to consider,

00:56:11.719 --> 00:56:12.719
insight,

00:56:12.719 --> 00:56:14.719
and encourage our brothers.

00:56:14.719 --> 00:56:17.719
And rather than rushing through our field service,

00:56:17.719 --> 00:56:20.719
we want to imitate Jesus' focus on finding people

00:56:20.719 --> 00:56:23.719
and reaching hearts.

00:56:23.719 --> 00:56:26.719
Jehovah reaches our hearts in ever so many ways,

00:56:26.719 --> 00:56:28.719
such as when we are in the Kingdom,

00:56:28.719 --> 00:56:30.719
in ever so many ways,

00:56:30.719 --> 00:56:32.719
such as when we attend our spiritual gatherings.

00:56:32.719 --> 00:56:36.719
By now, some of you have already attended the 2016

00:56:36.719 --> 00:56:39.719
Remain Loyal to Jehovah Regional Convention,

00:56:39.719 --> 00:56:43.719
but millions of us still have an exciting three days ahead,

00:56:43.719 --> 00:56:45.719
with 47 well-prepared talks,

00:56:45.719 --> 00:56:48.719
18 songs that will sing to Jehovah

00:56:48.719 --> 00:56:52.719
and more than 50 audio and video presentations,

00:56:52.719 --> 00:56:54.719
including two feature-length dramas.

00:56:54.719 --> 00:56:57.719
All of these program parts have been prepared

00:56:57.719 --> 00:57:00.719
to help us remain loyal to God,

00:57:00.719 --> 00:57:02.719
despite serious challenges.

00:57:02.719 --> 00:57:06.719
For instance, how can we maintain our loyalty when under stress

00:57:06.719 --> 00:57:07.719
or temptation?

00:57:07.719 --> 00:57:10.719
What did Jehovah personally teach Job

00:57:10.719 --> 00:57:12.719
that can strengthen our loyalty?

00:57:12.719 --> 00:57:16.719
And why does the Bible say that Jehovah's loyal love

00:57:16.719 --> 00:57:19.719
is more precious than life itself?

00:57:19.719 --> 00:57:22.719
To find out more of what you can expect,

00:57:22.719 --> 00:57:24.719
review the full convention program

00:57:24.719 --> 00:57:27.719
which can be downloaded from jw.org.

00:57:27.719 --> 00:57:29.719
You won't want to miss any part

00:57:29.719 --> 00:57:33.719
of the Remain Loyal to Jehovah Convention program.

00:57:33.719 --> 00:57:36.719
As we close, we bring you greetings

00:57:36.719 --> 00:57:38.719
from the Las Peralas,

00:57:38.719 --> 00:57:40.719
No Berry Congregation, and Panama.

00:57:40.719 --> 00:57:43.719
The Volcan region is the highest point in the country,

00:57:43.719 --> 00:57:46.719
enjoying a cool climate for growing coffee

00:57:46.719 --> 00:57:49.719
and a variety of vegetables.

00:57:49.719 --> 00:57:52.719
The busy harvest work from October to December

00:57:52.719 --> 00:57:57.719
brings large numbers of No Berry speaking people to the area.

00:57:57.719 --> 00:58:00.719
Their kind nature gives our brothers excellent opportunities

00:58:00.719 --> 00:58:03.719
to teach them about God's kingdom.

00:58:03.719 --> 00:58:06.719
Local brothers and sisters provide regular support

00:58:06.719 --> 00:58:09.719
to the No Berry Remote Translation Office,

00:58:09.719 --> 00:58:12.719
and some are making the effort to learn the language

00:58:12.719 --> 00:58:16.719
to assist in the congregation's spiritual harvest.

00:58:16.719 --> 00:58:23.599
We send them our warm Christian love and greetings in return,

00:58:23.599 --> 00:58:28.599
and pray for them to continue in their zealous spirit.

00:58:28.599 --> 00:58:32.599
We thank you, and hope you've enjoyed our program.

00:58:32.599 --> 00:58:37.599
This is JW Broadcasting from Brooklyn, New York.
