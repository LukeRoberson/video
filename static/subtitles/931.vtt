WEBVTT

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:29.969
Welcome back brothers and sisters for the second session of the 2022 Pursue Peace Convention

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:33.289
of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:38.929
This session corresponds to the Friday afternoon section on your program, and it will continue

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:49.210
to develop the scriptural theme from Psalm 2911, Jehovah will bless his people with peace.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.170
Let's begin with a music video presentation.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.609
As Jehovah's people, we love to tell others about our God and our hope.

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:04.209
The following video features brothers and sisters sharing the good news of peace around

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:06.730
the globe.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.730
We'll also see the work done at various Bethel facilities and support of this worldwide

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.409
preaching work.

00:01:13.409 --> 00:10:44.480
Enjoy!

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:49.480
Jehovah's promises of peace bring us great delight.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:54.799
When we think about what life will be like in God's new world, it fills our hearts with

00:10:54.799 --> 00:10:58.799
appreciation and love for Jehovah.

00:10:58.799 --> 00:11:06.399
Let's express those feelings as we sing song number 144 entitled Keep Your Eyes on the

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:07.399
Prize.

00:11:07.399 --> 00:13:18.279
That's song number 144.

00:13:18.279 --> 00:13:23.679
The Bible book of Isaiah contains many promises for the future.

00:13:23.679 --> 00:13:29.480
Do you take time to contemplate what that future will be like?

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:37.159
The following five-part symposium will help us to picture that wonderful time yet ahead.

00:13:37.159 --> 00:13:43.039
We will also learn how Jehovah is fulfilling his promise to care for his servants even

00:13:43.039 --> 00:13:45.580
now.

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:52.860
Brother Samuel Heard, a member of the governing body, will present the first talk entitled

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:56.779
Take Delight in God's promises of peace.

00:13:56.779 --> 00:14:09.019
My servants will eat, my servants will drink.

00:14:09.019 --> 00:14:14.899
In his word, Jehovah has promised to bring peace to his loyal servants.

00:14:14.899 --> 00:14:20.419
As we have learned, that peace is more than the absence of conflict.

00:14:20.419 --> 00:14:26.740
It involves our overall well-being, including our health and security.

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:34.090
God's heart-warming promises feel best with appreciation and hope.

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:42.289
In the Bible book of the 145 Psalm, it tells us in verses 15 and 16, all eyes look hopefully

00:14:42.289 --> 00:14:43.929
to you.

00:14:43.929 --> 00:14:47.529
You give them their food in a season.

00:14:47.529 --> 00:14:53.450
You open your hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing.

00:14:53.450 --> 00:15:02.049
In this symposium, we will consider the past, present, and future fulfillment of several

00:15:02.049 --> 00:15:08.330
Bible prophecies of peace that are found in the book of Isaiah.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:16.009
Jehovah promises to provide an abundance of both literal food and spiritual food.

00:15:16.009 --> 00:15:20.889
In the Israelites loyally served Jehovah, they experienced the blessings foretold at

00:15:20.889 --> 00:15:24.769
Isaiah 49-10.

00:15:24.769 --> 00:15:33.409
Today, Jehovah's servants are experiencing the fulfillment of Isaiah 65 verses 13-14.

00:15:33.409 --> 00:15:41.490
There you'll find it to say, therefore this is what the sovereign Lord Jehovah says.

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:47.649
Look, my servants will eat, but you will go hungry.

00:15:47.649 --> 00:15:53.889
Look, my servants will drink, but you will go thirsty.

00:15:53.889 --> 00:15:58.730
Look, my servants will rejoice, but you will suffer shame.

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:06.450
Look, my servants will shout joyfully because of the good condition of the heart, but you

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:15.049
will cry out because of the pain of heart, and you will well because of a broken spirit.

00:16:15.049 --> 00:16:22.490
Although we may, at times, experience literal hunger, we enjoy an abundance of satisfying

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:25.529
spiritual food.

00:16:25.529 --> 00:16:32.009
In the future, Jehovah will completely eliminate literal hunger.

00:16:32.009 --> 00:16:38.730
As you watch the following video, think about the blessings we enjoy now, and the ones

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:44.769
we will enjoy in the future.

00:16:44.769 --> 00:17:06.230
Through Isaiah, Jehovah promised to feed his servants physically and spiritually.

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:19.059
Today, Jehovah invites us to a banquet that is spiritually nourishing, Bible-based videos

00:17:19.059 --> 00:17:39.170
and publications draw us close to God, and satisfy our hunger for truth.

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:49.940
In the new world, abundant healthy food will be more than a promise.

00:17:49.940 --> 00:18:15.140
It will be a reality.

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:18.339
There will be an abundance of grain on the earth.

00:18:18.339 --> 00:18:25.720
On the top of the mountains, it will overflow.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:30.720
What a blessing it is to be among Jehovah's people.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:37.799
No provisions flow to us like an ever-broadening and ever-deepening river.

00:18:37.799 --> 00:18:41.880
There is not a grain of salt missing.

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:47.210
Not a slice of bread or a patabutter.

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:51.769
There is way too much to eat at one meal.

00:18:51.769 --> 00:18:59.049
We have to come to Jehovah's table several times a week to keep our spiritual fiber intact

00:18:59.049 --> 00:19:07.009
and energy strong for the work we engage in, the kingdom preaching.

00:19:07.009 --> 00:19:18.460
We have an abundance of nourishing food, Bible-based publications, recordings and videos, meetings

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:22.779
and conventions, website material.

00:19:22.859 --> 00:19:28.299
Jehovah has not deviated from his promise.

00:19:28.299 --> 00:19:32.460
Note this one, Psalm 72-16.

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:36.220
There will be an abundance of grain on the earth.

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:40.140
On the top of the mountains, it will overflow.

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:46.180
His fruit will flourish as in Lebanon, and in the city's people will blossom like the

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:49.819
vegetation of the earth.

00:19:49.819 --> 00:19:59.859
Then again, Isaiah 30, verse 23, and he will give the rain for the seed you sow in the

00:19:59.859 --> 00:20:08.779
ground, and the bread that the ground produces will be abundant and rich.

00:20:08.779 --> 00:20:16.089
In that day, your livestock will graze in spacious pastures.

00:20:16.089 --> 00:20:21.210
Jehovah has placed everything we need on the table.

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:27.410
We must willfully come to the table and sit down and eat.

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:33.410
He doesn't make us come, like some mothers may have to demand a reluctant child to come

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:38.890
to the house from plain and eat a meal.

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:45.329
Be sure to thank Jehovah for the spiritual food he provides.

00:20:45.329 --> 00:20:54.930
Psalm 100, verses 2 and 3, reminds us, served Jehovah with rejoicing, coming to his presence

00:20:54.930 --> 00:21:02.650
with joyful shouting, know that Jehovah is God.

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:07.089
He is the one who made us, and we belong to him.

00:21:07.089 --> 00:21:18.390
We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture, show your appreciation how by studying diligently

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:21.470
and applying what you learn.

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:29.990
If you lack sufficient material things now, take delight in meditating on future kingdom blessings.

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:35.069
Jehovah will surely fulfill his promises just as he has always done.

00:21:35.789 --> 00:21:44.509
Isaiah 55, 10 and 11, remind us, for just as the rain and the snow pour down from heaven,

00:21:45.549 --> 00:21:52.670
and do not return there until they saturate the earth, making it produce and sprout,

00:21:54.029 --> 00:21:58.029
giving seed to the sore and bread to the eater.

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:06.029
So my word that goes out of my mouth will be, it will not return to me without resolve,

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:14.829
but it will certainly accomplish whatever is my delight, and it will have sure success

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:22.829
in what I send it to do. Brother Ronald Kerzen, a helper to the teaching committee,

00:22:22.829 --> 00:22:26.349
will now present the next talk of this symposium.

00:22:27.309 --> 00:22:34.829
Take delight in God's promises of peace. They will build houses and plant vineyards.

00:22:43.599 --> 00:22:50.960
If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. This familiar saying might be true with

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:58.400
human promises, but is certainly not true with promises from Jehovah. They always come true.

00:22:59.359 --> 00:23:07.359
Just before his death, at the age of 110, Joshua reminded the Israelites why Jehovah's promises

00:23:07.359 --> 00:23:15.200
can always be trusted. He said, not one word out of all the good promises that Jehovah

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:19.839
your God has spoken to you has failed. They have all come true for you.

00:23:21.359 --> 00:23:27.839
Among all of Jehovah's good promises are the heartwarming restoration promises given to the Jews,

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:34.720
returning from exile in Babylon. Since the land of Judah had laid in desolate for 70 years,

00:23:35.359 --> 00:23:39.599
the Jews wouldn't have expected brand new homes waiting for them to occupy,

00:23:39.599 --> 00:23:45.920
or fields ready for them to harvest. There would be much work for them to do once they arrived.

00:23:47.119 --> 00:23:53.519
There were many unknowns about their future, which could have caused some to worry or be anxious.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:24:01.519
Some family heads might have wondered, where will we live? How will I feed my family and keep them safe?

00:24:02.799 --> 00:24:11.039
Jehovah calmed their hearts with the reassuring promises recorded at Isaiah 65, 21 and 22.

00:24:11.039 --> 00:24:16.079
Let's read these together. It's Isaiah 65, verses 21 and 22.

00:24:16.079 --> 00:24:24.000
And there it reads, they will build houses and live in them, and they will plant vineyards and

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:30.720
eat their fruitage. They will not build for someone else to inhabit, nor will they plant for others

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:37.759
to eat. For the days of my people will be like the days of a tree, and the work of their hands my

00:24:37.759 --> 00:24:44.720
chosen ones will enjoy to the full. These promises must have strengthened the Jews.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:49.839
How Jehovah didn't say that they might build and live in their own homes, and they

00:24:49.839 --> 00:24:57.119
might enjoy the fruitage from their own vineyards. No, he told his precious chosen ones that they

00:24:57.119 --> 00:25:04.319
will enjoy these promises to the full. Even though they hadn't been told every detail,

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:10.799
and there were many unknowns regarding their future, they knew their God, Jehovah.

00:25:11.599 --> 00:25:17.359
They knew that his promises were for their good, and that they would all come true.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:24.960
And those promises did come true. Knowing that God fulfilled all of his promises in the past,

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:31.119
strengthens our trust and confidence that all of his promises for the future,

00:25:31.119 --> 00:25:37.519
like the ones that we read in Isaiah 65, will all come true for our everlasting good.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:45.359
What a joy it will be to build and then live in our own home, never having to worry that we will

00:25:45.359 --> 00:25:53.200
lose it because of a natural disaster or economic collapse. Sadly, though, many of our brothers and

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:58.880
sisters today do suffer the harsh realities of living in this old system of things.

00:25:59.839 --> 00:26:06.559
For example, a sister in Poland named Gabriela experienced great loss when her home was nearly

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:16.029
destroyed by a flood. How did she maintain her joy? Notice what she said. I don't want to talk about

00:26:16.029 --> 00:26:23.230
what I lost. Those are just material things. Rather, I want to tell you how much I gained.

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:30.990
This experience reassured me that being a part of the Christian congregation is a unique privilege

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:37.789
as well as a source of joy and happiness. So although she went through some very difficult times,

00:26:38.109 --> 00:26:45.789
what did she gain? Joy and happiness. What about a single sister from Puerto Rico named Anel?

00:26:45.789 --> 00:26:52.269
She endured a very difficult test back in 2017 when Hurricane Maria destroyed her home.

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:57.869
As a result of that storm, she lost her job. Notice what she recalled.

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:06.589
During those difficult days, I felt anxious, but I learned to trust in Jehovah through prayer

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:14.509
and not let anxiety paralyze me. She also said, following the direction of the organization

00:27:14.509 --> 00:27:21.710
helped me to remain calm. I saw Jehovah's hand in the spiritual encouragement I received

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:27.950
as well as the material assistance provided by the Brotherhood. Jehovah gave me much more than I

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:36.269
could even ask for, and my faith was greatly strengthened. So she received assistance from Jehovah,

00:27:36.269 --> 00:27:42.029
from his organization, and she was greatly strengthened. What about you?

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:49.069
Are you suffering some sort of storm in your life, perhaps from a natural disaster,

00:27:49.069 --> 00:27:55.950
or maybe a figurative one caused by a health issue, a family problem, or some injustice?

00:27:57.309 --> 00:28:02.190
During such times, it's normal to experience feelings of anxiety,

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:09.470
worrying about our future, the safety of our family, but don't allow such feelings to paralyze you.

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:16.910
Like Gabriela and Anel, keep doing what you can and continue trusting in Jehovah.

00:28:18.269 --> 00:28:25.789
Also, continue to trust in our loving Brotherhood. Our brothers and sisters are true friends

00:28:25.869 --> 00:28:32.430
who are ready to show love in our time of distress. They will quickly come to our aid

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:39.230
by providing practical assistance and relief provisions. They will help us rebuild our home,

00:28:39.869 --> 00:28:45.869
rebuild our life. They will build us up, stabilize us with words of encouragement.

00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:53.869
When we put our complete trust in Jehovah and his promises, we received the best protection

00:28:53.869 --> 00:29:01.869
possible. Note what the Psalmist wrote at Psalm 91 verses 1 and 2. Psalm 91, 1 and 2.

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:03.630
Says,

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:09.950
Anyone dwelling in the secret place of the most high will lodge under the shadow of the Almighty.

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:18.269
I will say to Jehovah, you are my refuge and my stronghold, my God in whom I trust.

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:26.670
What a beautiful reminder of protection from Jehovah. But what is the secret place of the most high?

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:34.990
Well, it's a figurative place of spiritual security and protection. Those who dwell or lodge with God

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:43.630
as his personal guests and remain there are safe from anything or anyone that threatens their faith

00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:50.990
and their love for God. We can be sure that Jehovah will never abandon those who trust in him,

00:29:51.630 --> 00:30:00.509
not now, not ever. As you watch the following video, envision the secure future that lies ahead

00:30:00.509 --> 00:30:10.019
when we will enjoy complete security. Do you long for a home of your own?

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:18.900
Jehovah promised the returning exiles that they would build and enjoy comfortable dwellings.

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:44.299
Jehovah likewise cares for us whether we lose our home or we are taken from it. Above all,

00:30:45.099 --> 00:30:59.279
true worship provides spiritual security that is found nowhere else. The spiritual home we have now

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.680
reminds us that Jehovah will give us a physical place to call home in the new world.

00:31:33.059 --> 00:31:47.170
They will build houses and live in them. What a beautiful video. It helps us imagine

00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:54.289
what we will experience in the near future when all of God's promises become a reality on a paradise

00:31:55.250 --> 00:32:02.690
when we truly are safe, cared for in every way, physically, spiritually and emotionally.

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:11.569
Would you like to read another comforting promise from Jehovah? It's found in Isaiah chapter 65 and verse 23

00:32:12.369 --> 00:32:18.369
and there it says, they will not toil for nothing nor will they bear children for distress

00:32:19.089 --> 00:32:25.329
because they are the offspring made up of those blessed by Jehovah and their descendants with them.

00:32:26.849 --> 00:32:33.089
This must have brought great comfort to the Jews and how comforting it is for us today.

00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:41.009
In the new world, all families will experience Jehovah's blessing and enjoy the results of their

00:32:41.009 --> 00:32:49.329
hard work. In the meantime, if you have lost your home or possessions or if you experience

00:32:49.329 --> 00:32:57.009
loss in the future, keep focusing on Jehovah's good promises. Strong faith can help you to

00:32:57.009 --> 00:33:06.210
weather any storm, literal or figurative. Trust that Jehovah will hear and respond to your needs

00:33:06.289 --> 00:33:14.529
even anticipating them. He promises to open his hand and satisfy the proper desire of every living

00:33:14.529 --> 00:33:24.529
thing. That promise includes you and your family. Continue to take delight in all of God's promises,

00:33:24.529 --> 00:33:31.650
knowing that not one word out of all the good promises that Jehovah your God has spoken to you has

00:33:32.609 --> 00:33:40.769
failed. They will all come true for you. Brother Leonard Myers, a helper to the writing committee,

00:33:40.769 --> 00:33:46.769
will now present the next talk of this symposium. Take delight in God's promises of peace,

00:33:46.769 --> 00:34:00.740
the wolf and the lamb will feed together. As we continue our consideration of the promises of

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:06.339
peace in Isaiah's prophecies, I'd like you to imagine an Israelite living in Babylon.

00:34:07.299 --> 00:34:11.780
Now, he's just learned that Jews can return to Jerusalem and help to rebuild the temple.

00:34:12.739 --> 00:34:18.420
So he must decide if he and his family will leave Babylon to make the long trip to his homeland.

00:34:19.619 --> 00:34:24.739
What might he consider? Well, after 70 years, the land must have changed.

00:34:25.699 --> 00:34:31.940
Fields would be overgrown with weeds, wolves, leopards, lions, and bears must freely walk in

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:39.699
the fields. Snakes make their home there. So he might ask himself, will my domestic animals be

00:34:39.699 --> 00:34:46.420
killed by predators? Will my small children be bitten by snakes? And what about the danger of

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:53.860
fierce men attacking us on the journey home? Well, any such fears could be dispelled by considering

00:34:53.860 --> 00:35:02.019
the prophecy at Isaiah chapter 11 verses 6 through 9. Let's read that together. Isaiah chapter 11

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:10.659
and notice this promise of peace starting in verse 6. The wolf will reside for a while with the lamb

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:18.019
and with the young goat, the leopard will lie down and the calf and the lion and the fattened animal

00:35:18.099 --> 00:35:25.780
will all be together and a little boy will lead them. The cow and the bear will feed together

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:30.820
and their young will lie down together. The lion will eat straw like the bull.

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:38.420
The nursing child will play over the layer of a cobra and a wing child would put his hand over

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:45.699
the den of a poisonous snake. They will not cause any harm or any ruin in all my holy mountain

00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:52.340
because the earth will certainly be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah as the waters cover the sea.

00:35:54.099 --> 00:36:01.139
What a beautiful promise of peace! Jews wouldn't need to fear wild animals or fierce men on their

00:36:01.139 --> 00:36:08.820
journey home or in their restored land. With these poetic words, Jehovah assured the exiles that

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:15.219
they and their livestock would be safe. He would bless them with peace. And did you notice,

00:36:15.219 --> 00:36:21.780
according to verse 7, the lion would symbolically eat straw, illustrating that lions wouldn't kill

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:28.420
the Jews cattle. Faithful ones would have nothing to fear from animal or human predators.

00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:35.570
Do we see this prophecy being fulfilled in our day? Not with the literal animals,

00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:41.250
but we do see a spiritual fulfillment. Notice again the end of verse 9.

00:36:42.449 --> 00:36:46.530
It says the earth will certainly be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah.

00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:53.969
Now does the knowledge of Jehovah change the behavior of animals? No, but the knowledge of God does

00:36:53.969 --> 00:37:00.929
change people. In our day, the knowledge of Jehovah helps people who are violent to transform

00:37:00.929 --> 00:37:07.409
their personality and become peaceable. In Harmony with Colossians chapter 3 verse 10,

00:37:07.409 --> 00:37:14.130
these ones have clothed themselves with the new personality. They've stripped off animalistic

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:19.250
violent tendencies and transformed their lives in harmony with what the Bible teaches.

00:37:19.889 --> 00:37:25.809
They get along peaceably with others. Perhaps you know someone who made such changes.

00:37:26.769 --> 00:37:31.489
Or perhaps you made these changes, leaving behind a violent way of life.

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:39.889
Let me share with you such an experience. A man named Jose was trained in the martial arts

00:37:39.889 --> 00:37:45.809
and in the use of weapons. He had broken the law so many times that he was brought to trial on

00:37:45.809 --> 00:37:53.570
22 counts and sentenced to 20 years in prison. He was so violent that even fellow inmates were

00:37:53.570 --> 00:38:01.170
afraid of him and he was kept in a high security cell. For seven years his fleshly sister,

00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:06.289
who was one of Jehovah's Witnesses, visited him. But he always rejected the Bible's message.

00:38:07.969 --> 00:38:12.289
In time though, he accepted one of our publications and a Bible study was started.

00:38:13.809 --> 00:38:19.650
Right away, he made tremendous changes in his conduct. One week later, he gave a personal

00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:26.769
witness to 200 prisoners and the following week to 600 more. He even received permission to

00:38:26.769 --> 00:38:33.809
visit the inmates in other prison blocks. While due to the remarkable change in his behavior,

00:38:33.809 --> 00:38:40.849
his sentence was reduced to 15 years. However, after serving just 10 years, he was released from prison.

00:38:41.969 --> 00:38:48.610
Jose was eventually baptized as one of Jehovah's Witnesses, truly a case of the wolf

00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:55.650
residing with the lamb. And what about the future fulfillment of Isaiah chapter 11 verses 6 through 9?

00:38:57.090 --> 00:39:02.690
In the earthly paradise that God has promised, there will be delightful peace among humans

00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:07.010
and between humans and animals. Don't you long for that time?

00:39:08.849 --> 00:39:13.730
As you watch the following video, notice the peace we enjoy with fellow believers now

00:39:14.449 --> 00:39:18.690
and just imagine the peace that will enjoy in paradise.

00:39:21.619 --> 00:39:28.179
How would you feel during a long journey where you might meet wild animals and criminals

00:39:28.179 --> 00:39:35.940
along the road? Jehovah assured the returning exiles that they would return in safety

00:39:37.219 --> 00:39:43.300
and dwell in peace. In the spiritual paradise we enjoy right now,

00:39:44.179 --> 00:39:54.900
people who were once violent have learned to be humble, loving and peaceable.

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:24.400
Imagine the peace that will reign in God's new world where we can wonder this beautiful

00:40:24.400 --> 00:41:00.610
glows, explore every corner and admire the handiwork of the true God with no fear.

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:12.699
They will do no harm nor cause any ruin in all my holy mountain says Jehovah.

00:41:19.739 --> 00:41:24.300
As the video showed, people who were once violent have learned to be humble,

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:31.260
loving and peaceable. And how did you feel when you saw scenes in the video of humans so close

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:38.539
to wild animals? Jehovah's promise of peace among humans and peace between humans and animals

00:41:38.539 --> 00:41:46.699
is thrilling. Please notice what Isaiah further wrote about this peace at Isaiah chapter 65.

00:41:46.699 --> 00:41:52.539
Please turn there with me Isaiah 65. Now these are words similar to those we read earlier at Isaiah

00:41:52.539 --> 00:42:02.900
chapter 11. Isaiah 65 verse 25. The wolf and the lamb will feed together. The lion will eat

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:09.539
straw just like the bull and the serpent's food will be dust. They will do no harm

00:42:09.539 --> 00:42:18.349
nor cause any ruin in all my holy mountain says Jehovah, skilled artists in the art department

00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:23.869
at world headquarters beautifully illustrate such scenes and the images can be found in our publications.

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:30.429
But what Isaiah describes is no artist's rendition. This will be real.

00:42:31.789 --> 00:42:37.230
Think how you'll feel when you're not afraid of wild animals and the animals aren't afraid of you.

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:45.599
As we look forward to that future promise of peace, what can we do now to pursue peace?

00:42:47.119 --> 00:42:52.960
One thing is to contribute to the peace of our spiritual paradise, the secure,

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:56.559
spiritually prosperous environment in which we worship Jehovah.

00:42:58.239 --> 00:43:03.360
Jesus stated at Matthew chapter 5 verse 9, happy are the peacemakers.

00:43:04.079 --> 00:43:09.360
A peacemaker is skilled at restoring peace among brothers when peace is disturbed.

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:15.599
But more importantly, a peacemaker strives to avoid disturbing peace in the first place.

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:23.599
Does peacemaker describe you? Are you contributing to our spiritual paradise in that way?

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:30.380
Something else we can do as we await the future fulfillment of the wolf and the lamb feeding

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:37.820
together is to meditate on what it will be like to help resurrected ones who were violent to become

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:43.179
peaceable. Imagine studying with a resurrected one who had a violent background,

00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:47.659
perhaps experiencing a violent death because of a fierce personality.

00:43:49.179 --> 00:43:54.460
How will you reason with the person from God's word to help him see the need to be a peacemaker?

00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:58.780
What examples of such transformations will you share?

00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:05.900
And how will you explain the prophecies of peace at Isaiah chapter 11 verses 6 through 9 and

00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:15.980
chapter 65 verse 25? We encourage all of you to think deeply about how this promise of peace was

00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:22.059
fulfilled for the ancient Jews, how the promise is being fulfilled today, and what life on earth

00:44:22.059 --> 00:44:29.659
will be like when it's fulfilled in the future. May all of us take delight in the peaceful promise

00:44:29.659 --> 00:44:38.349
of the wolf and the lamb feeding together. Where the James Mance, a helper to the writing committee,

00:44:38.349 --> 00:44:44.349
will now present the next talk of this symposium. Take delight in God's promises of peace.

00:44:44.429 --> 00:45:01.820
No resident will say, I am sick. Jehovah is the great healer. Only he can make the promise,

00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:10.219
no resident will say, I am sick. Why can we be confident that Jehovah is going to keep his promise

00:45:10.219 --> 00:45:18.940
to bring an end to all sickness? We find assurance in the words of Isaiah chapter 35 verses 5 and 6.

00:45:19.659 --> 00:45:25.420
Please open your Bibles to that scripture. Here we read a promise of healing that Jehovah made

00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:32.460
to the nation of Israel. This promise gives us hope because it was actually fulfilled on a small

00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:41.099
scale more than 2,500 years ago. Isaiah chapter 35 verses 5 and 6 reads,

00:45:41.179 --> 00:45:48.860
At that time, the eyes of the blind will be opened, and the ears of the deaf will be unstopped.

00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:55.739
At that time, the lame will leap like the deer, and the tongue of the speechless will shout for joy.

00:45:55.739 --> 00:46:01.739
For waters will burst forth in the wilderness, and streams in the desert plain.

00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:10.539
Isaiah recorded this promise, 125 years before the Babylonian army destroyed Jerusalem.

00:46:10.539 --> 00:46:18.219
It was fulfilled after Jehovah freed the Israelites from Babylonian captivity in 537 BCE,

00:46:18.219 --> 00:46:27.179
and restored them to their homeland in Israel. But you may ask, were the blind, deaf, lame,

00:46:27.739 --> 00:46:35.420
and speechless really healed at that time? To answer, we need to apply a basic principle.

00:46:36.139 --> 00:46:44.699
Jehovah restores what was lost. During the 70 years of exile, Jehovah did not punish the Israelites

00:46:44.699 --> 00:46:50.460
by striking them with physical blindness, deafness, lameness, and loss of speech.

00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:57.900
Therefore, their restoration would not require the healing of their physical disabilities.

00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:06.699
However, these afflictions are a good description of the self-inflicted spiritual sickness

00:47:06.699 --> 00:47:11.820
that had caused the nation to fall into apostasy and lose Jehovah's favor.

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:19.739
Jehovah saw their repentant attitude, and their desire to restore true worship in Jerusalem.

00:47:20.539 --> 00:47:27.260
He healed their spiritual sickness by forgiving their sins and restoring them to his favor.

00:47:28.699 --> 00:47:35.739
In other words, they came to their spiritual senses. They regained their spiritual vision,

00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:44.460
and their ability to hear, obey, and speak Jehovah's word. No longer spiritually lame,

00:47:45.099 --> 00:47:54.429
they were energized to carry on Jehovah's pure worship. Similarly today, we are eyewitnesses.

00:47:54.429 --> 00:48:00.269
Yes, we are the beneficiaries of a worldwide spiritual healing program.

00:48:01.469 --> 00:48:07.550
Jehovah heals us spiritually by freeing us from false religious teachings and unclean practices.

00:48:08.269 --> 00:48:15.550
He has brought us into a spiritual paradise where our spiritual strength is renewed day by day.

00:48:16.989 --> 00:48:24.030
In a spiritual sense, the blind are learning to see, and the deaf are learning to hear.

00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:30.750
But is spiritual healing the only part of the fulfillment of Jehovah's promise?

00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:37.550
No. Please open your Bibles to Isaiah chapter 33 and verse 24.

00:48:38.349 --> 00:48:44.670
As we read this verse, pay attention to the latter part because it contains the key

00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:51.710
to understanding why physical healing is included in God's promise, no resident will say,

00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:57.230
I am sick. Isaiah chapter 33 verse 24 says,

00:48:57.949 --> 00:49:05.869
and no resident will say, I am sick, the people dwelling in the land will be pardoned for their error.

00:49:07.789 --> 00:49:13.949
Did you notice that the end of sickness is related to our being pardoned for our errors,

00:49:13.949 --> 00:49:19.789
or sins? Clearly, that ties the fulfillment to a spiritual healing.

00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:27.949
However, our imperfect sinful condition is also the reason that we get physically sick.

00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:36.030
Therefore, in the new world, on the basis of the healing power of Jesus' ransom sacrifice,

00:49:36.590 --> 00:49:40.030
we will experience a healing of our physical sicknesses.

00:49:40.989 --> 00:49:49.150
Jehovah's promise that no resident will say, I am sick, will come true in the complete sense.

00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:56.929
As you watch the following video, think about the spiritual blessings we enjoy now,

00:49:57.650 --> 00:50:04.929
and imagine what our lives will be like in the future when all our physical ailments will be healed.

00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:11.500
Clear instruction from Jehovah.

00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:13.500
Jehovah.

00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:20.860
Draws us close to him and maintains spiritual health.

00:50:24.739 --> 00:50:28.739
While false teachings hold many in the grip of spiritual darkness,

00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:53.219
Jehovah offers true freedom. The spiritual health we enjoy now

00:50:55.820 --> 00:51:09.579
reminds us that perfect physical and mental health await us in paradise.

00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:33.599
Imagine waking every day, feeling clean, healthy, happy,

00:51:35.599 --> 00:51:58.139
and full of the joy of life. Jehovah promises, no resident will say, I am sick.

00:52:04.989 --> 00:52:10.989
How refreshing and heartwarming to think of the global healing that lies ahead.

00:52:11.869 --> 00:52:18.429
We are confident that this is going to happen. Why? Because we have already experienced

00:52:18.429 --> 00:52:25.309
how Jehovah has healed us spiritually. Keep in mind the powerful statement from the video.

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:34.590
The spiritual health we enjoy now reminds us that perfect physical and mental health await us

00:52:34.590 --> 00:52:42.670
in paradise. We also learned from the video that clear instruction from Jehovah draws us close to

00:52:42.670 --> 00:52:50.989
him and helps us to maintain our spiritual health today. What a blessing it is to be taught

00:52:50.989 --> 00:52:59.070
by Jehovah. We can show our appreciation for this spiritual healing by thanking Jehovah in prayer.

00:52:59.949 --> 00:53:07.710
Psalm 40. Verse 5 mentions another way we can thank the great healer for all he has done and will do

00:53:07.710 --> 00:53:16.510
for us. Let's read it. Psalm 40 and verse 5 says, How many things you have done, O Jehovah,

00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:24.269
my God? Your wonderful works and your thoughts toward us, none can compare to you. If I were to

00:53:24.269 --> 00:53:33.489
try to tell and speak of them, they would be too numerous to recount. Our gratitude to Jehovah

00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:41.409
will move us to tell others about Jehovah's wonderful works, to speak of the many things he has

00:53:41.409 --> 00:53:50.369
done. And we will never run out of good things to say about our God. Those who respond favorably

00:53:50.369 --> 00:53:56.849
will come to know Jehovah as their great healer and enjoy his friendship forever.

00:53:57.809 --> 00:54:05.250
Granted, today many of us are dealing with serious health challenges, but we do what we can to share

00:54:05.250 --> 00:54:13.329
with others this good news about healing. And we take delight in Jehovah's promises which cannot fail.

00:54:14.769 --> 00:54:21.170
When Jesus was on earth, no sickness was beyond his ability to heal, whether it was physical,

00:54:21.809 --> 00:54:29.730
mental or emotional. In the new world, such healings will take place on a much grander scale,

00:54:30.610 --> 00:54:38.769
and the cures will be permanent. Many of the great crowd will go through the great tribulation

00:54:38.769 --> 00:54:46.289
with serious debilitating illnesses. Our publications have said that it seems reasonable to expect

00:54:46.289 --> 00:54:52.530
that shortly after the destruction of Satan's system of things, miracles like those that Jesus

00:54:52.530 --> 00:55:00.769
performed while on earth will no doubt take place on a global scale. That will allow all survivors

00:55:00.769 --> 00:55:08.130
of the great tribulation to have a satisfying share in transforming this earth into a beautiful

00:55:08.130 --> 00:55:15.489
paradise. And by the end of Jesus' thousand year reign, they will reach the very fullness of

00:55:15.489 --> 00:55:22.849
perfect human life. As we enjoy the rich blessings of our spiritual paradise now,

00:55:23.489 --> 00:55:29.570
let's keep in mind that these spiritual blessings are evidence that all the promises of the great

00:55:29.570 --> 00:55:36.690
healer will come true. We will forever take delight in the complete fulfillment of Jehovah's promise

00:55:37.329 --> 00:55:46.449
that no resident will say, I am sick. Brother Garrett Lush, a member of the governing body,

00:55:46.449 --> 00:55:53.570
will now present the final talk of this symposium. Take delight in God's promises of peace.

00:55:54.289 --> 00:56:09.659
He will swallow up death forever. How wonderful and impressive to realize that

00:56:09.739 --> 00:56:16.300
Jehovah promises to raise people from the dead and to end death permanently.

00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:24.460
I invite you to read with me that comforting promise found that I say a chapter 25.

00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:35.820
Regarding our God, Jehovah, I say a 25, 7 and 8 says, he will do away with a shroud that is

00:56:35.820 --> 00:56:43.260
enveloping all the peoples and the covering that is woven over all the nations. He will swallow

00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:50.699
up death forever and the sovereign Lord Jehovah will wipe away the tears from all faces.

00:56:52.139 --> 00:57:03.739
The watchtower of September 15, 2014, page 25 said, fittingly, the Bible refers to inherited sin

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:12.780
and death as the shroud that is enveloping all the peoples and the covering that is woven over all

00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:22.460
the nations. This suffocating covering or shroud, this intricate web work of condemnation

00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:31.739
entrapes all people. But how do we know that Jehovah can resurrect the dead? Because he already

00:57:31.739 --> 00:57:41.340
brought his people back to life figuratively in the past. In 537 before our common era,

00:57:41.340 --> 00:57:48.460
Jehovah in effect raised the nation of Israel from the dead, restoring the people who were held

00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:55.659
captive in Babylon for 70 years to their homeland and reestablishing pure worship.

00:57:55.820 --> 00:58:05.340
In 1919, Jehovah freed his modern day people from Babylon the Great, the world empire

00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:15.179
false religion, revitalizing them for renewed activity. I say a 26, 19 prophesied this,

00:58:16.139 --> 00:58:25.980
your dead will live, my corpses will rise up. A wake and shout joyfully, you will residence in

00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:33.420
the dust, for your dew is as the dew of the morning, and the earth will let those powerless in death

00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:42.059
come to life. When were God's people held captive by Babylon the Great? That spiritual captivity

00:58:42.059 --> 00:58:50.619
lasted from the second century of our common era to 1919 when anointed Christians were gathered

00:58:50.619 --> 00:58:58.539
into the restored congregation. God's people were tested and refined during the years following

00:58:58.539 --> 00:59:08.300
the establishment of God's kingdom in the heavens in 1914. Then in 1919 Jesus appointed

00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:14.860
the faithful and discreet slave over God's cleansed people to give them spiritual food at the

00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:23.099
proper time. This was the year that God's people started to return to their God-given spiritual

00:59:23.099 --> 00:59:31.019
estate. It was also the time when they were released from symbolic captivity to Babylon the Great.

00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:39.739
How happy we can be though that after God's people experienced centuries of spiritual oppression,

00:59:39.739 --> 00:59:46.139
we as God's people not only experienced a spiritual restoration and a spiritual paradise,

00:59:46.139 --> 00:59:54.300
but will see the fulfillment of Isaiah 25 verse 8 when God swallows up death forever.

00:59:55.260 --> 01:00:02.219
Yes, Jehovah will end death forever, what a thrilling promise of peace.

01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:10.219
Who of us has not lost the loved one to some disease, perhaps even from COVID-19,

01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:17.179
or an accident or a disaster? God here promises that death will be no more,

01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:23.900
which suggests that the children who might be born then will not have to face the prospect of

01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:33.420
growing up and then getting old, ending in death. In addition to Isaiah's prophecy, Revelation 21

01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:41.260
4 clearly states a similar thought. There we read that death will be no more.

01:00:42.619 --> 01:00:50.139
As you watch the following video, think about what Jehovah has already done to show his love for us

01:00:50.219 --> 01:00:58.800
and what he will do for us in the future. Jehovah fulfilled his word to the exiles.

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:12.179
He restored that ruin nation as if bringing it back to life. In 1919,

01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:21.409
Jehovah did something similar. He released his modern-day people from spiritual captivity

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:36.500
and energized them to preach. Just as Jehovah raised his people from figurative death,

01:01:37.539 --> 01:02:08.420
so will he reverse the effects of literal death? Indeed, God will swallow up death forever.

01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:40.000
Imagine living longer than any tree, cause death will be no more.

01:02:47.789 --> 01:02:54.909
How we delight in the many things Jehovah gives us. Today we are privileged to be among the

01:02:54.909 --> 01:03:03.070
only group of people who worship Jehovah in the elevated way that he approves as prophesied in

01:03:03.070 --> 01:03:12.670
Isaiah chapter 2 verse 2. And think about the overwhelming joy we will feel when Jehovah resurrects

01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:19.070
our loved ones. Thank you, Jehovah, for our precious resurrection hope.

01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:24.510
First Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13 says,

01:03:25.789 --> 01:03:31.630
moreover, brothers, we do not want you to be ignorant about those who are sleeping in death

01:03:32.269 --> 01:03:36.989
so that you may not sorrow as the rest do who have no hope.

01:03:37.710 --> 01:03:46.190
Meditate on it to strengthen your faith and courage. Why is it important for us to do so?

01:03:47.230 --> 01:03:54.590
Because the threat of death is a powerful weapon. Those under Satan's control use it to force

01:03:54.590 --> 01:04:02.349
people to betray their friends or to give up their convictions. But that threat is powerless

01:04:02.429 --> 01:04:12.269
against us. We know that if our enemies kill us, Jehovah will restore us to life. We are convinced

01:04:12.269 --> 01:04:22.829
that nothing they can do can sever our attachment to Jehovah. What remarkable wisdom Jehovah has

01:04:22.829 --> 01:04:30.590
shown by giving us the resurrection hope. By means of it, he disarmed Satan of one of his most

01:04:30.590 --> 01:04:39.949
effective weapons and at the same time arms us with unbreakable courage. Remember that death is

01:04:39.949 --> 01:04:50.880
temporary and that the life Jehovah offers each of us will last forever. In this symposium,

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:58.400
we have learned how Jehovah fulfilled his promises in the past, how he is fulfilling them today,

01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:05.840
and how he will fulfill them in the future. As we have seen, God's promises of peace

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:17.280
include one, nutritious spiritual and physical food for all, two, adequate housing and satisfying work,

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:31.440
three, freedom from the risk of violence, four, perfect physical health, and five, the elimination

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:42.300
of death. With Jehovah's our God and best friend, we will delight in the abundance of peace forever.

01:05:44.449 --> 01:05:51.650
Thank you, brothers. Few things bring more joy to our heart than meditating on what Jehovah is

01:05:51.650 --> 01:05:59.489
doing for us now and what he will do in the near future. We have so many rich blessings to look

01:05:59.489 --> 01:06:08.579
forward to. How fitting it is that we keep our focus on pleasing our loving Heavenly Father.

01:06:08.579 --> 01:06:19.219
Thus we invite you to sing song number 35 entitled, Make sure the more important things, song number 35.
