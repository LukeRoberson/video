00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.530
Philippians chapter 2 and verse 3,

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.830
with humility, consider others superior to you.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.269
These words penned by the Apostle Paul

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.470
really reflect a message that Jesus tried again and again

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.070
to get across to his apostles.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.989
In fact, let's look at one account in Mark chapter 10,

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:25.699
verse 42 and 43.

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.199
Mark chapter 10, verses 42.

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.100
It says, but Jesus called them to him and said to them,

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.100
you know that those who appear to be ruling the nations

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.539
lorded over them, and their great ones

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:41.060
wheeled authority over them.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.020
This must not be the way among you,

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.460
but whoever wants to be great among you

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.820
must be your minister.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.939
And with humility, consider others superior to you.

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:55.020
Now, why was Jesus so concerned

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.020
that his disciples learned this lesson of humility?

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.820
Because Jesus knew that lack of humility is contrary

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.260
to Jehovah's personality.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.620
If we don't have humility, Jehovah's Holy Spirit

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.659
cannot flow.

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.939
Psalm 138, in verse 1, says that Jehovah only knows

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.859
the haughty from a distance.

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:18.140
But Jesus also knew that lack of humility

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.180
disrupts the peace of God's people.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.739
And without peace, Jehovah's Spirit cannot flow either.

00:01:24.739 --> 00:01:27.180
We may think of first Corinthians 14 and 33.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.140
This is Jehovah is a God of peace.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.099
Now, it's adventurous as we look at the accounts

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:36.540
that Jesus recognized that when his disciples

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.099
lost their peace, when they were arguing,

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:41.900
when they were bickering among themselves,

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.379
it was because they were not applying the principle

00:01:44.379 --> 00:01:46.140
in today's text.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.219
Let's look at another account.

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:50.379
If you look back a page to Mark chapter nine

00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:57.500
in verse 33, it says, and they came into cavernium.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.180
Now, when he was inside the house,

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.260
he put the questions to them,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.980
what were you arguing about on the road?

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.739
What were you arguing about?

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:07.620
Well, you look at verse 35, they were quiet

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.099
because they were arguing about who was greater.

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.259
Now, you think about this.

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:14.539
These were grown men.

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:16.620
Do you really think they were walking down the road

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.780
saying, well, I'm greater than you are?

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.460
No, I'm the greatest there is, maybe, but maybe not.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.259
These were grown mature men.

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:26.979
But Jesus, in his wisdom of human nature,

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:30.539
being able to read hearts knew what they were arguing

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:33.099
about, the root of it, the topic didn't matter.

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.139
The real issue was that it was a lack of humility.

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:39.979
And notice what he says in verse 35.

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:43.300
It says, so we said, now call the 12 and said to them,

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.460
if anyone wants to be first,

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.580
he must be last of all and minister of all.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.780
Have humility.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.259
Consider others superior to you.

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:58.539
At Luke 9, verse 46 and 47, when there was a dispute,

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:01.219
that account says, Jesus, knowing the reasoning

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:04.860
of their hearts, counseled them on humility.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.860
He saw right through the argument, right through the issue,

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.979
and isolated the real problem, lack of humility.

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:13.539
Now, when you think about it, isn't it true

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:17.539
that that's usually what is behind petty arguments,

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:20.500
disputes, disagreements we may have?

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.379
See, if Jesus was among us, would he say,

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.460
what were you arguing about in the office?

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.020
What were you arguing about in the room?

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.379
See, whether it's between marriage mates,

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.460
those of us working together here at Bethel,

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.699
bodies of elders, publishers in the congregation,

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:39.219
what's the lesson for us?

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:41.259
Well, the lesson is that when there seems

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:45.020
to be a lack of peace, when there seems to be tension

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.580
or arguing, the first person we should look at is ourselves.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.620
Am I really arguing over who is greater?

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.979
Now, an account that always comes to mind

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:57.300
when I think about this is that of Hagar,

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.900
Sarah's Egyptian made servant.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.500
If you turn back to Genesis chapter 16

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.659
and we're familiar with this account, Sarah,

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:08.219
or Sarah at the time, was not able to become pregnant,

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:11.860
Hagar became pregnant, and as soon as Hagar became pregnant,

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.699
peace went out of the family, there was tension,

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:15.340
there was bickering, there was arguing,

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.819
things escalated to the point of Sarah

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.459
humiliating Hagar and chasing her away into the wilderness.

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.819
Now, we may first read this and go, poor Hagar,

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:26.459
this young pregnant girl, Sarah is just jealous,

00:04:26.459 --> 00:04:30.740
Sarah is got the problem, was at the case.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.259
Well, we don't have all the facts of the matter,

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:35.019
but it is adventurous to know what Jehovah through his angel

00:04:35.019 --> 00:04:38.019
told Hagar when he met up with her in the wilderness.

00:04:38.019 --> 00:04:41.300
Look at Genesis chapter 16 and verse 9.

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:45.660
It says, Jehovah's angel then said to her,

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.660
return to your mistress and humble yourself under her hand.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.100
Go back and be humble and everything will be okay.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.060
Now, do you notice what may have been the obstacle to peace?

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.420
Back in verse 4, chapter 16 verse 4,

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.620
it says that Hagar began to despise her mistress

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.220
when she Hagar found out that she was pregnant.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.100
A Bianton's translation says that Hagar began to look down

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.860
on her mistress, Hagar began to feel that she was superior.

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:16.060
And what happened?

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.620
Yes, Hagar chased her away.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.379
Hagar reacted, and perhaps Sarah reacted,

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:22.699
perhaps Sarah did not react well either.

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:25.660
But do you notice who Jehovah held responsible

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.100
for the lack of peace in the family?

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:33.060
Hagar, you go back and humble yourself under her hand.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.899
And see, that's a good account that reminds us

00:05:34.899 --> 00:05:39.060
as sometimes the real underlying challenge to peace

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.379
may be me.

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:41.819
See, peace may have gone away

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:43.779
because how people are reacting to me,

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:46.500
perhaps I'm telegraphing that I think my ways,

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.379
my ideas, my way of doing things are superior to others.

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:53.699
Now, why is this so important that we fight this imperfect

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:56.420
tendency that we all have toward pride,

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:01.259
toward lacking humility, fearlings of superiority?

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:03.860
Well, not only is it distasteful to Jehovah,

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.180
but as we've talked about, lack of humility

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.459
disrupts the peace of God's people.

00:06:10.459 --> 00:06:14.620
And without peace, Jehovah's spirit cannot flow.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.939
And without Jehovah's spirit, we're on our own.

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:21.180
And if we're on our own, we're going to fail.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.500
There's a powerful quote in the Kingdom Rules book

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.060
on page 120 in paragraph 9.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.899
In fact, we have a written on one of the whiteboards

00:06:27.899 --> 00:06:31.300
in our office just to remind us of this point.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.019
It says this.

00:06:33.019 --> 00:06:36.180
It says, any structure of order that does not have peace

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:41.019
as its foundation will sooner or later collapse.

00:06:41.019 --> 00:06:44.339
In contrast, Godly peace promotes the kind of order

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:46.019
that lasts.

00:06:46.019 --> 00:06:47.620
Powerful point, isn't that?

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.019
Any structure of order that does not

00:06:50.019 --> 00:06:55.660
have peace as its foundation will sooner or later collapse.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.019
And see, that applies in the congregation

00:06:58.019 --> 00:07:02.699
and a family in our department at Bethel on a construction site

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:04.620
wherever we are.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.939
And I know in our work, no matter how challenging,

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:10.699
how complicated things get, no matter what we're dealing with,

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:13.420
the only time we really start to worry

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.139
is when we find that peace has gone away.

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:17.500
Maybe this tension between ones in the office,

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.379
and maybe this tension between our department

00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:21.620
and another department, that's when we worry.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.500
And we start working quickly to see what can we do

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.779
to restore peace.

00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:27.819
Because when peace is present, no matter how challenging,

00:07:27.819 --> 00:07:30.220
how hard the topic is, it's just work.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:30.980
And that's why we're here.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.540
We love to work.

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:36.860
But when peace is disturbed, that's when we're in trouble.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.379
Now, how important is it to Jehovah

00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:41.220
that we consider other superior to us?

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.819
How important is it to Jehovah that we maintain peace?

00:07:44.819 --> 00:07:47.019
How does he feel about that?

00:07:47.019 --> 00:07:53.959
Let's look at description in Psalm 35 and verse 27.

00:07:53.959 --> 00:07:59.129
Psalm 35 and verse 27.

00:07:59.129 --> 00:08:01.529
It says, but let those who take pleasure

00:08:01.529 --> 00:08:04.730
in my righteousness shall joyfully.

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:09.050
May they constantly say, may Jehovah be magnified

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:13.689
who takes pleasure in the peace of his servant?

00:08:13.689 --> 00:08:17.569
Jehovah takes pleasure in the peace of his servant.

00:08:17.569 --> 00:08:20.730
He takes pleasure when he sees us working together

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:26.009
in unity, in peace, and that takes humility.

00:08:26.009 --> 00:08:28.769
So may we work hard to always apply

00:08:28.769 --> 00:08:31.569
the principle in today's text.

00:08:31.569 --> 00:08:34.490
Consider others superior to us.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:38.090
May we work hard to maintain the peace of all of us,

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:38.970
all that around us.

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:42.809
And may Jehovah never have to say of us,

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:45.570
what were you arguing about on the road?
