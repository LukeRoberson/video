00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.730
Why does God allow suffering?

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.730
Jehovah God didn't intend for humans to suffer.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.730
On the contrary,

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.730
He gave the first human couple a wonderful start,

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.090
with Satan, a rebel angel,

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.090
called God a liar,

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.090
and influenced the first humans to reject God's authority.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.090
When Adam and Eve disobeyed God,

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.090
they chose to follow Satan.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.090
They rebelled against Jehovah,

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.259
and decided for themselves what was right and wrong.

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:59.259
Was Satan correct?

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:04.260
Court humans ruled themselves successfully without help from God?

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.260
Time would be needed to settle the crucial issues raised by the rebels.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
To illustrate,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
a rebellious student claims

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
that the teacher's method of instruction is wrong.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.260
He insists that he knows a much better way.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
Some students think that he is right,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.769
and they also become rebellious.

00:01:30.769 --> 00:01:34.299
What should the teacher do?

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.299
He has the authority to reprimand the rebellious students,

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.299
but what effect would that choice have on the other students?

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.299
They may lose respect for the teacher,

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.299
thinking that he is afraid of being proved wrong.

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.299
But suppose the teacher allows the student to show the class his method.

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.299
Then it would be proved to all present

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:08.139
who is qualified to teach.

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:12.139
Jehovah has done something similar to what the teacher does.

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:15.139
When Satan challenged Jehovah,

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:18.139
millions of angels were watching.

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:20.139
How Jehovah handled the rebellion

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:23.139
would greatly affect all those angels,

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:27.139
and eventually all intelligent creation.

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:33.139
Knowing this, Jehovah allows Satan to rule this world for a time.

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:38.139
Satan's rule has caused untold pain and suffering.

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:44.139
However, once Jehovah's right and ability to rule is established beyond any doubt,

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:51.139
Jehovah will undo all the damage caused by Satan's rebellion.

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:58.139
At that time, only people who choose to follow God's standards will inhabit the earth.
