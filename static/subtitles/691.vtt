00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:16.940
Nigeria is by far the most populous nation in Africa with over 200 million inhabitants.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:25.920
Over 389,000 kingdom publishers are giving a witness to Jehovah's name in this country.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.600
The branch office is in Igiduma, where approximately 570 full-time members care for the work,

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.320
along with an additional 100 working on the renovation of the branch.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.359
We wonder, what would we come to love about the friends in Nigeria?

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:46.960
What beautiful qualities would stand out?

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.759
Well, many could be mentioned, but we were especially touched by the joy they display

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:56.280
despite challenges.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.359
Our brothers remain joyful because their focus is on future kingdom realities, not on the

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:04.640
present unfavorable conditions.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.719
In the month of September and October, a number of states experienced severe flooding.

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:16.480
Even with us unwelcome challenge, the brothers ensured that they would not miss the spiritual

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:23.120
food, thus they had the watchtower study in a canoe over flooded areas, joyfully attending

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.400
and commenting despite obstacles.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.719
Even though many had to leave their homes, they still had joy.

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:38.799
Not because of their lives being turned upside down, but joyful because they were not alone.

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:44.159
Joyful because they knew they had a supportive brotherhood behind them, and they knew the

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.439
real solution is soon to come.

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:54.519
How encouraging to see the friends joy despite the hardship that natural disasters bring.

00:01:54.519 --> 00:02:00.280
We also see this quality shine through when the brothers endure other hardships.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.599
The Rousseau Otozo endured persecution when he took a neutral stand involving a conflict

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:08.800
with the neighboring village.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.039
But I explained to them from the scripture, my conscience would not allow me to support

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:20.879
and that would offend you, and they flogged me, tied me, and that led to my banishment

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.080
from the community.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:30.199
I did not have any plan of where I would stay, when the brothers they welcomed me, the encouraged

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:33.280
me, the supported me in various ways.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:41.520
I received several shepherds in call, it showed me that Jehovah took note of me personally.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.879
He cares about me.

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:50.599
Brother Otozo continues to find joy in his ministry in spite of these challenges.

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:59.159
Next, note the example of a sister who is able to maintain her joy despite physical limitations.

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:05.199
Sister Ruki Pararo suddenly lost her eyesight when she was 23 years old.

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:09.000
Around that time, she came into contact with the truth.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.680
Listen to what impressed her at her first meeting with Jehovah's people.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.120
Notice too how her zeal and the ministry affects her joy.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.439
For blind people, we normally feel insecure, especially to those who are not used to.

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:33.120
But in my very first meeting, I felt the love, you know, I sense the joy, no need to be

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.719
so free with me, the love, they hold me, so I was touched with the love because I felt

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:40.719
special.

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:46.520
When I first lost my sight, I told I was useless.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:54.159
Now, I am useless because now I can see I can use my life to self-jehovah and I can go outside

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:56.840
to talk to people and make myself useless.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.599
So this gives me joy and it makes me so love Jehovah and self-jehovah the more.

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:09.879
Without a doubt, God's people in Nigeria are making the joy of Jehovah their stronghold.

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:15.379
And that left an indelible mark on our hearts.

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:19.379
Our next stop was the neighboring country of Cameroon.

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:25.339
Cameroon is often referred to as Africa in miniature because of its geographical and cultural

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:27.060
diversity.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.500
Over 50,000 publishers are preaching the good news in this branch territory, which includes

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.899
Equatorial Guinea and Gabon.

00:04:35.899 --> 00:04:43.139
The branch office is located in Duwala, where about 70 full-time workers care for the work.

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:47.300
We wondered the same about Jehovah's people in Cameroon.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.699
What would we come to love about them?

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:52.420
What beautiful qualities would stand out?

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.339
Well, it is difficult to narrow it to just one.

00:04:56.339 --> 00:05:03.379
But we could say that a quality that stood out plainly was their zeal in serving Jehovah.

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:09.100
The brothers and sisters just love to preach and conduct Bible studies.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.779
This can be seen among the Bethelites.

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:16.339
Right outside the Bethel Gate, we set up a literature cart.

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:23.860
Early mornings before work, evenings after work, and on weekends, Bethelites man the cart.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.699
We have had wonderful conversations, and several Bible studies have been started.

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:35.699
Also, every year preaching campaigns are organized by the branch to cover seldom worked and

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:40.939
unassigned territories all over the branch territory.

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:46.220
The purpose of brothers and sisters answer this call, including many young ones.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.899
For many of the friends, it is their yearly vacation.

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:55.500
I love participating in campaigns because they are a great opportunity to express one's

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.740
faith in Jehovah in a remarkable way.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.019
We almost never know what awaits us in the territory where we are going.

00:06:03.019 --> 00:06:07.699
However, we always see how Jehovah supports us.

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:13.860
During campaigns, we cover long distances to preach, and sometimes we return exhausted.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.939
But surprisingly, the next day we are up early and ready to go and preach farther than

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:20.500
the previous day.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.019
This is proof that it is Jehovah who gives us strength.

00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:29.860
I am determined to participate in all campaigns until the preaching work stops.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:35.180
When participating in these preaching campaigns, their friends are finding great interest

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.420
in the truth.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:43.379
In visiting publishers in a remote area, Brother Dave Momall learned of Mr. Nicholas, an

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:47.339
interested man in a nearby village.

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:53.649
Mr. Nicholas studied the Bible with a number of people in his village.

00:06:53.649 --> 00:06:59.370
So we asked Mr. Nicholas how he got the publications and how he learned to conduct a watchtower

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.769
study.

00:07:02.769 --> 00:07:08.089
Mr. Nicholas explained to us that Mr. Clement came every two months.

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:13.290
He was the one who brought him the publications, and he was the one who taught him how to organize

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.410
Christian meetings.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.930
We traveled to the next village to meet Mr. Clement.

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:24.329
When we arrived, we found that Mr. Clement was also preaching in his village, and he had

00:07:24.329 --> 00:07:28.259
even built a place of worship.

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:33.220
Although these men were not yet Jehovah's Witnesses, they were already preaching in remote

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.540
villages.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:40.310
A special pioneer was sent to follow up on the interest.

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:49.980
When we arrived in Mr. Clement's village, interested ones came to visit us immediately.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:08:01.540
We began to conduct Bible studies that afternoon, and played videos into the night.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:07.180
The next day, we visited Mr. Nicholas in his village.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:12.259
Those interested in the good news insisted that we meet with the chief with the hope that

00:08:12.259 --> 00:08:16.420
he would give us land to build a kingdom hall.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.899
To our surprise, the chief agreed.

00:08:20.899 --> 00:08:29.389
Now Mr. Clement is baptized and Mr. Nicholas is progressing towards baptism.

00:08:29.389 --> 00:08:36.389
Much more could be said about the beautiful spiritual qualities these friends exhibit.

00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:42.149
But the joy we found in Nigeria and the zeal of the friends in Cameroon are two of the

00:08:42.149 --> 00:08:47.870
qualities that touched our hearts and endeared the friends to us.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:53.309
It was a privilege to serve them and to see how Jehovah is using these faithful servants

00:08:53.309 --> 00:08:56.549
to care for his kingdom work in this part of the world.
