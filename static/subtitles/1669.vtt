00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.610
This story is about brother Atah Yaldiko.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:10.210
He is an Assyrian man from Iraq and was raised as a Christian.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.410
Atah's childhood friend had noticed that Atah had a thirst for the truth.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.410
But because of the political situation in Iraq,

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.809
the two friends got separated and moved to different countries in Europe.

00:00:22.809 --> 00:00:25.809
But was the geographical distance a problem?

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:29.010
No. This is their story.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:42.960
I was about 18 years old when one of my friends named Ziyad asked me,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.399
Atah, have you read the Bible?

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.399
We started to read the Bible from Genesis.

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.200
I remember one time when we read the sermon on the Mount.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.200
We decided to go up to the mountain to read.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:06.980
Our hometown, Aglotch, has many mountains.

00:01:07.379 --> 00:01:11.980
In June 1998, I was in an accident.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.780
In this accident, I lost both my legs.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.780
It was a difficult time because I was so young.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.579
I was 22 years old, so it was very hard.

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:36.180
I remember I was the time in Holland and I hear the news from family, from Iraq.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:44.030
And I went somewhere alone and I started to cry.

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.430
I came to Sweden and like many refugees,

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.030
I had no desire to leave Iraq.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.829
I was talking to Ziyad all the time.

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.430
And one day in 2006 he called me and told me

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.030
that he was studying with Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.030
So I said to him,

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:18.030
is it logical that two billion Christians are wrong and that you are right?

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.030
And after a few months I told him also that I'm going to be baptized.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.030
When he said that,

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.030
I thought I was going to get a heart attack.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.030
And he tried to convince me that

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.030
it is not that wrong, that it is maybe a big mistake

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.030
what I'm going to make in my life.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.030
I remember it was in 2006.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.030
A brother, his name was Ziyad.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.030
He talked to me about Atta.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.030
So I talked to brother Majid.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.030
Ziyad had left the number with him

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.030
and we agreed to meet in my apartment.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.030
I decided I would give the witnesses a chance.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.030
I started to study for a few months.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.030
And after that he told me that he don't want to have a study.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.030
I had a lot of things to deal with.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.030
It was not the right time.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.030
I was too tired to listen.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.030
So I told him, leave me for now,

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.030
because I cannot be bothered with anything.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.030
So what we did, that we just stopped the study.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.030
But I still continue to phone him,

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.030
to visit him from time to time,

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.030
to like the memorial or the convention.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.030
And that's what we did for several years.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.030
But he was very patient with me

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.030
and let it be up to me when and how we should study.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.030
But he kept in contact with me to check how I'm doing.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:52.030
For me, I knew very early that Atta will be a brother a day.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.030
He was so honest.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.030
He loved Jehovah.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.030
He loved Jesus Christ.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.030
And he loved the truth.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.030
He was of great help to me.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.030
When my mother died,

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.029
he and his wife really helped me in a way that changed my life.

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:20.029
He invited me home to him and he asked me,

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:22.029
can you just explain that for me?

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:25.029
Why should I get baptized?

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:30.029
I told my Jesus that I have come to the conclusion,

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:33.029
yes, I must be baptized.

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:36.029
It is important.

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:41.029
What convinced me was the way Jehovah and his organization treats people.

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:45.029
Jehovah is not obligated to provide us with a hope for the future,

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:49.029
but he does so out of love.

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:52.029
He shows us more respect than we show ourselves.

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:57.029
And the way the organization is united cannot come from men.

00:04:57.029 --> 00:05:02.029
So, when I was home, we called Jehovah to Skype

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:08.029
and he told me I can't find any reason anymore not to be baptized.

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:15.029
So, Mahtalkuri, at the regional convention, August 9, 2014,

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:20.339
it was a beautiful day.

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:26.810
It was one of the biggest days in my life.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:33.810
So, it was just a very warm feeling to be beside one of your best friends.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.810
And remember that one day, years ago,

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.810
we were trying to understand the battle without any chance to understand it.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.810
And now we are sitting there, Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.810
I often think, God, is it true?

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.810
Is it real? Do I really deserve to have all these blessings?

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.810
I don't have anything.

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.810
No challenge to not understand everything yet.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:10.300
But still, thanks to God, I can understand the Bible.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.300
I think we don't need to be afraid that some people would never heard about the truth

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.300
if they really want to know that.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.300
Jehovah would take care of it.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:25.300
So, Jehovah was actually way too far out there for many, many, many years.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.300
For me, when I think of the hope of the new world,

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:38.300
I'll be honest and say that it is not a question about having my legs back

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:43.300
and being able to jump like a gazelle, no, that is not what I think about.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.300
Because there are problems in this world, both for me and for others,

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.300
that make my legs not that important.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.300
No, let me have a good conscience, let there be justice.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:00.300
By that I mean that it is God who governs and no one else.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.550
True love, that is what I long for.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:19.730
How did these brothers display the Christian quality of generosity?

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:24.730
Well, for one, a tall friend did his utmost to share the kingdom truth.

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:30.730
But also, the brother who eventually studied with a tall provided loving support

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:37.730
in times of distress, even though a tall had decided not to continue studying the Bible for the time being.

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.730
And what an impact that had.
