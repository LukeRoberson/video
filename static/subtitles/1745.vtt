00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:12.810
I have learned that Jehovah can support me under any circumstances.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.809
I was born and raised in Caraganda, Kazakhstan.

00:00:16.809 --> 00:00:25.420
When I was 25, I lost my job.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.420
A special pioneer brother from my congregation asked me,

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.420
why don't you use this opportunity to start pioneering?

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.420
But I wasn't sure if someone like me could pioneer.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.420
Because he said, don't worry, I'll support you and help you.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.420
I decided to give it a try.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.420
And that brother kept his word, to work with me and help me in my service.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:59.700
Sometime later, I was encouraged to apply for MTS by our circuit overseer

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.700
who had graduated from the first class in Russia.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.700
Even though I thought it was beyond my ability, I listened to him

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.700
and was able to attend the fourth class.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.700
Before graduation, a brother on the branch can be asked me

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.700
if I would be willing to serve in Mongolia as a special pioneer.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.700
Immediately, I said, yes, because I was ready to serve anywhere.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.700
But when I realized how much responsibility comes

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.700
with serving in a foreign assignment, I started to wonder if I could serve

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.909
from Mongolia with my limited experience.

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.909
After graduating in February 1999, I arrived in Ulamatar, Mongolia.

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.909
It was about minus 30 degrees Celsius.

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.909
There was no snow, just a dust storm.

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.909
I'd never seen anything like it before.

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.909
At that time, 17 publishers were serving in Mongolia.

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.909
When preaching, I would recite the introduction

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.909
and then a local publisher would continue the conversation.

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:17.909
Back then, everyone invited us in, offered us tea and candy

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.909
and listened to us.

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:30.900
But I was upset, because I couldn't understand everything.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.900
Often, I had to work alone in the monastery,

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.419
without knowing the language.

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:44.419
I was obligated to Jehovah for courage

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:47.419
and often reflected that right at that moment,

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:50.419
it was like there was no one else preaching

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:52.419
in all of Mongolia but me,

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:55.419
and that the angels were watching over me.

00:02:55.419 --> 00:03:09.150
This thing can give me the strength to continue preaching.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:15.150
In 2001, I married a wonderful sister, Norea.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.150
Jehovah truly blesses our efforts

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.150
when we give him our best and praise intensely.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:29.150
He has helped me many times and has patiently trained me.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:36.150
And because of that, I've been able to serve here for 17 years.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:45.150
I'm very grateful that we have been able to help 20 people come to know Jehovah.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.150
Knowing that people like me, with little experience,

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.150
can be used by Jehovah and his organization,

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.150
helps me appreciate Jehovah's mercy and patience.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:07.659
I thank Jehovah from the bottom of my heart.
