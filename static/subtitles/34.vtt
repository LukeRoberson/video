00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.040
Welcome, brothers and sisters.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.040
This is a historic moment.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.039
Our studio has moved and is now

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.039
located only minutes from the

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.039
New World Headquarters Complex

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:14.039
at Warwick, New York.

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:16.039
And this first program from our

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:18.039
new studio will bring you many

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:20.039
spiritual gems.

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:22.039
First, what obstacles have been

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:25.039
overcome so that common people

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:27.039
can read God's Word?

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:29.039
This exciting documentary,

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:31.039
we will see the courage shown by

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:34.039
William Tindale of England.

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:36.039
What helped two fierce enemies

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:38.039
to become close friends?

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:40.039
The uniting power of the Bible

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:43.039
is evident in this account.

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:45.039
And what can we learn from the

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:47.039
Apostle Paul that will improve

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:48.039
our ministry?

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:50.039
We will find out as we join

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:52.039
this family during their family

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:54.039
worship evening.

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:56.039
This is the January program

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:58.039
of JW Broadcast.

00:02:58.039 --> 00:03:17.419
As Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:20.419
we truly love the Bible.

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:21.419
Why?

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:24.419
Because we know it is God's Word.

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:26.419
That's why we love reading it.

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:28.419
We love studying it.

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:31.419
And we love learning about its history.

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:33.419
When we pause for a moment

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:35.419
and reflect on the many efforts

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:37.419
that have been made through

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:39.419
the centuries to hinder

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.419
and even stop the distribution

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:42.419
of the Bible,

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:44.419
it becomes obvious

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:46.419
that its author,

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:47.419
Jehovah,

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:49.419
has been personally involved

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:50.419
in preserving

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:53.419
and making known his precious Word.

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:55.419
This is very much in harmony

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:56.419
with the thought

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:00.419
in Isaiah chapter 40 and verse 8.

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:03.419
The green grass dries up.

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:05.419
The blossom withers.

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:07.419
But the Word of our God

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:11.699
endures forever.

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:13.699
With that in mind,

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:15.699
I'm happy to speak with you this month

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:18.699
on a theme that's very close to my heart.

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:23.699
The Word of our God endures forever.

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:25.699
The more we come to appreciate

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:27.699
the value of God's Word,

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:29.699
the more we'll be moved to read it,

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:31.699
and even more important,

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:35.699
to apply it in our lives.

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:38.699
Jehovah gave us an outstanding gift

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:40.699
when he inspired faithful men

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:43.699
to record his precious Word.

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:46.699
It's through the pages of God's Word

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:50.699
that we learn just how much God loves us.

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:53.699
Thus, his Word contains guidance

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:54.699
on how to live.

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:58.699
It outlines his purpose in creating us.

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:01.699
It gives us his precious promises

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:05.699
for life everlasting in peace and happiness.

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:08.699
No wonder the Apostle Paul was inspired to write

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:15.699
at 2 Timothy chapter 3 and verses 16 and 17.

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:18.699
All Scripture is inspired of God

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:20.699
and beneficial for teaching,

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:24.699
for reproving, for setting things straight,

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.699
for disciplining in righteousness,

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:31.699
so that the man of God may be fully competent,

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:36.699
completely equipped for every good work.

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:39.699
Of course, Satan the Devil does not want people

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:42.699
to have access to these precious truths

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:45.699
from our Heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:48.699
It's no surprise that there have been many obstacles

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:51.699
to making the Bible available.

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:54.699
While Satan may not have been directly behind all of these,

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:58.699
he certainly had made use of them.

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:00.699
What are some of these obstacles?

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:03.699
And how have they been overcome?

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:06.699
Let's consider the first obstacle,

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:08.699
language barriers.

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:11.699
The first 39 books of the Bible,

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:14.699
which are often called the Old Testament,

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:18.699
were written primarily in the Hebrew language.

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:23.699
These books were known by Hebrew-speaking servants of Jehovah.

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:26.699
However, as time went on,

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:29.699
particularly after the destruction of Babylon,

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:32.699
many Jews established communities

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:34.699
and other nations of the earth.

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:37.699
Many of these Jews spoke Greek.

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:39.699
They no longer used Hebrew.

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:43.699
That meant that many Jews no longer had access

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:47.699
to the scriptures in a language they could understand.

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:49.699
Consider what had happened.

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:52.699
As Alexander the Great conquered more and more

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:54.699
of the then-known world,

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:58.699
Greek gradually became the common language of commerce

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:01.699
and government throughout his empire.

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:05.699
If the Bible was to be understood by the Jews

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:07.699
and by Jewish proselytes

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:11.699
who were scattered throughout this vast Greek-speaking territory,

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:16.699
it needed to be translated into Greek.

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:19.699
Beginning about the year 250 BCE,

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:24.699
the Hebrew scriptures began to be translated into Greek.

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:28.699
In time, that Greek translation came to be known

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:30.699
as the Septuagint.

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:33.699
It was widely and frequently used

00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:37.699
by the Christians in the first century who spoke Greek.

00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:41.699
In fact, the writers of the Christian Greek scriptures,

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:44.699
which is often called the New Testament,

00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:48.699
frequently quoted directly from that translation.

00:07:48.699 --> 00:07:52.699
So that obstacle had been overcome.

00:07:52.699 --> 00:07:56.699
But there were many more language obstacles ahead.

00:07:56.699 --> 00:07:59.699
As the Roman Empire began to flourish,

00:07:59.699 --> 00:08:03.699
Latin replaced Greek as a common language.

00:08:03.699 --> 00:08:07.699
Now, it was necessary to translate the Bible into Latin.

00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:12.699
Some Latin translations of the Bible books began to appear.

00:08:12.699 --> 00:08:16.699
But it was in the year 405 CE

00:08:16.699 --> 00:08:21.699
that Jerome completed the definitive Latin translation of the Bible.

00:08:21.699 --> 00:08:26.699
It came to be known as the Latin Vulgate.

00:08:26.699 --> 00:08:31.699
Jerome's translation would become the standard Bible used by Christendom

00:08:31.699 --> 00:08:36.700
for the next nearly 1,000 years.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:41.700
However, Latin soon became the language of the learned and the elite.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:47.700
So the common people could no longer understand the Bible's message.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.700
During that long period,

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:54.700
there were sincere men that translated portions of the Bible

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.700
into some additional languages.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:01.700
But these translations were, of course, all made by hand.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:07.700
Such handwritten copies of the Bible were rare and expensive.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:14.700
Therefore, access to the Bible in vernacular or common languages was very limited.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:21.700
But language was not the only obstacle that threatened to prevent the distribution of God's Word.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.700
Consider a second factor.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:30.700
Direct opposition to Bible translation and distribution from religious leaders.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:36.700
That opposition started to increase in 1229

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:41.700
when the local church council of Toulouse decreed.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:50.700
We prohibit also that the laity should be permitted to have the books of the old or the New Testament.

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:55.700
In 1234, the council of Taragona decreed,

00:09:55.700 --> 00:10:01.700
no one should possess the books of the old or the New Testament in the vernacular language.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:07.700
And if anyone possesses them, let him deliver them within eight days

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:15.700
from the promulgation of this decree to the local bishop so that they may be burned.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:19.700
Thus, during a very long period in history,

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:25.700
there was limited access to the Bible in the languages spoken by common people.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:30.700
But did that mean that the Word of God would not continue to endure?

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:39.700
Neither language barriers nor opposition from religious leaders could stop God's Word from being made known.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:45.700
Even in those dark times, there were individuals who loved God's Word

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:50.700
and who worked hard to translate it and to make it available to others.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:57.700
Consider John Wickliffe and his followers who were called the lawlers.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:05.700
John Wickliffe and his associates completed the translation of the Bible into English about the year 1382.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:11.700
They eagerly hand-copied the translation and then traveled from village to village

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.700
reading the Bible to the common people.

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:18.700
Despite tremendous opposition from the church,

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:26.700
Wickliffe and his followers made the Bible available to many honest-hearted people in the English language.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:34.700
After Wickliffe died in 1384, great opposition came to his followers.

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:41.700
Many had land and property confiscated. Others were burned at the stake.

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:54.700
In response to the work of Wickliffe and the lawlers, in 1408, Thomas Airendel, Archbishop of Canterbury declared,

00:11:54.700 --> 00:12:02.700
We therefore decree and ordain that no man shall hear after by his own authority

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:13.700
translate any text of the scripture into English or any other tongue upon pain of greater excommunication.

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:19.700
Did such opposition wipe out efforts to translate and make the Bible available?

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:22.700
Absolutely not.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:32.700
The work of Wickliffe and his associates stimulated interest in the Bible throughout England and even as far as Central Europe.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:37.700
Religious leaders were not able to silence the Word of God.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:48.700
In fact, within just a few decades after Wickliffe's death, two factors led to a tremendous increase in the availability of the Bible.

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:56.700
The first, about the year 1454, was the development of printing with movable type.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:05.700
This invention would in time allow for the printing of large quantities of Bibles in many languages.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:16.700
The second factor was the compiling and printing of the Hebrew and Greek original language text of the Holy Scriptures.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:29.700
This allowed many translators to have access to the original language texts so that they then could produce high quality translations in their own languages.

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.700
What was the result?

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:45.700
In the 1500s across Europe, fresh translations were made and printed in vernacular or common languages, including German, English, Italian, French, Dutch, Czech.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:52.700
Danish, Swedish, Spanish, Slovenian, and many others.

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:56.700
However, opposition continued.

00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:08.700
Bible translators were frequently hounded by the Inquisition and some translators like William Tindale and John Rogers were even put to death for their work.

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:18.700
Nonetheless, the Word of God continued to endure and be made available to more and more language groups.

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:24.700
By the early 1800s, Bible translation began to speed up.

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:37.700
Bible societies and intrepid translators began to work in many parts of the earth so that the Bible began to appear in languages of Asia, Africa, the Pacific Islands,

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:41.700
as well as in indigenous languages of the Americas.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:58.700
From 1800 to 1899, some portions of the Bible were translated into some 400 languages and from 1900 to 1950, more than 500 languages were added.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:03.700
Consider what has been accomplished with the New World Translation.

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:17.700
As of this month, the New World Translation has been produced in whole or in part in 149 languages with an additional 37 languages approved.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:28.700
It's obvious that neither language barriers nor opposition from religious leaders was able to stop the distribution of God's Word.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:38.700
Jehovah has protected it through the ages. It's just as Psalm 12 and verse 6 and 7 says,

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:48.700
The sayings of Jehovah are pure. They're like silver refined in an earthen furnace, purified seven times.

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:57.700
You will guard them, O Jehovah. You will protect each one of them from this generation forever.

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:09.700
Yes, Jehovah has protected each one of his precious sayings down through the ages, but consider a third obstacle.

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:20.700
Although the Bible is now available in whole or in part in almost 3,000 languages, many people are no longer interested in reading it.

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:35.700
In our modern age, people have become increasingly skeptical and irreligious. Scientists have extolled the theory of evolution and have made it appear intelligent to doubt the existence of God.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:44.700
At the same time, secular philosophy has encouraged people to make life decisions according to what feels right to them.

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:52.700
What is the result? A world where people are often guided by their own selfish, fleshly desires.

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:59.700
Instead of leading to happiness, many people are left feeling empty and dissatisfied.

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:11.700
How is this third obstacle overcome? Around the world, people are opening God's Word the Bible and reading it for themselves.

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:23.700
They are recognizing that its thoughts are not simply human wisdom. As they apply its principles in their lives, they find contentment and joy.

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:32.700
They develop self-respect and dignity from living according to the upright moral standards outlined by our Creator.

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:39.700
As Psalm 119 verses 97 to 100 state,

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:46.700
How I do love your law, I ponder over it all day long.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:52.700
Your commandment makes me wiser than my enemies because it is with me forever.

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:59.700
I have more insight than all my teachers because I ponder over your reminders.

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:07.700
I act with more understanding than older men because I observe your orders.

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:13.700
What a powerful proof that the Word of God endures forever.

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:21.700
While the advice of human philosophers is frequently flawed, the Bible's counsel works.

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:31.700
If we apply it, it can help us either to overcome or to cope with any problem or situation that we may face.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:39.700
What is more, by explaining God's purpose for the future, it gives us a solid hope.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:45.700
This earth will be restored to the paradise that it was when it was first created.

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:50.700
It will be filled with peace and righteousness.

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:54.700
A wonderful gift Jehovah gave us through the Bible.

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:59.700
Yes, language barriers, opposition from religious leaders,

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:06.700
and even an increasingly irreligious world cannot stop God's Word.

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:12.700
How can you be part of the evidence that the Word of God endures forever?

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.700
Read it every day.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:19.700
Study it, meditate on the deep thoughts that it contains,

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:25.700
and then apply those priceless teachings in your life.

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:32.700
In this way, not just on the printed page, not just on the library shelf,

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:37.700
but in our minds, in our own hearts, in our own lives,

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:43.700
the Word of God will truly endure forever.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:52.700
Now, let's get better acquainted with one of the individuals we just mentioned who truly loved God's Word.

00:19:52.700 --> 00:20:01.700
In the 16th century, English scholar William Tindale had to endure harsh persecution in order to translate the Bible,

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:06.700
but he was convinced that the Bible had to be translated.

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:14.700
You'll notice that this brief documentary has been designed also to appeal to people who are not Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:39.740
as it will later be made available on our official website, jw.org.

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:46.740
In the autumn of 1536, William Tindale was led from his prison cell in the castle of Elvord

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:49.740
to the site of his impending execution.

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:53.740
There a post had been prepared for him.

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:58.740
Tindale was chained to the post, strangled to death,

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:02.740
and then his body burned before the on-looking crowed.

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:04.740
His crime?

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:11.740
Tindale struggled to reconcile the teachings of the church with his own studies of the Bible.

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:18.740
William Tindale died with his faith intact that the Bible is the Word of God.

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:30.180
William Tindale was the first person to seek to translate the Bible from the original languages into English.

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:34.180
Tindale was born in the late 15th century.

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:37.180
He was born in the area of Gloucestershire,

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:41.180
but had the chance to go to Oxford and became a priest.

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:44.180
In the 15th century, there was a lot of resistance,

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:49.180
the idea that the Word of God could just simply be accessible by the general people.

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:55.180
People knew the Latin Bible from church, which was interpreted by the priest, for them.

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:59.180
They never had direct access to the Bible themselves.

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:02.180
Tindale was not allowed to do this translation in England.

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:08.180
He went to the Bishop of London, asking for his permission to translate the New Testament

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:12.180
from the Greek, the original text, into English,

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:15.180
but it was not given that permission.

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:19.750
Such was the opposition to Bible translation.

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:24.750
The Tindale later wrote, there was no place to do it in all England.

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:28.750
And so with the help of merchants sympathetic to his cause,

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:34.750
Tindale fled to Germany, where he could more easily work on his English translation of the New Testament.

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:40.750
By 1525, his translation was complete and ready to be printed.

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:45.750
The British Library in London holds the answer to what happened next.

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:51.750
Dr. Karin Limper Hertz, a lead curator at the library, is going to help us find out.

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:55.750
So we're looking at a unique copy of the first edition of Tindale's New Testament,

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:57.750
printed in Cologne in 1525.

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:03.750
The Cologne fragment is the only known copy of what exists of Tindale's first edition of the New Testament.

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:06.750
The fact that it is a fragment shows that it was a dangerous thing to do.

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:14.750
The printer had too much to drink and mentioned that he was printing this pro-Lutheran English New Testament

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:16.750
for somebody called William Tindale.

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:19.750
The authoritist found out about it and the printer was raided.

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:23.750
Tindale aunties, partners ran, and this is all that survives today.

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:25.750
And they went down the Rhine a bit further to Worms.

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:28.750
So the fact they didn't get much further than partway through Matthew

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:31.750
is quite indicative of how dangerous it was.

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:36.750
The first complete copies of Tindale's translation of the Christian Greek scriptures

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:42.750
were finally printed in the city of Worms in Germany in 1526.

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:47.750
Around 3,000 or more of these books were produced.

00:23:47.750 --> 00:24:00.430
After leaving Germany, Tindale moved to Antwerp.

00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:04.430
This bustling city was ideal for Tindale.

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:11.430
It had a thriving printing industry and its busy port made it easy for his books to reach readers in England.

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:18.430
Professor Guido Latry has kindly offered to show me around the very streets Tindale would have walked himself

00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:20.430
some 500 years ago.

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:27.430
What he saw around him here was ordinary people having access to the Bible in Dutch.

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:31.430
He wanted the same for his own folk in England.

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:35.430
If he wanted to smuggle Bibles on a large scale into England,

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:39.430
this was Northern Europe's biggest seaport.

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:45.430
You can't easily smuggle a big volume and a big format.

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:50.430
So tiny loose leaves that were taken to places like this,

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:52.430
these underground settlers, the warehouses,

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:57.430
and between the leaves of larger books that were not forbidden,

00:24:57.430 --> 00:25:01.430
the tiny leaves of Tindale's translation would have been hidden.

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:03.430
In London, someone would have recognized,

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:06.430
aha, these are the stacks at our mark.

00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:11.430
I must have a look at these and find the loose leaves of Tindale's Bible.

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:17.430
There were about 30,000 copies of Tindale's Bible available by the end of his life.

00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:21.430
This was a brave man and a big man in terms of courage,

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:23.430
and in terms of investment of time,

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:28.430
and the risk he took are not to be underestimated.

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:33.430
William Tindale was imprisoned here in Volvod just north of Brussels.

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:36.430
As he languished in prison for over a year,

00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:40.430
he no doubt contemplated the cruel death inevitably awaited him.

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:45.430
Tindale is often renowned for his influence on the English language,

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:49.430
but his work was more than that of just scholarly ambition.

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:52.430
Tindale loved the Bible.

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:56.430
Maybe it can be said of him that he shared the feelings of the Samist,

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:58.430
who spoke of God's word and said,

00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:01.430
how I do love your law.

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:07.220
Despite intense opposition,

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:11.220
the Bible and the wisdom in it survives to this day,

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:15.220
a faithful transmission of the original rights as words.

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:19.220
No wonder so many have placed such value on the Bible.

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:27.430
You'll be happy to know that later this month

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:31.430
an extended version of this documentary will be made available.

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:34.430
It contains additional examples of individuals

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:38.430
who risked their lives to spread God's word.

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:41.430
The video is called, they valued the Bible,

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:46.430
and will be released on video on demand under the heading, the Bible.

00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:50.430
Knowing that Jehovah is personally involved in preserving

00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:53.430
and making known his word,

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:59.430
we can be confident that the Bible is the only true means of drawing close to him.

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:04.430
As a child, David Sibri from England had not read the Bible.

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:08.430
Instead, he had been taught traditions of men.

00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:11.430
What helped him see the truth?

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:17.500
I was born in 1930.

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:19.500
We lived in Little Hampton,

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:22.500
which was a seaside town,

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:27.359
very pleasant little place, quiet place.

00:27:27.359 --> 00:27:29.359
I would like to walk in the countryside,

00:27:29.359 --> 00:27:31.359
they should intrigue me.

00:27:31.359 --> 00:27:34.359
My interest was in what I saw rather than what I read.

00:27:34.359 --> 00:27:37.359
Well, 1939, war broke out,

00:27:37.359 --> 00:27:41.359
and our road became the second line of defense.

00:27:41.359 --> 00:27:44.359
And then, of course, you get the aircraft.

00:27:44.359 --> 00:27:47.359
Well, there was a young boy, young them myself,

00:27:47.359 --> 00:27:51.359
and one Sunday morning, an air raid took place,

00:27:51.359 --> 00:27:55.359
and the house where he was living was destroyed, and he was killed.

00:27:55.359 --> 00:27:58.359
But I remember saying to my mother,

00:27:58.359 --> 00:28:01.359
why did he have to die?

00:28:01.359 --> 00:28:05.359
And her answer was, well, he's in a better place.

00:28:05.359 --> 00:28:07.359
He's with God in heaven.

00:28:07.359 --> 00:28:10.359
We didn't quite add up to me.

00:28:10.359 --> 00:28:15.359
I couldn't understand how God could be responsible for his death,

00:28:15.359 --> 00:28:18.359
which meant he was responsible for war.

00:28:18.359 --> 00:28:25.359
So it was a whole thing was depressing, perhaps, but it that way.

00:28:25.359 --> 00:28:28.359
As far as religion was concerned,

00:28:28.359 --> 00:28:30.359
I accepted it was there,

00:28:30.359 --> 00:28:33.359
but I couldn't understand how he fitted him or what was going on.

00:28:33.359 --> 00:28:35.359
There was a gap somewhere,

00:28:35.359 --> 00:28:38.359
and I couldn't plug it.

00:28:38.359 --> 00:28:41.359
Every time you went to church, you had a hymn book, and a prayer book.

00:28:41.359 --> 00:28:44.359
But a Bible was something you had personally,

00:28:44.359 --> 00:28:47.359
and the only time I ever opened it,

00:28:47.359 --> 00:28:51.359
was when I began to study with Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:28:51.359 --> 00:28:55.359
I was 17, 18 years of age when I started.

00:28:55.359 --> 00:28:59.359
A brother named Joe Gladwin called upon me.

00:28:59.359 --> 00:29:01.359
I knew nothing about the Bible.

00:29:01.359 --> 00:29:03.359
The fact that he said it very enough,

00:29:03.359 --> 00:29:05.359
he said it was Bible, okay.

00:29:05.359 --> 00:29:07.359
But what do other people say?

00:29:07.359 --> 00:29:10.359
I decided to look for myself.

00:29:10.359 --> 00:29:14.359
I realized that what Joe was telling me was right.

00:29:14.359 --> 00:29:17.359
But he showed me that the Bible was true.

00:29:17.359 --> 00:29:22.359
I began to see that the Bible told me things that I'd never known.

00:29:22.359 --> 00:29:27.359
Over the years, I've been privileged to collect so many different translations of the Bible.

00:29:27.359 --> 00:29:30.359
Reading through the different translations,

00:29:30.359 --> 00:29:33.359
it's clear that God's Word never changes.

00:29:34.359 --> 00:29:38.359
I got baptized at the age of 20 and 1950.

00:29:38.359 --> 00:29:42.359
Over the years, I served first of all as a pioneer.

00:29:42.359 --> 00:29:46.359
From then, I came to Bethel, moving from Bethel

00:29:46.359 --> 00:29:48.359
to the circuit and district work,

00:29:48.359 --> 00:29:52.359
and then finally, coming back to Bethel for the writing desk.

00:29:52.359 --> 00:29:56.359
The assignments I've had have strengthened my conviction,

00:29:56.359 --> 00:30:00.359
not only that Jehovah is giving direction,

00:30:00.359 --> 00:30:04.359
and His Spirit can enable us to do whatever He wants us to do,

00:30:04.359 --> 00:30:07.359
but the organization has grown,

00:30:07.359 --> 00:30:11.359
and with the development of the governing body's direction,

00:30:11.359 --> 00:30:15.359
is an organization which is second to none,

00:30:15.359 --> 00:30:20.359
and therefore staying with it is the logical thing to do.

00:30:20.359 --> 00:30:23.359
In my life, I looked in many places

00:30:23.359 --> 00:30:25.359
for answers to life's questions,

00:30:25.359 --> 00:30:28.359
but only the Bible has provided answers.

00:30:28.359 --> 00:30:33.359
I am so thankful that Jehovah continues to teach us.

00:30:33.359 --> 00:30:41.299
Brother Sibri's appreciation for the Bible is heartwarming.

00:30:41.299 --> 00:30:45.299
Do you remember how we can personally demonstrate our appreciation

00:30:45.299 --> 00:30:50.299
for the Word of God by reading, studying,

00:30:50.299 --> 00:30:53.299
and meditating on the deep thoughts that it contains,

00:30:53.299 --> 00:30:58.299
and then by applying those inspired teachings in our lives?

00:30:59.299 --> 00:31:02.299
When we do that, we allow the Holy Spirit

00:31:02.299 --> 00:31:04.299
to affect our inner being,

00:31:04.299 --> 00:31:09.299
to shape our desires and objectives in life.

00:31:09.299 --> 00:31:12.299
However, what if someone has harbored resentment

00:31:12.299 --> 00:31:14.299
against his fellow man for years,

00:31:14.299 --> 00:31:18.299
perhaps to the point of wanting to kill that person?

00:31:18.299 --> 00:31:23.299
What can God's Word do in such a serious circumstance?

00:31:23.299 --> 00:31:28.299
Remember the words of Hebrews chapter 4 and verse 12,

00:31:28.299 --> 00:31:32.299
for the Word of God is alive and exerts power

00:31:32.299 --> 00:31:37.299
and is able to discern thoughts and intentions of the heart.

00:31:37.299 --> 00:31:40.299
Yes, Jehovah has preserved the Bible

00:31:40.299 --> 00:31:45.299
so that we can benefit from the power of his Word.

00:31:45.299 --> 00:31:48.299
Vladimir Olkov and Valeriy Zaporosky,

00:31:48.299 --> 00:31:50.299
who are from Russia,

00:31:50.299 --> 00:31:52.299
were the fiercest of enemies,

00:31:52.299 --> 00:31:56.299
yet they experienced that power firsthand.

00:31:56.299 --> 00:32:07.420
I was the ringleader of a criminal gang.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:12.339
We extorted money, put people out of business,

00:32:12.339 --> 00:32:15.339
threatened them, dragged them away.

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.440
And they would handle for everything.

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:28.440
People were afraid of me, and I liked it that way.

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:32.390
I never forgave anybody.

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:34.390
If someone wronged me,

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:36.390
I would say,

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:38.390
throw one stone at me,

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:44.140
I'll bury you in a mountain of rocks.

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:47.140
In 1993, I was working for the police.

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:50.140
They assigned me to gather information about a gang

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:55.859
whose leader was Vladimir Olkov.

00:32:55.859 --> 00:32:57.859
One time when committing a crime,

00:32:57.859 --> 00:33:07.220
they caught me at the scene.

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:14.170
I swore revenge on everybody involved with my arrest.

00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:17.170
During interrogations, I did everything to humiliate Vladimir

00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:25.309
and tried to break him up.

00:33:25.309 --> 00:33:28.309
He just hated each other.

00:33:28.309 --> 00:33:31.309
I told Valeriy, just remember.

00:33:31.309 --> 00:33:34.309
Sooner or later, I'm getting out of prison.

00:33:34.309 --> 00:33:36.309
And then, you're a dead man.

00:33:36.309 --> 00:33:38.309
I thought to myself,

00:33:38.309 --> 00:33:39.309
for a start,

00:33:39.309 --> 00:33:41.309
I'm going to blow up his car.

00:33:41.309 --> 00:33:43.309
If he doesn't understand,

00:33:43.309 --> 00:33:47.519
then I'll just eliminate him.

00:33:47.519 --> 00:33:51.519
His threats sounded so serious that I started to fear for my life.

00:33:51.519 --> 00:33:53.519
I decided to have my friends and acquaintances

00:33:53.519 --> 00:33:56.519
make his life behind bars unbearable,

00:33:56.519 --> 00:33:59.519
and to make sure that he would never get out.

00:33:59.519 --> 00:34:08.059
I saw that one of my cellmates had a pocket in New Testament.

00:34:08.059 --> 00:34:10.059
I asked him if I could read it.

00:34:10.059 --> 00:34:13.059
Seeing my interest in spiritual things,

00:34:13.059 --> 00:34:16.059
someone gave me a watchtower magazine.

00:34:16.059 --> 00:34:18.059
When I started reading the magazine,

00:34:18.059 --> 00:34:21.059
I realized that there are other people out there, real people.

00:34:21.059 --> 00:34:24.059
There's a totally different way of life to be had,

00:34:24.059 --> 00:34:27.059
even now, and with such prospects.

00:34:27.059 --> 00:34:30.059
I was just stunned.

00:34:30.059 --> 00:34:34.059
Then I found another five magazines around the prison.

00:34:34.059 --> 00:34:36.059
I devoured them as well,

00:34:36.059 --> 00:34:41.699
and I became thoroughly convinced that I had found the truth.

00:34:41.699 --> 00:34:43.699
When my wife was first allowed to visit me,

00:34:43.699 --> 00:34:45.699
I told her right away,

00:34:45.699 --> 00:34:48.699
I found the truth.

00:34:48.699 --> 00:34:50.699
My wife made pretty fast progress

00:34:50.699 --> 00:34:53.699
and was baptized two years later.

00:34:53.699 --> 00:34:55.699
Her support was invaluable.

00:34:55.699 --> 00:34:57.699
She would visit me,

00:34:57.699 --> 00:34:59.699
constantly encouraging me to be faithful

00:34:59.699 --> 00:35:04.550
and remain loyal to God.

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:07.550
In 1993, Jehovah's Witnesses visited me.

00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:09.550
I agreed to a Bible study,

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:13.550
but the truth didn't touch my heart.

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:17.550
One time, Jehovah's Witnesses invited me to a gathering,

00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:20.550
and there they told me that Vladimir Alkhov,

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:22.550
that criminal was about to get baptized

00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:26.550
and become one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:28.550
I was cut to the heart.

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:31.550
When I got home, I burst into tears.

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:34.550
I realized that I had to make spiritual progress,

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:38.550
because if he and his circumstances could do it,

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:40.550
then I could do it.

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:44.550
That very moment I prayed for the first time in my life.

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:47.550
I was released in October of 1997.

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:49.550
After I was released,

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:51.550
the brothers organized a gathering.

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:54.550
They invited me to this gathering.

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:57.550
I remember that as I was approaching the place,

00:35:57.550 --> 00:36:02.550
I suddenly realized this is where I once conducted a search.

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:05.550
And then, Valeri walks into the room.

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:09.550
We just hugged each other and burst into tears.

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:15.590
And I saw in his eyes a completely different look,

00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:16.590
not like before.

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:18.590
It was a kind look.

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:20.590
It brought tears to my eyes.

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:22.590
It was like a big weight.

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:24.590
It was lifted from my chest.

00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:27.590
My brother, we begged one another for forgiveness.

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:33.219
On the 23rd of November, 1997,

00:36:33.219 --> 00:36:37.219
I was baptized together in the same pool

00:36:37.219 --> 00:36:40.219
as my new friend, Valeri.

00:36:40.219 --> 00:36:45.659
We really became the best of friends.

00:36:45.659 --> 00:36:49.659
And now we serve as elders in the same congregation.

00:36:49.659 --> 00:36:52.659
My wife and I often talk about what would have happened to us

00:36:52.659 --> 00:36:55.659
if we had not started to study the Bible.

00:36:55.659 --> 00:36:58.659
Probably, we wouldn't even be alive by now.

00:36:58.659 --> 00:37:00.659
We've kept our family together,

00:37:00.659 --> 00:37:03.659
even better, we now have a spiritual family

00:37:03.659 --> 00:37:05.659
in the Christian congregation.

00:37:05.659 --> 00:37:09.659
And my former enemy is now my brother and best friend.

00:37:09.659 --> 00:37:14.659
More importantly, we've developed a close relationship with Jehovah.

00:37:14.659 --> 00:37:19.289
Only God is able to change the thinking of such bitter enemies

00:37:19.289 --> 00:37:21.289
as Velad and I were.

00:37:21.289 --> 00:37:25.369
And I eagerly look forward to the day

00:37:25.369 --> 00:37:29.369
when everything that divides people will be gone forever.

00:37:29.369 --> 00:37:41.369
Do you see one reason why Jehovah did not allow his word

00:37:41.369 --> 00:37:44.369
to be obliterated?

00:37:44.369 --> 00:37:47.369
He knew the benefits you and I would reap

00:37:47.369 --> 00:37:50.369
from having access to the Bible.

00:37:50.369 --> 00:37:53.369
Its message is so powerful.

00:37:53.369 --> 00:37:57.369
It could help Vladimir and Valeri to change their lives

00:37:57.369 --> 00:38:00.369
and even become close friends.

00:38:00.369 --> 00:38:05.369
While very few of us have taken part in the translation of the Bible,

00:38:05.369 --> 00:38:08.369
all of us can share it with our neighbors

00:38:08.369 --> 00:38:12.369
and help them to gain accurate knowledge of Jehovah.

00:38:12.369 --> 00:38:14.369
In the following dramatization,

00:38:14.369 --> 00:38:18.369
note some of the theocratic activities that this family enjoys

00:38:18.369 --> 00:38:23.369
and what they had to do to become so zealous.

00:38:23.369 --> 00:38:59.239
Okay, we already know how this story is going to end.

00:38:59.239 --> 00:39:06.530
No real surprise is there.

00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:10.530
So the real question is, how did we get here?

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:19.110
For the record, I never thought our ministry really needed help.

00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:29.650
My wife and daughter were both regular pioneers.

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:34.219
My son was a solid publisher.

00:39:34.219 --> 00:39:37.219
And while my schedule didn't let me pioneer yet,

00:39:37.219 --> 00:39:41.219
I was trying to do all I could to support them.

00:39:41.219 --> 00:39:48.860
I always assumed that this support I could provide

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:52.860
was just being out with them as much as possible.

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:58.300
But I quickly realized more was needed.

00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:05.190
Our field service group overseer had been making a real effort

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:09.190
to work in the ministry with us regularly the last few weeks.

00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:14.190
And he kindly mentioned he'd noticed a few challenges.

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:17.190
While our service time was great,

00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:22.190
he pointed out that our return visits were slowly dwindling.

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:26.190
And other than the studies I had with the children,

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:30.190
no one in the family was conducting a Bible study.

00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:37.820
I asked him what we could do to try and improve the quality of our ministry.

00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:42.820
He showed me Romans 15, 19 highlighting Paul's words.

00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:47.820
I have thoroughly preached the good news about the Christ.

00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:51.820
He suggested on our next family worship night,

00:40:51.820 --> 00:41:10.710
the King Paul's ministry and seeing what we could learn from his example.

00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:13.710
As we looked at Paul's ministry,

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:18.710
we realized to be more productive we needed boldness.

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:22.710
Ephesians 6.19 says,

00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:27.710
pray also for me that the words may be given to me when I open my mouth

00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:30.710
so that I may be able to speak boldly

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:40.340
in making known the sacred secret of the good news.

00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:52.380
Rina also noticed how Paul reasoned persuasively with people.

00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:59.239
And Keiko liked how he found common ground with those he talked to.

00:41:59.239 --> 00:42:03.239
Even referring to a pagan altar to an unknown God

00:42:03.239 --> 00:42:08.239
as a way to direct the conversation to Jehovah.

00:42:08.239 --> 00:42:12.239
Finally, Haruto noted how second Timothy said,

00:42:12.239 --> 00:42:16.239
Paul was a workman with nothing to be ashamed of,

00:42:16.239 --> 00:42:18.239
handling the word of the truth or right.

00:42:19.239 --> 00:42:30.059
So he was skilled in using the scriptures with those he witnessed too.

00:42:30.059 --> 00:42:32.059
See, I told you,

00:42:32.059 --> 00:42:35.059
you already knew how this was going to end.

00:42:35.059 --> 00:42:42.320
I started auxiliary pioneering.

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:56.170
We now have a number of return visits

00:42:56.170 --> 00:43:03.869
and a few progressive Bible studies.

00:43:03.869 --> 00:43:05.869
But how did we get here?

00:43:05.869 --> 00:43:08.869
We learned from the example of Paul

00:43:08.869 --> 00:43:12.869
and how he thoroughly preached the good news.

00:43:12.869 --> 00:43:24.070
The group overseer could have simply listed what changes were needed

00:43:24.070 --> 00:43:26.070
to improve the family's ministry.

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:32.070
Instead, he directed the father to a specific principle found in the scriptures.

00:43:32.070 --> 00:43:39.070
After all, it is only God's word that is inspired for teaching.

00:43:39.070 --> 00:43:42.070
Bible translations in common languages

00:43:42.070 --> 00:43:45.070
started to spread across Europe in the 1500s.

00:43:45.070 --> 00:43:48.070
But it took much longer for more remote places

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:51.070
to receive the Bible.

00:43:51.070 --> 00:43:56.070
It was in 1766 that the complete Greek scriptures

00:43:56.070 --> 00:44:00.070
or New Testament was first published in Greenlandic,

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:05.070
a language spoken today by about 50,000 people.

00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:07.070
In August of last year,

00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:11.070
I had the privilege of serving a regional convention in Greenland,

00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:14.070
which is overseen by the Scandinavia branch.

00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:17.070
Greenland is the neighbor to the north of Newfoundland,

00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:20.070
where I pioneered for 11 years.

00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:25.070
So it was a wonderful experience to go there and meet our brothers.

00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:29.070
Some 400 brothers and sisters traveled at their own expense

00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:34.070
from all over Scandinavia to support the convention in Greenland.

00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:38.070
Although Greenland is a land covered by large ice caps,

00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:43.070
there are many warm hearts yearning for the truth.

00:44:43.070 --> 00:44:57.989
I think that Jesus had Greenland in mind when he spoke about preaching

00:44:57.989 --> 00:45:01.989
to the most distant part of the earth.

00:45:01.989 --> 00:45:03.989
My name is Arna Matson.

00:45:03.989 --> 00:45:07.989
My wife Karen and I have lived in Greenland for more than 34 years.

00:45:07.989 --> 00:45:11.989
We have traveled all over the country preaching about God's kingdom

00:45:11.989 --> 00:45:15.989
and we have had some fantastic experiences.

00:45:15.989 --> 00:45:21.989
In the 1950s, two young special pioneers came to Greenland as the first publishers.

00:45:21.989 --> 00:45:24.989
They traveled by boat from town to town,

00:45:24.989 --> 00:45:27.989
carrying just tents and simple equipment.

00:45:27.989 --> 00:45:32.989
They had to endure the cold weather, face resistance from the local ministers,

00:45:32.989 --> 00:45:36.989
and even fight with sledge dogs that took their food.

00:45:36.989 --> 00:45:42.989
But they laid the groundwork for the great effort that has been made to preach to all in this country.

00:45:43.989 --> 00:45:50.989
In the 1960s and 70s, many families moved here from Denmark to help with the preaching work.

00:45:50.989 --> 00:45:57.989
I remember how I as a teenager in 1971 moved from Denmark to Greenland with my family.

00:45:57.989 --> 00:46:00.989
It was not easy to learn the language,

00:46:00.989 --> 00:46:06.989
but the brothers and sisters from Denmark did their best and it had a good effect on the territory.

00:46:07.989 --> 00:46:11.989
In 1973, the watchtower began to be published in Greenlandic.

00:46:11.989 --> 00:46:14.989
Just to pronounce the name,

00:46:14.989 --> 00:46:18.989
Nabazoliak, Alabama, Suifik, was a challenge.

00:46:18.989 --> 00:46:22.989
But it has been a popular magazine in Greenland ever since.

00:46:22.989 --> 00:46:29.369
Once we met a couple who for many years had received copies of the watchtower

00:46:29.369 --> 00:46:32.369
when publishers visited their settlement.

00:46:32.369 --> 00:46:36.369
They told us that they often felt depressed when they woke up in the morning.

00:46:38.369 --> 00:46:44.369
But when they read the magazine, they felt better, and they would read the same copies over and over again.

00:46:44.369 --> 00:46:53.960
When the temperature drops and there's no falls,

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:58.960
the landscape gets covered by a beautiful white blanket for half a year.

00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:03.429
So the publishers make good use of the summer.

00:47:03.429 --> 00:47:07.429
Some towns and settlements only seldom receive a witness.

00:47:07.429 --> 00:47:12.429
There are no roads between the towns, but we reach isolated areas by boats.

00:47:12.429 --> 00:47:17.429
When someone shows interest in our message, the contact is maintained by phone.

00:47:17.429 --> 00:47:21.059
Many have great respect for the Bible,

00:47:21.059 --> 00:47:27.059
and so my book of Bible stories has found its way into many, many homes.

00:47:27.059 --> 00:47:30.059
Over a period of 24 years,

00:47:30.059 --> 00:47:35.059
Karen and I have sailed so much that it equals a trip twice around the globe.

00:47:35.059 --> 00:47:37.059
This has caused a lot of effort and money,

00:47:37.059 --> 00:47:39.059
but with Jehovah's blessing,

00:47:39.059 --> 00:47:42.059
we have been able to continue year after year

00:47:42.059 --> 00:47:45.059
preaching to the distant parts of Greenland.

00:47:45.059 --> 00:47:53.809
The preaching work here is a great experience.

00:47:53.809 --> 00:47:56.809
People are attentive and kind,

00:47:56.809 --> 00:48:00.809
but it took a long time before the first native Greenlander was baptized,

00:48:00.809 --> 00:48:04.809
actually 18 years of zealous preaching.

00:48:04.809 --> 00:48:12.760
Today there are more than 150 publishers in five congregations.

00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:27.940
Jehovah has really blessed the work that has been done here for more than 60 years.

00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:29.940
In August 2016,

00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:34.940
a very special convention was held in the capital of Munich.

00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:37.940
Brothers and sisters from all over Scandinavia

00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:45.489
traveled all the way to attend the convention.

00:48:45.489 --> 00:48:50.489
We were very encouraged by the visit of a member of the governing body, Brother Mark Sanderson,

00:48:50.489 --> 00:48:56.530
who gave us some faith-strengthening talks.

00:48:56.530 --> 00:49:01.530
I think it's a great privilege to be able to understand the truth.

00:49:01.530 --> 00:49:07.530
It's amazing that Jehovah gave his attention to an insignificant human like me.

00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:15.530
When I started to follow the Bible's unique teachings and principles,

00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:22.530
I clearly understood how it would benefit my own life.

00:49:22.530 --> 00:49:28.530
After this convention, even though we live in small towns far away from the rest of the world,

00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:32.530
we feel closer than ever before to the worldwide Brotherhood.

00:49:32.530 --> 00:49:46.659
The peak attendance at the convention was 614, the largest ever in Greenland.

00:49:46.659 --> 00:49:50.659
Our brothers from other parts of Scandinavia who attended the convention

00:49:50.659 --> 00:49:54.659
also took part in a campaign inviting interested ones.

00:49:54.659 --> 00:49:59.659
In only two hours, the whole capital city of Nook was covered.

00:49:59.659 --> 00:50:02.659
It was a wonderful witness.

00:50:02.659 --> 00:50:06.659
And speaking of witnessing in the most distant part of the earth,

00:50:06.659 --> 00:50:10.659
you'll be happy to know that Brother Jeffrey Jackson of the governing body

00:50:10.659 --> 00:50:13.659
recently explained in a morning worship

00:50:13.659 --> 00:50:18.659
how the Bible was translated into numerous languages in the 19th century.

00:50:18.659 --> 00:50:22.659
That segment is now available on Video On Demand.

00:50:22.659 --> 00:50:27.659
It is entitled Reaching the Most Distant Part.

00:50:27.659 --> 00:50:32.659
And later this month, a beautiful segment from the 2011 annual meeting

00:50:32.659 --> 00:50:35.659
will be posted for your enjoyment.

00:50:35.659 --> 00:50:40.659
It is an interview with five widows of governing body members.

00:50:40.659 --> 00:50:43.659
The sisters relate how they learn the truth

00:50:43.659 --> 00:50:48.659
and share treasured memories from their many years of faithful service.

00:50:48.659 --> 00:50:53.659
This segment is entitled Interview with Faithful Sisters,

00:50:53.659 --> 00:50:58.659
widows of governing body members, and will be available on Video On Demand

00:50:58.659 --> 00:51:02.659
under the Interviews and Experiences category.

00:51:02.659 --> 00:51:08.659
Do you agree that Jehovah gave us an outstanding gift in his word?

00:51:08.659 --> 00:51:14.659
He not only gave us the gift, but also made sure time and time again

00:51:14.659 --> 00:51:18.659
that it was preserved for our benefit.

00:51:18.659 --> 00:51:21.659
Individuals we met earlier in the program,

00:51:21.659 --> 00:51:25.659
such as Brothers David Sibri, Vladimir Olkov,

00:51:25.659 --> 00:51:30.659
and Valeri Zaporosky have all seen the effects of the power

00:51:30.659 --> 00:51:36.659
that God's word exerts, and the guidance it provides.

00:51:36.659 --> 00:51:40.659
We also saw that the Bible is beneficial for teaching

00:51:40.659 --> 00:51:45.659
and for setting things straight as we watch the family learn how to improve

00:51:45.659 --> 00:51:50.659
their ministry by following the example of the Apostle Paul.

00:51:50.659 --> 00:51:57.659
Yes, God's word has endured and will continue to endure forever.

00:51:57.659 --> 00:52:05.659
As you know, on April 3, 2017, our museums in Warwick will open to the public.

00:52:05.659 --> 00:52:11.659
In addition to our enlarged gallery entitled The Bible and the Divine Name,

00:52:11.659 --> 00:52:15.659
we will also have a new gallery on the theme,

00:52:15.659 --> 00:52:18.659
The Word of God endures forever.

00:52:18.659 --> 00:52:21.659
Please come and visit.

00:52:21.659 --> 00:52:25.659
You'll be happy to see a wonderful collection of Bibles

00:52:25.659 --> 00:52:30.659
that illustrates the points we have discussed in this broadcast.

00:52:30.659 --> 00:52:33.659
The psalmist was inspired to write,

00:52:33.659 --> 00:52:36.659
how I do love your law,

00:52:36.659 --> 00:52:42.659
and we agree we love Jehovah and we love the Bible.

00:52:42.659 --> 00:52:45.659
And so have millions throughout the centuries,

00:52:45.659 --> 00:52:50.659
including those who were used by Jehovah to preserve his word.

00:52:50.659 --> 00:52:52.659
With these thoughts in mind,

00:52:52.659 --> 00:52:59.659
let's enjoy this month's music video entitled Your Word endures forever.

00:53:00.659 --> 00:53:22.380
Looked up at the start,

00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:30.110
godly fear in their heart,

00:53:30.110 --> 00:53:32.110
they thank their God up above,

00:53:32.110 --> 00:53:39.639
for revealing to them his love.

00:53:39.639 --> 00:53:42.639
So you gave them your name,

00:53:42.639 --> 00:53:48.010
kingdom hoped to proclaim,

00:53:48.010 --> 00:53:52.659
a word preserved for our day,

00:53:52.659 --> 00:53:59.780
their faithful words to show us the way.

00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:02.780
They loved you from there,

00:54:02.780 --> 00:56:26.320
that just wants a key.

00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:48.460
A beautiful song indeed.

00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:50.460
We would like to conclude this program

00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:54.460
by sharing these greetings from our brothers and sisters in Mali.

00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:57.460
Mali is located in Western Africa,

00:56:57.460 --> 00:57:00.460
reaching well into the Sahara Desert.

00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:03.460
The northern part of the country is hot and covered with sand,

00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:05.460
but the southern region,

00:57:05.460 --> 00:57:07.460
which is watered by the Niger River,

00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:11.460
is green with forests and vegetation.

00:57:11.460 --> 00:57:14.460
The witnesses in the country have a huge task,

00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:17.460
as the ratio of Jehovah's Witnesses to population

00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:22.460
is about one publisher to 59,000 residents.

00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:25.460
Also, the distances are tremendous.

00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:29.460
The approximately 300 publishers cover an area

00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:33.460
more than twice the size of the country of France.

00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:36.460
Mali is one of the hottest countries in the world,

00:57:36.460 --> 00:57:40.460
so some groups and congregations hold their meetings outdoors,

00:57:40.460 --> 00:57:43.460
under the cool shade of a tree.

00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:47.460
Although the official language of the country is French,

00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:51.460
most people better understand the local language, Bambara.

00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:56.460
Thus, most meetings are either held or interpreted in Bambara.

00:57:56.460 --> 00:57:59.460
Recently, language classes were held in Beaumont,

00:57:59.460 --> 00:58:02.460
which is another local language.

00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:06.460
Also, the seven publishers of the American Sign Language Week

00:58:06.460 --> 00:58:11.460
have been assigned to witness to the more than 350,000 people

00:58:11.460 --> 00:58:14.460
in Mali who have a hearing impairment.

00:58:14.460 --> 00:58:17.460
Last year, the total attendance for the memorial

00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:20.460
was over 1,100 people.

00:58:20.460 --> 00:58:24.460
One man who received an invitation walked three kilometers,

00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:27.460
or almost two miles to attend the memorial,

00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:31.460
despite having a physical challenge with his foot.

00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:33.460
He is now regular at the meetings

00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:36.460
and is making good progress.

00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:40.460
Recently, a new kingdom hall was built in the capital city.

00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:44.460
Municipal and state authorities, neighbors and many passers-by

00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:47.460
have been amazed at what they have seen,

00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:50.460
and they have praised the brothers working on the project.

00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:54.460
Our brothers and sisters in Mali send us their love.

00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:58.460
We love them, and we love all of you.

00:58:58.460 --> 00:59:02.460
This is JW Broadcasting from the World Headquarters

00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:05.460
of Jehovah's Witnesses.
