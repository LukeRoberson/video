00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:08.730
But you know, there's more to the story.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.529
Phil didn't know just how tense things were between Tim and I.

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:16.730
No idea.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.429
We never talked.

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:22.429
I mean, really talked about it.

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:39.009
Until it was too late.

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:43.270
We need to talk.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.369
I think we need to seriously reconsider Phil's qualifications.

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:48.070
You know he's not the type of brother that...

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.270
Enough.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.469
Enough about Phil.

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:52.469
I know he's your friend.

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:52.969
Friend.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.570
But the body agreed that the friend...

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.570
Friend?

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.369
Friend?

00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:00.170
He's worked with us for years.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.570
The body decided unanimously that he should no longer serve.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.329
Because you pushed them.

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:09.530
Excuse me?

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.129
It's enough that we have those outside the congregation

00:01:12.129 --> 00:01:12.930
putting pressure on us.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:13.930
We do not need more in here.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.480
Seriously, think.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.280
The conversation.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.780
The argument.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.079
It was terrible.

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:27.590
We both said things we didn't mean.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:48.670
And after that, we both handled the situation poorly.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:02:10.069
We needed to make things right.

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.650
It wasn't easy.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.780
But we talked it out.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.979
And we made peace.

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:24.009
With Jehovah's help.

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:26.610
Can you imagine what it would have been like in that cell block

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.810
if we hadn't?

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.710
We finally told Phil the whole story.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.009
Once we were all roommates.

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:39.139
Wow.

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:40.139
Let's go sing.

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:44.840
Our soul we see.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:54.180
God's people are lit with our eyes.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.379
We see beyond the clouds.

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:01.780
And know that the storm soon will see.
