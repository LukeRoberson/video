00:00:05.139 --> 00:00:09.630
Who is the author of the Bible?

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:17.780
The Bible is a collection of 66 small books.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:25.750
Over 3,500 years ago, Moses began writing the first of those books.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:34.479
During the next 1600 years, some 40 different men wrote the remaining books that make up the Bible.

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:40.979
If men wrote the text, why is the Bible called the Word of God?

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.579
Consider this.

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.079
When a businessman wants to send an important message,

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.579
he might use a secretary to write a letter or an email.

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.920
The employer tells his secretary the thoughts he wants to convey,

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.820
and the secretary compiles those thoughts into the email.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.819
Although the secretary types the email, he is not the author.

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:11.219
In a similar way, the Bible writers express thoughts and feelings

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:16.319
in their own style, but the message did not originate with them.

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:18.620
So where did it come from?

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.920
The Bible says all scripture is inspired of God.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.219
Jehovah God used his power to guide their minds, transmitting his thoughts to them.

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:31.420
How did he do this?

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:39.590
While the prophet Daniel was asleep, Jehovah caused him to have dreams.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.689
Others, like the prophet Ezekiel,

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:47.469
were awake when God caused them to see incredible visions.

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:51.670
Sometimes, Jehovah used angels to communicate his thoughts,

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.370
such as when he spoke with the Apostle John.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:01.980
But could Jehovah God really transmit his message in these ways?

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:14.229
Today, people can communicate their thoughts over great distances.

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:18.030
They can even communicate with astronauts in outer space.

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:33.490
If humans can do this, is it not reasonable to conclude that their creator can do far more?

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.889
We can trust the Bible, because it was authored not by man,

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:41.889
but by our loving creator, Jehovah God.
