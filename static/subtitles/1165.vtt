00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:11.279
Welcome to the 2020 Always Rejoice Regional Convention of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:16.739
From the start, we wish to convey to you greetings from the governing body and the entire

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:23.640
Bethel family, and we want you to know that we love you, and we keep you in our prayers.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.440
So now, whether you are watching this from home or from some other location, this is

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.079
our convention for 2020.

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.280
And what an encouraging theme, Always Rejoice.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.679
We need to discuss this subject now more than ever before, don't we?

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:47.000
Is it possible to rejoice as the world crumbles around us?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.600
Yes it is.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.240
Those who love Jehovah can always find reasons to rejoice.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:59.000
Throughout this convention, we will discuss four things that will help us to rejoice.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.799
What are they?

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:05.480
Number one, we will consider the reasons we have for rejoicing.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.319
Two, we will examine how we can cultivate godly joy.

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:15.200
Three, we will look at how we can maintain joy, despite trials.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.200
And four, we will discuss how to express joy.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.680
That is the joy we receive from serving Jehovah.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.739
Now let's lay the foundation for all of this by first answering the question, what is

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:32.159
true joy?

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.900
What is commonly called joy is an emotion that is stirred by a feeling of well-being,

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.159
by a sense of success, or because of expecting something good.

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.359
And for this reason, joy may seem to come and go depending on what is happening around

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:49.640
us.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.239
You might call it circumstantial joy.

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:57.519
But that is not the case with true joy, why?

00:01:57.519 --> 00:02:04.599
Because true joy, godly joy, is an aspect of the fruitage of God's Holy Spirit.

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:09.800
True joy is a quality of the heart that is not dependent on external things happening

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.840
around us.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.879
This godly quality comes from knowing that you have the truth, that you are doing what

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:22.560
please is God, and that your kingdom hope is certain to be fulfilled.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.759
So then, we see there is a big difference between having circumstantial joy and having joy

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:31.039
of Holy Spirit.

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:37.199
This is illustrated for us in the Scriptures by the example of the Christians in Thessalonica.

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:42.719
The Apostle Paul and others helped them to prepare ahead of time to face persecution

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:50.719
with joy, and prepare they did, how they became strong in faith.

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:57.479
Let's read about what this did for them at first Thessalonians chapter 1 and verse 6.

00:02:57.479 --> 00:03:03.759
As we read the verse, ask yourself, where did their deep-seated joy come from?

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:10.400
The verse reads, and you became imitators of us and of the Lord, seeing that you accepted

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:17.159
the word under much tribulation with joy of Holy Spirit.

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:19.719
Where did their joy come from?

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:21.960
Two things are mentioned.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.520
They imitated good examples, and they had the joy that comes from having God's Holy

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.680
Spirit on them.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:37.120
We too can acquire joy of Holy Spirit as mentioned here by applying what we learn and seeking

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.759
Jehovah's blessing, His Spirit.

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:46.719
Godly joy is not a mere personality trait that we are born with then is it, and it doesn't

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:51.199
come to us simply because of pleasant circumstances.

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:57.400
Joy of Holy Spirit is found deep within us, and so it should not be confused with simply

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.639
being cheerful or exuberant.

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:03.479
Godly joy is not superficial.

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:07.879
It's not found in constantly smiling or laughing.

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:13.240
To show the difference, think of a comedian who seems to be able to find what is funny

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.680
in just about any situation in life.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.839
But deep down inside, He may be very unhappy.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:28.839
In contrast, like the Christians in Thessalonica, we can have joy of Holy Spirit even when we

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:31.079
are under tribulation.

00:04:31.079 --> 00:04:38.800
We may not smile through a bad time, but our deep inner joy in serving Jehovah is immovable.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.920
It's part of the new personality that true Christians put on in order to be like Christ.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.519
Now, with this basic understanding of Godly joy in mind, let's give our attention to

00:04:51.519 --> 00:04:58.560
Brother Stephen Let, a member of the governing body, as He welcomes us to this always rejoice

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.199
convention.

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:09.300
And please listen carefully, as He explains why Godly joy is such a special quality.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:17.100
Welcome to the always rejoice convention of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:25.300
We're so happy that you were able to arrange to attend all three days of this convention.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:35.060
Why were the Apostle Paul's words at Philippians 4.4 chosen as the theme for this year's convention?

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:43.860
Well over the past four years, the governing body has used conventions to highlight qualities

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:53.180
that endear us to Jehovah and help us to be victorious in our struggle against Satan and

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.500
his world.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:07.660
We've had convention themes that focused on the need for loyalty, endurance, courage,

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.540
and love.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:16.579
This year the convention theme highlights the need for joy.

00:06:16.579 --> 00:06:25.899
At Nehemiah 8.10 we're told the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:32.699
In the near future our faith will be tested as never before.

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:38.779
But if we acquire true joy with the help of God's Holy Spirit, we will be able to stand

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:45.980
firm and weather all the storms that come our way.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:51.139
Sadly, joy is a deep-seated quality of the heart.

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:57.860
It's a state of happiness that remains whether the conditions around us are pleasant or

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.620
not.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:09.019
In fact, a person can be disturbed about something, but still have joy in his heart.

00:07:09.019 --> 00:07:14.860
For example, the Apostles were flogged for speaking about the Christ.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:21.740
But they went out from before the Sanadran rejoicing because they had been counted worthy

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.980
to be dishonored in behalf of his name.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:32.699
Obviously, they weren't rejoicing over the flogging they had received, but as servants

00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:41.180
of God they found true joy in keeping their integrity to him.

00:07:41.259 --> 00:07:48.620
However, is it possible for a Christian always to be rejoicing?

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:56.939
Yes, because true joy is an aspect of the fruitage of God's Holy Spirit.

00:07:56.939 --> 00:08:05.819
As an inward quality, joy is not dependent on external things, not even on our brothers,

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:10.300
but it does depend on God's Spirit.

00:08:10.379 --> 00:08:18.300
And as already noted, our joy comes from that deep inner satisfaction of knowing that we have

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:26.379
the truth, that we're doing what pleases Jehovah and that our kingdom hope is sure.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:35.419
So, Godly joy is not the transient joy that people experience because they've secured a

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:45.580
well-paying job. Gone on an exotic vacation, attain fame and prestige, or acquire some coveted

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:56.299
material item or large sum of money. No. True joy has to be cultivated by means of Holy Spirit.

00:08:57.179 --> 00:09:04.539
To obtain Jehovah's Holy Spirit, we have to draw close to Him and give Him exclusive devotion

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:14.299
at Acts 532. We're told that God gives Holy Spirit to those obeying Him as ruler.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:24.940
During these three days, the convention program will help us to deepen our appreciation for Godly joy.

00:09:26.059 --> 00:09:34.379
We'll learn what true joy is, how to cultivate it, how to maintain it during difficult times.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:45.500
And how to display it as it wells up in our hearts. Such joy will clearly identify us as disciples

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:55.820
of Jesus, and it will enable us to serve as beacons of light in this dark world and draw others

00:09:55.820 --> 00:10:04.460
to our happy God. You'll note that nearly the entire second day has been devoted to the joy

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:14.299
of disciple-making. Godly joy will help us to face challenges to our integrity. Remember that it

00:10:14.299 --> 00:10:22.539
was the joy that was set before Him that helped Jesus to face an excruciating death on a torture

00:10:22.539 --> 00:10:31.179
stake. So please pay rapt attention to the talks and videos. Look up the scriptures and read them

00:10:31.179 --> 00:10:40.299
along with the speakers. Thus allowing God's Word to exert its powerful force on your heart.

00:10:41.259 --> 00:10:50.940
May this convention become a milestone in your development as a joyful imitator of our happy God.

00:10:52.379 --> 00:11:01.019
How thankful we are that He made us in His image, giving us the capacity to feel

00:11:01.019 --> 00:11:09.820
and express Godly joy. And how thankful we are that He also gives us His Holy Spirit to help us

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:20.940
cultivate that kind of joy. We love you very much. And we pray that each one of you will forever

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:29.980
respond to the words of the Psalmist at Psalm 100 verse 2. Serve Jehovah with rejoicing.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:41.230
Come into His presence with joyful shouting. We wish to thank Brother Lead for building up our

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:49.070
anticipation for this always rejoice convention. As Brother Lead highlighted, Godly joy is indeed

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:57.789
a very special quality. Such true joy comes from Jehovah Himself. In fact, the Bible says that He

00:11:57.789 --> 00:12:05.789
always has reasons to rejoice. So much so that being happy describes His personality.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:11.870
Let's see this for ourselves as we read 1 Timothy chapter 1 and verse 11.

00:12:12.909 --> 00:12:19.309
The context in verses 8 through 10 lists many of the bad qualities and actions that people

00:12:19.309 --> 00:12:25.950
of this world display. But they can change if they listen to our joyful God Jehovah.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:33.710
With that in mind, note the Apostle Paul's inspired words in verse 11 as he goes on to say,

00:12:34.509 --> 00:12:40.669
according to the glorious good news of the happy God with which I was entrusted.

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:48.350
Why can Jehovah be called happy despite seeing all of the problems and suffering on the earth?

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:53.389
Well, among the many things that may come happy are the following four.

00:12:54.350 --> 00:13:02.669
1. Jehovah is the Creator. Everything He does is perfect. Due to Ronomy 32 in verse 4 says,

00:13:03.309 --> 00:13:11.070
perfect is His activity. For this reason, Jehovah can rightly rejoice in His creation. That fact

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:19.149
is undeniable, and it's clearly stated in Psalm 104 and verse 31. As we read it together,

00:13:19.789 --> 00:13:26.029
consider how determined Jehovah is to keep His joy. Verse 31 says,

00:13:27.549 --> 00:13:34.509
the glory of Jehovah will last forever. Jehovah will rejoice in His works.

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:43.389
The point? Jehovah will not be denied. Well, He will find joy in what He has accomplished.

00:13:43.389 --> 00:13:49.950
No one can take that from Him. He's the happy God whose purpose for man and for the earth will

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:58.590
be realized. Adding to His happiness is reason number two. Jehovah is generous, and we know what the

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:05.789
Bible says about those who give, and aren't we grateful for all that Jehovah is providing to help

00:14:05.789 --> 00:14:12.990
us and support us now through a very difficult time? Number three, Jehovah's heart is made

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:18.669
glad by the faithfulness of His servants. He never forgets all that we have done.

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:28.190
At Proverbs 23 15, He says, if your heart becomes wise, then my own heart will rejoice.

00:14:29.309 --> 00:14:35.710
If we remain faithful to Jehovah, the joy that we can bring to Him will last forever.

00:14:36.429 --> 00:14:45.149
And number four, because Jehovah is perfect, He always does what is right. He will never do anything

00:14:45.149 --> 00:14:52.110
to spoil His own happiness. Well, now that we have looked at what makes Jehovah the happy God,

00:14:52.110 --> 00:15:00.029
we want to know what makes us happy. That is what makes us truly happy, deep down inside happy.

00:15:00.669 --> 00:15:04.750
After all, it's not difficult to find superficial happiness.

00:15:05.549 --> 00:15:11.389
For instance, when you're near someone with a funny laugh, do you often find yourself laughing

00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:16.590
as well? It happens, right? You may not even know what you're laughing about, true?

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:23.789
The point is this, it's not all that difficult to experience superficial happiness,

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:31.309
but to find lasting joy, takes effort, and it takes appreciation for what we have.

00:15:32.509 --> 00:15:38.669
We will now look at some of the things that bring us real joy. And as you might expect,

00:15:39.149 --> 00:15:47.470
it begins with Jehovah. Our relationship with Jehovah is our foremost reason for joy.

00:15:48.269 --> 00:15:56.590
But not just any relationship. Take note of what is needed as we read Psalm 16 and verse 11.

00:15:58.269 --> 00:16:06.029
As we do so first, notice what Jehovah does. Next, see what type of relationship we can have with Him.

00:16:06.669 --> 00:16:12.990
Then, make the connection to having joy. Psalm 16 verse 11 reads,

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:21.870
You make known to me the path of life in your presence is abundant joy.

00:16:23.549 --> 00:16:29.710
So again, first, what does Jehovah do? He kindly makes the path of life known to us.

00:16:30.509 --> 00:16:38.590
Next, what type of relationship can we have with Him? A very close one, it says, as if in his very

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:48.830
presence. Then we read that in his presence, there's what? Abundant joy. Now, along with having

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:56.509
a close relationship with Jehovah, as mentioned there, what else brings us joy? Jehovah's Holy

00:16:56.509 --> 00:17:03.870
Spirit does. His Holy Spirit generates joy in those who receive it. For this reason, we should

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:11.549
pray to receive His Holy Spirit every day. What else promotes true joy within us? Our marvelous hope.

00:17:12.509 --> 00:17:18.349
Also, we have an abundance of spiritual food, even under difficult circumstances.

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:27.789
That joyful blessing was foretold in God's word. To see it, please go to Isaiah chapter 65 and

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:36.750
verses 13 and 14. Now, in these verses, Jehovah draws a contrast between good people and bad people

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:45.950
when he says this, starting in verse 13. Therefore, this is what the sovereign Lord Jehovah says,

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:54.349
Look, my servants will eat, but you will go hungry. Look, my servants will drink, but you will go

00:17:54.349 --> 00:18:03.549
thirsty. Look, my servants will rejoice, but you will suffer shame. Look, my servants will shout

00:18:03.549 --> 00:18:11.069
joyfully because of the good condition of the heart, but you will cry out because of the pain

00:18:11.069 --> 00:18:19.359
of heart. Do you see yourself on Jehovah's side of this contrast? If you've been keeping up with

00:18:19.359 --> 00:18:26.079
God's organization, you should feel well fed spiritually. The bad conditions of this world

00:18:26.079 --> 00:18:33.759
must not be permitted to take away from our joy. As Jehovah said, we shall joyfully. Why? Because

00:18:33.759 --> 00:18:40.799
of the good condition of the heart, we are more ready than ever before to see the realization of

00:18:40.799 --> 00:18:48.880
our hope. On the other hand, the world around us is suffering because they lack clear direction.

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:55.759
And they are without real hope. Throughout our lives, and especially at times like this,

00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:02.319
we should take note of Jehovah's help. When we see that Jehovah is helping us,

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:11.200
we know that he is with us. We just know it, and this too brings us immense joy. Also,

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:17.039
we find joy in hearing the expressions of faith that come from our dear brothers and sisters,

00:19:17.039 --> 00:19:23.839
don't we? And this is true whether we meet together for worship in person or whether we meet by

00:19:23.839 --> 00:19:32.319
means of video. In fact, with so much to add to our inner joy, we can come to have a joy so

00:19:32.319 --> 00:19:40.160
strong and so deep within us that nothing can shake it. Even persecution, though not enjoyable in

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:47.440
itself, can lead to joy. How so? As Jesus said at Matthew 5, 11, and 12,

00:19:49.039 --> 00:19:56.079
happy are you when people reproach you and persecute you and lyingly say every sort of wicked thing

00:19:56.079 --> 00:20:06.000
against you for my sake. Rejoice and be overjoyed since your reward is great. So how can we be joyful

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:15.119
even though we are persecuted? Because when we endure persecution with joy and keep our integrity,

00:20:15.119 --> 00:20:23.200
we gain a victory and Jehovah's approval. Jesus said rejoice and be overjoyed since your reward

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:31.200
is great. Well, so far we have defined true joy. We have examined why Jehovah is called the

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:37.519
happy God and we have reviewed a number of things that bring us godly joy. But at this point,

00:20:37.519 --> 00:20:44.960
you may be wondering, can I really be happy if I am suffering? That's a very good question.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:50.960
So let's look some more at how or in what sense we can always rejoice.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:58.240
The fact is that at times all of us may be saddened by injustice, poor health,

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:06.960
unemployment, grief, or other causes for anxiety, such as mankind has experienced with this global

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:12.799
pandemic. And many of our brothers and sisters have been affected by such things, haven't they?

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:19.680
Since that is the case, let's look at how we can apply the words of our convention theme

00:21:19.759 --> 00:21:28.079
at Philippians chapter 4 and verse 4. Now, as we read verse 4, Philippians 4-4,

00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:37.039
imagine the Apostle Paul writing this while he was in prison bonds or chains, yet full of faith

00:21:37.039 --> 00:21:46.319
he said this with God's spirit on him. Always rejoice in the Lord. Again, I will say rejoice.

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:56.559
Why could Paul say this so infatically? Because the Apostle Paul was a man who had true godly joy.

00:21:56.559 --> 00:22:03.279
Paul had true joy that was not dependent on what was happening around him or what was happening to him.

00:22:03.279 --> 00:22:10.079
From a heart filled with faith, he said that he had joy that was focused in or on the Lord.

00:22:11.039 --> 00:22:17.119
That is why Paul was joyful despite any injustice or anxiety that he experienced.

00:22:18.319 --> 00:22:25.839
Always rejoice, he said. Again, rejoice. What will help us to apply these inspired words?

00:22:26.559 --> 00:22:32.799
Well, like Paul, we too can always rejoice despite unpleasant circumstances when we grow in faith

00:22:33.279 --> 00:22:40.799
and seek true joy. We too seek joy that's not merely the result of what happens around us or

00:22:40.799 --> 00:22:49.920
what happens to us. When we pray earnestly for God's spirit, he helps us to succeed and to keep

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:58.000
our deep inner joy no matter what trial we may face. Even more than this, we have Jehovah's example

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:05.599
to imitate. He has maintained his joy despite much heartache. What has he endured?

00:23:07.279 --> 00:23:14.799
Well, over a period of about 4,000 years, Jehovah saw a number of angels rebel against his sovereignty.

00:23:15.839 --> 00:23:23.200
He saw Adam and Eve rebel. He watched wickedness spread across the earth. He saw false worships

00:23:23.279 --> 00:23:31.359
bread, and this included what his chosen people the Israelites did as they reverted again and again

00:23:31.359 --> 00:23:40.160
to apostasy. Finally, Jehovah saw his enemies, put his son to death. But through it all,

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:47.519
though unimaginably painful for him, Jehovah never lost his deep-seated joy. In fact,

00:23:47.519 --> 00:23:56.079
imagine his joy as he watched the vast majority of the angels keep their integrity. Imagine his

00:23:56.079 --> 00:24:04.480
joy as he watched faithful Israelites keep their integrity even when faced with death. And imagine

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:11.519
Jehovah's joy as he saw thousands turn to following his son and become true Christians,

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:20.480
a number that today reaches into the millions. Jehovah has always been able to see the light

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:26.720
beyond the storm. May we imitate the happy God and count our blessings every day,

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:34.480
even during the most difficult times. To help us to do this, we have an entire convention

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:42.480
now to enjoy all of its centered on the thought of always rejoicing. This convention includes talks,

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:50.160
symposiums, interviews, a Bible drama, and many videos that will teach us how to cultivate

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:56.960
and display joy of Holy Spirit. Please look at the convention program and let's see what's in

00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:03.920
store for us. Our scriptural theme for the first day is also our convention theme scripture

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:12.240
Philippians 4-4, which again says, always rejoice in the Lord. Again, I will say rejoice.

00:25:13.599 --> 00:25:20.480
We have so much to look forward to during the first day of this program. For instance,

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:27.039
the opening symposium will show that it's Jehovah's advice not the world's wisdom that brings true

00:25:27.039 --> 00:25:33.359
joy when we follow it. Then the dramatic Bible reading will help us to visualize the events

00:25:33.359 --> 00:25:40.960
recorded in the book of Ezra. After that, we will enjoy a faith strengthening review of how in the

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:50.079
past, Jehovah saved his people as a group and as individuals. During this critical time,

00:25:51.119 --> 00:25:58.960
it's important for us to take to heart what we will hear in that talk entitled rejoice in Jehovah's

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:06.960
Acts of Salvation. In the afternoon session, the second symposium of the day will explain how the

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:15.920
joy in a family is enhanced when each member appreciates and cherishes the others. The last symposium

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:22.559
of the day will show how creation provides convincing proof that Jehovah wants us to enjoy life.

00:26:23.359 --> 00:26:29.200
This will be followed by a talk that will discuss how we can find more peace and more joy

00:26:29.839 --> 00:26:37.039
by avoiding jealousy and competition. Finally, the first day concludes with a talk that will show us how

00:26:37.039 --> 00:26:45.039
those who truly know Jehovah are optimistic, they are generous and patient. As with each part of

00:26:45.039 --> 00:26:53.119
this convention, listen carefully to this talk entitled Close Friendship with Jehovah brings the

00:26:53.119 --> 00:27:01.039
greatest joy. We now look ahead to the second day of our convention program. The scriptural theme is

00:27:01.039 --> 00:27:08.400
based on Psalm 105, verse 3, and there in verse 3 we are encouraged to boast about his holy name,

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:16.960
let the hearts of those seeking Jehovah rejoice. One important way to boast about Jehovah's

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:24.480
holy name is by means of our disciple making work. Tying that in with our convention theme,

00:27:25.119 --> 00:27:31.920
the first symposium of the day will leave no doubt that our joy increases as our skills in the

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:39.759
disciple making work improve. Following this, the second symposium will show how we can find joy

00:27:39.759 --> 00:27:46.559
in the ministry when we rely on the help that God gives us for this work. The baptism talk

00:27:47.519 --> 00:27:54.079
will help those soon to get baptized to keep in mind what they need to do in order to be happy

00:27:54.079 --> 00:28:01.359
now and forever. In the afternoon portion of the second day's program, you will hear experiences

00:28:01.359 --> 00:28:07.599
during a series of videos that will make you proud to be part of our international brotherhood

00:28:07.599 --> 00:28:15.200
of disciple makers. The last symposium of day two will focus on ways you can help your Bible

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:22.160
students to overcome their fears and experience Jehovah's help and his blessings. This will be

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:30.640
followed by a convention highlight. Part one of the Bible drama, The Joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:37.839
After that faith strengthening drama, we will enjoy the final talk of the second day entitled

00:28:38.559 --> 00:28:46.160
Making Disciples Now, prepares us for new world disciple making. This talk will help to increase

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:53.279
our enthusiasm not only for the disciple making work of today, but also for that yet to come.

00:28:53.359 --> 00:29:02.079
Now we go to the final day of our program. With a scriptural theme taken from Psalm 37 verse 4,

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:10.880
the final day focuses our attention on what lies at the heart of true joy. Psalm 37 4 says,

00:29:11.519 --> 00:29:17.759
Find exquisite to light in Jehovah and he will grant you the desires of your heart.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:27.279
With Jehovah as our focus, we start the day with a seven-part symposium that will highlight how we

00:29:27.279 --> 00:29:35.279
can endure trials with joy. Afterward, during the public Bible discourse, the speaker will explain

00:29:35.279 --> 00:29:43.920
what riches God promises and how they can be obtained. In the concluding session of our convention,

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:51.279
we will be delighted to watch the thrilling climax of the Bible drama The Joy of Jehovah is your

00:29:51.279 --> 00:29:59.119
stronghold. Then the convention program will conclude with the talk, find exquisite to light in

00:29:59.119 --> 00:30:07.440
Jehovah. We will all benefit as the speaker reviews what helps us now and what we have to look

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:15.359
forward to in the future. Would you like to see a preview of the many videos we will enjoy at

00:30:15.359 --> 00:30:25.420
this convention? We thought so. Let's watch. I tried to look for work, but I was unsuccessful.

00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:33.420
It was a struggle even to get water. And the specialist gave us diagnosis of a very aggressive

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:40.619
brain tumor. My negative disposition made me a very impatient, sarcastic and demanding person.

00:30:41.259 --> 00:30:45.019
The fact that I was not appointed as an elder made me feel disappointed.

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:53.420
Jehovah will act in the near future fulfilling all his promises and so I'm happy to enjoy.

00:30:54.619 --> 00:31:01.660
And when everything around you is chaotic, the one thing you have is your relationship with Jehovah.

00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:10.859
Re-gaining joy is a work in progress. I have always admired the beauty and power of the sea.

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:18.539
It reminds me that the one who created the sea, it's not hard for him to care for just one small

00:31:18.539 --> 00:31:30.640
human like me. What a wonderful preview. We have so many blessings to appreciate and to draw

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:38.559
strength from. Yes, enjoy the blessings of cultivating joy of Holy Spirit. From this opening

00:31:38.559 --> 00:31:45.039
discussion, it's clear that godly joy does not come from random events nor does it come from

00:31:45.039 --> 00:31:52.960
this world. Rather, godly joy, true joy is an aspect of the fruitage of God's Holy Spirit.

00:31:54.079 --> 00:31:59.039
What will be one of the many blessings that we will experience if we continue to rejoice?

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:06.640
The answer, which this convention will highlight, is found at 2 Corinthians chapter 13 and verse 11.

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:14.160
Please read it along with me. 2 Corinthians 13 and verse 11. It says,

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:23.200
Finally, brothers, continue to rejoice, to be readjusted, to be comforted, to think in agreement,

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:28.720
to live peaceably, and the God of love and of peace will be with you.

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:37.359
So, if you continue to rejoice in serving Jehovah, what is the promise? The promise is that the

00:32:37.359 --> 00:32:45.920
God of love and of peace will be with you. With that in mind, let's be determined to always rejoice.

00:32:46.559 --> 00:32:51.039
In turn, Jehovah, the happy God will always be with us.
