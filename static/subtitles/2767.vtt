00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.969
What Bible principles could help a couple to decide

00:00:05.969 --> 00:00:08.970
whether to serve alcohol at their wedding?

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.970
What principles and scriptures do you think

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.970
would help them make a balanced decision?

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.969
Again, you're welcome to pause the program

00:00:18.969 --> 00:00:20.969
and if you'd like to write down what comes to mind

00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:24.500
or to research something.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.500
Now, your list probably has some of these principles.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.500
At John chapter 2 and verse 9, Jesus made wine for a wedding.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.500
However, 1 Corinthians chapter 6 and verse 10 says

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.500
that drunkards will not inherit the kingdom.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.500
And 1 Corinthians 10, 31 and 32 says,

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.500
whether you're eating or drinking,

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.500
do all things for God's glory,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.500
and to keep from becoming causes for stumbling.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.500
Now, it doesn't seem that any one principle

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.500
provides the answer.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.500
The couple could simply say,

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.500
if Jesus served wine at a wedding, so can we do?

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.500
However, there's really more to it than that, isn't there?

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.500
It's clear that a balance

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.500
of all these Bible principles is needed.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.500
Will relatives or others be there

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.500
who might be prone to over drinking?

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.500
Would serving alcohol bother the conscience of many present

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.500
because of local customs and feelings about alcohol?

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.500
It's often the case when making decisions

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.500
that we need to balance several Bible principles

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.500
not taking any one principle solely on its own merit.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.500
Jehovah expects us to use our power of reason

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.500
to balance Bible principles and make good decisions.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.500
Ecclesiastes chapter 7 and verses 16 through 18

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.500
gives us good advice about being balanced.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.500
Do not be overly righteous,

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.500
nor show yourself excessively wise.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.500
Why should you bring ruin to yourself?

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.500
Do not be excessively wicked nor be foolish.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.500
Why should you die before your time?

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.500
It is best to grasp one warning

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.500
without letting go of the other,

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.500
for the one who fears God will heed them both.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.500
How true.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.500
Such balance between extremes

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.500
is often necessary when we apply Bible principles.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.500
We need to heed them both, so to speak.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.500
We need to balance all the Bible principles

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.500
so we can come to the decision

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.500
that would show love of God and love of neighbor.
