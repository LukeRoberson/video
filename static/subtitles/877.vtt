00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:10.949
Especially at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and also as the war in Ukraine started,

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:14.310
I watched a great deal of news reports.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:23.629
Whether on TV, the computer on my smartphone, when you watch the news, you see many pictures

00:00:23.629 --> 00:00:26.469
that simply haunt you.

00:00:26.469 --> 00:00:30.989
I noticed that this was not good for me.

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:32.950
And it bothered me more and more.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.390
Besides, it was too time-consuming.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:42.109
After a while, you began to realize that you are somehow consumed by your thoughts.

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:46.630
I realized that it was not simply information that I was processing, but my feelings were

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.950
stirred.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.549
And how easily you can lose focus.

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:54.070
You don't notice it straight away.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:00.750
But I realized that for me, it was simply too much news.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.469
The only solution was to be occupied with Jehovah's news.

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:10.629
The news, which is good for me, Jehovah's promises.

00:01:10.629 --> 00:01:17.109
What really helped me was to focus on strengthening my trust in Jehovah and concentrating more

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:19.310
on the preaching work.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:26.939
It brought me closer to Jehovah and gave me inner peace and calm.

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.260
Many people think their future depends on what they see in the news.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:38.219
However, it does us so much good to help others understand that their future depends on something

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:41.659
completely different that is Jehovah's Kingdom.

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.579
And as a result, a wonderful future awaits them.
