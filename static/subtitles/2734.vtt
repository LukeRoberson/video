00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:08.449
Let's consider some outstanding prophecies about Jesus and their fulfillment.

00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:15.449
One was that He would be born of the tribe of Judah from the family of David, the son of Jesse.

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:24.449
More than 700 years before Jesus was born, Micah foretold in chapter 5 that He would be born in Bethlehem.

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.449
The prophecy speaks of Bethlehem Ephrathus.

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:33.450
Why is the designation Ephrathus important?

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.450
Because there existed another Bethlehem in the territory of Zebulun.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:47.450
It has been identified with Bidlam about seven miles or 11 kilometers west northwest of Nazareth.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.450
Again, the prophecy was extremely specific.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:57.450
And amazingly, I say a prophesied He would be born of a virgin.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.450
What human would ever think of such a thing?

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:10.450
Daniel chapter 9 foretold that the Messiah would arrive 483 years after the command to rebuild Jerusalem.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:17.450
This proved to be true in the year 29 of our common era, when Jesus was baptized.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:24.450
Zechariah chapter 11 foretold that the Messiah would be betrayed for 30 pieces of silver.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.450
Chapter 12 says that His body would be pierced.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:37.450
It was foretold that the Messiah would die a sacrificial death for our sins and be buried in the tomb of a rich man.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:47.760
Furthermore, prophecy proclaimed that He would be in the grave for parts of three days and then be resurrected.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:56.760
What about the argument that Jesus deliberately arranged matters so that the events in His life would fit all these prophecies?

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:05.760
What do you think? Could Jesus have arranged to be born of the tribe of Judah in the town of David's birth, Bethlehem?

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:17.759
His mother Mary lived in Nazareth. Could He tell her while in the womb, please take me to Bethlehem because the Scripture say, I must be born there?

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:23.759
Obviously, the very start of His life on earth was beyond His control.

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:31.759
Furthermore, could Jesus have arranged for the priests to pay Judas the 30 pieces of silver to betray Him?

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:35.759
Could He have arranged that His enemies bid in His face?

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:40.759
That the Roman authorities sentenced Him to be nailed to a stake?

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:43.759
That the soldiers cast lots for His garments?

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:51.759
Or that while piercing His sight with His spear, they not follow the custom of breaking any of His bones?

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:57.759
Could the prophecies just mention have been fulfilled by mere chance?
