00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:09.259
We will enjoy the next part now by brother Jeffrey Winder, a member of the governing body,

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:14.900
and his theme is Qualified for What?

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.899
Many in the world highly value a university education.

00:00:19.899 --> 00:00:26.899
And one reason is because it can qualify them for a desired profession, such as a doctor,

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:31.370
or a lawyer, or an engineer.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.369
What does your Gilead training qualify you to do?

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:40.869
To answer that question, let's look at the example of Jesus Christ,

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:47.869
because isn't it true Jesus received extensive training for his important assignment that he would have on the earth?

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:56.869
And in John 828, he said, just as the father taught me, I speak these things.

00:00:56.869 --> 00:01:06.870
Well, certainly the training that Jehovah gave to Jesus prepared him to know what to accomplish when he was on earth with his assignment.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.870
And so there was fulfilling scores of prophecies.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:16.870
There is the selection and training of his disciples, making Jehovah's name and personality manifest,

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:25.870
and of course, laying down his life as a sacrifice which would sanctify Jehovah's name and provide a way for salvation to man.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:36.870
But the training Jesus received not only prepared him to know what to do with his assignment, but also how to carry it out,

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.870
and this is really the focus of our talk.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:50.700
Read with me please, our key scripture in the book of Matthew, chapter 20, in verse 28.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:58.700
This reveals really the attitude, the approach that characterized everything that Jesus did on earth.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:14.699
Matthew 2028, just as the son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life as a ransom in exchange for many.

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:26.699
Jesus came to minister. His training prepared him to minister to others, and that humble approach characterized his entire ministry.

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:31.699
It permeated everything that he did on earth.

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:33.699
Consider a couple of examples.

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:40.699
First, he preached and taught others even when he was tired and exhausted.

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:44.699
One example is in the book of John. I invite you to turn there with me.

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:50.199
John, chapter 4, in verses 6 and 7.

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:57.199
So Jesus and his disciples are on the way to Galilee, and they take this route through Samaria, and Jesus is there.

00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:03.199
They stop at the well, and he sends the disciples off to get food, and we pick up the account, John 4, 6.

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:05.199
In fact, Jacob's well was there.

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:13.199
Now Jesus, tired out as he was from the journey, was sitting at the well.

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:16.199
It was about the sixth hour.

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:26.199
Now, interestingly, the Bible indicates that this is the only, or the study note indicates that this is the only place in the scriptures where Jesus is said to be tired out.

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:30.199
Now that's more than just tired. He was spent, wasn't he?

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:36.199
But what happens? Verse 7, a woman of Samaria came to draw water.

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:38.199
What would Jesus do?

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:40.199
Here we see him in the illustration.

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:44.199
Would he take a pass? How witness to the next one? I am just exhausted.

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:48.199
No. He ministered to her.

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:54.199
Please, give me a drink. He says, and that we know leads into a wonderful witness that he gave to her.

00:03:54.199 --> 00:04:00.199
It leads to them staying there for a couple of days and witnessing to others and many become believers in that area.

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:06.199
He ministered to others even when he was tired out.

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:14.199
Now the other account that might come to your mind when you think about Jesus teaching others when he was tired is the account in Mark 6.

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:22.199
We won't read it, but we remember this is when the 12 apostles had just come back from a preaching campaign, and they're excited, but understandably tired.

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:30.199
In fact, Mark 6.31 says that they were so busy, there were so many people coming and going that they didn't even have time to eat a meal.

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:37.199
Now interestingly, it was also around the same time that Jesus learns about the death of John the Baptist.

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:44.199
So understandably, he recommends to his disciples, let's go to a lonely place and let's get a bit of rest.

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:46.199
But what happens?

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:55.199
The crowd finds out where they're going, runs ahead of them, and is waiting for Jesus asking for more when they arrive at the other side of the shore.

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:03.199
Well, what would Jesus do? He's tired, he's hungry, he's grieving, but he ministers to them.

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:08.199
Mark 6.34 says he started to teach them many things.

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:17.199
The parallel account in Luke 9 says he received them kindly, so he truly ministered to them even when he was tired.

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:23.199
Here's a second way, we see Jesus ministering to others throughout his ministry.

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:28.199
He kept patiently teaching his disciples.

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:34.199
His disciples were a little slow to grasp, some important lessons weren't they?

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:39.199
How often did they argue over which one of them seemed to be the greatest?

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:46.199
Yet Jesus never gave up on him, he never lost his temper, never raised his voice, never berated them,

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:51.199
but instead he kept looking for new ways to teach them this important lesson.

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:56.199
Up until the night before his death, what did he do? Turn to John 13.

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:03.639
John 13 verses 4 and 5 at the evening meal.

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:08.639
He says he got up from the evening meal and laid aside his outer garments.

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:12.639
After taking a towel, he wrapped it around his waist.

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:18.639
After that, he put water into a basin and started to wash the feet of the disciples,

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:23.639
and to dry them off with the towel that was wrapped around him.

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:27.639
Here we see in our image, Jesus doing this remarkable feat.

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:30.639
The study note says this was the slave's job.

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:35.639
The slave would have normally done this, but here he takes that towel, he wraps the towel around him,

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:39.639
girds himself essentially, he puts on the slave's apron, doesn't he?

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:43.639
And he washes their feet one after the other.

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:46.639
He truly ministered to them.

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:49.639
And in verse 15, he says,

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:55.639
I set the pattern for you that just as I did to you, you should also do.

00:06:55.639 --> 00:07:00.639
So this is the pattern that they too should minister to others.

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:04.639
Now finally, in a superlative expression of his love,

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:09.639
he surrendered his life as a ransom for sinful mankind.

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:14.639
And here we see him on the stake, a torturous death, a pain that ransom.

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:17.639
Like our theme scripture says, the Son of Man came to minister

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:22.639
and to give his life a ransom in exchange for many.

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:27.639
Could anyone minister in a greater way than that?

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:31.639
Millions, perhaps billions, will inherit everlasting life

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:36.639
because of Jesus ministering to others in such a self-sacrificing way.

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:41.050
Jesus came to minister.

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:45.050
His training prepared him to minister to others,

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:50.050
and we see that humble approach of serving others and everything that he did.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:54.420
So now we come back to our original question.

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:59.420
What did your Gilead training prepare you to do?

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.420
You know the answer.

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:04.420
It prepared you to be ministers.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.420
So how can you do that?

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:12.420
When you arrive at your assignment, how can you use the things that you learned in Gilead to that end?

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:18.420
When you arrive at your assignment, how can you show the friends that you have come to minister?

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:22.420
Well, to answer that question, let's first talk to the sisters.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:28.420
How can you put on your slaves apron and minister to others in your assignments?

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.420
We'll consider two ways.

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:34.419
The first way is by your example.

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:38.419
Isn't it true we don't often know when someone is observing us

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:44.419
or our example is instructing or encouraging or helping others.

00:08:44.419 --> 00:08:47.419
And yet it is a powerful way to minister to others.

00:08:47.419 --> 00:08:52.419
Let's look at an example in the book of Mark chapter 12.

00:08:52.419 --> 00:09:00.269
Mark chapter 12, and we'll look at this account in verses 41 through 44.

00:09:00.269 --> 00:09:05.259
So it's the final week of Jesus' life.

00:09:05.259 --> 00:09:10.259
And he goes to the temple in beginning Mark 12, 41.

00:09:10.259 --> 00:09:13.259
He sat down with the treasury chests in view.

00:09:13.259 --> 00:09:17.259
And began observing how the crowd was dropping money into the treasury chests.

00:09:17.259 --> 00:09:20.259
And many rich people were dropping in many coins.

00:09:20.259 --> 00:09:27.259
Now a poor widow came and dropped in two small coins of very little value.

00:09:27.259 --> 00:09:30.259
So he called his disciples to him and said to them,

00:09:31.259 --> 00:09:38.259
truly I say to you that this poor widow put in more than all the others who put money into the treasury chests.

00:09:38.259 --> 00:09:43.259
For they all put in out of their surplus, but she, out of her want,

00:09:43.259 --> 00:09:48.259
put in everything she had, all she had to live on.

00:09:48.259 --> 00:09:53.259
Well the example of that poor widow encouraged Jesus,

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:57.259
but also provided a lesson that he could use to teach his disciples.

00:09:57.259 --> 00:10:04.259
And then by including it in God's word, it instructs everyone who would read the Bible in the future.

00:10:04.259 --> 00:10:05.259
But you think about the widow.

00:10:05.259 --> 00:10:07.259
Here we have her in the picture.

00:10:07.259 --> 00:10:10.259
Did she know that the son of God was observing her?

00:10:10.259 --> 00:10:11.259
Likely not.

00:10:11.259 --> 00:10:13.259
We don't know, but often we don't notice that.

00:10:13.259 --> 00:10:16.259
But here he was observing her.

00:10:16.259 --> 00:10:20.259
But this certainly isn't why she did what she did.

00:10:20.259 --> 00:10:23.259
She wasn't doing it because well maybe the son of God will see me.

00:10:23.259 --> 00:10:25.259
Rather she was a spiritual person.

00:10:25.259 --> 00:10:28.259
And so she did the right thing for the right reason.

00:10:28.259 --> 00:10:34.259
In her mind it was her privilege and her responsibility to contribute toward Jehovah's work.

00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:37.259
And so he did what was right.

00:10:37.259 --> 00:10:45.259
Well the fact was though that Jesus was observing her and he could use her example to teach others.

00:10:45.259 --> 00:10:51.259
Well similarly you may not know when your example is being observed by others.

00:10:51.259 --> 00:10:53.259
But you are spiritual women.

00:10:53.259 --> 00:10:58.259
And so you do the right thing for the right reason whether people observe you or not.

00:10:58.259 --> 00:11:03.259
But invariably as you follow this course day by day,

00:11:03.259 --> 00:11:09.259
humble ones will observe your example and they will benefit from it.

00:11:09.259 --> 00:11:12.259
And it may be even a little thing.

00:11:12.259 --> 00:11:17.259
Like even if they just happen to see you stoop down and pick up a little trash

00:11:17.259 --> 00:11:21.259
that fell in the hallway on accident someone didn't notice and you stopped to pick it up.

00:11:21.259 --> 00:11:25.259
Or maybe when you steer the conversation to the positive.

00:11:25.259 --> 00:11:30.259
Maybe they'll see you take an interest in others when they know that you're tired

00:11:30.259 --> 00:11:33.259
or they see you support your husband without complaining.

00:11:33.259 --> 00:11:38.259
Whatever it may be the friends might notice these things and benefit from your example.

00:11:38.259 --> 00:11:43.259
And it really is a powerful way that you can minister to others.

00:11:43.259 --> 00:11:47.570
Here's a second way that you can minister to others.

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:50.570
And this is by your words.

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:58.570
Now speaking of the capable wife, Proverbs 31 in verse 26 says this.

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:06.620
Proverbs 31, 26, she opens her mouth in wisdom.

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:10.620
The law of kindness is on her tongue.

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:16.620
Isn't that beautiful to think that our speech could be marked by wisdom and kindness.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:22.620
But the truth is, mature spiritual sisters are known for their kind, insightful advice.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:27.620
And I think every one of us could cite examples in our life of mature sisters

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:35.620
who helped us along the way with their interest in us and their sharing their insightful words of guidance.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:40.620
And when we think about women like that, we can't help but think about Abigail.

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:47.620
So here she is humbly on her knees before David speaking words of wisdom to him.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:53.620
She's using principles that she gleaned from the law and helped him to see that his actions,

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:56.620
if he moved forward, would incur blood guilt.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:02.620
She also tactfully reminded him that Jehovah had anointed him to be the future king of Israel.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:08.620
So he wouldn't want anything to solely his record or to cause him regret.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:18.620
And even in David's emotionally charged state, her words of wisdom made him stop in his tracks and change his course.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:24.620
Well, how can you use words to minister to others like that?

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:29.620
Well, it's not uncommon in talks like this at Gilead that were reminded.

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:34.620
You may not want to quote Gilead all the time that in Gilead we learn this and Gilead we learn that.

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:37.620
And we know that you won't do that. We understand why.

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:43.620
But the fact is, your Gilead training has deepened your well of good things to share.

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:50.620
And so humbly after listening, you may find opportunities where you can share these good things with others.

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:57.620
And it's often those informal, spontaneous one-on-one conversations where we get an opportunity to do this.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:06.620
And maybe they crop up at work or in the hallway on the way home from work or between doors in the ministry or before and after the meetings at the Kingdom Hall,

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:12.620
where we can just take the time and listen to others, listen to what is on their hearts and mind.

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:18.620
And then we just, not preach to them, we just share Jehovah's thinking on the matter at hand.

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.620
And that has a tremendous impact.

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:27.620
We truly love you, sisters, for your kindness and your spiritual insight.

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:32.620
It really is a beautiful way that you can minister to others.

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:38.620
So those are two ways our sisters can minister to others by your example and by your words.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:40.620
Now what about you, brothers?

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:47.620
How can you put on your slave's apron and minister to others in your assignment?

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:51.620
Well, certainly all the things that we said to the sisters would apply to you as well.

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:55.620
You can minister to others by your example and your words as well.

00:14:55.620 --> 00:15:01.620
But Jehovah has also determined to use the brothers in positions of oversight to take the lead in his organization.

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:09.620
So when you arrive to your assignment, likely you will have some responsibility or oversight in your work.

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:17.620
But as Jesus example taught us, those in authority should also be ministers.

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:25.620
So how can you use your Gilead training then to minister to others the way you carry out your assignment?

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:27.620
Here are two ways.

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:33.620
The first way, approach your assignment as a shepherd.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:36.620
Approach your assignment as a shepherd.

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:42.620
David set a fine example in this way because David, as a young shepherd boy in the field,

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:47.620
learned many things that would become very useful to him later in life and in his service to Jehovah.

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:49.620
He learned how to play the harp.

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:50.620
He learned how to use the sling.

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.620
He learned how to live outdoors.

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:58.620
But notice how his time as a shepherd affected his approach to the kingship.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:01.620
Turn with me, please, to the book of Psalms.

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:06.620
And that's read Psalm 78 verses 70 through 72.

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:13.419
Psalm 78, 70 through 72.

00:16:13.419 --> 00:16:22.700
He chose David his servant and took him from the sheep pins, from tending the nursing use.

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:30.700
He made him the shepherd over Jacob, his people, and over Israel, his inheritance.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:37.700
He shepherded them with integrity of heart and with skillful hands, he led them.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:40.700
So in time, David did become king, didn't he?

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:44.700
He was given theocratic authority over all of the people of Israel.

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:47.700
But he didn't approach that assignment as a dictator.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:53.700
He never lorded it over the people of Israel, rather he approached it as a shepherd.

00:16:53.700 --> 00:17:02.700
And he viewed those precious sheep as just that sheep who needed to be fed and protected and cared for.

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:04.700
And it characterized his kingship, didn't it?

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:10.700
The verse says that he shepherded with integrity of heart and with skillful hands.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:14.700
He truly ministered to them.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:20.700
Like David, minister to those whom you oversee.

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:24.700
Approach your assignment as a shepherd.

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:32.700
And when they sense that you are truly concerned about their well-being, about their workload, about their training,

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:41.700
when they see you often because you get out of your office and you visit them regularly and you shepherd them, then they will feel secure.

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:49.700
They will know that they have an overseer who loves them and is watching out for them and they will find joy in their assignment.

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:56.700
And they will even be able to endure a difficult work situation for a time because they know they have a way out.

00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:05.430
They know they have an overseer who is aware of their situation and is doing what he can to assist them.

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:09.430
Here is a second way that you can minister to those whom you oversee.

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:14.430
And that is by showing honor and respect for them.

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:17.430
Turn with me, please, to the book of Romans, chapter 12.

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:28.789
Romans 12, and let's read verse 10.

00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:37.789
Romans 12, 10, and brotherly love have tender affection for one another and showing honor to one another take the lead.

00:18:37.789 --> 00:18:42.789
Certainly, overseers should take the lead and showing honor to others.

00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:47.789
And truly, every servant of Jehovah deserves honor, isn't that true? And why?

00:18:47.789 --> 00:18:51.789
It's because they were created in Jehovah God's image.

00:18:51.789 --> 00:18:55.789
Each one is in a dedicated relationship with him.

00:18:55.789 --> 00:19:01.789
They are praying to Jehovah, Jehovah is listening to their prayers and answering their prayers.

00:19:01.789 --> 00:19:04.789
And also, the sheep belong to Jehovah, don't they?

00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:08.789
Purchased with the precious blood of his only begotten son.

00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:16.789
And at Bethel, we have an added reason to give them honor because each one has received his or her assignment from Jehovah.

00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:24.789
The friends in our department, this is their sacred service, this is their assignment given to them from Jehovah and they know it well.

00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:29.789
And so each one deserves respect and honor.

00:19:29.789 --> 00:19:35.789
Well, how will they sense that we truly honor them from the heart?

00:19:35.789 --> 00:19:43.789
They will sense it when we take note of their work and commend them frequently and sincerely.

00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:48.789
They'll sense it when we follow through on their requests promptly.

00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:53.789
And they'll sense it when we listen to their suggestions to improve the work.

00:19:53.789 --> 00:19:59.789
And when they do that, if they should suggest an improvement, it doesn't mean that they are challenging our authority.

00:19:59.789 --> 00:20:04.789
It doesn't mean that they're being presumptuous, it doesn't mean that we were doing it wrong before.

00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:09.789
Even Jehovah invited suggestions from his angels in the case of Ahab, didn't he?

00:20:09.789 --> 00:20:13.789
And he approved one of their suggestions.

00:20:13.789 --> 00:20:18.789
Well, in these and other ways, we can show honor to our workmates.

00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:21.789
We show them that we have come to minister.

00:20:21.789 --> 00:20:29.140
So what does your Gilead training qualify you, prepare you to do?

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:32.140
It prepares you to minister to others.

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:35.140
It's what characterized Jesus ministry.

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:38.140
May it characterize your service as well.

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:43.140
And as we learn, sisters can do that through your example and your words.

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:48.140
Brothers can do that in addition to that by approaching your assignment as a shepherd

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:55.140
and also by truly taking the lead in showing honor and respect to others.

00:20:55.140 --> 00:21:03.140
There's no doubt that Jesus was eager to show Jehovah that He benefited from the fine training that He received from Him.

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:07.140
And so not only did He do what Jehovah asked Him to do,

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:12.140
He carried it out in the way that Jehovah wanted Him to carry it out.

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:19.140
Well, we know that you too are eager to apply the good things that you learn in Gilead.

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:24.140
And so as you begin to think about maybe some of the things that you will do differently

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:30.140
when you arrive at your assignment, give close attention to how you will carry out your work.

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:34.140
Show that you have come to minister.

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:40.140
And when you do that, you will show that you truly benefited from your Gilead training.

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:47.140
The brothers will love you and above all, you will have the favor and approval of our God, Jehovah.

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:58.460
At this time, we will present the diplomas to the graduating class,

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:05.119
and Brother David Schaefer will assist me with this.

00:22:05.119 --> 00:22:10.119

Brother and sister Stoych, which will return to the Serbia branch.

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:24.549
All right, now would you like to see the entire...

00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:45.119
I'll give them a moment to be seated, 150th class of Gillian.

00:26:45.119 --> 00:26:47.619
So many people love you.

00:26:47.619 --> 00:26:51.019
And above all, Johova and his son love you very much.

00:26:51.019 --> 00:26:54.819
At this time, we would like to give our attention to Brother Marco Calcani

00:26:54.819 --> 00:27:04.519
from Croatia, who will read the class letter.

00:27:04.519 --> 00:27:09.720
To the governing body, dear brothers, we wish to thank you

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:15.720
for the immense privilege of attending the 155th class of Gillian.

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:19.019
From the day we received our invitation to attend the school,

00:27:19.019 --> 00:27:22.220
we felt as David did when he said,

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:24.519
Who am I, or Johova God?

00:27:24.519 --> 00:27:28.920
And what is my house that you have brought to me this far?

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:32.220
Over the past five months, we have seen and tasted

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:35.920
that there is no God like Johova.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:39.019
We are grateful to our great instructor, Johova,

00:27:39.019 --> 00:27:43.319
and great teacher Jesus Christ for the spirit of our instruction.

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:45.819
We are also grateful to our gearing instructors,

00:27:45.819 --> 00:27:49.920
who imparted by very selves day after day.

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:53.119
We will not soon forget the many lessons provided

00:27:53.119 --> 00:27:57.319
which highlighted the very goal to strengthen our faith.

00:27:57.319 --> 00:28:01.220
Through personalized teaching, advice, and counsel,

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:04.920
they became our mentors and friends.

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.519
During our deep study of God's Word,

00:28:07.519 --> 00:28:11.819
we were continually amazed by the beauty of Johova's qualities

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:15.920
and we were helped to see more clearly the Bible's breadth

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:20.019
and length and height and depth.

00:28:20.019 --> 00:28:24.119
From the time we arrived, we experienced the love, generosity,

00:28:24.119 --> 00:28:27.119
and hospitality of a better family.

00:28:27.119 --> 00:28:30.720
We quickly noticed where deep appreciation for spiritual matters

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:34.819
by their consistent interest in what we were learning.

00:28:34.819 --> 00:28:39.220
These brothers and sisters became beloved to us.

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:42.019
As we reflect on our time together, Gilead,

00:28:42.019 --> 00:28:44.420
we are filled with a deep sense of awe

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:47.819
for what we have learned, the memories created,

00:28:47.819 --> 00:28:51.819
and the friendships cultivated.

00:28:51.819 --> 00:28:54.819
Having you, dear brothers of a governing body

00:28:54.819 --> 00:28:58.519
and your helpers spend your precious time teaching us

00:28:58.519 --> 00:29:00.619
and getting to know us personally

00:29:00.619 --> 00:29:04.420
has made the deep and lasting impression.

00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:08.920
Your fellow feeling and humility were endearing.

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:11.720
More than ever, you are determined to work hard

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:15.019
to imitate your example of self-sacrifices love

00:29:15.019 --> 00:29:20.519
and crystal unity and to make Johova's heart rejoice.

00:29:20.519 --> 00:29:23.819
Some 106 verse 1 says,

00:29:23.819 --> 00:29:29.619
Praise Ja, give thanks to Johova for he is good.

00:29:29.619 --> 00:29:33.119
As we now come to the end of his incredible experience,

00:29:33.119 --> 00:29:35.319
we account to appreciate more and more

00:29:35.319 --> 00:29:38.619
how truly good Johova is to his servants

00:29:38.619 --> 00:29:42.920
and to experience his goodness like never before.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:45.720
We echo the words of a psalmist.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:49.119
We want, we will repay Jahova for all the good,

00:29:49.119 --> 00:29:51.220
yes, done for us.

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:52.920
We are determined to do good

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:55.019
and to strengthen, stabilize the branches

00:29:55.019 --> 00:29:58.420
and the field where we are assigned.

00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:00.720
Thank you for preparing us in this way

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:04.319
and for the confidence you have placed in us.

00:30:04.319 --> 00:30:06.619
We can only pray that each of us

00:30:06.619 --> 00:30:09.519
will live Gilead as a better servant to Johova

00:30:09.519 --> 00:30:11.819
than when we arrived.

00:30:11.819 --> 00:30:15.220
We love you from the bottom of our hearts

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:17.220
and we thank you for allowing us

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:21.519
a spirit to experience with theocratic milestone together.

00:30:21.519 --> 00:30:24.720
We have heartfelt love, your brothers and sisters

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:39.759
of a 150 feet class of Gilead.

00:30:39.759 --> 00:30:42.859
Well, thank you so much for that beautiful letter.

00:30:42.859 --> 00:30:44.359
We appreciate it.

00:30:44.359 --> 00:30:46.960
And also want to thank Brother Schaefer

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:49.660
who helped with the handing out of your diplomas.

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:53.160
And aren't you excited to have those in your hands now?

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:55.259
That's wonderful.

00:30:55.259 --> 00:30:58.759
Well, your schooling was designed to strengthen your faith

00:30:58.759 --> 00:31:02.259
and we're confident that it is done just that.

00:31:02.259 --> 00:31:06.259
Our faith keeps us strong to face what's ahead of us.

00:31:06.259 --> 00:31:08.759
At first John 5.4, the Apostle John wrote,

00:31:08.759 --> 00:31:12.160
this is the conquest that has conquered the world.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:15.859
You know it, our faith, right?

00:31:15.859 --> 00:31:18.559
We need very strong faith in the time

00:31:18.559 --> 00:31:21.359
that is yet ahead of us in this system of things.

00:31:21.359 --> 00:31:22.960
And our program today highlighted

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:25.359
a number of fine examples for us to imitate

00:31:25.359 --> 00:31:27.859
and doing just that.

00:31:27.859 --> 00:31:29.359
We show that we're strengthening our faith

00:31:29.359 --> 00:31:32.859
when we take time to care for our spiritual needs

00:31:32.859 --> 00:31:35.059
and caring for our spiritual needs

00:31:35.059 --> 00:31:38.660
always means caring for the basics first.

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:41.059
We can't neglect the basic things.

00:31:41.059 --> 00:31:44.859
Even though you have graduated from this beautiful school,

00:31:44.859 --> 00:31:47.660
the basics always count.

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:51.759
So be certain to attend Christian meetings regularly.

00:31:51.759 --> 00:31:54.059
We need the congregations.

00:31:54.059 --> 00:31:56.759
Brothers and sisters have thrived in the congregations

00:31:56.759 --> 00:31:59.460
for decades without ever serving at a branch,

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.460
without ever being in Bethel.

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:02.559
But there's no one in Bethel

00:32:02.559 --> 00:32:05.259
who can survive without the congregation.

00:32:05.259 --> 00:32:06.460
So we need it.

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:09.660
It's part of Jehovah's basic arrangement for us.

00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:11.960
That's part of what he does

00:32:12.059 --> 00:32:15.359
by means of Holy Spirit to keep us strengthened and encouraged.

00:32:15.359 --> 00:32:17.259
So give attention.

00:32:17.259 --> 00:32:18.759
Always to Christian meetings.

00:32:18.759 --> 00:32:20.059
We know you'll be busy,

00:32:20.059 --> 00:32:22.559
but keep in mind the basics.

00:32:22.559 --> 00:32:25.259
Also be certain to speak zealously to others

00:32:25.259 --> 00:32:27.759
about Jehovah's name and kingdom.

00:32:27.759 --> 00:32:29.160
We need the ministry.

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.059
Remember the basics.

00:32:31.059 --> 00:32:33.660
Also be certain to maintain strong faith

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:35.559
and trust in Jehovah.

00:32:35.559 --> 00:32:38.660
And a very important way we do that is through what means

00:32:38.759 --> 00:32:42.759
for personal prayers as we draw close to him

00:32:42.759 --> 00:32:45.859
and ask him to strengthen our faith.

00:32:45.859 --> 00:32:49.660
And he will do it for us as we do all these other things

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:52.660
to read his word every day

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:55.460
and apply its counsel and all that we do.

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:57.759
So you leave here with a treasure.

00:32:57.759 --> 00:33:00.359
It's not just the diploma you're holding in your hands.

00:33:00.359 --> 00:33:03.460
You have a treasure in your hearts and in your minds.

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:05.059
The things Jehovah has done for you,

00:33:05.059 --> 00:33:08.059
the experience you've had in the school.

00:33:08.059 --> 00:33:12.259
Yes, the instruction that has been so helpful.

00:33:12.259 --> 00:33:16.059
But remember that precious treasure

00:33:16.059 --> 00:33:18.660
will only remain with us or with you

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:21.059
as long as we stick to the basics.

00:33:21.059 --> 00:33:23.160
And Jehovah will bless you always for that.

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:25.059
He will love you for it

00:33:25.059 --> 00:33:27.960
because he sees that we're humble and we acknowledge

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:31.859
we need these basic things to keep going.

00:33:31.859 --> 00:33:33.759
So in summary,

00:33:33.759 --> 00:33:37.859
don't take liberties with your spiritual routine

00:33:37.859 --> 00:33:41.059
now that you've graduated from this wonderful school

00:33:41.059 --> 00:33:43.160
never become self-satisfied

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:46.960
because of receiving a privilege that you may enjoy.

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:50.359
There's so much more to learn and to do.

00:33:50.359 --> 00:33:53.859
The future holds endless and wonderful privileges

00:33:53.859 --> 00:33:55.859
for those who love Jehovah.

00:33:55.859 --> 00:33:57.460
So keep learning

00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:01.559
and keep growing as a spiritual person, a godly person

00:34:01.559 --> 00:34:04.059
and always trust in Jehovah

00:34:04.059 --> 00:34:06.960
who is so kind to all of us.

00:34:07.059 --> 00:34:08.159
He's kind to you.

00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:10.760
He's kind to all of those who love him

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:13.059
and do their very best in serving him

00:34:13.059 --> 00:34:14.960
and who rely on him.

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:18.059
And he will love you and bless you always for it.

00:34:18.059 --> 00:34:22.360
As you remain focused on what Gilead School has strengthened you to do,

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:24.760
you'll be ready to continue fighting

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:26.760
as 1 Timothy 612 says,

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:28.960
the fine fight of the faith.

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.460
And we have confidence that you will.

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:33.760
You'll be a blessing

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:35.460
to Jehovah's holy name,

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:36.860
adding to its honor,

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:39.659
but also to those with whom you will serve.

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:40.860
You will be a blessing

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:42.559
and they will love you for it

00:34:42.559 --> 00:34:44.159
and you will love them in return

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:46.760
and they will help you too.

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:48.659
May Jehovah and his dear son

00:34:48.659 --> 00:34:51.559
bless each of you always for it.

00:34:51.559 --> 00:34:53.260
We love you very much

00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:56.260
and we're so happy to see you at this point now.
