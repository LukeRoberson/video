00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:08.380
My family started studying with witnesses in New Jersey.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:15.179
My parents had been very diligent in helping us to appreciate not only Bible principles,

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.019
but characters in the Bible that could be a role model for us.

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:30.699
It helped us to know that Jehovah cared not only for adult publishers, but for the children

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.659
that we're serving him.

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:39.700
When you went out in the ministry, it became such a common thing.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.219
The police would come and pick you up.

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:47.299
If they couldn't track down the parents, they would put the children in jail knowing

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:52.140
that eventually the parents would have to come looking for them.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.259
The police would use scare tactics that said, there's rats in the cell.

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:01.140
Is that where you want to be?

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.739
Anything to make you fearful, to intimidate you, to tell them where your parents were.

00:01:08.739 --> 00:01:15.140
They'd put us in the jail and in order to build our faith, we would see.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.980
We didn't have kingdom melodies back then, so we used to make up songs.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:27.620
And that would keep us focused on what we were doing there.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:34.579
I reached the age of 18, my parents were agreeable to my accepting and assignment.

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:43.819
And in those years, because of the racial issue in the south, there were so many areas in

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:49.980
the south where they didn't have kingdom holes that the colored could attend.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:56.340
So if you were free and you would accept an assignment, this society usually sent us

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.819
to the south.

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:06.299
My parents were both born in the south, so they were able to tell us what to expect to

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.379
keep the culture shock from being so great.

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:19.060
I was assigned to pioneer in Andalusia, Alabama, based on all of the matters that pertain

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.219
to integration and segregation.

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:30.580
This was a hotbed for testing those issues.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:41.500
And so I was concerned about whether I had the fiber just to work under those circumstances.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.099
The field was wide open.

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:51.539
There were so many in the area that had no knowledge of Jehovah's Witnesses and very receptive

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:53.139
to the message.

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:57.659
That part of our ministry was very rewarding.

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:12.900
We had some very strong and helpful brothers that Jehovah was using to get his people, no

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.939
matter what color, to get them to appreciate him and his purpose.

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:24.819
When you focus on these things, the suggestions and the ideas that the brothers would help

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:31.900
you to appreciate, how to deal with issues that taught us for one thing.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.819
The whole purpose of the Club Club's clan is to intimidate.

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:43.939
They feel that if they frighten you enough, you will leave.

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:49.060
Satan has always used methods to try to intimidate.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.099
But we would make it a practice to stay, to hold our place.

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.860
We were in street work, we stay right there.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.460
And of course, as they passed, they had their remarks to make.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.819
But we just stood there.

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:11.419
And I think back on my youth, there isn't anything that I was able to participate in that

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:13.300
I came to regret.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.579
There were always blessings that went along with it.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:22.120
You make yourself available, Jehovah would use you.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.240
Jehovah is always there as a support.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:35.480
There isn't anything that he directs his organization to do that doesn't receive his support.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:44.199
So if we are challenged with a new assignment or if we feel inadequate about it, if we look

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:48.639
to Jehovah, with Jehovah, you can't fail.
