00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.699
Myanmar is a country made up of many remote tribes, tongues, and national groups.

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:20.699
Jehovah's Witnesses have been active here for over 100 years.

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.699
Yet, because Myanmar has been isolated for many decades,

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:31.699
there have been very few opportunities for the witnesses here to meet brothers and sisters from other countries.

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:44.280
However, in January 2014, international visitors from 15 countries joined around 4,000 witnesses

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:51.280
from every major tribe and ethnic group in Myanmar at a special convention of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:01:15.659
The special convention truly stood out as a testimony to our genuine brotherhood and unity.

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.659
We all believe that Jehovah God will bring about a new world.

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:35.299
This is not just a dream. We can already see it at our conventions, especially at the special convention just held in Myanmar.

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:43.299
When we saw the unity and love among the brothers and sisters, we felt like we were already in the new world.

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:52.989
From the moment the international delegates arrived at the Yangon Airport, the depth of our brotherhood was clearly evident.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.840
And we were watching the locals very carefully. You could see in their faces, in their eyes, how amazed they were.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.840
Here's all these foreigners coming into the country and being greeted by people as if they've been long lost friends for years.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.840
And we were thinking, what a wonderful shout of praise to Jehovah's name.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.840
The local brothers had prepared for months to attend the convention.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.840
To cover the travel expenses, as you can see, I'm breeding pigs.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:37.699
I have no regrets spending the money to go there because this convention is very important.

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:48.969
Some local publishers had to walk from their villages, then travel by bus and then on by train.

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:53.969
Some brothers and sisters had never been on a bus or train before.

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:57.969
So many got very carsick.

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:05.860
Then they arrived in Yangon.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.860
We are coming from far away and our health is not good. I'm already 70 years old.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.860
So I was thinking, should I go or not?

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:22.860
After traveling from far away by train, we arrived and met the brothers and sisters from far away.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.860
It wasn't easy to come here. We were carsick. It was horrible.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.460
But we are so happy to meet the brothers and sisters.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:43.460
As it turned out, the government officials who controlled the National Stadium were so appreciative of the work our organization did cleaning and repairing the stadium,

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.460
that they allowed nearly 2,000 brothers to sleep at the stadium for free.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:58.819
I also was impressed on the friends and their devotion to come here and the way that they had to sleep in here.

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:07.819
I felt very encouraged that for the United States that we can take that back to show how much gratitude they have for your whole life.

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:20.540
All of the congregations throughout Myanmar were assigned to serve as hosts for the international delegates at tours and gatherings prior to the special convention.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.540
Well, welcome in each place. It's so deep from their heart.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:37.540
And you just want to show them how much you do appreciate them being there to give you that welcome, to make you feel so apart of what everything is going on here.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:52.019
Each of the 135 ethnic groups in Myanmar has a different language and culture.

00:04:52.019 --> 00:05:06.660
At several tours and gatherings, the local and international delegates joined together to enjoy the various songs, dances, and experiences from Myanmar.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:18.709
The local brothers were so happy to share some of their unique culture with the visitors.

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:24.709
The evening gatherings also created opportunities for the brothers to associate in a relaxed setting.

00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:34.019
Getting to know different brothers from different areas has been a heartwarming experience for us.

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:42.019
Even though we can communicate our love story, it's a hiking experience. Herbs, hench, and the love story.

00:05:42.019 --> 00:05:43.019
Very happy.

00:05:43.019 --> 00:05:54.019
To see everybody together, not really knowing how to talk to each other, but still communicating with hugs, with smiles, and with handshakes and love.

00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:57.019
And that's how we communicate with love.

00:05:59.019 --> 00:06:08.129
I'm so happy that I came. I can't speak English with the foreigners, but we hug and greet. That makes me so happy.

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:14.129
A peak of 7,977 attended a special convention.

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:18.129
In a total of 213 were baptized.

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:27.860
Long before the baptism talk, the brothers will queue up, line up, and shake hands with the candidates.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:36.860
With everyone, we're very glad it takes a long time, and each one will say, one or two words to encourage the candidate.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.860
It's really nice to watch that. It's a very good question.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:48.860
And you will notice another thing, and the candidates will rest for the convention, and they get baptized every day.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.860
That's because they are very modest and very humble people.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:07:00.860
After the baptism, they put out the new convention rules, and ready for the rest of the sessions.

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:15.100
My two sons got baptized today. I'm so pleased.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:21.100
I feel like the happiness I am feeling is a gift from Jehovah.

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:28.100
We cannot do anything, but for Jehovah, all things are possible. He can do anything.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.100
I really crazed Jehovah.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:42.430
As the special convention drew to a close, both the local and international delegates were deeply moved by the experience they had shared.

00:07:45.959 --> 00:07:49.959
We are not yet in the new world, but that is how we feel.

00:07:49.959 --> 00:07:58.959
Because even though we are different nationalities and have different backgrounds, yet we are united and are so happy to associate together,

00:07:58.959 --> 00:08:00.959
really, it's like the new world.

00:08:00.959 --> 00:08:03.959
What impressed me the most was the local brothers.

00:08:03.959 --> 00:08:10.959
They've gone through so much, but yet they love Jehovah so much, and it's just really inspiring because I think back home,

00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:17.500
we took a lot of things for granted sometimes, but we can tell that they really do like Jehovah.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:28.500
I faced many challenges in my pioneer service, but after coming to this convention, I feel like all my problems have disappeared.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:33.500
So I have decided to use even more of my strength in God's service.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:40.500
And one of the sisters gave me a gift and she said it's a small gift, but big love.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.500
It's touching.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:52.500
The inspiration of seeing the friends in their quiet dignity, and there were some of them that didn't even understand a word of the convention,

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:57.500
yet they would travel five days to get here and five days back on bus.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:05.500
So it makes me want to take it back, and I've already prayed to Jehovah that I can use this to take it to action.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.500
And we really feel like we're living in paradise.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:15.500
We did not expect to get that way, and every day it seems like we're already there.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.840
Really happy and excited.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.840
There are so many brothers and sisters.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.840
I just feel like I don't want this to end.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.840
I feel like I'm in the new system.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.840
I'm so happy.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:34.590
Believe me, like I am in the new world.

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.590
I am so happy.

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:46.580
At the end of the special convention, everyone knew they had experienced something very special.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:56.580
Despite coming from different countries, language barriers, and contrasting cultures, we felt united as one brotherhood.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:02.580
We just wanted it to last forever, and we know one day it will.
