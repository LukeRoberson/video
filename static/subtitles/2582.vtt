00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:11.689
From ancient times, Jehovah has directed his people to build.

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:20.690
The joyful work of constructing and remodeling buildings to advance pure worship has continued in our time.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:29.690
But who could have anticipated the tremendous scale and need for today's worldwide building work,

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:37.689
requiring so many volunteers, tools, equipment, and often working in challenging situations.

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:44.689
With all this building comes the risk of accidents that can result in serious injury.

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:54.689
That's why we as Jehovah's people care deeply about protecting the lives and safety of all our fellow construction volunteers.

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:58.689
This is not a hypothetical consideration.

00:00:58.689 --> 00:01:04.689
Sadly, some of our brothers and sisters have experienced serious injuries while volunteering on projects.

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:13.689
Some of the most serious imaginable are global life, safety, and loss prevention guidelines clearly states.

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:19.689
Our goal is to have an accident-free environment with minimum loss.

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:30.689
This zero-accident goal can be accomplished if each one realizes that his attitude toward the life safety and loss prevention reflects his spirituality.

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.689
How can we accomplish this?

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.689
Let's consider three important aspects.

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:44.689
Our attitude toward our work, how we plan for it, and how we work to avoid potential danger.

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.689
First our attitude.

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:56.730
Proverbs 16-18 tells us pride is before a crash and a haughty spirit before stumbling.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:05.620
No matter how skilled or experienced we may be, we need to humbly follow safety direction.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:16.620
We also need to show modesty if we're inexperienced and let others train us properly before we begin to work with unfamiliar equipment.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:27.620
The easiest is 10-9 tells us the one who quarries stones may be hurt by them and the one who splits logs may be endangered by them.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.620
Many aspects of construction are inherently dangerous.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.620
This underscores our second aspect.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.620
We need to plan wisely.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.620
How can we plan for a safe work experience?

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.620
We have tools to help.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.620
The guideline working together safely provides standards for our construction and maintenance projects.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.620
It also reminds us of our personal responsibility.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.620
Are you familiar with its sound guidance?

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:06.620
Our job has our analysis forms for maintenance and construction help us anticipate potential safety risks.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:14.620
Let's examine just a few of the potential dangers it helps us to foresee in advance of working on a project.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:21.330
This pipe here has a leak and needs to be fixed.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.330
We're going to have to do a weld here I'm afraid.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.330
Well, we'll have to insulate this part here in between the wall and the pipe.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.330
Otherwise we'll end up creating a fire hazard here in the kingdom home.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.330
I see. Let me write that down.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:38.330
I was thinking too. We should assign someone to stand by with a fire extinguisher while the weld is being done.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:39.330
You're right.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:45.330
And also I think we should put someone on fire hazard duty to make sure nothing catches fire after the weld is done.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.330
I agree. Good idea.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.330
Perfect. I'll go ahead and make the assignments then.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.330
Okay. Let's do it.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:04:02.550
I think that here the brothers are going to need safety boots so that they don't slip and fall.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.550
They're also going to need safety harnesses since they'll be up pretty high.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.550
What do you think?

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.550
Do you remember if all the brothers assigned were trained to work with safety harnesses?

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.550
We're also going to need a support team to be ready to help in case of an accident.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:19.550
It would be best if we could have less people up on the roof.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.550
But it's impossible to inspect things from down here, right?

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.550
I have an idea.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.550
What if we put a camera on a long pole and do the inspection from down here?

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.550
We can check everything out from one end to the other.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.550
Okay. Great idea.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.550
This wise planning reflects the third aspect of achieving our zero accident goal.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:47.550
Pay close attention to direction so we can work to eliminate or avoid danger.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:05:03.860
When working on a large project or a smaller one, including maintenance work,

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:12.620
the right attitude, planning and actions will help keep our brothers and sisters safe.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.620
So remember the steps we can take to ensure safety.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.620
First, have Jehovah's view of things. Life is precious.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.620
Second, be wise and anticipate the potential hazards.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:34.620
And third, once you anticipate a risk, take precautions to remove or reduce it.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.620
Never forget how serious maintaining safety is.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:44.620
It demonstrates obedience to Jehovah and affects our relationship with him.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:51.620
While we're working on theocratic building projects, we cannot expect miraculous protection.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:57.620
Just as Jehovah wants us to exert ourselves in preaching to others to help save lives,

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:03.620
he requires us to work obediently to protect our fellow volunteers.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:09.620
Jehovah tells us in Proverbs, safeguard practical wisdom and thinking ability.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.620
They will give you life and be an adornment for your neck.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:19.279
And then you will walk on your way in safety.

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:30.279
Let us all act wisely and walk safely as we work together on Kingdom Hall projects and maintenance and construction projects.
