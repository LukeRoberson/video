00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.140
2020 was a year of unprecedented change.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.660
The coronavirus pandemic has taken a grim toll

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.660
around the world.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.059
In some parts of the world,

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:24.190
the coronavirus is beginning to spread more quickly.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.230
This global pandemic has thrown the world

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.409
into a state of uncertainty.

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:35.890
On a global scale, it was unlike anything

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.250
Jehovah's People had yet experienced in the 21st century.

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:43.969
Every day life from many of us

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.450
has been disrupted in ways we might never have imagined.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.689
We've made dramatic adjustments to our activities

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:55.490
all over the world.

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:00.689
Learn how to use new apps like Skype and Zoom.

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:01.329
What's that?

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.329
It changed how we attended meetings,

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:08.530
engaged in the ministry, and visited with friends.

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.450
For some of us, this may have been the very first time

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.370
we ever held a memorial in our home.

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:18.609
And although attending in smaller groups

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:21.010
may have been even closer to how the memorial

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.769
was observed in earlier times,

00:01:23.489 --> 00:01:25.890
for most modern-day servants of Jehovah,

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:29.489
this was likely a unique experience.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.299
Then, during the summer,

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.939
we enjoyed a full convention program

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.620
with talks delivered directly

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.859
from governing body members and their helpers.

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.060
And in most cases, again,

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.459
streamed right into our homes.

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:56.560
Yes, despite the various challenges

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.359
and difficulties experienced in 2020,

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:02.799
Jehovah's Organization continued undaunted,

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.439
providing the right food at the right time.

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:10.080
But why was this convention unlike any other

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.759
in our organization's history?

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.400
What were the challenges?

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:16.879
And most important, what had been the benefits?

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:24.819
On March 11th of 2020,

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.780
the World Health Organization made the assessment

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.379
that COVID-19 could be characterized as a pandemic.

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:34.259
At that point, we had no idea

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:36.979
as to what governments were going to do worldwide.

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:40.419
Would they allow our brothers to meet in kingdom halls?

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:44.259
Would they allow our brothers to meet in large venues?

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.419
We had no idea whatsoever.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.860
The governing body approved a letter to all branches

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.300
canceling all live conventions worldwide.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.939
And the idea was for us to pre-record a program

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:02.180
that could be used in any location around the world

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.539
so that they would at least have the program

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:07.060
of the regional convention.

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:10.900
We wanted to ensure that this spiritual food got out there

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.900
to all of our dear brothers and sisters.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.419
More important, we wanted to make certain

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:20.500
that this program went forward because it honors Jehovah.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.060
He's the source of the joy that we have.

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:25.780
So very quickly, speakers were each assigned

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:26.979
two convention ports.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.780
They had to prepare them and it was scheduled

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.379
to have all of these talks recorded

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.300
during the last two weeks of April.

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:38.500
Giving a talk at an open arena or at a large event,

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:41.620
you have the opportunity of getting feedback

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:42.580
from the audience.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.340
If you say something that impresses the audience

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.460
or makes them happy, seeing the smiling faces there,

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.979
somehow that really stirs up our presentation

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:55.780
and helps us to make it more lively and meaningful.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.659
But being in the basement of the office building,

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.379
looking at a camera with nobody else in the room,

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:07.219
knowing that it's just a couple of persons

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:09.139
recording it in another room,

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.300
certainly is a very different way to present a talk.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.420
And Jehovah has allowed us to endure this time of pandemic,

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.220
but he also had to know and were convinced he knew

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:28.899
that we could still make this always rejoice program happen

00:04:28.899 --> 00:04:32.019
because we would use the tools available to us

00:04:32.019 --> 00:04:34.500
and he would help us and that's exactly what we did.

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:41.980
Next, let's take a closer look

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.899
at some additional challenges faced

00:04:43.899 --> 00:04:45.420
once the talks were recorded.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.220
We had the opportunity to hear

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.300
from some of the departments involved.

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.060
Brothers, how did the team adapt to the challenges?

00:04:57.339 --> 00:05:00.139
Well, the reaction initially was we were very excited.

00:05:01.019 --> 00:05:02.620
We love to try new things

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.779
and this was a huge opportunity to do just that.

00:05:05.579 --> 00:05:07.259
But then as we had more meetings about it,

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:08.939
we found out what all was going to be involved.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.660
We suddenly got very nervous

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.660
because we found out about all the translation

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.819
and how soon everything had to be finished.

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:17.180
What impact did that have?

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.459
Audio video services had never produced

00:05:20.459 --> 00:05:23.180
an online program of this size before.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.379
You're talking an 18-hour online regional convention

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:28.620
that had to be produced in a very short time.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.740
In most years, we just translate the outlines

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.660
which are relatively easy

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.939
and then we translate all the convention videos and dramas.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.620
But this year, the translators not only had to do

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.019
that work of translating the videos,

00:05:43.019 --> 00:05:47.019
but they had to translate the scripts for each talk

00:05:47.019 --> 00:05:50.459
and then arrange for recording all of those talks.

00:05:50.459 --> 00:05:52.220
It was a tremendous amount of work.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.220
Some of us were saying,

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.500
can we postpone it?

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.540
Can we ask for to write back and say,

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.540
brothers, please, can we do it later?

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.060
Because we just thought it is impossible to do.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:08.939
The government in India had announced a complete lockdown.

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:10.939
So overnight,

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:12.939
where without our offices,

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:14.939
our computer equipment,

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:16.939
our recording studios,

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:19.740
the level of connectivity we would enjoy,

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.939
we felt like a carpenter

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:25.339
was also produced furniture

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:30.379
but has no access to his toolbox or his workshop.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.139
That is a lot to contend with.

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:37.579
What are some unique solutions

00:06:37.579 --> 00:06:41.420
that the teams came up with to meet those various challenges?

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.220
Well, there were amazing solutions.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.620
One of the things that impressed me was the recording studios

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.420
that were made.

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:58.589
Normally, the translators go into the RTO

00:06:58.589 --> 00:07:00.430
or the branch to do the recording,

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.670
but now they had to make hundreds of makeshift studios

00:07:04.829 --> 00:07:05.629
in their homes.

00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:09.310
I would translate to accomplish the work outside the branch

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.470
with the power coming in and out.

00:07:12.269 --> 00:07:14.910
Well, the brothers would wait

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:16.750
and as soon as the power comes,

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:18.350
they would start working.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:19.550
No matter what time it was,

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:20.829
what time was it in the day?

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:23.550
Our brothers were well-soddedicated

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.949
that they accomplished the work.

00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:27.629
Very touching.

00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:30.430
But our brothers who do sign language recordings

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.149
have to record in front of a camera.

00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:37.230
But they also needed to have, ideally, behind them,

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:42.750
a background that was bright green or bright blue

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:46.829
so that their signing could be superimposed onto another video.

00:07:47.709 --> 00:07:49.790
And so some brothers were able to get a cloth.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.350
Many of our brothers painted a wall in their house

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:56.350
this bright, chartreuse color.

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:57.870
admirable ingenuity.

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:58.829
Thank you.

00:07:58.829 --> 00:08:00.990
One of the most interesting solutions

00:08:01.069 --> 00:08:02.990
was that many of the translators

00:08:03.949 --> 00:08:06.350
around the world in different branches

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:08.910
would go into their car late at night

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:12.509
when all the noise had subsided in the neighborhood

00:08:12.509 --> 00:08:15.149
and they would do the recording inside the car.

00:08:15.149 --> 00:08:17.149
Thank you and everyone working with you

00:08:17.149 --> 00:08:18.910
for being so willing to adapt.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:23.709
In your opinion, what made all of this possible?

00:08:25.069 --> 00:08:26.829
Despite a global pandemic,

00:08:26.829 --> 00:08:28.430
despite a lockdown,

00:08:28.509 --> 00:08:31.149
none of those things matter to Jehovah's organization.

00:08:31.709 --> 00:08:34.350
What has shut down various other things

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:35.230
throughout the world

00:08:36.269 --> 00:08:38.590
proved to be no obstacle for Jehovah

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:40.029
in his earthly organization.

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:43.950
And what a beautiful thing it is to see this program

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:46.429
be something that's enjoyed by everyone worldwide.

00:08:47.629 --> 00:08:51.389
Here, despite the conditions going on in the world around us,

00:08:51.389 --> 00:08:53.389
Jehovah's people are moving forward.

00:08:54.029 --> 00:08:57.389
And you really see the fulfillment of Malachi 318

00:08:57.389 --> 00:09:00.110
where it says that you will see a distinction

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:03.230
between those serving Jehovah and those who don't.

00:09:04.029 --> 00:09:05.470
Everyone who had a part in this,

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:08.269
the thousands of brothers and sisters around the world

00:09:08.269 --> 00:09:12.350
who had a part in bringing these convention programs

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:13.309
to our brothers and sisters.

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.750
They're just normal people like you and I.

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:22.269
But Jehovah uses normal people to accomplish incredible things.

00:09:23.309 --> 00:09:26.190
This convention has been a landmark convention

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:28.909
because of the content and the beautiful theme.

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:32.909
But we'll also remember it for the way Jehovah

00:09:32.909 --> 00:09:36.350
helped us to produce it in so many languages

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:39.950
for our brothers and sisters in the country and around the world.

00:09:40.509 --> 00:09:42.590
Well, in translation, we like verbs.

00:09:43.789 --> 00:09:45.789
And in Jehovah's name, there's a verb.

00:09:46.669 --> 00:09:48.029
It causes to become.

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:52.590
This 2020 convention was approved

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:58.590
that Jehovah causes whatever he wants to become

00:09:58.590 --> 00:09:59.950
to accomplish his purpose.

00:10:00.669 --> 00:10:03.309
Because if there's a convention that Jehovah used

00:10:03.309 --> 00:10:06.669
to give glory to his name, this is it.

00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:10.429
What beautiful conviction.

00:10:10.429 --> 00:10:11.309
Thank you, brothers.

00:10:12.909 --> 00:10:15.549
Yes, Jehovah's Spirit helped ensure

00:10:15.549 --> 00:10:18.750
that the work was accomplished in spite of many challenges.

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:22.509
But what were some of the blessings experienced

00:10:22.509 --> 00:10:23.629
once the work was done?

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:32.259
Because the convention is being presented by means of video,

00:10:32.259 --> 00:10:34.820
it's possible to pause at any time when necessary.

00:10:35.379 --> 00:10:37.460
Just to go back a little bit to watch something

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:39.460
that maybe we didn't quite get.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.779
And maybe even because sometimes our minds drift.

00:10:42.419 --> 00:10:45.299
It's good because we can go back and rewatch it.

00:10:45.299 --> 00:10:47.940
And in this way, we get even more benefit from the program.

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:57.090
I cannot imagine a convention more international than this one.

00:10:57.809 --> 00:10:59.409
We saw how the brothers were able

00:10:59.409 --> 00:11:02.049
to make a difficult situation turn out well.

00:11:02.049 --> 00:11:03.649
That is, we're together.

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:07.169
Even if we're physically apart from each other,

00:11:07.169 --> 00:11:09.090
we are united at this convention.

00:11:20.019 --> 00:11:23.059
Volunteers were sent by the elders to travel

00:11:23.059 --> 00:11:26.419
and obtain the videos due to lack of internet in our village.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:32.529
We traveled about 46 kilometers on foot.

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:39.149
Sometimes we would leave early in the morning

00:11:39.149 --> 00:11:40.590
or late in the evening,

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:43.629
even traveling at night in order to obtain the videos.

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:46.269
But with Jehovah's blessing,

00:11:46.269 --> 00:11:48.509
we overcame all of these challenges.

00:11:57.409 --> 00:11:59.409
I lost my dearest wife

00:11:59.409 --> 00:12:01.889
about two months before the convention started.

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:03.649
It was cancer.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:07.889
We had been married for 14 years

00:12:07.889 --> 00:12:09.889
and she was only 47.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.240
She was my greatest partner in Jehovah's service.

00:12:16.799 --> 00:12:18.960
So this left me with a gaping hole.

00:12:26.929 --> 00:12:28.529
The theme of the convention,

00:12:28.529 --> 00:12:29.809
to always rejoice,

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:32.850
came just at the right time for me.

00:12:33.649 --> 00:12:36.210
I know it was Jehovah's wonderful gift to me.

00:12:37.409 --> 00:12:38.610
Through the convention,

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:42.289
I could see that Jehovah had sent all the members of the governing body

00:12:42.289 --> 00:12:44.370
and its helpers to me personally.

00:12:45.649 --> 00:12:47.970
I can't think of a better gift.

00:12:56.509 --> 00:12:59.149
I really enjoyed the audio description

00:12:59.149 --> 00:13:01.870
because I am someone who is legally blind.

00:13:02.669 --> 00:13:06.509
And the audio description just opened up a whole new world for me.

00:13:06.509 --> 00:13:09.629
Ben walks out of the room as his co-workers shape their heads.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.919
So it was really amazing to have the videos being described.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:25.279
And for me, I felt like I can now see what was happening.

00:13:25.279 --> 00:13:28.639
A lot of what the audio description described

00:13:28.639 --> 00:13:32.240
are things that I normally would have been curious about

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:35.759
and I would have been asking somebody to help me understand.

00:13:36.559 --> 00:13:38.799
I had tears in my eyes

00:13:38.799 --> 00:13:42.159
knowing that the governing body loves us this much.

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:47.149
I speak Korean.

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:49.629
I speak Japanese.

00:13:51.549 --> 00:13:53.870
We made a Japanese section and a Korean section

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:57.230
like what we would have at international conventions.

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:00.750
In order to watch the convention simultaneously,

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:03.149
we would count 1, 2, 3

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:05.470
and start playing our videos at the same time.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:08.750
This way we were able to watch and sing together.

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:11.230
It really felt like an international convention.

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:14.190
Something that I thought I would miss a lot

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:15.870
were the Kingdom Melodies.

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:18.750
So then I wondered, how is this going to work at home?

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:20.269
There won't be a crowd.

00:14:20.269 --> 00:14:21.870
Everyone's singing together.

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:23.389
How's it going to be?

00:14:23.389 --> 00:14:25.230
I thought I would really miss it.

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:28.909
But then my family and I agree to sing the Kingdom Melodies loudly.

00:14:28.909 --> 00:14:30.029
And it worked.

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:33.070
I have never seen my family sing so loudly.

00:14:42.909 --> 00:14:44.350
We have three children.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:48.110
And all five of us here at home, we all got COVID-19.

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:51.149
And all during the time that the convention was being shown,

00:14:51.149 --> 00:14:53.309
we were all exhibiting symptoms.

00:14:53.309 --> 00:14:55.149
It was a really hard time.

00:14:55.149 --> 00:14:58.669
Our family was so encouraged by the convention program this year.

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:02.429
My wife, Marisa, even said that to her,

00:15:02.429 --> 00:15:07.149
it was as if the talks the brothers gave were like hearing advice from a close friend

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:09.230
who was sitting right next to you,

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:11.549
like they were right in the same room with us.

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:17.070
The convention is very positive.

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:20.460
It's contagious.

00:15:21.259 --> 00:15:22.860
It has really touched our hearts.

00:15:24.139 --> 00:15:27.019
I truly feel the convention has touched my heart deeply.

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:30.860
Both my mom and my dad, who are right now struggling

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:36.539
with very serious illnesses, were able to join myself,

00:15:36.539 --> 00:15:38.620
my brother and my sister-in-law.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:42.139
And we were together as a family in our living room.

00:15:43.259 --> 00:15:47.259
We got to sing together and watch the assembly together,

00:15:47.259 --> 00:15:49.820
which otherwise just would not have been possible.

00:15:50.379 --> 00:15:57.019
Despite the struggles, despite the limitations that we may be in facing,

00:15:58.299 --> 00:16:01.500
none of that has stopped Jehovah from reaching out

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:05.659
and even being in our own living rooms during this convention.

00:16:08.019 --> 00:16:12.899
Jehovah transforms something that Satan is using right now to take away our joy

00:16:13.779 --> 00:16:16.740
to something that gives us joy. Think about it.

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:22.820
We're watching the same spiritual program at the same time with the same speakers,

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:24.740
brothers from the governing body.

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:27.620
We never imagine that we would have this opportunity.

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:32.110
Okay, are we all set?

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:41.860
Ready whenever you are if you want to go ahead?

00:16:42.259 --> 00:16:49.659
We are delighted that you could join us for this opening session

00:16:49.659 --> 00:16:53.019
of the Always Rejoice Convention of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:17:03.539
And when everything around you is chaotic, the one thing you have is your relationship with Jehovah.

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:10.349
I will walk in your truth,

00:17:11.549 --> 00:17:14.349
unifying my heart to fear your name.

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:46.099
But we discover something we have lost.

00:17:47.059 --> 00:18:02.109
Joy, no matter what terror, no matter what trial may come upon us now or in the future,

00:18:02.829 --> 00:18:08.829
we will be able to continue to rejoice in Jehovah's Acts of salvation.

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:20.140
While 2020 seemed to be anything but a time for rejoicing,

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:25.180
this year's convention proved that no matter what the circumstance we are in,

00:18:25.819 --> 00:18:30.539
Jehovah will continue to feed us and we will continue to worship him.

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:38.019
Thanks to Jehovah, we experienced the truthfulness of Philippians 4-4.

00:18:39.779 --> 00:18:46.420
But no matter the trial or difficulty, we will always rejoice in the Lord.
