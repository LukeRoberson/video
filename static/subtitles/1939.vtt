00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:17.739
Why does God allow suffering?

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:21.739
Jehovah God didn't intend for humans to suffer.

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:24.739
On the contrary,

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:28.739
He gave the first human couple a wonderful storm.

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:34.899
But Satan, a rebel angel,

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:36.899
called God a liar

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.899
and influenced the first humans to reject God's authority.

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:45.149
When Adam and Eve disobeyed God,

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.149
they chose to follow Satan.

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.149
They rebelled against Jehovah

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:56.420
and decided for themselves what was right and wrong.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.420
Was Satan correct?

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.420
Court humans ruled themselves successfully without help from God?

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.420
Time would be needed to settle the crucial issues raised by the rebels.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.420
To illustrate,

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.420
a rebellious student claims

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.420
that the teacher's method of instruction is wrong.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.420
He insists that he knows a much better way.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.420
Some students think that he is right

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.420
and they also become rebellious.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.930
What should the teacher do?

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.400
He has the authority to reprimand the rebellious students.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.400
But what effect would that choice have on the other students?

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.400
They may lose respect for the teacher,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.400
thinking that he is afraid of being proved wrong.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.400
But suppose the teacher allows the student to show the class his method.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.400
That it would be proved to all present

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:07.230
who is qualified to teach.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.229
Jehovah has done something similar to what the teacher does.

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:14.229
When Satan challenged Jehovah,

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:17.229
millions of angels were watching.

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:19.229
How Jehovah handled the rebellion

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:22.229
would greatly affect all those angels

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:26.229
and eventually all intelligent creation.

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:32.229
Knowing this, Jehovah allows Satan to rule this world for a time.

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:37.229
Satan's rule has caused untold pain and suffering.

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:41.229
However, once Jehovah's right and ability to rule

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:44.229
is established beyond any doubt,

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:50.229
Jehovah will undo all the damage caused by Satan's rebellion.

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:55.229
At that time, only people who choose to follow God's standards

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:59.219
will inhabit the earth.

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:04.219
Until then, how can you cope with suffering?

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:07.219
Where can you find comfort?

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:15.330
