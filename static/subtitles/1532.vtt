00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.089
Encouragement.

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:11.970
It comes in many forms, and it can affect our lives in ways we never imagined.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.969
The couple being interviewed were truly happy.

00:00:16.969 --> 00:00:24.929
They were enjoying so many blessings in Jehovah's service.

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:26.969
Their secret?

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:32.060
They simplified their life.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:44.070
With that assembly, we really thought about how we could do more to serve Jehovah.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:54.270
Working to maintain a pattern of life is exhausting.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.780
Even our vacations were tiring.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:12.060
We were both working to maintain our lifestyle, but our lifestyle was controlling us.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:27.670
We were spending money without even a thought.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:40.599
It seemed we were never satisfied with what we had.

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:45.760
In one of Jesus' illustrations, a rich man built bigger storehouses so he could store

00:01:45.760 --> 00:02:00.000
all his things.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.239
But then God said to the rich man,

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:08.199
Unreasonable one, this night they are demanding your life from you.

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:24.389
Who then is to have the things you stored up?

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:29.729
His things could not save his life.

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:34.090
We reflected on Ecclesiastes 222, which reads,

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.129
What does a man really gain from all his hard work and ambition that drives him to work

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.439
hard under the sun?

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:46.240
We meditated on what matters most.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:53.379
And we were determined to simplify our life.

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.620
We had stored up many things.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:10.479
And it wasn't easy letting go.

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:32.599
But the more we let go, the more we felt free.

00:03:32.599 --> 00:04:00.900
We analyzed our expenses, and we made adjustments.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:08.780
We prayed to Jehovah before making any decisions.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:05:02.019
With time and effort, we came to have more joy and freedoms we didn't think possible.

00:05:02.019 --> 00:05:06.699
Simplifying your life can take time, and it is not easy.

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:12.819
But the reward Jehovah gives can far outweigh any sacrifice we make.

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:17.339
With nothing to hold us back, we were now in a position to accept any assignment Jehovah

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:22.750
gave us.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:29.550
Now we could share our joy with others.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.470
We are truly happy.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.680
Our secret?

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.120
We live a simple life.
