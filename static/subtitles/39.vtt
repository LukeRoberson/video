WEBVTT

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:08.400
Welcome to the program. Our theme this month is organized to do God's will.

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:14.480
Among other things we will look at how our young brothers can be encouraged to reach out

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:21.039
so as to take the lead in the congregation. You will also enjoy this report on the blessings

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:27.359
around the world from using carts in our ministry and we'll find out how the organization

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:36.000
makes sure our meeting places are properly utilized. This is the July program of JW Broadcasting.

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.060
There are people who believe there is no need for a religious organization.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.659
They feel they have their own personal relationship with God and that is good enough.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:11.060
They see no need to be associated with a specific organization. However,

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.939
what does God's own inspired word suggest that he would use an organization or channel

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:24.659
through which spiritual food would be dispensed from his word, the Bible. For example,

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:31.060
1 Peter chapter 2 verse 17 says to have love for the whole association of brothers.

00:01:32.019 --> 00:01:39.060
One dictionary definition for association is an organization of persons having a common interest.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.019
We have a very interesting insightful look at the organization in the first century.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:53.219
If we glance down through chapter 15 of the Book of Acts, we can gain some insight.

00:01:54.019 --> 00:01:59.379
Verse 1 indicates there was an issue that caused a disagreement between some of the members of

00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:07.859
the congregation. Then verse 2 says, but after quite a bit of dissension and disputing by Paul and

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:13.379
Barnabas with them, it was arranged for Paul, Barnabas, and some of the others to go up to the

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:21.139
apostles and elders in Jerusalem regarding this issue. Sounds like an organization to me.

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:29.060
And after considerable discussion and with the help of God's Holy Spirit, what transpired?

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:38.099
Verse 22 and 23 say, then the apostles and the elders together with the whole congregation

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.020
decided to send chosen men from among them to Antioch, along with Paul and Barnabas. They sent

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.139
Judas, who was called Barcebus and Silas, who were leading men among the brothers.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:57.460
They wrote this and sent it through them. Then in verses 23 through 29 is the letter of direction

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:04.340
that was delivered to Antioch and other congregations as well. In fact, in verse 41, it says Paul and

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:12.020
Silas went through Syria and Selissia strengthening the congregations. Chapter 16 verse 5 says,

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:18.020
then indeed the congregations continued to be made firm in the faith and to increase the

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:24.500
number day by day. So it was not a matter of isolated Christians sitting at home,

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:32.819
claiming to have a personal relationship with God. No. The work was organized and congregations kept

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:39.780
being added day by day. That is very similar to what we see in Jehovah's organization today.

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:46.340
In fact, the organization of Jehovah's Witnesses has patterned after the first century Christian

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:53.379
congregation as said forth in the scriptures. I would like to remind all of Jehovah's Witnesses

00:03:53.379 --> 00:04:00.819
where they're already baptized or working toward baptism of this book, organized to do Jehovah's

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:07.379
will. It provides an overall view of how the Christian congregation is organized for getting

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:14.740
God's work done. The book also offers counsel and direction to help us maintain unity with our

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:21.300
brothers worldwide. New ones need to become familiar with the operation of Jehovah's organization

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:26.420
and learn how they can have a share in the modern day preaching work. In fact,

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.060
when a Bible student progresses and desires to join us in the ministry as an unbaptized publisher,

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:39.939
the elders direct him to make a study of this book, including the questions for those desiring to

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:46.980
get baptized in the appendix. Even for those of us who have been baptized many years,

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.899
it may be good to schedule the reading of one chapter of the book each week during our personal

00:04:52.899 --> 00:04:59.860
study or family worship. It contains general information concerning the duties of elders and

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:06.899
ministerial servants, judicial procedures, and various other features of congregation organization.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:14.660
I would like to take a few minutes and review some of the information in chapter one of the publication.

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:20.500
Though there are thousands of national and international organizations around the world,

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:28.660
they are organized according to human viewpoints and philosophies. But our organization is different.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:40.100
It is theocratic. That means it is ruled by Jehovah as head overall. Isaiah chapter 33 verse 22 says

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:48.740
he is our judge, logiver, and king. Many larger organizations appoint a chief executive officer

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:56.019
or CEO. He is the executive with the chief decision-making authority in a business or corporation.

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:04.019
In a similar way, Jehovah has appointed his son Jesus to be the one with chief decision-making

00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:13.620
authority over the congregation of God. Ephesians chapter 1 verse 22 is speaking of Jehovah's

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:22.259
actions and connection with Jesus. It says he also subjected all things under his feet and made him

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:30.579
head over all things with regard to the congregation. We see the structure of the organization taking

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:38.100
shape. Jehovah is the universal sovereign, the king, directing the millions of angels making up his

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:44.740
heavenly organization. But when it comes to directing the visible earthly part of God's organization,

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:50.819
he has delegated that responsibility to Jesus, the head of the congregation of God.

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:57.540
Chapter 2 of the organized book explains the scriptural position of Jesus.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:06.180
And how does Jesus direct the organization here on earth? Matthew 24, 45 says that Jesus has

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:12.259
appointed a faithful and discrete slave to serve spiritual food at the proper time.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:19.379
Today, seven anointed men make up the faithful slave, and collectively, they are known as the

00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:25.939
governing body. And Jesus uses the Holy Spirit to direct these men in harmony with the scriptures.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:32.420
The scriptural basis for this layer of organization is set forth in chapter 3 of the book.

00:07:33.939 --> 00:07:38.019
Chapter 4 is titled How the congregation is organized and governed.

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:45.620
The organizational structure incorporates branch committees, circuit overseers, elders,

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:52.660
and ministerial servants. The subject index in the back of the book can be useful to quickly gain

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:56.899
access to information on various aspects of the organization.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:03.060
Suppose you're a young person, maybe even a relatively young married couple.

00:08:03.939 --> 00:08:08.420
The circuit overseer is visiting, and he asks you what spiritual goals you have.

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:15.379
How would you answer? Would your mind start racing trying to think of various avenues of service

00:08:15.379 --> 00:08:24.740
available? How about now, before you are asked such a question, look in the subject index

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:31.220
under goals. There are 11 references to paragraphs in the book on that subject.

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:37.620
After reading about all of the possibilities and different categories you'd be in a better

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:44.179
position to plan your life for a great future in the earthly part of Jehovah's organization.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:53.039
At this time, I would like to draw your attention to a very important factor in a new ones making

00:08:53.039 --> 00:09:00.960
progress and attaining spiritual stability. On page 213 of the organized book,

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:09.039
it discusses a person interested in being baptized. After the elders go over the questions in part

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:16.000
3 of the book, it says this, if he has not completed his study of the Bible teach in God's love books,

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:25.200
the elders should make arrangements for someone to help him do so. The two books complement each

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:33.279
other so well. When someone becomes a dedicated and baptized servant of Jehovah, we want him to stay

00:09:33.279 --> 00:09:40.799
closely attached to the organization. Yet every year, there are a number who stop attending meetings

00:09:40.879 --> 00:09:47.759
and become inactive. At times, it has been found that they did not finish studying the two books.

00:09:48.639 --> 00:09:54.000
You see, the Bible Teachbook helps new ones to have an accurate knowledge of the Bible,

00:09:54.639 --> 00:10:00.639
and they often learn to love Jehovah. The keep yourselves in God's love book helps us to learn

00:10:00.639 --> 00:10:08.159
to apply the Bible and live in harmony with Jehovah's standards. Notice what Jesus told his faithful

00:10:08.159 --> 00:10:19.360
apostles at John chapter 15 and verse 10. If you observe my commandments, you will remain in my

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:27.279
love just as I have observed the commandments of the Father and remain in His love. Did you notice

00:10:27.279 --> 00:10:34.240
that Jesus remained in God's love by observing His Father's commandments? The same is true of us

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:40.399
today. To remain in God's love, we need to apply the truth in our everyday life.

00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:48.879
And what is the result if we keep ourselves in God's love? It is so clearly stated in Jude

00:10:49.679 --> 00:10:58.399
verse 21, in order to keep yourselves in God's love while you await the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ

00:10:58.399 --> 00:11:06.399
with ever-lasting life in view. Staying in God's love results in ever-lasting life.

00:11:07.519 --> 00:11:12.879
It is so important to make sure our Bible students complete a study of both books,

00:11:13.519 --> 00:11:20.080
and that applies to our children too. Sometimes as parents, we can assume that our children are

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:25.519
developing a trusting relationship with Jehovah because they've been going to meetings since they

00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:33.840
were very small. A relationship with Jehovah does not happen by means of osmosis. A child does not

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:40.480
simply absorb and assimilate truth and a love for God just by being in the presence of others

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:48.159
who have a close relationship with Jehovah. We very much appreciate all the videos we have in

00:11:48.159 --> 00:11:56.720
including become Jehovah's Friend and JW Broadcasting. But new ones and young ones need to be able

00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:04.080
to go through the process of deep study to get to the Bible's truth and it etched into their minds

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:12.000
and lodged deep into their hearts. Therefore, if you parents realize that you have not studied both

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.320
books with your young ones, it would be good to see that a schedule is established to do so.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:25.759
The governing body gives all credit for the success of this organization to Jehovah and the

00:12:25.759 --> 00:12:32.240
appointed head of the congregation Jesus Christ. We are just imperfect men trying to follow the

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:41.519
lead of Christ in the Holy Spirit. At 1 Corinthians chapter 1 verse 26, Paul says,

00:12:42.159 --> 00:12:47.279
for you see his calling of your brothers that there are not many wise in a fleshly way.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:55.600
Verse 27 says, but God chose the foolish things of the world to put the wise men to shame. Then

00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:04.799
verse 30 says that Christ Jesus has become to us wisdom from God. That is where the direction and

00:13:04.799 --> 00:13:13.039
wisdom of the organization comes from, not from mere man. The words of Jehovah to the Prophet

00:13:13.039 --> 00:13:20.320
Zechariah fit today when we see the amazing advances in the organization. Zechariah 46 says,

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:28.000
not by a military force nor by power, but by my spirit says Jehovah of armies.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:34.960
While there are some well-educated and prominent men who have accepted the truth and are now our

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:41.759
fellow brothers, the majority in the organization come from a more humble background. For example,

00:13:42.399 --> 00:13:47.360
among the first of Jehovah's modern-day servants who introduced the kingdom message to people in

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:54.960
Denmark was a shoemaker. In Switzerland and France, it was a gardener. In many parts of Africa,

00:13:54.960 --> 00:14:02.720
the message was carried by itinerant workers. In Brazil, sailors had a share. Quite a few of the

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:10.960
Polish witnesses in northern France were coal miners. Jehovah and Jesus used all of us to get a

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:17.200
remarkable work accomplished. We are proud to be a part of this spirit-directed organization.

00:14:17.919 --> 00:14:24.960
As one older circuit overseer was heard to say, this is the best imperfect organization on earth.

00:14:26.399 --> 00:14:32.639
There are no perfect organizations on earth. However, this is the best of them all.

00:14:33.679 --> 00:14:40.320
And we appreciate the contribution all of you make to the success of the preaching work worldwide.

00:14:42.539 --> 00:14:48.940
With that contribution in mind, consider for a moment the huge low-delders caring and caring for

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:55.659
our congregations. Some of them are now advanced in age. So how can young brothers be trained to

00:14:55.659 --> 00:15:02.620
qualify for increased responsibilities? In this dramatization, a congregation faces a change

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:18.830
on its elder body that brought that question to the fore. We're very happy for Daniel.

00:15:19.629 --> 00:15:30.799
He's going to be a blessing in his new assignment, but we are going to miss him.

00:15:31.919 --> 00:15:37.360
And everything he was doing for the congregation, this will change things for us.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:16:23.730
We really want to be there for our brothers and sisters. And it's true, having plenty to do in

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:38.019
the Lord's work is good. But where will we get more help? We do have good ministerial servants

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:53.379
like Richie. But after Daniel left, our older body is one fewer now. That prompted a good question.

00:16:54.419 --> 00:17:07.819
Are we doing all we can to train our brothers? Richie, do you have some time for me?

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:11.339
I have some calls you can help me with. Sure, I'd like that.

00:17:11.339 --> 00:17:22.059
Realized it had been a while since we talked about him qualifying to do more.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:27.259
He explained he wanted to help but didn't want to appear presumptuous.

00:17:27.259 --> 00:17:31.900
He'd been praying about it and he wanted to know what else he could do to keep reaching out.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:41.019
Talking to Richie made me think of Jesus' example. His disciples offered themselves willingly

00:17:41.019 --> 00:17:45.019
and he trained them. They were eager but needed his direction.

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:53.650
Jesus' training gave them confidence to do the assignments he gave them. They were happy.

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:58.529
Not just to follow Jesus but to work alongside him.

00:18:00.049 --> 00:18:05.410
And Jesus was happy to share his work. Up to his final evening with them,

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:13.089
he prepared them for the work ahead. Most truly I say to you, whoever exercises faith in me

00:18:13.089 --> 00:18:19.009
will also do the works that I do and he will do works greater than these because I am going my way

00:18:19.009 --> 00:18:26.799
to the Father. I now remember how much training I had received from the brothers.

00:18:36.509 --> 00:18:39.789
It was easy to forget that I didn't always get things right at first.

00:18:49.099 --> 00:18:56.380
Soon Richie was taken on more responsibility and he told me something that I too once felt.

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:06.130
He just didn't realize how much work went into caring for Jehovah's sheep but once he knew

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:24.700
he was glad he offered himself willingly. We commend all our hardworking elders for their fine work

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:30.220
and also those of you who support them whether you are a ministerial servant or

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:36.059
perhaps the wife of an elder. Without your help and support, it would be very difficult for our

00:19:36.059 --> 00:19:42.700
dear elders to carry out their weighty responsibilities. While there is a lot of work to be done on

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:49.660
a local level, there is an unprecedented global effort to provide spiritual food to all of God's

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:55.740
people. Under the direction of the teaching committee of the governing body, the audio video services

00:19:55.740 --> 00:20:01.740
department or AVS takes the lead in producing audio and video publications.

00:20:02.539 --> 00:20:09.740
It's been said that if a picture is worth a thousand words, then a video is worth a million.

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:15.900
Videos stir our emotions, don't they? And they can be very powerful teaching tools.

00:20:16.619 --> 00:20:23.339
Brother Russell recognized this fact. Back in 1914, the small group of Bible students presented

00:20:23.339 --> 00:20:31.579
the photodrama of creation to over nine million people worldwide. And the response was overwhelming.

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:39.420
It was clear that Jehovah blessed their efforts at spreading the Bible's message in a visual way.

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:46.059
Well, over a hundred years later, the faithful discrete slave is producing videos.

00:20:46.859 --> 00:20:55.339
And for many years, basically, one large public release video was being released or produced

00:20:55.339 --> 00:21:02.859
each year. For example, back in 2011, the video Faith and Action Part Two was released.

00:21:03.579 --> 00:21:10.539
And it required a tremendous effort to produce the video master, the audio tracks, the graphics,

00:21:10.539 --> 00:21:20.539
the music, the on-screen text for one video. However, just five years later, the work has grown from

00:21:20.539 --> 00:21:30.220
producing an average of one video per year to one video per day. This is because videos are now

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:37.740
a regular part of our website. The broadcasts are ministry, the conventions, meetings, and other

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:47.180
special events. In 2016, more than 350 videos were produced. Under the direction of the teaching

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:54.380
committee, audio video services has been entrusted with this work. But with this rapid increase

00:21:54.380 --> 00:22:01.019
in the amount of videos produced, how is all this accomplished? Perhaps you've heard the expression,

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:09.259
it takes a village. In this case, it takes an entire globe. Now, please enjoy the following video

00:22:09.259 --> 00:22:13.900
for a close-up look at how audio and video work is accomplished worldwide.

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:27.440
Ready? Action! To assist with the growing workload in audio video services,

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:34.240
the governing body has approved 11 full-time regional video teams in branches around the world.

00:22:35.039 --> 00:22:41.279
But it doesn't stop there. Bethelites, commuters, and remote workers in many other branches also

00:22:41.279 --> 00:22:48.559
provide valuable assistance. How do we work with all these teams? After receiving direction from

00:22:48.559 --> 00:22:55.119
the governing body committees for upcoming videos, AVS then assigns each video to a capable team.

00:22:58.059 --> 00:23:03.259
Once the team accepts the assignment, we provide them with a necessary direction,

00:23:03.259 --> 00:23:08.859
as well as answer any questions they may have. Then, the team goes to work.

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:31.650
Because of being a small group, each team member may have to wear multiple hats to get the job done.

00:23:32.609 --> 00:23:39.410
From start to finish, they all work very hard to deliver a completed edited video to us by the

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:47.730
designated time. Later, you may see these videos on JW Broadcasts, JW.org or other places.

00:23:54.579 --> 00:23:57.460
Would you like to meet some of our RVT family?

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:09.700
It's a privilege. We meet friends who have suffered some hardships and trials.

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:16.019
But because of their trust in Jehovah, they were able to overcome them, and we see the

00:24:16.019 --> 00:24:23.940
results of their loyalty. I think it strengthens our determination to also stay loyal.

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:32.500
We are a joyful team, with a lot of humor, and we work together very harmoniously.

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:37.940
You could say that we are like a little family. We look forward to the next day when we go to work

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:43.779
again. It's unbelievable how many dear brothers and sisters we've gotten to know through these

00:24:43.779 --> 00:24:49.460
projects. Close ties can develop, and it is not uncommon that tears flow when the project is

00:24:49.859 --> 00:24:51.380
over, and it is time to say goodbye.

00:24:55.619 --> 00:25:01.539
Sometimes we would film on private or state property, and I would have to approach the manager and

00:25:01.539 --> 00:25:07.700
let them know what we were planning to shoot at the location. This wasn't easy for me because

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:13.539
I'm not very good with words. And many people in Korea tend to have a biased view of

00:25:13.539 --> 00:25:22.819
Jehovah's Witnesses, so this made it even harder for me. So I pray to Jehovah, asking for his

00:25:22.819 --> 00:25:29.539
guidance and wisdom. I was surprised to find that many were more than willing to help us.

00:25:32.619 --> 00:25:39.740
These experiences helped me to realize that Jehovah always answers our prayers for strength and

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:49.230
courage. You have to balance your time around work, around being ahead of family,

00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:56.109
being an elder or other responsibilities that you have with congregation. That's when you really

00:25:56.109 --> 00:26:04.509
see Jehovah's hand when you see the mountain of challenge, but you overcome it, and you know it

00:26:04.509 --> 00:26:12.109
wasn't you. It was impossible for you to do it yourself. When I put even half the amount of energy

00:26:12.109 --> 00:26:18.029
and effort that I do into working for Jehovah into something secular, I'm wiped out. I need a

00:26:18.029 --> 00:26:26.910
vacation. But the more I put into working for Jehovah, the more I want to work. To know that you

00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:32.910
are offering your skills to Jehovah, that is a blessing, but really the blessing is seeing your

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:39.950
relationship with Jehovah thrive and be stronger. And you can see that he does keep his promises

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:48.539
and that he supports you more than you're supporting him. Many of us aren't able to be full-time

00:26:48.539 --> 00:26:54.940
Bethelites, but commuting really helps us get that small snippet of what it's like to be a Bethelite

00:26:54.940 --> 00:27:01.339
and realize what a privilege it is. And if you've got a specific talent, use it. One day,

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:05.980
in paradise, someone's going to come to you and say, how did you use your talent? Maybe you're

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:11.819
a brilliant artist and you're going to proudly turn around and say, you know what, I used for Jehovah.

00:27:12.539 --> 00:27:19.019
Even if you're young, you can learn skills and you can really assist Jehovah's organization

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:27.660
now and in the future. And there is no better boss to work for than Jehovah. My advice to young

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:36.380
ones. Go for it. And during this past year, we were excited to add a new team to our AVS family,

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:44.990
located in Miroloma, California. All in this group have made themselves available for video needs

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:51.329
out there. You're able to take a person, you're able to take an individual that has dedicated their

00:27:51.329 --> 00:27:55.250
life to Jehovah. And maybe they didn't know at the time that they were going to inspire somebody

00:27:55.250 --> 00:28:01.569
else and have somebody somewhere across the planet say, wow, that's exactly my life, too. I'm so

00:28:01.569 --> 00:28:07.730
glad that this person was selected to be on here because that's my life. And that has triggered

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:14.289
me to want to do more for Jehovah. You know, Jehovah's Holy Spirit, he's putting together a team.

00:28:14.289 --> 00:28:18.849
He's the great producer. And what he really wants is he wants people that have the talent,

00:28:18.849 --> 00:28:22.369
but he wants people that have the Holy Spirit more and are willing to work for it.

00:28:23.089 --> 00:28:28.210
But he gives you the ability like a holy ab and bezel to be able to put your talents that you've

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:35.970
learned to work for him. As you can see, we're part of a beautiful hard working global team.

00:28:37.009 --> 00:28:44.609
With so many hands helping the load in so many time zones, we're literally working on videos 24-7.

00:28:47.519 --> 00:28:53.119
It's a great privilege to work alongside our extended family. We learn from each other.

00:28:53.119 --> 00:28:59.680
They're willing spirit, humble attitude, and contagious joy inspire all of us here in AVS.

00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:10.130
Additionally, we receive incredible support right at home to virtually every department at

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:16.690
Bethel supports the audio video work in some way. And we are very, very thankful.

00:29:18.529 --> 00:29:24.049
With everyone's help, the Bible's message is being spread visually throughout the earth

00:29:24.049 --> 00:29:35.200
at unprecedented levels. But how is any of this possible? Brother Russell said it best,

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:43.329
this is not man's work, it's gods. Jehovah is certainly at the helm.

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:50.450
As he foretold that hey guy chapter 2 and verse 7, I will shake all the nations and the

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:56.369
precious things of all the nations will come in and I will fill this house with glory.

00:29:56.849 --> 00:30:06.210
There is certainly a great shaking taking place worldwide. And many of these precious ones are offering

00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:13.730
themselves willingly to help audio video services accomplish this great work. Thanks to Jehovah God,

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:23.380
our grand and visual instructor. Our videos are a fantastic provision from Jehovah.

00:30:24.099 --> 00:30:29.859
And what a teaching tool they have become. We get many letters of appreciation about the use of

00:30:29.859 --> 00:30:37.059
our videos in our midweek meetings. And I agree, the videos make the meetings so much more dynamic.

00:30:37.779 --> 00:30:44.660
For example, the week of July 17, we will be considering the part, do you forgive yourself?

00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:49.619
Which includes a video that we first saw at the 2016 regional convention.

00:30:49.779 --> 00:30:56.579
Make it a habit to prepare for these video considerations just as thoroughly as you would any

00:30:56.579 --> 00:31:02.019
other part. Your well prepared comments will benefit the whole congregation.

00:31:03.059 --> 00:31:08.259
And when we arrive at the kingdom hall for a meeting, don't you agree that we all feel refreshed

00:31:08.259 --> 00:31:14.180
the moment we see the smiling faces of our brothers and sisters? That's how I feel.

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:19.059
Sometimes we can even take our beautiful meeting location for granted.

00:31:20.019 --> 00:31:25.619
But did you know that a lot of work goes into making sure that our kingdom halls are well utilized?

00:31:26.819 --> 00:31:33.619
The Worldwide Design Construction Department, or WDC, is tasked with analyzing our worldwide needs

00:31:33.619 --> 00:31:40.500
and providing direction to local design construction departments on how best to use our dedicated funds.

00:31:45.309 --> 00:31:50.670
As we approach the end of the present system of things, Jehovah continues to speed up the work.

00:31:51.309 --> 00:31:56.750
We now have more than 62,000 kingdom halls worldwide, and the demand is still growing.

00:31:57.470 --> 00:32:02.910
Jehovah's blessing on the kingdom work is undeniable, as this could not have been accomplished otherwise.

00:32:04.109 --> 00:32:08.589
Many have been working for years in support of kingdom hall and assembly hall construction

00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:15.230
projects, most recently as part of the local design construction or LDC program.

00:32:16.029 --> 00:32:21.869
This program was implemented during the 2014 service year and unifies the approach for

00:32:21.869 --> 00:32:27.470
construction of kingdom halls worldwide. What has been accomplished since the program started?

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:33.710
At the end of the 2000 service year, half of the publisher's worldwide met in suitable meeting

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:40.430
places. However, the other half, approximately 3 million publishers, met in places that were

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:47.869
overcrowded or otherwise unsuitable as kingdom halls. At that time, 27,000 kingdom halls were needed.

00:32:49.309 --> 00:32:54.750
By 2014, the number of publishers meeting in unsuitable facilities had been reduced,

00:32:55.789 --> 00:33:01.630
but due to growth in the organization, this still meant that 1.6 million publishers

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:09.710
did not have a suitable meeting place. Since 2014, that figure has been reduced by 25%.

00:33:10.509 --> 00:33:15.630
What accounts for this significant reduction in the backlog, allowing us to catch up faster than

00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:22.269
in the past? Part of the answer lies in making efficient use of the facilities we already have.

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:28.109
When providing food for thousands, Jesus made it clear that nothing should be wasted.

00:33:29.069 --> 00:33:35.549
The LDC program applies that principle to the seats in our kingdom halls. As noted earlier,

00:33:35.549 --> 00:33:42.029
we have 62,000 kingdom halls worldwide. On average, only 60% of the seats are filled for

00:33:42.029 --> 00:33:49.549
congregation meetings. That means that approximately 3 to 4 million seats are empty during congregation

00:33:49.549 --> 00:33:55.710
meetings each week. There are a number of options to help make better use of these seats,

00:33:55.710 --> 00:34:01.230
which will make the use of each kingdom hall more efficient. Consider, for example, a kingdom hall

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:07.789
in an urban area. It has 200 seats and is used by four congregations sharing the facility.

00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:14.349
That means the kingdom hall will be in use for four weeknight meetings and four weekend meetings.

00:34:15.309 --> 00:34:20.510
It would definitely appear to be fully utilized and suggest the need for new construction

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:26.429
for further growth. However, how many seats were in the kingdom hall? 200.

00:34:27.469 --> 00:34:34.190
Multiplyed by meetings for the four congregations, this facility has a total seating capacity of 800

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:40.590
people. Global records indicate that congregations using this size kingdom hall have an average

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:48.269
attendance of 120 at their meetings. This could mean that only 480 seats are used by the four

00:34:48.269 --> 00:34:55.070
congregations in this kingdom hall and 320 seats remain empty, not very efficient.

00:34:56.030 --> 00:35:00.269
If the four congregations were redistributed into three congregations,

00:35:00.909 --> 00:35:06.429
average meeting attendance for each congregation would increase to about 160 per meeting,

00:35:06.429 --> 00:35:11.869
while still fitting comfortably in that kingdom hall. And this would now allow for an open slot

00:35:11.949 --> 00:35:17.789
in the schedule, which could be used to meet needs in the area without requiring new construction.

00:35:18.909 --> 00:35:24.829
In the first three years of the LDC program, fully utilizing our existing facilities

00:35:24.829 --> 00:35:30.909
played a part in reducing the backlog of kingdom hall projects from 14,000 to approximately

00:35:30.909 --> 00:35:37.710
10,000. This saved millions of dollars. Of course, this does not meet every need,

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:42.030
and there's still a significant need to construct new kingdom halls to provide suitable

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:48.190
places of worship. How does the branch office make these decisions and how our priority set?

00:35:49.469 --> 00:35:54.349
All options are examined as the branch committees work with their local design construction

00:35:54.349 --> 00:36:00.989
and service departments. Transportation needs such as distance, opportunities for carpooling,

00:36:00.989 --> 00:36:04.750
and availability of public transportation are taken into account.

00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:12.030
In many cases, congregations can be sized to make better use of available seats in kingdom halls

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:18.349
that have already been built. However, when they are needed, new kingdom halls can be constructed

00:36:18.349 --> 00:36:25.469
using simple standard designs that make wise use of denated funds. Of course, all of this must

00:36:25.469 --> 00:36:31.469
be done with a big picture in mind. It is the spiritual needs of the congregations that are

00:36:31.469 --> 00:36:37.710
of the utmost priority. The structures themselves are not the focus of the centers of pure worship,

00:36:38.269 --> 00:36:45.309
but rather it is the people who use the facilities. On one occasion, as they passed the temple,

00:36:45.949 --> 00:36:50.429
Mark 131 quotes one of Jesus' disciples admiring the structure when he said,

00:36:51.389 --> 00:36:59.070
Teach us see what wonderful stones and buildings. However, Jesus reply simply indicated that the

00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:08.030
building itself would not last. It was people Jesus was concerned with. Likewise, the kingdom halls

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:14.750
that we built today were not last forever, but these centers of pure worship bring people together

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:20.590
so that we can serve Jehovah as a united group, and that will last forever.

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:26.269
Whether we assist in the construction of the many kingdom halls that are still needed,

00:37:26.269 --> 00:37:32.670
or help to renovate and maintain existing kingdom halls, it is our shared privilege to help

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:39.309
provide suitable meeting places for our brothers and sisters. In this way, we each support the

00:37:39.309 --> 00:37:45.630
faithful and discreet slave as they provide what is needed so that each congregation can praise

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:56.639
Jehovah in a suitable place of worship. Brother Thomas Calameras, who serves at the United States

00:37:56.639 --> 00:38:02.800
branch together with his wife, has spent close to four decades supporting various aspects

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:07.679
of the organization's construction projects. What does that experience taught him?

00:38:08.639 --> 00:38:11.199
That the work is not run by us.

00:38:16.289 --> 00:38:20.769
Throughout history, men have built many beautiful and impressive buildings.

00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:28.769
These structures have usually brought glory to men, not to God, but those men are long gone,

00:38:28.769 --> 00:38:36.369
and even many of the structures no longer exist. How true is the Scripture in Psalm 1271,

00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:43.409
unless Jehovah builds the house, it is in vain that its builders work hard on it.

00:38:44.929 --> 00:38:51.650
In our time too, Jehovah is using his people to build. We're working hard to build spirituality

00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:59.090
on interested ones, and also we build structures in order to help individuals to learn about Jehovah

00:38:59.090 --> 00:39:05.969
and serve him. In this type of construction, both spiritually and physical construction, I've been

00:39:05.969 --> 00:39:12.530
involved for most of my life. I was born in Greece, our family came into contact with the truth

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:20.690
in the early 60s. I was baptized when I was in high school. I left school to get some practical

00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:28.690
training and architecture, but I made pioneering my career. In 1973, I met my dear wife, Margaret,

00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:35.250
and together we enjoy many assignments, we pioneer, special pioneering. We went to Gilead.

00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:45.010
We were invited to Bethel in 1979 to work in the engineering department. We worked on designing new

00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:54.690
branches, assembly halls, kingdom halls, renovation of existing branches, and remote translation offices.

00:39:55.170 --> 00:40:02.769
Before we came to Bethel, we had seen how Jehovah provided for us individually, but now we had the

00:40:02.769 --> 00:40:08.449
opportunity to see how Jehovah provided for the needs of his organization globally.

00:40:10.369 --> 00:40:16.610
By the year 2000, we became apparent that the present facility of the Britain branch was not

00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:23.489
meeting their needs. So, a site was located 50 miles north of London to relocate the branch

00:40:23.489 --> 00:40:32.210
there. However, the governing body decided to cancel the project. So, in 2008, the governing body

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:41.010
wrote that now is a time, Jehovah's time, to find a property closer to London. So, a project

00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:46.210
was formed and a few years went by and a number of properties were searched and one was located

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:53.889
closer to London. If something we plan falls through, it could mean that Jehovah has something else

00:40:53.889 --> 00:41:01.329
or better in mind to meet the needs of his organization. Well, working in the Haiti branch,

00:41:01.329 --> 00:41:09.329
we learn a lesson not to compromise on safety. The Brooklyn Engineering Department did the drawings

00:41:09.329 --> 00:41:16.449
for the branch and a local contractor was hired to build the structural work. Now, the contractor,

00:41:16.449 --> 00:41:21.170
when he reviewed the drawings, told the branch committee that, really, this is over-design,

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:26.530
you're wasting a lot of money by putting all that still in the building. So, we wrote back and

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:32.690
said, no, the drawings are okay. The branch is designed according to the seismic zone that is in

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:41.650
and the contractor to go ahead with the plans as drawn. In 2010, when the earthquake came into Haiti,

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:49.329
hundreds of thousands of people died because of inferior materials and methods of construction.

00:41:51.389 --> 00:41:57.710
However, the branch did not suffer any damage and many people went there to find refuge.

00:41:58.429 --> 00:42:07.309
We are so glad that Jehovah did not allow us to be swayed in this case. Jehovah continues to

00:42:07.309 --> 00:42:13.550
direct a great physical building work and a spiritual work. Jehovah trains his people how to

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:19.789
work together for the work just ahead of us, the beautification of this earth to a paradise.

00:42:20.269 --> 00:42:27.949
It is so important that we trust in Jehovah and not to lean upon our own understanding.

00:42:27.949 --> 00:42:35.389
A life of building with Jehovah has shown me the wisdom of Psalm 1271. If we keep building our

00:42:35.389 --> 00:42:46.719
lives with Jehovah, our building work will never be in vain. The more responsibility a brother is

00:42:46.719 --> 00:42:53.199
given in the organization, the less he feels he is in control. Instead, he will clearly see how

00:42:53.199 --> 00:42:58.880
Jehovah takes the lead in the organization. Brother Kalimeras' experience confirms that.

00:42:59.679 --> 00:43:05.440
The account about how the branch in Haiti was protected from earthquake damage sent chills down my

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:14.639
spine. While some buildings looked like this, our branch looked like this. It wasn't the ingenuity of

00:43:14.639 --> 00:43:21.679
the brothers that protected the branch, but wisdom only Jehovah can provide. How can we apply that

00:43:21.679 --> 00:43:26.800
same wisdom in our lives? Let's consider three ways we can do so.

00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:38.590
Jehovah has warned us that we're living in critical times hard to deal with.

00:43:43.219 --> 00:43:49.139
And Jesus foretold that in the last days, there would be great earthquakes in one place after

00:43:49.139 --> 00:43:59.420
another and other fearful sites. Many of us either have or will be affected by some form of natural

00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:13.019
disaster. If this happens, how can we be prepared? First, we can prepare spiritually by maintaining

00:44:13.019 --> 00:44:21.019
a close relationship with Jehovah. He is the God of all comfort, and he can comfort us in times of

00:44:21.019 --> 00:44:29.980
tribulation. How does he do this? We do not expect divine intervention, but if we pray during times of

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:36.300
distress, his powerful Holy Spirit can bring Bible passages back to mind to comfort us.

00:44:39.119 --> 00:44:44.800
Second, we can take practical steps, perhaps preparing an emergency kit.

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:49.599
Our kit could contain the following items if possible.

00:44:51.920 --> 00:45:03.809
First aid supplies, bottled water, and non-perishable food. Also, we shouldn't forget to update

00:45:03.809 --> 00:45:11.809
the elders with our latest contact information. If we don't do so, valuable time could be lost

00:45:11.809 --> 00:45:22.750
in a disaster. Additionally, during a family worship evening, our family could review the types

00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:29.389
of disasters that might happen and what could be done in each situation, such as where we meet,

00:45:30.349 --> 00:45:40.110
how we contact the elders, and so forth. And third, we can help others when they're experiencing a

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:51.250
disaster knowing they do the same for us. How can we do this? By offering prayers in their behalf.

00:45:53.250 --> 00:46:00.050
By volunteering to assist with disaster relief efforts, and by contributing donations to the

00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:11.170
worldwide work. No, we can't avoid all natural disasters, but if we prepare spiritually,

00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:18.690
practically, and help others currently affected, we can take comfort in knowing that in Jehovah's

00:46:18.690 --> 00:46:26.050
Eyes, we are prepared. That was great practical advice for all of us to take to heart,

00:46:26.849 --> 00:46:32.050
but there are some things we can do to help our local congregation. Let's turn briefly to

00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:36.210
interview brother Bram Siegel, who's with the co-ordinators committee office.

00:46:37.489 --> 00:46:43.570
Bram, how can all of us cooperate with the congregation arrangement when a disaster hits?

00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:50.449
Immediately after a disaster occurs, each field service group overseer will contact everyone in

00:46:50.449 --> 00:46:56.210
his group to make sure that all are accounted for, and to make sure if anyone needs assistance.

00:46:56.210 --> 00:47:01.170
So each of us should make sure to give the elders our up-to-date contact information.

00:47:01.170 --> 00:47:03.250
That way they can reach us when something happens.

00:47:04.449 --> 00:47:11.489
That's a very important reminder, good point. But what if my area was not hit by the disaster,

00:47:11.489 --> 00:47:17.809
but an adjacent town or city was? Can I just travel there on my own to help or what should I do?

00:47:17.809 --> 00:47:24.210
We really appreciate the beautiful spirit the Brotherhood shows when it comes to providing disaster

00:47:24.210 --> 00:47:31.730
relief. Really, the best time to make yourself available to help is right now before a disaster occurs.

00:47:32.289 --> 00:47:37.409
Just ask your local elders for an application. Later, when there's a need to provide disaster

00:47:37.409 --> 00:47:41.409
relief, the branch office will know that you're willing and ready to assist.

00:47:41.409 --> 00:47:45.570
Thank you very much, Bram, for those important reminders.

00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:54.929
Thank you. When large disasters occur, our brothers and sisters may have to relocate,

00:47:54.929 --> 00:48:00.050
perhaps even to another country. As refugees, they face unique challenges.

00:48:01.090 --> 00:48:06.769
You'll notice that the Watchtower study for the week of July 3rd provides practical suggestions

00:48:06.769 --> 00:48:13.170
on how we can support such brothers and sisters. And I'm sure you agree that the guidance

00:48:13.170 --> 00:48:18.769
Jehovah's organization provides the love and care that we experience every day as a people

00:48:18.769 --> 00:48:25.010
for his name, the spiritual paradise that we dwell in. All of that makes us want to praise

00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:32.610
our Heavenly Father. This brings us to this month's music video, which is entitled, We Marvel

00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:33.570
at Your Work.

00:49:14.059 --> 00:52:52.530
That's beautiful and how can we show our appreciation for Jehovah's provisions

00:52:52.530 --> 00:52:58.130
in a practical way by taking seriously our God-given assignment to preach?

00:52:58.849 --> 00:53:02.449
And we have seen developments in our preaching methods in the past few years.

00:53:03.250 --> 00:53:09.329
For example, in 2001, with the governing body's approval, our brothers in France started using

00:53:09.329 --> 00:53:14.690
a variety of methods to carry out our public witnessing, including the use of carts.

00:53:15.570 --> 00:53:23.329
The trial resulted in many good experiences. As a result, in 2011, a pilot project with

00:53:23.329 --> 00:53:31.840
cart witnessing in New York City, USA, was approved. Since Manhattan and New York City had a ratio of

00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:39.199
one Jehovah's Witness to 657 inhabitants, this was a perfect choice. That was the beginning of a

00:53:39.199 --> 00:53:47.070
pilot program in Manhattan. The program lasted one year using many graduates from what was then the

00:53:47.070 --> 00:53:52.989
school for Christian couples. Although different tables were used at the time, it was evident that a

00:53:52.989 --> 00:53:59.070
mobile cart had many advantages. As a result, today, Jehovah's Witnesses are well-known for their

00:53:59.070 --> 00:54:05.710
public witnessing using carts designed to display their literature. By means of this method, good news

00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:10.909
from the Bible can be taken to many places and easily becomes available to countless people.

00:54:13.789 --> 00:54:18.989
These carts include different posters that, call attention to our well-known publications,

00:54:20.110 --> 00:54:26.269
invite people to accept free home Bible studies, and direct passers-by to our official website.

00:54:27.550 --> 00:54:31.389
Here are just a few examples of how this method has had many good results.

00:54:33.789 --> 00:54:39.710
My name is Mi Jong Yu. The first time I met Jehovah's Witnesses was more than 20 years ago.

00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:45.949
I started studying in the You Can Live Forever book, but about a month later, I had to stop studying.

00:54:46.909 --> 00:54:52.030
After that, I would accept the magazines, but I never ended up studying the Bible again.

00:54:52.829 --> 00:54:59.469
In June of 2014, though, I saw the public witnessing stand. I realized that it belonged to

00:54:59.469 --> 00:55:06.190
Jehovah's Witnesses. So many of the different publications they had caught my eye, so I asked if it

00:55:06.190 --> 00:55:12.590
would be okay if I took a copy of each one. We ended up exchanging numbers, and a few weeks later,

00:55:12.590 --> 00:55:20.110
the brother contacted me. I began studying the Bible again with a couple, and one month later,

00:55:20.110 --> 00:55:27.550
started attending meetings regularly. I was baptized in October of 2015, and started

00:55:27.550 --> 00:55:34.590
auxiliary pioneering right away for 10 months. Now I'm serving as a regular pioneer. Public witnessing

00:55:34.590 --> 00:55:40.670
helped me find a truth, and it's a way for me to meet people that are interested like I was.

00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:44.110
I have really come to cherish the public witnessing work.

00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:52.989
My name is Rakob Salome. I work as a driver and spend most of my life traveling all over Peru.

00:55:53.949 --> 00:55:57.230
Because of this, I had problems with the woman I was living with.

00:55:58.269 --> 00:56:01.309
I never spent time at home and practically lived in the truck.

00:56:06.099 --> 00:56:09.699
I would see Jehovah's Witnesses preaching on the streets near the buses,

00:56:10.739 --> 00:56:15.139
but since I was always driving, I couldn't park or even talk to them.

00:56:16.739 --> 00:56:19.940
But once I saw some witnesses preaching in a public square,

00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:24.260
so I went up to them to ask them what the Bible says about family matters.

00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:34.400
This marked a change in my life. My girlfriend and I began attending meetings,

00:56:36.929 --> 00:56:42.530
and then we got married and got baptized. Now we are Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:49.699
As Annie's and I were standing by our cart, we met Young Sodashan.

00:56:50.579 --> 00:56:55.619
Annie showed him our tract. Can the dead really live again? He was surprised and said,

00:56:55.619 --> 00:57:01.059
how is it possible? When she explained to him, Acts 24-15, he exclaimed,

00:57:01.699 --> 00:57:07.780
I am a Christian. I never knew this. I asked him, would you like to learn more about such wonderful

00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:14.179
things from the Bible? He asked, can you tell me right now? There and then I discussed the

00:57:14.179 --> 00:57:20.019
first chapter of the textbook. That's how it started. Sodashan bought his friend Saga.

00:57:20.739 --> 00:57:26.659
Saga in turn brought Shiva and Shrikant along. Three of them are attending our meetings regularly.

00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:31.619
Saga even turned down a job offer that conflicted with Bible principles.

00:57:32.739 --> 00:57:38.019
One tract resulted in many Bible studies. We can really see Jehovah's blessing

00:57:38.019 --> 00:57:56.829
on this form of public witnessing. Without a doubt,

00:57:56.829 --> 00:58:01.550
cart witnessing is being used to help preach the good news of God's kingdom in all the inhabited

00:58:01.550 --> 00:58:22.130
earth for a witness to all the nations. The examples we've seen in this program,

00:58:22.769 --> 00:58:29.170
truly highlight how Jehovah and Jesus used all of us to get an unprecedented work accomplished.

00:58:30.289 --> 00:58:34.210
We've seen how young brothers are trained to take the lead in the congregations,

00:58:34.929 --> 00:58:38.530
how videos are produced around the world for our spiritual benefit,

00:58:39.409 --> 00:58:42.530
the work that goes into better utilizing our kingdom halls,

00:58:43.250 --> 00:58:49.570
how wisdom from Jehovah benefits our construction work, and how appropriate it is to praise our

00:58:49.570 --> 00:58:55.650
heavenly Father for all His words. And last, we were encouraged to continue in our public

00:58:55.650 --> 00:59:03.650
witnessing efforts as we clearly see Jehovah's blessing. Yes, we are proud to be Jehovah's

00:59:03.650 --> 00:59:12.530
witnesses. This is the best organization on earth. To conclude, we'd like to share this postcard

00:59:12.530 --> 00:59:20.130
from Iceland. Almost 335,000 people live on this North Atlantic island nation of which

00:59:20.130 --> 00:59:28.130
about 380 are Jehovah's witnesses. Iceland is known for being the land of ice and fire as it has

00:59:28.130 --> 00:59:35.250
both a lot of volcanic activity but also Europe's largest glacier. In their free time,

00:59:35.250 --> 00:59:40.530
the witnesses in Iceland enjoy hiking in the beautiful nature riding on horseback on Icelandic

00:59:40.530 --> 00:59:49.010
horses. The preaching work in Iceland began in 1929 where the Lindel was the only publisher on the

00:59:49.010 --> 00:59:58.849
island for nearly 18 years. Today, the 380 publishers conduct approximately 270 Bible studies and almost

00:59:58.849 --> 01:00:06.449
700 people attended the memorial of Christ's death last year. In the winter, the sun is up only

01:00:06.449 --> 01:00:12.530
for a few hours. While the witnesses use the limited sunlight wisely going from door to door or

01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:20.130
business witnessing, they are not scared by the darkness. Some congregations use tiny lights on

01:00:20.130 --> 01:00:26.929
their public witnessing carts so that the pastors by will see the cards. Also, the weather in Iceland

01:00:26.929 --> 01:00:33.170
can change quickly to prevent literature from being damaged by rain or other weather elements.

01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:40.610
Some congregations use plastic covers on the literature. In 2011, a Polish group was established

01:00:40.610 --> 01:00:47.329
in the capital city of Reykjavik in 2016, a congregation with over 40 publishers was formed.

01:00:48.610 --> 01:00:55.329
Today, they conduct over 20 Bible studies. All the brothers and sisters in Iceland

01:00:55.329 --> 01:01:01.969
send their warm Christian love. We pray that Jehovah will continue to bless their efforts in praising

01:01:01.969 --> 01:01:09.570
his name. This is JW Broadcasting from the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses.
