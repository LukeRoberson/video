00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.300
Hey, Camille!

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.300
Hey!

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.300
Come on in.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.300
They just finished.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.539
Oh, thank you.

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:20.539
Hi, Mom.

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:21.539
Hey, sweetheart.

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.539
How was your study?

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:24.539
It was great.

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.539
So, what did you learn today?

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.539
I learned how Jehovah is our father.

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.539
What does that mean?

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:37.539
Well, Jesus taught us that we should call Jehovah our father.

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:40.539
But I didn't know why.

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:41.539
Hold on.

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:43.539
Where is it?

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:46.539
Oh, found it.

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:49.539
I know Jehovah created all things.

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:52.539
But I still didn't get it.

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:54.539
So, we talked about you.

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:55.539
What?

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:57.539
Jehovah is like a parent.

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.539
So, we talked about all the good things you do.

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.539
You like to give me gifts?

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.540
Jehovah gives us gifts too.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:11.359
Because there's so many good things to enjoy.

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:14.359
Like the warm sunshine.

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:19.359
All the animals.

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:26.189
Our senses.

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.189
And so many other things.

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.189
He also listens to us.

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:33.189
I know I can talk to you about anything.

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.189
And I can do the same thing when I pray to Jehovah.

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.189
I know you love and care about me.

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:42.189
And that's how Jehovah feels about everyone.

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:45.189
And, well, that's basically it.

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:55.170
Do you want to learn more about the Bible?

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.170
Oh, well, I do learn some very nice things today.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.170
I do have some questions.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.170
Maybe we can talk about it next week.
