00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.779
This morning, we're going to look at this question.

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:06.740
What price are you willing to pay?

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.779
In today's text at Mark 10, 29 and 30,

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:14.939
Jesus made it clear that when a person chooses

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:19.100
to follow him, he or she might have to give up some things,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.219
including family relationships at times.

00:00:23.219 --> 00:00:24.980
As we know, this sometimes happens

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.780
when a person accepts the truth

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:30.980
and then his or her family rejects the message

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.340
and perhaps even him or her as a result.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.899
When this happens as painful as it is,

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.899
a sincere person will choose to stand firmly on Jehovah's side.

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:46.259
In fact, we'll give up whatever we must

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:49.020
in order to serve him faithfully, true.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.140
So what have you paid?

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.740
It's good for us to consider what we're willing to do

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.579
for Jehovah and his son.

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:58.219
They will bless us many times over

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.820
if we remain committed to following Jesus' example.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.859
And that's the point of today's text.

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:08.299
The fact is that many of our brothers and sisters

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.299
continue to serve Jehovah faithfully

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.579
despite having only a few family members

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:19.340
or perhaps no family members serving Jehovah along with them.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.900
At the same time,

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.540
others may have generations of relatives who have served God.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.219
And we rejoice with them

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:30.780
because they too are serving Jehovah faithfully.

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:34.659
The fact is that circumstances often affect

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.579
what a person may have to leave behind

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:39.939
or give up at times.

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:42.379
Jesus certainly knew that would be the case

00:01:42.379 --> 00:01:44.340
and that's why he said what he did.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.060
But no matter what we must endure,

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.099
Jehovah and his son will prove true

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:54.140
to the promise there in Mark chapter 10.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.620
The guarantees of 100-fold blessing

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.459
for those who are loyal and everlasting life.

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:05.739
What should that promise move us to do?

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.180
We should be moved to continue sacrificing

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.460
whatever is needed in order to continue doing God's will.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.659
That should be our prime motivation.

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:21.020
We're moved by faith and love to serve Jehovah

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.300
because he's so kind and he's so generous.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.060
And we remember that he too has sacrificed much for us.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.060
Move by faith, we refuse to become like Deemus

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.460
who you'll recall abandoned the Apostle Paul

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.379
when things got difficult, didn't he?

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.659
Deemus looked back at the things behind

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.659
and he lost sight of this point.

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:49.699
It's what we give and what we're willing to give up

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.379
in order to be loyal that matters to Jehovah.

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:58.379
What we give and what we give up says a lot about who we really are.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.099
So while what each of us may have to give

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.580
or give up at times will vary,

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.340
Jehovah will kindly give us more and return

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.219
than we can ever imagine.

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.539
Again, Jesus said at Mark 10.30,

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:15.740
100 times more, so to speak.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.259
When we keep that in mind,

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:23.259
we'll be helped to remain focused on Jesus promise in today's text.

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:27.060
Jesus himself remained focused on such words.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.060
For example, when his half-brothers did not put faith in him at first,

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.620
how did Jesus deal with that disappointment?

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.819
He never compromised his commitment to Jehovah's work

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.060
just to please others, even family.

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.219
At one point, Jesus said,

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:49.539
whoa, whenever all men speak well of you,

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.860
Jesus knew that those who try to please everyone in the world

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.860
while serving Jehovah always end up compromising their integrity.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.620
Jesus kept his integrity because he refused to be preoccupied

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.539
with what other people thought of him.

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:11.020
He was always most concerned with pleasing his Heavenly Father.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.740
What was an added benefit that resulted from Jesus' faithful course?

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:23.939
The scriptures tell us that his half-brothers eventually responded favorably,

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:29.939
especially it seems after witnessing the events involved with his death and resurrection.

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:37.019
Their view of Jesus and his teachings changed quickly when the right time arrived.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:43.339
Now, let's put all this together into a very specific context for many who are listening.

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:47.100
Many of you have unbelieving family members,

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.620
perhaps even your parents are not serving Jehovah along with you,

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.540
and this may be true for many years.

00:04:53.899 --> 00:04:59.899
What can you do to remain hopeful towards such family members even though the time is short?

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.220
The answer? Follow Jesus example.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:13.579
Like Jesus never give up on them, yet never compromise in your service to Jehovah just to please them.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.300
Keep setting a good example for them to see and to remember.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.980
As Jesus said at Matthew 5-16,

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.019
you'll note, he said there,

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.379
let your light shine before men,

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:33.980
so that they may see your fine works and give glory to your Father,

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.259
who is in the heavens.

00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:42.699
What do others, including unbelieving relatives, see when they look at us?

00:05:43.579 --> 00:05:48.779
Do they see that we're facing the future with confidence and that our faith is strong?

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:55.259
We build up our faith by praying for more of it every day,

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:58.779
and by being absorbed in God's Word every day.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.660
Those who may be starting to lean the right way will see this in us.

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:07.500
They will see that our faith is backed up by works.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:13.579
In turn, they may lean even more in the right direction.

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:17.740
We need to think about that since, as the saying goes,

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.699
our example may speak louder than words.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:29.819
Or as Jesus said, let them see your fine works and give glory to your Father, who is in the heavens.

00:06:31.019 --> 00:06:37.180
Still, realistically, we may continue to have some worry about our non-witness family members.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.660
We think about them because we love them.

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:46.699
We're concerned that they may not respond to the good news in time.

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:47.899
We worry about that.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.339
When such concerns come up into your mind and heart, remember this.

00:06:54.459 --> 00:06:58.060
Just as eventually happened with Jesus' half-brothers,

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:03.500
Jehovah can turn a heart very quickly when it is leaning the right way.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:09.019
Jehovah knows the leaning of every person on earth.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:14.699
Jesus knows this too, and he sees every potential sheep like one.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:23.500
With a positive view, then, continue helping your family members to lean the right way and then

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.259
leave the matter in Jehovah's hands.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:30.379
Keep trusting that he will draw them to himself if their heart condition is right.

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:37.259
Experience shows that sheep like ones tend to run in families.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:39.180
We'll repeat that.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:44.620
Experience shows that sheep like ones tend to run

00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:45.819
in families.

00:07:47.019 --> 00:07:49.339
This has proven to be true over and over again,

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:53.579
so remain patient and hopeful toward them.

00:07:54.779 --> 00:07:57.980
But what if your family members never respond?

00:07:58.620 --> 00:07:59.579
That could happen.

00:08:00.459 --> 00:08:04.779
Well, if that's the case, keep in mind that Jehovah knows what you've tried to do

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:08.220
and he will bless you forever for trying.

00:08:09.579 --> 00:08:13.180
So in review, what price are you willing to pay?

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:18.300
If we're following Jesus' example, we'll stand firmly on the side of the truth

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:24.620
and never allow anything to pull us away, even at great cost to ourselves,

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.740
even if it involves family relationships.

00:08:28.779 --> 00:08:35.419
When we keep our integrity, our example may move someone else to lean the right way

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:38.779
in the direction that Jehovah may draw him or her.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:45.100
If we're willing to sacrifice much in order to follow Jesus, what did he promise?

00:08:46.139 --> 00:08:52.299
A 100-fold blessing which today involves our international brotherhood,

00:08:52.299 --> 00:08:55.899
the only true brotherhood on earth.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.899
Along with this, he promised that in the coming system of things,

00:09:00.379 --> 00:09:05.419
his self-sacrificing followers will receive everlasting life.
