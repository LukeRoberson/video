00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:20.929
Billions of people have died throughout history, but the death of one person stands alone.

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:24.890
That of Jesus Christ.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.329
Why did he die?

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:30.690
Did his death have a purpose?

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.530
To find the answer, we need to go back to the beginning of human history.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:43.850
The Bible explains that God created the man Adam perfect without sin.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.890
He was free to eat from all the trees in the Garden of Eden except one.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.490
God gave the simple command not to eat from that particular tree.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:02.390
This tree symbolized God's right to set the standards of good and bad.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.950
As long as Adam remained obedient to Jehovah, he had the prospect of living forever

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.590
on a paradise earth.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.790
But Adam did not appreciate all the good things God had done for him.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.189
He chose to disobey God.

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.829
As a result, he lost the opportunity to live forever.

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:29.469
But he was not the only one affected.

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:33.989
All of his descendants have inherited the fatal effects of sin.

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:39.469
By themselves, humans could not break free from sin and death.

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:42.909
They needed someone to rescue them.

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.069
For this reason, Jehovah miraculously caused one of his perfect spirit's sons to come

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:53.939
to earth as a human.

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.500
Jesus was a perfect man, just as Adam had been.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.700
However, unlike Adam, Jesus remained obedient.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.379
Jesus allowed him to give his life as a ransom in exchange for many.

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.819
But how could the death of one man benefit all of mankind?

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:30.110
Well, imagine that the manager of a large factory steals money from the company.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:38.539
His actions plunge the company into debt, forcing it to shut down.

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:43.060
The workers lose their jobs and cannot pay their bills.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:50.699
He suffers because of that one man's corruption.

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:58.319
Now suppose a kind and generous man feels sorry for all those who are suffering.

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:06.039
He is moved to pay off the debt and reopen the company.

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:18.270
By canceling that one debt, he brings relief to all the employees and their families.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.270
Adam is like that corrupt manager.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:28.069
When he rebelled, he incurred a large debt of sin and passed it on to his children.

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.949
Jesus is like the generous man.

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:38.550
When he gave up his perfect human life, he paid off the debt of sin and reopened the prospect

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.870
of living forever for each of us.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.110
You may wonder, did Jesus really exist?

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.949
Is believing in Jesus enough for salvation?

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:55.460
Is Jesus God?

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:03.099
