00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.799
Well, before his death, Jesus warned all of those who would be his followers in the future that they would be

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:10.119
objects of persecution.

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:16.359
In Matthew chapter 10, you remember what Jesus said. Let's read this together. Matthew chapter 10 verse 22

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.899
And you will be hated of verse 22 and you will be hated by all people on account of my name

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.699
But the one who has endured to the end will be saved when they persecute you in one city flee to another

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:38.020
For truly I say to you you will by no means complete the circuit of the cities of Israel until the Son of Man arrives

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:40.979
Well, interestingly almost

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:47.899
Immediately after the Holy Spirit had been poured out and Jehovah began to select his anointed congregation

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:57.820
Those newly anointed disciples became the targets of intense persecution. You remember what happened in Acts chapter 4?

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.630
Let's read this Acts chapter 4 and verse 1

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:11.689
It says while the two were speaking to the people the priests the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came up to them

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.989
These were annoyed because the Apostles were teaching the people were openly declaring the resurrection of

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:25.950
Jesus from the dead so they seized them and took them into custody until the next day for it was already

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:28.870
evening and then if you turn over to chapter 5

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:38.069
And verse 17 we remember the words it says but the high priest rose and all those with him who are of the sect of the

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:45.909
Sadducees and they were filled with jealousy and they seized the Apostles and put them in the public jail

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.909
Well, that's the beginning. That's the very very beginning of the Christian congregation

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.750
Intense persecution right from day one

00:01:56.629 --> 00:02:03.709
Well roughly about 25 years later in about the year 59 CE when the Apostle Paul arrived in Rome

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:11.990
By that time the prominent Jews in the city that Paul met with had heard much about the early Christians

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.990
Do you remember what they said?

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.789
Acts chapter 28

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.789
and verse 22

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:23.250
It says but the these are prominent Jews said to Paul

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:30.210
But we think at property here from you what your thoughts are for truly as regards this sect

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:35.810
We know that it is spoken against everywhere. Isn't that interesting?

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:42.129
So they called it a sect and they said it was spoken against everywhere

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.569
Well, what were some of the accusations

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.729
That were brought against the early Christians

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.210
While writing of the Christians in that first century period in the Roman Empire historian K. S.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:03:04.129
La Tourette said this the accusations varied because they refused to participate in pagan ceremonies the Christians were dubbed atheists

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.009
Through their abstention for much of community life the pagan festivals the public amusements they were

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:14.009
Derided as haters of the human race

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:19.530
The fact that the memorial of Christ's death was celebrated only in the presence of believers

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:26.849
Fed the rumors that Christians regularly sacrificed an infant and consumed its blood and flesh

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.969
In addition because the early Christians refused to practice emperor worship

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:37.210
They were accused of being enemies of the state

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:39.969
Well, does that all sound familiar?

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.849
We've heard things much like that recently. Haven't we?

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.650
Well, much time has passed since these events in the first century

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:58.889
But the murderous hatred that Satan the devil has for all faithful servants of Jehovah God is still very much active in this earth

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:05.689
And we're not surprised by that. Do you remember what revelation chapter 12 and verse 17 says let's read it

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:10.169
Revelation 12 and verse 17

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:16.290
It says so the dragon became wrath enraged at the woman and

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:23.449
Went off to wage war with the remaining ones of her offspring who observed the commandments of God and

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.730
Have the work of bearing witness

00:04:26.209 --> 00:04:27.930
concerning Jesus

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.689
Well, do you see the point you see as a result of remaining faithful the remaining

00:04:34.329 --> 00:04:41.810
Anointed ones who are on the earth and all of those who associate with them and who support them in their work are in a war

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:47.490
a literal war against Satan the devil and the wicked spirit forces

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:50.009
now recently

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:54.129
We've seen the devil's attack on Jehovah's people in the country of Russia

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.569
Just yesterday the Interfax News agency reported that

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:03.490
Metropolitan Hilarion head of the Russian Orthodox

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:08.009
Sonotal Department for external church relations said this

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:15.449
Jehovah's Witnesses do not believe in Jesus Christ as the God and the Savior

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:22.170
They do not recognize the doctrine of the Trinity. Therefore, they cannot be called Christians

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:28.410
He stated that he welcomed the court ruling of the Russian Supreme Court and

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:36.250
Suggested that the pernicious and harmful influence of Jehovah's Witnesses would now start to decline

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.730
Well, can you hear the hatred of the devil in those comments?

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.850
But just as there have always been

00:05:45.209 --> 00:05:47.689
Opposers of Jehovah's faithful servants

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:57.850
There have also been individuals like Gamelio that Jehovah has raised up who have come to the defense of Jehovah's people now some of these people

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:00.569
Do not love Jehovah's Witnesses

00:06:01.209 --> 00:06:06.889
But for their own purposes they're willing to defend God's people just take this example

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:16.329
Andre Kareyev a proto-deacon of the Russian Orthodox Church and a professor of their spiritual academy in Moscow

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:20.449
He's a very very outspoken critic of Jehovah's Witnesses

00:06:20.649 --> 00:06:24.610
But after the decision of the Russian Supreme Court, this is what he said

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:33.089
I argued that state agencies should not cooperate with this sect and I do not retract my words

00:06:33.769 --> 00:06:38.250
But to accuse them of extremism that is not even funny

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:42.050
Such a decision is nothing other than idiotic

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:48.449
A waste to accuse pacifists of extremism. Isn't that something?

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.850
Yesterday it was very amazing to me to see a news conference in Russia

00:06:54.329 --> 00:07:00.810
where German Chancellor Angela Merkel was on a podium with Russian President Vladimir Putin

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.410
There a Chancellor Merkel said

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:13.689
That she asked Mr. Putin to utilize his influence to protect minority rights as well as in the case of Jehovah's Witnesses

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:22.329
Well, my eyes almost fell out of my head as I saw Chancellor Merkel say that in the presence of President Putin of Russia

00:07:23.329 --> 00:07:27.449
Well, there are many others who are willing to come to the defense of Jehovah's people

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:34.410
Last week when I was in the Kazakhstan a professor came to attend our talk for the entire country

00:07:34.649 --> 00:07:36.250
He sat right in the front row

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:41.170
He's written a book about Jehovah's Witnesses and is very eager always to defend us

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:48.970
He wanted to speak to me and so he came backstage. We talked for about 15 or 20 minutes and he asked me what you know

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.970
What do you think is the source of all of these

00:07:51.689 --> 00:07:57.930
Bad reports about Jehovah's Witnesses and I said to the professor. I said well, Professor

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:02.089
Anyone who truly knows Jehovah's Witnesses

00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:06.329
Recognizes that all of these accusations are completely

00:08:07.209 --> 00:08:08.410
Ridiculous

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:17.610
Well, the professor looked at me and he's a very distinguished white-haired man of probably about 60 or 70 years of age and he says to me

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:20.610
I know Jehovah's Witnesses

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:24.649
And I know that those charges are ridiculous

00:08:25.209 --> 00:08:29.930
Isn't it wonderful that we have people like this who are willing to stand up for God's people

00:08:30.889 --> 00:08:34.490
Well in spite of the hatred that's been spewed forth by the devil

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:41.610
It is amazing to see that persecution never ever stops God's faithful servants

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:45.450
It has never stopped them in the past and it will not stop them in the future

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:48.649
In fact, what did Jesus say here in Matthew chapter 5

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.740
Matthew chapter 5

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:02.279
And verse 11

00:09:02.279 --> 00:09:13.320
Happy are you when people reproach you and persecute you and lieingly say every sort of wicked thing against you for my sake

00:09:13.879 --> 00:09:19.720
Rejoice and be overjoyed since your reward is great in the heavens

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:24.360
For in that way they persecuted the prophets prior to you

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.559
Well, that's the attitude of true Christians

00:09:28.039 --> 00:09:33.559
We know we're doing the right thing when we incur the hatred of these agents of the devil

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.440
Well one thing that brought me joy last week when I was in Russia and also in Kazakhstan

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:43.879
Was I heard so many reports from brothers and sisters saying that inactive ones

00:09:44.519 --> 00:09:46.279
former Bible students

00:09:46.279 --> 00:09:51.799
Relatives of witnesses are all contacting the brothers wanting to become involved again in the truth

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:57.159
Because of what they see happening in Russia. They know the end is close at hand

00:09:58.279 --> 00:10:02.519
So while we keep on praying on behalf of our brothers who are being persecuted

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:09.720
How vital it is brothers that we keep on the watch that we continue to watch what's happening around the world

00:10:09.799 --> 00:10:12.279
being very alert to world events

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:20.039
eagerly awaiting the time when our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will appear and deliver us from this world

00:10:20.039 --> 00:10:23.320
That is so firmly in the hands of the devil
