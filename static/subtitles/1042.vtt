WEBVTT

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:03.200
In the third talk of this convention,

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.200
Brother Numeir asked,

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.880
have you experienced financial setback?

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.720
Has your child faced peer pressure

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.960
and we could add or bullying in school?

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.280
Do you have a life-threatening disease?

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.679
We'd like to continue that list.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.079
Do you face scorn from workmates?

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.920
Do you have a personality issue with someone?

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.640
Do family members taunt you?

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.520
Was we deal with various trials?

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.920
We might recall the words of Paul.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.640
He said, the way I'm aiming my blows,

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.039
is so as not to be striking the air.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.640
Well, how do we counteract the adversities of this system?

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.000
Please find first Samuel chapter one.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.960
Hannah had two adversities.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.039
And they were like, boom, boom.

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.600
One two punch designed to drop her for the count.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.599
The first one is in verse two of chapter one.

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:12.439
Alcana had two wives.

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.680
One was named Hannah and the other was named Penina.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.480
Well, that's polygamy.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.599
And Penina loathed, she hated Hannah.

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:23.200
Well, it was a second problem.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.599
It continues, Penina had children,

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:29.840
but Hannah had no children.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.439
Hannah was barren and in that culture,

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.840
this was a bitter reproach for a woman.

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:41.159
Well, it was devious, uncouth,

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.640
Penina really like.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.000
Let's read verse six.

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.560
Moreover, her rival wife pondered her relentlessly

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.200
in order to upset her, she did this on purpose

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.120
because Jehovah had not given her children

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.319
and look at the end of verse seven.

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:00.120
Her rival would taunt her so much

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.120
that Hannah would weep and not eat.

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:07.439
Well, as you watch the following artwork,

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.039
imagine Hannah's distressing circumstance

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.860
and then how faith turned it all around.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.460
I couldn't sleep or eat.

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:24.139
I felt my hopes and dreams flipping away,

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.259
but even if no one else really understood me,

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:30.539
I knew Jehovah would.

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:34.819
I told him everything.

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.939
I knew that the God of justice

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:41.020
would set all matters right in his own time

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.699
and in his own way.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.620
Jehovah answered my prayer in such a wonderful way.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.139
I never forgot where this incredible blessing

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:53.139
had come from.

00:02:54.699 --> 00:03:01.860
There is no rock like our God.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.900
Did you see the grief on Hannah's face

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.099
in that first picture?

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:10.020
The next piece of art, she's peaceful and tranquil

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.939
and she's voicing her faith in Jehovah her rock.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.780
From despair to calmness of heart, how did that happen?

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:22.500
Verses 10 and 11.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.580
She demonstrated faith in several ways

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.620
and we can do the same as we face our own boom boom,

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.979
one two punch of trials and frustrations of life.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:35.620
Verses 10.

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:39.500
Hannah was extremely bitter

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.620
and she began to pray to Jehovah

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.500
and to weep uncontrollably.

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:49.860
She was extremely bitter, but she prayed.

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:54.860
She cried uncontrollably, but she prayed to Jehovah

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.900
and you're agonizing circumstances

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.020
no matter how agitated, find a quiet place

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.860
if only in your mind and pour out your heart to Jehovah.

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:13.219
Well, how else did Hannah show her faith?

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:18.379
Well, in that very prayer, she did ask Jehovah for a blessing,

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:21.899
but she also promised to give him something in return.

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:26.649
Verses 11 and she made this vow,

00:04:27.649 --> 00:04:29.649
O Jehovah of armies,

00:04:29.649 --> 00:04:33.649
if you look upon the affliction of your servant and remember me

00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:36.649
and you do not forget your servant

00:04:36.649 --> 00:04:40.649
and give to your servant a male child,

00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:43.649
I will give him to Jehovah all the days of his life

00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:46.649
and no razor will touch his head.

00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:51.649
Yes, she was going to give her son

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:55.649
as a Nazareth from birth to serve Jehovah all his days.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.449
A sterling example of faith.

00:05:00.769 --> 00:05:04.009
Well, what else likely strengthened Hannah's faith?

00:05:05.209 --> 00:05:08.850
Examples of faithful women who came before her

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.370
with similar circumstances.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.410
Do you remember Rachel and her sister, Leah?

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.970
They were both married to Jacob and like Hannah,

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.050
Rachel had no children and there were issues

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.370
between the two because of this,

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.370
but you see Hannah could look back on that example

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.209
and see how Jehovah helped faithful Rachel to prosper.

00:05:33.209 --> 00:05:35.170
It bolstered her faith.

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:38.889
Well, what's another way that Hannah showed faith?

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.490
Well, despite being distraught,

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.089
so distraught that she would weep and could not eat,

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:48.449
she continued her spiritual routine.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.529
Verses 11 says that she would go to the tabernacle

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:54.810
faithfully year after year.

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:00.850
13 through 16, she was misjudged by the high priest,

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.490
but she continued her spiritual routine.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.529
Now, as we said at the outset,

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.930
the punches that life throws us are different from Hannah's,

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.170
but we too can have the same strong faith that she did.

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:19.769
Now in the following dramatization,

00:06:19.769 --> 00:06:22.089
though the trial is different,

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:24.810
note how the sister shows faith

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:33.339
like that of Hannah.

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:56.550
I could tell from the doctor's voice, the news wasn't good.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:27.240
I just didn't expect my health to worsen so quickly.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:33.170
I tried to act like everything was fine,

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:55.139
but I was fine that I wasn't into Jehovah.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:02.699
Just knowing he would listen and understand

00:08:02.699 --> 00:08:04.420
that's what got me through.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:14.259
No one really knew what I was going through.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:33.909
Not even my friends.

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:40.059
I felt like Hannah totally misunderstood,

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:48.940
but she had faith that Jehovah would set matters straight.

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:55.820
And he did for Hannah and for me, but more than that,

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.019
he reminded me that I wouldn't have to deal

00:09:00.019 --> 00:09:07.279
with this illness alone.

00:09:07.279 --> 00:09:10.080
The sister's circumstances were different,

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.399
but she drew strength from Hannah's strong faith in Jehovah.

00:09:15.399 --> 00:09:17.440
No matter what the circumstances are trial,

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:22.399
how can we imitate the example of that faith?

00:09:22.399 --> 00:09:23.399
Well, there's many different ways,

00:09:23.399 --> 00:09:24.799
but let's review a few.

00:09:24.799 --> 00:09:29.799
First Peter 5.9, Satan tries to beat us up and knock us down,

00:09:31.039 --> 00:09:33.080
but we're not alone.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.360
There are others who experience the same trials.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:44.139
First Peter 5.9, but take your stand against him,

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.419
firm in the faith,

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:48.779
knowing that the same kind of sufferings

00:09:48.779 --> 00:09:52.259
are being experienced by the entire association

00:09:52.259 --> 00:09:53.740
of your brothers in the world.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.539
Reflect on Jehovah's dealings with other faithful ones,

00:09:57.539 --> 00:10:01.620
both in the past and in the present day.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:06.299
Now in 1 Samuel 112, it says that Hannah prayed

00:10:06.299 --> 00:10:08.700
for a long time before Jehovah.

00:10:09.539 --> 00:10:13.539
We too can gain relief through fervent, persistent

00:10:13.539 --> 00:10:15.059
and specific prayers.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.820
Colossians 4 says, persevere in prayer.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:24.659
When we pray to Jehovah, leave it with him,

00:10:24.659 --> 00:10:26.460
confident that he will help.

00:10:27.379 --> 00:10:30.779
And recall that Hannah was extremely bitter.

00:10:30.779 --> 00:10:32.620
She was crying uncontrollably,

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:37.139
but after she poured her feelings out to Jehovah,

00:10:37.139 --> 00:10:41.379
verse 18 says, she went on her way and ate

00:10:41.419 --> 00:10:44.059
and her face was no longer downcast.

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.980
And then after Jehovah acted in her behalf,

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:51.980
Hannah remembered that and she went back to Jehovah in prayer

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:56.220
and prayed the beautiful prayer in 1 Samuel 2.

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:01.659
Finally, like Hannah, even if discouraged,

00:11:01.659 --> 00:11:05.259
we need to maintain a good spiritual routine.

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:09.940
If we allow distress to paralyze us,

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.539
in effect, we become a stationary punching bag for Satan.

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.299
Stay nimble on your feet spiritually,

00:11:18.299 --> 00:11:20.779
active in your theocratic routine.

00:11:22.059 --> 00:11:25.860
And like Paul, aim your blows, do not strike the air,

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.820
fight back against Satan in his tactics.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:34.059
If we do all these things, our bond with Jehovah

00:11:34.059 --> 00:11:35.779
will grow ever stronger.

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:40.779
And Jehovah will reward our faith like he did for Hannah.

00:11:45.139 --> 00:11:46.820
And now Brother Harold Corcoran,

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.700
a helper for the publishing committee,

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:51.700
will present the next talk of this symposium,

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:56.700
imitate women of strong faith, the captive Israelite girl.
