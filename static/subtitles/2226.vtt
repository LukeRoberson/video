00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.580
There have been certain pivotal events in the modern

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.580
Theocratic history of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.580
The Countdowns are invented.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.580
Their kings have had their day.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.579
Advertise, advertise, advertise the king and his kingdom.

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:27.579
May it be known that we are Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:32.579
The New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures.

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.619
October 5, 2013.

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:41.619
Jersey City Assembly Hall, USA.

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:46.619
The program was streamed to 1,830 locations

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:50.619
in the English-speaking territories of seven branches.

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:55.619
Well, what can we expect at this 129th annual meeting?

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:59.619
Well, food at the proper time be served.

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:02.619
Well, Bible truths be refined.

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:03.619
Absolutely.

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:06.620
Mark Sanderson, a member of the governing body,

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.620
warmed hearts and ignited excitement,

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.620
announcing a new Bible display.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.620
We truly love the Bible.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.620
And so the chosen theme for this display would be

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.620
the Bible and the divine name.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.620
We want to invite you all to come

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.620
and see this beautiful display.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.620
Garrett Loesch of the governing body

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.620
summarized the week's lesson from the watchtower.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.620
You have been washed clean.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.620
You have been sanctified.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.620
Program chairman and governing body member Guy Pierce

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.620
announced the year text for 2014.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.620
Matthew 6, verse 10.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.620
Let your kingdom come.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.510
Two video presentations follow.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.510
The first, a precious gift from Jehovah,

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.510
traced events leading up to the production

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.510
of the New World translation of the Holy Scriptures

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:09.509
and highlighted its value to lovers of God's word worldwide.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.509
So we would like to travel down memory lane with you.

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:16.509
In the second video, Samuel heard of the governing body

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:20.509
interviewed four long-time members of the U.S. Bethel family

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:23.509
who were present at the New World Translations'

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:25.509
initial release in 1950.

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:28.509
That evening when Brother Nor raised high,

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:30.509
that volume of the New World Translation

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:32.509
and announced the release.

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:35.509
And there was so much excitement, everybody.

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:37.509
Marrowing that historic event,

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:39.509
governing body member Jeffrey Jackson,

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:41.509
delivered a talk that would provide another

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:43.509
theocratic milestone.

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:46.509
And we're pleased to announce at this annual meeting

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:48.509
that the work on this revision

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:50.509
recently was completed.

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:52.509
You don't have to wait at all.

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:56.509
Here it is, the newly released revised edition

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:59.509
of the New World Translation.

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:16.719
We're sure it will touch your hearts.

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:20.719
It will motivate you to hear God's word

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:25.719
in your own language, 21st century English.

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:33.849
Well, now you have it in your hands.

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:36.849
Likely, some of you are going through trying to open to pages

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:38.849
that is gilded and it's kind of hard to open.

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:40.849
Maybe it's nothing to help you.

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:45.849
Hold your Bible in your two hands and give it a twist.

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:48.849
During this part, I'm not going to have you

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:51.849
twist God's word like Brother Pierce had you do.

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:56.090
Stephen Let of the governing body

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.090
next detailed several features of the revised edition

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.090
of the New World Translation,

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.090
which will be useful in the ministry and in personal study.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.090
That in this revised edition,

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.090
the name Jehovah appears six more times than previously.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.090
U.S. Branch Committee member, John Ekran,

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.089
sustained the excitement by demonstrating the use

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:22.089
of the newly released JW Library app on computers

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:24.089
and mobile devices.

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:26.089
It's really been designed to help you

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:30.089
to study the Bible along with the text.

00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:34.089
We think you're going to find that this application

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:38.089
is going to be the ideal digital companion

00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:40.089
to the Bible that you now have in your hand.

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:43.089
In the talk, translating God's word

00:04:43.089 --> 00:04:45.089
so as to convey correct meaning,

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:47.089
governing body member Anthony Morris

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:50.089
outlined the translation principles used.

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:52.089
For a good translation of the Bible

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:56.089
makes the message it contains understandable to sincere people

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:59.089
regardless of their background.

00:04:59.089 --> 00:05:01.089
When you get into your Bible reading it,

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:04.089
you're going to see that the New World Translation Committee

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:07.089
was guided by these principles.

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:10.089
So we encourage you, brothers and sisters,

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:13.089
feast at Jehovah's Table, enjoy and rejoice

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:16.089
in this wonderful gift God's given to all of us,

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:21.089
the revised New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:24.089
In the final talk of the day,

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:29.089
governing body member David Spleen showed how the revised New World Translation

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:33.089
affects our understanding even of Jehovah's name.

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:35.089
Did you get the point?

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:38.089
It's not just a matter of Jehovah's becoming

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:41.089
whatever he needs to become.

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:43.089
That would limit Jehovah.

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:46.089
But Jehovah can also cause his creation

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:49.089
to become whatever he chooses.

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:53.089
And yes, the great Jehovah can cause you

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:56.089
to succeed at any assignment he gives you

00:05:56.089 --> 00:06:00.089
whether at Bethel or in the field.

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:03.089
So our prayer is that your reading

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:07.089
and study of the revised New World Translation

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:12.089
will draw you closer, ever closer to Jehovah

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:18.089
and may he ever be your father, your God, and your friend.
