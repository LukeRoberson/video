00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:15.539
They say that a healthy mind lives in a healthy body, and I take good care of mine, not

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:19.940
a day without exercising.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.300
And I do my best to stick to a spiritual routine too.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.539
Oh no, the meeting for field service, I've got to get going.

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:37.490
By the way, my name is Ryan.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.369
I'm glad I could work with Andrew this morning.

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:44.130
He's always so well prepared for the ministry.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.649
You see, I'm not so good at starting conversations with people I don't know.

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.969
And then it's great to have Andrew on your team.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.170
He's really good at that.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.729
And once we're done here, I'm off into the woods for a long hike.

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:06.569
It's like the only place I can recharge my batteries.

00:01:06.569 --> 00:01:12.219
Andrew suggests that we first do some of my return visits.

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:16.219
Well, I'm afraid I don't have any.

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:24.349
Sorry Andrew, maybe next weekend.

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:31.629
I like our meetings, but I wish I'd prepared better.

00:01:31.629 --> 00:01:36.920
Now the study is over, and again, I couldn't comment.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.359
Man, I need to be at the cinema in 10 minutes.

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:44.239
Oh yeah, thanks, Edgar.

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:46.959
My field service report.

00:01:46.959 --> 00:02:00.659
My group overseer always has to remind me, how can I always forget?

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.060
Andrew and I are good friends.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:11.069
To be honest, he seems to be the only friend I've got in our congregation.

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.909
Last week, he was appointed as a ministerial servant.

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.189
I'm not surprised at all.

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:22.509
He is a great example, especially for me.

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:33.860
I wonder why I haven't qualified to be a ministerial servant.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.580
Andrew's always busy for the congregation, helping the friends,

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.860
taking care of our older brothers and sisters.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.520
He really cares for them.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.120
How come I never think of that?

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.319
That evening, Edgar and Martin, the assistant group overseer, came over.

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.800
They've noticed how hard I train to stay in good shape physically.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.680
But am I working as hard to be in good shape spiritually?

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.879
Martin reminded me of 1 Timothy 3-1.

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.680
This statement is trustworthy.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.840
If a man is reaching out to be an overseer,

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.169
he is desirous of a fine work.

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:23.210
This principle applies to me since an overseer

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.289
qualifies first as a ministerial servant.

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:31.449
The brothers asked me, how is the apostle Paul an example to someone

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:35.280
who's desirous of a fine work?

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.800
Paul strengthened the friends by giving encouraging talks.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.199
He showed personal interest for the elderly,

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:55.689
for the fatherless boys, and had a good share in the ministry.

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:58.129
The brothers were right.

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:02.849
Having a good share in the ministry gives so much happiness.

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.969
Edgar commended me for how I handled that last return visit.

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:08.050
Who knows?

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.659
Maybe I will conduct a Bible study soon.

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:18.259
I didn't realize that we had so many nice friends in our congregation.

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:22.100
Perhaps I just didn't give them a chance in the past.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.899
I guess I had a spiritual routine before,

00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:28.300
but I was too distracted by what I wanted to do.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.420
But there is so much I can do for others.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.180
With better preparation, I feel more comfortable giving comments.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.819
And I was able to stand in for a part during the midweek meeting.

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:45.019
Martin gave me some great advice afterwards.

00:04:45.019 --> 00:04:51.459
The apostle Paul worked hard, gave to others, and reached out.

00:04:51.459 --> 00:04:59.740
Following his example gives me so much joy in life.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.620
Now I realize what it really means to reach out.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.420
It's all about being a spiritual man.
