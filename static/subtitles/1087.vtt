00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.710
Greetings, brothers and sisters.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.710
Today's session will begin with a music video presentation.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.710
If you have a cell phone or other electronic device,

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.710
please adjust it to a setting that will not disturb others.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.710
We now encourage you to watch and listen to the music video presentation,

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.710
which shows the joy that comes from disciple making.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.710
Please enjoy.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:10:21.860
Welcome to the next session of this always-rejoice, regional convention.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.860
During this session and the next one,

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:29.860
you will hear the talks listed under the Saturday heading of your printed program.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:34.860
The scripture theme for today's program is taken from Psalm 105, verse 3,

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:36.860
where we read,

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:39.860
both about his holy name,

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:44.860
let the hearts of those seeking Jehovah rejoice.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:48.860
We will focus on improving our skills as disciplesmakers,

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:53.860
and we will see how the disciple making work leads to joy.

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:58.860
We now invite all to stand and share in singing song number 53, entitled,

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.860
Preparing to Preach.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:04.860
After the song, you may pause the program to ask Jehovah for his blessing

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.860
on our day's activity.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:13:51.179
Again, that song number 53.

00:13:51.179 --> 00:13:52.179
Please be seated.

00:13:52.179 --> 00:13:58.740
To make disciples, we must be effective preachers and teachers.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.740
How can you stimulate interest in the kingdom message,

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:04.740
and then help that interest to grow?

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:09.740
Our first symposium of this session will consider six necessary skills.

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:13.740
Each speaker will introduce the one to follow.

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:18.740
Please give your attention to Brother David Schaeffer, a helper to the teaching committee.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:20.740
He will begin with the theme,

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:26.740
Experience the joy of disciple making, improve your skills, asking questions.

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:38.620
How do you feel about doing things that you do well?

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:43.620
Have you ever noticed that people who are experts at what they do seem to enjoy the job,

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:47.620
whatever it is, and they delight in training others?

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:52.620
This is because the more people there are who understand how to support a project,

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.620
make music, or play a game,

00:14:54.620 --> 00:15:00.620
the more enjoyable it is when we combine forces as a group, a team, an orchestra.

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:06.620
There's a direct correlation between skill and joy.

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:10.620
So how do you feel about the work of making disciples?

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:14.620
Turn with me, please, to Luke chapter 10.

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:17.620
Jesus loved making disciples.

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:22.620
Psalm 40 and verse 8 says prophetically concerning Jesus to do your will,

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:26.620
oh my God, is my delight.

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:32.620
And notice here that Luke 10.21 tells us that when Jesus was contemplating the results

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:35.620
of a particular preaching campaign,

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:42.620
He became overjoyed, overjoyed in the Holy Spirit.

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:46.620
Jesus was a masterful teacher, but as this chapter of the Bible shows,

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:51.620
He helped His disciples to become skillful as well.

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:58.620
And thus, as pointed out at Luke 10.17, they also found joy in this work.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:03.620
Our joy grows as we work to improve our skills.

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:09.620
So this symposium will discuss six essential skills that can help us to become

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:15.620
not just more effective preachers, but effective disciple makers.

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.620
What skills are required?

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:20.620
You see them listed on your program?

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:24.620
Asking questions, unleashing the power of God's Word,

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:32.620
illustrating key points, teaching with enthusiasm, showing empathy, and reaching the heart.

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:38.620
This symposium includes a series of dramatizations that follow the progress of one Bible student,

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:44.620
after each video will discuss the skill that was featured and how we can use it.

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:50.620
This will help us to experience more joy in our disciple making work.

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:51.620
Are you ready?

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:54.620
Let's discuss our first skill.

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:58.620
Asking questions, why should we ask questions?

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.620
Questions serve a number of purposes.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:06.619
Sometimes we pose them just to stimulate interest and to get the conversation rolling.

00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:13.619
At other times, we're interested in hearing how a person thinks so that we can know better how to direct the conversation.

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:17.619
A turn with me, please, to Matthew chapter 22.

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:20.619
Jesus knew what was in man.

00:17:20.619 --> 00:17:26.619
He could read hearts, so he didn't need people to tell him where they stood on certain issues.

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:33.619
Still, he used questions to encourage his listeners to reason things out for themselves.

00:17:34.619 --> 00:17:41.619
Notice how he did that here in Matthew chapter 22 verses 41 through 45.

00:17:41.619 --> 00:17:47.900
Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.900
What do you think about the Christ?

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.900
Whose son is he?

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.900
They said to him, David's.

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:56.900
He asked them.

00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:02.900
How is it then that David under inspiration calls him Lord, saying,

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:09.900
Jehovah said to my Lord, sit at my right hand until I put your enemies beneath your feet.

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:15.900
If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.900
Four questions.

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:24.900
Now wouldn't it have been easier, quicker, just to tell people the answers?

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:25.900
Possibly.

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:31.900
But those questions led honest-hearted ones to draw accurate conclusions for themselves,

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:36.900
while at the same time revealing the true motives of opposers.

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.900
Questions are powerful.

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:46.900
But when we use them, we should keep in mind the words of James 119.

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:50.900
Notice what this says, James 119.

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.900
Know this, my beloved brothers.

00:18:53.900 --> 00:19:01.900
Everyone must be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger.

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:07.900
To ask a question without waiting for the answer would be like making an appointment to meet a friend,

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.900
but then leaving before he arrived.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:14.900
It was our question, so we should wait for the answer.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:16.900
Wait for it.

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:21.900
Not in a way that makes people feel uncomfortable, but by listening kindly.

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:28.900
By listening, we, in effect, say, you are important to me.

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:32.900
Now, unlike Jesus, we don't already know what's going on inside of people,

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:38.900
so it's not until they answer our question that we can tailor our comments to fit their situation.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:45.900
In the following dramatization, notice how a disciple maker uses questions skillfully.

00:19:45.900 --> 00:21:28.220
I'm sorry, what?

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:31.220
Your science says learn Bible truths.

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:36.220
So, I assume you're here to share said truths, so share one.

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:40.220
My name's Nita, what's yours?

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:41.220
Jade.

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:43.220
Like the stone?

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:46.220
No, like I'm jaded.

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:50.369
Are you going to share something or what?

00:21:50.369 --> 00:21:56.609
Yeah, did you know the Bible says you can live forever?

00:21:56.609 --> 00:21:59.609
Heaven, that's what you're sharing.

00:21:59.609 --> 00:22:01.609
That's not exactly new, is it?

00:22:01.609 --> 00:22:05.609
No, I mean, did you know the Bible says you can live forever on earth?

00:22:05.609 --> 00:22:07.609
But why would I want that?

00:22:07.609 --> 00:22:09.609
This place is a mess.

00:22:09.609 --> 00:22:11.609
But it won't be in the future.

00:22:11.609 --> 00:22:14.609
Revelation 21 verse 4 promises,

00:22:14.609 --> 00:22:18.609
and he will wipe out every tear from their eyes,

00:22:18.609 --> 00:22:20.609
and death will be no more.

00:22:20.609 --> 00:22:24.609
Neither will morning nor outcry, nor pain be anymore.

00:22:24.609 --> 00:22:27.609
The former things have passed away.

00:22:27.609 --> 00:22:31.609
Since there's no death or pain in heaven,

00:22:31.609 --> 00:22:36.230
where would this promise to play?

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:39.410
The earth.

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:43.490
I didn't know the Bible said that.

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:46.380
Look it.

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:47.380
I mean, that's cool.

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:48.380
Oh, okay.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:52.380
Would you like to learn how to be part of that future?

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:53.380
Uh, yeah.

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:55.380
Um, thanks.

00:22:55.380 --> 00:23:00.380
I'm not really the churchy type, and I'm late, so see you later.

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:09.619
Did you notice how Nita prefaced some of her questions?

00:23:09.619 --> 00:23:11.619
Did you know?

00:23:11.619 --> 00:23:15.619
Did you know the Bible says you can live forever?

00:23:15.619 --> 00:23:19.619
No, I mean, did you know the Bible says you can live forever on earth?

00:23:19.619 --> 00:23:24.619
A thought-provoking question to get the conversation started.

00:23:24.619 --> 00:23:28.619
Now, maybe it's been a little while since you were able to stand in a public place

00:23:28.619 --> 00:23:31.619
with a witnessing card as we saw Nita doing here.

00:23:31.619 --> 00:23:37.619
But we can have conversations on the phone, perhaps in stores, in the park.

00:23:37.619 --> 00:23:40.619
Questions also work well in letters.

00:23:40.619 --> 00:23:45.619
Of course, it's easy for us to think of questions on topics that interest us.

00:23:45.619 --> 00:23:51.619
But what is needed is to think of questions that others will enjoy answering.

00:23:51.619 --> 00:23:53.619
Such questions as,

00:23:53.619 --> 00:23:59.619
Did you know that the Bible describes a time when sickness will be no more?

00:23:59.619 --> 00:24:03.619
Do you think we'll ever see true economic security?

00:24:03.619 --> 00:24:06.619
It would be nice to be able to plan.

00:24:06.619 --> 00:24:11.619
What do you think is a reliable source of information about the future?

00:24:11.619 --> 00:24:16.619
Do you think we could be living in what the Bible calls the last days?

00:24:16.619 --> 00:24:21.619
I've noticed that many people still pray, especially when they have problems.

00:24:21.619 --> 00:24:25.619
Do you think anyone listens to prayers?

00:24:25.619 --> 00:24:28.619
Does God listen to all prayers?

00:24:28.619 --> 00:24:30.619
Viewpoint questions.

00:24:30.619 --> 00:24:34.619
Viewpoint questions invite people to express their thoughts.

00:24:34.619 --> 00:24:37.619
Often, Jesus would pause,

00:24:37.619 --> 00:24:39.619
ask people what they thought,

00:24:39.619 --> 00:24:42.619
and then listen to their response.

00:24:42.619 --> 00:24:45.619
For example, after the death of Martha's brother Lazarus,

00:24:45.619 --> 00:24:50.619
Jesus told her as recorded in John chapter 11 verses 25 and 26.

00:24:50.619 --> 00:24:55.619
Everyone who is living and exercises faith in me will never die at all.

00:24:55.619 --> 00:24:58.619
But then he asked her,

00:24:58.619 --> 00:25:02.619
Do you believe this?

00:25:02.619 --> 00:25:06.619
And then he listened as she expressed her faith.

00:25:06.619 --> 00:25:11.619
This type of question can be very effective in our disciple-making work.

00:25:11.619 --> 00:25:16.619
Or, like Jesus, we can use a series of questions to help people reason.

00:25:16.619 --> 00:25:21.619
In the video, did you notice how after reading Revelation 214,

00:25:21.619 --> 00:25:22.619
Nita asked Jade,

00:25:22.619 --> 00:25:25.619
Since there's no death or pain in heaven,

00:25:25.619 --> 00:25:28.619
where would this promise apply?

00:25:28.619 --> 00:25:31.619
And then she asked,

00:25:31.619 --> 00:25:36.619
Would you like to learn how to be a part of that future?

00:25:36.619 --> 00:25:41.619
We improve our skills by imitating Jesus.

00:25:41.619 --> 00:25:45.619
And as our skill improves, our joy increases.

00:25:45.619 --> 00:25:49.619
Jesus delighted to make disciples and we can too.

00:25:49.619 --> 00:25:53.619
By asking questions and then listening to people's answers,

00:25:53.619 --> 00:25:56.619
we may help some of them to accept the good news.

00:25:56.619 --> 00:26:03.619
And we will definitely experience firsthand the joy of disciple-making.

00:26:03.619 --> 00:26:07.619
Brother Patrick LaFranca, a helper to the Personnel Committee,

00:26:07.619 --> 00:26:10.619
will now present the next part of this symposium.

00:26:10.619 --> 00:26:13.619
Experience the joy of disciple-making, improve your skills,

00:26:13.619 --> 00:26:23.740
unleashing the power of God's Word.

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:28.740
As disciples-makers, we are somewhat like a carpenter who has a toolbox.

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:31.740
And inside he has hand tools and he has power tools.

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:36.740
He likes the power tools because they save him a lot of time and energy.

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:40.740
He has a power drill that can penetrate hard wood.

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:46.740
He has a power sander that can strip away layers of built-up grime.

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:51.740
He has a power nailer that can nail together pieces very quickly.

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:56.740
Well, likewise, we have a teaching toolbox.

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:59.740
And inside we have many useful tools.

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:06.740
But there's no question the most powerful tool we have is God's Word.

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:13.740
Notice how the Apostle Paul described God's Word in Hebrews chapter 4 and verse 12.

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:22.740
For the Word of God is alive and exerts power and is sharper than any two-edged sword

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:28.740
and pierces even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints from the marrow

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:33.740
and is able to discern thoughts and intentions of the heart.

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:38.740
So Paul says it's like a sword that can pierce right to the heart.

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:42.740
Now, is that important in our disciple-making work?

00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:46.740
Yes, because we cannot read hearts.

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:51.740
But when we use God's powerful Word, we begin to discern whether the person

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:57.740
is rightly disposed toward everlasting life and we can perhaps help that person.

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:06.740
Like using the carpenter-powered tools, why it can penetrate right to the heart of a person.

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:12.740
It can strip away what's on the surface and help the person realize what he really is.

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:16.740
It can really nail down the points.

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:20.740
The Apostle Paul realized God's Word was dynamic.

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:23.740
That's why it's described that way.

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:28.740
It's dynamic because it comes from the living God, Jehovah.

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:33.740
You see, these words are not just words on a page.

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:38.740
Jesus said, these are words from the mouth of Jehovah.

00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:41.740
A brother asked this question,

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:45.740
if you were preaching from house to house with Jehovah himself,

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:50.740
would you do all the speaking or would you allow him to talk?

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:56.740
Yes, when we open the Bible, we are allowing Jehovah to speak,

00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:59.740
and that is powerful.

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:03.740
The Apostle Paul went to the city of Thessalonica

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:08.740
and he found Gentiles worshipping lifeless idols.

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:09.740
But what happened?

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:12.740
First Thessalonians 1.9, Paul wrote,

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:16.740
these Gentiles had turned away from their lifeless idols

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:19.740
to serve the true and the living God.

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:21.740
How did that happen?

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:26.740
In chapter 2 verse 13, Paul noted they had received the Word of God

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:31.740
and that Word was at work in those believers.

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:34.740
Paul rejoiced with those results.

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:37.740
And we too, one of our greatest joys,

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:42.740
is to see how a new disciple allows God's Word to work in him

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:45.740
and he makes big changes.

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:47.740
And the following dramatization,

00:29:47.740 --> 00:30:12.950
notice how Nida unleashes the power of God's Word.

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:15.950
Yo, so tell me.

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:17.950
Hi, again.

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:20.950
You're really quite stealthy.

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:22.950
Brilliant, right?

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:24.950
Perfect, when I'm late for class,

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:27.950
which is always right.

00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:32.950
So, last week, you spoke about promises

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:35.950
and I'm not about church,

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:37.950
but I am about promises.

00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:38.950
So?

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:41.950
Okay, well, if these are God's promises,

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:43.950
wouldn't it make sense to go to His Word

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:45.950
to find out how to enjoy them?

00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:46.950
Seems right.

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:47.950
Okay.

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:50.950
This is John 173.

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:57.019
Would you like to read it?

00:30:57.019 --> 00:30:59.019
Out loud?

00:30:59.019 --> 00:31:00.019
Really?

00:31:00.019 --> 00:31:02.019
Then you know what it says?

00:31:02.019 --> 00:31:05.019
I do, but it's nice to hear it again.

00:31:05.019 --> 00:31:10.519
This means everlasting life.

00:31:10.519 --> 00:31:12.519
They're coming to know you,

00:31:12.519 --> 00:31:15.519
the only true God,

00:31:15.519 --> 00:31:18.519
and the one whom you sent of Jesus Christ.

00:31:18.519 --> 00:31:20.519
So, based on this,

00:31:20.519 --> 00:31:23.519
what means everlasting life?

00:31:23.519 --> 00:31:26.960
Getting to know God?

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.960
But how can you get to know something?

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.960
You're not even sure exists.

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:35.400
Would you like to explore that answer next time you come by?

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:38.400
Who said anything about it next time?

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.400
Oh, I just wanted you up.

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:42.400
See it out.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:53.539
Did you see how Nita unleashed the power of God's Word?

00:31:53.539 --> 00:31:55.539
She asked a simple question

00:31:55.539 --> 00:31:58.539
that led to reading John 173.

00:31:58.539 --> 00:32:02.539
And this is a simple but powerful scripture.

00:32:02.539 --> 00:32:06.539
Jesus was the most skillful disciple maker.

00:32:06.539 --> 00:32:10.539
He basis teaching completely on God's Word.

00:32:10.539 --> 00:32:12.539
And when it was possible,

00:32:12.539 --> 00:32:14.539
he actually read from the scriptures.

00:32:14.539 --> 00:32:19.539
For example, you may remember the account in Luke chapter 4.

00:32:19.539 --> 00:32:23.539
When Jesus went back to his hometown of Nazareth,

00:32:23.539 --> 00:32:25.539
he entered the synagogue,

00:32:25.539 --> 00:32:28.539
and he read from the scroll of Isaiah.

00:32:28.539 --> 00:32:31.539
This is the prophecy about the anointed one

00:32:31.539 --> 00:32:33.539
who would preach good news

00:32:33.539 --> 00:32:35.539
and God's acceptable year.

00:32:35.539 --> 00:32:39.539
But Jesus didn't stop at just reading the scripture.

00:32:40.539 --> 00:32:42.539
He explained its meaning.

00:32:42.539 --> 00:32:44.539
He said today,

00:32:44.539 --> 00:32:48.539
this scripture that you just heard is fulfilled.

00:32:48.539 --> 00:32:50.539
And those towns people could have understood that

00:32:50.539 --> 00:32:53.539
because he had left the town,

00:32:53.539 --> 00:32:56.539
left his carpentry work months earlier

00:32:56.539 --> 00:32:58.539
and had begun his ministry.

00:32:58.539 --> 00:33:03.539
Likewise, it's not enough for us just to read a scripture.

00:33:03.539 --> 00:33:06.539
We must explain its meaning.

00:33:06.539 --> 00:33:08.539
And Nita did that.

00:33:08.539 --> 00:33:11.539
You remember after John 17 III was read,

00:33:11.539 --> 00:33:13.539
she asked this question.

00:33:13.539 --> 00:33:15.539
So based on this,

00:33:15.539 --> 00:33:18.539
what means everlasting life?

00:33:18.539 --> 00:33:20.539
And the girl got it.

00:33:20.539 --> 00:33:23.539
It means getting to know God.

00:33:23.539 --> 00:33:25.539
What can we do, though,

00:33:25.539 --> 00:33:28.539
if our listener doesn't get it?

00:33:28.539 --> 00:33:34.539
Well, we can just reread the keywords in that verse.

00:33:34.539 --> 00:33:37.539
Also, friends, we must be careful

00:33:37.539 --> 00:33:39.539
not to assume that people understand

00:33:39.539 --> 00:33:41.539
the terms we commonly use.

00:33:41.539 --> 00:33:45.539
For example, we often talk about the kingdom.

00:33:45.539 --> 00:33:47.539
Well, to our listener,

00:33:47.539 --> 00:33:49.539
they may be thinking of heaven.

00:33:49.539 --> 00:33:52.539
They may be thinking it's a condition of one's heart.

00:33:52.539 --> 00:33:54.539
Not a government.

00:33:54.539 --> 00:33:56.539
So we have to explain.

00:33:56.539 --> 00:34:01.539
Also, be patient as we use God's word.

00:34:01.539 --> 00:34:05.539
Faith in God and appreciation for the scriptures

00:34:05.539 --> 00:34:08.539
take time to grow.

00:34:08.539 --> 00:34:13.539
And Jesus illustrated this in Mark chapter 4 verse 26.

00:34:13.539 --> 00:34:17.110
Let's just read that.

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:18.110
So he went on to say,

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:19.110
in this way,

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:25.110
the kingdom of God is just as when a man casts seeds on the ground.

00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:26.110
Yes, like a farmer,

00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:28.110
when we spread the kingdom message,

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:30.110
we're casting seeds.

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:35.110
But do we expect those seeds to sprout overnight?

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:40.110
Jesus explains the growth process in verse 28.

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:45.110
On his own, the ground bears fruit gradually.

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:48.110
First the stalk, then the head,

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:51.110
finally the full grain in the head.

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:54.110
So it's a gradual process.

00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:56.110
The farmer waters and nurtures the seed,

00:34:56.110 --> 00:34:59.110
but he must wait.

00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:03.110
Likewise, we need to be patient disciple makers.

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:09.110
It may take many return visits before we actually start a Bible study.

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:11.110
But on each return visit,

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:17.110
let's try to help the person to progressively build faith in God's word.

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:22.110
Here's an example of how we could help a person come to appreciate

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:27.110
that the Bible has practical, up to date advice.

00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:29.110
Once sister does this,

00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:30.110
she asks,

00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:34.110
what would you say is the key to getting along with people?

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:38.110
May I read a proverb from the Bible?

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:41.110
And she reads Proverbs 17-14,

00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:43.110
which says,

00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:46.110
beginning a fight is like opening a floodgate

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:49.110
before the quarrel breaks out, take your leave.

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:51.110
And then she asks,

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:54.110
do you think that this advice could help us to get along with others?

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:58.110
A reasonable person would say yes.

00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:01.110
How can we help a person build faith

00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:05.110
that the Bible was a book of reliable prophecy?

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:07.110
Well, on one return visit,

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:12.110
we could briefly discuss the prophecy in Isaiah 13-20.

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:15.110
This says that the city of Babylon

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:18.110
would never again be inhabited.

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:23.110
Well, 50 miles south of Baghdad, Iraq,

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:25.110
are the runes of Babylon.

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:30.110
No one lives there and no one has for centuries.

00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:32.110
How can we help someone build faith

00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:35.110
that there exists a creator?

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:39.110
Simply read Hebrews 3-4.

00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:42.110
Every house is constructed by someone,

00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:46.110
but the one who constructed all things is God.

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:48.110
And then we could ask,

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:53.110
is someone told you that the house you live in constructed itself?

00:36:53.110 --> 00:36:54.110
Would you believe them?

00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:56.110
Obviously not.

00:36:56.110 --> 00:36:58.110
Neither could we really believe

00:36:58.110 --> 00:37:02.110
that this whole universe constructed itself.

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:04.110
So brothers and sisters,

00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:07.110
this is a powerful tool.

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:10.110
Let's unleash its power in our ministry.

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:14.110
We will become more effective disciple makers

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:17.110
and we will overflow with joy

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:22.110
as we see that word of God at work in a new believer.

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:25.110
Brother David's plane, a member of the governing body,

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:28.110
will now present the next part of this symposium

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:31.110
experience the joy of disciple making,

00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:35.110
improve your skills, illustrating key points.

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:44.340
Do you find it easy to think

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:47.340
of effective illustrations for the ministry?

00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:49.340
I sure don't,

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:52.340
but some have a real gift for it.

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:54.340
I have a friend like that.

00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:57.340
He can look at almost any situation

00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:59.340
and think of an illustration.

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:03.340
One day, we were traveling along a mountain road.

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:05.340
I was driving.

00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:07.340
My car wasn't very good.

00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:09.340
It was the best I could afford at the time.

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:13.340
And suddenly, a red warning light came on.

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:15.340
Quick as a flash, my friend said,

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:18.340
I just thought of a great illustration.

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:20.340
The conscience is like a warning light.

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:24.340
His first thought, an illustration.

00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:26.340
His second thought,

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:28.340
oh, we're in trouble.

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:31.340
Illustrations come naturally to him.

00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:33.340
It's just like breathing to him.

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:35.340
Some have the gift,

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:38.340
and the rest of us have to work at it.

00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:40.340
But why should we work at it?

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:43.340
Why should we learn to use illustrations?

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:45.340
Well, for one thing,

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:47.340
because Jesus used them,

00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:49.340
and he was the greatest teacher of them all.

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:52.340
Jesus used illustrations all along,

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:58.340
as we find when we read Matthew chapter 13 and verse 34.

00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:00.340
I'll give you a moment.

00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:02.340
Let's read this together.

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:07.659
Matthew chapter 13 and verse 34.

00:39:07.659 --> 00:39:12.659
All these things, Jesus spoke to the crowds by illustrations.

00:39:12.659 --> 00:39:15.659
Indeed, without an illustration,

00:39:15.659 --> 00:39:18.659
He would not speak to them.

00:39:18.659 --> 00:39:20.659
Jesus knew

00:39:20.659 --> 00:39:23.659
that an illustration is often the most effective way

00:39:23.659 --> 00:39:24.659
to touch the heart.

00:39:24.659 --> 00:39:26.659
And that's especially true

00:39:26.659 --> 00:39:29.659
if people are featured in the illustration.

00:39:29.659 --> 00:39:31.659
Now, suppose I say,

00:39:31.659 --> 00:39:32.659
if you're going along the road

00:39:32.659 --> 00:39:34.659
and you see someone in trouble,

00:39:34.659 --> 00:39:36.659
stop and help them,

00:39:36.659 --> 00:39:38.659
even if he's of a different race.

00:39:38.659 --> 00:39:39.659
That's clear.

00:39:39.659 --> 00:39:41.659
It makes the point.

00:39:41.659 --> 00:39:44.659
Jesus' illustration about the neighborly Samaritan

00:39:44.659 --> 00:39:46.659
makes the same point,

00:39:46.659 --> 00:39:48.659
but it's so much more effective.

00:39:48.659 --> 00:39:50.659
It stirs the emotions.

00:39:50.659 --> 00:39:52.659
It engages the mind.

00:39:52.659 --> 00:39:54.659
We feel pity for the poor Jew

00:39:54.659 --> 00:39:56.659
who fell among thieves.

00:39:56.659 --> 00:39:58.659
We feel love for the Samaritan

00:39:58.659 --> 00:40:00.659
who stopped to help him

00:40:00.659 --> 00:40:02.659
and discussed for the priest

00:40:02.659 --> 00:40:05.659
and Levite who didn't stop.

00:40:05.659 --> 00:40:08.659
We're determined not to be like them.

00:40:08.659 --> 00:40:12.659
An illustration can put a human face on a problem

00:40:12.659 --> 00:40:17.659
and reinforce our determination to apply the lesson.

00:40:17.659 --> 00:40:20.659
A good illustration can help a Bible student

00:40:20.659 --> 00:40:22.659
grasp a point he's been struggling with.

00:40:22.659 --> 00:40:24.659
Let's see how that works.

00:40:24.659 --> 00:40:25.659
In a conversation,

00:40:25.659 --> 00:40:27.659
Nita is having with Jade

00:40:27.659 --> 00:40:29.659
in a coffee shop.

00:40:29.659 --> 00:40:52.329
Let's do this.

00:40:52.329 --> 00:40:54.329
A bit of a neat freak.

00:40:54.329 --> 00:40:55.329
You don't say?

00:40:55.329 --> 00:40:57.329
So, last time we discussed

00:40:57.329 --> 00:40:59.329
how God created us to live forever,

00:40:59.329 --> 00:41:01.329
which raises the question,

00:41:01.329 --> 00:41:02.329
why do we die?

00:41:02.329 --> 00:41:03.329
Totally.

00:41:03.329 --> 00:41:05.329
Totally what?

00:41:05.329 --> 00:41:07.329
No, like I mean, I totally agree.

00:41:07.329 --> 00:41:09.329
That's what we talked about.

00:41:09.329 --> 00:41:11.329
Right.

00:41:11.329 --> 00:41:14.329
Let's open to Romans 5, verse 12.

00:41:14.329 --> 00:41:16.329
Wait, why don't I read it out loud

00:41:16.329 --> 00:41:21.250
so we can both enjoy it?

00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:24.659
That is why,

00:41:24.659 --> 00:41:26.659
just as through one man,

00:41:26.659 --> 00:41:28.659
sin entered into the world

00:41:28.659 --> 00:41:30.659
and death through sin.

00:41:30.659 --> 00:41:33.659
And so death spread to all men

00:41:33.659 --> 00:41:36.659
because they had all sinned.

00:41:36.659 --> 00:41:37.659
Okay, hold it.

00:41:37.659 --> 00:41:39.659
Is Adam the one man?

00:41:39.659 --> 00:41:41.659
Exactly.

00:41:41.659 --> 00:41:43.659
This doesn't make sense.

00:41:43.659 --> 00:41:46.659
You said Adam was perfect and wouldn't die.

00:41:46.659 --> 00:41:47.659
That's right.

00:41:47.659 --> 00:41:49.659
But then he sins

00:41:49.659 --> 00:41:51.659
and loses that.

00:41:51.659 --> 00:41:53.659
So what's that got to do with me?

00:41:53.659 --> 00:41:55.659
I die because he's stupid.

00:41:55.659 --> 00:42:01.860
Well, maybe not how I would have put it.

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:03.860
Maybe we can think of it this way.

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:06.860
When parents with a severe genetic defect

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:08.860
have children,

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:09.860
what happens?

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:11.860
Usually the kids inherit it.

00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:12.860
Precisely.

00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:14.860
When Adam sinned,

00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:16.860
that sin became like a genetic defect

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:20.860
that caused sickness, aging, and death.

00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:23.860
And since we're all his children.

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:27.780
Oh.

00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:29.780
Brilliant.

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:31.780
I get it.

00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:32.780
Why don't we watch a little video

00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:34.780
that helps put it all together?

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:50.199
Why was Need's illustration effective?

00:42:51.199 --> 00:42:53.199
Jade was struggling to understand

00:42:53.199 --> 00:42:56.199
how she could inherit imperfection from Adam,

00:42:56.199 --> 00:42:58.199
a man who lived long ago.

00:42:58.199 --> 00:43:00.199
And she wasn't going to get past it.

00:43:00.199 --> 00:43:04.199
So that was the point Neeta chose to illustrate.

00:43:04.199 --> 00:43:06.199
So when you're studying with someone,

00:43:06.199 --> 00:43:09.199
choose carefully what you'll illustrate.

00:43:09.199 --> 00:43:11.199
Let it be a main point in the lesson,

00:43:11.199 --> 00:43:14.199
or an idea that your student is having trouble with.

00:43:14.199 --> 00:43:17.199
There has to be a good reason

00:43:17.199 --> 00:43:19.199
for using an illustration.

00:43:19.199 --> 00:43:23.639
Our illustrations should be appealing.

00:43:23.639 --> 00:43:26.639
What do we mean by that?

00:43:26.639 --> 00:43:28.639
An illustration will appeal to the student

00:43:28.639 --> 00:43:31.639
if it's about something familiar.

00:43:31.639 --> 00:43:33.639
Now again, Jesus' parable of the Samaritan

00:43:33.639 --> 00:43:35.639
comes to mind.

00:43:35.639 --> 00:43:38.639
The setting of the illustration was nearby,

00:43:38.639 --> 00:43:41.639
a familiar road between Jerusalem and Jericho.

00:43:41.639 --> 00:43:43.639
Not the hanging gardens of Babylon

00:43:43.639 --> 00:43:45.639
or the pyramids of Egypt.

00:43:45.639 --> 00:43:47.639
And it was realistic.

00:43:47.639 --> 00:43:49.639
There were many robberies along that road.

00:43:50.639 --> 00:43:52.639
And the attitude of the priest

00:43:52.639 --> 00:43:55.639
and Levite toward that poor, injured Jew

00:43:55.639 --> 00:43:58.639
totally believable.

00:43:58.639 --> 00:44:01.639
Neeta also chose wisely.

00:44:01.639 --> 00:44:04.639
Her illustration was about inheriting a birth defect,

00:44:04.639 --> 00:44:09.639
something she knew Jade would understand.

00:44:09.639 --> 00:44:12.639
Now you may have a couple of go-to illustrations

00:44:12.639 --> 00:44:15.639
that you've used for years and years.

00:44:15.639 --> 00:44:17.639
And years?

00:44:17.639 --> 00:44:20.639
Why not look for fresh ones that make the same points?

00:44:20.639 --> 00:44:23.639
Put a little sparkle back on your ministry.

00:44:23.639 --> 00:44:27.920
Let's consider two ways of doing that.

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:30.920
First, be observant.

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:33.920
Matthew 6.26, Jesus says,

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:37.920
observe intently the birds of the heavens.

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:40.920
Jesus was aware of his surroundings

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:42.920
and he thought about what he saw.

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:44.920
He observed the housewife,

00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:46.920
children playing in the village square,

00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:48.920
the farmer,

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:50.920
the rich man with his treasures.

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:52.920
So learn from Jesus,

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:55.920
slow down and smell the flowers.

00:44:55.920 --> 00:45:00.920
Then think of an illustration about flowers.

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:03.920
But what if you feel you don't have a creative bone in your body

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:06.920
and yet you still need fresh illustrations?

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:08.920
Our second resource,

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:10.920
our publications,

00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:12.920
turn to the Watchtower Publications Index

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:14.920
under illustrations

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:16.920
and you'll find abundance

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:20.920
of beautiful illustrations that have been used in our publications.

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:23.920
And as you're studying our later publications,

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:27.920
take note of the illustrations that are used.

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:30.920
Choose simple illustrations.

00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:33.920
Use little things to explain big things

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:38.920
and simple things to explain complicated things.

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:41.920
A sister at a congregation meeting

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:44.920
used a very simple but effective illustration

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:47.920
regarding Jehovah and the ransom.

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:48.920
She said,

00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:49.920
when you're shopping,

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:53.920
you never pay full price for damaged goods.

00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:55.920
Her point?

00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:57.920
We're all damaged goods.

00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:00.920
Yet Jehovah paid full price for us

00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:02.920
with the life of his son.

00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:04.920
The illustration was simple.

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:08.920
It was appealing because it was about something familiar,

00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:09.920
shopping.

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:12.920
It was also appropriate to the audience,

00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:15.920
there were a lot of batholites in the audience,

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:18.920
and you know batholites never pay full price for anything.

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:21.920
When you're illustrating a point,

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:24.920
avoid distracting the student with minor details.

00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:25.920
Minor details,

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:26.920
if they don't fit,

00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:28.920
they can get you into a lot of trouble.

00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:31.920
If they don't work with the main point of the illustration,

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:34.920
the student may focus on the inconsistencies

00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:37.920
and miss the point altogether.

00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:40.920
Well, in summary, what do we say?

00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:43.920
It takes time to develop good illustrations,

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:45.920
but it's worth the effort.

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:47.920
If you have the gift, use it,

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:49.920
and share it with others.

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:51.920
But if like me, you don't have the gift,

00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:53.920
work at it.

00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:55.920
You'll be glad you did.

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:59.920
And so will your Bible students.

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:01.920
Now, brother Kenneth Flodin,

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:03.920
a helper to the teaching committee,

00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:05.920
will present the next part of the symposium.

00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:08.920
Experience the joy of disciplemaking,

00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:10.920
improve your skills,

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:13.920
teaching with enthusiasm.

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:23.630
Try, if you will,

00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:28.630
to imagine a virus that becomes a global pandemic.

00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:31.630
The daily news is ominous.

00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:35.630
Fear and panic hold full sway.

00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:38.630
Well, that's not too difficult to imagine, isn't it?

00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:42.630
But what if they found a cure?

00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:46.630
Well, now instantly, the newscaster's tone would change.

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:48.630
He would be enthusiastic.

00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:50.630
And why is that?

00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:52.630
Because he has good news to share

00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:55.630
to the world's population.

00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:57.630
Well, how about us?

00:47:57.630 --> 00:48:00.630
Please find Isaiah 52-7.

00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:06.360
Isaiah 52-7, why should we be enthusiastic

00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:09.360
when we teach those who have been exposed

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:13.360
to the evil viruses of Satan's old world?

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:16.360
Well, it's because we have the best news ever

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:18.360
to share with the world's population.

00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:22.360
Notice how this is brought out Isaiah 52-7.

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:25.610
It says, how beautiful on the mountains

00:48:25.610 --> 00:48:29.610
are the feet of the one bringing good news,

00:48:29.610 --> 00:48:32.610
the one proclaiming peace,

00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:35.610
the one bringing good news of something better,

00:48:35.610 --> 00:48:38.610
the one proclaiming salvation,

00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:40.610
the one saying in Zion,

00:48:40.610 --> 00:48:43.610
your God has become king.

00:48:43.610 --> 00:48:46.610
Yes, we have good news that's better

00:48:46.610 --> 00:48:50.610
than conquering one perturbing virus.

00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:52.610
Now, in the videos of this symposium,

00:48:52.610 --> 00:48:55.610
you probably noticed that initially,

00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:58.610
Nida was enthused,

00:48:58.610 --> 00:49:02.610
and a regular Bible study has been established with Jade.

00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:05.610
But it's our continued enthusiasm

00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:08.610
that can help keep a student interested

00:49:08.610 --> 00:49:11.610
and motivate them to act.

00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:14.610
Now, in the following dramatization,

00:49:14.610 --> 00:49:18.610
you will note that Nida learns the importance

00:49:18.610 --> 00:49:21.610
of maintaining enthusiasm.

00:49:22.610 --> 00:49:43.550
Knee to your fullest.

00:49:43.550 --> 00:49:50.579
It's Jade again.

00:49:50.579 --> 00:49:53.579
We've only studied once this month.

00:49:53.579 --> 00:49:55.579
She's so unscheduled.

00:49:55.579 --> 00:49:58.579
I thought you said she was doing well.

00:49:58.579 --> 00:49:59.579
She was.

00:49:59.579 --> 00:50:02.579
Now it's just, see you later.

00:50:02.579 --> 00:50:05.889
How was your last study?

00:50:05.889 --> 00:50:09.619
That's a very interesting question,

00:50:09.619 --> 00:50:13.619
but it's not really what we're talking about in this paragraph, is it?

00:50:13.619 --> 00:50:17.619
So, let's just read the scripture, shall we?

00:50:17.619 --> 00:50:29.789
In my defense, I was annoyed.

00:50:29.789 --> 00:50:32.789
She never even attempts to explain why she can't solve.

00:50:32.789 --> 00:50:34.789
I understand.

00:50:34.789 --> 00:50:36.789
Really, I do.

00:50:36.789 --> 00:50:40.789
But if she's still open to studying,

00:50:41.789 --> 00:50:44.789
you can't let these little things drain your enthusiasm.

00:50:44.789 --> 00:50:46.789
I know.

00:50:46.789 --> 00:50:48.789
I just...

00:50:48.789 --> 00:50:50.789
I wish she was more structured.

00:50:50.789 --> 00:50:53.789
It's like she doesn't take anything seriously.

00:50:53.789 --> 00:50:55.789
No studies perfect.

00:50:55.789 --> 00:50:57.789
She's making some effort.

00:50:57.789 --> 00:50:59.789
Focus on that.

00:50:59.789 --> 00:51:16.940
If anyone's enthusiasm is contagious, it's yours.

00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:18.940
I haven't mentioned it already.

00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:20.940
I really love our chats.

00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:22.940
And I appreciate all your questions.

00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:24.940
Thanks.

00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:26.940
I know sometimes they're crazy.

00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:29.940
No, you're a deep thinker.

00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:36.880
It's good for both of us.

00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:38.880
Okay.

00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:51.099
Yeah, we're cool.

00:51:51.099 --> 00:51:55.099
Do you remember when Nita first met Jade?

00:51:55.099 --> 00:51:59.099
Jade said, like, I'm jaded.

00:51:59.099 --> 00:52:05.099
The English word jaded means made dull, apathetic or cynical.

00:52:05.099 --> 00:52:10.099
And we just noticed that Nita was annoyed with Jade.

00:52:10.099 --> 00:52:16.099
She became dull, apathetic, unenthusiastic because of Jade's attitude.

00:52:16.099 --> 00:52:20.099
But that affected Nita's enthusiasm.

00:52:20.099 --> 00:52:26.099
And it had a circular effect, likely contributing to Jade's seeming lack of interest.

00:52:26.099 --> 00:52:31.099
Well, how do we develop enthusiasm?

00:52:31.099 --> 00:52:39.099
You likely noticed that Nita and Jade, they speak the same language, well, almost.

00:52:39.099 --> 00:52:42.099
But there are two totally different personalities.

00:52:42.099 --> 00:52:46.099
We could be teaching someone of a totally different cultural background.

00:52:46.099 --> 00:52:52.099
But the good news is, enthusiasm crosses all boundaries.

00:52:52.099 --> 00:52:56.099
Please find with me Romans 12-11.

00:52:56.099 --> 00:52:58.099
Romans 12.

00:52:58.099 --> 00:53:05.099
And it's good to remember that enthusiasm is not just some giddy outward show of excitement.

00:53:05.099 --> 00:53:08.099
It actually happens from within us.

00:53:08.099 --> 00:53:10.099
Romans 12-11.

00:53:10.099 --> 00:53:13.099
Be industrious, not lazy.

00:53:13.099 --> 00:53:16.099
Be a glow with the spirit.

00:53:16.099 --> 00:53:18.099
Slave for Jehovah.

00:53:18.099 --> 00:53:23.099
We want to highlight that matter of being a glow with the spirit.

00:53:23.099 --> 00:53:28.099
The word translated a glow literally means boiling.

00:53:28.099 --> 00:53:34.099
So to maintain enthusiasm, we need a constant flow of God's Holy Spirit.

00:53:34.099 --> 00:53:39.099
That's like the heat source that keeps us boiling.

00:53:39.099 --> 00:53:42.099
So how do we prepare to teach a Bible student?

00:53:42.099 --> 00:53:48.099
Well, we might think, well, I like to go over the lesson in advance.

00:53:48.099 --> 00:53:52.099
And I remind myself of what the cited scriptures say.

00:53:52.099 --> 00:53:55.099
And that's good. That's necessary.

00:53:55.099 --> 00:53:58.099
But that all is just happening in our head.

00:53:58.099 --> 00:54:02.099
How do we get the water boiling inside?

00:54:02.099 --> 00:54:06.099
Do you remember the suggestion in Ezra 7-10?

00:54:06.099 --> 00:54:11.099
Ezra there said that he prepared his heart to teach.

00:54:11.099 --> 00:54:16.099
Well, if that thought in mind, please find Psalm 45-1.

00:54:16.099 --> 00:54:18.099
We need to click the download button.

00:54:19.099 --> 00:54:22.099
We need to download from our head to our heart.

00:54:22.099 --> 00:54:24.099
Notice how the heart's involved here.

00:54:24.099 --> 00:54:27.099
Psalm 45-1 says,

00:54:27.099 --> 00:54:30.099
My heart, it does not say my head.

00:54:30.099 --> 00:54:34.099
My heart is stirred by something good.

00:54:34.099 --> 00:54:37.099
I say, my song is about a king.

00:54:37.099 --> 00:54:42.099
May my tongue be the stylus of a skilled copyist.

00:54:42.099 --> 00:54:45.099
It said, my heart is stirred.

00:54:45.099 --> 00:54:51.099
Interestingly, the word translated stirred also means to boil or bubble up.

00:54:51.099 --> 00:54:56.099
And what's the result if we get that action going inside of us?

00:54:56.099 --> 00:55:02.099
The end of the verse said that my tongue, in other words, my speech will be skilled.

00:55:02.099 --> 00:55:09.099
Yes, we improve our skills as a disciple maker when we maintain enthusiasm.

00:55:09.099 --> 00:55:14.099
And we get our enthusiasm bubbling, boiling, stirred up.

00:55:14.099 --> 00:55:20.099
When we meditate on the importance of the lesson we're about to teach.

00:55:20.099 --> 00:55:24.099
And my wife likes to watch cooking shows on television.

00:55:24.099 --> 00:55:29.099
And I've noticed that invariably there's always an electric blender.

00:55:29.099 --> 00:55:35.099
And I do realize that in some of your cultures, you might prefer mortar and pestle,

00:55:35.099 --> 00:55:38.099
a sharp knife to cut things up and mix them together.

00:55:38.099 --> 00:55:41.099
But we have all those ingredients laid out on the counter before us,

00:55:41.099 --> 00:55:46.099
maybe vegetables, herbs, spices, all we salt and pepper.

00:55:46.099 --> 00:55:48.099
What is that like?

00:55:48.099 --> 00:55:51.099
That's like having the ingredients in our mind.

00:55:51.099 --> 00:55:54.099
We've gone over the lesson in advance.

00:55:54.099 --> 00:55:56.099
We have the scriptures. We know what they say.

00:55:56.099 --> 00:56:02.099
But we really don't get enthused about that tasty dish until what happens.

00:56:02.099 --> 00:56:05.099
We mix all those ingredients in the blender.

00:56:05.099 --> 00:56:08.099
We bring it up to temperature, maybe even a boil.

00:56:08.099 --> 00:56:15.099
And then after the dish is done and we taste it, it tastes so good.

00:56:15.099 --> 00:56:17.099
We get enthusiastic.

00:56:17.099 --> 00:56:19.099
We tell others about this great recipe.

00:56:19.099 --> 00:56:21.099
Now they're interested.

00:56:21.099 --> 00:56:25.099
And they want to taste this culinary sensation as well.

00:56:25.099 --> 00:56:28.099
So how do we become enthusiastic?

00:56:28.099 --> 00:56:30.099
Meditate.

00:56:30.099 --> 00:56:32.099
Meditation is the blender.

00:56:32.099 --> 00:56:34.099
We take all the ingredients in our mind.

00:56:34.099 --> 00:56:40.099
We mix them together into a message that we're now enthused to share with others.

00:56:40.099 --> 00:56:45.099
And meditation includes asking ourselves questions to prepare the heart.

00:56:45.099 --> 00:56:48.099
For example, before your study, you might ask,

00:56:48.099 --> 00:56:52.099
how has this information benefited me personally?

00:56:52.099 --> 00:56:55.099
And Neeta needed to ask herself,

00:56:55.099 --> 00:56:58.099
why does Jade need to hear this?

00:56:58.099 --> 00:57:01.099
Maybe it's the perfect point at the right time for our student.

00:57:01.099 --> 00:57:03.099
And so we should ask,

00:57:03.099 --> 00:57:08.099
how will what I'm going to study benefit my student?

00:57:08.099 --> 00:57:11.099
Meditation stirs the heart.

00:57:11.099 --> 00:57:14.099
Please find with me first lesson on Chapter 1.

00:57:14.099 --> 00:57:23.300
Enthusiasm or zeal should not be confused with being overly emotional.

00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:29.300
That'd be like throwing too much hot pepper into the blender over emotional.

00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:33.300
And our heartfelt conviction should not cross the line

00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:38.300
and become dogmatic as to what our student must believe.

00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:44.300
See if you get the sense of this recipe in First Estelonians 1.5.

00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:49.300
It says, because the good news we preach did not come to you with speech alone.

00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:52.300
In other words, not just words out of the head,

00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:53.300
but notice the ingredients.

00:57:53.300 --> 00:58:00.300
It says also with power and with Holy Spirit and with strong conviction.

00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:04.300
When we've meditated on the material and we deliver it from the heart,

00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:08.300
it's reflected in our gestures, our facial expressions.

00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:11.300
We come across as natural, sincere,

00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:16.300
but you see animated with proper enthusiasm.

00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:20.300
If you're enthusiastic about Bible truths, it is contagious,

00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:23.300
but in a very good way.

00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:28.300
Your Bible student will not become jaded, dull, apathetic.

00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:35.300
Instead, your student will be enthusiastic, just like you, his teacher.

00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:39.300
And now we have the proofies of having brother Seth Hyatt.

00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:44.300
He's a helper for the service committee to present the next part on our symposium,

00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:50.300
experience the joy of disciple making, improve your skills, showing empathy.

00:58:50.300 --> 00:59:04.019
Empathy is a quality that is essential for effective disciple making.

00:59:04.019 --> 00:59:11.019
Interestingly, the word empathy doesn't occur in the main text of the New World translation,

00:59:11.019 --> 00:59:18.019
but the idea is clearly conveyed in expressions like fellow feeling.

00:59:18.019 --> 00:59:27.019
Jehovah and Jesus Christ are beautiful examples of ones who display empathy in their dealings with authors.

00:59:27.019 --> 00:59:31.019
For example, Jehovah said to his people,

00:59:31.019 --> 00:59:38.019
whoever touches you touches the pupil of my eye, empathy.

00:59:38.019 --> 00:59:44.019
And when Jesus was approached by a leper, begging to be healed,

00:59:44.019 --> 00:59:47.019
what was Jesus' response?

00:59:47.019 --> 00:59:53.019
The account tells us he reached out his hand, touched the man and said,

00:59:53.019 --> 00:59:57.019
I want to, empathy.

00:59:57.019 --> 01:00:08.019
Empathy is the ability to understand another person's thinking, feelings, concerns, anxieties.

01:00:08.019 --> 01:00:14.019
It may not come naturally, but it can be cultivated.

01:00:14.019 --> 01:00:20.019
The scriptures provide us with examples of individuals who were empathetic.

01:00:20.019 --> 01:00:28.019
For example, the Apostle Paul, who was a very effective disciple maker, was also empathetic.

01:00:28.019 --> 01:00:35.019
Turn in your Bible, please, to 1 Thessalonians, chapter 2, and let's read verses 7 and 8.

01:00:35.019 --> 01:00:47.059
On the contrary, we became gentle in your midst.

01:00:47.059 --> 01:00:53.059
As when a nursing mother tenderly cares for her own children.

01:00:53.059 --> 01:01:02.059
So having tender affection for you, we were determined to impart to you not only the good news of God,

01:01:02.059 --> 01:01:09.059
but also our very selves, because you became so beloved to us.

01:01:09.059 --> 01:01:14.469
How did Paul approach his ministry?

01:01:14.469 --> 01:01:17.469
Well, he says he was gentle.

01:01:17.469 --> 01:01:21.469
He displayed tender affection.

01:01:21.469 --> 01:01:29.469
And those who responded to the good news became beloved to him.

01:01:29.469 --> 01:01:37.469
Paul uses a very powerful illustration, that of a mother caring for her children.

01:01:38.469 --> 01:01:45.469
In the human context, there is probably no more powerful example of empathy than that of a mother.

01:01:45.469 --> 01:01:49.469
She feels her child's pain.

01:01:49.469 --> 01:01:53.469
When her child rejoices, she rejoices.

01:01:53.469 --> 01:01:57.469
When her child weeps, she weeps.

01:01:57.469 --> 01:02:00.820
Empathy.

01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:07.820
And did you notice, Paul said he was determined to impart not only the good news of God,

01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:12.190
but his own soul.

01:02:12.190 --> 01:02:16.190
Isn't it true as we help individuals today?

01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:22.190
It's not a matter of only imparting the facts of the truth.

01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:26.190
Bible students need help in many ways.

01:02:26.190 --> 01:02:36.190
And like the Apostle Paul, we're self-sacrificing, willing to put the interests of others ahead of our own interests.

01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:39.190
We're empathetic.

01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:59.329
In the following dramatization, take note of how Nina provides practical assistance to her Bible student.

01:02:59.329 --> 01:03:05.090
It's fine. This is mine. My treat.

01:03:05.090 --> 01:03:08.090
Brilliant. Thanks. I didn't have any breakfast.

01:03:08.090 --> 01:03:13.090
So, we left off at paragraph 10.

01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:18.090
Listen, I don't have it in me today. I got like two hours sleep.

01:03:18.090 --> 01:03:22.969
You are right.

01:03:22.969 --> 01:03:27.969
Just super stressed. I can't focus.

01:03:27.969 --> 01:03:29.969
I'm really sorry.

01:03:29.969 --> 01:03:37.440
My boyfriend, school, work, everything else.

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:40.440
I just don't even have time to breathe.

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:46.440
When my schedule gets a bit crazy, I focus on organizing what I can.

01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:50.260
How's that?

01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:53.260
I give everything a proper place.

01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:55.260
Yeah, I'm not really the organization type.

01:03:55.260 --> 01:04:01.260
But I can help. I mean, if you want.

01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:03.260
I guess a little help couldn't hurt.

01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:07.260
So, how organized is your place right now?

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:19.869
K. Well, where should we start?

01:04:19.869 --> 01:04:22.869
You're the neat freak. You tell me.

01:04:22.869 --> 01:04:25.869
Let's try and find the bed. We'll work from there.

01:04:25.869 --> 01:04:45.429
Did you notice how did Nina display empathy?

01:04:45.429 --> 01:04:48.429
Well, she was observant.

01:04:48.429 --> 01:04:50.429
She was a good listener.

01:04:50.429 --> 01:04:54.429
And she offered practical assistance, didn't she?

01:04:54.429 --> 01:04:58.429
She had some food for her Bible student.

01:04:58.429 --> 01:05:04.429
And at the end of the dramatization, she was helping in other practical ways.

01:05:04.429 --> 01:05:10.429
And I think we would all agree she showed fellow feeling for her Bible student.

01:05:10.429 --> 01:05:13.429
You and I have to do these things as well.

01:05:13.429 --> 01:05:18.429
Be observant. What do you know about your Bible student?

01:05:18.429 --> 01:05:22.429
What are the student's circumstances in life?

01:05:22.429 --> 01:05:25.429
What is the student's family situation?

01:05:25.429 --> 01:05:28.429
Does the student have hobbies?

01:05:28.429 --> 01:05:30.429
Entrists?

01:05:30.429 --> 01:05:33.429
What is the religious background?

01:05:33.429 --> 01:05:36.429
What does your student believe?

01:05:36.429 --> 01:05:41.429
Well, be observant and ask good questions.

01:05:41.429 --> 01:05:47.429
And when you ask a question, give your student time to answer.

01:05:47.429 --> 01:05:52.429
What is our inclination when we ask our student a question,

01:05:52.429 --> 01:05:55.429
and the answer doesn't come quickly?

01:05:55.429 --> 01:06:00.429
We tend to jump in to save our student,

01:06:00.429 --> 01:06:03.429
but that approach isn't really helpful.

01:06:03.429 --> 01:06:07.429
When you ask a question, be patient.

01:06:07.429 --> 01:06:12.429
Allow the student time to think and to respond.

01:06:12.429 --> 01:06:15.429
And when the student responds, be positive.

01:06:15.429 --> 01:06:19.429
Commend the student for being honest, forthright,

01:06:19.429 --> 01:06:24.429
even if the answer is not exactly what you were hoping for.

01:06:24.429 --> 01:06:28.429
And keep in mind, as we observe and listen,

01:06:28.429 --> 01:06:32.429
and ask questions and display personal interest,

01:06:32.429 --> 01:06:37.429
we're very careful not to pry into matters that are really not our business.

01:06:37.429 --> 01:06:41.429
And we don't want to show inappropriate interest

01:06:41.429 --> 01:06:45.429
by becoming overly familiar with a Bible student.

01:06:45.429 --> 01:06:52.349
Does your Bible student need practical assistance?

01:06:52.349 --> 01:06:56.349
Well, as we listen and observe,

01:06:56.349 --> 01:06:59.349
we're in a position to share information

01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:03.349
that will be truly helpful to the student.

01:07:03.349 --> 01:07:06.349
Avoid the tendency, the temptation,

01:07:06.349 --> 01:07:09.349
to give superficial advice.

01:07:09.349 --> 01:07:14.349
It's much better to meditate, do research,

01:07:14.349 --> 01:07:19.349
and then you can give the student tailored Bible-based advice

01:07:19.349 --> 01:07:22.349
taken from Bible-based publications

01:07:22.349 --> 01:07:26.349
that specifically address the student's needs.

01:07:26.349 --> 01:07:29.349
And that is beautiful.

01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:34.349
Be prepared too to explain how to apply the counsel.

01:07:34.349 --> 01:07:37.349
People's lives are so complicated.

01:07:37.349 --> 01:07:41.349
They face so many challenges they may not know.

01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:47.349
So explain, but don't pressure.

01:07:47.349 --> 01:07:52.349
The best change always comes from the inside out.

01:07:52.349 --> 01:07:57.349
In other words, the Bible student's heart should motivate him

01:07:57.349 --> 01:08:02.789
or to make necessary adjustments in life.

01:08:02.789 --> 01:08:08.789
Does your student need transportation to the Kingdom Hall?

01:08:08.789 --> 01:08:10.789
Well, assist.

01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:13.789
It may be that you can provide transportation yourself,

01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:16.789
or it may be a matter of helping the student

01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:18.789
to know where the Kingdom Hall is

01:08:18.789 --> 01:08:24.789
and then helping him to understand the public transportation system.

01:08:24.789 --> 01:08:29.789
But whatever help is needed, take those steps.

01:08:29.789 --> 01:08:33.789
Ensure that your student has wholesome association.

01:08:33.789 --> 01:08:35.789
As time goes by,

01:08:35.789 --> 01:08:39.789
your student is sure to lose former associates,

01:08:39.789 --> 01:08:42.789
either because the student decides

01:08:42.789 --> 01:08:45.789
or the former associates decide.

01:08:45.789 --> 01:08:47.789
Fill the void.

01:08:47.789 --> 01:08:51.789
And include your student in gatherings

01:08:51.789 --> 01:08:58.069
and keeping with his spiritual advancement and as appropriate.

01:08:58.069 --> 01:09:02.069
Finally, show fellow feeling.

01:09:02.069 --> 01:09:05.069
Remember, empathy is not a technique.

01:09:05.069 --> 01:09:09.069
It's a quality that springs from the heart.

01:09:09.069 --> 01:09:12.069
And it's communicated in so many ways.

01:09:12.069 --> 01:09:15.069
Not just our words and our actions,

01:09:15.069 --> 01:09:19.069
our facial expressions, our gestures, our body language,

01:09:19.069 --> 01:09:22.069
all communicate a message to the student.

01:09:22.069 --> 01:09:25.069
And the student will discern very quickly

01:09:25.069 --> 01:09:30.069
if our words and actions are motivated by love.

01:09:30.069 --> 01:09:34.069
If they are, then we are demonstrating empathy

01:09:34.069 --> 01:09:39.069
and reflecting the love and concern that Jehovah has for the Bible student.

01:09:39.069 --> 01:09:44.069
And that is what will draw the student to Jehovah.

01:09:44.069 --> 01:09:49.069
What a privilege we have to share in this vital disciple-making work

01:09:49.069 --> 01:09:56.069
with Jehovah's help may each of us succeed in showing the quality of empathy.

01:09:56.069 --> 01:10:00.069
Brother Gary Broho, a helper to the service committee,

01:10:00.069 --> 01:10:03.069
will now present the final part of the symposium.

01:10:03.069 --> 01:10:07.069
Experience the joy of disciple-making.

01:10:07.069 --> 01:10:12.069
Improve your skills, reaching the heart.

01:10:12.069 --> 01:10:22.430
For anyone to become a servant of Jehovah,

01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:27.430
they must have gods were deeply implanted in their hearts.

01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:31.430
Now, why is it so necessary for us to understand that?

01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:36.430
And what skills will help us to reach the heart of our students?

01:10:36.430 --> 01:10:41.430
Jesus gave an indication in His illustration of the soar.

01:10:41.430 --> 01:10:47.430
It's found in Matthew chapter 13, and we'll read verse 19.

01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:50.430
Matthew 13, verse 19.

01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:55.430
It says, where anyone hears the word of the kingdom,

01:10:55.430 --> 01:11:00.430
but does not get the sense of it, the wicked one comes and snatches away

01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:03.430
what has been so in his heart.

01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:11.430
So the word of the kingdom is likened to seeds and the soil to the figurative heart.

01:11:11.430 --> 01:11:15.430
Now, the figurative heart represents what a person is inside.

01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:20.430
It involves his feelings, his affections, his desires, his motives.

01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:26.430
Also, what he thinks about and how those thoughts affect decisions in his life.

01:11:26.430 --> 01:11:32.430
If you look back at verse 19, Jesus said that the seed in this case didn't grow

01:11:32.430 --> 01:11:37.430
because the individual didn't get the sense of the good news.

01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:43.430
Now, Jesus has given all of us this assignment to make disciples of people of all nations

01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:45.430
and baptizing them.

01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:51.430
So our teaching needs to help our students get the sense of the good news

01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:54.430
and that's going to move them to action.

01:11:54.430 --> 01:12:02.430
Proverbs chapter 3 and verse 1 highlights an importance of this type of teaching to us.

01:12:02.430 --> 01:12:06.430
It's Proverbs 3 and verse 1.

01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:14.430
It says, my son, do not forget my teaching and may your heart observe my commandments.

01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:20.430
So obedience to God must come from the heart as it indicates.

01:12:20.430 --> 01:12:27.430
So brothers and sisters, it's our responsibility to learn how to reach the heart of our students

01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:35.430
so that their thinking, their feelings, their reasonings will move them to be obedient to Jehovah God.

01:12:36.430 --> 01:12:44.430
As you watch the following dramatization, notice how Nita strives to reach the heart of her Bible student.

01:12:45.899 --> 01:12:49.899
Think any more about what we talked about on Monday?

01:12:49.899 --> 01:12:51.899
I did.

01:12:51.899 --> 01:12:55.899
But why would Jehovah make a rule like that?

01:12:55.899 --> 01:12:59.899
No sex unless you're married. It's totally okay.

01:12:59.899 --> 01:13:05.899
It might seem odd, but what quality do you most appreciate about Jehovah?

01:13:06.899 --> 01:13:09.899
Who's love? Me too.

01:13:09.899 --> 01:13:15.899
So if he truly loves us, look at what he tells us at Isaiah 48 verse 17.

01:13:15.899 --> 01:13:26.899
I, Jehovah, am your God, your God, Jade.

01:13:26.899 --> 01:13:33.899
The one teaching you to benefit yourself, the one guiding you in the way you should walk.

01:13:33.899 --> 01:13:43.090
I don't get it. It just doesn't make sense.

01:13:43.090 --> 01:13:51.880
Question. Does a little child always understand why mum and dad warns them not to do certain things?

01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:55.159
Probably not.

01:13:55.159 --> 01:13:58.159
So why are the rules and warnings?

01:13:58.159 --> 01:14:01.159
Well, they love them, don't they?

01:14:01.159 --> 01:14:16.170
And so if Jehovah loves you, it often takes time to appreciate why Jehovah asks certain things of us.

01:14:18.539 --> 01:14:26.539
But if we really love him, we'll have faith that what he asks is for the best.

01:14:26.539 --> 01:14:37.550
The real question is, do you trust him?

01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:43.909
I won't do. I really do.

01:14:43.909 --> 01:14:58.239
This was a good example of how a Bible study conductor reaches the heart of a student.

01:14:58.239 --> 01:15:07.239
Nida was calmly helping Jade to link what she was learning in her study to her relationship with Jehovah God.

01:15:07.239 --> 01:15:15.239
It was not an intellectual exercise, so to speak, helping her to gain more knowledge about a certain subject.

01:15:15.239 --> 01:15:19.239
Now it's really helping the student to connect the dots, so to speak.

01:15:19.239 --> 01:15:25.239
See how the material applies to decisions that they're making in their life.

01:15:25.239 --> 01:15:32.239
Throughout the Bible study, we want to constantly direct attention to Jehovah God.

01:15:32.239 --> 01:15:37.239
And if we're talking too much as the teacher, it's going to be hard to accomplish that.

01:15:37.239 --> 01:15:50.239
Your effective use of questions can help them connect their Bible knowledge that they're receiving to the qualities of Jehovah God that's going to make them love him.

01:15:50.239 --> 01:15:56.239
Qualities such as his love, his goodness, and his righteousness.

01:15:56.239 --> 01:16:01.239
Here's an example of a question that might be used.

01:16:01.239 --> 01:16:07.239
Why do you think Jehovah would forbid a certain action?

01:16:07.239 --> 01:16:15.239
See, that kind of question is helping your student begin to understand the thinking of Jehovah God on matters.

01:16:15.239 --> 01:16:20.239
Did you notice it was not a yes or no question?

01:16:20.239 --> 01:16:23.239
The question actually started with why?

01:16:23.239 --> 01:16:34.239
And now that forces the student to go to another level of their thought process to explain the reason Jehovah forbids certain actions.

01:16:34.239 --> 01:16:39.239
And that's a very good method of reaching the heart of a student.

01:16:39.239 --> 01:16:42.239
Here's an example of another question.

01:16:43.239 --> 01:16:48.239
How does this show you that Jehovah is a loving father?

01:16:48.239 --> 01:16:51.239
There again, not a yes or no question.

01:16:51.239 --> 01:16:54.239
It's this time started with how?

01:16:54.239 --> 01:17:03.239
And that now requires the student to identify the evidence that proves that Jehovah is a loving father.

01:17:03.239 --> 01:17:10.239
Did you notice in the video that needless questions were touching Jade's heart?

01:17:10.239 --> 01:17:18.239
She was skilled at her choice of questions, but also in the tone of voice when she was asking those questions.

01:17:18.239 --> 01:17:22.239
She was not hurried or impatient to get an answer.

01:17:22.239 --> 01:17:27.239
She quietly waited for Jade to meditate on the question.

01:17:27.239 --> 01:17:33.239
Her method of teaching demonstrated a Bible principle that would be helpful for us to review.

01:17:33.239 --> 01:17:41.239
And it's found in Proverbs chapter 20 and verse 5.

01:17:41.239 --> 01:17:46.239
And Proverbs 20 and verse 5.

01:17:46.239 --> 01:17:55.239
It says, the thoughts of a man's heart are like deep waters, but the discerning man draws them out.

01:17:55.239 --> 01:18:00.239
And so the thoughts of a student are not always easily discernible.

01:18:00.239 --> 01:18:09.239
As it takes, it really takes a skill teacher to draw those out like deep waters the verse indicates.

01:18:09.239 --> 01:18:18.239
Through tactful questions then, you can help your student to examine how they feel about what they are learning.

01:18:18.239 --> 01:18:22.239
Some simple questions will help you do that.

01:18:22.239 --> 01:18:36.239
For instance, how do you feel about or what convinces you that or how would you react if?

01:18:36.239 --> 01:18:42.239
See, those are excellent questions to help to draw up the inner feelings of your student.

01:18:42.239 --> 01:18:50.239
Now, there's a caution in this process because generally it's going to take time to gain the trust of the student,

01:18:50.239 --> 01:18:54.239
so they'll be comfortable expressing their feelings.

01:18:54.239 --> 01:19:05.239
As the students love for Jehovah increases, they'll be motivated to make changes in their lives to please Jehovah God.

01:19:05.239 --> 01:19:14.239
First John 5 verse 3 says, this is what the love of God means that we observe His commandments.

01:19:14.239 --> 01:19:20.239
So obedience to His commandments then is linked to love for Him.

01:19:20.239 --> 01:19:31.239
And then addition, love for fellow humans, love for the Bible teachings that they're learning is going to help them to make any needed adjustments to their thinking.

01:19:31.239 --> 01:19:41.239
Rather than shame your student, help them to reason on the benefits of correcting wrong viewpoints.

01:19:41.239 --> 01:19:45.239
You call how Nida handle the situation with Jade.

01:19:45.239 --> 01:19:53.239
When Jade said Jehovah's law against having sex before marriage was totally archaic.

01:19:53.239 --> 01:20:05.239
Well, instead of scolding her, Nida skillfully used an example of a child not understanding the rules and regulations of the parent.

01:20:05.239 --> 01:20:20.239
And you could see as she was discussing that Jade started to make the connection that Jehovah's law is really an expression of His love for her just as a parent loves their child.

01:20:20.239 --> 01:20:29.779
Once the student develops this relationship with Jehovah God and desires to make Jehovah's heart happy,

01:20:30.779 --> 01:20:42.340
that's going to be the strongest motive for the individual to make whatever changes are necessary in their life to please Jehovah.

01:20:42.340 --> 01:20:51.340
While it is a privilege to be involved in the work of making disciples, Jehovah wants us to also enjoy this work.

01:20:51.340 --> 01:20:54.340
That was certainly the case with the Apostle Paul.

01:20:55.340 --> 01:21:02.340
Open your Bible to 1 Thessalonians chapter 2, 19 and 20.

01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:10.340
And let's see how he felt about God's message changing the lives of those that he preached to.

01:21:10.340 --> 01:21:15.970
It's 1 Thessalonians 2, 19 and 20.

01:21:15.970 --> 01:21:22.970
For what is our hope or joy or crown of exultation before our Lord Jesus at His presence?

01:21:22.970 --> 01:21:29.970
Is it not in fact you? You certainly are our glory and joy.

01:21:29.970 --> 01:21:42.970
Few joys in life can compare with helping someone come to an accurate knowledge of the truth and watch them to progress to dedication and baptism.

01:21:42.970 --> 01:21:51.970
We are so thankful to receive Jehovah's Holy Spirit and His guidance in helping us in this disciple making work.

01:21:51.970 --> 01:21:58.970
But we too must do our part in diligently improving in our skills.

01:21:58.970 --> 01:22:09.970
As this six-part symposium has highlighted, as we do our part in improving our teaching skills and all aspects of our ministry,

01:22:09.970 --> 01:22:15.970
we will find greater joy as God's fellow workers.

01:22:15.970 --> 01:22:20.760
Thank you, brothers, for those instructive talks.

01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:26.760
No doubt all of us could see areas in which we can improve as teachers.

01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:29.760
Please stand now if you are able to do so.

01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:35.760
And let us sing together song number 58, which is entitled, Searching for Friends of Peace.

01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:38.760
That song number 58.
