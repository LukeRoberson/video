00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:07.080
Let's start by asking a question, should the governing body and the brothers who are taking

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:14.900
the lead in our organization just mainly focus on spiritual matters and not be concerned

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.980
about financial matters?

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.960
Well, some may answer, yes, that's what they should be doing and perhaps these ones

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:30.739
may even feel a little embarrassed if money matters are mentioned at meetings or JW Broadcasting.

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:37.020
Perhaps they may feel that there's a precedent back in Acts chapter 6, where it speaks

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.219
about the days after Pentecost, where the daily food distribution was taking place.

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:48.899
We remember there, the apostles decided that they would delegate that work, the work

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.619
of giving food at the tables to a group of men and remember they said they would focus

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:59.859
then on the spiritual aspects, prayer and so on.

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:05.739
So is this the basis then for us to say that we should just focus on spiritual matters?

00:01:05.739 --> 00:01:11.299
Well, even looking at that account, we realized that the apostles were very much involved

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:12.739
with the arrangement, weren't they?

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:17.939
They set the arrangement in place, they made sure the food distribution took place, even

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.060
though they personally didn't go to the tables and hand out the food.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.379
But when we look at the scriptures, we see very clearly that although we have a spiritual

00:01:29.379 --> 00:01:36.459
responsibility, a spiritual work that we need to do, but also there is a physical side

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:41.540
to the relief ministry and many other aspects that we need to be concerned about.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.219
Let's take for example the Apostle Paul.

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:51.659
If you'd like to take your Bibles and turn with me to Galatians chapter 2, the time setting

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:59.780
is about the year 49 CE and Paul and Barnabas are in Jerusalem and here basically they

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.060
get the approval from the governing body to go out to the nations.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.900
So let's look at Galatians chapter 2 and verses 9 and 10.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:16.180
And when they recognized the underserved kindness that was given me, James and Cephas and

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.500
John, the ones who seemed to be pillars gave Barnabas and me the right hand of fellowship

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.219
or in other words they gave approval to them and support so that we should go to the nations,

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:30.500
but they to those who are circumcised.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.539
So here the assignment was given, but then in verse 10 notice they asked only that we

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:40.259
keep the poor in mind.

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:46.539
Notice Paul says and this I have also earnestly endeavoured to do.

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:54.300
So obviously this relief ministry involving financial matters was something of concern

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.099
to Paul, to interest to him.

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:03.740
So when we think about that we see how the Apostle Paul did apply this admonition in his

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:12.379
ministry, his third missionary tour, which took place between the years 52 to 56 CE, were

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:18.379
involved with collecting contributions and donations from the brothers to take back

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:24.699
for the poor brothers in Judea who had a very hard time at that particular period of time.

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:31.780
Let's look at an example of what Paul said in 1 Corinthians chapter 16.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:38.419
1 Corinthians chapter 16 and verses 1 through 4.

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:44.340
Here he speaking to the Corinthians says, now concerning the collection for the holy

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.740
ones, you may follow the directions I gave to the congregations of Galatia.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:56.219
On the first day of the every week each of you should set something aside according

00:03:56.219 --> 00:04:01.659
to his own means, so the collections will not take place when I arrive.

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:07.259
But when I get there I will send the man you approve of in your letters to take your

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:10.060
kind gift to Jerusalem.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:16.660
But now notice what Paul says in verse Paul, however if it seems advisable for me to go

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.180
there also, they will go there with me.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.540
So Paul in the midst of his third missionary tour, which of course had a great spiritual

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:33.420
theme, helping people preaching the good news, he was still interested in the collection

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.579
of funds that would help the brothers back in Jerusalem.

00:04:36.579 --> 00:04:42.300
And notice there in verse 4, he even raises the possibility of stopping his missionary

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.699
work and actually traveling back to Jerusalem.

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:48.019
Well that's exactly what happened.

00:04:48.019 --> 00:04:56.019
If you turn across to Romans, Romans chapter 15, we'll see what eventuated.

00:04:56.019 --> 00:04:59.139
Did it seem advisable for him to go back?

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:07.379
Well in Romans 15, 25 and 26, we're told, but now I'm about to travel to Jerusalem to

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:09.779
minister to the holy ones.

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:15.740
Now publications have made the points that this return to Jerusalem, the main purpose was

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:20.939
to take this money back to the brothers there in Judea.

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:25.939
And then he goes on to say, for those in Macedonia and Akeja have been pleased to share their

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:32.220
things by contribution to the poor among the holy ones in Jerusalem.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:38.139
So was the financial aspect, the taking of contributions and donations important to

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:39.139
Paul?

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:45.500
Yes, he viewed it important enough to actually put on hold his missionary work and make

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:46.899
that journey back.

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:50.980
And when we look at the background there, we see that perhaps there were nine brothers

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:57.300
that traveled together and these brothers then took these funds, probably a substantial

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.019
amount back to Jerusalem.

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:06.220
And we have made the comment that this perhaps helped with the safety element, but also credibility

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.899
to make sure that nobody could question Paul with the funds that he was taking back.

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:17.500
And there's also included Titus, men who were trustworthy and well-known and approved

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:23.100
of by the brothers there in the various parts of Europe and Asia.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:29.060
But were these gifts that they were taking just a matter of charity giving out freely

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.060
to others?

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:38.060
Well, let's look again in the scriptures this time to 2 Corinthians chapter 8, 2 Corinthians

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.420
chapter 8, and verses 13 through 15.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:47.420
And this gives us a reason we could say for the policy or the viewpoint that the governing

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:51.220
body has with regard to helping others.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.740
So 2 Corinthians 8, 13 through 15.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.139
For I do not want to make it easy for others, but difficult for you.

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:05.819
But that by means of an equalizing, your surplus at the present time might offset their

00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:14.500
need, so that their surplus might also offset your deficiency, that there may be an equalizing.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:20.220
Just as it is written, the person with much did not have too much, and the person with

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:24.019
little did not have too little.

00:07:24.019 --> 00:07:25.779
What's the principle here?

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:32.740
The principle is that even though these contributions were being given to poor brothers and sisters,

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:34.740
everyone had to do something.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:40.660
It wasn't just a charity where you gave money to the poor, but rather there was an expectation

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:46.180
that each person, whether they were poor or they had more, would do something towards the

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:47.500
situation.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.139
And that's exactly the view the governing body takes today.

00:07:51.139 --> 00:07:57.819
Yes, Bibles and Bible literature provided free of charge without cost to our brothers

00:07:57.819 --> 00:08:00.339
in all parts of the earth.

00:08:00.339 --> 00:08:04.500
And the brothers then donate according to their means.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:10.420
Kingdom halls are being built in many countries that can't afford to build kingdom halls.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:16.019
And yet again, the governing body allows the opportunity for the brothers in those countries

00:08:16.019 --> 00:08:20.180
to also donate toward the construction of kingdom halls.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.980
Why?

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:27.019
Christen and we'll probably say, well, these are poor people, let's just make it a charity.

00:08:27.019 --> 00:08:31.139
But you see, Jesus didn't stop the widow from putting the two coins in, did he?

00:08:31.139 --> 00:08:32.940
He didn't say, look, hold on.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:36.059
You need that, your poor.

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:37.940
Let the rich people put money in.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.539
Now, Jesus allowed her to make that donation, why?

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:46.500
Because that was her gift to Jehovah and Jehovah would bless her for doing that.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:52.379
So when we think about what's happening with regard to our organization, not only the

00:08:52.379 --> 00:08:58.340
printing of Bibles, literature, building of kingdom halls, and also this huge disaster

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:02.500
relief that continues on, what can we be happy with?

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:07.059
We can be happy with the viewpoint of the governing body and we can be very happy that

00:09:07.059 --> 00:09:12.019
the publishing committee of the governing body does look after our limited means.

00:09:12.019 --> 00:09:17.460
Yes, they care for the money so that when the governing body makes decisions about what

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:22.340
needs to be done, they don't say there's no money for it.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:27.820
Now they make sure that our limited funds are available for the important work to spiritually

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:31.539
feed people, but also help them in a physical sense too.
