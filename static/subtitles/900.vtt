00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:05.200
This year's drama, Commit Your Way to Jehovah,

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:11.199
was inspired by the real experiences of real families.

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:17.199
Worldwide, the number of people forcibly displaced by conflicts,

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:22.199
violence, persecution, and other disruptive events

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.199
has now passed 100 million, the highest on record.

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.200
This figure includes many of our brothers and sisters and their children.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.200
Let's review some scenes from the drama and consider what lessons we can learn from them.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:52.200
1. We must immediately and completely reject any compromise of our political neutrality.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.200
At first, a money firmly declined Denea's job offer

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.200
because it involved membership in a political party.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:10.200
But later, family pressure and the lure of money caused him to waver

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.200
and it almost cost him his life, too.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.200
We must be alert to influences that can shape our thinking.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.200
Amani's fellow elders followed the direction from the branch office

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.200
to prepare the congregation to flee.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:38.200
But Amani's past experiences and strong feelings made him think he knew better.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.200
3. We must be ready to flee in times of danger,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.200
even being ready, as Jesus said, to say goodbye to all our belongings.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:58.200
Yakubu, Sifa, and Musa took the direction seriously and got ready,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.200
but Amani hesitated.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.200
What about you?

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.199
Do you have a go-bag with essentials, important documents,

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:15.199
and an up-to-date list of emergency contacts, including those of your congregation elders?

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:20.199
Have you rehearsed an evacuation plan with your family?

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:30.199
4. We need to train our children to obey and trust Jehovah no matter what happens.

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:38.199
When children are well-trained, they can remain faithful even if they're separated from their parents.

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:41.199
What would your children do?

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:47.199
Let's see what helped Amani and Zawadi to make good decisions on their own.

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:57.620
What are we going to do?

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.819
Well, Dad said to keep on going towards the camp, remember?

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.819
Okay, but which way is the camp? There are two directions.

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.819
Well, I think the camp's that way.

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:21.189
I actually know I think it's that way.

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:24.189
How about always praise before making a decision?

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:27.569
You're right.

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.879
Let's pray together and ask Jehovah to help us.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:44.819
5. We must have strong faith.

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:52.819
This time, Amani kindly but firmly rejected Dania's pressure to return home.

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:58.819
Amani trusted in Jehovah and in the direction from his organization.

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:07.819
He did not waver and he counted on Mombi and Zawadi to be faithful to.

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:14.819
6. We must make the best of our circumstances wherever we are.

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:22.819
Did you notice how Amani and the other brothers and sisters kept life as normal and stable as possible?

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:31.819
They played with their children. They kept themselves in their clothes clean and their campsite sanitary.

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:39.819
They socialized with friends. They kept up their routine of preaching, studying and attending meetings.

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:43.819
And they helped others.

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:50.819
7. We must show love for our brothers and others who are in need.

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:55.819
Not just in word, but indeed and truth.

00:04:55.819 --> 00:05:03.819
When disaster strike, our branch offices spring into action to provide material and spiritual aid.

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:12.819
We can help too by giving of our time and resources and by praying for our displaced brothers and sisters

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:15.819
and for those who are helping them.

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:24.819
The love we show among ourselves may also help still more people to take Jehovah's side.

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:36.819
Besides political crises, floods, wildfires and other disasters are increasing in frequency and destructiveness clearly.

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:42.819
All things are not continuing exactly as from creation's beginning.

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:49.819
Yet as bad as world conditions are now, Jesus said they'll get worse.

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:56.819
Worse than they've ever been in all of this world's terrible history.

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:03.819
Although we need to prepare in practical ways, we cannot prepare for everything.

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:12.819
Our survival and our salvation depend on committing our way to Jehovah.

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:27.819
So never allow pride, family, culture, money, possessions or anything else come between you and Jehovah.

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:39.819
Strengthen your faith and trust by absorbing Jehovah's thoughts found in the Bible and by staying close to your brothers and sisters.

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:45.819
You can count on Jehovah and our brotherhood to help you endure.

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:58.819
And may your constant prayer be to continue walking in Jehovah's way right on into the new world where he will make all things new.
