00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.750
It is my pleasure to introduce to this marriage gathering,

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.750
Brother and Sister Kalu.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:57.049
I finally told the elders everything.

00:00:57.049 --> 00:01:01.320
We're always arguing.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.320
There's no peace in my house.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.319
No one's happy.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:07.319
We just feel that is best at this point

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:09.319
if we just go our separate ways.

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:11.319
They patiently listen.

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:14.319
Then they reason that Jehovah can help us

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:17.319
even if we feel like we're in a loveless marriage.

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:20.319
One of the brothers shared Isaiah 48-17,

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:24.659
I, Jehovah, am your God,

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.659
the one teaching you to benefit yourself,

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.659
the one guiding you in the way you should walk.

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.659
After reading the scripture,

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.659
they explained that obeying God's laws

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.659
it really isn't that difficult.

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.659
They lovingly offer some Bible principles

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.659
to help me as the head of my family.

00:01:41.659 --> 00:02:06.500
It is God's name, as you care.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.500
Jehovah.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.500
Very good.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.500
Marriage can be challenging,

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.500
especially with two imperfect people involved.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.500
But if we obey,

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.500
we stick with our mate and we don't give up.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.500
In the end, we benefit ourselves

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.500
and things will get better.
