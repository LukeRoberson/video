00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:17.929
Welcome to the powerful by faith convention of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:23.929
You'll certainly be happy that you made the effort to attend all three days of this convention.

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:33.929
The expression, powerful by faith, is drawn from the Apostle Paul's words at Romans 4 and verse 20.

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:39.929
Why did the governing body choose faith as the theme for this year's convention?

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:48.929
Because we need strong faith to deal successfully with our present trials and with those we'll face in the near future.

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:56.929
At Matthew chapter 17 and verse 20, Jesus assured His disciples.

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:03.929
If you have faith, the size of a mustard grain, you will say to this mountain,

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:10.930
move from here to there, and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:17.930
Yes, faith enables us to do things we could never imagine doing on our own.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.930
For Christians, faith is essential.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.930
In fact, God commands us to have faith.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.930
At first John chapter 3 and verse 23 we read,

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:39.930
Indeed, this is His commandment, that we have faith in the name of His Son, Jesus Christ,

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.930
and love one another, just as He gave us a commandment.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.930
And Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 6 tells us,

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.930
Without faith, it is impossible to police God well.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:05.930
For whoever approaches God must believe that He is, and that He becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking Him.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:17.930
Clearly, to receive Jehovah's blessing and gain the reward of everlasting life, we need to build and maintain faith.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.930
At Romans chapter 1 verse 17, quoting the prophet Habakkuk, Paul wrote,

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.930
The righteous one will live by reason of faith.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:37.930
With these words, Paul emphasized that Jehovah will reward all who show real faith.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.930
Based on our faith in Jesus' ransom, Jehovah forgives our sins,

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.930
and grants us a righteous standing with Him even now.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.930
And during Armageddon, Jehovah will protect God's people,

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.930
and then give them the opportunity to live forever in paradise.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.930
That's what we want for all of you.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.930
Most of us here today already have a large measure of faith.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.930
And as Paul wrote, at 2 Corinthians chapter 1 and verse 24,

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.930
It is by your faith that you are standing.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.930
Reports from around the globe testify to your genuine faith,

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.930
and the good that Jehovah is accomplishing through you because of your faith.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:33.930
We feel as Paul expressed a Colossians chapter 1 and verses 3 and 4.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:40.930
We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you,

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:48.930
since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and the love you have for all the holy ones.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:55.930
But constant pressure from Satan and the demons, the old world and our own imperfections,

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.930
can weaken and wear down our faith.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.930
The purpose of this convention is to strengthen that faith.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.930
We'll learn how to cultivate true faith, how to exercise it in our daily lives,

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.930
and how to maintain it during difficult times.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.930
So please, pay close attention to each part of the program.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.930
As scriptures are read, follow along in the Bible,

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:32.930
and may God's Word empower you to be a man, woman or child of faith.
