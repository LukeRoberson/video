00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:14.910
Welcome to J.W. Broadcasting. This month we'll discuss something that's easy to talk about but difficult to do, making wise decisions.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.910
We'll hear what wise choices Greg and Jordan Harris made as they raised their children.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.910
We'll also catch up with Enrique Torres, a man who made great changes in his life.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.910
And we'll learn what helped him to stick to those changes.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:38.909
And the latest episode of Iron Sharp and Zion will show us how to be adaptable in our ministry.

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:44.909
This is J.W. Broadcasting for April 2023.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.989
The theme of this month's program is, make wise decisions.

00:01:07.989 --> 00:01:15.989
Now, discussion is based on Job 34 verse 11. Let's read that together.

00:01:15.989 --> 00:01:28.430
For he, Jehovah, will reward a man according to what he does and bring upon him the consequences of his ways.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:38.430
As highlighted in the scripture, our actions are very important and our actions are usually the result of decisions we make.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:46.430
Some decisions are made after a lot of serious thought. Others though are made very quickly.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:54.430
But no matter how much thought goes into making a decision, we need to recognize this basic fact.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:05.430
Wise decisions bring positive rewards and wrong decisions can result in very negative consequences.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.430
Of course, all of us want to make wise decisions, but what are wise decisions?

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.430
Wise decisions are those that please our Heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:29.430
Most of us have already made some very good decisions. These include the big decisions in life such as dedicating ourselves to Jehovah and getting baptized.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.430
And deciding not to become involved in the religious and political disputes of this world.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:44.430
No doubt before we made those major decisions, we spend a lot of time praying about them and seeking Jehovah's direction.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.430
And we have seen his blessing in our lives because of these right decisions.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.430
In this program though, we won't be discussing such major decisions.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.430
Rather, we'll focus on decisions that may be viewed by some as minor.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:10.430
However, some of these can lead to very serious consequences.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:19.430
First we'll consider a Bible example of a person who served Jehovah and yet made some wrong decisions along the way.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.430
We'll analyze what caused this faithful servant to make these wrong decisions.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.430
Then we'll consider what we need to do in order to make wise decisions.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:39.430
Finally, we'll consider what we need to do if we realize we've already made an unwise decision.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:48.430
So to start, let's discuss a faithful servant of Jehovah who made some unwise decisions.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.430
The example we have in mind is that of King Jehosephat.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.430
What was Jehovah's view of King Jehosephat?

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:05.430
Let's see the answer at 2 Chronicles 17 and verses 3 and 4.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:16.430
Jehovah continued with Jehosephat because he walked in the former ways of his forefather David and did not search for the bails.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:23.430
But he searched for the God of his father and followed his commandment and not the practices of Israel.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:29.129
That sounds like a wonderful commendation, doesn't it?

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:33.129
Yes, Jehosephat was a faithful King.

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:37.129
He made the wise decision to worship Jehovah.

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:44.129
But even so, he still made some very unwise decisions.

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:53.439
Let's read about one of those unwise decisions at 2 Chronicles chapter 18 and verse 1.

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:57.439
Jehosephat had riches and glory and abundance.

00:04:57.439 --> 00:05:03.439
But he made a marriage alliance with Ahab.

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:07.439
Yes, he made his son marry Ahab's daughter, Atholah.

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:11.439
Now that was a very unwise decision.

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:21.439
Why? Because Ahab had built a temple for bale and had even employed 850 false prophets.

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:26.439
Ahab was also married to wicked Queen Jezebel.

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:30.439
Who would want the child to marry into such a bad family?

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:34.439
What was Jehosephat thinking?

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:37.439
Why did he arrange for this marriage?

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:47.439
Perhaps he wanted to reunite the 12 tribes or he may have had some political and commercial motives for wanting to have Ahab as an ally.

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:55.439
Even though we don't know for sure the reason, we do know there were consequences.

00:05:55.439 --> 00:06:04.439
Because of this close relationship with Ahab, Jehosephat felt obligated to support Ahab in a war against the Sunians.

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:10.439
However, this led to yet another unwise decision.

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:18.439
As they were preparing for this battle, Jehosephat asked for direction from one of Jehovah's prophets.

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:27.439
Ahab though expressed his hatred for the prophet and after hearing the prophet's message had him thrown into prison.

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:33.439
At that point, it was decision time for Jehosephat.

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:36.439
What did he decide to do?

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:43.439
Although he initially disagreed with Ahab, he eventually joined him in the battle.

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:47.439
Jehosephat disregarded the warning from Jehovah.

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:56.439
But then this led him to still another unwise decision, this time an incredibly foolish decision.

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:58.439
What happened?

00:06:58.439 --> 00:07:04.439
Jehovah's prophet had foretold that the Israelites would lose their shepherd or king in battle.

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:12.439
So Ahab said that he would disguise himself and not enter the battle dressed as a king.

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:17.439
He then said that Jehosephat should still dress like a king.

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:20.439
Now just think about that for a moment.

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:23.439
Ahab was basically saying,

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:29.439
you go out into the battle with a target on your back and all hide in disguise.

00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:31.439
Really?

00:07:31.439 --> 00:07:37.439
Jehosephat's decision to agree to do that was not only unwise but also foolish.

00:07:37.439 --> 00:07:40.439
It nearly cost him his life.

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:43.439
So why would he do that?

00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:52.439
Inside on the scripture says that perhaps Jehosephat didn't want to go back on his original promise to accompany Ahab.

00:07:52.439 --> 00:07:58.439
So maybe he would have lost face if he backed out of the agreement at that point.

00:07:58.439 --> 00:08:09.439
Although Jehosephat did survive the battle, Jehovah sent another prophet to him to say what's recorded at 2 Chronicles 19 verse 2.

00:08:09.439 --> 00:08:16.439
Is it the wicked you should be helping and is it those who hate Jehovah you should love?

00:08:17.439 --> 00:08:23.439
Because of this, the indignation of Jehovah is against you.

00:08:23.439 --> 00:08:30.439
Although Jehovah acknowledged the good things that Jehosephat had accomplished in other aspects of his life,

00:08:30.439 --> 00:08:35.440
Jehosephat clearly made some very unwise decisions.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.440
What lessons do we learn from Jehosephat's wrong decisions?

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:50.440
Lesson 1. Just because we've done many good things in Jehosephat's service doesn't mean that we'll always make wise decisions.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:09:00.440
Lesson 2. Making friendships with those who hate Jehosephat can put us under pressure to make other unwise decisions.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:06.440
Lesson 3. Even though we may seek Jehosephat's direction,

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:11.440
we must follow it if we want to make wise decisions.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:23.440
Lesson 4. If we realize that we've made an unwise decision, don't keep going in the same course. Stop and change direction.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:31.440
These lessons can be summarized in the words of Proverbs 22 verse 3. There we told,

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:36.440
the shrewd one sees the danger and conceals himself,

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:43.440
but the inexperience keeps right on going and suffer the consequences.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:51.440
Yes, we need to see the possible consequences of wrong decisions and then take action to avoid them.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:57.440
What were some of the consequences of Jehosephat's unwise decisions?

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:02.440
It nearly cost him his life. His oldest son died in apostate,

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:14.440
and later his daughter-in-law, Atholaya, killed all the heirs to the throne, except one baby, and set herself up as queen of Judah.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:22.440
But you might be thinking, still Jehosephat viewed Jehosephat as a good king. Yes, he did.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:28.440
And it's encouraging for us to know that even if we have made some unwise decisions,

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:34.440
it's possible that Jehovah may still view us as his faithful servants.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:40.440
Does that mean, then, that our decisions are not so important?

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:45.440
The Watchtower back in 1980 made this interesting comparison.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:49.440
It used an illustration of two ship captains.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:56.440
One skillfully maneuvered his ship through a storm, bringing the vessel and his crew safely to shore,

00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:00.440
but the other captain made unwise decisions.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:08.440
And because of that, he experienced shipwreck during the same storm, saving only his life.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:20.440
While both captains escaped with their lives, the one whose ship remained intact would certainly enjoy greater happiness and honour, wouldn't he?

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.440
It's obvious which captain Jehosephat was like.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:34.440
Unlike Jehosephat, surely we'd prefer to be like the successful captain, the one whose ship remained intact.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:39.440
How can we make sure that we are like the successful captain?

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:49.440
Back in 2011, the April Watchtower had a special chart entitled Steps to Making Good Decisions.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:55.440
It listed these steps in making wise decisions.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:59.440
One, avoid being presumptuous.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.440
Two, do research.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.440
Three, pray for wisdom.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.440
Four, make the decision.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.440
Five, implement the decision.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.440
But then there was an additional step.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.440
Six, review and adjust.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.440
Why is Step 6 listed?

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:28.440
Well, from time to time, we need to review decisions we've already made.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:36.440
As we do so, perhaps we'll come to realise that some of them were not the best decisions.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:39.440
Can you still be like the successful captain?

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.440
Yes, you can.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.440
How?

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:46.440
If you courageously make the needed adjustments.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:52.440
We must acknowledge that not all decisions work out exactly as we had planned.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:13:00.440
As Ecclesiastes 9-11 reminds us, time and unexpected events overtake us all.

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:04.440
So what should we do if that's the case?

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:10.440
The same Watchtower in 2011 answers that question for us.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:18.440
After saying that Jehovah expects us to live up to such decisions as our dedication and our marriage vows,

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.440
it went on to say,

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:24.440
most decisions, though, are less waiting.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:30.440
A wise person will, from time to time, review the decisions he has made.

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:37.440
He will not let pride or stubbornness prevent him from adjusting or even reversing a decision.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:46.440
His prime concern is to make sure that his life course continues to honor God.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:55.440
Thinking back to the illustration of the two captains, at times they may need to reverse a former unwise decision.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:01.440
That happened during a hurricane back in 1889.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:12.440
The captain of the British ship Caliope was anchored in the harbor in Apia, Western Samoa, when a hurricane started blowing.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:19.440
Initially, he decided like all the other captains in the harbor to weather the storm where he was.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:28.440
But as the waves grew in height and the dangers increased, the captain realized he had made the wrong decision.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.440
What did he do?

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:36.440
He courageously reversed his decision and headed out to open sea.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:46.440
It was difficult, but ultimately he saved himself, his ship, and the 250 sailors on board.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:51.440
This bold act of courage ended him into the annals of naval history.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:15:00.720
To be like that courageous captain, at times we need to prayerfully reexamine our past decisions.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:08.720
These could be decisions about our employment, entertainment, education, or even where we live.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:14.720
When we made the original decisions, they may have seemed wise to us.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:18.720
But do they still seem that way now?

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:25.720
If we see the dangerous winds of bad consequences and the frightening waves of disaster approaching,

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:31.720
because our decisions were not completely in harmony with Jehovah's will, what should we do?

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.720
Be like the wise captain.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:42.720
Don't worry about losing face, be courageous, pray for Jehovah's help, and then take bold action.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:47.720
Make the changes you need to make in order to continue to please Jehovah.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:51.720
In this way, you'll make the wise decision.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:56.720
The one that leads to success, the one that Jehovah will bless.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:07.220
One thing that will help us make wise decisions is to remember the big picture, not just what happens today,

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:10.220
but how this will affect our future.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:15.220
In other words, don't just think of now.

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:17.220
Think of forever.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:21.220
That's the theme of our music video for this month.

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:46.179
In this world, it can be hard, not just to follow your heart, to be different, into what's right.

00:16:46.179 --> 00:17:01.179
But Jehovah tells us in his word, don't be molded by this worldly promises life, in paradise.

00:17:01.179 --> 00:17:04.180
You'll stand tall.

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:12.819
Give Jehovah's right there with you.

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:16.819
He won't let you fall.

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:30.980
And pray day to climb those mountains out there, standing in your way.

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:41.299
Hold only for the day before forever.

00:17:41.299 --> 00:17:51.430
But we'll try and offer fame.

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:55.430
We'll do spotlight on your name.

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:59.970
Raise you up, we're all to see.

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:18.509
But rather than strive after wind, Jehovah says reach out to him, he promises life, in paradise.

00:18:18.509 --> 00:18:22.509
So stand tall.

00:18:22.509 --> 00:18:31.619
Give Jehovah's right there with you.

00:18:31.619 --> 00:18:34.619
He won't let you fall.

00:18:34.619 --> 00:18:48.089
And pray day to climb those mountains out there, standing in your way.

00:18:48.089 --> 00:18:53.589
Hold only for the day.

00:18:53.589 --> 00:19:23.119
So stand tall.

00:19:23.119 --> 00:19:29.480
Give Jehovah's right there with you.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:46.339
Those mountains out there, standing in your way.

00:19:46.339 --> 00:20:18.059
No matter how long we've been serving Jehovah, or what changes we face in life, we can always keep our hope of living forever.

00:20:18.059 --> 00:20:25.059
Reflecting on this hope can help us make wise decisions at any stage in life.

00:20:25.059 --> 00:20:32.059
Earlier we discussed that at times, we need to review a decision we made previously.

00:20:32.059 --> 00:20:38.059
In our next segment, a family decides to move to a foreign language field.

00:20:38.059 --> 00:20:42.059
Does this prove to be a wise decision for them?

00:20:42.059 --> 00:20:52.000
Let's see how things turn out.

00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:16.589
Hey you, are you ready?

00:21:16.589 --> 00:21:26.029
The Haitian community in our area was growing, and the new Haitian Creole congregation was formed nearby.

00:21:26.029 --> 00:21:31.029
We checked out their territory and saw they needed a lot of help.

00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:37.720
So, should we do this?

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:41.720
I've been praying for more studies. I think this might just be my answer.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:45.720
Yeah, I'm in. Good. Then as soon as we get home, we can pray about it.

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:53.789
Our new language was exciting.

00:21:53.789 --> 00:22:02.470
We spent every spare second we had trying to get better.

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:07.470
We had so much joy, but we had challenges too.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
Could you read the next paragraph first, please?

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
Yeah, sorry where are we?

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:55.410
Our study was so nice today, wasn't it Nicholas?

00:22:55.410 --> 00:23:00.410
It was. And yet again, I was totally lost.

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:06.410
We didn't realise that Nico just wasn't finding the same joy as us.

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:13.069
To help Nico, we did a few more things in our language.

00:23:14.539 --> 00:23:20.539
Besides family worship, we attended one meeting a month with our old congregation.

00:23:21.539 --> 00:23:24.539
Well, honestly, I'm a little worried about Nico.

00:23:24.539 --> 00:23:27.539
He's having a tough time adapting to our new congregation.

00:23:27.539 --> 00:23:29.539
Hmm, I get it.

00:23:29.539 --> 00:23:34.539
You know, back when we first joined a foreign language congregation, everything was fun and new.

00:23:34.539 --> 00:23:39.539
But after a little while, we noticed that our kids had lost their enthusiasm.

00:23:39.539 --> 00:23:45.539
They were still hearing about Jehovah, but honestly, they weren't learning because it wasn't in their language.

00:23:45.539 --> 00:23:47.539
Is that why you moved back?

00:23:47.539 --> 00:23:50.539
It was, but at every family is different.

00:23:50.539 --> 00:23:53.539
We each have to decide what's best for our own.

00:23:53.539 --> 00:23:55.539
Thanks, that's true.

00:23:55.539 --> 00:24:00.539
I found the perfect article to help us decide what to do.

00:24:00.539 --> 00:24:03.539
It mentioned the example of Daniel.

00:24:03.539 --> 00:24:07.539
He had to speak different languages every day.

00:24:07.539 --> 00:24:12.539
But he made sure to study in Hebrew, his language.

00:24:12.539 --> 00:24:18.109
The article mentioned Psalm 111.

00:24:18.109 --> 00:24:23.109
In my heart, I treasure up your saying.

00:24:23.109 --> 00:24:32.109
For Nico to treasure God's word in his heart, we felt he needed even more guidance in the language of his heart.

00:24:32.109 --> 00:24:39.279
The truth is, when I'm at the meeting in my language, it's different.

00:24:39.279 --> 00:24:42.279
I don't have to think a lot just to understand what I'm hearing.

00:24:42.279 --> 00:24:45.279
Well, I think it's clear what's best for our family.

00:24:45.279 --> 00:24:46.279
It is.

00:24:46.279 --> 00:24:48.279
But what about your students?

00:24:48.279 --> 00:24:51.279
It's okay, Nico. We'll find a way to help them.

00:24:51.279 --> 00:24:54.279
The language we're immersed in every day is the language of your heart.

00:24:54.279 --> 00:24:59.279
So it's best for you to keep growing spiritually in that same language.

00:24:59.279 --> 00:25:06.559
It was the best decision in order for Nico to stay close to Jehovah.

00:25:06.559 --> 00:25:12.019
But we did miss the Haitian Creole field.

00:25:12.019 --> 00:25:15.019
So, a few years later.

00:25:15.019 --> 00:25:17.019
Are you ready?

00:25:17.019 --> 00:25:20.019
I'm a little nervous, but I think I'm ready.

00:25:20.019 --> 00:25:29.430
We decided it was the right time to move back.

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:39.430
We're so glad our decision helped Nico build a solid foundation for his faith and his future.

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:49.059
How encouraging it was to be reminded that when we make a decision, we can always make adjustments later.

00:25:50.059 --> 00:25:54.059
Have you ever made a decision that seemed wise at first?

00:25:54.059 --> 00:26:00.059
But then over time, as things changed in your life, didn't seem so good.

00:26:00.059 --> 00:26:05.059
Maybe you felt, I'll be a failure if I leave this assignment.

00:26:05.059 --> 00:26:14.059
Remember, our primary concern must be to make sure that our life course continues to honor God.

00:26:15.059 --> 00:26:20.059
Have the courage to consider making a change if your circumstances have changed.

00:26:20.059 --> 00:26:26.309
Greg and Jordan Harris raised their children to love Jehovah.

00:26:26.309 --> 00:26:31.750
What decisions did they make along the way?

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:38.750
When a person makes a sacrifice, they give up something for something that they consider is of higher value.

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:45.750
What kind of a price tag can you put on your child's love for Jehovah?

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:52.750
What kind of a price tag can you put on serving Jehovah whole soul as a family?

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:58.750
When I found out that we were going to have a family, it was overwhelming for me.

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:04.750
When you come into the truth, we weren't witnesses when I was a child.

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:11.750
Sometimes you're exposed to things that leave you with baggage, leave you unsure of yourself.

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:16.750
You need constant reassurance that you're going to be okay.

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:20.750
You can take care of any situation that comes along.

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:25.750
My dad, he gave me all I needed. He loved me so much.

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:31.750
I would take my mother's knitting yarn and tie it to his door handle after he went to sleep.

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:38.750
I would run it across the hall to my bedroom and tie it to my big toe so that when he opened his door in the morning I would wake up.

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:43.750
I could be with him that love that I had for my dad.

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:46.750
I wanted them to love Jehovah that much.

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:53.750
I wanted a string tight around their hearts right to Jehovah so that he was the one motivating them

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:57.750
and he was the one waking them up spiritually every day.

00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:04.750
I loved to teach the children things and I would do it at any available moment.

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:09.750
And then of course at night as a family, usually on our bed we would read our Bible together.

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:17.750
It was the glue that kept us tied to Jehovah and kept us tied to each other.

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:23.750
Judges 7, Gideon said, watch me and do what I do.

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:32.750
So I knew that if we wanted the children to live the truth that we had to live it with them,

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:35.750
it couldn't be something that we just taught them.

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:42.000
We had to live our life of service to Jehovah with them.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:51.000
Jesus said obviously we can't slave for two masters and I've tried to do that and believe me it does not work.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000
Like any father, I wanted to have a home for my family.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:02.000
My profession was building houses but that cost me my pioneering.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.000
And so I decided I had to quit building houses and so I did.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:16.000
I started to do remodeled jobs and we looked for a place that we could afford that would sustain us in the full-time service.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000
And Jehovah provided exactly what we needed.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:27.000
One of the highlights of raising the children was the annual visits to unassigned territory.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:36.000
The success in the ministry was phenomenal so we decided as a family to take on the challenge of learning Spanish.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:47.000
We had a large Spanish speaking population in our territory and in the surrounding territories and there was no group or congregation to help them.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:56.000
When we would go out of the country to preach, we would often stay with family members of our Bible students or our brothers and sisters

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.000
in these countries and some very humble surroundings.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:10.000
And we took advantage of the hospitality that they offered us because we wanted to live the culture with them.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:16.000
It just opened our eyes to a world that we never knew existed.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:28.000
Our family was able to progress and flourish spiritually because of a concentrated effort with Jordan and I.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000
She's been there to fill in all of the cracks.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:40.000
He always made it so easy to love him, to love the children and to really focus on spiritual things.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:49.000
When we prayed to Jehovah thinking about our family being able to serve him like this, we just say thank you.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:31:01.000
We just try in some way to express how deeply we feel about this privilege that we have to be with Carson and Cherstie and Andrea Dimo.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:28.000
We don't deserve any of these blessings from Jehovah but somehow he's blessed our efforts and he's given us an opportunity to smile and reflect on all of the things that he's done for us and what can we do to repage Jehovah but just keep going, keep trying and keep moving forward until we're on the other side.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:35.599
Thank you brother and sister Harris for sharing your experience in such a heartfelt way.

00:31:35.599 --> 00:31:44.599
You decided to put spiritual things first in your children's lives and gave them the chance to have a friendship with Jehovah.

00:31:44.599 --> 00:31:53.880
What happens to us in childhood can shape who we become as adults for better or for worse.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:59.880
If we don't like who we are now, we can change.

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:04.880
As we'll see in the latest installment of Where are they now?

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:16.579
Hello, who is it?

00:32:16.579 --> 00:32:18.579
Hey, how are you?

00:32:18.579 --> 00:32:19.579
Okay, come on up.

00:32:19.579 --> 00:32:22.579
My name is Enrique Torres Jr.

00:32:22.579 --> 00:32:43.730
I live in Staten Island in New York and I have the privilege to self in the Mid-Anon congregation.

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:51.730
First 40 years of my life, who are my life style, I was horrendous.

00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:58.359
A judge stated that I had a propensity for criminality.

00:32:58.359 --> 00:33:01.359
No doubt he was describing a vicious person.

00:33:01.359 --> 00:33:18.869
As a youth, I was hanging around with the wrong kind of people that led me into a life of crime and debauchery.

00:33:18.869 --> 00:33:30.869
This captain in our prison came up with a psychological plan to take the individuals that had the potential for leadership and put him in isolation.

00:33:30.869 --> 00:33:33.869
I wind up via a mountain.

00:33:33.869 --> 00:33:36.869
Can you imagine they were getting beat up?

00:33:36.869 --> 00:33:43.569
It was becoming too much for me, the screams and so forth.

00:33:43.569 --> 00:33:46.569
I said, this continuum, I'm not going to survive here.

00:33:46.569 --> 00:33:57.920
I did get in contact with my father and he told me, never forget Jehovah.

00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:03.920
That was his name and I saw, I got out of it.

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:08.920
I knew that there was nobody that could help me but God.

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:12.920
So that's when I found myself in prayer to Jehovah.

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:20.920
I vowed that I would make my business to learn more about him than just his name at that time. That's all I knew.

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:24.920
I got some literature, I got the Bible too.

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:31.920
Jehovah became all meaningful to me. That's when he became real to me.

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:34.920
That was the first 40 years of my life.

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:45.920
But the last 40 years of my life with Jehovah's training from his organization, my personality was transformed.

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:58.920
The blessings that I have received has been in the area of my field service and also my teaching ability, which has helped me to be able to draw closer to Jehovah.

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:07.920
I was privileged to become a ministerial servant for many years, field service over here for many more years.

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:24.840
One of the main challenges that I'm facing is that I have developed cancer and have gone through four cancer operations and also some chemotherapy.

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:35.840
Without relying upon Jehovah to help me to overcome these challenges, there's no doubt in my mind that I never would have been able to make it.

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:44.789
I would recommend to avoid that trap that I fell into hanging around with street gangs.

00:35:45.789 --> 00:35:52.789
And then I'm getting involved in burglaries, robberies with some progression.

00:35:52.789 --> 00:35:56.789
It was not all anything of value at all.

00:35:56.789 --> 00:36:07.679
And instead what it brought me was a lot of grief, mental scars, and also a lot of trouble with my conscience.

00:36:07.679 --> 00:36:14.679
I've studied God's word of the Bible so that you may be able to see what Jehovah has in store for the future.

00:36:14.679 --> 00:36:25.679
And also you'll be able to see that he's a kind, merciful, loving God that doesn't want no one to be destroyed but wants them to have life.

00:36:25.679 --> 00:36:31.679
Parents, never give up on your children. Jehovah never gave up on me.

00:36:31.679 --> 00:36:38.219
And he rescued me from the spiritual darkness that I was in.

00:36:38.219 --> 00:36:44.219
And he brought me into his light and to his wonderful organization.

00:36:44.219 --> 00:36:51.219
And I give him all the credit for that. And when I speak to people, that's what I tell them.

00:36:51.219 --> 00:37:05.909
I tell them it wasn't me. It's Jehovah that's done all of this. And it could do that for you too if you give him an opportunity.

00:37:05.909 --> 00:37:12.909
Early in life, Enrique's poor choice of friends led him to make many other bad decisions.

00:37:12.909 --> 00:37:17.909
But in his 40s, he decided to get to know Jehovah.

00:37:17.909 --> 00:37:23.909
What a good reminder that we can continue to make changes later on in life.

00:37:23.909 --> 00:37:34.909
And you parents, please keep in mind that the seeds of truth you planted in your children's hearts can move them to make good decisions later, even as adults.

00:37:35.909 --> 00:37:45.449
Some of our decisions may seem small, yet they can have a powerful effect on our brotherhood.

00:37:45.449 --> 00:37:55.449
In the next video, Brother Robert Lutcioni discusses how our response to someone can make peace or break it.

00:37:55.449 --> 00:38:05.789
So our scripture text for today discusses the qualities needed to walk worthily and in a way that pleases Jehovah.

00:38:05.789 --> 00:38:12.789
Now, you notice our scripture in scripture text Ephesians 4.1 is only a partial sentence.

00:38:12.789 --> 00:38:19.789
Let's read the entire sentence, which takes in verses 1 through 3. Ephesians 4 verses 1 through 3.

00:38:19.789 --> 00:38:32.789
He says, therefore, I, the prisoner in the Lord, appeal to you to walk worthily of the calling for which you recalled with all humility and mildness with patience, putting up with one another in love.

00:38:32.789 --> 00:38:39.789
Earnestly endeavoring to maintain the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace.

00:38:39.789 --> 00:38:47.789
So here the Apostle Paul links walking worthily with unity, and you notice the qualities that are needed to do that.

00:38:47.789 --> 00:38:51.789
He says that we need humility, mildness, and patience.

00:38:51.789 --> 00:38:57.789
Now, this is not the only time that the Apostle Paul links these three qualities with being in unity.

00:38:57.789 --> 00:39:05.789
We may remember Colossians chapter 3 and verse 12, and it tells us to clothe ourselves with humility, mildness, and patience.

00:39:05.789 --> 00:39:09.789
Why? So that we can continue putting up with one another.

00:39:09.789 --> 00:39:15.789
So why are these qualities so essential to peace and to unity? What would the scriptures say about them?

00:39:15.789 --> 00:39:26.789
Well, perhaps we think of the scripture in Philippians chapter 2, verse 3 and 4, which says, do nothing out of contentiousness or egotism, but with humility, consider others superior to you.

00:39:26.789 --> 00:39:41.789
See, that brings about peace and unity, or a proverb, chapter 15 and verse 1, a mild answer turns away rage, or proverb, chapter 25, 15, by patience, a commander is one over.

00:39:41.789 --> 00:39:45.789
See, humility, mildness, patience.

00:39:45.789 --> 00:39:55.789
These qualities are so vital for taking tension out of a situation and allowing for humility and for unity and peace.

00:39:55.789 --> 00:40:03.789
Now, there's many accounts in the Bible that illustrate this fact, and we're going to consider just one, that of the Ephraimites and Gideon.

00:40:03.789 --> 00:40:10.789
If you're looking at your Bibles in Judges chapter 6 and 7, it sets out the account of Gideon going against the Midianites.

00:40:10.789 --> 00:40:20.789
We remember a response to Jehovah's direction, Gideon went against Midian, first with 32,000 men, and then finally weeded down to only 300 men.

00:40:21.789 --> 00:40:31.789
Now, if you look in your Bibles, the study Bible map B6, it helps us to visualize the strategy that Gideon used with Jehovah's direction.

00:40:31.789 --> 00:40:37.789
Now, the Midianites gather near the hill of Maurei, and you can see that here on the map.

00:40:37.789 --> 00:40:45.789
And if you look at Judges chapter 6 and verse 34, we're reminded that Jehovah's Spirit came upon Gideon.

00:40:45.789 --> 00:40:55.789
So here he's operating under Jehovah's Spirit. So what did he do? First off, he calls on the tribes of Manasseh, Asher, Zebulin, and Nathdalai to assist.

00:40:55.789 --> 00:41:00.789
And that makes sense, because you can see where those tribes were in relation to where the fighting was going to be.

00:41:00.789 --> 00:41:11.789
Then in Judges chapter 7, verse 22, Gideon's initial attack through the Midianites into confusion, and so the Midianites flee south toward Abel Miholla.

00:41:12.789 --> 00:41:22.789
Verse 23 of chapter 7 says that he then calls on Nathdalai, Asher, and Manasseh to chase after them, and push them toward the south, further south.

00:41:22.789 --> 00:41:25.789
And you can see the logic in that.

00:41:25.789 --> 00:41:36.789
But then in an excellent strategy, in verse 24 and 25, to head them off, he also calls on Ephraim to capture the waters as far as Bethbara and Black Bear Escape.

00:41:36.789 --> 00:41:43.789
And they do. And they're successful. The two main princes of Midian are killed. It's victory.

00:41:43.789 --> 00:41:49.789
An excellent strategy, one of the greatest and most courageous and bravest battles in the Bible.

00:41:49.789 --> 00:41:57.789
In fact, interestingly, there's no record ever again of the Midianites bothering Jehovah's people after this victory.

00:41:57.789 --> 00:42:07.789
Can you imagine having a share in that project? How excited you would be? Well, not everybody was. Look at Judges chapter 8 and verse 1.

00:42:08.789 --> 00:42:20.789
It says, then the men of Ephraim said to him, to Gideon, what have you done to us? Why did you not call us when you went to fight against Midian? And they quarreled bitterly with him?

00:42:20.789 --> 00:42:35.789
What was Ephraim's problem? Well, they felt they should have been involved earlier, or perhaps the situation should have been handled different. Why weren't we involved? Why didn't you call us? We didn't know anything that was going on. Then we had to drop everything and come and bail you out.

00:42:35.789 --> 00:42:44.789
Well, did Ephraim have humility, maleness, and patience? Well, far from it. And it was disrupting unity.

00:42:44.789 --> 00:42:56.789
Now, how did Gideon respond? No, remember Gideon had Jehovah's spirit, and he had an excellent strategy that led to an outstanding victory for Jehovah. How did he respond? Well, look at verses 2 and 3.

00:42:57.789 --> 00:43:18.789
It says, but he said to them, what have I done compared with you? Are not the gleanings of Ephraim better than the great harvest of Abysir? It was into your hand that God gave Midian's princes Orab and Zia. And what have I done compared with you? When he spoke this way, they calmed down.

00:43:19.789 --> 00:43:30.789
You see Gideon showed humility, maleness, and patience. And the result, everyone calmed down and Gideon was able to get on with Jehovah's work at hand.

00:43:30.789 --> 00:43:43.789
Now, we contrast that to the next time that the Ephraimites pulled the same trick as recorded in judges chapter 12. There, you remember they accused Jehovah of not calling them into battle, same story.

00:43:44.789 --> 00:43:53.789
Well, you said, well, I did call you into battle and you didn't come. So I just did it myself. Next, you know, they're fighting among themselves completely distracted from carrying on Jehovah's work.

00:43:53.789 --> 00:44:10.789
What's the lesson? Well, the lesson is is that things happen at times that makes peace go away. Sometimes brothers in the congregation at Bethel on a construction site may react like Ephraimites.

00:44:10.789 --> 00:44:22.789
Sometimes we react like Ephraimites. But why didn't you ask my opinion? I was supposed to be involved in this. Why'd you call me last minute when you knew you needed this two weeks ago, and now I have to drop everything and help you out?

00:44:22.789 --> 00:44:37.789
See, that happens that we're only human. Well, when it happens, how will we react? You say unity is more important than who was right and who is wrong and Gideon understood that simple truth.

00:44:37.789 --> 00:44:52.789
And unity is so important today. It was interesting. A beautiful watchtower article 2014, December 15th, and the article was entitled facing the end of this old world together. And it stated this.

00:44:52.789 --> 00:45:01.789
It said, one of the darkest periods in human history, nears. For God's people, it will be a time for unity.

00:45:01.789 --> 00:45:09.789
It goes on to say, during the coming time of trouble for this system, we will have to be truly united.

00:45:09.789 --> 00:45:20.789
So let me ask you, do you think it's any coincidence that here where we are in the stream of time that we see Jehovah pulling his organization closer and closer together in unity?

00:45:20.789 --> 00:45:32.789
Is it any coincidence that we hear over and over again the need for peace and for unity? No. You see, is this world gets more and more divided, fragmented, fighting?

00:45:32.789 --> 00:45:43.789
We need to pull tighter and tighter together in unity. And that requires that all of us work on these beautiful qualities of humility, mildness, and patience.

00:45:43.789 --> 00:45:53.789
And when there's a lack of unity, what do we have to do? Well, we have to look at ourselves. You see, generally, we find that the problem is me. It's us.

00:45:53.789 --> 00:46:07.789
Maybe we weren't consulted as soon as we should have been. Or maybe the our idea of how the work or this thing should be done wasn't shared by others. But in the grand scheme of things, does it really make a difference?

00:46:08.789 --> 00:46:19.789
And many times when we look at a situation afterwards and we pull back unemotionally, we generally find that, well, maybe our idea was pretty good, but the timing wasn't good.

00:46:19.789 --> 00:46:32.789
Or maybe it wasn't that great of an idea after all. Or maybe there was more than one way for this thing to be handled. Or perhaps Jehovah's spirit was leading things in a different direction.

00:46:32.789 --> 00:46:42.789
Well, again, what can help us to not be an obstacle to unity, humility, mildness, patience? Just what we're considering in Ephesians chapter 4.

00:46:42.789 --> 00:46:56.789
You see, we have to have the confidence that if it's important to Jehovah, it'll happen. And if not, what a shame it would be if we become an obstacle to unity over something that's not that important to Jehovah.

00:46:57.789 --> 00:47:04.789
You see, brothers and sisters, we need the Gideons to help us in our support of the governing body.

00:47:04.789 --> 00:47:13.789
Gideon was such a beautiful example. Once he understood Jehovah's direction, he was willing to run into the fire for Jehovah and for his organization.

00:47:13.789 --> 00:47:18.789
That's what we need. We need Gideons. We don't need any more Ephremites.

00:47:19.789 --> 00:47:29.789
So in harmony with today's text, may each one of us walk worthily in these last days, work on the qualities of humility, mildness, and patience.

00:47:29.789 --> 00:47:42.099
And if we do, we will be a uniting force for good and of Gideon-like value to Jehovah and the organization in the troublesome days ahead.

00:47:42.099 --> 00:47:49.099
When we're humble and add to the peace of the congregation, we make Jehovah happy.

00:47:49.099 --> 00:47:55.099
As Jehovah's Witnesses, we cherish our privilege to share the good news with others.

00:47:55.099 --> 00:47:59.099
What can help us be adaptable in our ministry?

00:47:59.099 --> 00:48:06.099
Please enjoy the latest installment of Iron Shopping's Iron.

00:48:06.099 --> 00:48:12.099
Hi, I am Michalis, and this is Iron Shopping's Iron.

00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:34.260
One challenge that often makes me nervous is when I've prepared an introduction, I've planned the conversation, but the householder doesn't follow the plan, and I have to adapt.

00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:42.260
Have you ever had that experience? This could mean that what we prepared just won't work.

00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:52.260
So we're going to discuss four tips that have helped me, and hopefully will help you be more adaptable.

00:48:52.260 --> 00:49:11.260
The four tips are, one, know your territory, two, make use of the teaching toolbox, three, anticipate common objections or questions, and four,

00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:16.260
be flexible, adjust to the householder's needs.

00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:23.260
Because remember, this is meant to be a conversation, not a sermon, or a sales pitch.

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:30.860
Now, let's look at a situation where applying these four suggestions can help.

00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:39.110
So, what introduction are you using?

00:49:39.110 --> 00:49:42.110
I thought I would talk about economic problems.

00:49:42.110 --> 00:49:45.110
Hmm, good idea, and it really suits the territory.

00:49:45.110 --> 00:49:46.110
Thanks.

00:49:46.110 --> 00:49:51.110
I'll read Isaiah 65-21-23, and then offer the kingdom tract.

00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:54.110
Perfect. I'll get the scripture ready.

00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:55.110
Excellent.

00:49:55.110 --> 00:50:08.119
Good morning.

00:50:08.119 --> 00:50:12.119
Many people in our area struggle to make ends meet.

00:50:12.119 --> 00:50:16.119
Do you think there will ever be a time when we won't have to stress about money?

00:50:16.119 --> 00:50:22.119
Actually, now isn't a good time. I just received some bad news.

00:50:22.119 --> 00:50:24.119
I'm sorry.

00:50:24.119 --> 00:50:26.119
We'll come back another time then.

00:50:26.119 --> 00:50:27.119
Thank you.

00:50:27.119 --> 00:50:38.690
Okay. Our sister applied our first two tips really well.

00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:42.690
But our sisters are usually excellent when it comes to the ministry.

00:50:42.690 --> 00:50:45.690
So, no real surprises there.

00:50:45.690 --> 00:50:46.690
Did you notice?

00:50:46.690 --> 00:50:55.690
First, she knew her territory well and had a presentation designed specifically for it.

00:50:55.690 --> 00:51:00.690
Second, her scripture and talking point were taken from the tract

00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:03.690
what is the kingdom of God?

00:51:03.690 --> 00:51:07.690
Which, as you know, is part of our teaching toolbox.

00:51:07.690 --> 00:51:11.690
However, when the householder had something else on her mind,

00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:15.690
our sister opted to return later.

00:51:15.690 --> 00:51:19.690
That could be a good decision in this kind of situation.

00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:25.690
But let's see what would happen if she were to ask just one more question

00:51:25.690 --> 00:51:29.690
and adapt according to the householder's response.

00:51:29.690 --> 00:51:34.670
Actually, now isn't a good time.

00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:37.670
I just received some bad news.

00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:41.670
I'm sorry. Is there anything we can do to help?

00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:43.670
No.

00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:48.670
I just heard my sister's cancer.

00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:54.670
Oh, that must be so difficult for your sister and for you.

00:51:54.670 --> 00:51:58.670
Yes, when someone we love is suffering we can often feel helpless.

00:51:58.670 --> 00:52:00.670
That's exactly how I feel.

00:52:00.670 --> 00:52:05.670
If you have a moment, could I show you something that I find comforting

00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:09.670
about a time in the near future when I loved ones will never suffer again?

00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:11.670
Hmm, I'd like that.

00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:17.670
Notice what the Bible says at Revelation 21, verses 3 and 4.

00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:20.670
With that, I heard a loud voice from the Throne saying,

00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:30.809
Wow. Did you see how she was able to offer this woman real comfort

00:52:30.809 --> 00:52:33.809
just by being adaptable?

00:52:33.809 --> 00:52:36.809
All it took was one simple question.

00:52:36.809 --> 00:52:39.809
Is there anything we can do to help?

00:52:39.809 --> 00:52:44.809
She was sincere and friendly and the householder responded.

00:52:44.809 --> 00:52:48.809
At that point, our sister applied our third tip.

00:52:48.809 --> 00:52:54.809
She obviously was familiar with some common anxieties of ones in that territory

00:52:54.809 --> 00:52:59.809
because she smoothly transitioned to the topic of suffering

00:52:59.809 --> 00:53:05.809
which allowed her to listen to the householders' real concern

00:53:05.809 --> 00:53:09.809
and then implement our fourth tip.

00:53:09.809 --> 00:53:12.809
She adjusted to meet those needs.

00:53:12.809 --> 00:53:16.809
Plus, she didn't struggle to find information to use.

00:53:16.809 --> 00:53:20.809
She stayed right there in her teaching toolbox.

00:53:20.809 --> 00:53:25.809
Granted, not every situation will be as straightforward as this.

00:53:25.809 --> 00:53:31.809
And it takes time and experience to get comfortable moving from one topic to another.

00:53:31.809 --> 00:53:34.809
But if we apply our four tips,

00:53:34.809 --> 00:53:37.809
know your territory.

00:53:37.809 --> 00:53:40.809
Make use of the teaching toolbox.

00:53:40.809 --> 00:53:44.809
Try to anticipate common objections or questions

00:53:44.809 --> 00:53:48.809
and then adjust to the householder's needs.

00:53:48.809 --> 00:53:54.809
By applying these, we'll find very quickly that we're having meaningful conversations

00:53:54.809 --> 00:54:00.809
and are able to share targeted truths with those most in need.

00:54:00.809 --> 00:54:08.179
As always, these are just a few techniques that have worked for me

00:54:08.179 --> 00:54:11.179
and I hope they work for you.

00:54:11.179 --> 00:54:15.179
Remember, part of the beauty of our ministry

00:54:15.179 --> 00:54:21.429
is that we continue to sharpen one another.

00:54:21.429 --> 00:54:23.429
What good suggestions?

00:54:23.429 --> 00:54:31.429
In this example, the sister was able to start a conversation with a simple, good morning.

00:54:31.429 --> 00:54:35.429
Of course, in real life, the way you greet people in your territory

00:54:35.429 --> 00:54:38.429
might be different than what we saw in the video.

00:54:38.429 --> 00:54:44.809
We hope you've enjoyed this month's theme, Make Wise Decisions.

00:54:44.809 --> 00:54:49.809
Before we conclude, we'd like to introduce you to our brothers and sisters

00:54:49.809 --> 00:54:53.809
living on a land rich in Bible history.

00:54:53.809 --> 00:54:55.809
Greece.

00:54:55.809 --> 00:55:01.809
Greece is a mountainous country located at the southernmost part of the Balkan Peninsula

00:55:01.809 --> 00:55:05.809
with a rugged and diverse landscape.

00:55:05.809 --> 00:55:09.809
It also includes more than 2,000 islands.

00:55:09.809 --> 00:55:13.809
And with one of the longest coastlines in all of Europe,

00:55:13.809 --> 00:55:18.809
this is a land of beautiful beaches and sheltered coves.

00:55:19.809 --> 00:55:24.809
Greece is known for its classic Mediterranean cuisine and delicacies

00:55:24.809 --> 00:55:29.809
like Musica, made from eggplant and Domadakia,

00:55:29.809 --> 00:55:34.809
stuffed grape leaves, usually filled with rice and herbs.

00:55:34.809 --> 00:55:39.809
A less familiar part of Greek diet is mass Tiahil,

00:55:39.809 --> 00:55:46.809
or Mastic Gum, which is made from the sap of a tree grown only on the small island of Heos.

00:55:47.809 --> 00:55:51.809
In ancient times, people chewed Mastic to freshen their breath.

00:55:51.809 --> 00:55:54.809
It was an early version of chewing gum.

00:55:54.809 --> 00:56:01.809
Today, it's typically used to flavor everything from bread to ice cream.

00:56:01.809 --> 00:56:06.809
The preaching of the good news in Greece goes all the way back to the first century

00:56:06.809 --> 00:56:10.809
when the Apostle Paul first stepped over into Macedonia.

00:56:10.809 --> 00:56:13.809
He landed in the seaport town of Neapoli,

00:56:13.809 --> 00:56:16.809
known today as the city of Cavala.

00:56:16.809 --> 00:56:21.809
And the preaching in Cavala is still going strong

00:56:21.809 --> 00:56:26.809
with four congregations busy with public witnessing throughout the city,

00:56:26.809 --> 00:56:30.809
including at the harbor and at rest areas.

00:56:30.809 --> 00:56:33.809
Cavala's old city is built on a hill

00:56:33.809 --> 00:56:37.809
where brothers and sisters often climb many steep steps

00:56:37.809 --> 00:56:40.809
to reach the homes in their territory.

00:56:41.809 --> 00:56:47.809
The branch office in Greece oversees the activity of more than 30,000 publishers,

00:56:47.809 --> 00:56:53.809
including 2,900 on the neighboring island Nation of Cyprus.

00:56:53.809 --> 00:56:58.809
They preach to a population of about 11 million people,

00:56:58.809 --> 00:57:03.809
often in some of the very same cities where Paul preached in the first century,

00:57:03.809 --> 00:57:08.809
including Thessalonica or modern-day Thessaloniki,

00:57:08.809 --> 00:57:13.809
Berea or Berea and the capital city of Athens.

00:57:13.809 --> 00:57:16.809
We'll end our visit to Greece back in Macedonia,

00:57:16.809 --> 00:57:21.809
where our Greek brothers and sisters send their warmest greetings

00:57:21.809 --> 00:57:24.809
from the assembly hall in Thessaloniki.

00:57:24.809 --> 00:57:28.809
From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:57:28.809 --> 00:57:31.809
this is JW Broadcasting.
