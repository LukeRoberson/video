00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:10.099
We thought that this might be some kind of pushing between the empires, but something

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:13.599
else happened, the worst case scenario.

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:20.100
We were aware of the fact that we had to prepare for some serious changes.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.899
There were thousands of people at the border.

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:28.100
People had to wait in long queues, several kilometers long.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:34.500
But every day we received 200 or more refugees, our brothers and sisters who were seeking

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.859
refuge in Poland.

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:42.460
It was really touching since most of them had only one bag.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.780
It was not possible to take more.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.460
The brothers of the coordinators, the committee of the governing body were analyzing with us

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.539
about how to help and what we could do.

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.259
Immediately, the first disaster relief committee was set up.

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:09.099
And when we realized that there was already a need in the whole of Poland, 16 committees

00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:12.019
started their work.

00:01:12.019 --> 00:01:18.859
The number of DC-50 applications of those who wanted to volunteer increased every week

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:27.099
by thousands, indicating that the willingness and readiness to help was huge.

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:32.019
We prepared everything in order to be able to welcome refugees at the border crossings,

00:01:32.019 --> 00:01:37.060
at the reception point set up by the authorities on Ukrainian border, and at other locations

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.140
where the trains from Ukraine were arriving.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.659
We knew we would have to ask the congregations for accommodations.

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:53.140
At the beginning, we prepared a survey that helped us organize everything.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.900
We know that it's thanks to Jehovah's backing.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:04.700
Because in just a few days, we received more than 7,500 replies.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:15.009
For assembly halls and 22 kingdom halls were temporarily converted to refugee relief centers.

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:20.889
The brothers were traveling for days and needed some basic things, hygienic products,

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:24.330
diapers for children, and many other things.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.969
Not only clothes, but many basic necessities.

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:29.289
They received food.

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:34.650
They could warm up, take a shower, and get some rest.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:41.289
In addition to this, in many places volunteers prepared rooms for donated garments, where

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:45.009
brothers and sisters could choose clothing.

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:53.530
In some places, brothers prepared special areas for children, where there were toys, crayons,

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:00.449
something to draw on, something to play with, so that the children could feel busy there.

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:07.900
Doing something helped them to get their minds off what they saw when they were fleeing.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.340
The children expressed their gratitude in their pictures.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.580
Almost everywhere, they wrote,

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.219
Thank you, thank you.

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:23.340
They drew pictures of paradise, expressions of their hope.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.389
It was so touching.

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:33.469
The circuit overseers, together with the elders, did something absolutely spectacular.

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:39.229
In the beginning, some of these brothers made hundreds of shepherding calls in two or three

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:45.259
weeks.

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:49.500
The goal was to deliver 40,000 humanitarian aid boxes.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:57.060
We were responsible for purchasing food, hygiene products, some first aid items, medical supplies.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.099
We had to find a logistical location where we could store all of this.

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:08.500
Afterward, we had to think about how to pack it, how to deliver it to the border, and then

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.060
how to transport it to Ukraine, where at this very moment, the war continued.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.459
It was very nice to observe the volunteers who came to help us pack up the supplies.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.540
When the brothers from all over the country got to know about the need, they were ready

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:32.779
to drive 300 or more kilometers from many hours to devote a couple of hours to packing boxes.

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:38.540
As it turned out later on, it was more or less 190 tons of supplies.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.500
In each package, we also put some drawings made by children.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:49.889
It was an expression of love in those humanitarian aid boxes.

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:56.209
Having this opportunity to help the brothers, we saw an expression of Jehovah's love and

00:04:56.209 --> 00:05:00.410
might in all these efforts.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:07.610
Only Jehovah could prepare his people for such a well-organized and effective activity.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.649
Many of the brothers have commented that the fact that they see so much being done to

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:17.889
help the brothers in Ukraine right now convinces them that if they're in that situation in

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:21.089
the future, if they're sometime when they need that love or they

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:26.970
need that help, well, Jehovah's organization is going to be there to help them as well.

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:35.290
Belonging to Jehovah's household, being part of a worldwide family is priceless.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:44.170
The hatred in the world continues to grow constantly and there's just more conflict and disunity.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:51.170
At the same time, the unity and the love of Jehovah's people just keeps on increasing

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:53.610
and it just becomes more and more powerful.
