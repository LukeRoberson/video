00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:05.139
Welcome to JW Broadcasting.

00:00:05.139 --> 00:00:08.140
Since all of us experience trials,

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.140
you'll appreciate this month's program,

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.140
which focuses on the topic of comfort.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:21.140
We'll learn how comfort can bring joy to the giver and the receiver.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.140
Caregivers provide constant comfort,

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.140
but who comforts them?

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.140
Damian and Carolina share how the Bible and loving friends

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.140
help them continue caring for their loved ones.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.140
As we dig for treasures in the book of Joel,

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.140
we'll examine the power of endurance during times of trial.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.140
And our music video highlights the importance of expressing gratitude

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.140
to those we care about.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.140
This is JW Broadcasting.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:22.019
Our theme Scripture is 2 Corinthians chapter 1, verses 3 and 4.

00:01:22.019 --> 00:01:26.019
Praise be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:31.019
the Father of tender mercies, and the God of all comfort,

00:01:31.019 --> 00:01:37.019
who comforts us in all our trials so that we may be able to comfort others

00:01:37.019 --> 00:01:43.019
in any sort of trial with the comfort that we receive from God.

00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:49.019
From the time we were born, all of us have been in need of comfort.

00:01:49.019 --> 00:01:53.019
You don't remember the first time you cried because you were hungry,

00:01:53.019 --> 00:01:56.019
uncomfortable or needing to be held,

00:01:56.019 --> 00:02:00.019
but you probably do remember the last time you needed comfort,

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:05.019
and no doubt many of us are in need of comfort right now.

00:02:05.019 --> 00:02:07.019
This is understandable.

00:02:07.019 --> 00:02:12.020
Psalm 90 verse 10 poetically describes our life as imperfect humans

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:19.020
by stating the span of our life is 70 years or 80 if one is especially strong,

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.020
but they are filled with trouble and sorrow.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.020
They quickly pass by and away we fly.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.020
Many different situations can cause us trouble and sorrow,

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.020
disappointment or pain.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:41.020
Some of them are what we might call common because every imperfect human has to deal with them,

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:48.020
getting sick, growing old and grieving the death of a loved one.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:55.020
Other reasons for distress could be called circumstantial, accidents, economic problems,

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.020
the breakup of a marriage, natural disasters,

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:06.020
becoming a victim of abuse or other crimes, civil unrest and war.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.020
In addition, we may need comfort related to our worship,

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:17.020
living in a divided household, experiencing persecution or imprisonment,

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.020
facing ridicule in school or at the workplace,

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:28.020
or perhaps a family member or a close friend leaves Jehovah.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:34.020
Repentant wrongdoers also need comfort when they return to the congregation.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:41.020
Whether the cause of our distress is common, circumstantial or because of our worship,

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:47.020
all of us are in need of comfort and the problem is worldwide.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:53.020
Verse Peter 5.9 tells us that the same kind of sufferings are being experienced

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:58.020
by the entire association of your brothers in the world.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:05.020
However, we can find comfort from the one who is revealed in verses 6 and 7,

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:11.020
where it directs, humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:18.019
so that he may exalt you in due time while you throw all your anxiety on him

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.019
because he cares for you.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.019
Jehovah has always been the ultimate source of true comfort.

00:04:25.019 --> 00:04:32.019
Moses was convinced that Jehovah would support and comfort him no matter what situation he faced.

00:04:32.019 --> 00:04:38.019
With confidence, he wrote what we find at Deuteronomy 3327.

00:04:38.019 --> 00:04:46.019
God is a refuge from ancient times. His everlasting arms are beneath you.

00:04:46.019 --> 00:04:53.019
When we're down and struggling to get up, Jehovah will put his arms beneath us.

00:04:53.019 --> 00:04:59.019
Gently lift us up and help us to get back on our feet.

00:04:59.019 --> 00:05:05.019
The Psalms repeatedly express appreciation for Jehovah's tender care and comfort.

00:05:05.019 --> 00:05:12.019
For example, the writer of Psalm 9419 voiced his gratitude to Jehovah by saying,

00:05:13.019 --> 00:05:22.019
When anxieties overwhelmed me, you comforted and soothed me as Romans 154 confirms.

00:05:22.019 --> 00:05:26.019
All the things that were written beforehand were written for our instruction,

00:05:26.019 --> 00:05:34.019
so that through our endurance and through the comfort from the scriptures, we might have hope.

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:41.019
No matter what's causing us distress, we can find scriptures that bring us comfort.

00:05:41.019 --> 00:05:46.019
The book Scriptures for Christian Living includes the heading comfort,

00:05:46.019 --> 00:05:49.019
which discusses many causes of discouragement.

00:05:49.019 --> 00:05:54.019
Not only does it direct us to scriptures that confirm Jehovah's loving care,

00:05:54.019 --> 00:06:00.019
but it also gives examples of Bible characters who suffered these hardships

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:04.259
and how Jehovah helped them.

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:10.259
One of the best ways to receive comfort from Jehovah is to ask him for it.

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:18.259
In other words of Psalm 145, King David praised Jehovah for the way he answers prayers.

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:22.259
Let's read verses 18 and 19.

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:27.259
David wrote, Jehovah is near to all those calling on him.

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:34.259
To all who call on him in truth, he satisfies the desire of those who fear him.

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:39.259
He hears their cry for help, and he rescues them.

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:44.259
Just as a loving parent patiently responds to his child's cheerful cries,

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:51.259
Jehovah turns his compassionate ear to our pleas for help.

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:58.259
As described in 1 Samuel 1 and 2, the Israelite woman Hannah was so distraught

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:04.259
and extremely bitter over not having any children that she couldn't eat.

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:12.259
When she approached Jehovah at the tabernacle, she began to pray and to weep uncontrollably.

00:07:12.259 --> 00:07:17.259
Jehovah listened to and acted on this humble woman's prayer.

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:24.259
After that, Hannah went on her way and ate, and her face was no longer downcast.

00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:33.800
Similarly, Jehovah will comfort us when we pour out our concerns in heartfelt prayer.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:42.800
In view of all that the Bible has to say about comfort, we're not surprised when we read the words of 2 Corinthians 1, 3 and 4.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.800
Please open to this theme text for our discussion.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:52.800
As we read it again, reflect on how these words can help us to comfort others

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:58.800
while we ourselves cope with the stressful conditions of these critical times.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.800
2 Corinthians 1, 3 and 4 reads,

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:07.800
Praise to be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:12.800
the Father of tender mercies, and the God of all comfort,

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:21.800
who comforts us in all our trials so that we may be able to comfort others in any sort of trial

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.800
with the comfort that we receive from God.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:33.799
The expression tender mercies comes from a word that's used to convey sorrow at the suffering of another.

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:40.799
It describes Jehovah's tender feelings for his faithful servants who are in distress.

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:46.799
Paul goes on to say that Jehovah is the God of all comfort,

00:08:46.799 --> 00:08:51.799
so all comfort originates with Jehovah.

00:08:51.799 --> 00:08:56.799
Verse 4 identifies a special way that Jehovah gives comfort,

00:08:56.799 --> 00:09:00.799
and that's through our brothers and sisters.

00:09:00.799 --> 00:09:07.799
Let's read it again. It says that Jehovah comforts us in all our trials

00:09:07.799 --> 00:09:17.799
so that we may be able to comfort others in any sort of trial with the comfort that we receive from Him.

00:09:17.799 --> 00:09:25.799
Did you notice the connection between our receiving comfort and becoming equipped to comfort others?

00:09:25.799 --> 00:09:30.799
Jehovah comforts us, and as humans created in God's image,

00:09:30.799 --> 00:09:36.799
we are moved by His Holy Spirit to share that comfort with others.

00:09:36.799 --> 00:09:41.799
Therefore, Christians are not divided into two groups,

00:09:41.799 --> 00:09:45.799
those who give comfort and those who receive it.

00:09:45.799 --> 00:09:54.799
No, we all are obligated to give comfort even though we ourselves are in need of comfort.

00:09:54.799 --> 00:09:56.799
How can we do this?

00:09:56.799 --> 00:09:58.799
Consider the Apostle Paul.

00:09:58.799 --> 00:10:01.799
During his first imprisonment in Rome,

00:10:01.799 --> 00:10:08.799
Paul expressed appreciation for many brothers who became a source of great comfort to Him.

00:10:08.799 --> 00:10:13.799
In Colossians 4, he mentioned some of them by name.

00:10:13.799 --> 00:10:18.799
Aristarchus, Ticacus, and Mark.

00:10:18.799 --> 00:10:23.799
We'll hear more about these three men in a later part of the broadcast.

00:10:23.799 --> 00:10:27.799
Paul was grateful for the efforts his brothers made to visit Him

00:10:27.799 --> 00:10:32.799
and to comfort Him by their words and practical assistance.

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:36.799
But for Paul, it wasn't all about receiving.

00:10:36.799 --> 00:10:41.799
He used his time while in prison to build up those who came to see Him

00:10:41.799 --> 00:10:45.799
and to write letters of encouragement to the congregations.

00:10:45.799 --> 00:10:49.799
A sister in South Africa, by the name of Claudine,

00:10:49.799 --> 00:10:54.799
imitated Paul's example after she underwent major surgery.

00:10:54.799 --> 00:11:00.799
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, she couldn't receive visitors.

00:11:00.799 --> 00:11:04.799
But Claudine was determined not to feel sorry for herself

00:11:04.799 --> 00:11:09.799
and she asked God to give her the strength to comfort others.

00:11:09.799 --> 00:11:14.799
Claudine contacted a woman who had studied the Bible in the past.

00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:18.799
The woman resumed her study and attended meetings by video conference.

00:11:18.799 --> 00:11:22.799
Next, Claudine started a study with the woman's younger sister,

00:11:22.799 --> 00:11:27.799
who gave her the names of four other women who wanted to study.

00:11:27.799 --> 00:11:32.799
By her determination to comfort others while coping with her own illness,

00:11:32.799 --> 00:11:37.799
Claudine started studies with a total of sixteen women.

00:11:37.799 --> 00:11:43.269
At times, those who are distressed and in need of comfort

00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:46.269
may be reluctant to accept help.

00:11:46.269 --> 00:11:50.269
For example, after Moses related God's promise to deliver his people

00:11:50.269 --> 00:11:55.269
from Egyptian bondage, the Israelites at first did not listen to Moses

00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:58.269
because of their discouragement.

00:11:58.269 --> 00:12:01.269
Later, they did pay attention.

00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:04.269
Naomi, whose name means my pleasantness,

00:12:04.269 --> 00:12:08.269
was living in a foreign land because of a famine in Israel.

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:13.269
She was widowed and was grieving the death of her two sons.

00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:18.269
When she was able to return to Israel, the woman of Bethlehem greeted her saying,

00:12:18.269 --> 00:12:21.269
is this Naomi?

00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:25.269
Feeling that Jehovah was responsible for her bitterness,

00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:28.269
she replied with the sorrowful words,

00:12:28.269 --> 00:12:32.269
to not call me Naomi, call me Mera,

00:12:32.269 --> 00:12:36.269
for the Almighty has made life very bitter for me.

00:12:36.269 --> 00:12:41.269
However, Naomi soon drew closer to God's people

00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:43.269
and accepted loving help.

00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:47.269
Her bitterness was replaced with joy.

00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:52.269
If you're suffering, try to resist the natural inclination to withdraw

00:12:52.269 --> 00:12:55.269
and to avoid contact with others.

00:12:56.269 --> 00:12:58.269
This will be a challenge,

00:12:58.269 --> 00:13:02.269
but experience has shown that making the effort to be with others

00:13:02.269 --> 00:13:07.269
opens the door to receiving the comfort Jehovah provides

00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:13.269
through the compassionate words and actions of our brothers and sisters.

00:13:13.269 --> 00:13:17.269
The comfort Jehovah provides when we endure tribulation

00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:21.269
can train us to be more sensitive to the needs of others,

00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:25.269
and that's the first step to giving comfort,

00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:31.269
being attentive and observant to identify those in need of comfort.

00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:35.269
In many cases, the need is obvious.

00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:39.269
Our brother met with an accident or has lost his job

00:13:39.269 --> 00:13:43.269
or a close friend or a family member has died.

00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:47.269
For some, the need may not be so obvious.

00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:50.269
We may notice a change in behavior

00:13:50.269 --> 00:13:55.269
or their facial expression may tell us that something is troubling them.

00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:57.269
We don't want to pry,

00:13:57.269 --> 00:14:02.269
but we can kindly approach them and gently draw them out.

00:14:02.269 --> 00:14:05.269
They may need time before they feel comfortable opening up

00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:10.269
about their feelings, so we want to be patient.

00:14:10.269 --> 00:14:17.269
The second step to giving comfort is pray to determine what we can do.

00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:22.269
There may be little or nothing we can do to eliminate the cause of their distress.

00:14:22.269 --> 00:14:26.269
For example, a long-time missionary who lost his wife said,

00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:29.269
I don't want to get over it.

00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:32.269
I just want to learn to cope.

00:14:32.269 --> 00:14:38.269
The important thing for us to do is to apply the words of Proverbs 327.

00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:42.269
Do not withhold good from those to whom you should give it

00:14:42.269 --> 00:14:46.269
if it is within your power to help.

00:14:46.269 --> 00:14:51.269
We may feel awkward, not knowing what to say or do.

00:14:51.269 --> 00:14:55.269
If so, reflect on the meaning of the Greek word

00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:58.269
often rendered comfort in the Bible.

00:14:58.269 --> 00:15:02.269
It literally means a calling to one side.

00:15:02.269 --> 00:15:06.269
In other words, take the third step.

00:15:06.269 --> 00:15:09.269
Make yourself available.

00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:12.269
Don't feel that you have to give a speech.

00:15:12.269 --> 00:15:15.269
Our brother or sister needs to know that someone cares

00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:19.269
and our very presence can be comforting.

00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:22.269
It could be that he just wants someone to talk to.

00:15:22.269 --> 00:15:26.269
If so, be a good listener.

00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:30.269
If you read scriptures together, emphasize that the words reflect

00:15:30.269 --> 00:15:34.269
how Jehovah feels about his suffering.

00:15:34.269 --> 00:15:37.269
It's not so much what you say or do.

00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:41.269
What counts is that you acknowledge his suffering

00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:44.269
and show heartfelt compassion.

00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:47.269
For example, a sister serving at World Headquarters

00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:51.269
lost her mother and father during the pandemic.

00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:54.269
After spending a long day of hospice with her mother,

00:15:54.269 --> 00:15:58.269
she returned home to discover a huge fruit basket

00:15:58.269 --> 00:16:01.269
delivered by her fellow workers at Bethel.

00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:03.269
She commented,

00:16:03.269 --> 00:16:07.269
it wasn't the fruit itself which I had eaten many times before,

00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:11.269
or the way it was so beautifully decorated.

00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:16.269
But it was the thoughtfulness and love behind the gesture

00:16:16.269 --> 00:16:20.269
that made my heart swell at one of the most difficult times

00:16:20.269 --> 00:16:23.269
in my life.

00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:26.269
When a devastating earthquake in tsunami struck Eastern Japan

00:16:26.269 --> 00:16:30.269
in March 2011, brothers in Japan and other countries

00:16:30.269 --> 00:16:33.269
responded immediately.

00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:35.269
Two and a half years later, my wife and I

00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:40.269
made a personal visit to several congregations in that area.

00:16:40.269 --> 00:16:44.269
Brothers in Nepal had sent messages of comfort to one congregation.

00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:47.269
Brothers in another congregation showed us a board

00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:51.269
with many similar notes written in languages of the Philippines.

00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:52.269
Brothers commented,

00:16:52.269 --> 00:16:54.269
we can't read the notes,

00:16:54.269 --> 00:16:57.269
but we know what they say.

00:16:57.269 --> 00:17:00.269
What great comfort those short messages

00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:03.269
brought to our Japanese brothers.

00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:04.269
While we were there,

00:17:04.269 --> 00:17:09.269
Super Typhoon Haiyan was ravaging the Philippine Islands,

00:17:09.269 --> 00:17:12.269
referring to the typhoon the Japanese brothers said,

00:17:12.269 --> 00:17:18.269
now it's our turn to comfort our brothers in the Philippines.

00:17:18.269 --> 00:17:22.269
As this world sinks ever deeper into these critical last days,

00:17:22.269 --> 00:17:26.269
our need for comfort will only increase.

00:17:26.269 --> 00:17:31.269
How grateful we are that Jehovah is the father of tender mercies

00:17:31.269 --> 00:17:34.269
and the God of all comfort.

00:17:34.269 --> 00:17:38.269
He has generously given us the gift of prayer,

00:17:38.269 --> 00:17:41.269
abundant words of comfort in the Bible,

00:17:41.269 --> 00:17:45.269
and a compassionate worldwide brotherhood.

00:17:45.269 --> 00:17:49.269
As we benefit from these loving provisions,

00:17:49.269 --> 00:17:53.269
may we be alert to recognize others who need comfort,

00:17:53.269 --> 00:17:57.269
determine what practical help we can offer,

00:17:57.269 --> 00:18:00.269
and take steps to comfort others

00:18:00.269 --> 00:18:04.269
while we cope during these critical times.

00:18:04.269 --> 00:18:07.269
Can you think of someone who might need comfort?

00:18:08.269 --> 00:18:11.269
Focusing on the blessings that come from helping someone

00:18:11.269 --> 00:18:14.269
can move us to action.

00:18:14.269 --> 00:18:16.269
When we comfort others,

00:18:16.269 --> 00:18:20.269
it can have positive and far-reaching effects.

00:18:20.269 --> 00:18:24.269
Let's see how in lessons from the Watchtower.

00:18:24.269 --> 00:18:37.740
When I look at this picture of Aristarchus holding on to Paul,

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:39.740
sticking closer into a challenging time,

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:42.740
it makes me think about how brothers and sisters really help me out

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:45.740
through a difficult situation.

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.740
The whole area was flooded,

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:49.740
including the house in which I was living at that time.

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:52.740
I was waiting through waters which, at the deepest point,

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:54.740
came up to about chest height.

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:56.740
The battery on my phone was completely flat,

00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:01.410
which meant I couldn't contact anybody.

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:05.410
The Watchtower highlighted Ticacus as a trustworthy friend,

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:08.410
and my friends have been very trustworthy,

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:10.410
and without them,

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:12.410
I wouldn't have been able to cope.

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:15.410
My dad suddenly had a massive stroke,

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:20.099
but then my brother,

00:19:20.099 --> 00:19:23.099
he left Rover,

00:19:23.099 --> 00:19:30.220
and then just a few months later, my dad died.

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:32.220
When I was studying this article,

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.220
I could have immediately put names down

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:40.220
for people who helped me like Aristarchus and Ticacus.

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:42.220
But then, as he came down to Mark,

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:45.220
and the practical help that he was able to give,

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:49.220
well, I thought, that's my whole congregation.

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:53.220
In 2016, my wife, Kerry,

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:55.220
she lost her battle with cancer,

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:59.220
and yeah, all of a sudden I was on mute.

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:05.640
Kerry is the best person I ever met.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:09.920
I learned from her that when you let people in,

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.920
you let your home run to.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:18.140
I was waiting through the water,

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:21.140
and I was just thinking if I can just make it

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.140
to the whole of this brother and sister,

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:24.140
it'll be all right.

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.140
I'm sure enough, when I arrived at their home,

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.140
I was welcome inside,

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:29.140
opportunity to get clean,

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:30.140
get warm,

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.140
and enjoy an ice meal.

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:34.140
And just like Aristarchus was willing to make sacrifices,

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:37.140
they offered me to stay in their home for,

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.140
as long as I needed to.

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:42.140
It was clearly inconvenient for me to stay in their home,

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.140
but that inconvenience that it was outweighed

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:46.140
by their genuine desire to help

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.140
and look after me through a difficult time.

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:50.140
As soon as I plugged in my phone,

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:51.140
and it got power,

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:52.140
the phone rang,

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:55.140
and it was the brother that had been my Bible instructor

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:56.140
as a youth,

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:57.140
and it was just checking and making sure

00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:58.140
that I was all right

00:20:58.140 --> 00:20:59.140
and that I got everything that I needed.

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.140
But did it stop there?

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:02.140
In the time that followed,

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.140
my friends continued to reach out to get in touch

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.140
to make sure that I got everything that I needed,

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:08.140
they even continued to evacuate me around for me.

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:10.140
It was just to make sure that I could move on

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:12.140
from what I'd take in place.

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:14.140
A good place for anyone.

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:17.140
She invited me for hot chocolate,

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:20.140
and then she just asking how I was getting out,

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:23.140
I said I was really struggling to sleep,

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:26.140
and she very kindly showed me her journal.

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:28.140
I thought it was such a great idea,

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:29.140
and I found it really helped.

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.140
I would always have five things

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:33.140
that I could say thank you to Jehovah for.

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:35.140
My husband League is an amazing listener,

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:39.140
just listening to whatever I was feeling at that time,

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:42.140
even if it was a bit wild.

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:45.140
Do other brothers and sisters

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:47.140
that also were very patient with me,

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.140
and I would repeat myself over and over again.

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:53.140
They didn't mind, they were just happy to listen.

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:55.140
I needed reassurance,

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:59.140
because I didn't feel I was coping with my father.

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:02.140
It was like I couldn't believe he passed away

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:04.140
until I'd seen the death certificate,

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:06.140
and it was the same with my brother.

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:13.609
It wouldn't be real until I heard the announcement,

00:22:13.609 --> 00:22:16.609
and I thought that's kind of sound very strange,

00:22:16.609 --> 00:22:18.609
but I shared that with my friend,

00:22:18.609 --> 00:22:21.609
you know, that's fine, it's okay.

00:22:21.609 --> 00:22:23.609
And that was really reassuring.

00:22:23.609 --> 00:22:29.359
I didn't think I was going crazy.

00:22:29.359 --> 00:22:31.359
When you're faced with something like that,

00:22:31.359 --> 00:22:34.359
normal things become like epic endeavors.

00:22:34.359 --> 00:22:36.359
Things that you might have looked forward to,

00:22:36.359 --> 00:22:39.359
suddenly take on a level of anxiety.

00:22:39.359 --> 00:22:41.359
Some friends of mine, they were like,

00:22:41.359 --> 00:22:42.359
okay, get into the meetings,

00:22:42.359 --> 00:22:44.359
that's not even a thing now.

00:22:44.359 --> 00:22:45.359
You can just come with us.

00:22:45.359 --> 00:22:48.359
Then I'm going to the meeting with two people,

00:22:48.359 --> 00:22:49.359
rather than going on my own.

00:22:49.359 --> 00:22:50.359
That was super helpful.

00:22:51.359 --> 00:22:53.359
Two sisters took it upon themselves,

00:22:53.359 --> 00:22:55.359
to I am my shit.

00:22:55.359 --> 00:22:57.359
I could, I could I had shit,

00:22:57.359 --> 00:23:01.359
but that was such a help, you know?

00:23:01.359 --> 00:23:04.359
I'd like to tell my friends just how much

00:23:04.359 --> 00:23:06.359
all their support has meant.

00:23:06.359 --> 00:23:09.359
Not only does it help you get through a difficult period,

00:23:09.359 --> 00:23:11.359
but that love, that care,

00:23:11.359 --> 00:23:13.359
that loyalty of sticking with you,

00:23:13.359 --> 00:23:16.359
it helps you keep stabilising your whole of service.

00:23:16.359 --> 00:23:18.359
Naturally, you can think well,

00:23:18.359 --> 00:23:20.359
I don't really know what to say.

00:23:20.359 --> 00:23:24.359
I don't think I can do anything to change this,

00:23:24.359 --> 00:23:25.359
but it's not true.

00:23:25.359 --> 00:23:27.359
Just the smallest little thing

00:23:27.359 --> 00:23:29.359
made such a big difference.

00:23:29.359 --> 00:23:31.359
And the things that I'll never forget.

00:23:31.359 --> 00:23:34.359
The brothers and sisters out of their thoughtfulness

00:23:34.359 --> 00:23:36.359
and out of their own creativity,

00:23:36.359 --> 00:23:38.359
they are able to provide,

00:23:38.359 --> 00:23:40.359
just what you need, just when you need it.

00:23:40.359 --> 00:23:42.359
It was the most difficult thing

00:23:42.359 --> 00:23:44.359
that I have ever had to deal with.

00:23:44.359 --> 00:23:47.359
But it was also the most faith-strickening thing

00:23:47.359 --> 00:23:49.359
I've ever been through as well.

00:23:49.359 --> 00:24:03.619
Aristarchus, Ticacus,

00:24:03.619 --> 00:24:06.619
and Mark are just a few examples in the Bible

00:24:06.619 --> 00:24:09.619
of those who provided comfort.

00:24:09.619 --> 00:24:11.619
For a personal study project,

00:24:11.619 --> 00:24:14.619
why not learn about others who did the same,

00:24:14.619 --> 00:24:17.619
such as Barnabas or Onosiferus,

00:24:17.619 --> 00:24:19.619
and how you can imitate them?

00:24:19.619 --> 00:24:25.119
Every day, patient visitation groups

00:24:25.119 --> 00:24:27.119
around the world,

00:24:27.119 --> 00:24:30.119
provide comfort to brothers and sisters in the hospital.

00:24:30.119 --> 00:24:35.119
Let's see how they strengthen those facing serious health issues.

00:24:35.119 --> 00:24:57.759
I would ask Jehovah,

00:24:57.759 --> 00:25:00.759
how am I going to be able to encourage my uncle

00:25:00.759 --> 00:25:11.240
when I myself need encouragement?

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.240
The doctor said,

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.240
this is your lung.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.240
See this mass here?

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:22.589
You have lung cancer.

00:25:22.589 --> 00:25:34.859
There's a feeling of helplessness

00:25:34.859 --> 00:25:36.859
when someone you rely on falls ill.

00:25:36.859 --> 00:25:40.859
And they're so little you can do to help her comfort them.

00:25:40.859 --> 00:25:53.150
PVG stands for Patient Visitation Group.

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:55.150
It's a group made up of elders,

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:58.150
organized to visit our hospitalized brothers and sisters.

00:25:58.150 --> 00:26:01.150
It's a form of shepherding.

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:03.150
We offer practical help,

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:06.150
but the focus is on providing spiritual support.

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:08.150
Assuring those friends that Jehovah sees them,

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:11.150
and that they had the support of both the congregation

00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:13.150
and Jehovah's Holy Spirit.

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:15.150
The first time I was hospitalized,

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:18.150
I don't think I'd even been in there for 24 hours

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:19.150
before they started visiting me,

00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:21.150
even though they didn't know me.

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:23.150
They didn't know who this route was.

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:26.150
When elders from the publisher's own congregation

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:28.150
participate in these PVG visits,

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:30.150
it's invaluable.

00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:33.150
Seeing someone they know can provide a lot of comfort

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:39.859
for that brother and sister who needs it.

00:26:39.859 --> 00:26:42.859
The first step is to listen and let that brother and sister

00:26:42.859 --> 00:26:44.859
express themselves freely.

00:26:44.859 --> 00:26:46.859
When we address their spiritual need,

00:26:46.859 --> 00:26:53.289
always using the Bible to offer encouragement.

00:26:53.289 --> 00:26:55.289
My uncle was in need of encouragement.

00:26:55.289 --> 00:26:58.289
And frankly, I was too.

00:26:58.289 --> 00:27:01.289
Just then, two men with big smiles on their faces

00:27:01.289 --> 00:27:03.289
headed our way, and I thought,

00:27:03.289 --> 00:27:05.289
those are doctors.

00:27:05.289 --> 00:27:07.289
There are brothers.

00:27:07.289 --> 00:27:10.289
And they introduced themselves as members of the PVG.

00:27:10.289 --> 00:27:12.289
And we were so moved by that

00:27:12.289 --> 00:27:16.289
because it was exactly what we needed.

00:27:16.289 --> 00:27:18.289
My mom's condition had worsened,

00:27:18.289 --> 00:27:20.289
and I had to head to the hospital.

00:27:20.289 --> 00:27:22.289
We arrived very late around 2 a.m.,

00:27:22.289 --> 00:27:25.289
but still, a brother from PVG was there waiting for us.

00:27:25.289 --> 00:27:27.289
All our needs were lovingly cared for.

00:27:27.289 --> 00:27:29.289
We were even provided with a place to stay.

00:27:29.289 --> 00:27:31.289
After that visit ended,

00:27:31.289 --> 00:27:34.289
I remember seeing those brothers outside the hospital on their way out.

00:27:34.289 --> 00:27:37.289
Even from where I was, serving from afar,

00:27:37.289 --> 00:27:41.289
I could tell that those brothers got so much joy from their assignment.

00:27:41.289 --> 00:27:43.289
And not only them, their wives too.

00:27:43.289 --> 00:27:45.289
Because they could have spent their day differently

00:27:45.289 --> 00:27:47.289
on a walk or relaxing.

00:27:47.289 --> 00:27:50.289
But no, they chose to be here.

00:27:50.289 --> 00:27:54.700
They asked me to read Isaiah 41-10.

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:56.700
But I couldn't get through it.

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:57.700
I just cried.

00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:59.700
So they read it to me.

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.700
And it hits differently

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:04.700
when you hear it as Jehovah speaking to you personally.

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:07.700
Daughter, do not be afraid.

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:10.700
Do not be anxious.

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:13.700
Because I'm here with you.

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:17.700
It was as if Jehovah were saying,

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:19.700
I am here, my daughter.

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:21.700
I'm right here for you.

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:25.700
And I sent these brothers so that they can strengthen and encourage you.

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:28.700
So don't give up.

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:32.700
I never imagined at the moment that I felt the most alone and sad.

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:48.019
Jehovah would provide that visit for me and my uncle.

00:28:48.019 --> 00:28:52.019
May Jehovah continue to bless them and their beautiful work.

00:28:52.019 --> 00:28:55.019
What those brothers did for me made all the difference.

00:28:55.019 --> 00:29:00.480
I felt Jehovah's loving care through these brothers.

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:03.480
That brotherly love was made so real to me.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:06.480
They motivated me to give back.

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:11.480
It allows us to convey a small portion of the immense love Jehovah has for us.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.480
And they're always so grateful for the visit.

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:19.480
Recognizing it as one way Jehovah and his organization care for them.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:22.480
You can see it on their face and from their expressions

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:25.480
that they consider this tender care is coming from Jehovah.

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:30.980
It's so rewarding to be used by Jehovah in this way.

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:35.980
The patient visitation group has experienced the truthfulness of Jesus' words.

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:40.980
There's more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:46.980
However, sometimes even the most giving people need to receive.

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:50.980
Let's see why caregivers need care themselves.

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:55.740
Okay, let's practice bells.

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:57.740
Do you remember the bells?

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:00.740
Should I write them down?

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:01.740
Yeah.

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:04.740
My mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:11.710
I provide for her economically and I'm her caregiver.

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:20.740
This involves preparing her meals, making sure she takes her medication

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:27.460
and making conversation so she keeps her mind active.

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:32.960
All of it can be very overwhelming.

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:35.960
My daughter was born premature at six months.

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:39.960
The areas of the brain that allow her to walk and to speak well,

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:42.960
the motor areas were damaged.

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:49.819
When my wife passed away, it was even harder for me.

00:30:49.819 --> 00:30:56.150
Not a lot of people know all the work that's involved.

00:30:56.150 --> 00:31:03.529
It takes me around two to three hours for us to get ready for the meetings or the ministry.

00:31:03.529 --> 00:31:08.529
Looking after someone 24-7 is extremely exhausting for the caregiver.

00:31:08.529 --> 00:31:12.529
On some days I go to bed and even though I'm exhausted, I can't fall asleep.

00:31:12.529 --> 00:31:16.529
So it can be very easy for frustration to build up.

00:31:16.529 --> 00:31:18.529
And then you just snap.

00:31:18.529 --> 00:31:22.529
Then you judge yourself really harshly for it after.

00:31:22.529 --> 00:31:26.529
And you think, I'm awful. I'm an awful person.

00:31:26.529 --> 00:31:34.220
I've learned that being a caregiver also means taking care of yourself first.

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:39.720
Because you need to be in a good place, both spiritually and physically.

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:46.160
I try to go for walks so that I can have a little bit more strength.

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:52.160
To take care of my relationship with Jehovah, my personal study is very important.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:57.160
I usually do it at night when everything's calm in the house

00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:01.660
and it's not necessary for me to be by her side.

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:04.660
As caregivers, we need to take care of our health.

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:08.660
So what I try to do is have a specific bedtime

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:11.660
and put aside my electronic devices at a certain time.

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:14.660
It's the simple things that sometimes you forget to do.

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:20.549
And as a caregiver, you tend to put yourself last.

00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:24.549
So when I'm tired out, I ask my sister to help me take care of my mom.

00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:31.180
And then I try to do something to enjoy myself.

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:38.180
If I'm able to take care of my mom's needs by myself with what I've got, then that's what I do.

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:42.180
But if my close family can't provide the additional help that we need,

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:47.180
it's really important for me as the caregiver to be able to say I'm tired.

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:49.180
I need help.

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:52.180
I used to feel too embarrassed to ask for help.

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:59.180
But then I realized that was actually preventing blessings that Jehovah wanted to give us.

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:02.180
For example, the other day we were writing letters

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:06.180
and I could see the love that the brothers and sisters have for my daughter.

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:09.180
When we go out in service, sometimes they say,

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:13.180
take a break, Damien. We'll take her today.

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:18.180
I feel comforted when the brothers and sisters are so interested in us.

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:22.180
Recently, as sister came by the house, I invited her to come in and she said,

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:24.180
no, I'm just stopping by.

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:27.180
I was thinking of you both and I wanted to bring you this.

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:29.180
It was a bag with some bread.

00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:31.180
You'd think, it's just bread.

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:35.180
No. It's not just bread.

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:38.180
It's a sister's time, her money.

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:43.579
But mostly, it's her interest, her love.

00:33:43.579 --> 00:33:48.579
For me, the benefit of having a close friend is being able to say to them,

00:33:48.579 --> 00:33:50.579
hey, this is how I feel.

00:33:50.579 --> 00:33:53.579
I want to cry. I want to run.

00:33:53.579 --> 00:33:58.089
Sometimes my thoughts can overwhelm me.

00:33:58.089 --> 00:34:03.089
Second Corinthians 1, 3 and 4 says,

00:34:03.089 --> 00:34:07.089
praise be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:34:07.089 --> 00:34:12.090
The Father of tender mercies and the God of all comfort.

00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:18.090
Who comforts us in all our trials so that we may be able to comfort others

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:24.090
in any sort of trial, with the comfort that we receive from God.

00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:30.090
Jehovah comforts me whether it's through the Scriptures or through the congregation.

00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:34.090
And I can then offer that comfort to my daughter.

00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:39.090
If my wife were here, we'd share this burden together.

00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:43.090
But now I realize that I do share the burden with Jehovah.

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:51.940
This is how Jehovah has helped me to find balance and to be able to take care of us both.

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:55.940
Time and time again when we face difficult situations.

00:34:55.940 --> 00:35:01.940
The only one who really knows what's in my heart is Jehovah.

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:12.510
And every single time without fail, he provides a solution.

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:18.510
Like Damian and Carolina, rest assured that Jehovah will comfort you too

00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:23.510
in whatever trial you may face.

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:27.510
But what if our hardships result from our own actions?

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:33.510
In this episode of dig for treasures, note Jehovah's patience and appeal

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:41.139
to the sinful people of Joel's day.

00:35:41.139 --> 00:35:48.139
The book of Joel contains only 73 verses, but the book reveals so much about Jehovah, doesn't it?

00:35:48.139 --> 00:35:51.139
Absolutely. So let's dig in.

00:35:51.139 --> 00:35:53.139
What would you like to start?

00:35:53.139 --> 00:35:58.139
Well, we don't know much about Jehovah as a person since he recorded very little about himself.

00:35:58.139 --> 00:36:03.139
So this is a great opportunity to dig into the historical context.

00:36:03.139 --> 00:36:05.139
Great idea. Where did you find it?

00:36:05.139 --> 00:36:09.139
Well, I found the history recorded in Second Kings very interesting.

00:36:09.139 --> 00:36:16.139
In chapter 15, verse 4, it says that under King Aziraya, the high places were not removed

00:36:16.139 --> 00:36:21.139
and the people were still sacrificing and making sacrificial smoke on the high places.

00:36:21.139 --> 00:36:27.139
So Judah had a good king, but the nation was still steeped in false worship.

00:36:27.139 --> 00:36:32.139
It seems that Joel prophesied during that time. I wonder what that was like.

00:36:32.139 --> 00:36:37.139
I thought about the high places too. The inside book, under the heading high places,

00:36:37.139 --> 00:36:42.139
says that they could be found not only on hills and mountains, but also in the valleys,

00:36:42.139 --> 00:36:48.139
in stream beds and cities, and under the trees, and that frequently those high places were

00:36:48.139 --> 00:36:55.139
scenes of disgusting sexual practices, including ceremonial prostitution and child sacrifice.

00:36:55.139 --> 00:36:58.139
No wonder Jehovah hated false worship.

00:36:58.139 --> 00:37:05.139
It must have pained him so much to watch his own people deliberately engage in a decade after decade.

00:37:05.139 --> 00:37:09.139
I wonder how Joel felt seeing this taking place all around him.

00:37:09.139 --> 00:37:14.139
How many people did he personally know who were affected by this false worship?

00:37:14.139 --> 00:37:20.139
Maybe he wondered where the nation was headed and how long Jehovah was going to put up with it.

00:37:20.139 --> 00:37:22.139
Well, he didn't have to wonder indefinitely.

00:37:23.139 --> 00:37:29.139
Jehovah takes action, and he gives Joel this vivid prophecy about the awe-inspiring day of Jehovah.

00:37:29.139 --> 00:37:31.139
Imagine what that must have been like.

00:37:31.139 --> 00:37:36.139
The locust swarms that invade and strip the beautiful land of Judah bear,

00:37:36.139 --> 00:37:44.139
the clouds and thick gloom, the sun and moon turning dark, and then complete restoration.

00:37:44.139 --> 00:37:45.139
Wow.

00:37:45.139 --> 00:37:49.139
That must have been so moving for Joel.

00:37:50.139 --> 00:37:56.139
Jehovah gave Joel an outstanding glimpse of the discipline and the restoration that was in store for Israel.

00:37:56.139 --> 00:38:03.139
This must have been so reassuring to Joel, and it must have greatly affected the way he delivered that message.

00:38:03.139 --> 00:38:04.139
Think about this.

00:38:04.139 --> 00:38:11.139
It's possible that Joel was the very first prophet that Jehovah told about that great day.

00:38:11.139 --> 00:38:14.139
That brings up another great way to find treasure.

00:38:15.139 --> 00:38:21.139
Look for Jehovah's actions, and when he took the action, Jehovah's actions reveal his character.

00:38:21.139 --> 00:38:23.139
Oh, that's a great point.

00:38:23.139 --> 00:38:27.139
So, Jehovah gives Joel this incredible message.

00:38:27.139 --> 00:38:28.139
But when?

00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:29.139
Look at the timing.

00:38:29.139 --> 00:38:32.139
About 820 BCE.

00:38:32.139 --> 00:38:36.139
More than 200 years before Jerusalem was destroyed.

00:38:36.139 --> 00:38:38.139
So, think about that.

00:38:38.139 --> 00:38:44.139
Jehovah warms his people of what is coming, and then gives them plenty of time to repent and to respond.

00:38:44.139 --> 00:38:46.139
Jehovah's so patient.

00:38:46.139 --> 00:38:52.139
Even with people who should know better, even with people who deliberately hurt him and hurt others.

00:38:52.139 --> 00:38:57.139
So, we can say that even when provoked, Jehovah is patient.

00:38:57.139 --> 00:38:58.139
Yes.

00:38:58.139 --> 00:39:00.139
And let's keep going with that thought.

00:39:00.139 --> 00:39:03.139
It also says something about Jehovah's sovereignty.

00:39:03.139 --> 00:39:07.139
He's all powerful, but he doesn't force anyone to make changes.

00:39:07.139 --> 00:39:09.139
Even his own people.

00:39:09.139 --> 00:39:10.139
Jehovah's not a tyrant.

00:39:10.139 --> 00:39:11.139
He appeals.

00:39:11.139 --> 00:39:13.139
He doesn't force.

00:39:13.139 --> 00:39:15.139
And we can go further.

00:39:15.139 --> 00:39:19.139
Jehovah is impartial in exercising patience.

00:39:19.139 --> 00:39:24.139
He wanted the nation of Israel to respond to the warning, but it wasn't just the nation as a whole.

00:39:24.139 --> 00:39:29.139
Speaking of a later time, at Joel 232, Jehovah says,

00:39:29.139 --> 00:39:33.139
and everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved.

00:39:33.139 --> 00:39:38.139
He's appealing to all humans to repent and trust Jehovah's forgiveness.

00:39:38.139 --> 00:39:44.139
Not as a collective, but as individuals, every one who calls.

00:39:44.139 --> 00:39:46.139
That is a great point.

00:39:46.139 --> 00:39:48.139
Let me make a note of that.

00:39:48.139 --> 00:39:51.139
Everyone who means individuals.

00:39:51.139 --> 00:39:56.139
What a beautiful treasure about Jehovah and his sovereignty.

00:39:56.139 --> 00:39:58.139
So now, the next step.

00:39:58.139 --> 00:40:00.139
Make personal application.

00:40:00.139 --> 00:40:02.139
How does this all affect us?

00:40:02.139 --> 00:40:07.139
This makes me think, how real is Jehovah's day to me?

00:40:07.139 --> 00:40:09.139
Is it as vivid as it was to Joel?

00:40:09.139 --> 00:40:13.139
Does my share in the ministry reflect that same sense of urgency?

00:40:13.139 --> 00:40:16.139
And when I preach, am I impartial like Jehovah?

00:40:16.139 --> 00:40:21.139
Or do I perhaps avoid preaching to certain cultures or classes of people?

00:40:21.139 --> 00:40:27.139
Yeah, at Romans 10, 13, 14, Paul quoted Joel 232 and asked,

00:40:27.139 --> 00:40:30.139
how will they hear without someone to preach?

00:40:30.139 --> 00:40:36.139
We allow Jehovah to appeal to all individuals when we preach impartially.

00:40:36.139 --> 00:40:40.139
And speaking of impartiality, what if someone in the congregation

00:40:40.139 --> 00:40:42.139
has an irritating personality trait?

00:40:42.139 --> 00:40:45.139
It may be easy to be patient with our close friends,

00:40:45.139 --> 00:40:49.139
but what about brothers and sisters who get on our last nerve?

00:40:49.139 --> 00:40:52.139
Yeah, it's easy to be selective with our patients.

00:40:52.139 --> 00:40:56.139
But even if we're being provoked, what would it say about me?

00:40:56.139 --> 00:40:58.139
If Jehovah's being patient with our brother and sister?

00:40:58.139 --> 00:40:59.139
Yet I'm not.

00:40:59.139 --> 00:41:02.139
Or what if we have oversight on the congregation?

00:41:02.139 --> 00:41:05.139
When I give direction or need a council,

00:41:05.139 --> 00:41:08.139
do I force or do I appeal?

00:41:08.139 --> 00:41:10.139
Jehovah isn't a tyrant.

00:41:10.139 --> 00:41:13.139
Am I imitating the way Jehovah treats people?

00:41:13.139 --> 00:41:16.139
Wow, look at what just a few steps can lead to.

00:41:16.139 --> 00:41:18.139
Researching the historical context,

00:41:18.139 --> 00:41:21.139
looking for what actions Jehovah takes and when,

00:41:21.139 --> 00:41:24.139
and making personal application.

00:41:24.139 --> 00:41:26.139
And there's still so much more.

00:41:26.139 --> 00:41:30.139
Like for instance, what do the locusts and Joel's prophecy represent?

00:41:30.139 --> 00:41:34.139
Why did Jehovah want Israel to rip apart their hearts?

00:41:34.139 --> 00:41:36.139
What can we learn about humility from Joel?

00:41:36.139 --> 00:41:39.139
We haven't even scratched the surface yet.

00:41:39.139 --> 00:41:41.139
So let's keep going, you know?

00:41:41.139 --> 00:41:44.139
Something else I was thinking.

00:41:44.139 --> 00:41:46.139
From Joel's day to hours,

00:41:46.139 --> 00:41:50.139
Jehovah comforts us through hope.

00:41:50.139 --> 00:41:52.139
But what exactly is hope?

00:41:52.139 --> 00:41:56.139
And how can strong hope bring us daily comfort?

00:41:56.139 --> 00:42:00.139
Brother Jeffrey Winder, a member of the governing body,

00:42:00.139 --> 00:42:05.139
answers these questions in the following morning worship.

00:42:05.139 --> 00:42:08.139
This means everlasting life.

00:42:08.139 --> 00:42:11.139
That is the Christian hope, isn't it?

00:42:11.139 --> 00:42:14.139
Jehovah promises that if we remain faithful,

00:42:14.139 --> 00:42:18.139
he will grant us everlasting life either in heaven or on earth.

00:42:18.139 --> 00:42:21.139
And that hope sustains us, doesn't it?

00:42:21.139 --> 00:42:26.139
It is like an anchor that stabilizes us as we weather the storm

00:42:26.139 --> 00:42:31.139
of this old system of things until our hope is realized.

00:42:31.139 --> 00:42:36.139
But we also need what we might call short-term hope.

00:42:36.139 --> 00:42:38.139
Now what is that?

00:42:38.139 --> 00:42:44.139
We need hope that Jehovah will help us get through the day sometimes,

00:42:44.139 --> 00:42:48.139
or to help us so that our current challenge, our current trial,

00:42:48.139 --> 00:42:50.139
doesn't swallow us up.

00:42:50.139 --> 00:42:54.139
We need that because life can be discouraging at times,

00:42:54.139 --> 00:42:58.139
and hope fights discouragement.

00:42:58.139 --> 00:43:02.139
So really, we need both aspects of hope, don't we?

00:43:02.139 --> 00:43:04.139
So let's talk about hope this morning,

00:43:04.139 --> 00:43:07.139
because when we understand clearly what hope is,

00:43:07.139 --> 00:43:10.139
then we'll know what to do to keep it strong

00:43:10.139 --> 00:43:14.139
and how it can help us when we feel discouraged.

00:43:14.139 --> 00:43:17.139
So first of all, what is hope?

00:43:17.139 --> 00:43:24.139
Women in the world view hope simply as naivety or unrealistic optimism.

00:43:24.139 --> 00:43:26.139
One writer put it this way,

00:43:26.139 --> 00:43:32.139
most people seem to think that hope is just a dopey form of denying the truth.

00:43:32.139 --> 00:43:35.139
But true hope is not like that, is it?

00:43:35.139 --> 00:43:38.139
True hope has a solid basis,

00:43:38.139 --> 00:43:41.139
and is very closely related to faith.

00:43:41.139 --> 00:43:44.139
So as we define hope,

00:43:44.139 --> 00:43:49.139
it's important for us to understand this close relationship between hope and faith

00:43:49.139 --> 00:43:52.139
so that we can understand it clearly.

00:43:52.139 --> 00:43:59.139
Because on the one hand, the Bible says that faith is the basis for hope.

00:43:59.139 --> 00:44:05.139
But it also says that hope is the basis for our faith.

00:44:05.139 --> 00:44:09.139
So how are we to reconcile these things?

00:44:09.139 --> 00:44:13.139
First of all, how is faith the basis for our hope?

00:44:13.139 --> 00:44:16.139
Turn with me, please, to the book of Hebrews, chapter 11.

00:44:16.139 --> 00:44:23.369
And notice just the first part of Hebrews 11-1.

00:44:23.369 --> 00:44:26.369
How is faith the basis for our hope?

00:44:26.369 --> 00:44:35.369
Hebrews 11-1 says faith is the assured expectation of what is hoped for.

00:44:35.369 --> 00:44:42.369
So do we see the connection? Faith provides the basis, the foundation, the guarantee for our hope.

00:44:42.369 --> 00:44:49.369
Faith is what distinguishes true hope from that naive, unrealistic optimism we mentioned earlier.

00:44:49.369 --> 00:44:52.369
Now the awake illustrated it this way.

00:44:52.369 --> 00:44:55.369
It said, when you ask a dear friend for a favor,

00:44:55.369 --> 00:44:58.369
you may hope that he will help you out.

00:44:58.369 --> 00:45:04.369
Your hope is not without basis because you have faith in your friend.

00:45:04.369 --> 00:45:10.369
You know him well, and you have seen him act with kindness and generosity in the past.

00:45:10.369 --> 00:45:19.369
Your faith and hope are closely related, even interdependent, but they are distinct.

00:45:19.369 --> 00:45:21.369
So how does it work for us?

00:45:21.369 --> 00:45:32.369
Well, we have faith in Jehovah God, that he cannot lie, that everything he has ever said in the past has come true down to the letter.

00:45:32.369 --> 00:45:41.369
And so we have sure hope in his promise of everlasting life and in his promise to help us endure today.

00:45:41.369 --> 00:45:45.369
There is certainty. Faith strengthens our hope.

00:45:45.369 --> 00:45:54.059
But it works the other way as well, and the Bible indicates that hope is the basis for our faith.

00:45:54.059 --> 00:45:56.059
Now how do we understand this?

00:45:56.059 --> 00:46:05.059
Well, it turned pleased to Romans chapter 4, and notice what verse 18 says about Abraham's example.

00:46:05.059 --> 00:46:12.059
Romans 4, 18, this is speaking about Jehovah's promise to Abraham that he would have an heir.

00:46:12.059 --> 00:46:21.059
So Romans 4, 18, notice it says, although beyond hope, yet based on hope, he had faith,

00:46:21.059 --> 00:46:26.059
that he would become the father of many nations according to what had been said,

00:46:26.059 --> 00:46:29.059
so your offspring will be.

00:46:29.059 --> 00:46:33.059
Based on hope, he had faith.

00:46:33.059 --> 00:46:35.059
Now what does this mean really?

00:46:35.059 --> 00:46:37.059
Well, the watchtower explained it this way.

00:46:37.059 --> 00:46:45.059
It said hope is not just incidental to faith, it is an essential element of faith.

00:46:45.059 --> 00:46:53.059
Consider Abraham. From a human standpoint, he and his wife Sarah were past childbearing age when Jehovah promised them an heir.

00:46:53.059 --> 00:46:56.059
How did Abraham respond?

00:46:56.059 --> 00:47:01.059
Well, then it quotes Romans 4, 18, based on hope he had faith.

00:47:01.059 --> 00:47:12.059
And the watchtower said, yes, Abraham's God-given hope gave his faith that he would have an offspring a firm foundation.

00:47:13.059 --> 00:47:18.059
So Abraham believed in Jehovah God's promise. He had hope in it.

00:47:18.059 --> 00:47:26.059
And so that laid a foundation for him to exercise faith until that hope was realized.

00:47:26.059 --> 00:47:30.059
While making application to us, another watchtower said,

00:47:30.059 --> 00:47:43.059
if we truly believe the Christian hope, our whole life course will be a demonstration of our faith as was the case with Abraham.

00:47:43.059 --> 00:47:48.059
So our hope gives us something to put faith in.

00:47:48.059 --> 00:47:54.059
Our hope is that Jehovah will reward us in the future and will help us with our trials today.

00:47:54.059 --> 00:47:59.059
And Jehovah has given us those promises. We trust in them. We hope in them.

00:47:59.059 --> 00:48:04.059
And so then we can act in faith looking forward to their fulfillment.

00:48:04.059 --> 00:48:11.440
So hope and faith are closely related, interdependent, one strengthens the other.

00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:16.440
Faith makes our hope stronger because it gives us the basis, the foundation for our faith.

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:24.440
Hope also feeds our faith because if we truly believe in Jehovah's promises, then we have something to put faith in.

00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:29.820
And our whole life will be a demonstration of our faith.

00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:34.820
But now how can this help us? How can we make application of this?

00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:42.820
Well, understanding what hope is helps us to know how to cultivate it and how it can help us to fight discouragement.

00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:47.820
And our Christian hope certainly does that, doesn't it? This means everlasting life.

00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:55.820
We have faith in Jehovah and we hope that this promise will be a reality and that helps us to endure.

00:48:55.820 --> 00:49:07.539
But then we also have a promise like the one that we love so much in Isaiah chapter 41 in verse 10.

00:49:07.539 --> 00:49:10.539
Isaiah 41, 10, where Jehovah says to us,

00:49:11.539 --> 00:49:19.539
Do not be afraid for I am with you. Do not be anxious for I am your God. I will fortify you.

00:49:19.539 --> 00:49:27.539
Yes, I will help you. I will really hold on to you with my right hand of righteousness.

00:49:27.539 --> 00:49:34.539
Well, a verse like this, a promise like this helps us with what we called short term hope.

00:49:34.539 --> 00:49:40.539
That is that Jehovah will help us get through the day that our current trials will not swallow us up.

00:49:40.539 --> 00:49:45.539
It helps us to not be so discouraged by our trials.

00:49:45.539 --> 00:49:50.539
Well, both aspects of hope really need to remain bright, don't they?

00:49:50.539 --> 00:49:53.539
So how do we do that? How do we keep our hope strong?

00:49:53.539 --> 00:49:55.539
Well, what did we learn?

00:49:55.539 --> 00:50:01.539
Faith and hope work together, don't they? And so first of all, we take steps to strengthen our faith.

00:50:01.539 --> 00:50:05.539
Because we do those foundation works that build our faith.

00:50:05.539 --> 00:50:11.539
We read God's Word and meditate on it. We do personal study, prayer, meetings in the ministry.

00:50:11.539 --> 00:50:23.539
Because when our faith is strong, when Jehovah is real to us, then we will have that solid basis to believe that Jehovah will live up to his promise to help us.

00:50:23.539 --> 00:50:27.539
But also we learn that hope is the basis for our faith.

00:50:27.539 --> 00:50:31.539
So knowing that we take deliberate steps to keep our hope bright.

00:50:31.539 --> 00:50:33.539
And how do we do that?

00:50:33.539 --> 00:50:36.539
Turn please to Romans chapter 15.

00:50:36.539 --> 00:50:39.820
And notice what verse 4 says.

00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:43.960
Romans 15 4.

00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:48.960
For all the things that were written beforehand were written for our instruction.

00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:53.960
So that, skip to the end, we might have hope.

00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:57.960
Yes, God's Word gives us hope.

00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:03.960
And so we study God's Word with a specific goal of brightening our hope.

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:07.960
We read God's promises. We visualize them. We make them real.

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:12.960
We pray to Jehovah and look to him for his personal help.

00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:22.960
And when our hope is strong, that Jehovah will help us, that he will act in our behalf, then we will act in faith until that hope is realized.

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:30.960
And so on those days where maybe we get a bit discouraged and are feeling down, maybe overwhelmed or even a bit trapped,

00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:33.960
think about the promises that Jehovah has made.

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:35.960
This means everlasting life.

00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:39.960
Also that Jehovah will help you today.

00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:44.960
These are the promises that we have that have a sure foundation.

00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:48.960
We can have faith in them. We can put our hope in them.

00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:58.960
And through faith and hope, let Jehovah pull you up, brighten your outlook, and endure with joy.

00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:07.300
As Isaiah 38 says, happy are all those keeping an expectation of him.

00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:17.300
It's our sincere desire that you take brother-wenders' words to heart and find immense comfort in your precious hope.

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:32.329
In this month's program, we've learned how comfort benefits others, how to give comfort, and how to receive it.

00:52:32.329 --> 00:52:40.329
This month's music video highlights another way to offer comfort by expressing appreciation for others.

00:52:40.329 --> 00:52:43.329
It's called, tell them you love them.

00:52:43.329 --> 00:53:16.710
A beautiful road into growth, ones right there, need to know that you can have once again.

00:53:16.710 --> 00:56:37.090
And I'll ask what we feel.

00:56:37.090 --> 00:56:46.090
When we tell our brothers and sisters how much we love them, it truly bonds us as a spiritual family.

00:56:46.090 --> 00:56:50.090
Our postcard this month takes us to the Republic of Ghana.

00:56:50.090 --> 00:56:56.090
Ghana is a West African country nestled on the coast of the Gulf of Guinea.

00:56:56.090 --> 00:57:02.090
Its diverse terrain includes dense forest and miles of scenic coastline.

00:57:02.090 --> 00:57:08.090
A significant waterway in Ghana is the 1,000 mile long Volta River.

00:57:08.090 --> 00:57:19.090
A dam was built in 1965 to create Lake Volta, which to this day is still one of the largest artificial reservoirs in the world.

00:57:20.090 --> 00:57:25.090
Providing hydroelectric power across the region.

00:57:25.090 --> 00:57:28.090
Ghana is also known for its cacao.

00:57:28.090 --> 00:57:34.090
A key ingredient in chocolate, cacao is a major contributor to the country's export revenue.

00:57:34.090 --> 00:57:42.090
The fertile land that supports cacao cultivation also sustains the country's rich culinary traditions.
