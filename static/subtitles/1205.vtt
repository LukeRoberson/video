WEBVTT

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.300
I thought I would find you here

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.760
Two out of my sister

00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:34.200
Please say listen to this you are a holy people. Did you over your God?

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:41.759
And Jehovah your God has chosen you to become his people his special property

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.000
Out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.000
The words of Moses speaking to our people before they entered this land. Yes, and just before that

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.560
He told them to destroy all the idols of the gainonites. I

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.350
Wonders there are more idols in the land now than to worry then

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:08.700
At every turn are people bow and pray to them. You're doing all you can

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.620
But they don't listen

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.659
I listen

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.310
And I think you're great. You're like Elijah

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.549
I'm surprised Jehovah uses me at all

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.870
Well, I'm not you always want to do the right thing

00:01:30.989 --> 00:02:03.579
It makes us proud

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:13.900
Jonah Jonah. Yes, my lord. Get up

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:19.900
Go to Nineveh the great city and proclaim judgment against her

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:23.539
For their wickedness has come to my attention

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:36.490
I think deserve the die his response is just gonna give himself kill you need to talk to him someone

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:53.020
He's a doctor. You prepared a meal for you. I'm not hungry

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:01.939
They haven't spoken a word to me in hours your brothers are young Jonah the news you brought to us this morning

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.219
It was heavy. What did your brother say?

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:11.060
It's lies afraid they'll kill me

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.939
Skin me alive. He doesn't think they should even be warned

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.900
Just let Jehovah slaughter them all

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.900
Nebber doesn't believe they will listen

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:25.699
What do you think

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:29.379
I think if it's Jehovah's will to destroy them

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:35.300
He wouldn't have commanded me to go, but I do think Eber is right

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:42.020
Why would they listen our own people don't listen and yet the warning still goes out

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:48.060
But when is Jehovah ever asked a prophet to go to a foreign land to preach judgment against it?

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.979
Jonah I

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.780
I don't have all the answers

00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:02.539
To be sent to declare a judgment in the heart of his seren it's unlike anything Jehovah's asked his prophets to do before

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:07.699
But if his Jehovah's will that you should go then you should go

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:11.099
He must have good reason

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.620
For sending you there

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.639
trust him

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:26.170
Jonah Jonah look I'm going to pack you some cakes, too. I wish I could go with you

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:41.100
He's lies afraid they'll kill me

00:04:41.779 --> 00:05:32.279
Skin me alive leaving without saying goodbye

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.240
You need to go back inside Joanna

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:46.040
But we had things prepared for you. You'll need them in Innova. You're not going in Innova. Are you no?

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:52.399
Tarshish no Jonah that's the wrong way go back we can talk to Father Joanna

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.759
I can't go to Nineveh I just can't do it

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:03.160
What will you do in Tarshish? What will you be back? I don't know

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:06.319
Maybe never

00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:08.519
Never

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:10.519
Who's going to Nineveh?

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.040
Who's going to tell them what Jehovah said?

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:19.720
I'm sorry Joanna. I don't know what Jehovah will do, but I just can't do it. It's too much

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.240
He doesn't need me anyway. We need you and you're Jehovah's prophet

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.360
You're like Elijah remember not anymore

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:33.879
Go home Joanna. I'm sorry

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:55.379
But if his Jehovah's will that you should go then you should go

00:07:22.610 --> 00:11:39.110
Trust him. The true God will show his concern for us and we'll not perish from the true

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:44.190
And living God he has brought this storm because of me

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:47.110
Where do you come from? What is your country?

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:56.669
What people are you? I am a Hebrew and I fear Jehovah the God of the heavens the one who made the sea and the dry land. I am

00:11:57.549 --> 00:12:00.429
I was his prophet. What have you done?

00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:05.669
He told me to go to Nineveh and deliver a message instead I ran away

00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:09.309
What must we do to you to make the sea calm down for us?

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:19.409
What must we do me up and throw me into the sea and the sea will calm down for you?

00:12:19.929 --> 00:12:24.090
But I know this is because of me that this violent storm has come upon you

00:12:24.370 --> 00:13:26.539
May we not perish because of this man

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.539
It's a noun. Hold us responsible for innocent blood

00:13:31.179 --> 00:13:33.179
Since you have done as you pleased

00:13:34.179 --> 00:14:15.789
Not Jehovah. Ava's life for us

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:18.110
Our gods

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:24.710
Did nothing we should sacrifice to his God

00:14:25.509 --> 00:15:07.500
For sparing us Jehovah out of the depths of the grave

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:10.340
I cried to you for help

00:15:11.379 --> 00:15:13.379
Please hear my voice

00:15:13.379 --> 00:15:18.330
I know I have been driven away from your sight

00:15:18.809 --> 00:15:35.919
How will I gaze again upon your holy temple in my prayer come into you with a voice of thanksgiving I

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:41.250
Will sacrifice to you what I have vowed I

00:15:42.009 --> 00:17:15.759
Will pay him as John grab his other arm. Yes

00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:18.599
Why would a fish wall of you?

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:25.670
Well, I was in the water. Why are you in the water? I was on a ship

00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:29.779
Then I was in the water

00:17:29.779 --> 00:17:38.380
Because I

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.140
Tried to run away from Jehovah

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:45.539
The fish were you scared?

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.099
Yes

00:17:49.099 --> 00:17:54.230
Did you pray a lot?

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:55.430
Yes

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:59.980
Why did you pray to God if you were running away from him?

00:18:52.700 --> 00:19:01.460
Joanne, I thought you would have been back. I'm so sorry Joanne. Please forgive me

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:05.619
Mother waited for you to come home every day. He never gave up home

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:26.759
Fish how's that possible it was a miracle is lia Jehovah saved you

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:42.539
So what will you do now? I think it's time for everyone to get some rest. We can talk more tomorrow

00:19:44.859 --> 00:19:48.779
Jonah, I'm sorry about the things I said before you left. I

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:56.900
Didn't realize no matter is lia my decision to run was my own

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:34.200
Thank you. Have you back sleep well my son father. Yes, I

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.480
Can't stop thinking about those men on that ship

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:42.680
All the cargo they lost the fear in their eyes

00:20:43.319 --> 00:20:49.130
What if they didn't survive put them in danger?

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:54.089
The disobedience often hurts others Jonah

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:57.690
Not just ourselves

00:20:58.009 --> 00:21:03.460
We'll pray for those men. Do you think Jehovah will ever use me again?

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:06.500
He's shown you mercy Jonah

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.940
He brought you home

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:21.079
Let's be content with that for now. I'm sorry

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:26.390
I know my son. I know

00:21:27.269 --> 00:21:48.380
Let's try to get some rest

00:21:48.539 --> 00:22:13.160
Jonah my lord. I'm so sorry. Go to Nineveh the great city and proclaim to her the message that I tell you

00:22:16.279 --> 00:22:18.039
Yes

00:22:18.039 --> 00:22:51.460
Yes, thank you. I will do as you command made you hope I'll be with you my son

00:22:52.099 --> 00:22:53.619
He saved me from the heart of the sea

00:22:54.339 --> 00:23:03.609
You can save me again in the days ahead. I made these cakes for you

00:23:04.329 --> 00:23:11.619
Thank you, Jonah. How long will it take you to get to Nineveh?

00:23:12.339 --> 00:24:27.849
Fall goes well maybe 40 days. May it go well. Are you traveling to Nineveh? I was just there

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:31.130
I was selling some horses. I'll tell you this

00:24:32.089 --> 00:24:35.930
I'm glad to be going home. You should really be careful over there

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:41.190
That's what I've heard

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:42.470
Tell me about it

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:45.829
Well, the city is huge. It would probably take you

00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:51.269
Three days to walk around it. The charades. They're the best in the world

00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:55.349
And the horses the horses are magnificent

00:24:57.109 --> 00:24:59.109
What about the people

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:03.829
The people

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:05.430
They worship gods of war

00:25:06.069 --> 00:25:08.069
What do you think they're like?

00:25:08.309 --> 00:25:10.309
They love conquest and violence

00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:13.269
It's like bread to them

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:15.750
That's comforting

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:17.910
Don't worry

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:19.910
Just don't attract any attention to yourself

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:23.190
Stick to your business and you'll be just fine

00:25:26.549 --> 00:25:35.029
What is your business anyway? I'm a prophet of Jehovah

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:39.500
He's sending me to proclaim judgment against it

00:25:43.660 --> 00:29:23.349
The gods of war days more in just 40 days more

00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:45.380
Nineveh will be overthrown in just 40 days more

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:49.299
Nineveh will be overthrown

00:29:49.299 --> 00:29:58.950
It's 40 days more

00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:03.589
Who could possibly overthrow? It looks like an Israelite

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:06.630
The true God has spoken

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:20.039
Highlets of this city has come to the attention of the true God

00:30:20.039 --> 00:30:22.440
Jehovah the true God has spoken

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.759
This city will be destroyed

00:30:24.759 --> 00:30:27.799
Nineveh will be overthrown

00:30:27.799 --> 00:30:30.359
Jehovah the true God has spoken

00:30:30.359 --> 00:30:32.359
Your city will be overthrown

00:30:32.359 --> 00:30:34.519
In 35 days

00:30:34.519 --> 00:30:37.319
This city will be destroyed

00:30:37.319 --> 00:30:40.440
Nineveh will be overthrown

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:45.480
This city will be destroyed

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.480
In 25 days

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.400
What should we do?

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.599
Listen

00:30:50.599 --> 00:30:52.599
What should we do?

00:30:52.599 --> 00:30:54.599
Should we flee the city?

00:30:54.599 --> 00:30:55.799
You can't just leave here

00:30:55.799 --> 00:30:57.799
Should we leave our homes?

00:30:57.799 --> 00:31:03.430
Where should we go?

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:04.230
Listen

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:05.430
If we repent

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:16.390
Maybe his God will have mercy on us

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:17.750
According to the prophet

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:20.950
There is only 20 days left until the destruction of this city

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:21.910
Throughout the city

00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:23.109
People are fasting

00:31:23.109 --> 00:31:24.630
Putting on sackcloth

00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:27.349
They are asking the prophet how Jehovah wants him to behave

00:31:27.349 --> 00:31:28.789
And they're trying to do as he says

00:31:30.309 --> 00:31:32.230
Is that what Jonas telling them to do?

00:31:32.789 --> 00:31:33.430
No

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:36.549
The people simply reason that because there's a warning and time

00:31:36.549 --> 00:31:37.910
Before calamity strikes

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:44.460
Maybe this God will change his mind

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:46.460
What else have we learned about Jonas?

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:50.460
Nineveh reported overhearing a conversation of Jonas

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:53.420
It seems originally he chose not to come

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:56.140
Instead he fled to Tarshish

00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:57.980
But was thrown overboard

00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:00.539
Then he claims Jehovah sent a fish

00:32:00.539 --> 00:32:02.940
To swallow him and bring him back

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:04.940
Is he insane?

00:32:05.019 --> 00:32:06.539
Maybe not

00:32:07.259 --> 00:32:10.059
This man speaks for the God of Israel

00:32:10.059 --> 00:32:11.740
A God of miracles

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:14.059
Known for his greatness and his power

00:32:14.059 --> 00:32:15.660
He might be powerful in Israel

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:17.099
But we have our own gods here

00:32:17.099 --> 00:32:18.059
True

00:32:18.059 --> 00:32:20.220
But Jehovah is the one responsible for

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:23.019
Humiliating the gods of Egypt

00:32:23.019 --> 00:32:25.819
Even destroying their army in the red sea

00:32:26.539 --> 00:32:29.259
He's also the one who brought about the great flood

00:32:29.259 --> 00:32:31.819
Mentioned in our histories

00:32:31.819 --> 00:32:34.539
He did this because the people of the time

00:32:34.539 --> 00:32:41.240
Were extremely violent

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:48.779
Call my scribe

00:32:48.779 --> 00:33:24.059
And find the overthrow

00:33:24.059 --> 00:33:26.220
The city will be destroyed

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:36.980
Hear the word of the king people of Nineveh

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:40.180
Hear the word of the king

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:42.980
By the decree of the king and his nobles

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:46.180
No man or beast

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:47.940
Her or flock

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:49.940
Should eat anything at all

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:52.660
They should not take food

00:33:53.539 --> 00:33:55.779
Nor should they drink any water

00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:58.259
Let them be covered with sackcloth

00:33:59.059 --> 00:34:01.539
Both man and beast

00:34:01.539 --> 00:34:03.779
And let them call earnestly to God

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:07.140
And turn from their evil ways

00:34:08.019 --> 00:34:10.260
And from the violence they practice

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:12.260
Who knows

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:15.699
Whether the true God may reconsider what he intends to do

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:19.059
And turn back from his burning anger

00:34:20.099 --> 00:34:21.460
That we may not perish

00:35:22.519 --> 00:35:30.090
Something shard in the city

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:42.860
Could Jehovah change his mind

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:48.489
What would these people think of me

00:35:48.489 --> 00:35:51.849
Could as a prophet if his words don't come true

00:35:51.849 --> 00:35:56.619
Was this not my concern

00:35:56.619 --> 00:35:58.300
When I was in my own land

00:35:59.019 --> 00:36:02.139
That is why I tried to flee to Toshish in the first place

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:05.900
For I know that you are compassionate

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:07.340
And merciful God

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:08.780
Slow to anger

00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:10.380
And abundant in loyal love

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:13.099
And one who feels creed over calamity

00:36:14.059 --> 00:36:16.059
On Jehovah

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:18.780
Please take away my life

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:21.260
It is better for me to die than to live

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:35.019
Is it right for you to be so angry

00:36:35.019 --> 00:36:39.639
Was that the city

00:36:39.639 --> 00:36:44.260
Do you know your prophet of the true God

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:46.340
We have faith that you speak truth

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:47.860
Please stand our home

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:48.260
No

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:49.460
We will make you comfortable

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:50.900
Stay in the city

00:36:50.900 --> 00:39:30.500
I grew so quickly

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:37.929
Jehovah still cares for me

00:39:37.929 --> 00:41:34.579
Oh Jehovah let me die

00:41:34.579 --> 00:41:39.079
Take my life

00:41:39.079 --> 00:41:49.860
It is better for me to die than to live

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:56.889
It is right for you to be so angry

00:41:56.889 --> 00:41:58.889
Over the bottle gourd plant

00:41:58.889 --> 00:42:05.340
I have a right to be angry

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:07.500
So angry how would you die

00:42:08.619 --> 00:42:12.059
You felt sorry for the bottle gourd plant

00:42:12.059 --> 00:42:13.579
Which you did not work for

00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:16.139
Nor did you make it grow

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:18.380
It grew in one night

00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:19.900
And perished in one night

00:42:20.539 --> 00:42:24.059
Should I not also feel sorry for Nineveh

00:42:24.059 --> 00:42:25.500
The great city

00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:29.500
In which there are more than 120,000 men

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:32.539
Who do not even know right from Rome

00:42:32.539 --> 00:42:35.340
As well as their many animals

00:42:35.340 --> 00:43:43.480
Mommy said he saved us

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:46.980
No

00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:48.179
Jehovah saved you

00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:53.420
I was just

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:54.619
I was just a messenger

00:43:56.059 --> 00:44:17.380
Thank you

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:18.739
I've written about Nineveh

00:44:18.739 --> 00:44:22.550
But also about Jehovah's great mercy

00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:25.269
Both to the people there and to me

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:29.719
Was it hard to write about all that?

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:31.639
Painful

00:44:33.079 --> 00:44:34.760
So what will you do now?

00:44:36.949 --> 00:44:38.949
Whatever Jehovah asked me to do
