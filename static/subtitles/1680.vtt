00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:09.140
Our team found the encouraging example of Brother Hosea Luis Ayala, who lives in Mexico City.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:16.140
He was born deaf and then became completely blind by the age of 29.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.140
When he found the truth and wanted to study the Bible,

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:33.590
our brothers lovingly made the effort to help him overcome these obstacles.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.590
I was devastated.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.590
Being completely deaf and now blind was depressing.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.590
Life became difficult.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.590
I had to use a cane.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.590
I couldn't get around like I used to.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.590
I became afraid of walking on my own.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.590
I was very sad.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:02.560
Then I met the witnesses and they treated me well.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.560
Their conduct was different from the people at my old job who often mistreated me.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:21.849
As I learned more and more about the Bible, my life changed.

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:26.849
The brothers take turns picking him up for the meetings and then afterwards they take him back home.

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:31.849
Hosea Luis really made lots of changes to clean up his conduct and please Jehovah.

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:36.849
After several years, I approached the brothers about getting baptized.

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:38.849
They said, are you sure?

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:40.849
And I said, yes, I want to.

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:45.849
So after going over the questions, I got baptized.

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:50.849
The congregation has a loving arrangement where they assign brothers to help me prepare for the meetings.

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:54.849
Because obviously I can't see the videos or study material like the watchtower.

00:01:54.849 --> 00:02:00.849
But there are brothers who come and explain the information to me so I can put everything into braille.

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:07.859
That way I can later give comments or deliver an assignment at the meeting.

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:12.860
At the Kingdom Hall, sometimes I help with maintenance and with cleaning.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.139
I even help out in the magazine department.

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:20.139
Some in the congregation invited me to go preaching with them.

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:30.960
Three years ago, some brothers took me to a soccer field to play.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.930
The brothers were surprised at what I could do.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.930
Afterwards, they gave me a lot of delicious food and drinks.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.930
I ate and drank everything.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.930
In 2011, I was appointed as an elder.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:55.460
And for two years, I have been serving as a regular pioneer.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:01.460
The body of elders has seen that José Luis is very good at giving encouragement to other publishers in the congregation.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.770
It's interesting.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.770
We've actually assigned him to give talks to the assemblies.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.770
The audience really benefits from his way of presenting the information.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:19.430
Second Corinthians 2.10 says, for when I am weak, then I am powerful.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.430
The Spanish-speaking congregations often request him to go and give talks, even though they don't know sign language.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.430
I use my notes in braille and give the talk in sign language,

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.430
while another brother interprets simultaneously using a microphone.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.430
When I feel that 30 minutes have passed, I finish, and instead of clapping,

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.430
everybody applaud with their feet so I can feel it.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.430
They've told me that some in the audience begin to cry.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:53.430
It's not easy for me to deliver a talk, but when I realize this may encourage others, the effort is worth it.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:00.430
We all struggle with certain experiences and difficulties in life.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.430
However, when you talk with José Luis and see the things he does,

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.430
and how he loves Jehovah, how he serves him with a complete heart,

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.430
his living example shows us there is no obstacle to great.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:24.430
I think of what I was able to do before, how I could enjoy seeing beautiful gardens before I became blind.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.709
I patiently wait for the future that I have learned about.

00:04:29.709 --> 00:04:35.709
I strive to be worthy to see with my own eyes what we hope for so much.

00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:40.709
Even if I die, I know Jehovah can resurrect me.

00:04:41.709 --> 00:04:50.709
In the future, when I can see again, I can imagine the tears when I see and hear all the brothers and sisters who have been my friends,

00:04:50.709 --> 00:04:58.339
and to be able to greet them in person, how nice it will be to give them a hug.

00:04:58.339 --> 00:05:03.339
It will make me so happy and thankful for the blessing of Jehovah.

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:23.649
This is my hope.

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:30.649
Brother Ayala is grateful for the assistance from his congregation to grow spiritually.

00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:35.649
And we saw how he now enjoys giving spiritual gifts to others,

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:40.649
as he personally looks ahead to God's promises for the death and blind.
