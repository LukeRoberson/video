WEBVTT

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.759
This is the January 2018 edition of JW Broadcasting.

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:27.140
Welcome one and all.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.579
As Mark Newmer explained last month,

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.060
the governing body has approved the annual meeting of

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.659
the Pennsylvania Corporation to be broadcast each year

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:38.979
as a monthly JW Broadcasting Program.

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:42.899
In this way, more translation teams around the world will have

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.420
the resources to make this program available to

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.460
viewers in many more languages.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.179
This annual meeting was indeed special.

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:55.820
It was held on October 7th, 2017.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.859
Since it also included the dedication of many United States

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.299
branch buildings and the dedication of the World Headquarters

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:06.180
complex, it was presented from the Bethel Auditorium and

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.780
Warwick, New York.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.819
Brother Jeffrey Jackson of the governing body was the

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:12.420
chairman.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.620
The monthly program you're about to see

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.500
consists of the dedication-related aspects of the event.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.180
I'm sure you will enjoy the program.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.099
We're going to start off by asking you a question.

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:28.659
In fact, the governing body has directed me to ask the

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.500
English-speaking brothers this question.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.019
What if?

00:01:33.019 --> 00:01:38.420
What if, during brother Smollie's prayer, he said,

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.219
and we pray for the vindication of your name?

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:43.060
How would you have reacted?

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.939
Oh, no.

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.379
Feel sorry for Jean.

00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:49.379
Mm-hmm.

00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:52.420
Well, it's true in English, over the years, we have

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.340
tended to be very careful, haven't we, about saying the

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.180
sanctification of Jehovah's name and the vindication of his

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.739
sovereignty.

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:07.459
But is it necessarily wrong for us to say that Jehovah's name

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:09.259
could be vindicated?

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.740
Well, back in 1965, the Wake magazine answered, yes, it

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.939
would be wrong.

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:19.060
Then in 1995, the watchtower made the point that it re-emphasized

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.259
that.

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:22.699
It said, no one's questioning Jehovah's name.

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:26.500
So there's no need to vindicate that name.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.740
But the more we look at this subject, the more we see a need

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.020
to adjust our understanding, particularly in English.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.900
So let's think about the words associated with this problem.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.819
First of all, sanctify.

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:41.819
What does sanctify mean?

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.659
Well, it means to make holy or to treat something as holy.

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:48.419
And it's very appropriate, isn't it, that we pray for the

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:50.780
sanctification of Jehovah's name.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.020
That's exactly what Jesus told us to do.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.979
Let your name be sanctified.

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:55.780
So you can relax.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.020
There's no change with regard to that.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.659
But what about the word vindicate?

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:06.060
Well, vindicate usually indicates exonerating or proving

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.860
that someone is correct in something they've done.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.259
Perhaps they've been criticized, and then they've proved

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:14.620
to be true or correct.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.460
And what about the word name?

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.379
Does it just refer to an identification or a label?

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.620
Well, that's usually not the case in the Bible, is it?

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.060
It oftentimes refers to the reputation of the person, not

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.020
just their identifying name or label.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.939
For example, in Proverbs chapter 22 verse 1, it tells us

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.259
a good name is to be chosen rather than great wealth.

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:46.620
Now in that case, name is referring to the reputation

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.340
of the person.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.379
So let's think for a few minutes.

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:55.580
What really has Satan criticized down through time?

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.659
Well, first of all, he's criticized Jehovah's reputation,

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:02.300
his name.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.740
And secondly, he has criticized the rightfulness of Jehovah's

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.939
sovereignty, or in other words, the way of ruling.

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:15.539
So really, both of these things, Jehovah's reputation

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:20.100
and his way of ruling need to be vindicated.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.339
Satan has tried to besmirch the holy name of Jehovah

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:26.779
in many ways, one way is by painting

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:31.899
him as a vengeful harsh God, or in the churches

00:04:31.899 --> 00:04:35.980
of Christen and believing that he is a God that burns people

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.459
in a fiery hell.

00:04:37.459 --> 00:04:40.420
Or in the scriptures, we see him implying that Jehovah

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:45.540
is a liar who holds back good things from his creatures.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.980
Well, in that case, we can see that Jehovah's name or reputation

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.899
does need to be exonerated, or in other words, vindicated.

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:59.139
So in summary, Jehovah's sovereignty certainly

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:02.259
needs to be vindicated, as we've always said.

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:07.060
But also his name as a loving God, his reputation

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.980
needs to be vindicated.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:14.699
So it's not wrong for us to say that these actions of vindicating

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:17.939
Jehovah's sovereignty, vindicating his name

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:21.500
lead to the sanctification of his name.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.339
Now, at this point, you're trying to think,

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:24.579
what does that mean?

00:05:24.579 --> 00:05:28.420
Simply put, it's not wrong to say,

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.420
we pray for the vindication of Jehovah's name,

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.620
because his reputation certainly needs to be exonerated.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.420
And what a privilege we have to be part of that.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.220
Well, what a way to start the annual meeting right

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.500
off the block, new understanding.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.980
So if this is how we're going to start with the Germans

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.019
and saying a few words, what else is on the program?

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:57.379
Well, we're looking forward to seeing what we can enjoy.

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:02.019
Well, when we think of this matter of the dedication program,

00:06:02.019 --> 00:06:06.660
I'm sure you do appreciate that it's impossible for us

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.819
to tell every story of every experience

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:14.060
of how our brothers and sisters have seen Jehovah's

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.379
hand help them, either in their personal lives

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:20.139
or in the actual construction work.

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:22.019
In just a few moments' time, we're

00:06:22.019 --> 00:06:26.139
going to have an opportunity to see, especially prepared video,

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:28.779
that will tell us some of those stories.

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:32.060
But this video is mainly designed to tell us

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.620
about what happened with the construction here at Warwick.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.300
But before we start to watch the video,

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.379
the governing body asks me to express appreciation

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:47.379
on their behalf for a very special group

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:51.259
of brothers and sisters who we're talking about.

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:54.180
Well, those thousands of brothers and sisters

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.620
who were working on all the other projects

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.139
that were being either built or renovated

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:03.819
at the same time as the Warwick project.

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:06.019
So sometimes we focus on Warwick,

00:07:06.019 --> 00:07:08.100
but all these other brothers and sisters

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.540
were likewise making similar sacrifices.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.980
And some of those projects were huge.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:19.500
For example, Warkill, over 1.1 million square feet

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.100
of facilities were either built or renovated

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.540
or remodeled at Warkill.

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:29.139
And 302 residents rooms were added.

00:07:29.139 --> 00:07:34.500
This required 25,000 sheets of drywall to be hung.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:39.899
And over 451,000 feet of electrical wire cables

00:07:39.899 --> 00:07:41.740
to be installed.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:46.500
Additionally, new office space was made for 240 people.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.379
Now, when they added up how many brothers and sisters

00:07:49.379 --> 00:07:52.939
actually helped with just the Warkill project,

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:56.060
they came up with a figure of over 6,000

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.060
different individuals.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:02.259
Then the brothers at one stage started a Saturday work program

00:08:02.259 --> 00:08:06.259
that was designed to give extra help to the project.

00:08:06.259 --> 00:08:09.579
And the better lights who have other assignments

00:08:09.579 --> 00:08:13.220
who in their spare time offered to give this extra help

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:18.139
on a Saturday numbered 1,544.

00:08:18.139 --> 00:08:21.740
And they put in over 10,000 hours of work.

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.060
Then we had 937 outside volunteers

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:28.259
from 20 different states here in the United States

00:08:28.259 --> 00:08:31.620
who contributed some 18,000 hours.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:35.220
So a lot of work went into renovating and building

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:36.980
there at Warkill.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:39.340
But what about the quality of the work there?

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.419
Was it any less?

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:42.220
No.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:46.340
In fact, the F residents and the Warkill office building

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:50.019
received the highest award of four green lobes

00:08:50.059 --> 00:08:52.299
from the Green Building Initiative.

00:08:52.299 --> 00:08:54.500
That's the GBI.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:58.379
That was back in 2015.

00:08:58.379 --> 00:09:01.139
Now, at that time, a project manager of GBI

00:09:01.139 --> 00:09:05.100
said of the 23 buildings in the United States

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:10.100
that have been certified with four green lobes since 2006.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.539
The Watchtower Warkill office building

00:09:12.539 --> 00:09:17.580
achieved the highest point score with 94%.

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:21.700
Now, of course, since 2015, other buildings

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:25.740
have also received these four green lobes.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.139
But remember, also among those buildings

00:09:28.139 --> 00:09:33.620
have received all seven buildings here at Warwick.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:36.740
Well, we could go on and on about your hovers blessings

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.179
with regard to the Warkill project.

00:09:39.179 --> 00:09:41.100
But let's just take one example.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:46.940
The Warkill Chiller project that started in December of 2010.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.980
It was critical the brothers tell us

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:52.019
to get the new Chiller's operational no later

00:09:52.019 --> 00:09:55.139
than the first week in the following July.

00:09:55.139 --> 00:09:57.299
But there was a problem because they

00:09:57.299 --> 00:10:01.059
wanted to make sure the presses would continue to operate.

00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:04.379
This is how one of the brothers expressed what happened.

00:10:04.379 --> 00:10:07.460
He said, by mid-June, I remember July,

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.700
they had to have the chillers up and running,

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:13.779
things started to get critical due to the lack of response

00:10:13.779 --> 00:10:17.659
from the specialist from the chiller fabricator.

00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:20.860
The purchasing department called repeatedly,

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:23.139
but were unable to get a commitment

00:10:23.139 --> 00:10:26.379
from the fabricator to meet our deadlines.

00:10:26.379 --> 00:10:27.659
So what did the brothers do?

00:10:27.659 --> 00:10:32.340
Well, they made it a matter of fervent and urgent prayer.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.500
What happened, the brother continues.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:38.019
A few days later, I received a phone call telling me

00:10:38.019 --> 00:10:40.580
that there was a man from the chiller fabricator waiting

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.700
for me in the main lobby.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.779
He wanted to quickly see our startup schedule

00:10:45.779 --> 00:10:48.779
and our installations and then give us a list of things

00:10:48.779 --> 00:10:50.860
we needed to complete.

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.659
We explained that everything was ready

00:10:53.659 --> 00:10:57.620
and we needed to begin the startup in two weeks.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.820
Well, he went for a visit.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:03.700
As he walked through the factories he was amazed.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:07.740
He said he has never seen an installation in all the 20 years

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.460
that he's been doing this that was

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:12.899
ready to start on the first visit.

00:11:12.899 --> 00:11:16.139
Then as he was continuing to be amazed,

00:11:16.139 --> 00:11:20.779
he said to the brother, let me know who your insulators are.

00:11:20.779 --> 00:11:24.379
I want to hire them.

00:11:24.379 --> 00:11:26.700
Well, the brother said very wisely.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:30.460
He didn't tell him until later that most of the work was done

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:36.179
by his sisters, many of whom had no experience at all.

00:11:36.179 --> 00:11:38.259
We didn't say telling that because we didn't want him

00:11:38.259 --> 00:11:41.340
to steal him away to other projects.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:43.059
The brother then goes on to say,

00:11:43.059 --> 00:11:45.019
eventually he got enough courage to ask him,

00:11:45.019 --> 00:11:49.419
well, what caused you to actually come to the lobby that day?

00:11:49.419 --> 00:11:53.299
Well, the man said he'd received an urgent trouble call

00:11:53.299 --> 00:11:56.539
from another customer in a nearby town.

00:11:56.539 --> 00:12:00.700
So he decided he'd just stopped by Watchtower on the way.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.179
He then said the trouble called turned out

00:12:03.179 --> 00:12:05.779
to be a false alarm.

00:12:05.779 --> 00:12:07.940
Well, the chiller started on schedule

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.820
and everything was operating according to plan.

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:12.740
So that's just one of many.

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:19.220
Now believe me, they sent me reams of papers of experiences.

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:23.059
And those that I didn't use, please forgive me.

00:12:23.059 --> 00:12:25.940
But over and over again, we see the brothers

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:29.539
expressing how they appreciated the opportunity

00:12:29.539 --> 00:12:32.899
to work on the Woke Hill project as well as the other projects

00:12:32.899 --> 00:12:36.019
and how they saw Jehovah's Hand blessing them

00:12:36.019 --> 00:12:39.460
as many of them sold homes, simplified their lives,

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:43.659
or put their lives on hold so that they could be here with us.

00:12:43.659 --> 00:12:46.139
So to all those brothers and sisters

00:12:46.139 --> 00:12:49.379
who were working on all the peripheral projects,

00:12:49.379 --> 00:12:52.220
we want to say to you, thank you,

00:12:52.220 --> 00:13:09.750
thank you from the bottom of our hearts.

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:12.789
And now we have an opportunity to watch a video

00:13:12.789 --> 00:13:15.750
that's going to have an interview with the CPC,

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:19.309
who are the CPC, the construction project committee

00:13:19.309 --> 00:13:26.740
who organized the work here at Woke.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:30.019
Isaiah chapter 40 and verse 12 gives us a glimpse

00:13:30.019 --> 00:13:33.659
into the power and the breadth of Jehovah's Hand.

00:13:33.659 --> 00:13:35.460
Remember, that's where it says that Jehovah

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.820
holds all the water in the hollow of his hand.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:41.220
He can measure the universe with the span of his hand.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.179
And while this is figurative,

00:13:43.179 --> 00:13:46.259
it helps us to appreciate what Jehovah can accomplish

00:13:46.259 --> 00:13:48.580
to make sure his will takes place.

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.340
But when we look at the beautiful warwick project,

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:54.659
we truly see that Jehovah's Hand was involved

00:13:54.659 --> 00:13:56.580
in what took place there.

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.899
Now last year, you remember at the annual meeting,

00:13:58.899 --> 00:14:00.899
we had the interview of the five brothers

00:14:00.899 --> 00:14:03.700
who made up the construction project committee.

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.899
And those brothers were the ones who oversaw

00:14:06.899 --> 00:14:08.740
and coordinated the work of that project.

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:12.659
And they explained how the warwick project took place.

00:14:12.659 --> 00:14:15.539
Well, this year at this special dedication program,

00:14:15.539 --> 00:14:18.340
we are again going to interview these dear brothers.

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:21.779
And this time, they're going to tell us their experiences

00:14:21.779 --> 00:14:24.860
and experiences that they had that convinced them

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:27.659
that Jehovah's Hand was in this project.

00:14:27.659 --> 00:14:29.940
Well, we've got some really touching experiences

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:32.779
to relate about ones who really sacrificed

00:14:32.779 --> 00:14:34.580
in order to volunteer on the project

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.580
and how their family supported them.

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:38.059
They're really going to be beautiful.

00:14:38.059 --> 00:14:40.379
And we also have some good experiences

00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:43.620
in regards to how the work was accomplished

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.139
and seeing Jehovah's Hand.

00:14:45.139 --> 00:14:47.539
And lastly, we're going to see how Jehovah's Hand

00:14:47.539 --> 00:14:50.259
was really shown even in non-believers

00:14:50.259 --> 00:14:53.220
in what they experienced and how the work was accomplished.

00:14:53.259 --> 00:14:55.460
Let's get started with the aspect of how

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.340
those who came to work on the project

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:58.379
saw Jehovah's Hand.

00:14:58.379 --> 00:15:01.100
And I think Rich, you had an overarching comment

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.100
that really convinced you of this.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:06.460
Despite challenging weather and long commutes,

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:10.259
difficult living situations, hard jobs,

00:15:10.259 --> 00:15:13.100
our brothers manifested the fruitage of the spirit.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:14.500
You could see that at work

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:16.299
and you knew Jehovah was working with them

00:15:16.299 --> 00:15:17.940
and motivating their work.

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.659
And it really made the project something very special.

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:25.059
One couple had decided that with their circumstances

00:15:25.059 --> 00:15:27.860
and their finances that for a maximum

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.379
they could come and work for three weeks

00:15:29.379 --> 00:15:31.659
on the project, which they did.

00:15:31.659 --> 00:15:33.700
But during the third week, they were asked

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.659
if they could possibly extend to a fourth week.

00:15:36.659 --> 00:15:39.659
So they prayed to Jehovah, please just give us joy,

00:15:39.659 --> 00:15:41.620
help us not have anxiety about this.

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:44.740
Even though our finances will be at zero,

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.340
we want to stay the fourth week.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:49.539
They did, went on their way home,

00:15:49.539 --> 00:15:52.539
packed the airport and at the departure gate,

00:15:52.539 --> 00:15:55.299
there was an announcement that the flight was over booked.

00:15:55.299 --> 00:15:58.299
They were looking for volunteers to take a later flight.

00:15:58.299 --> 00:16:01.100
And in compensation, the airline would give

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.700
a very significant amount of cash.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:07.620
Well, they took the cash no longer had their finances at zero.

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:09.820
But that's not where they felt Jehovah's Hand.

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:11.779
They felt that that last week,

00:16:11.779 --> 00:16:13.500
the joy while they were working

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.419
and not having the anxiety

00:16:15.419 --> 00:16:17.419
over what the final outcome might be.

00:16:17.419 --> 00:16:21.179
I'll never forget the night the Troy called in our room

00:16:21.179 --> 00:16:24.539
and said that one of our volunteers

00:16:24.539 --> 00:16:26.259
that were going to be arriving,

00:16:26.259 --> 00:16:29.500
they were fixing a tire alongside the road back at their home.

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:34.419
And the brother's young wife was holding the flashlight,

00:16:34.419 --> 00:16:35.620
car veered off the road,

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.620
hit her, killed her right in front of him.

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:38.899
Yeah, he'd already been invited

00:16:38.899 --> 00:16:40.500
and already scheduled to come.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.220
But when this happened, we didn't expect him to come.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.460
Then we reassured him that it's okay

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:46.740
to stay back and handle matters.

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.059
He was determined to come.

00:16:48.059 --> 00:16:50.220
What was amazing was to see how Jehovah

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:51.940
helped him during that time.

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:54.860
His overseers that were assigned to care for him

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:57.340
and the department he worked with, they rallied to him.

00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:00.580
And in the end, he says he felt that this experience

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:04.779
helped him to recover emotionally, spiritually,

00:17:04.779 --> 00:17:06.819
and he saw Jehovah's blessings in it.

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:09.220
And it gave him pure evidence

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:11.740
that Jehovah's promises will come true.

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:15.019
A brother came for a week,

00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:19.900
but his wife was back home with very serious health problems.

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:24.220
The wife told her husband, you must go.

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:28.140
You must go, this is the way I can make a sacrifice

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:29.579
to the project.

00:17:29.579 --> 00:17:33.779
So seeing Jehovah's hand on sisters like that

00:17:33.779 --> 00:17:36.619
and their self-sacrificing spirit,

00:17:36.619 --> 00:17:38.099
it made us feel like those sisters

00:17:38.099 --> 00:17:40.660
were right there working on the project.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.380
As we got into the project,

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.900
as it became evident that this project really was

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.819
only going to get done as a result of Jehovah's spirit,

00:17:47.819 --> 00:17:51.740
we saw our brothers transform themselves.

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:57.220
They recognized that we were first and foremost spiritual men.

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:58.579
We needed Jehovah's blessing.

00:17:58.579 --> 00:18:02.259
So before meeting started, the brothers would get together

00:18:02.259 --> 00:18:03.619
and say a prayer.

00:18:03.619 --> 00:18:05.460
It was clear to everyone who was only

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.579
going to be as a result of Jehovah's spirit

00:18:07.579 --> 00:18:09.380
that this project was going to get done.

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:13.140
These overseers quickly became known

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:17.339
not for their trade skills, but for being shepherds.

00:18:17.339 --> 00:18:19.099
They looked out for the brothers and sisters.

00:18:19.099 --> 00:18:20.420
They cared about them.

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:22.859
So as a committee, we assign shepherding calls

00:18:22.859 --> 00:18:25.660
to ourselves three to four months

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:28.180
and along with other shepherding within our departments.

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:32.539
But you would see these dear brothers and sisters come in

00:18:32.539 --> 00:18:34.980
at the end of a day for a shepherding call,

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.380
dirt or grease from head to toe,

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:42.380
cold, gloves on, ear warmers, huge smiles.

00:18:43.299 --> 00:18:46.940
You could just feel that Jehovah was just lifting us up

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:48.619
and moving us along another day.

00:18:48.619 --> 00:18:50.099
It was quite an experience.

00:18:50.099 --> 00:18:52.900
It was as if Jehovah was telling us

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.900
a spirituality is more important

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.059
in each other than accomplishing the work.

00:18:57.059 --> 00:19:00.579
And that really helped us to see where our priority should be.

00:19:00.579 --> 00:19:02.859
We found that as long as we looked out for the friends,

00:19:02.859 --> 00:19:05.500
spiritually and emotionally as best we could,

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:09.059
they did far and above anything we could have ever hoped for.

00:19:09.059 --> 00:19:11.099
It really was a wonderful example.

00:19:11.099 --> 00:19:14.059
How they responded to a spiritual atmosphere.

00:19:14.059 --> 00:19:15.819
Troy, how about the local brothers and sisters?

00:19:15.819 --> 00:19:18.220
They had a good share, too.

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:19.619
The local brothers and sisters

00:19:19.619 --> 00:19:23.180
and the congregations surrounding the project were tremendous.

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.259
Quite a few would come in early in the morning

00:19:25.259 --> 00:19:27.859
to help guide the buses to their parking spots,

00:19:27.859 --> 00:19:32.380
to provide safe walkways, to direct traffic and parking.

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:36.180
And they would get up very early, freezing cold temperatures.

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:38.859
They would have breakfast and then they would have to go

00:19:38.859 --> 00:19:42.460
off to their secular work and taking care of their daily lives.

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:44.940
It was really a good example of self-sacrifice.

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:48.299
Another thing that they did, which was just outstanding,

00:19:48.299 --> 00:19:54.500
is we had up to 700 trips to the airport on a given weekend.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.259
Volunteers coming, volunteers going.

00:19:56.259 --> 00:20:00.299
And it was constant for years at a time.

00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:05.339
And yet most of those airport runs were done by our local friends,

00:20:05.339 --> 00:20:06.700
even using their own vehicles.

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:09.259
Now you brought this porch yourself out on the project.

00:20:09.259 --> 00:20:12.460
You personally saw Jehovah's Hand helping you,

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:13.859
just when you needed it the most.

00:20:13.859 --> 00:20:15.619
Could you share a few of those?

00:20:15.619 --> 00:20:18.900
I remember an instance where we were meeting

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:23.019
with a governing body member on something else.

00:20:23.019 --> 00:20:27.819
In the conversation, it just lent itself to the question,

00:20:27.819 --> 00:20:32.220
just what was it that made him or the rest of the governing body

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:36.180
so convinced that this project was going to get done

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:37.700
on time?

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:41.700
And he explained, during the acquisition of the property,

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:44.740
they had established terms in the acquisition

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.619
that for them was a sort of a coal test.

00:20:47.619 --> 00:20:54.140
And Jehovah fulfilled the test exactly as they expected.

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:57.740
And from that point on, he mentioned that he himself

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:01.819
and every one of the members of the governing body to a man

00:21:01.819 --> 00:21:05.099
were firmly convinced that it was Jehovah's will

00:21:05.099 --> 00:21:06.900
to move from Brooklyn to Warwick.

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.180
I needed to transmit that confidence to the brothers

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:12.180
on the project as well.

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:14.900
We were getting ready to step off the bridge

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.740
so to speak and some big decisions

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:19.660
that we weren't going to be able to retract.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:22.259
Big dollars that were going to be spent for product

00:21:22.259 --> 00:21:25.339
that we weren't going to be able to send back,

00:21:25.339 --> 00:21:27.299
we needed more faith.

00:21:27.299 --> 00:21:29.819
I can remember two instances in particular

00:21:29.819 --> 00:21:31.940
where I personally was discouraged,

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.140
and you can kind of see it in our family.

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:37.099
And in both those times, a governing body member

00:21:37.099 --> 00:21:39.940
showed up unscheduled and visited

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:43.660
and made personal expressions to us, expressions to the family.

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:46.940
And it was just what we needed to keep us going.

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:48.900
But now let's change our thought a little bit.

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:52.019
We also talked about how you sewed Jehovah's hand

00:21:52.019 --> 00:21:53.859
and how the work was accomplished.

00:21:53.859 --> 00:21:59.980
Jehovah caused our brothers to become not only good tradesmen,

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:02.579
but world class expert tradesmen.

00:22:02.579 --> 00:22:06.099
It was very common to see them take off their hard hats

00:22:06.099 --> 00:22:07.660
and say a group prayer.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.299
They realized it was a part of their worship

00:22:10.299 --> 00:22:12.500
and it facilitated Jehovah's hand

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:15.019
to be expressed through their work as well.

00:22:15.019 --> 00:22:18.140
Then you notice Rick, they felt a real need

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:19.500
to have Jehovah's spirit,

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:20.980
to be able to do what they needed to do.

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:24.420
So they would look for an opportunity to pray

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:26.579
before they tried to accomplish something.

00:22:26.579 --> 00:22:29.619
That feeling that they really cured

00:22:29.619 --> 00:22:31.019
and it was part of their worship

00:22:31.019 --> 00:22:34.140
was even reflected in the prayerful attitude

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.140
with which they went about the work.

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:38.500
We would often inform the family

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:40.700
of a difficult challenge or problem

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:43.700
that we were facing either as a committee or as a project.

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:45.900
We would ask them to pray about it.

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:47.980
And they would come back and tell us,

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:49.180
I've been praying about this.

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:51.740
And then we would hear their families back home

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:53.259
were praying about it.

00:22:53.259 --> 00:22:58.259
And we would regularly get cards and letters from the field.

00:22:59.259 --> 00:23:00.500
Family worship projects.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.059
The kids would draw pictures and send them to us.

00:23:03.059 --> 00:23:06.579
And they put care packages, hundreds of them together.

00:23:06.579 --> 00:23:10.140
We even got cards and letters from all over the world,

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.500
Japan, Australia, and Europe.

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:17.740
One sister from Europe sent about 65 pounds of Swiss chocolate

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:19.579
for the family to enjoy.

00:23:19.579 --> 00:23:22.579
And Rick, remember our infamous Friday afternoon,

00:23:22.579 --> 00:23:26.380
design, coordination, and construction meeting every time

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:28.339
after prayer would start the same way.

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:32.740
We don't have what we need, brothers, to work next week.

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:36.460
We don't have sufficient enough drawings.

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.460
Rick would be there working.

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.819
He'd be back and forth emailing with other ones.

00:23:40.819 --> 00:23:42.660
He'd be getting stuff sent in.

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:46.259
We would conclude that meeting at five o'clock on a Friday

00:23:46.259 --> 00:23:48.940
every time with, you know what?

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:51.299
We have enough to work till next Friday.

00:23:51.299 --> 00:23:52.180
And they're poor Rick.

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:54.140
They would go again the following Friday.

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:57.259
We'd start back up again, but Jehovah would give us

00:23:57.259 --> 00:23:58.099
what we needed.

00:23:58.099 --> 00:24:01.940
As if it was telling us, don't worry, I've got this.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.380
I've got it under control.

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:05.019
Just keep working.

00:24:05.019 --> 00:24:07.700
You also mentioned some comments regarding the use

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:11.059
of the construction groups and how that came about.

00:24:11.059 --> 00:24:15.819
We had the most qualified people you could ever find

00:24:15.819 --> 00:24:18.180
there ready to go to work.

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:20.259
We simply didn't have enough of them.

00:24:20.259 --> 00:24:21.819
It was a matter of numbers.

00:24:21.819 --> 00:24:26.579
And so the committee charged a couple of us

00:24:26.579 --> 00:24:29.900
to look in and see what could we do

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:33.019
to mobilize the nation in an organized way.

00:24:33.019 --> 00:24:35.180
All we had was a Saturday afternoon.

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:36.460
And I thought, this isn't enough time.

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:38.660
You can't organize this effort.

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:42.779
We sat down at 1.30 by 3 p.m.

00:24:42.779 --> 00:24:46.700
What would become known as the Warwick construction group effort.

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:47.980
Jehovah built it.

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:50.460
He laid it out in front of us.

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:52.019
How each building would be cared for.

00:24:52.019 --> 00:24:53.259
Yeah, did we adjust a few things

00:24:53.259 --> 00:24:54.099
if we went along?

00:24:54.099 --> 00:24:55.099
Absolutely.

00:24:55.099 --> 00:24:56.380
But that was the framework.

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:59.059
We divided the country up into 11 different areas.

00:24:59.059 --> 00:25:01.059
We appointed three brothers in each area that

00:25:01.059 --> 00:25:03.579
would kind of help identify the volunteers and bring them.

00:25:03.579 --> 00:25:04.700
Reach out to the volunteers.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:05.740
Tell them we need them.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.500
Explain the work ahead of time.

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.779
And it was really an amazing arrangement

00:25:09.779 --> 00:25:14.099
of the 27,000 volunteers that we had on site.

00:25:14.099 --> 00:25:17.180
21,000 were organized and sent to Warwick

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:19.579
by these 11 construction groups.

00:25:19.579 --> 00:25:22.700
So they would do any initial training

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:24.740
that they needed to do and get organized

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:27.819
so that they could come to Warwick and hit the ground running.

00:25:27.819 --> 00:25:30.299
Do you remember when we had the challenge

00:25:30.299 --> 00:25:32.740
with pipe insulation?

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:35.420
How many miles of pipes do we have?

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:38.539
Hundreds of miles of pipes to insulate.

00:25:38.539 --> 00:25:40.579
That was a trade that really didn't

00:25:40.579 --> 00:25:42.579
exist among the brotherhood in the United States,

00:25:42.579 --> 00:25:45.420
at least not nearly the number we would need.

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:47.660
And so our construction group brothers

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:50.420
said, well, how hard can it be?

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:52.940
Will put on training programs?

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:55.099
And so one or two, I think, came to Bethel

00:25:55.099 --> 00:25:57.259
saw how it was done.

00:25:57.259 --> 00:26:00.579
The group started putting on training in the field at a kingdom hall

00:26:00.579 --> 00:26:02.700
or at a brother's home.

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:05.940
And they trained about 2,000 volunteers,

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:09.140
how to do pipe insulation, mostly sisters.

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:12.059
And they did all of that work.

00:26:12.059 --> 00:26:15.259
And they did a really professional job at it.

00:26:15.259 --> 00:26:18.140
I think that also speaks to how the role

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:20.259
the sisters played on our project.

00:26:20.259 --> 00:26:22.420
The ones that were assigned there, the ones in the field

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:24.660
that were coming in, they played a tremendous role.

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:26.420
We sought Jehovah's Spirit on them

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:28.740
in helping us resolve problems and accomplishing

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:29.740
the work and so forth.

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:32.619
So with our training programs and orientation,

00:26:32.619 --> 00:26:38.339
the brothers quickly understood that safety and spirituality

00:26:38.339 --> 00:26:41.660
is a personal expression between them and Jehovah first.

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:43.819
Safety is a spiritual value.

00:26:43.819 --> 00:26:46.579
It's something that we owe our brothers and sisters,

00:26:46.579 --> 00:26:47.859
we owe our families.

00:26:47.859 --> 00:26:50.779
We owe to Jehovah who is the source of life.

00:26:50.779 --> 00:26:53.259
We had many non-believers involved in this project.

00:26:53.259 --> 00:26:56.299
How did they even get to see Jehovah's hand in this?

00:26:56.299 --> 00:26:58.140
We were meeting with different officials

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:00.980
on a particular aspect of the project.

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:04.140
And we had a bit of a difference of opinion

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:06.180
as to what would be needed.

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:09.980
But we really were not able to reach an agreement

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:12.140
with the officials.

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:17.259
At that point, we realized taking the secular technical approach

00:27:17.259 --> 00:27:18.779
wasn't going to work.

00:27:18.819 --> 00:27:23.299
Push the plans aside, set a silent prayer,

00:27:23.299 --> 00:27:26.940
and then just ask the officials, what can we do

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.539
to address your concerns?

00:27:28.539 --> 00:27:30.779
What would you like to see us do?

00:27:30.779 --> 00:27:33.539
That changed the tone of a discussion.

00:27:33.539 --> 00:27:37.779
It changed from a technical base discussion to more.

00:27:37.779 --> 00:27:40.140
We're here to work together as neighbors,

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:41.619
to come to a common accord.

00:27:41.619 --> 00:27:44.140
And we eventually worked out a compromise

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:45.619
that met their concerns.

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:49.420
A few weeks later, we were back in front of the same officials,

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:51.460
but on a totally different subject.

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:53.740
But before we could even present what we were there

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:56.819
to talk about, they stopped us and they just wanted

00:27:56.819 --> 00:28:00.259
to commend us for how good the last meeting we had went.

00:28:00.259 --> 00:28:02.460
We were looking at each other because we didn't think

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:03.859
it went that well.

00:28:03.859 --> 00:28:08.259
But they pointed out how they felt that they were dignified

00:28:08.259 --> 00:28:12.140
and they really appreciated the way we worked with them.

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:15.380
So it became clear to us that this project

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:18.460
wasn't entirely about technical issues,

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:21.940
but really about manifesting to hove his hand

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:23.420
through the footage of the spirit

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:25.700
as we even dealt with the officials.

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:30.420
We had our fuel truck that was in a local shop

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:31.980
getting repaired.

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:33.980
And the fuel truck is critical for our project

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:36.180
because at four o'clock in the morning, 4.30,

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:38.339
our brothers are out there to fuel the equipment.

00:28:38.339 --> 00:28:39.900
So we can get the work done that day.

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:41.579
They called it to go pick it up.

00:28:41.579 --> 00:28:43.940
And the gentleman told him, sorry, we're closed.

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:44.779
What project are you on?

00:28:44.779 --> 00:28:46.740
And he says, well, with the work project here,

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.460
which hove is witnesses of watch tower.

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:49.859
He goes, oh, watch tower.

00:28:49.859 --> 00:28:50.619
Oh, no problem.

00:28:50.619 --> 00:28:51.819
I'm going to leave the gate open.

00:28:51.819 --> 00:28:53.539
I'm going to show you where the keys are.

00:28:53.539 --> 00:28:54.980
I'll have it there for you.

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:56.299
And you can take the vehicle.

00:28:56.299 --> 00:28:58.380
He says, I trust you people.

00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:01.019
One of the bus drivers, he showed up late one morning.

00:29:01.019 --> 00:29:03.900
And then he explained why he was late.

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:05.940
He had been assigned the wrong bus that morning.

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:09.700
And his dispatcher made him come back and switch buses.

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:11.019
He says, I was so mad at him.

00:29:11.019 --> 00:29:13.859
I told him, these people are working for God.

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:14.740
They're not getting paid.

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:16.180
They have to get to work on time.

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:17.619
They have to do this work.

00:29:17.619 --> 00:29:18.619
He then told the friends.

00:29:18.619 --> 00:29:21.099
He says, I know I'm going to be one of Jehovah's Witnesses

00:29:21.099 --> 00:29:21.619
one day.

00:29:21.619 --> 00:29:24.460
I'm going to serve my God, Jehovah.

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:25.299
And then he sat down.

00:29:25.299 --> 00:29:26.420
He drove the friends to work.

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:27.980
A brother was out in the ministry.

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:29.460
And he knocks on the gentleman's door.

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:31.380
The gentleman comes and starts his presentation.

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:34.500
And interrupts him and says, have you been to Warwick?

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:36.859
And the brother steps back and, well, no one's allowed

00:29:36.859 --> 00:29:37.380
to warwick.

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:38.980
It's under construction.

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:40.339
He goes, no, I've been there.

00:29:40.339 --> 00:29:41.059
I worked there.

00:29:41.059 --> 00:29:42.900
And it was very clean, organized,

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:45.700
and the people were the most friendliest people I've ever seen.

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:48.140
It was the best experience of my life

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:50.180
to work on that project.

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:53.099
One of the jobs was to pull in this main feeder,

00:29:53.099 --> 00:29:56.779
this main electrical line, into the complex, very

00:29:56.779 --> 00:29:57.660
technical piece.

00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:01.460
And so we had that scheduled for December 24th.

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:03.700
And there was a little bit of an aversion on the point

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:06.180
of the contractors that wanted to be able to monitor

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:07.299
when this was going in.

00:30:07.299 --> 00:30:09.500
And we said, no, I'm sorry.

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:11.019
This is the date we need to do this.

00:30:11.019 --> 00:30:12.339
We're on a day-to-day schedule.

00:30:12.339 --> 00:30:14.539
We need to accomplish, well, who's going to do it?

00:30:14.539 --> 00:30:17.539
Well, as you know, we use women a lot on this site.

00:30:17.539 --> 00:30:19.059
And this is a crew of sisters.

00:30:19.059 --> 00:30:19.940
Well, I can't believe that.

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:20.859
That's a heavy line.

00:30:20.859 --> 00:30:23.339
And that can't be striking in the ground.

00:30:23.339 --> 00:30:25.259
It's fragile until it gets into the conduit.

00:30:25.259 --> 00:30:27.420
He said, well, I wasn't working tomorrow.

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:29.460
I'm going to call my wife, and I'm going to come in tomorrow

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:30.420
anyway.

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:33.259
Sure enough, he came in, spent a couple hours there.

00:30:33.259 --> 00:30:36.099
Our sisters, as usual, did phenomenal work,

00:30:36.099 --> 00:30:38.099
pulled the line in, got it done.

00:30:38.099 --> 00:30:40.059
Do you remember how long it took them to the war?

00:30:40.059 --> 00:30:40.900
Two hours.

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:41.700
They had to pull in.

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:42.259
Two hours?

00:30:42.259 --> 00:30:44.539
Yeah, it was just phenomenal.

00:30:44.539 --> 00:30:47.140
He just shook his head and went home.

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:50.019
We hired the largest contractor in that part of New York State

00:30:50.019 --> 00:30:52.619
to perform a significant amount of work on site.

00:30:52.619 --> 00:30:55.660
And toward the end of the project, the head of that company

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:58.380
told us, he said, when you first came to us,

00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:00.299
and you described what you were going to build

00:31:00.299 --> 00:31:01.660
and the size of it.

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:05.380
And then you told us the schedule that you were hoping to meet.

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:08.259
And then you told us you were going to do it with volunteers.

00:31:08.259 --> 00:31:10.259
He said, when we were happy to take your money,

00:31:10.259 --> 00:31:14.019
but when you left, we were literally laughing at you.

00:31:14.019 --> 00:31:16.700
We knew there was no way you could ever

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:19.500
do this much construction in that short of a time,

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:21.900
let alone with volunteers, and that this was going

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:23.099
to be a disaster.

00:31:23.099 --> 00:31:25.099
We're not laughing anymore.

00:31:25.099 --> 00:31:28.099
So they could see Jehovah's Hand on that project.

00:31:28.099 --> 00:31:31.259
Well, we thank all of you for those very, very encouraging

00:31:31.259 --> 00:31:32.099
experiences.

00:31:32.099 --> 00:31:35.779
It makes us think of Isaiah chapter 59, verse 1, which

00:31:35.779 --> 00:31:38.500
reminds us that Jehovah's Hand is not too short

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:39.660
to accomplish as well.

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:42.819
And this is truly evident on this project.

00:31:42.819 --> 00:31:45.980
And I know you, brothers, would as well as all of us

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:47.900
to thank all who had a share in this,

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:50.460
all those who physically came here to volunteer,

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:53.980
the local brothers and sisters who supported all from home

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:58.420
and everybody with their prayers, we truly appreciate that.

00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:00.660
And we'd also like to thank you, five brothers,

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:02.660
and the sacrifices that you and your wives

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:04.779
made during this project.

00:32:04.779 --> 00:32:07.779
And another evidence for me that Jehovah's Hand

00:32:07.779 --> 00:32:10.500
was in this project is, you five brothers

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:11.660
are all friends.

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:14.180
And just interacting with one another and being with you,

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:17.539
you could see that that's evidence of Jehovah's Spirit.

00:32:17.539 --> 00:32:20.779
But ultimately, our thanks goes to Jehovah

00:32:20.779 --> 00:32:23.980
for what took place because we know he, ultimately,

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:26.259
was behind the success of this project.

00:32:26.259 --> 00:32:28.099
And we're very thankful that all of us

00:32:28.099 --> 00:32:30.819
had a chance to witness a Jehovah's Hand

00:32:30.819 --> 00:32:40.160
in action in what took place.

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:44.039
Well, that certainly was a beautiful experience, wasn't it?

00:32:44.039 --> 00:32:46.680
And for those of us that are visiting here,

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:49.720
if you meet someone who worked on the project,

00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.839
make sure to ask them, how did you

00:32:51.839 --> 00:32:55.160
see Jehovah's Hand in helping you personally

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.160
and in the project?

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:59.200
And you may be surprised at what stories you learn

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:01.599
by asking that question.

00:33:01.599 --> 00:33:03.400
Well, at this point, what we're going to do

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:07.480
is something a little different and interactive exam or test

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:12.000
to see who qualifies to remain in the auditorium for that.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.599
Now, what we'd like you to do is, first of all,

00:33:14.599 --> 00:33:18.319
you have to answer the question, how many facilities

00:33:18.319 --> 00:33:20.400
are being dedicated today?

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:24.039
Then list them in alphabetical order.

00:33:24.039 --> 00:33:27.160
Well, you know, we're not going to do that to you.

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.960
But that little wire you felt will be a leg

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:32.480
when you watched the next video, which

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:40.490
tells you about the facilities that are going to be dedicated.

00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:43.210
To support the kingdom work, expansion

00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:46.849
has recently been underway within the United States.

00:33:46.849 --> 00:33:50.289
This involves the construction of the new world headquarters

00:33:50.289 --> 00:33:52.970
at Warwick, along with 15 other buildings

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:58.609
being dedicated at the 2017 annual meeting.

00:33:58.609 --> 00:34:02.569
Let's visit each site and see how these buildings

00:34:02.569 --> 00:34:06.369
affect us in our kingdom service and ultimately

00:34:06.369 --> 00:34:09.449
bring praise to Jehovah.

00:34:09.449 --> 00:34:13.409
Videos have become an important tool in our worship

00:34:13.409 --> 00:34:16.170
and so the need to produce them faster

00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:20.250
and in greater quantity has risen dramatically.

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:24.289
Five years ago, the department produced one feature film

00:34:24.289 --> 00:34:28.570
each year, along with a handful of smaller videos.

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:38.900
During 2016, that number grew to more than 350 productions.

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:41.659
The existing facilities in Patterson

00:34:41.659 --> 00:34:44.900
consisted of three smaller studios.

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:47.980
To produce more content simultaneously,

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:52.619
a larger production space with multiple stages was needed.

00:34:52.619 --> 00:34:56.260
In early 2015, on Mount Ibo Road,

00:34:56.260 --> 00:35:00.260
a large building less than five miles away from Patterson

00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:01.579
was acquired.

00:35:01.579 --> 00:35:04.860
Originally built as a pharmaceutical warehouse,

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:10.900
the building had more than 70,000 square feet of open space.

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:13.059
Work began to convert the warehouse

00:35:13.059 --> 00:35:17.179
into one large sound stage and two smaller stages.

00:35:17.179 --> 00:35:21.380
Renovations were completed in December 2016.

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:24.139
The request for videos is certainly not slowing down.

00:35:24.139 --> 00:35:25.860
It's increasing.

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:31.900
So we have scheduled for 2017 around 420 videos

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:36.059
that will be used for various aspects of the organization.

00:35:36.059 --> 00:35:40.340
So we have seen the need to have increased personnel,

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:44.300
increased facilities to accommodate all these requests.

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:49.139
So we can see that Jehovah has raised up brothers and sisters,

00:35:49.139 --> 00:35:51.219
or gifts and men and women,

00:35:51.219 --> 00:35:54.059
that have been able to help produce the beautiful music

00:35:54.059 --> 00:35:58.260
we have, the videos that are touching minds and hearts.

00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:00.739
Just one mile away from Mount Ibo,

00:36:00.739 --> 00:36:03.739
a 12,000 square foot building was purchased

00:36:03.739 --> 00:36:09.500
and converted into a carpentry shop for building props and sets.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:13.460
The mountain view apartments were also purchased and renovated,

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:18.460
providing housing for 100 Bethel family members.

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:22.739
From the oversight of congregations and meeting arrangements

00:36:22.739 --> 00:36:26.940
to territory assignments and other aspects of the preaching work,

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:30.500
kingdom activities are overseen by the Branch Committee

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:36.900
with direction provided by the Service Department.

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:39.179
In the United States branch,

00:36:39.179 --> 00:36:42.019
there was a need for expanded facilities

00:36:42.019 --> 00:36:45.340
to house these departments at Wal-Kill.

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:48.340
The work for the Wal-Kill Expansion Project

00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:52.619
was basically completed in November of 2015.

00:36:52.619 --> 00:36:55.619
It involved new construction for residence buildings,

00:36:55.619 --> 00:36:59.820
the new F Garage, and the new office building.

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:03.500
So between the new and the renovated facilities,

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:07.260
it was over 1,000,000 and 18,000 square feet.

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:09.699
You had to remember, too, at the same time,

00:37:09.699 --> 00:37:11.900
all the departments are still running.

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:14.179
You know, meanwhile, all these buildings

00:37:14.179 --> 00:37:16.139
are going up around us.

00:37:16.139 --> 00:37:18.099
I'm sure it didn't appear this way to the workers,

00:37:18.099 --> 00:37:21.380
but to us, it was like it was on a high-speed video

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:23.059
at the rate that it went up.

00:37:23.059 --> 00:37:24.940
It was incredible.

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:28.579
It wasn't just their skills and expertise that they brought.

00:37:28.579 --> 00:37:31.500
It was their zeal, it was their joy,

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:33.579
it was their positive attitude

00:37:33.579 --> 00:37:35.139
that they were able to maintain

00:37:35.139 --> 00:37:37.260
even despite the heavy workload.

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:40.940
And that engenders appreciation and zeal

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:43.900
among all of those who've come in contact with them.

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:48.860
Many are taking advantage of tools such as JW Library

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:57.269
and the JW Language App to read, study, and teach the Bible.

00:37:57.269 --> 00:38:00.309
The increased use of technologies like these

00:38:00.309 --> 00:38:03.309
has created the need for more computer engineers

00:38:03.309 --> 00:38:09.110
and other personnel to design, develop, and test this software.

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:11.710
Workspace and housing for these volunteers

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:14.469
is now being provided at the Rivercrest Department

00:38:14.469 --> 00:38:17.230
Complex in Fishkill.

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:21.150
Another important concern of the United States branch

00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:25.590
involves caring for senior members of the Bethel family.

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:29.750
To meet that need, work was completed in 2016

00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:32.230
on Congregate North and South.

00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:35.909
Congregate living is really home care.

00:38:35.909 --> 00:38:39.510
Home care for the most precious ones among our Bethel family.

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:42.550
We're surrounded by many wonderful brothers and sisters

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:46.469
who are very hard working and care so much about us.

00:38:46.469 --> 00:38:48.190
And this is such my heart.

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:50.349
Blessings are being able to be with friends

00:38:50.349 --> 00:38:51.989
that we've known for years.

00:38:51.989 --> 00:38:54.590
It's like a reunion that doesn't stop.

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:57.670
So hope is really taking good care of all of them.

00:38:57.670 --> 00:39:02.630
The care that our dear older ones receive is outstanding.

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:05.869
And it's true that we have people who care, but there's a reason.

00:39:05.869 --> 00:39:08.309
It reflects Jehovah's view of older ones.

00:39:08.309 --> 00:39:10.389
He says in Isaiah 46-4,

00:39:10.389 --> 00:39:15.469
until you grow old, I will carry you.

00:39:15.469 --> 00:39:19.630
And that's how those who've been trained by Jehovah

00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:20.909
treats the older ones.

00:39:20.909 --> 00:39:28.019
So it's really a loving atmosphere that they're in.

00:39:28.019 --> 00:39:30.860
To receive and store building materials,

00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:36.340
a 220,000 square foot warehouse was purchased in 2014

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:38.260
in Montgomery, New York.

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:40.739
At the Montgomery warehouse, materials

00:39:40.739 --> 00:39:43.860
were staged and residential bathrooms for warwick

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:47.420
were prefabricated, speeding up construction on site.

00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:51.059
The warehouse continues to be used as a storage facility

00:39:51.059 --> 00:39:55.539
for both the US branch and the World Headquarters.

00:39:55.539 --> 00:39:59.260
In 2014, two hotels were purchased.

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:02.340
Newberg Center A and Newberg Center B.

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:05.860
Being centrally located between all three sites,

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:09.340
these hotels have been ideal for housing temporary workers

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:12.980
and hosting guests, visiting the Bethel facilities.

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:15.699
These hotels were great help for the workers.

00:40:15.699 --> 00:40:17.940
They were going to be now closer to the project

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:20.500
before with that long commute from Brooklyn.

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:23.500
On the bus, I was tiring by the time they got to work.

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:26.300
But now they were closer so they could get a little more rest

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:29.420
in the evenings in the mornings and be more productive.

00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:31.420
These workers are lovable.

00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:33.179
You have to love them.

00:40:33.179 --> 00:40:36.099
You think about all the sacrifices they left homes,

00:40:36.099 --> 00:40:41.219
told homes, left jobs, businesses, a family, friends,

00:40:41.219 --> 00:40:42.059
their pets.

00:40:42.059 --> 00:40:44.300
You thank them, but they thank you.

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:45.980
They thank you for the privilege of coming,

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:48.579
even though they're the ones that made so many sacrifices.

00:40:48.579 --> 00:40:53.860
So they're an encouragement to the rest of us.

00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:57.139
The plan to relocate the world headquarters to Warwick

00:40:57.139 --> 00:40:59.380
goes back more than eight years

00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:03.900
when we first purchased this 253 acre property,

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:06.619
50 miles northwest of Brooklyn.

00:41:06.619 --> 00:41:09.539
Some of the reasons that Brooklyn was so advantageous,

00:41:09.539 --> 00:41:12.340
no longer are such a key role for us.

00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:14.539
And then just the fact of living in a city

00:41:14.539 --> 00:41:17.139
that continues to get bigger and bigger,

00:41:17.139 --> 00:41:20.139
it created more and more complications, more costs.

00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:22.860
But I often think, even so,

00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:25.539
the real reason we moved out of Brooklyn

00:41:25.539 --> 00:41:28.619
is what the governing body has said from the beginning,

00:41:28.619 --> 00:41:32.900
that they are convinced Jehovah's Spirit directed them

00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:34.059
to move out of Brooklyn,

00:41:34.059 --> 00:41:36.300
and to come up here to Warwick, New York.

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:38.099
And we're looking forward, at some point in time,

00:41:38.099 --> 00:41:39.260
we're gonna look back and we're gonna say,

00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:42.460
what are all the other reasons why Jehovah directed that

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:44.139
to take place?

00:41:44.139 --> 00:41:48.300
The Warwick property included a number of abandoned buildings

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:51.380
that needed to be demolished and removed.

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:54.820
Once the site was cleared and plans were approved,

00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:59.179
construction began on July 29, 2013,

00:41:59.179 --> 00:42:02.300
and moved at a remarkable pace.

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:05.460
About 4,000 a day were coming to the site,

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:08.380
over 27,000 of our brothers and sisters worked here.

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:10.860
Then you had everybody in Bethel from the governing body,

00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:12.739
all the way down to departments,

00:42:12.739 --> 00:42:16.659
everybody was united in making this project a success.

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:18.820
And there were challenges,

00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:21.179
but they would be settled in peace and love

00:42:21.179 --> 00:42:24.340
and all the qualities of Jehovah's Spirit.

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:26.539
That is a modern day miracle,

00:42:26.539 --> 00:42:28.659
especially when you think about the world we're living

00:42:28.659 --> 00:42:31.940
and that is so fragmented and lack of unity.

00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:32.940
And so you look at that,

00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:36.500
it just makes you so proud to be part of this organization.

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:38.699
I remember the first time visiting Warwick

00:42:38.699 --> 00:42:40.300
after a completion.

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:42.659
I call it a happy sad moment,

00:42:42.659 --> 00:42:45.099
happy because now the buildings were gonna be used

00:42:45.099 --> 00:42:47.059
for the intended purpose,

00:42:47.059 --> 00:42:50.980
but sad because you didn't see the high-vis vest anymore.

00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:53.860
It was a beautiful scene with all those colorful vests

00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:55.940
and now you didn't see them, so I was sad.

00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:59.260
You get choked up, you realize that behind every vest

00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:04.400
it was a beautiful kingdom story and you missed them.

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:07.320
The environment here at Warwick is just beautiful.

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:09.400
It's quiet, it's refreshing.

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:11.360
And it makes me really appreciate

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:13.800
Jehovah's creation around us.

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:15.000
It's beautiful to be here

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.320
and I thank Jehovah for the privilege.

00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:20.679
Warwick is a complex of eight buildings,

00:43:20.679 --> 00:43:24.960
more than a million and a half square feet of construction.

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:28.599
Bethel Housing is provided in four residence buildings

00:43:28.599 --> 00:43:32.320
with 569 rooms along with another residence

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:36.519
in nearby Sterling Forest with another 21 rooms.

00:43:36.519 --> 00:43:40.679
And just a short distance away is the Tuxedo facility,

00:43:40.679 --> 00:43:42.559
Computer Department Engineering

00:43:42.559 --> 00:43:46.079
and the Broadcasting Studio are located here

00:43:46.079 --> 00:43:48.559
where the monthly broadcast is produced

00:43:48.559 --> 00:43:52.679
and now made available in over 130 languages.

00:43:54.039 --> 00:43:58.039
The Office Services Building primarily serves as the hub

00:43:58.039 --> 00:44:01.360
for most World Headquarters functions.

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:04.679
The building also includes three exhibits

00:44:04.679 --> 00:44:08.679
where visitors can take self-guided tours.

00:44:08.679 --> 00:44:11.440
The Bible and the Divine Name,

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:14.320
which features rare Bibles and highlights

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:18.840
how God's Name has been preserved in the Scriptures.

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:22.400
The exhibit, a people for Jehovah's Name,

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:25.440
a visual history of Jehovah's Witnesses

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:28.519
and World Headquarters Faith in Action,

00:44:28.519 --> 00:44:31.559
which explains how witnesses are organized

00:44:31.559 --> 00:44:36.559
to study, teach and live by what we learn in the Bible.

00:44:39.539 --> 00:44:42.460
You travel anywhere in the United States branch

00:44:42.619 --> 00:44:44.980
or internationally for that matter

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:47.980
and there's someone who has worked on Warwick.

00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:50.820
And the feeling that you get is,

00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:53.380
Warwick is not the World Headquarters,

00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:55.420
it's our World Headquarters.

00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:58.059
I've heard a number say, when they go back home,

00:44:58.059 --> 00:44:59.739
they're never gonna be the same.

00:44:59.739 --> 00:45:02.579
Some have simplified, so they've moved from a big house

00:45:02.579 --> 00:45:04.460
to an apartment, others have started pioneering,

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:06.260
so that's what they're gonna do.

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:08.940
It's really been a witness to the witnesses.

00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:12.019
Jehovah looks for opportunity to bless his people

00:45:12.059 --> 00:45:15.059
that makes him happy and you turn it around now

00:45:15.059 --> 00:45:17.340
and you look at all the work that's gone into this.

00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:20.500
When he sees all those who volunteer

00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:21.699
to come on the project,

00:45:21.699 --> 00:45:23.659
all of our brothers and sisters around the world

00:45:23.659 --> 00:45:26.780
who made donations, those who included it in their prayers,

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:28.900
those who helped others to come.

00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:30.900
How proud that must make Jehovah

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:34.820
and he's just looking to bless them for that.

00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:38.219
I sometimes try to imagine the conversations in heaven

00:45:38.219 --> 00:45:41.179
between the angels and the kings in heaven

00:45:41.179 --> 00:45:44.340
and how they're so proud of all these workers down here.

00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:47.019
And no doubt, many of them were involved in the project.

00:45:47.019 --> 00:45:49.019
We think of the workers here on earth,

00:45:49.019 --> 00:45:50.579
but how about the workers in heaven?

00:45:50.579 --> 00:45:53.099
They may have been involved in more than a few times

00:45:53.099 --> 00:45:55.900
with safety issues, with legal matters,

00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:58.139
so Jehovah was proud of everyone,

00:45:58.139 --> 00:46:01.219
his universal family, both in heaven and on earth

00:46:01.219 --> 00:46:02.420
with these projects.

00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:06.659
I feel that it's going to build up the spirituality

00:46:06.659 --> 00:46:09.099
of our brothers and sisters as they come

00:46:09.099 --> 00:46:11.619
and as we know they're coming from all over the world.

00:46:11.619 --> 00:46:14.420
And that's only going to further advance the work.

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:18.059
These buildings are beautiful

00:46:18.059 --> 00:46:19.579
and it's a beautiful setting

00:46:19.579 --> 00:46:21.699
that brings praise to Jehovah.

00:46:21.699 --> 00:46:23.420
But what will bring the greatest praise

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:27.099
is how these buildings, these tools will be used

00:46:27.099 --> 00:46:30.820
to honor his name, to bring attention to his kingdom,

00:46:31.659 --> 00:46:34.059
to spearhead the preaching work.

00:46:34.059 --> 00:46:37.500
What these buildings will help the governing body accomplish

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:48.260
will bring the greatest praise to Jehovah.

00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:51.059
So now we will be passing out those tests.

00:46:52.539 --> 00:46:55.780
Now, now is the time for an interactive part of our program

00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:58.820
where we have an opportunity to raise our voices

00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:00.500
in praise to Jehovah.

00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:02.659
So if you'd like to stand if you're able,

00:47:02.659 --> 00:47:07.139
we're going to sing our new dedication song at this time.

00:47:07.139 --> 00:47:10.059
And remember, that's entitled A Place

00:47:10.059 --> 00:47:56.230
that Will Bring You Praise.

00:48:12.400 --> 00:50:25.650
What a beautiful song, sung beautifully.

00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:28.090
If you'd like to take your seats,

00:50:28.090 --> 00:50:29.929
we've now arrived at the time

00:50:29.929 --> 00:50:33.449
a highlight of our program, The Dedication Talk.

00:50:33.449 --> 00:50:35.449
And this is going to be given to us

00:50:35.449 --> 00:50:39.010
by the longest serving member of the current governing body

00:50:39.010 --> 00:50:40.489
for the Garrett Losh.

00:50:40.489 --> 00:50:43.730
And the title of his talk, Expansion,

00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:50.579
that glorifies Jehovah.

00:50:50.579 --> 00:50:54.940
Modern day worship of Jehovah began in a small way.

00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:57.900
It calls to mind the scripture that says,

00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:00.699
according to Zechariah 4, 10,

00:51:00.699 --> 00:51:04.059
who has despised the day of small beginnings?

00:51:05.179 --> 00:51:07.059
What is the context of the scripture?

00:51:08.059 --> 00:51:11.659
In the year 537 before our common era,

00:51:11.659 --> 00:51:14.420
Jehovah moved Persian King Cyrus,

00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:18.019
who had conquered Babylon to release the Israelites

00:51:18.019 --> 00:51:21.219
that were held captive there for 70 years,

00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:25.059
opening the way for them to return to Jerusalem and Judah.

00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:27.900
They were to restore true worship

00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:31.619
and rebuild the temple that Nebuchadnezzar had destroyed.

00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:36.699
How many exiles returned to Jerusalem from Babylon

00:51:36.699 --> 00:51:41.699
in 537 BCE, according to Ezra 4.1, about 50,000.

00:51:44.739 --> 00:51:49.420
A footnote in the sixth edition of Isaac Lee's Bible translation

00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:53.699
suggests that including women and children,

00:51:53.699 --> 00:51:57.460
the number amounted to about 200,000.

00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:02.139
In the seventh month of the year 537,

00:52:02.139 --> 00:52:06.579
the altar was set up and in the following year 536,

00:52:06.579 --> 00:52:09.699
the foundation of the new temple was laid.

00:52:09.699 --> 00:52:11.460
But after laying the foundation,

00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:16.219
they neglected to rebuild the temple on that foundation.

00:52:16.219 --> 00:52:20.380
Enemies around about also discouraged them from doing so.

00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:24.820
The enemies succeeded to place a ban on the work

00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:29.820
about 15 years later in 522 before common era.

00:52:32.219 --> 00:52:34.739
Two years after that in 520,

00:52:34.739 --> 00:52:38.019
stirred up by the prophet's haggai and Zachariah,

00:52:38.019 --> 00:52:39.900
governance the robbable and Joshua,

00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:43.059
the high priest courageously resumed the construction

00:52:43.059 --> 00:52:45.059
of the temple despite the ban.

00:52:46.019 --> 00:52:49.260
Jehovah proclaimed that the hands of the robbable

00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:51.780
have laid the foundation of this house

00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:54.940
and his own hands will finish it.

00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:59.500
For who has despised the day of small beginnings?

00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:01.860
Zachariah 4, 9, and 10.

00:53:03.019 --> 00:53:05.739
The rebuilding of Jehovah's temple at Jerusalem

00:53:05.739 --> 00:53:07.340
had a modest beginning, yes,

00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:09.619
but it was not to be despised.

00:53:09.619 --> 00:53:12.619
After all, it involved true worship,

00:53:12.619 --> 00:53:15.179
pure worship of Jehovah.

00:53:16.739 --> 00:53:20.739
520 BCE saw this day of small beginnings,

00:53:20.739 --> 00:53:25.739
but in 515 BCE, 22 years after the return from Babylon

00:53:25.739 --> 00:53:30.059
and five years after the construction project was resumed,

00:53:30.059 --> 00:53:32.420
the temple was completed.

00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:35.500
The former exiles held the inauguration,

00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:39.739
or we could say, dedication of this house with joy.

00:53:39.739 --> 00:53:43.579
It is verse 6, 13 through 16.

00:53:43.579 --> 00:53:47.940
And this resulted in Jehovah's praise.

00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:51.059
He was glorified by the rebuilt temple.

00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:54.380
There were also small beginnings

00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:58.820
for the Christian congregation at Pentecost 33

00:53:58.820 --> 00:54:00.219
of our common era.

00:54:01.539 --> 00:54:06.539
And Jesus related this illustration in Matthew chapter 13

00:54:06.699 --> 00:54:10.699
verses 31 and 32.

00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:21.099
The kingdom of the heavens is like a mustard grain

00:54:21.099 --> 00:54:23.860
that a man took and planted in his field.

00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:26.940
It is, in fact, the tiniest of all the seeds,

00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:28.579
but when it has grown,

00:54:28.579 --> 00:54:31.260
it's the largest of the vegetable plants

00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:34.059
and becomes a tree so that the birds of heaven

00:54:34.059 --> 00:54:38.829
come and find lodging among its branches.

00:54:38.829 --> 00:54:41.269
What's the meaning of Jesus illustration

00:54:41.269 --> 00:54:42.590
of the mustard grain?

00:54:43.590 --> 00:54:46.989
The grain itself represents the kingdom message,

00:54:46.989 --> 00:54:48.989
as well as what results from the preaching

00:54:48.989 --> 00:54:52.510
of that message, the Christian congregation.

00:54:52.510 --> 00:54:56.349
Like the mustard grain that is the tiniest of all the seeds,

00:54:56.349 --> 00:54:59.429
the Christian congregation had small beginnings

00:54:59.429 --> 00:55:01.829
in 33 of our common era.

00:55:01.829 --> 00:55:03.909
However, within a few decades,

00:55:03.909 --> 00:55:06.469
the congregation grew rapidly.

00:55:06.469 --> 00:55:10.349
It expanded beyond all expectations.

00:55:10.349 --> 00:55:12.750
Jesus tells us that the birds of heaven

00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:16.349
were able to find lodging among its branches.

00:55:16.349 --> 00:55:21.269
These figurative birds picture right-hearted individuals

00:55:21.269 --> 00:55:24.230
who find spiritual food, shade, and shelter

00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:26.510
within the Christian congregation.

00:55:28.070 --> 00:55:31.869
There were also small beginnings in modern times.

00:55:31.869 --> 00:55:34.070
Consider our first headquarters.

00:55:35.269 --> 00:55:39.230
In modern times, the Bible students, as we were called,

00:55:39.230 --> 00:55:44.230
had headquarters offices first at 101 Fifth Avenue in Pittsburgh

00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:49.230
and thereafter at 44 Federal Street, Allegheny, Pennsylvania.

00:55:50.909 --> 00:55:55.070
By the late 1880s, they built their own structure.

00:55:55.070 --> 00:55:58.710
Completed in 1889 at Arch Street,

00:55:58.710 --> 00:56:02.309
it was known as the Bible House.

00:56:03.829 --> 00:56:05.710
Due to continued expansion,

00:56:05.710 --> 00:56:09.949
headquarters was transferred to Brooklyn, New York

00:56:09.949 --> 00:56:13.469
in the years 1908, 1909.

00:56:14.389 --> 00:56:17.750
In 1908, the old Plymouth Bethel,

00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:21.670
13 through 76th Street, Brooklyn, was purchased.

00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:25.389
It belonged to the Plymouth Congregational Church.

00:56:25.389 --> 00:56:28.230
Also, 124 Columbia Heights, close by,

00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:30.869
was purchased from the Plymouth Church.

00:56:30.869 --> 00:56:34.670
It soon became the new home of our headquarters,

00:56:34.670 --> 00:56:37.869
staff of at that time, 30 persons.

00:56:37.869 --> 00:56:41.710
And they called it Bethel, meaning House of God.

00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:44.469
Bethel was the name the Plymouth Church

00:56:44.469 --> 00:56:47.750
had given to their building in Hick Street.

00:56:48.789 --> 00:56:50.670
The remodeled Hick Street building

00:56:50.670 --> 00:56:53.710
then became known as the Brooklyn Tabernacle.

00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:56.349
It housed offices and an auditorium.

00:56:57.230 --> 00:57:01.670
On January 31, 1909, 350 persons were present

00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:05.110
for the dedication of the new headquarters.

00:57:06.869 --> 00:57:10.869
But there were also small beginnings in a different sense,

00:57:10.869 --> 00:57:14.909
in 1919 of our common era.

00:57:14.909 --> 00:57:18.070
The statement in Zechariah 410

00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:20.869
about small beginnings applied after

00:57:20.869 --> 00:57:23.750
the Israelites had returned from Babylon.

00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:26.550
Was there a parallel in modern times?

00:57:26.550 --> 00:57:27.670
Yes.

00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:30.309
In our century, for Jehovah's,

00:57:30.309 --> 00:57:33.550
in the 90 Christians, it was a day of small beginnings

00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:37.989
in 1919 when they were completely freed

00:57:37.989 --> 00:57:40.869
from domination by Babylon, the great,

00:57:40.869 --> 00:57:44.110
the world, conglomerate of false religion,

00:57:44.110 --> 00:57:47.869
in order to restore true worship.

00:57:47.869 --> 00:57:49.309
Already in the years before,

00:57:49.309 --> 00:57:52.150
they had progressively cleansed themselves

00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:53.670
from Babylon, the great.

00:57:54.869 --> 00:57:59.150
From 1914 to 1919, the brothers lived through a number

00:57:59.150 --> 00:58:01.630
of crises and tests.

00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:04.590
But this came to an end in 1919.

00:58:04.590 --> 00:58:07.070
The memorial of Christ's death was celebrated

00:58:07.070 --> 00:58:10.110
on Sunday, April 13, 1919,

00:58:10.110 --> 00:58:15.110
with 17,961 attending in many lands.

00:58:15.630 --> 00:58:17.949
This was, of course, a lot less than the number

00:58:17.949 --> 00:58:20.550
of returnees from literal Babylon.

00:58:21.590 --> 00:58:26.070
And of these 18,000, about 4,000

00:58:26.070 --> 00:58:28.150
also reported field service.

00:58:29.429 --> 00:58:31.590
Many looked down on the brothers.

00:58:31.590 --> 00:58:33.550
Yes, there were, again, small beginnings,

00:58:33.550 --> 00:58:36.230
but still they were approved by Jehovah,

00:58:36.230 --> 00:58:40.230
and therefore he caused expansion ever since.

00:58:41.110 --> 00:58:43.630
There's expansion in the material sense.

00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:46.789
In order to meet together in worship,

00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:50.909
last year about 1,000 properties were purchased

00:58:50.909 --> 00:58:55.030
and new kingdom halls constructed on it.

00:58:55.030 --> 00:58:57.710
In addition, there were many more

00:58:57.710 --> 00:59:01.869
where major or minor renovations were done.

00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:05.829
Ranch offices are being expanded

00:59:05.829 --> 00:59:09.110
or newly built remote translation offices,

00:59:09.110 --> 00:59:13.750
Bible schools, facilities and assembly halls.

00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:16.869
In the United States, we have now 47

00:59:16.869 --> 00:59:18.550
active assembly halls.

00:59:19.949 --> 00:59:23.269
Also, there is expansion in numbers.

00:59:23.269 --> 00:59:25.429
In the Democratic Republic of Congo,

00:59:25.429 --> 00:59:28.309
there were almost 1.2 million

00:59:28.309 --> 00:59:30.710
who attended the memorial this year.

00:59:31.829 --> 00:59:34.429
In Mexico, without Central America,

00:59:34.429 --> 00:59:38.309
there were about 2.2 million who attended.

00:59:39.469 --> 00:59:42.710
Worldwide, about 20 million attended

00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:45.630
the memorial of Christ's death last year.

00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:51.789
Each weekend, an average of 5,300 new ones

00:59:51.789 --> 00:59:56.070
are getting baptized and becoming our brothers and sisters,

00:59:56.070 --> 00:59:59.869
our worldwide family and brotherhood grows.

01:00:01.110 --> 01:00:03.429
But our numerical expansion in itself

01:00:03.429 --> 01:00:05.789
is not proof that we have the truth.

01:00:05.789 --> 01:00:07.829
Other religions have many more members

01:00:07.829 --> 01:00:09.949
and some grow quickly.

01:00:09.949 --> 01:00:13.550
There are about 1.5 billion Muslims in the world,

01:00:13.550 --> 01:00:16.989
second only to the number of name Christians,

01:00:16.989 --> 01:00:19.269
but numbers alone prove nothing.

01:00:19.269 --> 01:00:21.989
Truth is not measured in numbers,

01:00:21.989 --> 01:00:25.670
but the combination of truth-teaching, true love,

01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:28.630
high moral standard, neutrality,

01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:31.949
caring and sanctifying God's holy name,

01:00:31.949 --> 01:00:33.949
together with the increase,

01:00:33.949 --> 01:00:35.949
that does prove beyond doubt

01:00:35.949 --> 01:00:40.929
that Jehovah has chosen us as his people.

01:00:40.929 --> 01:00:44.690
In Isaiah chapter 60, verse 22,

01:00:44.690 --> 01:00:49.289
there's this prophecy that was foretold

01:00:49.289 --> 01:00:52.780
and it says,

01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:55.739
the little one will become 1,000

01:00:55.739 --> 01:00:58.539
and the small one, a mighty nation.

01:00:58.539 --> 01:01:01.780
I myself, Jehovah, will speed it up in its own time.

01:01:03.139 --> 01:01:04.900
Who is that mighty nation?

01:01:06.139 --> 01:01:10.659
It's the great crowd and the anointed together.

01:01:10.659 --> 01:01:15.460
They constitute a combined mighty nation.

01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:16.980
Although they are relatively few

01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:19.940
when compared to the present total world population

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:24.940
of more than 7.5 billion as of March this year.

01:01:27.289 --> 01:01:31.889
Many who visit us at Warwick, Walkill or Patterson say,

01:01:31.889 --> 01:01:34.489
oh, you live here like in Paradise

01:01:34.489 --> 01:01:36.690
and those saying this may have in mind

01:01:36.690 --> 01:01:39.809
the loving fellowship that we enjoy

01:01:39.809 --> 01:01:42.730
and also the beautiful surroundings.

01:01:42.730 --> 01:01:47.090
And the fact is that we do live in a Paradise,

01:01:47.090 --> 01:01:50.130
a spiritual Paradise.

01:01:50.170 --> 01:01:51.690
But what about you visitors

01:01:51.690 --> 01:01:53.650
and all those who are watching this program

01:01:53.650 --> 01:01:55.449
by streaming and otherwise?

01:01:56.610 --> 01:02:01.610
The good news is, you are also in the spiritual Paradise.

01:02:01.849 --> 01:02:04.889
All our worldwide brotherhood lives

01:02:04.889 --> 01:02:07.449
in this spiritual Paradise.

01:02:08.610 --> 01:02:10.690
Now what is the spiritual Paradise?

01:02:11.769 --> 01:02:14.849
It involves our relationship with Jehovah.

01:02:14.849 --> 01:02:16.769
It involves the spiritual food

01:02:16.769 --> 01:02:19.690
that we enjoy searched by the faithful's laity.

01:02:19.690 --> 01:02:21.849
It also involves the loving relationship

01:02:21.849 --> 01:02:24.010
with our brothers in the congregation

01:02:24.010 --> 01:02:26.530
and our worldwide brotherhood.

01:02:26.530 --> 01:02:29.610
It includes personal blessings from Jehovah

01:02:29.610 --> 01:02:33.650
that he bestows upon us in everyday life.

01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:37.250
The spiritual Paradise is the secure, spiritually

01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:40.730
prosperous environment or realm of activity

01:02:40.730 --> 01:02:43.369
in which we worship Jehovah.

01:02:43.369 --> 01:02:45.289
No matter where we live on Earth,

01:02:45.289 --> 01:02:48.690
we are in this Paradise as long

01:02:48.690 --> 01:02:51.929
as we actively support the worship of Jehovah

01:02:51.929 --> 01:02:55.010
and Endeavour to display the new personality.

01:02:56.250 --> 01:03:00.610
The spiritual Paradise began in a limited way

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:04.369
in 33 of our common era at Pentecost.

01:03:04.369 --> 01:03:06.929
It underwent changes during the centuries

01:03:06.929 --> 01:03:10.369
but was restored in 1919.

01:03:10.369 --> 01:03:13.929
The spiritual Paradise relates to the divine approval

01:03:14.210 --> 01:03:18.409
of the anointed that became evident that year 1919.

01:03:19.409 --> 01:03:21.730
In comparison with the first century,

01:03:21.730 --> 01:03:26.170
the anointed enjoy increased spiritual prosperity

01:03:26.170 --> 01:03:27.409
since that time.

01:03:28.969 --> 01:03:33.969
And since 1930s, those with an earthly hope

01:03:34.889 --> 01:03:37.769
also entered the spiritual Paradise.

01:03:37.769 --> 01:03:39.809
And ultimately, the spiritual Paradise

01:03:39.809 --> 01:03:43.329
will be in full existence and perfection

01:03:43.369 --> 01:03:44.570
in the new world.

01:03:45.690 --> 01:03:59.460
Do we appreciate that spiritual Paradise?

01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:03.619
Satan will try to destroy our spiritual Paradise.

01:04:03.619 --> 01:04:07.260
He thinks he can succeed because we seem vulnerable.

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:11.780
He may try to disrupt the flow of spiritual food

01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:13.420
or break up our unity,

01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:15.860
or stop us from zealously preaching

01:04:15.860 --> 01:04:19.219
all elements of the spiritual Paradise.

01:04:19.219 --> 01:04:20.820
Through political governments,

01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:23.739
he will try to face true worshipers

01:04:23.739 --> 01:04:26.139
and true worship from the earth.

01:04:26.139 --> 01:04:28.579
But he will not succeed.

01:04:28.579 --> 01:04:32.179
He will be thrown into an abyss for thousand years

01:04:32.179 --> 01:04:35.219
and after that he will be crushed out of existence.

01:04:36.179 --> 01:04:39.860
What about the governments that he controls now?

01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:43.820
They will already be crushed in Armageddon forever.

01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:48.460
The Messianic Kingdom will take control of the earth

01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:53.300
that eventually will become a perfect literal Paradise

01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:55.699
and then the spiritual Paradise

01:04:55.699 --> 01:05:02.329
and the physical Paradise will exist concurrently.

01:05:02.329 --> 01:05:04.570
The expansion of the spiritual Paradise

01:05:04.570 --> 01:05:09.369
since 1919 was paralleled by material expansion.

01:05:09.369 --> 01:05:12.210
Let me take you back on history lane.

01:05:12.210 --> 01:05:16.489
First, let's talk about our printing efforts.

01:05:16.489 --> 01:05:21.730
1920, we started with a rotary press at Middle Avenue, New York.

01:05:21.730 --> 01:05:27.969
1922, the printer was relocated to 18 Concord Street.

01:05:27.969 --> 01:05:32.210
From 1987 to 1986,

01:05:32.210 --> 01:05:38.690
additional printer buildings were bought and erected on Adam Street.

01:05:38.690 --> 01:05:42.530
But what about residence and office expansion?

01:05:42.530 --> 01:05:46.690
On October 10, 1960, there was a dedication

01:05:46.690 --> 01:05:53.010
of a new residence and office building at the 107 Columbia Heights.

01:05:53.010 --> 01:05:58.489
630 brothers attended in the ground floor Kingdom Hall.

01:05:58.489 --> 01:06:01.170
The new building, Brother France, said,

01:06:01.170 --> 01:06:03.769
reminds us of the psalmist words

01:06:03.769 --> 01:06:10.650
that everyone in Jehovah's Temple would speak his glory.

01:06:10.650 --> 01:06:14.889
1969, the 119 Columbia Heights Residence

01:06:14.889 --> 01:06:18.530
was built and dedicated on May 2.

01:06:18.530 --> 01:06:21.449
In the same year, a complex was bought from

01:06:21.449 --> 01:06:23.849
squib and suns pharmaceutical

01:06:23.849 --> 01:06:26.489
and it served as world headquarters

01:06:26.489 --> 01:06:29.170
until we moved here to Warwick.

01:06:29.170 --> 01:06:32.769
The address was 2530 Columbia Heights

01:06:32.769 --> 01:06:37.929
and it was dedicated on March 15, 1982.

01:06:37.929 --> 01:06:43.570
Later, buildings number 48 and 50 were also joined

01:06:43.570 --> 01:06:46.730
to the number 30 building.

01:06:46.730 --> 01:06:50.969
Close by is the 85 J Street Lot,

01:06:50.969 --> 01:06:55.250
a whole city block that was used for parking.

01:06:55.250 --> 01:07:02.090
Then September 18, 1995, there was another important dedication program.

01:07:02.090 --> 01:07:07.730
17 residences had been added since the previous dedication

01:07:07.730 --> 01:07:12.610
of the Bethel Residence on May 2, 1969.

01:07:12.610 --> 01:07:16.250
Among the added residences, there was the Towers Hotel

01:07:16.250 --> 01:07:19.730
that we bought in 1975, the Boston Hotel,

01:07:19.730 --> 01:07:26.570
Standys Hotel, Slyver Building, the 108-Joura-Lemen Building,

01:07:26.570 --> 01:07:32.369
the 30-story San Street Building and the 97 Columbia Heights Building

01:07:32.449 --> 01:07:38.449
formerly, there was the Margaret Hotel on the property.

01:07:38.449 --> 01:07:40.929
The 360-Fermans Street Building,

01:07:40.929 --> 01:07:45.050
which housed our shipping department and some other departments,

01:07:45.050 --> 01:07:52.849
was purchased by us on March 15, 1983 and totally renovated.

01:07:52.849 --> 01:07:59.130
It had a million square feet of floor space.

01:07:59.170 --> 01:08:04.329
As of this date, most of our properties almost all of them

01:08:04.329 --> 01:08:09.090
have been already sold and this more than covered the expenses

01:08:09.090 --> 01:08:12.809
needed to build headquarters here.

01:08:12.809 --> 01:08:17.600
Excuse me?

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:21.439
Well, what about expansion at Wal-Kill?

01:08:21.439 --> 01:08:27.479
In 1963, the farm at Wal-Kill was purchased from brothers.

01:08:27.479 --> 01:08:31.239
75 miles or 120 kilometers away from New York.

01:08:31.239 --> 01:08:35.079
New residence buildings were completed in 1968,

01:08:35.079 --> 01:08:37.920
71 and 73.

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:44.399
A large printer was eventually built, 73 and expanded in 1975.

01:08:44.399 --> 01:08:47.920
In 2004, printing in New York was discontinued

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:51.840
and all printing was consolidated at Wal-Kill.

01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:56.319
On May 15, 2005, there was the dedication program

01:08:56.319 --> 01:09:02.520
for the expanded Wal-Kill complex and facilities.

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:06.359
Today, we also dedicate a new residence,

01:09:06.359 --> 01:09:10.439
new parking garage and new office building at Wal-Kill,

01:09:10.439 --> 01:09:15.399
as well as the Montgomery Warehouse and two nearby hotels

01:09:15.399 --> 01:09:19.600
and diners that you have seen before in the video.

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:23.560
Wal-Kill has become the national headquarters

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:26.159
for the United States branch.

01:09:26.159 --> 01:09:30.439
And most of the branch committee members live at Wal-Kill.

01:09:30.439 --> 01:09:36.079
Warwick is the worldwide headquarters, so that's the difference.

01:09:36.079 --> 01:09:41.439
But there was also a complex built-ed Patterson in the mid-1990s

01:09:41.439 --> 01:09:46.359
with offices, residences, and theocratic schools.

01:09:46.359 --> 01:09:51.239
And on May 17 and following days, 1999

01:09:51.239 --> 01:09:55.279
was the dedication program.

01:09:55.279 --> 01:10:00.000
Recently, the Mount Ibo video studios on Route 22,

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.960
close to Patterson, were added and another building.

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:11.239
Now, Patterson is also considered as part of world headquarters.

01:10:11.239 --> 01:10:15.680
Also, the Tuxedo building that we bought from a paper company

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:18.479
and where our broadcasting studio is now

01:10:18.479 --> 01:10:21.199
is part of world headquarters.

01:10:21.199 --> 01:10:24.159
It's situated just about 10 minutes from here

01:10:24.159 --> 01:10:26.600
on the same country road.

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:30.760
Finally, we also dedicated the river crest, a complex that

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:34.960
was bought at Fiskill, where several hundred specialized

01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:36.479
live.

01:10:36.479 --> 01:10:40.520
Today, we will focus on the dedication of our beautiful world

01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:43.439
headquarters, complex at Warwick.

01:10:43.439 --> 01:10:46.199
Now, why was it built here?

01:10:46.199 --> 01:10:49.479
Well, we trust that it was Jehovah that

01:10:49.479 --> 01:10:53.840
wanted us to build it here.

01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:56.039
Well, what we learned from ancient times

01:10:56.039 --> 01:11:01.600
is that according to 2nd Kings, 2327, that Jehovah

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:06.720
was the one who chose Jerusalem as a center of worship.

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:09.399
And in our time, our world headquarters

01:11:09.399 --> 01:11:13.399
is a center that promotes true worship worldwide.

01:11:13.399 --> 01:11:18.939
And we believe it was chosen by Jehovah.

01:11:18.939 --> 01:11:22.699
All the expansion that we talked about glorifies Jehovah.

01:11:22.699 --> 01:11:24.819
The Apostle Paul had the right attitude.

01:11:24.819 --> 01:11:27.020
He wrote in 1 Thessalonians 2 6,

01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:30.060
nor have we been seeking glory from men.

01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:35.539
Yes, we seek Jehovah's glory, not our own glory.

01:11:35.539 --> 01:11:37.539
He is the one that caused and blessed

01:11:37.539 --> 01:11:40.140
the construction of our complexes.

01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:42.460
I'm sure you agree.

01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:45.100
Jehovah is the one who blessed the rebuilding

01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:49.100
of the physical temple in the times of the rubble.

01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:53.619
And Jehovah said back then, according to I say, 60 verse 7,

01:11:53.619 --> 01:11:58.539
I will beautify my glorious house.

01:11:58.539 --> 01:12:01.220
Now, the prophecy about the glorious house

01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:05.500
in our time refers not to the literal structures

01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:12.079
of world headquarters, but to our spiritual temple.

01:12:12.079 --> 01:12:15.119
Many would come, according to prophecy,

01:12:15.119 --> 01:12:18.319
and worship in that spiritual temple.

01:12:18.319 --> 01:12:23.319
It is a figurative house of prayer for all the nations,

01:12:23.319 --> 01:12:27.399
according to Isaiah 56 verse 7.

01:12:27.399 --> 01:12:31.600
Revelation 7.9 prophesies about a great crowd out

01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:33.840
of all the nations.

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:37.279
Now, what is their role and position?

01:12:37.279 --> 01:12:51.109
Well, let's look at it in the Bible in Revelation 7.

01:12:51.109 --> 01:12:57.229
And in verse 9, it says, after this I saw and looked

01:12:57.229 --> 01:13:00.949
a great crowd, which no man was able to number

01:13:00.949 --> 01:13:04.670
out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues,

01:13:04.670 --> 01:13:08.350
standing before the throne and before the land,

01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:11.550
dressed in white robes, and there were palm branches

01:13:11.590 --> 01:13:14.590
in their hands.

01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:18.829
It says that they stand before the throne of God.

01:13:18.829 --> 01:13:22.470
Does this mean that they go to heaven?

01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:23.390
No.

01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:27.189
The earth is called God's footstool.

01:13:27.189 --> 01:13:29.710
Isaiah 66 verse 1.

01:13:29.710 --> 01:13:32.670
So even on earth, the great crowd stands

01:13:32.670 --> 01:13:36.109
before the throne of Jehovah.

01:13:36.109 --> 01:13:38.069
The great crowd consists of Christians

01:13:38.069 --> 01:13:41.229
with the hope to live forever and paradise on earth.

01:13:41.229 --> 01:13:43.909
Revelation 7.15 says about them.

01:13:43.909 --> 01:13:47.350
They are rendering him sacred service day and night

01:13:47.350 --> 01:13:52.350
where in front of the temple, no, it says, in his temple.

01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:59.829
Where exactly is the great crowd serving?

01:13:59.829 --> 01:14:02.229
Yes, all of us, no matter what hope we have,

01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:05.869
served Jehovah in the spiritual temple,

01:14:05.869 --> 01:14:11.189
because we all worship Jehovah based on Jesus' sacrifice.

01:14:11.229 --> 01:14:14.270
So what is the spiritual temple?

01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:15.430
True or false?

01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:20.069
It's the same as the spiritual paradise, false?

01:14:20.069 --> 01:14:25.829
Or it refers to a 90 Christians, false again.

01:14:25.829 --> 01:14:30.149
The temples in Biber Times constituted a provision

01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:33.750
or arrangement of worshipping Jehovah.

01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:38.789
So the spiritual temple is also an arrangement of worship

01:14:38.829 --> 01:14:42.109
based on Jesus' perfect ransom sacrifice,

01:14:42.109 --> 01:14:45.550
and all that worship Jehovah based on his sacrifice

01:14:45.550 --> 01:14:48.630
are in the spiritual temple.

01:14:48.630 --> 01:14:52.989
Now, the spiritual paradise, on the other hand,

01:14:52.989 --> 01:14:58.510
refers to a condition that allows us to serve Jehovah

01:14:58.510 --> 01:15:03.350
with his approval and in peace with our brothers.

01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:06.670
We can enhance the beauty of the spiritual paradise

01:15:06.670 --> 01:15:10.029
and extend its borders by making disciples

01:15:10.029 --> 01:15:14.270
and also by displaying the Christian personality.

01:15:14.270 --> 01:15:15.750
All in the spiritual paradise,

01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:17.869
seeing Jehovah's praise without let up,

01:15:17.869 --> 01:15:19.989
it is as if they preach day and night.

01:15:19.989 --> 01:15:22.550
I say, 62, 6 goes on to say,

01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:25.909
continuously all day long and all night long,

01:15:25.909 --> 01:15:27.869
they should not be silent.

01:15:27.869 --> 01:15:33.390
You who make mention of Jehovah do not rest.

01:15:33.470 --> 01:15:36.949
As we are determined not to be silent,

01:15:36.949 --> 01:15:39.630
not to rest mentioning Jehovah.

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:45.189
In chapter 6, 6 in Isaiah,

01:15:45.189 --> 01:15:49.310
we read, they will proclaim the praises of Jehovah

01:15:49.310 --> 01:15:52.229
by preaching the good news and our expressions

01:15:52.229 --> 01:15:53.029
in Kingdom Halls.

01:15:53.029 --> 01:15:56.390
We all contribute to Jehovah's praise.

01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:59.750
Praising Jehovah is one of the primary objectives

01:15:59.750 --> 01:16:02.829
of our meeting attendance and our preaching activity.

01:16:03.550 --> 01:16:06.229
We understand that we do not primarily preach

01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:08.149
to save people's lives.

01:16:09.350 --> 01:16:11.430
Jehovah's praise is more important

01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:13.510
than the salvation of people.

01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:14.350
Why?

01:16:14.350 --> 01:16:16.510
Because Jehovah is more important than people.

01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:21.989
In Hebrews 13, verse 15, it says,

01:16:21.989 --> 01:16:23.710
through him Christ,

01:16:23.710 --> 01:16:28.710
let us always offer to God a sacrifice of praise.

01:16:29.869 --> 01:16:31.869
That is the fruit of our lips

01:16:31.869 --> 01:16:36.619
that make public declaration to his name.

01:16:36.619 --> 01:16:38.619
Nobody can stop the expansion.

01:16:39.619 --> 01:16:41.300
Even dictatorial governments,

01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:42.859
including communist governments,

01:16:42.859 --> 01:16:46.380
could not stop the expansion of God's organization.

01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:49.260
Hitler could not, Stalin could not,

01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:53.260
Trujillo in the Dominican Republic, Republic,

01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:56.699
could not Mussolini in Italy, could not,

01:16:56.699 --> 01:16:59.340
Turchesco of Romania, could not,

01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:02.020
Mao Zedun, could not,

01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:06.140
and the Hodja dictator of communist Albania could not.

01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:10.020
Nobody can, because Jehovah is with us.

01:17:11.539 --> 01:17:13.260
What about the former Soviet Union

01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:18.260
that included Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, and Russia?

01:17:19.939 --> 01:17:24.619
In 1991, there were less than 50,000 publishers

01:17:24.619 --> 01:17:27.220
in the former Soviet Union.

01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:32.220
Now, they are approaching 400,000 publishers.

01:17:32.619 --> 01:17:37.180
Imagine that increase of expansion.

01:17:37.180 --> 01:17:41.739
Within the period of 1991 to 1998,

01:17:41.739 --> 01:17:46.420
a total of 220,492 were baptized

01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:48.020
in the former Soviet Union.

01:17:48.939 --> 01:17:52.859
In 1990, in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine,

01:17:52.859 --> 01:17:55.180
there was just one congregation.

01:17:55.180 --> 01:17:57.779
Now, there are about 75.

01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:03.779
1993 saw the largest baptism of true Christians ever.

01:18:03.779 --> 01:18:08.100
It happened also in Kiev, Ukraine, at the convention.

01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:11.380
7,402 were baptized.

01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:16.140
Restrictions cannot stop the work.

01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:17.899
Jehovah promised,

01:18:17.899 --> 01:18:20.859
I will oppose those who oppose you

01:18:20.859 --> 01:18:24.060
and I will save my own sons.

01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:27.539
I say, 49,24,25.

01:18:29.140 --> 01:18:31.300
Shortly before Armageddon prophecy shows

01:18:31.300 --> 01:18:34.180
we will be attacked by a coalition of nations

01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:39.180
or governments directed by Satan and the demons.

01:18:39.939 --> 01:18:42.060
We do not need to fear, though,

01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:45.699
Jehovah will protect his people during the great tribulation

01:18:45.699 --> 01:18:47.779
and it stands to reason

01:18:47.779 --> 01:18:51.100
that he will also protect the physical headquarters.

01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:54.619
In Zechariah 2.8, he says,

01:18:54.619 --> 01:18:58.659
whoever touches you touches the pupil of my eye.

01:18:59.659 --> 01:19:01.460
Zechariah 2.5,

01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:03.859
and I will become to her, Declare, Jehovah,

01:19:03.859 --> 01:19:08.060
a wall of fire all around in protection

01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:13.399
and I will become the glory in her midst.

01:19:13.399 --> 01:19:17.319
Yes, our headquarters bring glory to Jehovah.

01:19:18.279 --> 01:19:21.920
These headquarters facilities and related buildings

01:19:22.039 --> 01:19:25.039
were built to glorify and praise Jehovah.

01:19:25.039 --> 01:19:28.880
I say, 43, 21 says,

01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:33.880
the people whom I formed for myself, what for?

01:19:34.279 --> 01:19:38.439
So that they might declare my praise.

01:19:38.439 --> 01:19:42.640
I say, 43, 21, go to remember the text.

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:46.600
It shows that the purpose of Jehovah has formed us

01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:51.600
as his people is to glorify and praise him.

01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:56.840
And so what is the purpose of the Christian congregation,

01:19:56.840 --> 01:20:00.600
general, well, again, to bring praise to Jehovah?

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:03.680
What's the purpose of four-week headquarters

01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:05.680
to praise Jehovah?

01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:09.239
Ephesians 1, 12 encourages us to serve

01:20:09.239 --> 01:20:11.359
for the praise of his glory.

01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:15.960
May this new complex and the other buildings

01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:21.159
that we dedicate today glorify and praise our dear Heavenly Father,

01:20:21.159 --> 01:20:22.800
Jehovah.

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:26.680
It is appropriate now that we say a dedication prayer

01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:31.279
to dedicate all buildings that have not been dedicated yet.

01:20:31.279 --> 01:20:34.560
And Brother Leon Viver, who serves on the branch committee

01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:47.350
in the United States, will now represent us in prayer.

01:20:47.350 --> 01:20:49.630
With this prayer and your consent,

01:20:49.630 --> 01:20:52.189
I now declare all our new buildings

01:20:52.189 --> 01:20:54.510
as dedicated to Jehovah.

01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:58.310
And we thank all of you for your contributions

01:20:58.350 --> 01:21:02.670
in various ways, manual labor, financial contributions,

01:21:02.670 --> 01:21:04.390
and prayers.

01:21:05.949 --> 01:21:09.829
Now, what is the opposite of a day of small beginnings?

01:21:10.949 --> 01:21:12.670
The day of a big finish?

01:21:12.670 --> 01:21:16.829
Well, is the dedication of our headquarters

01:21:16.829 --> 01:21:19.029
the big finish or ending?

01:21:19.829 --> 01:21:21.869
No ending is in sight.

01:21:21.869 --> 01:21:23.670
It is all relative.

01:21:23.670 --> 01:21:25.989
In the new world, we might even consider

01:21:25.989 --> 01:21:30.350
the dedication of warwick as a small beginning.

01:21:30.350 --> 01:21:34.069
In comparison, with a huge work that will be accomplished

01:21:34.069 --> 01:21:37.350
in paradise to teach billions,

01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:39.750
because billions will be resurrected.

01:21:41.350 --> 01:21:45.029
Isaiah 119 says, the earth will certainly be filled

01:21:45.029 --> 01:21:51.310
with the knowledge of Jehovah as the waters cover the sea.

01:21:51.310 --> 01:21:56.310
Yes, we have a glorious God and a Jehovah has a glorious name.

01:21:57.550 --> 01:21:59.390
We have a glorious good news

01:21:59.390 --> 01:22:02.069
and we have a glorious hope for the future.

01:22:02.989 --> 01:22:06.069
When Solomon inaugurated the temple,

01:22:06.069 --> 01:22:08.949
the glory of Jehovah filled the house.

01:22:08.949 --> 01:22:11.390
Today, the spiritual temple

01:22:11.390 --> 01:22:16.390
in which millions of us find themselves in

01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:19.310
is also filled with Jehovah's glory.

01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:25.390
In Isaiah 26 verse 12, it says,

01:22:25.710 --> 01:22:33.689
Old Jehovah, you will grant us peace

01:22:33.970 --> 01:22:38.090
because everything we have done,

01:22:38.090 --> 01:22:41.489
you have accomplished for us.

01:22:41.489 --> 01:22:45.369
Yeah, we want to give credit and praise to Jehovah God.

01:22:46.489 --> 01:22:49.210
Even oposes come to realize that

01:22:49.210 --> 01:22:53.050
Jehovah's blessing was involved in the construction.

01:22:53.050 --> 01:22:56.770
As was the case in the days of Nehemiah.

01:22:57.369 --> 01:23:01.250
In 616 says, they realized the oposers

01:23:01.250 --> 01:23:06.090
that it was with our God's help that this work had been done.

01:23:07.409 --> 01:23:11.010
And this is in line with 1st Peter 4, 11,

01:23:11.010 --> 01:23:14.850
so that in all things, God may be glorified

01:23:14.850 --> 01:23:18.609
through Jesus Christ, the glory and the might

01:23:18.609 --> 01:23:22.810
are his forever and ever amen.

01:23:22.810 --> 01:23:26.409
Revelation 5, 13 agrees with this, saying,

01:23:26.409 --> 01:23:29.569
To the one sitting on the throne

01:23:29.569 --> 01:23:32.010
and to the Lamb be the blessing

01:23:32.010 --> 01:23:37.010
and the honor and the glory and the might forever and ever.

01:23:38.210 --> 01:23:51.300
Hallelujah.

01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:52.859
Thank you very much, Brother Lush,

01:23:52.859 --> 01:23:55.939
for helping us to focus on the real meaning

01:23:55.939 --> 01:24:00.460
of the dedication of these facilities.

01:24:00.460 --> 01:24:03.220
The thousands that attended in person

01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:04.819
are retired in for that event,

01:24:04.819 --> 01:24:07.699
thoroughly enjoyed the dedication program.

01:24:07.939 --> 01:24:10.500
And now millions more of you have been able

01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:12.819
to enjoy the same experience.

01:24:12.819 --> 01:24:14.899
Well, I know, I know you can't wait

01:24:14.899 --> 01:24:17.100
to see the rest of the program.

01:24:17.100 --> 01:24:19.500
So I'm happy to inform you that the spiritual portion

01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:21.500
of the annual meeting program

01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:23.220
will be posted later this month

01:24:23.220 --> 01:24:25.380
and two installments on the video

01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:27.020
on demand section of our site.

01:24:27.979 --> 01:24:31.180
Part two will be posted on Monday, January 15th.

01:24:32.140 --> 01:24:35.699
Part three is to be posted on Monday, January 29th.

01:24:35.699 --> 01:24:37.020
So by the end of the month,

01:24:37.020 --> 01:24:39.100
you will have heard talks from five members

01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:40.220
of the governing body.

01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:44.500
We are well fed spiritually, that is for sure.

01:24:45.579 --> 01:24:48.340
Well, that's all for now.

01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:51.619
This program is from the studio of JW Broadcasting

01:24:51.619 --> 01:24:54.500
at the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses.
