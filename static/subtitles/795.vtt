00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:16.910
It has become customary in the last few years at annual meetings to have talks that reflect

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.269
clarifications in our understanding of the Scriptures.

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:24.390
And this annual meeting is no exception.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.550
We're going to have some solid spiritual food presented to us.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.869
And so we're going to listen with pleasure as Brother Steve Lett develops an intriguing

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:41.070
theme when was the Babylonian exile?

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:49.880
Listen, how would you answer that question?

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.520
You probably would say that's an easy question.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:06.359
The Babylonian exile went from 607 to 537 BCE and your answer would be correct.

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:11.120
In fact, we'd have to give you a gold star for that answer.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:21.120
As Jehovah's prophets had warned, Jehovah punished the unfaithful Israelites with exile.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.239
He sent them into a 70-year exile in Babylon.

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:30.159
But at the end of that exile period, what happened?

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.159
We'll open up to Isaiah chapter 52.

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:40.239
And let's notice that these words of Jehovah's prophet were fulfilled.

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:46.079
These words were said to those Israelites who were now being released.

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:58.239
Isaiah 52 verse 11, turn away, turn away, get out of there, touch nothing unclean.

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:08.840
Get out from the midst of her, keep yourselves clean, you who are carrying the utensils of Jehovah.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.840
Yes, Jehovah's people were liberated from Babylon.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.400
But now we ask this question, was this the only Babylonian exile?

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.680
Well, please go to Revelation chapter 18.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:31.280
I'm very familiar scripture here, but you're going to notice there is a similar command to Jehovah's people.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.919
As the one we read in Isaiah, notice Revelation 18 verse 4.

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:46.680
And I heard another voice out of heaven say, get out of her, my people.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:54.599
If you do not want to share with her in her sins, and if you do not want to receive part of her plagues.

00:02:54.599 --> 00:03:01.000
Now, the her is identified back in verse number two as being Bab in the great.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:15.840
So clearly, the Apostle John writing in the first century CE was talking about a yet future Babylonian exile and liberation of Jehovah's people.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:24.759
And this Babylonian exile would be much more far reaching than the one we talked about in the outset of our discussion.

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:29.960
Because Bab in the great is no mere Mesopotamian city.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.840
It is no mere political world power.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:41.639
In fact, Bab in the great has outlasted all of the seven political world powers combined,

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:46.000
at least from the time of Nimrod until today.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.759
So what is this Babylon the great?

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:57.960
Well, as you know, it's the satanic world encompassing empire of false religion.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:08.599
And the liberation of God's people from this Babylon and the restoration of true worship would even be better good news than the

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:14.560
liberation restoration that took place in 537 BCE.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.800
But here's the million dollar question.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.639
And you're going to find this truly fascinating when we discuss it.

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:28.600
When was this greater Babylonian exile?

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.800
What time period did it occupy?

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.360
Now, to get the answer to that, we're going to address four questions.

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:43.959
The first question, what have our publications taught on this subject until now?

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:49.920
The second question, why is there a need for an adjustment?

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.079
Number three, what's our new understanding?

00:04:53.079 --> 00:05:00.160
And number four, how does this new understanding harmonize with other Bible prophecies?

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.519
Now, let's get that first question.

00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:06.720
What have our publications taught until now?

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:16.800
Well, for many years, our publications have taught that the anointed were sent into exile

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:23.279
in Babylon the great during the troubled years of World War I.

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:32.959
At one point, we said the exile lasted from 1914 through 1918.

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:41.560
More recently, we have said, they went from the dark year 1918 to 1919.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.680
But the governing body, and we really feel under the direction of Jehovah's spirit,

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.360
has recently undertaken a careful, prayerful study of this subject

00:05:52.360 --> 00:06:01.480
and have come to the conclusion that an adjustment in our understanding is definitely needed.

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:08.319
But now, that brings us to the second question, why is there a need for an adjustment?

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:11.160
Why do we need to make an adjustment?

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:17.040
Well, here's the question that especially moved the governing body to come to that conclusion.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:26.639
The question, did Jehovah really punish the anointed of the 1914 to 1919 era

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:31.000
with spiritual exile in Babylon the great?

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.319
Did he punish them this way?

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:41.480
Well, in regard to that, think again about the Babylonian exile we talked about at the beginning.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:47.360
Why was it that Jehovah sent his people into exile in 607?

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:54.600
It was to punish a rebellious, a wicked people,

00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:00.240
and it was only after Jehovah repeatedly gave warnings through his prophets

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:06.240
and they ignored those warnings that Jehovah sent them into exile.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.360
But now, please think for a moment about our anointed brothers and sisters

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.360
during the World War I era.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.199
Were they like that?

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:20.839
We could rebellious needing to be sent into exile.

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:21.920
Now, it's true.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:29.279
They didn't have a clear understanding of Christian neutrality like we have today.

00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:32.560
But they did the best they could with the understanding that they had.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:39.800
For example, they knew that you should not bear arms and harm others.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.120
So as conscientious objectors, many of them,

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:48.720
or if you used to have any share whatsoever in supporting the war effort,

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.959
others though lacking some understanding,

00:07:51.959 --> 00:07:56.120
agreed to accept non-combatant roles.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:00.600
A few were conscripted into the military,

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.199
and agreed to wear a uniform and carry a gun,

00:08:04.199 --> 00:08:07.800
but they would not use that gun to harm anyone.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:11.959
In an extreme situation where they had to shoot,

00:08:11.959 --> 00:08:15.319
they would simply aim into the air.

00:08:15.319 --> 00:08:21.680
On the home front, the Bible students were viciously persecuted,

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:28.439
arrested because of their denouncing Christmas role in the war.

00:08:28.439 --> 00:08:34.960
Now does that sound like a rebellious wicked people needing to be sent into exile?

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:40.080
In fact, our brothers and sisters of that period as a whole,

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.799
courageously took a stand against war and violence,

00:08:44.799 --> 00:08:48.360
no matter what the personal consequences were.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:53.440
So it's hard for us to imagine that Jehovah would have sent them into exile.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:09:00.039
I mean, what does Jeremiah 46 and verse 28 tell us about our wonderful God, Jehovah?

00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:06.440
It says he always disciplines to the proper degree.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:15.159
Furthermore, the evidence shows that Jehovah did not send the anointed off into Babylonian exile

00:09:15.159 --> 00:09:18.799
during those years to the contrary during that time.

00:09:18.799 --> 00:09:19.639
What were they doing?

00:09:19.639 --> 00:09:24.039
They were actively separating themselves from Babylon the Great.

00:09:24.039 --> 00:09:27.440
They were shedding false teachings,

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:33.960
and they were exposing false religion for being the frauds that they were.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.519
Well, likely our discussion thus far has helped you to appreciate

00:09:37.519 --> 00:09:43.200
why the governing body came to the conclusion that an adjustment

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:47.399
in our understanding is definitely needed.

00:09:47.399 --> 00:09:50.399
Now it brings us to our third question,

00:09:50.399 --> 00:09:56.200
what is our new understanding concerning the Babylonian exile?

00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.679
Well, let us begin first by telling you straight forwardly

00:10:00.679 --> 00:10:07.919
our new understanding as to when the Babylonian exile began.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:14.399
It began not in 1914, not in 1918,

00:10:14.399 --> 00:10:20.360
but sometime during the second century CE.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:25.240
Now let's repeat that sometime during the second century CE.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.240
But let's talk about why we say this.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.279
If you recall in the first century CE,

00:10:32.279 --> 00:10:37.840
Jesus and the apostles warned against the postates

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:41.879
and the corrupting influence that they could have on the Christian congregation.

00:10:41.879 --> 00:10:46.320
For example, at Matthew 7, verse 15, Jesus said,

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:53.159
be on the watch for the false prophets who come to you and sheep's covering.

00:10:53.159 --> 00:10:57.399
But inside they are ravenous wolves.

00:10:57.399 --> 00:10:59.120
So he warned, didn't he?

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:03.720
Or what about the Apostle Paul, Acts 20, 29 and 30?

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:07.360
He said, I know that after my going away,

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:11.799
oppressive wolves will enter in among you,

00:11:11.799 --> 00:11:15.039
will not treat the flock with tenderness,

00:11:15.039 --> 00:11:18.799
and men will arise and speak twisted things

00:11:18.799 --> 00:11:22.120
to draw away the disciples after themselves.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:25.080
So he was warning, see, against the postates.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.799
Or what about Jesus after he was resurrected?

00:11:28.799 --> 00:11:33.279
He gave warnings to the seven congregations in Asia Minor

00:11:33.279 --> 00:11:37.320
and included in the warnings, warnings against apostasy.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.559
For example, to the Pergamum congregation.

00:11:40.559 --> 00:11:44.320
In Revelation chapter 2, verses 14 through 16,

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.720
as an example, Jesus said,

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:50.039
I have a few things against you

00:11:50.039 --> 00:11:55.360
that you have there those adhering to the teaching of Balum.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.360
You also have those adhering to the teaching of the sect

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.039
of Nicolaius.

00:12:00.039 --> 00:12:05.039
So repent if you do not, I am coming to you quickly.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:11.120
And I will war against them with a long sword of my mouth.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.000
See, very strong warnings.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.879
But now the question is,

00:12:16.879 --> 00:12:20.559
were these warnings of Jesus and the Apostles,

00:12:20.559 --> 00:12:24.240
he did, sadly, no.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.360
In fact, increasingly,

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:30.960
the elders became more and more tolerant of apostates.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.639
What were the sad consequences

00:12:32.639 --> 00:12:37.360
by the end of the first century CE apostasy

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:41.799
was becoming rampant in the congregation.

00:12:41.799 --> 00:12:45.440
More and more men were slipping into the congregations

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:49.960
and turning the undeserved kindness of God into an excuse

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:54.960
for loose conduct or brazen conduct as we say now.

00:12:56.679 --> 00:13:00.080
After the death of the last of the Apostles,

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.320
who were acting as a restraint, what happened?

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.000
Well, the situation got even worse, didn't it?

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.799
Much worse.

00:13:06.799 --> 00:13:11.000
Imitation Christians now freely infiltrated

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.799
and just flourished in the congregation.

00:13:13.799 --> 00:13:18.519
And as these imitation Christians promoted themselves

00:13:18.519 --> 00:13:22.720
and compromised more and more with a secular authorities,

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.399
what happened?

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:29.440
And ugly, and I mean ugly baby was born.

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:38.629
That baby christened them.

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:42.629
And as that baby grew,

00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:47.629
it became uglier and uglier in Jehovah's eyes.

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:52.190
Gradually becoming the most reprehensible part

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:54.309
of Babylon the Great.

00:13:54.309 --> 00:13:56.549
So clearly it was then,

00:13:56.590 --> 00:14:00.389
sometime in the second century CE,

00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:05.429
that Christians were in effect taken off into exile

00:14:05.429 --> 00:14:06.870
in Babylon the Great.

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:11.669
However, during those dark centuries that followed,

00:14:11.669 --> 00:14:15.470
as we know there were always some fateful anointed Christians

00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:21.389
who sought Jehovah and they tried to promote Bible truths

00:14:21.909 --> 00:14:26.149
but Jehovah's time to end the long exile

00:14:26.149 --> 00:14:28.590
was not here yet.

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:30.309
But now that brings us to the question,

00:14:30.309 --> 00:14:33.789
when did this exile end?

00:14:33.789 --> 00:14:36.350
We established when it began,

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:39.750
it began sometime in the second century CE.

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:41.149
But now when did it end?

00:14:41.149 --> 00:14:44.669
Well, the answer, 1919,

00:14:44.669 --> 00:14:48.470
when true Christians were fully completely freed

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:50.710
from false religion.

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:52.389
Let's talk about why we say that.

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:57.750
During the 1800s, it became clear

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:01.149
that Jehovah's time for release

00:15:01.149 --> 00:15:04.750
and restoration of true worship was approaching.

00:15:05.629 --> 00:15:09.070
The Bible students were proving themselves to be very fateful

00:15:10.029 --> 00:15:14.470
and they were proving themselves to be in line for restoration.

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:17.110
They needed only a final refining.

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:22.830
And that took place from 1914 to 1918.

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:27.149
And that fulfilled Micah 4 verses one through three.

00:15:27.149 --> 00:15:28.830
Remember what it says there?

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:31.950
It says in the final part of the days,

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:34.909
the mountain of the house of Jehovah would be raised

00:15:34.909 --> 00:15:36.309
above the hills,

00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:40.710
people would stream to Jehovah's house

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:43.269
and Jehovah would instruct them in his ways.

00:15:43.269 --> 00:15:45.149
He would set matter straight

00:15:45.149 --> 00:15:48.669
and they would beat their swords in the plowshares.

00:15:48.669 --> 00:15:51.909
In fact, they wouldn't even learn more anymore.

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:58.230
Thus in 1919, with a release of prominent brothers

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:02.350
from prison, the time for full release

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:06.950
and restoration had finally arrived.

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:11.950
True Christians were at last and forever freed

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:15.710
from their long Babylonish exile.

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:19.870
But that brings us to our fourth and final question.

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:23.350
How does our new understanding harmonize

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:25.350
with other Bible prophecies?

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:27.870
Well, we'd just like to say this first

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:31.110
that when Jehovah refines our understanding

00:16:32.149 --> 00:16:35.389
and he does this in his own time, his own way,

00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:39.110
but when Jehovah does this, it's just simply amazing.

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:41.590
How that new understanding harmonizes

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:46.149
with the rest of the Bible, including Bible prophecies.

00:16:46.149 --> 00:16:49.269
It's kind of like the pieces of a puzzle

00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:52.669
of fitting together perfectly with each piece

00:16:52.669 --> 00:16:56.549
confirming and clarifying the other piece.

00:16:56.549 --> 00:16:59.350
So in this vein, we ask,

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:02.870
how does our new understanding harmonize

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:07.869
with azekious prophecy about the valley of dry bones?

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:14.630
Remember that prophecy in Ezeko chapter 37 versus 1 through 14?

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:19.190
If you recall, Ezekiel sees a valley

00:17:20.309 --> 00:17:23.950
that is full of quote,

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:28.950
very dry bones, according to verse number two.

00:17:29.269 --> 00:17:33.269
Later, Jehovah explains that this valley of dry bones

00:17:33.269 --> 00:17:35.349
represents the whole house of Israel.

00:17:35.349 --> 00:17:39.990
He tells Ezeko this in verse number 11,

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:43.430
but during the vision, Ezekiel, if you remember,

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:45.990
he sees the bones first begin to rattle.

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:51.549
And then the bones come together, bone to bone,

00:17:51.549 --> 00:17:56.549
and then sin you and flesh and skin are added.

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:59.470
And then finally in verse 10,

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:03.549
they come to life, stand on their feet

00:18:03.549 --> 00:18:07.710
and become an extremely large army.

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:11.789
Well, what was the first fulfillment of this prophecy?

00:18:12.589 --> 00:18:15.150
That valley of dried up bones

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:19.549
pictured the dead condition of the Jewish exiles

00:18:19.549 --> 00:18:21.509
in ancient Babylon.

00:18:21.509 --> 00:18:24.670
But Jehovah did this seemingly impossible.

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:26.670
He revived them, didn't he?

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:30.630
And he made them again a living, powerful army.

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:33.150
But now, what is the greater fulfillment?

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:35.390
And that's what we're especially interested in.

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:40.630
We can now see that this valley of very dry bones

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:45.630
well pictures the Christian congregation

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:50.309
during the centuries-long exile

00:18:50.309 --> 00:18:52.349
that we were talking about.

00:18:52.349 --> 00:18:57.349
See, like very dry bones, it seemed to be completely dead,

00:18:57.789 --> 00:19:02.789
spiritually dead, with no hope of ever reviving

00:19:03.549 --> 00:19:05.150
but then what happened?

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:08.150
In a gradual way, faithful Christians

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:10.750
began to revive spiritually.

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:13.509
Long before the days of Brother Russell

00:19:13.509 --> 00:19:17.950
and the Bible students, you could say there was a rattling sound

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:23.990
when a few brave Christians dared to translate the Bible

00:19:24.589 --> 00:19:27.069
into the languages of the common people.

00:19:28.269 --> 00:19:31.710
Then in the late 1800s,

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:34.029
as Brother Russell and his associates began

00:19:34.029 --> 00:19:38.869
to expose false teachings and champion Bible truths,

00:19:38.869 --> 00:19:41.710
it was as if bone was joining the bone.

00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:47.630
Acquiring flesh, sin you and skin.

00:19:48.069 --> 00:19:53.069
Finally, by 1919, faithful Christians were ready

00:19:53.069 --> 00:19:57.869
to be raised up as an organized army of preachers.

00:19:58.829 --> 00:20:01.710
So you can see from our little brief discussion here

00:20:02.509 --> 00:20:05.630
that our new understanding harmonizes beautifully,

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:11.869
perfectly, with a zekios prophecy of the valley of dry bones.

00:20:12.509 --> 00:20:14.990
But now we ask this question, how does our new understanding

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:18.750
harmonize with Jesus prophetic parable

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:24.190
about the wheat and the weeds in Matthew chapter 13?

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:28.109
If you recall, the master said it would be very hard

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:32.109
to distinguish between the wheat and the weeds.

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:36.269
So he told the reapers to wait until the end

00:20:37.069 --> 00:20:41.789
of the long-growing season to separate the two.

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:46.029
We now understand that that long-growing season

00:20:47.069 --> 00:20:51.630
is identical to the Babylonian exile.

00:20:52.589 --> 00:20:54.509
During the centuries, though, of course,

00:20:54.509 --> 00:20:57.710
they were always genuine Christians, genuine,

00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:00.349
anointed Christians, but they were lost, weren't they?

00:21:01.309 --> 00:21:05.869
They were indistinguishable from the imitation Christians

00:21:07.069 --> 00:21:12.349
who surrounded them in golfing them, you could say, in captivity.

00:21:13.309 --> 00:21:19.309
But after 1914, Christ followers were in the harvest season.

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:24.430
And when the harvest of the wheat got underway in 1919,

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:29.869
the distinction between the wheat and the weeds finally became clear.

00:21:30.349 --> 00:21:37.309
And ever since 1919, the harvest work has prospered more and more abundantly.

00:21:38.589 --> 00:21:44.190
Well, as we've now discussed, our new understanding certainly harmonizes

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:49.390
beautifully, perfectly, with Ezekiel's prophecy of the valley of the dry bones

00:21:50.509 --> 00:21:55.230
and Jesus' prophetic parable about the wheat and the weeds.

00:21:55.789 --> 00:22:02.029
So in conclusion, we say, is it not encouraging to think of Jehovah God

00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:06.269
freeing faithful Christians from bondage to false religion

00:22:06.269 --> 00:22:28.269
after more than 16 centuries of exile and how encouraging it is for us

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:35.390
to be part of Christ's organized army of preachers today?

00:22:36.109 --> 00:22:43.869
And what a delight it is to be able to help the angels by staying busy in the preaching work,

00:22:44.509 --> 00:22:50.190
helping still others to obey the command of Revelation 184

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:56.829
to get out of her, get out of Babin the Great, get out of false religion

00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:02.990
so that they do not share in her eternal destruction.

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:24.529
Oh, we continue in the book of Ezekiel, and I think you'll find this next part very encouraging.

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:31.009
It's entitled One Nation in the Hand of Jehovah. And as you can see,

00:23:31.009 --> 00:23:42.380
Mark Sanderson is going to deliver it. Unity, how marvelous it is to feel the unity in this room,

00:23:43.339 --> 00:23:52.299
but dear brothers, the unity that we experience today as God's people is not the result of human efforts.

00:23:53.259 --> 00:23:59.900
All the praise, all the glory, all the honor for what we experience on a day like this

00:24:00.539 --> 00:24:11.579
must go to the Almighty God, Jehovah. And certainly, this unity has not come about by accident.

00:24:12.619 --> 00:24:19.900
All of this was foretold in advance. And I'd like for you to open your Bibles with me, please.

00:24:20.539 --> 00:24:28.140
And let's consider together a fascinating prophecy regarding this matter of unity.

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:34.700
It's in Ezekiel, chapter 37, and we're going to begin reading in verse 16,

00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:48.289
and you, son of man, take a stick and write on it for Judah and for the people of Israel who are with him.

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:58.369
Then take another stick and write on it for Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and all the house of

00:24:58.369 --> 00:25:06.769
Israel who are with him. Then bring them close to each other so that they become just one stick in

00:25:06.769 --> 00:25:15.569
your hand. When your people say to you, will you not tell us what these things mean? Tell them,

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:23.970
this is what the sovereign Lord Jehovah says. I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:31.650
of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel who are with him, and I will join them to the stick of Judah,

00:25:32.529 --> 00:25:42.690
and I will make them one stick, and they will become one in my hand. The sticks that you write on

00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:51.730
should be in your hand for them to see. Then tell them, this is what the sovereign Lord Jehovah says.

00:25:52.849 --> 00:25:59.170
I will take the Israelites from among the nations where they have gone, and I will collect them

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:07.329
from every direction and bring them to their land. I will make them one nation in the land

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:16.450
on the mountains of Israel, and one king will rule over all of them, and they will no longer be two

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:24.450
nations, nor will they be divided any longer into two kingdoms. They will no longer defile themselves

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:30.609
with their disgusting idols, and their detestable practices in all their transgressions.

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:38.529
I will save them from all their unfaithfulness by which they have sined, and I will cleanse them.

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:47.650
They will be my people, and I myself will be their God. My servant David will be their king,

00:26:48.289 --> 00:26:56.049
and they will all have one shepherd. They will walk in my judicial decisions, and carefully observe

00:26:56.049 --> 00:27:03.970
my statutes. They will dwell on the land that I gave to my servant, to Jacob, where your forefathers

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:10.930
lived, and they will dwell on it forever. They and their children, and their children's children,

00:27:11.569 --> 00:27:18.849
and David my servant will be their chieftain forever, and I will make a covenant of peace with them.

00:27:19.569 --> 00:27:26.690
It will be an eternal covenant with them. I will establish them and make them many, and place my

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:35.410
sanctuary among them forever. My tent will be with them, and I will be their God, and they will be

00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:43.089
my people, and the nations will have to know that I, Jehovah, am sanctifying Israel,

00:27:43.089 --> 00:27:53.650
when my sanctuary is in their midst forever. Well, now, what is the meaning of this prophecy,

00:27:54.130 --> 00:28:02.369
and how was it fulfilled? Well, first, let's consider what did Jehovah instruct Ezekiel to do?

00:28:03.329 --> 00:28:13.650
Well, he told him to take two sticks, right on one for Judah, and on the other for Joseph,

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:22.849
the stick of Ephraim. Then Ezekiel was to bring the two sticks close together, so that they would

00:28:22.849 --> 00:28:31.089
become just one stick. Well, now, what did these actions of the prophet Ezekiel illustrate?

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:37.730
Well, now, dear brothers, we have not considered these prophecies for a long time,

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:43.569
and so I'm going to have to ask you to put on your Bible history caps for a few minutes,

00:28:44.529 --> 00:28:49.490
because we're going to go back over some of these things that we have not discussed for some years.

00:28:50.369 --> 00:28:56.609
Now, you'll remember that after the death of King Solomon, Israel was divided.

00:28:57.569 --> 00:29:05.329
Rehoboam became the king of the southern kingdom that was made up of two tribes with its capital in

00:29:05.329 --> 00:29:12.690
Jerusalem. The Davidic kings, those in the line of Judah, ruled over those two tribes.

00:29:13.569 --> 00:29:22.210
So, what did that stick of Judah represent? Well, yes, it represented those from the two tribe

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:31.410
kingdom of Judah. Jeroboam, on the other hand, became the first king of the northern ten tribe

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:41.730
kingdom of Israel. Well, now interestingly, what tribe did Jeroboam come from? He was from Ephraim,

00:29:42.289 --> 00:29:49.890
the dominant tribe of the northern ten tribe kingdom. You'll also remember that Ephraim

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:57.569
was the son of Joseph. So, what did that stick for Joseph, the stick of Ephraim refer to?

00:29:58.369 --> 00:30:04.529
Well, yes, it represented those who were from that northern ten tribe kingdom.

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:12.289
Well, now, what did Jerhova foretell with regard to these two different kingdoms? Well,

00:30:12.289 --> 00:30:18.529
Jerhova said, he was going to unite those from the two tribe kingdom and those from the ten

00:30:18.529 --> 00:30:27.890
tribe kingdom and they would become one in his hand. Well, now, brothers, why would many have

00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:35.490
doubted that this prophecy could actually come to fulfillment? Well, by the time that Ezekiel

00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:41.730
recorded this prophecy about the joining of the sticks, the people from the northern kingdom

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:49.250
had long ago been taken captive by the Assyrians. That had taken place in 740 BCE.

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:59.009
But then, in 607 BCE, the southern kingdom of Judah, and perhaps any ones who were left over

00:30:59.009 --> 00:31:05.410
in the land from the northern kingdom had all been taken into exile by the Babylonians.

00:31:06.289 --> 00:31:14.930
Well, from a human standpoint, it seemed impossible that Jerhova would be able to unify all of these

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:26.690
exiles into one nation. But what actually happened in the year 537 BCE? Well, let's open our

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:36.109
Bibles and let's look at 1 Chronicles chapter 9 in 1 Chronicles chapter 9 and verse 2.

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:44.750
Speaking here about those who were returning, it says the first inhabitants to return to their

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:52.910
possession in their cities were some Israelites, the priests, the Levites, and the temple servants,

00:31:53.549 --> 00:32:03.630
and some of the descendants of Judah, of Benjamin, of Ephraim, and of Manasseh settled in Jerusalem.

00:32:04.269 --> 00:32:14.589
Well, just as Jerhova had foretold representatives of both the two tribes, southern kingdom,

00:32:14.589 --> 00:32:22.190
and of that northern 10 tribe kingdom did return, and they were joined together in one nation.

00:32:22.829 --> 00:32:29.950
Just as Jerhova had said, it would happen. One now, brothers, that's all very interesting.

00:32:30.589 --> 00:32:37.730
But I know that's not what you're wondering about. What is the modern day fulfillment?

00:32:38.289 --> 00:32:46.049
How have these words been fulfilled in our time? Well, let's go back and look at Ezekiel chapter 37

00:32:46.049 --> 00:32:56.289
again, and let's look at verse 24. It says, my servant David will be their king, and they will all

00:32:56.289 --> 00:33:04.049
have one shepherd. They will walk in my judicial decisions and carefully observe my statutes.

00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:12.930
Well now, how would this be fulfilled? Well, who is this servant David that's referred to in

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:20.849
verse 24? Of course, this is talking about Jesus Christ and the time when he would begin to rule

00:33:21.329 --> 00:33:32.769
in 1914. And so the prophecy began to be fulfilled, especially from the year 1919. Why do we say that?

00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:39.809
Well, by that time, Jerhova's servants had been set free from Babylonish captivity,

00:33:40.529 --> 00:33:46.529
and now this prophecy regarding the two sticks would begin to be fulfilled.

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:54.769
Well, now what did the stick of Judah refer to in our modern day? What did it represent?

00:33:55.970 --> 00:34:04.210
Well, now let's think together. Jerusalem was located in Judah. What was the city known for?

00:34:04.769 --> 00:34:12.130
Well, of course, it was the city where the kings in the line of David ruled. But now what else was

00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:19.730
there in Jerusalem? Of course, it was Jehovah's Temple, where the Levitical priests carried out their

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:28.050
priestly duties. So now we have kings, we have priests. Now what does that bring to your mind?

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:36.050
Well, of course, that stick for Judah referred to the anointed ones, those who had the hope

00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:41.250
of reigning as kings with Christ Jesus and as serving as priests in the heavens.

00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:48.690
Well, now after Jehovah had brought together his anointed ones, he had cleansed them,

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:54.769
he had reorganized them. They had been completely set free from Babylonish captivity.

00:34:54.769 --> 00:35:02.849
Jehovah brought these anointed ones into complete unity of worship. But now brothers,

00:35:03.489 --> 00:35:13.329
does the prophecy end there? What had Jehovah foretold in the book of Zechariah, chapter 8?

00:35:13.329 --> 00:35:23.309
Now let's go in our Bibles and read this together. Zechariah, chapter 8, and verse 23,

00:35:23.309 --> 00:35:37.570
this is what Jehovah of army says. In those days, 10 men out of all the languages of the nations

00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:45.250
will take hold. Yes, they will take firmhold of the, aren't you glad that skirts gone?

00:35:46.289 --> 00:35:55.329
They will take firmhold of the robe of a Jew saying, we want to go with you, for we have heard that

00:35:55.329 --> 00:36:02.530
God is with you people. Well, now, how were these words to be fulfilled?

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:11.010
Men and women from all the nations were going to come forward and they were going to associate

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:19.969
themselves with the anointed remnant. And this would begin to appear after that time in 1919.

00:36:19.969 --> 00:36:30.849
Well, what do the facts demonstrate? The October 15, 1923 watchtower drew attention to a group who

00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:37.010
did not have the heavenly hope and who would live on earth during the time of Christ reign.

00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:46.289
Then in 1932, the watchtower discussed a class of people in modern times who Jehovah would take

00:36:46.289 --> 00:36:55.650
through Armageddon to live here on the earth. But it was in 1935 that there was a brilliant

00:36:55.730 --> 00:37:04.289
flash of light. At the convention in Washington, DC, the great multitude was identified not as a

00:37:04.289 --> 00:37:12.849
secondary heavenly class, but as an earthly class. Well, when the speaker, brother J.F.

00:37:12.849 --> 00:37:20.929
Rutherford said to the audience, will all those who have the hope of living forever on the earth

00:37:20.929 --> 00:37:28.849
please stare more than half of the audience rose to their feet. Brother Rutherford said,

00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:37.809
behold the great multitude. What an exciting moment that must have been for those brothers.

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:46.289
Well, now, how do these with the earthly hope fit in with this prophecy regarding the two sticks?

00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:56.130
Well, keep in mind, the Northern Kingdom had no Davidic kings. It had no Levitical priests.

00:37:57.250 --> 00:38:05.889
Therefore, brothers, we can now say with confidence that the stick of Joseph in our modern day

00:38:06.449 --> 00:38:14.849
represents the other sheep with an earthly hope. Jehovah has taken these two groups. His

00:38:14.849 --> 00:38:22.610
anointed servants and his precious other sheep. And he has brought them together within his

00:38:22.610 --> 00:38:33.409
almighty hand. They are no longer two sticks, but one stick, one nation in the hand of Jehovah.

00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:39.570
Now, brothers, I'm not going to do what brother Rutherford did. I'm not going to ask you all to

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:51.409
stand. But I would like for you to take a moment and look around this room. Behold one stick, one nation

00:38:51.409 --> 00:39:27.119
in the hand of Jehovah. Well, now, how does this understanding of Ezekiel's prophecy harmonize

00:39:27.119 --> 00:39:35.599
with other Bible prophecies? Well, right away, our mind goes to John chapter 10 and verse 16.

00:39:36.559 --> 00:39:48.380
What did Jesus say there? And I have other sheep, which are not of this fold. Those two I must bring

00:39:49.179 --> 00:39:59.420
and they will listen to my voice and they will become one flock, one shepherd, just as the prophecy

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:09.099
had stated in Ezekiel. But that's not all brothers. We also have to consider what was mentioned in

00:40:09.099 --> 00:40:19.699
verses 26 and verses 27 of Ezekiel chapter 37. You see there in verse 26, it says,

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:26.659
and I will make a covenant of peace with them. It will be an eternal covenant with them.

00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:33.619
I will establish them and will make them many and place my sanctuary among them forever.

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:42.820
My tent will be with them and I will be their God and they will be my people. Well, of course,

00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:49.539
where do our minds go? Right away to the words that were recorded some 700 years later in the book

00:40:49.539 --> 00:40:57.780
of Revelation chapter 7 when almost the same wording is used about Jehovah spreading his tent over

00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:06.579
them. But now there is one more place where we can see this harmony because a similar description

00:41:06.579 --> 00:41:12.820
of unity is found in Jesus illustrations that become a part of the sign of His presence.

00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:21.460
After referring to the faithful slave, Jesus gave two illustrations that apply primarily to those

00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:29.860
with a heavenly hope. But then, he foretold that those with an earthly hope would loyally support

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:38.579
the anointed ones sticking closely to them. As a result, today what do we see? Well, the anointed

00:41:38.579 --> 00:41:45.860
and the other sheep are working together unitedly as one nation in carrying out the disciple making

00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:55.300
and preaching work that Jesus himself began. So, in the modern day fulfillment of Ezekiel's prophecy,

00:41:55.940 --> 00:42:03.300
what has Jehovah accomplished? First, he gathered together his anointed worshipers,

00:42:04.019 --> 00:42:10.099
and later he brought together a great crowd of his other sheep into the fold.

00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:19.699
And now they are serving unitedly as one nation. How much brothers, this deepens our trust

00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:28.980
in Jehovah's protection. Satan the devil would love to destroy this beautiful unity that we have.

00:42:29.699 --> 00:42:36.579
But by Jehovah's undeserved kindness, he is not able to do so because where is this nation

00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:48.500
safely within his protective hand? Yes, brothers, unity. How precious it is. But remember,

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:58.260
this unity that we enjoy today is not the result of any human efforts. It is Jehovah that has brought

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:07.380
us together. It is Jehovah who has made us one. And it is no accident. The prophecy of Ezekiel 37

00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:16.019
shows that it is only by the direct action of God that this unity exists. Truly, brothers,

00:43:16.019 --> 00:43:25.059
may we never allow anything divisive to take away or to disturb our unity. But rather, may we treasure

00:43:25.059 --> 00:43:32.820
our place in this one nation in the hand of our magnificent God, Jehovah.

00:43:54.559 --> 00:44:02.559
Our final talk of the day is also on the book of Ezekiel. And it's going to be delivered by

00:44:02.559 --> 00:44:12.960
Brother Jeff Jackson. His theme is, have you been marked for survival? Do you think you know the answer?

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:23.139
Think again, Brother Jackson. How would you answer that question? Have you received the mark?

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:30.019
Perhaps this morning you were more concerned about, do you have your lapel card on so that you

00:44:30.019 --> 00:44:37.619
could gain entry to the auditorium? But when we think about the book of Ezekiel in chapter 9,

00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:44.579
of course, immediately we start to think about the mark for survival that was given.

00:44:47.469 --> 00:44:55.469
What is the meaning of this mark? Have God's people already received the mark for survival?

00:44:56.909 --> 00:45:03.309
Well, further consideration of this prophetic word has helped us to see that there is a need

00:45:03.389 --> 00:45:14.510
for an adjustment. Faithful Christians today have not yet received that mark. Well, of course,

00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:23.150
that brings many questions to mind. First of all, what did Ezekiel see in chapter 9? How was

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:29.710
it fulfilled in his day? And more importantly for us, what does it mean for us today?

00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:38.510
So could I suggest that we turn to the book of Ezekiel together? Ezekiel chapter 9,

00:45:39.550 --> 00:45:45.309
and we're going to read together the whole chapter from verse 1, right through to verse 11.

00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:57.260
Before we do that, let's just have in mind the time frame, 612 BCE, just a few years before

00:45:57.260 --> 00:46:05.500
Jerusalem was to be destroyed. By the time Ezekiel received this prophecy, he'd already seen the

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:12.059
disgusting, the detestable things that were happening right in Jehovah's temple in Jerusalem.

00:46:13.179 --> 00:46:19.500
He realized from the message that it was given him that there was no return for them as far as

00:46:19.579 --> 00:46:28.619
the spiritual decay and decadence had gone. Jerusalem was to be destroyed. The temple was to be destroyed.

00:46:30.059 --> 00:46:37.500
Now, if we were Ezekiel at that time, what question would we have asked? Will anyone survive?

00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:44.780
Well, let's turn our attention now to Ezekiel chapter 9, verses 1 through 11.

00:46:45.739 --> 00:46:53.260
He then called out in my ears with a loud voice saying, some and those who will bring punishment

00:46:53.260 --> 00:47:01.579
on the city, each one with his weapon for destruction in his hand. I saw six men coming from the

00:47:01.579 --> 00:47:08.139
direction of the upper gate that faces north, each with his weapon for smashing in his hand,

00:47:09.099 --> 00:47:14.860
and there was one man among them clothed in linen with a secretary's ink horn at his waist,

00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:23.659
and they came in and stood beside the copper altar. Then the glory of the God of Israel rose from

00:47:23.659 --> 00:47:29.579
where it had rested above the cherubs and moved to the threshold of the doorway of the house,

00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:37.340
and he began calling out to the man who was clothed in linen at whose waist was the secretary's ink horn.

00:47:38.619 --> 00:47:47.260
Jehovah said to him, go through the city, through Jerusalem, and put a mark on the farads of the

00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:53.579
men who are sighing and groaning over all the detestable things that are being done in the city.

00:47:55.099 --> 00:48:03.099
And to the others, he said in my hearing, go through the city after him and strike. Do not let your

00:48:03.099 --> 00:48:13.340
eye feel sorry. Do not feel any compassion. Old man, young man, virgin, little child and women,

00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:23.019
you should kill off completely. But do not go near to any man on whom there is the mark. You should

00:48:23.019 --> 00:48:31.340
start from my sanctuary. So they started with the elders who were in front of the house. Then he said

00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:40.139
to them, the file the house and filled the courtyards with the slain, go. So they went out and struck down

00:48:40.139 --> 00:48:49.579
people in the city. While he was striking them down, I alone was left and I fell face down and

00:48:49.579 --> 00:48:57.500
cried out, Alas, so sovereign Lord Jehovah, are you going to destroy all the remaining ones of Israel

00:48:57.500 --> 00:49:05.900
while you pour out your rage on Jerusalem? So he said to me, the error of the house of Israel and

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:14.539
Judah is very, very great. The land is filled with bloodshed and the city is full of corruption.

00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:24.219
For they say, Jehovah has left the land and Jehovah is not seen. But as for me, my eye will not

00:49:24.219 --> 00:49:32.219
feel sorry, nor will I show compassion, the consequences of their way, I will bring down on their

00:49:32.219 --> 00:49:40.860
own head. Then I saw the man clothes in linen with the incarnate his waist, bringing back words saying,

00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:53.340
I have done just as you have commanded me. What a powerful message. Let's analyze just for a few

00:49:53.340 --> 00:50:02.059
moments the various elements in this particular chapter. First of all, we have seven men, don't we?

00:50:03.179 --> 00:50:13.900
Six men with smashing weapons. The seventh man has a secretary's ink horn. Now we don't normally

00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:21.420
use ink horn these days, do we? I have an ink horn here and just for those who are very enthusiastic,

00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:30.559
it is not a new release. We're not even releasing a barcode scanner that shows you the difference

00:50:30.559 --> 00:50:38.079
between sheep and goats. Now this is just to give us some idea what an ink horn was in ancient times.

00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:45.039
I'm sorry, I couldn't afford one from the time of Ezekiel, but this one is from the Middle East.

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:53.679
So basically in Ezekiel's day, perhaps it was made of wood. There would be some reeds there and

00:50:53.679 --> 00:51:01.599
then a little container within. So this secretary or this man would go and then put the mark on the

00:51:01.599 --> 00:51:09.679
fabric. So that's what we're talking about. That this man with the secretary's ink horn would go

00:51:10.239 --> 00:51:17.519
and put a mark on those who were sighing and groaning. And the six men, well as it mentions here,

00:51:18.159 --> 00:51:27.039
they would destroy all those that did not have the mark. Well how was this prophecy fulfilled

00:51:27.039 --> 00:51:35.760
in Ezekiel's time? Obviously in the year 607 BCE, there was a destruction of the apostates that

00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:43.199
lived in Jerusalem at that time. In fact, the Babylonian armies were spoken of as a cup in the hand

00:51:43.199 --> 00:51:50.960
of Jehovah to discipline those who had turned their backs on Jehovah. But this is the question

00:51:51.679 --> 00:52:00.559
that we need to ask ourselves. Was the destruction indiscriminate? No, it wasn't.

00:52:01.519 --> 00:52:08.639
Jehovah never sweeps away the righteous together with the wicked. When we look at other

00:52:08.639 --> 00:52:15.920
scriptures, particularly the book of Jeremiah, we see that the Reckobites, Ebed Melek, Jeremiah,

00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:24.559
Embaric all survived. These ones had showed faithfulness before the time of destruction.

00:52:25.519 --> 00:52:31.840
And clearly, they at one point were marked for survival and survived they did.

00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:41.679
But how were these ones marked for survival? Well, we are not told that Ezekiel took something

00:52:41.679 --> 00:52:49.519
like this and went through the city marking persons as to whether they would survive or not.

00:52:50.239 --> 00:52:59.840
What is described here in Ezekiel chapter 9 is what happened in the invisible realm behind the

00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:08.480
scenes. Yes, Jehovah's representatives, the angels, the angelic forces were very much involved

00:53:09.199 --> 00:53:14.480
with isolating and finding those who would be marked for survival.

00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:24.320
Well, what does this mean for us today? First of all, let's review what we currently believe.

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:30.400
For many of us, we haven't discussed this subject for quite a while. You don't have to remember

00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:38.909
this part of the talk though, believe me. Well, up until recently, publications have explained

00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:47.150
that the man dressed in linen with the second freezing corn represented the anointed remnant

00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:54.030
who spearhead the preaching work. And in a symbolic way, as they preach the message,

00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:59.869
people, due to their accepting the message, could be marked for survival.

00:54:01.309 --> 00:54:07.949
What is the mark? Well, we've explained that it's the evidence a person produces to show that

00:54:08.670 --> 00:54:15.550
dedicated baptized Christians who have put on the Christlike personality. And who are the ones marked?

00:54:16.429 --> 00:54:23.469
Well, again, the watchtower has soaked us to see a great crowd would be marked. And these ones then

00:54:23.469 --> 00:54:28.510
would join the anointed remnant in this so-called marking work.

00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:37.070
Well, why would we need to change that? As we look at the scriptures as a whole,

00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:45.789
and we compare what Ezekiel saw with what Jesus tells us about the great tribulation,

00:54:45.789 --> 00:54:52.030
particularly with the judgment of the sheep and goats. We have to see, as Brother Leth mentioned,

00:54:52.030 --> 00:54:58.750
how everything fits in. So when we think about the power below the illustration of the sheep and

00:54:58.750 --> 00:55:07.389
goats, who does the judging work, who decides whether someone is a sheep or a goat?

00:55:09.309 --> 00:55:18.750
It's Jesus Christ, isn't it? So we understand then that Jesus is the one who makes this determination.

00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:25.630
Additionally, looking at our adjusted understanding of the power of the sheep and goats,

00:55:26.349 --> 00:55:37.070
we realize the timeframe, not now, but during the great tribulation. So this helps us to understand

00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:43.150
how chapter 9 of Ezekiel should be applied. And looking back there again,

00:55:44.030 --> 00:55:49.630
we know in recent years we've been careful not to try and make types and anti-types

00:55:50.269 --> 00:55:57.070
of every aspect of what the Bible says. For example, if we go back to Ezekiel chapter 9 verse 2,

00:55:57.789 --> 00:56:04.590
how easy it would be for us to become sidetracked with the upper gate? What does that mean?

00:56:05.869 --> 00:56:15.550
If Jesus north, not south, then they stood beside the copper altar, which side? Front back,

00:56:15.550 --> 00:56:26.590
beside that side? It doesn't matter. The main thing is for us to realize Ezekiel saw something

00:56:26.590 --> 00:56:34.190
that was fulfilled in his day. Jesus tells us that something similar is facing us in the future.

00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:42.429
So the main thing we need to ask is what lessons do we learn from this particular passage of

00:56:42.429 --> 00:56:47.389
Scripture? And we could say there are five lessons that we'll quickly go through.

00:56:48.349 --> 00:56:55.309
The first lesson is that Jehovah always warns people before destruction comes.

00:56:56.429 --> 00:57:05.630
We know in the time of back in 607 prior to that time, Isaiah, Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Daniel,

00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:14.190
they were all inspired to utter prophecies to warn persons. Well, today is a similar arrangement.

00:57:14.909 --> 00:57:21.389
We know there's a small group of anointed ones that are taking the lead in feeding and warning

00:57:21.389 --> 00:57:28.110
God's people, and this message is going out worldwide. The second lesson,

00:57:28.590 --> 00:57:38.590
Jehovah's people today do not mark those who will survive. Just the same as in Ezekiel's time,

00:57:38.590 --> 00:57:47.389
Ezekiel didn't go through and mark who would receive that mark for survival. Rather, our responsibility

00:57:47.389 --> 00:57:53.710
is to convey the warning message and help others to come into a good relationship with Jehovah.

00:57:54.190 --> 00:58:04.110
The third lesson. To survive this upcoming destruction, individuals need to prove now

00:58:05.070 --> 00:58:11.070
their faith in Jehovah. So what are some of the things that we could say are similar?

00:58:11.710 --> 00:58:16.510
Today, people need to sign, groan over the detestable things that are happening.

00:58:17.230 --> 00:58:23.389
They need to react favorably to the preaching work. They should logically follow the command

00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:30.110
to get baptized in symbol of their dedication. Yes, they need to put on the Christlike personality

00:58:30.750 --> 00:58:38.590
and actively support Christ's brothers. All of this needs to be done prior to the outbreak of

00:58:38.590 --> 00:58:49.070
the Great Tribulation. The fourth lesson. Behind the scenes, the heavenly armies we might say will

00:58:49.070 --> 00:58:58.110
be involved with marking who will be deserving of survival. Jesus Christ and the angels will in

00:58:58.110 --> 00:59:07.949
effect be putting marks on the farts of those who will survive. So the great crowd will be marked

00:59:07.949 --> 00:59:18.989
as sheep shortly before the outbreak of Armageddon. The fifth lesson. Jesus Christ and his

00:59:18.989 --> 00:59:27.630
heavenly armies along together with the 144,000 will destroy the nations that oppose Jehovah

00:59:28.269 --> 00:59:34.349
and his King Jesus Christ. So those are the five lessons that we see as parallels here.

00:59:34.909 --> 00:59:41.550
First of all, Jehovah always gives a warning. Secondly, we don't actually do the marking work

00:59:41.550 --> 00:59:49.869
ourselves. The third point to survive this coming Great Tribulation people need to act now.

00:59:50.989 --> 00:59:57.789
The fourth point behind the scenes, Jesus and the angels will determine just prior to Armageddon

00:59:57.789 --> 01:00:04.190
who really are sheep. And then finally, the destruction of all wickedness when this earth will be

01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:12.590
cleansed. Well, how do we feel about this understanding? Truly, it's exciting, isn't it? It builds

01:00:12.590 --> 01:00:19.789
out trust in Jehovah because we know that Jehovah has an arrangement in place whereby the righteous

01:00:19.789 --> 01:00:27.070
will not be destroyed with the wicked. As we face the Great Tribulation, we can do so in confidence

01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:34.190
knowing that Jehovah and Jesus will select those who truly should survive the Great Tribulation.

01:00:34.989 --> 01:00:40.989
But at the same time, doesn't it help us to see the importance of the preaching work that we're

01:00:40.989 --> 01:00:48.670
doing now? People need to hear the message. Yes, we need to preach this message, this message

01:00:48.670 --> 01:00:56.750
of warning, so that when the Great Tribulation does break out, then those that are faithful will

01:00:56.750 --> 01:01:03.230
receive that mark of survival. So brothers and sisters, what does that mean for us? What do we need?

01:01:04.030 --> 01:01:12.750
We don't need one of these. We don't need a bar code scanner. What we need is to fulfill the

01:01:12.829 --> 01:01:20.349
commission that Jehovah and Jesus have given us. Continue to preach the message. Help new ones to

01:01:20.349 --> 01:01:26.909
learn about Jehovah. Yes, help them to take their stand on the right side and then prior to

01:01:26.909 --> 01:02:10.110
Amageddon, they will receive the mark for survival. Well, what do you think? Was it worthwhile

01:02:10.110 --> 01:02:32.530
attending this annual meeting today? We thanked Jehovah for all of the spiritual food that he

01:02:32.530 --> 01:02:38.690
has provided. And in our prayers, I'm sure that we will all remember him and remember that he

01:02:38.690 --> 01:02:45.409
is the giver of every good gift and perfect present. All credit, all praise goes to him.

01:02:46.210 --> 01:02:52.690
We're going to have an opportunity to praise Jehovah now in song and we're going to follow the same

01:02:52.690 --> 01:03:05.409
routine. We're going to sing song number 144. Song number 144, a very cheerful song. It means

01:03:05.409 --> 01:03:12.130
their life.
