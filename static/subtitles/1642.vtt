00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:19.339
In November 2019, the governing body of Jehovah's Witnesses reported an amazing milestone.

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:26.440
Content on jw.org was now available in 1,000 languages.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.440
We thanked Jehovah for this accomplishment.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:35.840
He guides us with his Holy Spirit to make disciples the people of all the nations.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.640
But it didn't stop at 1,000.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.039
More than 20 languages have been added since that 2019 report.

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:51.439
Translating media into over 1,000 languages is an incredible amount of work.

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:57.740
And it requires close cooperation across many parts of our organization.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:03.039
Translation teams work under the direction of the writing committee of the governing body.

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.939
Additionally, the publishing committee of the governing body supports their work

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:14.640
by building remote translation offices and equipping them with the tools they need.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.840
These remote translation offices are established where people speak the language being translated.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.239
In this video report, we'll see how this is done using adaptable methods

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:31.439
that make wise use of our donations.

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:40.840
But most important, we'll see the good results when people are able to learn about Jehovah and their own language.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:47.140
Living with the language we translate is spoken as helped us to improve the way we translate our publications.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.140
We are now able to interact directly with the native speakers when we go in the ministry

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.890
and attend meetings and assemblies.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.689
The other benefit is that the commuter volunteers who come and help daily at the RTO

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.489
were born and raised right here.

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:09.289
This fact makes these brothers and sisters a precious part of the translation team

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.090
because they write in a way that is clear and easy to understand.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.990
The remote translation offices arrangement has proved to be very effective.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:26.389
Over time, the worldwide design construction department working under the direction of the publishing committee

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:32.590
worked to simplify new RTOs and adjust existing ones.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.689
A small RTO can be established in a kingdom hall like this one in Easter Island

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:43.090
or at an assembly hall like here in Guatemala.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.960
These flexible solutions make the best use of dedicated funds.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.560
The translation office was built very quickly with red bricks

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:00.099
which made it possible for us to move in within four months.

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:06.099
We never expected that we could be given such a beautiful place as this.

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.099
Constructed in record time.

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.900
In about six months, they constructed the residence building,

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.000
the offices and the recording studio.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.800
In Bangalore, India, rented space in this commercial building is used as a support RTO.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.599
As a result, support for translation only RTOs can be fairly simple.

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:35.400
This also means that the space requirements for a translation only RTO reduces significantly.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.300
The team takes the translated text from the translators

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.300
and then they can word it into a design format that can be used for printing

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.199
or for distribution over the web

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.300
and can also be read on the JW Library app

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.400
or can be heard as an audio recording.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.099
For a number of years, they were just a handful of RTOs.

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:00.000
Today, there are over 400 worldwide.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.199
That tremendous growth is possible in part

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:07.500
because of the way we now build and equip RTOs.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.099
Isn't it wonderful to be part of Jehovah's people

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:17.100
who make such great efforts to reach as many people as possible, regardless of language?

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.100
Since the language used in the publications is easy to understand,

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.600
I really enjoyed doing my personal study.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.600
This has made it possible to know our father Jehovah better

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.600
and it has also helped me to teach others about Jehovah

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.600
who are also making Jehovah their friend.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.600
At Isaiah 65-13, Jehovah says,

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.600
Look, my servants will eat, but you will go hungry.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:53.600
Look, my servants will drink, but you will go thirsty.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.600
Jehovah's promise to feed his people will not go unfulfilled.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.100
It's the publishing committee's privilege to assist in that feeding.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.600
We pray for Jehovah's blessing on our efforts

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.600
to provide remote translation offices

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.600
wherever they are needed to support God's people.
