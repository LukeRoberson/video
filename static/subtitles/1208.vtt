00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:10.699
One afternoon as we were going to our meeting I was rubbed by a couple of thieves young men

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:15.109
But right away they're at home

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:18.390
We realized that the best thing to do was to go to the meeting anyway

00:00:19.149 --> 00:00:21.149
We just had to go to the meeting

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:23.870
It didn't make any sense to stay at home

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.989
Crying and feeling all negative and and frustrated

00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:32.229
At the kingdom hall you feel refreshed

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.469
It's a safe place and you feel at peace

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:44.679
Your thoughts calmed down and those terrible feelings caused by being a victim of the bad things that happened in this system

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.320
dissipate

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.439
This was the third vehicle I'd had as a taxi driver

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.399
It was a really big blow financially

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.119
The brothers found out that I'd lost my means of living and

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.759
No longer had an income and what I was wondering what to do

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:06.680
They began to attend to each of our needs

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:16.109
David my son

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:19.709
He left to go on a Bible study with another brother from the congregation

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.579
But less than half an hour later I got a call from the brother who was with him

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:31.219
He gave me the terrible news that my son had been run over

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.299
Well when we got to where he was being treated there were many brothers there already

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:41.659
Many brothers to this day. I can't figure out how they got there so quickly

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:44.459
Who called them how they found out?

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.819
Our son's accident was so distressing our hearts took a beating

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:58.260
As my heart was aching it was as if Jehovah took my heart in his hand and caressed it

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:00.739
Don't you worry calm down?

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.540
Everything will be all right

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.540
Just keep calm

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.539
You've suffered a test

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:16.780
But now you'll see my hand in this I won't be coming down to be with you personally, but look at all that's happening

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:19.419
And and we saw Jehovah's power

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.340
I'm not saying that it was good that it happened

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.979
But it is important to see how Jehovah takes care of things

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:31.900
Not a year passed by between the theft of my car and my son's accident

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:34.780
The brothers were always there for us

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.460
Agreeing a hearty handshake. I'm meaningful. We're right here, brother

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.819
And often there was something in that handshake

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.500
Money for things we needed at that moment

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.699
Thanks to Jehovah my wife my son and me feel very happy

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:57.060
Amazed by all the good things Jehovah does for us each day

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:04.060
I want to take hold of Jehovah's hand. I concentrate on that and pray every day to be able to cope with whatever

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:11.620
Problems arise and another important thing. I know that I can count to my friends. I don't have to face things alone

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:27.979
I had a comfortable economic situation

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:34.060
For 20 years. I worked as the supervisor of a firm contracted by the oil industry

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:42.219
My family of five made up of my wife my three daughters and myself never had to worry about food

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.180
One afternoon as I watched the news on television

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.900
I learned that the company I worked for had come under new management

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:58.300
That Monday when I went to work I arrived at my office and found the new supervisor

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:02.699
Sitting in my chair that I had occupied for 20 years

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:06.419
I saw my resume in his hand

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:11.580
He congratulated me for being a hard worker who was honest and productive

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.099
But he said there was just one thing missing. I

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:19.019
Needed to join a political party

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:27.420
I replied as tactfully as I could that my wife and I were Jehovah's Witnesses and that we were neutral in political matters

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:30.699
The mood quickly deteriorated

00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:36.540
Visibly angered the supervisor's facial expression and tone of voice changed and he threatened me

00:04:37.019 --> 00:04:41.500
Saying that if I did not join the political party that would be my last day at work

00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:45.019
I did not sign it or join the political party

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.060
Because that would be like committing adultery and keeping quiet about it

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:53.500
I would feel as if I had betrayed Jehovah

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.180
I could have signed and kept my old job

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.139
But I knew my conscience would bother me

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:02.300
For the rest of my life

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.500
I would never be able to go to the congregation and serve as an elder

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.220
Knowing that I had let Jehovah down

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.060
Suddenly I was unemployed

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.699
I lost 20 years of work and the severance and seniority pay I was due

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:22.300
My wife and my daughters were waiting for me

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.660
And right then and there we pray together and ask Jehovah to please provide for us

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.259
To please not let us be tempted beyond what we could bear

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.459
We knew we were facing a huge test

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.259
But that we would prevail because we had been obedient to Jehovah

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:48.529
Since losing my job, I've done several different odd jobs like gardening and painting houses

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:51.410
And at present I work with public transportation

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:57.329
My daughter, Hinesarethe, the second oldest, paints pictures and we sell them

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:03.329
My wife makes food in homemade sweets and we have learned other skills as well

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:06.129
We have greatly simplified our life

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:11.250
My wife and I were even invited to pioneer school in 2014

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.939
Our two older daughters auxiliary pioneer from time to time

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.939
And our youngest daughter who is 13 was baptized

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.980
Jehovah has never let us down
