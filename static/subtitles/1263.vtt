00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.849
Jehovah highly values the loyalty of his worshipers.

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:12.849
He especially appreciates it when we are loyal to him even under adversity.

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.850
How does Jehovah respond when we remain loyal to him?

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.850
He in turn takes great pleasure in showing his loyalty to us.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.850
Psalm 145 verse 17 says,

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.850
Jehovah is loyal in all that he does.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.850
This means that Jehovah is dependable, always faithful.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.850
He will never abandon his friends.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.850
How do you feel about having Jehovah on your side?

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.159
There is no greater blessing.

00:00:53.159 --> 00:01:00.159
Jehovah is willing and able to use his limitless power in behalf of his people.

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:04.159
So it makes sense to be on Jehovah's side.

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:14.159
For that reason most, if not all of Jehovah's worshipers, start out with every intention of being loyal to him.

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.159
But there is a difference between wanting to be loyal to God,

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:26.159
claiming to be loyal to God, and actually remaining loyal to God.

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.159
Every one of us will have our loyalty to Jehovah put to the test.

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:38.159
When that happens, will you take a firm stand on Jehovah's side?

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:45.159
The issue of loyalty is clearly illustrated by the events that took place in the wilderness of Sinai,

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.159
shortly after the Israelites left Egypt.

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.159
God's people started out with every intention of being loyal to Jehovah.

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.159
They entered into a covenant in which they promised to be loyal to God.

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.159
And Jehovah in turn offered them his unbreakable loyalty.

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.159
What lessons can we learn from this account?

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:14.159
Let us start by reading Exodus 20 verses 1 through 7.

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:19.789
Then God spoke all these words.

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:27.789
I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:32.789
You must not have any other gods besides me.

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:39.789
You must not make for yourself a carved image or a form like anything that is in the heavens above,

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:44.789
or on the earth below, or in the waters under there.

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:49.789
You must not bow down to them, nor be enticed to serve them.

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:55.789
For I, Jehovah your God, and a God who requires exclusive devotion,

00:02:55.789 --> 00:03:02.789
bringing punishment for the error of fathers upon sons, upon the third generation,

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:06.789
and upon the fourth generation of those who hate me,

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:15.789
but showing loyal love to the thousandth generation of those who love me and keep my commandments.

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:20.789
You must not take up the name of Jehovah your God in a worthless way.

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:30.159
For Jehovah will not leave unpunished the one who takes up his name in a worthless way.

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:33.159
Try to visualize what happened here.

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:42.159
Just three months after the awesome display of Jehovah's power in the ten plagues on Egypt and the crossing of the Red Sea,

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:49.159
God's people find themselves in front of a violently trembling Mount Sinai.

00:03:49.159 --> 00:04:01.159
There is thunder and lightning, a heavy cloud, smoke, and what seems to be the loud and constant sound of a horn.

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:14.159
In this setting, Jehovah describes himself as a loyal God, promising to show loyal love to those who give him exclusive devotion.

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:24.160
In effect, Jehovah was telling his people, if you prove to be on my side, I will prove to be on your side.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.160
How did the Israelites respond to Jehovah's pledge of loyalty?

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:37.160
Let's follow this account by reading Exodus 24, 3 through 18.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:45.160
Then Moses came and related to the people all the words of Jehovah and all the judicial decisions,

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.160
and all the people answered with one voice,

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:54.160
all the words that Jehovah has spoken we are willing to do.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.160
So Moses wrote down all the words of Jehovah.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.160
Then he got up early in the morning and built at the foot of the mountain, an altar,

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.160
and twelve pillars corresponding to the twelve tribes of Israel.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:14.160
After that, he sent young Israelites men, and they offered up burnt offerings,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.160
and sacrificed bowls as communion sacrifices to Jehovah.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:26.160
Then Moses took half of the blood and put it in bowls, and half the blood he sprinkled on the altar.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:33.160
Then he took the book of the covenant and read it aloud to the people, and they said,

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:39.160
All that Jehovah has spoken we are willing to do, and we will be obedient.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:44.160
So Moses took the blood and sprinkled it on the people and said,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:52.160
This is the blood of the covenant that Jehovah has made with you in harmony with all these words.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:59.160
Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel went up,

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.160
and they saw the God of Israel.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.160
Under his feet was what seemed like a sapphire pavement,

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.160
and it was as pure as the heavens themselves.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:19.160
He did not harm the distinguished men of Israel, and they saw a vision of the true God,

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.160
an eight, and drank. Jehovah now said to Moses,

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.160
Come up to me on the mountain, and stay there.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:36.160
I will give you the stone tablets with the law and the commandment that I will write for their instruction.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:43.160
So Moses got up with his attendant Joshua, and Moses went up the mountain of the true God,

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.160
but to the elders he had said,

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.160
Wait here for us until we return to you.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:56.160
You have Aaron and her with you, whoever has a legal case may go to them.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:01.160
Then Moses went up the mountain while the cloud was covering it.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:08.160
Jehovah's glory remained on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it for six days.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.160
On the seventh day he called to Moses from the midst of the cloud.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:20.160
To the Israelites who were watching, the appearance of Jehovah's glory was like a consuming fight on the mountain cloud.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.160
Moses then entered into the cloud, and went up the mountain,

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:33.170
and Moses stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights.

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:37.170
Imagine how thrilled the Israelites must have been.

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:41.170
There they were in the presence of the only true God,

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:47.170
listening to Jehovah's promise of loyalty and making it covenant with him.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:52.170
At Exodus 195, Jehovah tells them,

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:58.170
If you will strictly obey my voice and keep my covenant,

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:06.170
you will certainly become my special property out of all peoples for the whole earth belongs to me.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:14.170
As you might expect, the Israelites responded with a strong determination to be obedient, faithful,

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:17.170
yes loyal to Jehovah.

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:20.170
Inanimously they replied,

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:27.170
All that Jehovah has spoken, we are willing to do, and we will be obedient.

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:35.169
However, as mentioned earlier, there is a difference between wanting to be loyal to God,

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:42.169
claiming to be loyal to God, and actually remaining loyal to God.

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:49.169
In the account we are reading, these Israelites had every intention of being loyal to Jehovah,

00:08:49.169 --> 00:08:55.169
but could their loyalty withstand an unexpected test?

00:08:55.169 --> 00:09:03.169
Let's follow along with the reading of Exodus chapter 32 verses 1-35.

00:09:03.169 --> 00:09:13.179
Meanwhile, the people saw that Moses was taking a long time coming down from the mountain,

00:09:13.179 --> 00:09:18.179
so the people gathered around Aaron, and said to him,

00:09:18.179 --> 00:09:22.179
Get up, make for us a God who will go ahead of us,

00:09:22.179 --> 00:09:26.179
because we do not know what has happened to this Moses,

00:09:26.179 --> 00:09:29.179
the man who let us up out of the land of Egypt.

00:09:29.179 --> 00:09:32.179
At this Aaron said to them,

00:09:32.179 --> 00:09:39.179
Take the gold earrings from the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me.

00:09:39.179 --> 00:09:44.179
For all the people began taking off the gold earrings that were in their ears,

00:09:44.179 --> 00:09:46.179
and bringing them to Aaron.

00:09:46.179 --> 00:09:51.179
Then he took the gold from them, and he formed it with an engraving tool,

00:09:51.179 --> 00:09:54.179
and made it into a statue of a calf.

00:09:54.179 --> 00:09:56.179
They began to say,

00:09:56.179 --> 00:10:02.179
This is your God, O Israel, who led you up out of the land of Egypt.

00:10:02.179 --> 00:10:06.179
When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it.

00:10:06.179 --> 00:10:08.179
Then Aaron called out.

00:10:08.179 --> 00:10:11.179
There is a festival to Jehovah tomorrow.

00:10:11.179 --> 00:10:13.179
So they got up early on the next day,

00:10:13.179 --> 00:10:16.179
and began offering up burnt offerings,

00:10:16.179 --> 00:10:19.179
and presenting communion sacrifices.

00:10:19.179 --> 00:10:23.179
After that the people sat down to eat and drink.

00:10:23.179 --> 00:10:26.179
Then they got up to have a good time.

00:10:26.179 --> 00:10:29.179
Jehovah now said to Moses,

00:10:29.179 --> 00:10:33.179
Go, this sin, because your people,

00:10:33.179 --> 00:10:38.179
whom you led up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves.

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:42.179
They have quickly deviated from the way I commanded them to go.

00:10:42.179 --> 00:10:46.179
They have made for themselves a statue of a calf,

00:10:46.179 --> 00:10:51.179
and they keep bowing down to it, and sacrificing to it, and saying,

00:10:51.179 --> 00:10:58.179
This is your God, O Israel, who led you up out of the land of Egypt.

00:10:58.179 --> 00:11:01.179
Jehovah went on to say to Moses,

00:11:01.179 --> 00:11:04.179
I have seen that this is an obstinate people.

00:11:04.179 --> 00:11:07.179
So now let me be,

00:11:07.179 --> 00:11:11.179
and I will exterminate them by burning anger,

00:11:11.179 --> 00:11:16.179
and let me make a great nation from you instead.

00:11:16.179 --> 00:11:21.179
Then Moses appealed to Jehovah his God, and said,

00:11:21.179 --> 00:11:27.179
Why, O Jehovah, should you turn your burning anger against your people

00:11:27.179 --> 00:11:31.179
after bringing them out of the land of Egypt with great power,

00:11:31.179 --> 00:11:33.179
and with a mighty hand?

00:11:33.179 --> 00:11:35.179
Why should the Egyptians say,

00:11:35.179 --> 00:11:38.179
He had evil intentions when He led them out,

00:11:38.179 --> 00:11:40.179
He wanted to kill them in the mountains,

00:11:40.179 --> 00:11:43.179
and exterminate them from the surface of the earth?

00:11:43.179 --> 00:11:46.179
Turn from your burning anger,

00:11:46.179 --> 00:11:51.179
and reconsider your decision to bring this calamity on your people.

00:11:51.179 --> 00:11:56.179
Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Israel,

00:11:56.179 --> 00:11:59.179
to whom you swore by yourself and said,

00:11:59.179 --> 00:12:04.179
I will multiply your offspring like the stars of the heavens,

00:12:04.179 --> 00:12:09.179
and I will give all this land that I have designated to your offspring,

00:12:09.179 --> 00:12:13.179
so that they may take it as a permanent possession.

00:12:13.179 --> 00:12:19.179
So Jehovah began to reconsider the calamity that he had spoken of bringing on his people.

00:12:19.179 --> 00:12:25.179
Moses then turned and went down from the mountain with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand.

00:12:25.179 --> 00:12:28.179
The tablets were inscribed on both sides.

00:12:28.179 --> 00:12:32.179
They were written on the front and on the back.

00:12:32.179 --> 00:12:35.179
The tablets were the workmanship of God,

00:12:35.179 --> 00:12:40.179
and the writing was the writing of God engraved on the tablets.

00:12:40.179 --> 00:12:45.179
When Joshua began to hear the noise of the people because of their shouting,

00:12:45.179 --> 00:12:47.179
he said to Moses,

00:12:47.179 --> 00:12:50.179
There is the sound of battle in the camp.

00:12:50.179 --> 00:12:52.179
But Moses said,

00:12:52.179 --> 00:12:56.179
It is not the sound of singing over a victory,

00:12:56.179 --> 00:13:01.179
and it is not the sound of wailing over a defeat.

00:13:01.179 --> 00:13:05.179
I hear the sound of another kind of singing.

00:13:05.179 --> 00:13:08.179
As soon as Moses got near the camp,

00:13:08.179 --> 00:13:11.179
and saw the calf and the dances,

00:13:11.179 --> 00:13:14.179
his anger began to blaze,

00:13:14.179 --> 00:13:17.179
and he threw the tablets from his hand,

00:13:17.179 --> 00:13:20.179
and shattered them at the foot of the mountain.

00:13:20.179 --> 00:13:23.179
He took the calf that they had made,

00:13:23.179 --> 00:13:27.179
and he burned it with fire and crushed it in the powder.

00:13:27.179 --> 00:13:30.179
Then he scattered it on the water,

00:13:30.179 --> 00:13:33.179
and made the Israelites drink it.

00:13:33.179 --> 00:13:35.179
And Moses said to Aaron,

00:13:35.179 --> 00:13:41.179
What did this people do to you that you have brought a great sin upon them?

00:13:41.179 --> 00:13:43.179
Aaron replied,

00:13:43.179 --> 00:13:46.179
Do not be enraged, my Lord.

00:13:46.179 --> 00:13:50.179
You well know that the people are inclined to do evil?

00:13:50.179 --> 00:13:52.179
So they said to me,

00:13:52.179 --> 00:13:55.179
Make for us a God who will go ahead of us.

00:13:55.179 --> 00:13:58.179
For we do not know what has happened to this Moses,

00:13:58.179 --> 00:14:01.179
the man who led us up out of the land of Egypt.

00:14:01.179 --> 00:14:03.179
So I said to them,

00:14:03.179 --> 00:14:07.179
Whoever has any gold must take it off and give it to me.

00:14:07.179 --> 00:14:10.179
Then I threw it into the fire,

00:14:10.179 --> 00:14:12.179
and out came this calf.

00:14:12.179 --> 00:14:16.179
Moses saw that the people were unrestrained,

00:14:16.179 --> 00:14:19.179
for Aaron had let them go unrestrained,

00:14:19.179 --> 00:14:23.179
so that they were a disgrace before their opposes.

00:14:23.179 --> 00:14:27.179
Then Moses took his position in the gate of the camp,

00:14:27.179 --> 00:14:29.179
and said,

00:14:29.179 --> 00:14:32.179
Who is on Jehovah's side?

00:14:32.179 --> 00:14:34.179
Come to me.

00:14:34.179 --> 00:14:37.179
And all the Levites gathered around him.

00:14:37.179 --> 00:14:39.179
He now said to them,

00:14:39.179 --> 00:14:44.179
This is what Jehovah the God of Israel has said.

00:14:44.179 --> 00:14:48.179
Each of you must fasten on his sword

00:14:48.179 --> 00:14:52.179
and pass through all the camp from gate to gate,

00:14:52.179 --> 00:14:58.179
killing his brother, his neighbor, and his close companion.

00:14:58.179 --> 00:15:01.179
The Levites did what Moses said.

00:15:01.179 --> 00:15:06.179
So about 3,000 men were killed on that day.

00:15:07.179 --> 00:15:09.179
Then Moses said,

00:15:09.179 --> 00:15:13.179
Set yourselves apart for Jehovah today.

00:15:13.179 --> 00:15:17.179
For each of you has gone against his own son,

00:15:17.179 --> 00:15:20.179
and his own brother.

00:15:20.179 --> 00:15:24.179
Today he will give you a blessing.

00:15:24.179 --> 00:15:26.179
On the very next day,

00:15:26.179 --> 00:15:29.179
Moses said to the people,

00:15:29.179 --> 00:15:32.179
You committed a very great sin,

00:15:32.179 --> 00:15:35.179
and now I will go up to Jehovah to see

00:15:35.179 --> 00:15:38.179
if I can make amends for your sin.

00:15:38.179 --> 00:15:42.179
So Moses returned to Jehovah and said,

00:15:42.179 --> 00:15:46.179
What a great sin this people has committed.

00:15:46.179 --> 00:15:50.179
They made themselves a God of gold.

00:15:50.179 --> 00:15:55.179
But now if you are willing, pardon their sin.

00:15:55.179 --> 00:16:00.179
If not, please wipe me out from your book that you have written.

00:16:01.179 --> 00:16:04.179
However, Jehovah said to Moses,

00:16:04.179 --> 00:16:06.179
Whoever has sinned against me,

00:16:06.179 --> 00:16:09.179
I will wipe him out of my book.

00:16:09.179 --> 00:16:11.179
Go now.

00:16:11.179 --> 00:16:15.179
Lead the people to the place about which I have spoken to you.

00:16:15.179 --> 00:16:18.179
Look, my angel will go ahead of you,

00:16:18.179 --> 00:16:21.179
and on the day when I make an accounting,

00:16:21.179 --> 00:16:25.179
I will bring punishment on men for their sin.

00:16:25.179 --> 00:16:28.179
Then Jehovah began plaguing the people

00:16:28.179 --> 00:16:30.179
because they had made the camp,

00:16:30.179 --> 00:16:32.179
the one that Aaron had made.

00:16:32.179 --> 00:16:38.539
The Israelites appeared to have every intention

00:16:38.539 --> 00:16:41.539
of being loyal to Jehovah.

00:16:41.539 --> 00:16:44.539
But their faith was evidently too dependent

00:16:44.539 --> 00:16:47.539
on Moses' visible presence.

00:16:47.539 --> 00:16:51.539
When Moses remained on Mount Sinai longer than expected,

00:16:51.539 --> 00:16:54.539
Israelites became anxious.

00:16:54.539 --> 00:16:57.539
Perhaps they felt abandoned by Moses,

00:16:57.539 --> 00:17:00.539
or perhaps they feared that Moses had died up on the mountain.

00:17:01.539 --> 00:17:03.539
Whatever the case,

00:17:03.539 --> 00:17:07.539
they thought of themselves as being stranded in the desert

00:17:07.539 --> 00:17:10.539
without their trustworthy leader.

00:17:10.539 --> 00:17:15.539
Their loyalty was put to the test.

00:17:15.539 --> 00:17:18.539
True loyalty would have moved the Israelites

00:17:18.539 --> 00:17:22.539
to view these disconcerting circumstances

00:17:22.539 --> 00:17:27.539
as an opportunity to prove their exclusive devotion to Jehovah,

00:17:27.539 --> 00:17:31.539
even when they were in distress.

00:17:31.539 --> 00:17:34.539
They sought comfort by pursuing a fleshly course

00:17:34.539 --> 00:17:38.539
that included merry-making, eating, drinking,

00:17:38.539 --> 00:17:41.539
and idolatrous rituals.

00:17:41.539 --> 00:17:44.539
Ironically, they described the event

00:17:44.539 --> 00:17:48.539
as a festival to Jehovah.

00:17:48.539 --> 00:17:50.539
What is more, they deluded themselves

00:17:50.539 --> 00:17:53.539
into believing that the golden calf

00:17:53.539 --> 00:17:57.539
was a representation of Jehovah himself.

00:17:57.539 --> 00:17:59.539
They actually thought

00:17:59.539 --> 00:18:02.539
that they could engage in idolatry

00:18:02.539 --> 00:18:05.539
and still be loyal to Jehovah.

00:18:05.539 --> 00:18:08.539
They wanted to be loyal to Jehovah,

00:18:08.539 --> 00:18:11.539
and they claimed to be loyal

00:18:11.539 --> 00:18:15.539
even while venerating a golden calf.

00:18:15.539 --> 00:18:19.539
How did Jehovah view them and their form of worship?

00:18:20.539 --> 00:18:24.539
Jehovah told Moses that the people had corrupted themselves

00:18:24.539 --> 00:18:27.539
and had deviated from doing his will.

00:18:27.539 --> 00:18:29.539
In his burning anger,

00:18:29.539 --> 00:18:31.539
Jehovah considered annihilating

00:18:31.539 --> 00:18:35.539
the newly formed nation of Israel for their betrayal.

00:18:35.539 --> 00:18:37.539
Not all of the Israelites, however,

00:18:37.539 --> 00:18:40.539
proved to be disloyal to Jehovah.

00:18:40.539 --> 00:18:45.539
Moses, for example, took a firm stand against the idolatrous.

00:18:45.539 --> 00:18:47.539
He took the calf that they had made,

00:18:47.539 --> 00:18:49.539
and he burned it with fire

00:18:49.539 --> 00:18:51.539
and crushed it into powder.

00:18:51.539 --> 00:18:55.539
And when Moses took his position in the gate of the camp

00:18:55.539 --> 00:18:56.539
and said,

00:18:56.539 --> 00:18:58.539
who is on Jehovah's side?

00:18:58.539 --> 00:18:59.539
Come to me.

00:18:59.539 --> 00:19:02.539
All the Levites gathered around him.

00:19:02.539 --> 00:19:04.539
In their loyalty to Jehovah,

00:19:04.539 --> 00:19:08.539
the Levites went so far as to take up the sword

00:19:08.539 --> 00:19:13.539
against their own idolatrous relatives and neighbors.

00:19:13.539 --> 00:19:16.539
Moses and the Levites were unquestionably

00:19:16.539 --> 00:19:18.539
on Jehovah's side.

00:19:18.539 --> 00:19:20.539
In response,

00:19:20.539 --> 00:19:23.539
Jehovah proved loyal to them.

00:19:23.539 --> 00:19:28.539
Jehovah was also loyal to his friends, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,

00:19:28.539 --> 00:19:31.539
by remembering the promises he had made to them.

00:19:31.539 --> 00:19:35.539
So he did not exterminate the entire nation.

00:19:35.539 --> 00:19:42.779
Jehovah is indeed on the side of those who are loyal to him.

00:19:42.779 --> 00:19:46.779
Please follow along as we conclude our Bible reading.

00:19:46.779 --> 00:19:50.779
Let us now read Exodus chapter 34

00:19:50.779 --> 00:19:56.470
verses 1 through 14.

00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:58.470
Then, Jehovah said to Moses,

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:03.470
Carve out for yourself two tablets of stone like the first ones.

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:07.470
And I will write on the tablets the words that appeared on the first tablets,

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:09.470
which you shatter.

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:11.470
Get ready for the morning,

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:14.470
as you will go up in the morning to Mount Sinai

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:18.470
and station yourself before me there on the top of the mountain.

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:22.470
But nobody may go up with you.

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:26.470
And nobody else should be seen anywhere on the mountain.

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:32.470
Not even the flocks or herds should graze in front of that mountain.

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:37.470
So Moses carved out two tablets of stone like the first ones.

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:41.470
And got up early in the morning and went up Mount Sinai

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:44.470
just as Jehovah had commanded him.

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:47.470
And he took the two tablets of stone in his hand.

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:51.470
Then, Jehovah came down in the cloud,

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:54.470
and stationed himself with him there,

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:57.470
and declared the name of Jehovah.

00:20:57.470 --> 00:21:00.470
Jehovah was passing before him and declaring,

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:02.470
Jehovah.

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:07.470
Jehovah, a God merciful and compassionate,

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:12.470
slow to anger and abundant in loyal love and truth,

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:15.470
showing loyal love to thousands,

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:19.470
pardoning error and transgression and sin,

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:23.470
but he will by no means leave the guilty unpunished,

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:29.470
bringing punishment for the error of fathers upon sums and upon grandsons,

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:34.470
upon the third generation and upon the fourth generation.

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:39.470
Moses hurried to bow low to the earth and prostrate himself.

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:41.470
Then he said,

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:46.470
If now I have found favor in your eyes,

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:50.470
or Jehovah, then please, Jehovah,

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:53.470
go along with us in our midst,

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:57.470
although we are an obstinate people,

00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:01.470
and forgive our error and our sin,

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:05.470
and take us as your own possession.

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:07.470
In turn, he said,

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:10.470
Here I am making a covenant.

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:12.470
Before all your people,

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:16.470
I will do wonderful things that have never been done

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:19.470
in all the earth or among all the nations,

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:24.470
and all the people among whom you live will see the work of Jehovah,

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:28.470
for it is an awe-inspiring thing that I am doing with you.

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:32.470
Pay attention to what I am commanding you today.

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:35.470
Here I am driving out from before you,

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:39.470
the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Hittites,

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:42.470
the Parasites, the Highvites,

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:44.470
and the Jebusites.

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:49.470
Be careful that you do not make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:51.470
to which you are going,

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:54.470
or it may prove to be a snare among you,

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:57.470
but you are to pull down their alters,

00:22:57.470 --> 00:23:00.470
or to shatter their sacred pillars,

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:04.470
and their sacred poles you are to cut down.

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:08.470
You must not bow down to another God.

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:13.470
For Jehovah is known for requiring exclusive devotion.

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:18.470
Yes, he is a God who requires exclusive devotion.

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:26.730
What lesson do we learn from this Bible account?

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:31.730
Wanting to be loyal to Jehovah is not enough.

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:34.730
This world's corrupting influences can deceive us

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:38.730
into thinking that we can deviate from Jehovah's principles

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:41.730
and still be loyal to him.

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:46.730
But Jehovah requires exclusive devotion.

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:49.730
Granted, we will face adversities.

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:53.730
We might have unexpected family problems

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:57.730
or encounter serious financial difficulties.

00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:01.730
Members of the congregation may offend us.

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:06.730
Poor health may cause us great suffering.

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:09.730
When experiencing such distress,

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:14.730
we must always remember that violating Jehovah's principles

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:17.730
is never a solution.

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:20.730
But taking a firm stand on Jehovah's side

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:24.730
will always bring blessings.

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:26.730
This is guaranteed

00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:34.730
because Jehovah is always dependable, reliable, and unfailing.

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:37.730
He promises to show loyal love

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:41.730
to those who give him exclusive devotion.

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:44.730
In effect, Jehovah is telling us,

00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:47.730
if you prove to be on my side,

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:50.730
I will prove to be on your side.

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:53.730
As we just read,

00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:57.730
Jehovah will do wonderful things for his people.

00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:01.730
Jehovah is a God merciful and compassionate,

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:03.730
slow to anger,

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:07.730
and abundant in loyal love.
