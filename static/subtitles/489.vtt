00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:07.650
Now, at Matthew chapter 5 and verse 11, Jesus said people would

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:14.650
lyingly say every wicked thing against lovers of truth.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.649
They lied about Jesus Christ.

00:00:17.649 --> 00:00:19.649
They spread lies about first century Christians.

00:00:19.649 --> 00:00:23.649
They spread lies about true worshipers today.

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:27.649
We should expect lies against us, expecting persecution,

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:28.649
expecting reproach.

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:31.649
This is what Jesus said would happen.

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:36.649
And especially during the Lord's day, which we are living in right now,

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.649
prophecies indicate that even at this time,

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.649
reproach and persecution would become clearly evident.

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.649
For example, let's open our Bibles to Revelation chapter 13

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.649
and see how this applies in our day.

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:57.649
Revelation chapter 13, we should expect and prepare for persecution.

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.649
Now, Revelation chapter 13 and verse 1,

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.379
it speaks about a wild beast.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.379
Now, this wild beast is Satan's political creation

00:01:09.379 --> 00:01:12.379
among the masses of mankind.

00:01:12.379 --> 00:01:16.379
But something about this wild beast that we need to understand

00:01:16.379 --> 00:01:20.379
and let's now go to verse 3.

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:26.379
The wild beast or the political creation of Satan the devil

00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:29.379
in verse 3, it says,

00:01:29.379 --> 00:01:37.379
all the earth mankind followed the wild beast with admiration.

00:01:37.379 --> 00:01:38.379
So it's admired.

00:01:38.379 --> 00:01:40.379
In what sense is this wild beast admired?

00:01:40.379 --> 00:01:43.379
Well, it's admired because it endeavours to create

00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:47.379
a higher standard of living in various countries.

00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:49.379
It makes advances in technology.

00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:50.379
It tries to cure diseases.

00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:53.379
So it wins that admiration of people.

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:56.379
Oh, look at the wild beast.

00:01:56.379 --> 00:01:59.379
But now let's go beyond admiration.

00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:02.379
Notice in verse 4 what begins to happen.

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:05.379
And they worshiped the dragon because it gave the authority

00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:06.379
to the wild beast.

00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:08.379
There it is again.

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:12.379
And they worshipped people worshipped the wild beast.

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:16.379
So now we go from admiration to worship,

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.379
worshipping the wild beast.

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:19.379
Well, in what respect?

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:20.379
How is it worshipped?

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:25.379
It's worshipped when people say love of country before love of God.

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:32.379
They put love of country their devotion in nationalism before their love of Jehovah God.

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:35.379
So from admiration to worship.

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:40.819
But now notice verse 7 what happens.

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.819
And it was permitted to wage war with the holy ones true and conquer them.

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.819
And it was given, now notice this, authority.

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:56.819
So now the wild beast is given authority over every tribe, people, tongue, and nation.

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:05.819
Authority, worldwide, authority over the worldwide system of rulership, tribe, people, tongue, and nation.

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.819
And now it uses its authority, especially against Jehovah's people,

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.819
to clamp down on the work that Jehovah God has given us to do.

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.819
To try to ban our work, persecute us.

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.819
That's the authority that they use against God's people.

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.819
We have to be prepared for that.

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:31.289
But now notice here in verse 8, any authority or any victory they might have over God's people,

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:37.289
the intense suffering, yes, that we have to undergo because of this authority.

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:40.289
Well, it's going to be short-lived.

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:43.289
And notice in verse 8 why we say that.

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:52.949
It says not one of their names, not one of their names, that those in Satan's organization,

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:56.949
not one of their names has been written in the scroll of life.

00:03:56.949 --> 00:04:04.949
So any parent victory is short-lived because no one in Satan's visible organization is going to be written in the scroll of life.

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:08.949
The only ones written in the scroll of life here are those who rule with Jesus Christ.

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:15.949
So again, any apparent victory that they might have over God's people is merely temporary.

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:21.259
However, we go further in verse 9.

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:24.259
And now we have a warning.

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:32.259
Verse 9 says, if anyone has an ear, let him hear.

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:34.259
Well, what does this mean?

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:39.259
Well, John now is a giving direction for us to have discernment.

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:43.259
If we have an ear discernment, we have to hear, we have to listen.

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:48.259
Why? Because Jehovah God is allowing the wild beast to have this type of authority.

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:50.259
It's allowing the wild beast to operate.

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:53.259
It's allowing the wild beast to go to these lengths.

00:04:53.259 --> 00:05:00.259
So we have to have discernment and understand what this means in our life.

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:02.259
Well, what does it mean?

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:04.259
Well, verse 10.

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:09.259
If anyone has meant for captivity, he will go into captivity.

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:11.259
So there's the persecution again.

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:15.259
As some of us will go into captivity or our brothers are already in captivity.

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:18.259
We think about those in Russia or an era trade.

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:22.259
They've been in captivity, but we go into captivity then.

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:23.259
We don't compromise.

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:26.259
We hold on to Bible principles.

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:29.259
A little bit further, it goes on in verse 10.

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:33.259
And if anyone will kill with a sword, he must be killed with the sword.

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:35.259
So there it is again.

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:37.259
Some of our brothers have lost their lives.

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:42.259
They've given their lives because of not compromising their integrity keepers.

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:44.259
And this is our lot in life.

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:46.259
It could mean any one of us.

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:51.259
But the fact is, that's why we have an ear of discernment.

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:55.259
And now it goes on in verse 10 and says,

00:05:55.259 --> 00:06:00.259
this is where it calls for endurance and faith on the part of the Holy One.

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:06.259
So it will take a tremendous amount of endurance, not giving up hope in the face of an obstacle.

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:11.259
And faith, this trust and conviction that whatever Jehovah God allows,

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:17.259
will certainly ultimately end up being in our best interests at the end.

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:29.259
So faith, courage, endurance, not compromising and always basing our decisions on Bible principles.

00:06:31.899 --> 00:06:33.899
Now, John goes further in verse 11.

00:06:33.899 --> 00:06:36.899
He identifies now another wild beast.

00:06:36.899 --> 00:06:37.899
He identifies a beast.

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:40.899
This one is, it's a two horn wild beast.

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:44.899
Notice that there in verse 11.

00:06:44.899 --> 00:06:46.899
That's the Anglo-American world power.

00:06:46.899 --> 00:06:48.899
That's a two horn wild beast.

00:06:48.899 --> 00:06:52.899
Now in verse 14, we have another beast.

00:06:52.899 --> 00:06:54.899
This is the image of the wild beast.

00:06:54.899 --> 00:06:56.899
And that's the United Nations.

00:06:56.899 --> 00:06:58.899
So the Anglo-American world power.

00:06:58.899 --> 00:07:03.899
Look what it does there in verse 14 and in verse 15.

00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:05.899
It breeds life into the image.

00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:10.899
So the Anglo-American world power breathing life into the image, the United Nations.

00:07:10.899 --> 00:07:11.899
Why?

00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:15.899
So that I can play a role in world history.

00:07:15.899 --> 00:07:18.899
It can move and exist and act and play a role in world history.

00:07:18.899 --> 00:07:22.899
And that's exactly what we see happening today during the Lord's day.

00:07:22.899 --> 00:07:26.589
But now, verse 16.

00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:30.589
It's something again that we need to discern and understand and have that ear of discernment.

00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:33.589
Verse 16.

00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:36.589
Now it, again, the wild beast.

00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:39.589
It puts under compulsion all people.

00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:44.589
The small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the slaves.

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:48.589
That these should be marked on their right hand and on their forehead.

00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:54.589
So now we're speaking about a mark that the wild beast wants to give all of us.

00:07:54.589 --> 00:08:03.589
All people, you see this wild beast used by the devil to maneuver the wild beast to promote intense suffering,

00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:07.589
particularly on the part of Jehovah God's people.

00:08:07.589 --> 00:08:12.589
So a mark on the right hand showing active support, actively supporting the wild beast,

00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:17.589
giving into nationalism, worldly holidays and so forth.

00:08:17.589 --> 00:08:19.589
This is the mark of the beast.

00:08:19.589 --> 00:08:23.589
The right hand is a symbol of action and active support.

00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:29.589
And then notice even the forehead, mark on the forehead, public identity.

00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:31.589
This is who I support as well.

00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:33.590
It affects one's thinking.

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:38.590
So the mark of the beast is something that, again, the devil uses, it's a demonic mark.

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:43.590
So that one's promotes suffering for those who do not have the mark.

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:45.590
Verse 17.

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:52.590
And nobody can buy or sell except a person having the mark, the name of the wild beast, buying or selling.

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:58.590
So you can imagine that demonic mark of the wild beast, anyone engaged in activities, normal activities,

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:04.590
such as buying or selling, is pressured to do things the way the wild beast wants them to do it.

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:11.590
And again, whether it be holidays or supporting nationalism that are expected to worship the wild beast,

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:15.590
let it rule their lives so as to receive its mark.

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:21.590
Those who refuse to receive the mark, Jehovah's people today will have constant problems.

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:27.590
And this has been true for the over decades we've had to fight court battles because of not having the mark,

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:36.590
endure violent mobs because of not having the mark, thrown into concentration camps, endure lengthy imprisonments because of not having the mark.

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:44.590
And in fact, in some countries our brothers literally are unable to buy or sell or even to obtain property.

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:51.590
And yet in spite of it all, in spite of it all, in spite of the pressure, look at true worship today.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:56.590
Look at the way true worship is not just alive and well, but thriving and vibrant.

00:09:56.590 --> 00:10:03.590
This is an outstanding demonstration of Jehovah's power, his spiritual protection upon millions of his worshipers,

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:06.590
earth wide, integrity keepers.

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:12.590
And this indisputably shows that true worship will never be extinguished from the earth.

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:17.590
And on two sees a great crowd that survived the great tribulation.

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:22.590
So we're thrilled to be able to defend the truth in spite of this type of persecution.

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:24.590
It's our privilege to do so.

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:27.590
And so it's true.

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:32.590
Peter said that people will speak abusively of us, that's true.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:38.590
And we're going to expect persecution, we expect reproach, but in spite of it we are determined.

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:51.590
Not to compromise our faith, not cow in fear, not not tremble at men, but continue to courageously magnify Jehovah God right down to the end.
