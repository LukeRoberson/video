00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:11.539
In recent times, a very popular segment on the Gilead graduations has been a video presentation

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:18.859
that features one of the instructors along with the students called the Inside Story.

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.420
And we're happy to present such a program today.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:29.460
The instructor who is going to serve as moderator of this discussion is brother Trent Lippold.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.100
And the students are going to get a chance to see what they look like on camera.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:42.329
Enjoy the program.

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.890
February 1st, 2018 marked an anniversary for the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.810
Over the past 75 years, Gilead graduates have been going out to the ends of the earth

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.009
to strengthen and stabilize Jehovah's Organization.

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:59.689
And we just love reading yearbook experiences and many of them are from just those places

00:00:59.689 --> 00:01:01.969
that Gilead graduates have gone to.

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:07.450
Well today we have the special opportunity to see and to hear some of the experiences

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.489
of the 144th class of Gilead.

00:01:10.489 --> 00:01:42.750
So it's my pleasure to welcome you to this edition of the Inside Story.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.189
Well we'd like to introduce right away our first guest in this brother Alejandro Besco

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:55.540
pay from Bolivia.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.540
Welcome Alejandro.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.780
It's great to have you with us today.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.980
You and your wife, Yvonne, you served together in the Bolivia branch.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.700
Can you tell us a little bit about what you do there?

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.259
For the last 11 years I have been working in the service department, helping to organize

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.300
the preaching efforts in the country.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.300
Very nice.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.900
And before you came to Bethel, what were you doing?

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.900
Before Bethel, my wife and I spent some years in the circuit work and before that we were

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.620
special pioneers.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.939
Very nice.

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:28.379
So being in the branch in the service department in Bolivia must give you a nice opportunity

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.300
to see the work that's going on in Bolivia.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.099
Would you mind giving us a little update of how the work's going in Bolivia?

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:35.099
Of course.

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:42.099
Currently we have more than 27,000 publishers in Bolivia and the last year we had an increase

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.099
of 4%.

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:50.860
And we can see a great potential for the future because we are conducting more than 43,000

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:51.860
Bible studies.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:52.860
Wow.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:53.860
That is amazing.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.099
Sounds like the truth is reaching everywhere in Bolivia.

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.020
Well, actually not everywhere, but we are improving.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.460
So what do you mean by that, not exactly everywhere?

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:14.300
Bolivia has about 11 million people and while most live in urban areas, there is about 35,000

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:20.819
living in isolated spots along three main rivers in the north, Madre de Dios River, Beni

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.139
River and Mamore River.

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:24.699
So what are you doing to reach those people?

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:31.539
Well, in 2015, brothers are starting to organize four by four preaching campaigns.

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:32.539
Four by four, that's interesting.

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:34.379
We're here, we preach two by two.

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:39.340
So yes, four by four refers to our vehicles.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.340
Of course.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:48.180
Last year, we have more than 300 vehicle groups participating in this campaign.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:55.099
We were able to reach many villages, but not all of them because some had no road access

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:56.099
at all.

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.020
Wow, that isolated.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.900
So how do you reach these places then that have no road access?

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.500
Well, we began renting boats.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.539
We were able to reach many villages for the first time.

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:15.659
We started many Bible studies and after that, we reported the success to the service committee

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:16.660
of the government.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:17.660
Wow.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.500
That sounds, I mean, it sounds like you solved the problem.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.060
Yes, I know.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:30.540
We realized that in order to continue preaching there, we needed just a small thing, our own

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.899
boat, your own boat, what was wrong with the rented boat?

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:35.899
Was there a problem?

00:04:35.899 --> 00:04:41.300
Well, not a problem, but many problems.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.459
Here's an example of the boats we used to rent.

00:04:44.459 --> 00:04:51.300
You can see there are wooden, old, people and supplies are all crammed together and in

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.660
order to be more effective, we realized that we needed our own boat.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.379
To be a little bit safer too, I suspect?

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:02.379
Yes, you cannot be effective if you are squished.

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:06.620
So, tell us, did you get your own boat?

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:13.100
Yeah, and even we gave it a name, the messenger of the kingdom, or in Spanish, the mensajero

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.100
de Reino.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.420
Very nice.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.819
So what's it like, how does preaching with boats work?

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.500
What can I show you?

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.670
Sure.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:31.189
Bolivia river witnessing is started with wooden boats, but La Jehovah says, instead of the

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:37.110
wood, he will bring in better, stronger materials.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:43.430
Messenger of the kingdom is custom made for river witnessing, it's small, so it can be

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.670
taken to different towns on launch closer to where we'll preach.

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:53.269
The roof holds literature and supplies.

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:58.430
Over 200 pioneers apply to help.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.709
They meet plenty of creatures on the river.

00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:04.829
With some, you don't want to get too close.

00:06:04.829 --> 00:06:10.709
Jehovah's beautiful creation is part of the journey, but the brothers and sisters are

00:06:10.709 --> 00:06:17.110
looking for people, once rightly disposed for everlasting life.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:23.350
They'll often find interest in the morning, make return visits in the afternoon, and invite

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:37.220
them to a meeting that same even, a trip last seven to ten days.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:43.740
All the work and preparation is worth the effort, and before they know it, it's back on

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.579
the river and on to the next village.

00:06:46.579 --> 00:06:57.009
Wow, Alejandro, that looks very exciting.

00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:03.730
Yes, of course, there are many potential dangers, like animals, strong currents, rocks,

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.129
but it's worth it.

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:11.290
For example, in the village of Baranquilla, brothers met Alejandro, the first time they

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:12.649
came.

00:07:12.649 --> 00:07:19.329
And the next time, the whole village was waiting with Alejandro, over 40 people.

00:07:19.329 --> 00:07:25.449
All of them wanted to hear the good news, and many Bible studies were started.

00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:30.610
The tremendous response, I think Alejandro, you're going to have a lot more applicants

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:34.009
to go on these boat preaching tours.

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:39.649
So what would you say has been the effect on the publishers who make the trips to preach?

00:07:39.649 --> 00:07:48.250
Well, honestly, at first, we were concerned about sending pioneers to the jungle, but

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:55.410
they actually thank it as, because they say it was very encouraging to share the truth

00:07:55.569 --> 00:07:58.329
with many interested people.

00:07:58.329 --> 00:08:03.649
They said it was a spiritual gift for them.

00:08:03.649 --> 00:08:09.089
For me and other brothers in the branch, it was very faith-strickening to see how Jehovah

00:08:09.089 --> 00:08:13.850
removed any obstacle in order to the people can hear the good news.

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:14.850
Very nice.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:18.170
I mean, in its faith-strickening to us to be able to see those experience, I can see why

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:21.930
those pioneers thank you for that opportunity.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:26.730
You have a nice privilege of organizing this work, working in the service department,

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:30.769
but let me ask you, Alejandro, how many trips have you been on?

00:08:30.769 --> 00:08:33.090
Ah, not yet.

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:39.090
My wife, Iván, says that I need to become a good swimmer first.

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:42.009
Your wife, Iván, is a smart woman.

00:08:42.009 --> 00:08:53.049
Thank you very much, Alejandro, for sharing your experiences with us.

00:08:53.049 --> 00:09:07.559
So we'd like to invite out our next guest, and it's Brother Arlindo Tito from Mozambique.

00:09:07.559 --> 00:09:09.000
Welcome, Arlindo.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.919
Arlindo, you coming from Mozambique, would you mind sharing a little bit of your background

00:09:13.919 --> 00:09:14.919
with us?

00:09:14.919 --> 00:09:15.919
Sure.

00:09:15.919 --> 00:09:21.759
I inherited the truth from my parents, saying my grandparents, and from the last seven

00:09:21.759 --> 00:09:27.480
years, I've been working at the branch in Mozambique for some time in our Jewish department,

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.759
but for most of the time in our county department.

00:09:29.759 --> 00:09:35.240
Ah, that's a beautiful spiritual heritage that you have, and now Gilead School.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:39.919
Have I understand that one of your assignments at Bethel was connected with part of the rich

00:09:39.919 --> 00:09:41.559
spiritual history of Mozambique?

00:09:41.559 --> 00:09:47.759
Yes, I had this privilege, but I could say that it all started with singing.

00:09:47.759 --> 00:09:48.759
Singing?

00:09:48.759 --> 00:09:49.759
How, how was that?

00:09:49.759 --> 00:09:50.759
Could you explain that?

00:09:50.759 --> 00:09:57.039
Well, there was a time that singing was like a spiritual anchor for the brothers in Mozambique.

00:09:57.039 --> 00:10:03.279
Before 1991, we ended up in Mozambique, so because the brothers didn't want to get involved

00:10:03.279 --> 00:10:07.440
with it in political, and they were sent to a concentration camp.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:13.000
It was a education camp, so the government was trying to change their minds.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.919
So the life there could be very difficult, but the brothers would find a way to worship

00:10:18.919 --> 00:10:19.919
Giova.

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:25.759
They would meet secretly this example of a meeting that was held there in the middle of the

00:10:25.759 --> 00:10:27.559
forest at that time.

00:10:27.559 --> 00:10:30.720
Must have been very anxious for them, anxious moments of having to meet together in secret

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.720
like that.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:32.720
Yes.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:37.360
So at that time that singing became like a spiritual anchor for them, right at the beginning

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.879
they were singing to say courageous.

00:10:39.879 --> 00:10:44.159
In fact, the authorities were surprised because the brothers instead of crying, they were

00:10:44.159 --> 00:10:45.639
singing.

00:10:45.639 --> 00:10:52.840
And at that time, all the brothers would teach other brothers to read musical notes, and

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.960
they would memorize the songs.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:11:00.399
And when they had no Bible or some books, when they were together, they would just sing.

00:11:00.399 --> 00:11:04.639
Now that is absolutely beautiful, the power of kingdom songs, very nice.

00:11:04.639 --> 00:11:10.639
So we know after the ban in 1991, the brothers were now free to worship.

00:11:10.639 --> 00:11:14.600
So did singing continue to be an important part of their worship?

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.919
Well, that's what we wanted.

00:11:17.919 --> 00:11:21.080
Sounds like there's a story, would you mind explaining that?

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:28.080
After the ban, we had many new ones coming into the truth, but in many rural areas in Mozambique,

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:33.120
we have no electricity, no sound system, no recording of the songs.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:39.000
So at that time, it became a real challenge for the brothers to sing at the meetings.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000
What about the older ones?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.600
The ones who sang in the camps, couldn't they help the new ones?

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.720
Yes, but many of them had moved away.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.080
They were special in the cities.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:52.480
So in rural areas, there was a great need.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.720
Okay, but what about song books?

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.360
Surely you had song books?

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.080
Yes, we had them.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.639
But most could not read the musical notes.

00:11:59.639 --> 00:12:04.279
So they would sing, yes, but the melody would sound a little bit different from what we

00:12:04.279 --> 00:12:05.279
know.

00:12:05.279 --> 00:12:06.279
Yeah.

00:12:06.279 --> 00:12:12.480
So now we had freedom, they could worship and go over, but because of not having a song

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:17.759
system, they could enjoy fully the meetings, because they couldn't hear clearly what was

00:12:17.759 --> 00:12:19.480
being taught at the meetings.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.360
I must have been very discouraging, in a sense.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.879
Well, did they get the help they needed?

00:12:24.879 --> 00:12:26.639
Yes, they did.

00:12:26.639 --> 00:12:33.519
And this is the beauty of this organization, Joe Verilpec's scale of everyone in his organization.

00:12:33.519 --> 00:12:39.879
In 2011, the global passions in department found a player that would really fit for our

00:12:39.879 --> 00:12:40.879
needs.

00:12:40.879 --> 00:12:42.840
What do they call the player?

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.759
We call unity player.

00:12:44.759 --> 00:12:49.559
It comes from the idea of singing in unity with our worldwide brotherhood.

00:12:49.559 --> 00:12:52.559
Okay, unity player, what does it look like?

00:12:52.559 --> 00:12:53.559
It's not big.

00:12:53.559 --> 00:12:55.799
I have one here, can I show you?

00:12:55.799 --> 00:12:56.799
Absolutely.

00:12:56.799 --> 00:12:57.799
Here he is.

00:12:57.799 --> 00:13:02.320
I was wondering what that was, I thought it was your lung.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.279
Probably my lunch would be bigger than this.

00:13:06.279 --> 00:13:15.279
But as you can see, it's very easy to carry, very easy to operate, and it's very practical.

00:13:15.279 --> 00:13:21.639
It can be plugged in if they have power, but if they don't have power, it comes with a

00:13:21.639 --> 00:13:25.360
small solar panel, so it can be chatted by the sun.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.200
You can charge it with the sun?

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.200
Yes.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.200
Okay.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.159
And we have plenty of sun, so that's not a problem.

00:13:32.159 --> 00:13:38.679
But even if the sun fails, it comes with this hand crank, so it can be chatted manually.

00:13:38.679 --> 00:13:39.679
Chatted by hand?

00:13:39.679 --> 00:13:40.679
Exactly.

00:13:40.679 --> 00:13:41.679
Exactly.

00:13:41.679 --> 00:13:44.559
That's very useful for us there in Mozambique.

00:13:44.559 --> 00:13:51.600
And it has a little place here that you can insert a micro SD card with all the songs.

00:13:51.639 --> 00:13:54.720
So now it's just to play and sync.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.600
Very nice, but it looks like that's not all.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:00.320
Yes, it comes here with this microphone.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:05.559
So after singing, this unit play can be used as a sound system, so they can hear clearly

00:14:05.559 --> 00:14:07.600
what it's been taught at the meeting.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.559
Well, it sounds like there's a lot more than your lunch would.

00:14:10.559 --> 00:14:11.559
Exactly.

00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:12.559
You're exactly.

00:14:12.559 --> 00:14:17.399
I think it would be so neat just to be able to see a congregation when they get a unity

00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:19.039
player for the first time.

00:14:19.039 --> 00:14:21.440
Well, actually you can see that.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.440
Just take a look.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.440
OK.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:31.769
This is the Net Symbane congregation in the south part of Mozambique.

00:14:31.769 --> 00:14:39.190
Psalm 33 tells us to sync praises to Jehovah along with the shouts of joy.

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:44.669
But with no sound system, if they shout joyfully or sing full from the heart like they want

00:14:44.669 --> 00:14:48.269
to, they will not hear the music.

00:14:48.269 --> 00:14:55.009
Listening to the spiritual food can also be difficult.

00:14:55.009 --> 00:15:05.830
To help, the brothers send a request for a unity player to the branch.

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:09.950
The broadcast department tests the new player.

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:14.950
SD cards, all loaded with all of the audio and video material, are available to them in

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:17.779
shangan.

00:15:17.779 --> 00:15:32.110
Everything they need is packed inside and is soon on its way to the congregation.

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:39.470
Set up is easy and they quickly learn how to use the solar panel to charge the unit.

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:41.950
This meeting will be different.

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:49.240
Now they are able to sync to Jehovah the way their hearts move them.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:54.440
The Net Symbane congregation greatly appreciates this blessing and sends their love.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:16:06.820
It's beautiful to see the joy in their faces when they get a unity player and again they're

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:08.980
able to sing.

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:13.899
So we'll be interesting to see what new technology is available that will be able to help Jehovah's

00:16:13.899 --> 00:16:18.419
people even the remotest parts of the earth to benefit in their true worship.

00:16:18.419 --> 00:16:20.100
Thank you so much Arlindo for being with us today.

00:16:27.809 --> 00:16:33.409
Many of us have a favorite kingdom song or original song, often because it evokes in us

00:16:33.409 --> 00:16:34.850
a certain emotion.

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:40.850
When we'd like to invite some of the students to the stage now and they've specially arranged

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:44.649
and are prepared to perform for us one of our kingdom songs.

00:16:44.649 --> 00:16:50.669
Let's listen to them.

00:16:50.669 --> 00:20:57.819
The touching song and it very nicely introduces our next couple and their amazing story.

00:20:57.819 --> 00:21:12.200
Let's welcome Brother Laddie and Cecilia Sandi.

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:18.880
Brother and sister Sandi you're coming from Sierra Leone and I understand in 1997 you participated

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.880
in the construction of the branch and soon thereafter began serving there.

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:23.880
Is that correct?

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.680
Yes, very correct.

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.160
We are happily serving at the branch.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:31.440
So I understand that things didn't remain that way, did they?

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:38.160
No, things changed really quickly because our country was divided into several war and

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:44.160
then just a month after the branch dedication in rebels attacked freedom.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:46.680
So Laddie, what happened?

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:55.319
The foreign missionaries we have acquitted to a safer place in neighboring Guinea and the

00:21:55.319 --> 00:21:59.640
expatriate battleite also left the country.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.200
So who was left at the branch then, Laddie?

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.960
Just seven of us.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:09.240
Cecilia, three single brothers and a couple of myself.

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:13.400
Okay, so did you stay just the seven of you then in the branch?

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:21.960
No, things started getting worse and the brothers keep coming to the branch to seek refuge.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:28.079
We are so many, we couldn't get them all at the branch, we started distributing them

00:22:28.079 --> 00:22:31.279
to the different missionary homes in freedom.

00:22:31.279 --> 00:22:34.039
So how many were you then at the branch?

00:22:34.039 --> 00:22:39.000
We are about seven to eight brothers and sisters at the branch.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.599
Wow, that's amazing.

00:22:41.599 --> 00:22:45.440
So how, Cecilia, how did you care for all of those brothers and sisters?

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:53.160
Well, we shared a food that we had and the better family kept eating less and less.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:57.119
So our dear brothers, we had what they needed.

00:22:57.119 --> 00:23:02.279
Okay, well they look happy in that photograph, although Laddie, the picture doesn't look so

00:23:02.279 --> 00:23:03.279
good.

00:23:03.279 --> 00:23:04.279
That's true.

00:23:04.279 --> 00:23:05.279
It survived the war.

00:23:05.279 --> 00:23:07.279
That's why you have some scratches on it.

00:23:07.279 --> 00:23:09.359
Okay, right, I understand.

00:23:09.359 --> 00:23:14.359
So when you were there, Cecilia, were you able to go out at all?

00:23:14.359 --> 00:23:15.359
Yes, we did.

00:23:15.359 --> 00:23:21.160
We did our best to go out in the ministry, but before going out in the morning, we have

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:26.839
to listen to the news, the government's radio and Bush radio.

00:23:26.839 --> 00:23:31.720
Ah, okay, government radio, I understand, but Bush radio, I'm not sure I understand what

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:32.720
that is.

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:36.960
Oh, it's the news that you get by a word of mouth.

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:44.279
So the brothers will give their news, pass a buy, will give their news, and then you

00:23:44.279 --> 00:23:47.119
decide where it's safe to go that day.

00:23:47.119 --> 00:23:50.599
Okay, I get Bush radio, interesting.

00:23:50.599 --> 00:23:52.279
Did you ever feel in danger?

00:23:52.279 --> 00:23:54.400
Were you in danger at the branch?

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.400
Yes.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:24:05.160
One night, a brother and myself, we are the lobby, and two armed rebels appear demanding

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:11.000
that we open the door to them to gain access into the branch.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:17.759
So we are so frightened, we run to safety, and they start shooting at the door, the locks

00:24:17.759 --> 00:24:26.319
at the door, but the door remain firm, and they didn't think of shooting into the glass

00:24:26.319 --> 00:24:32.400
because the door has two glass, and that will help them to get easy access into the building

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.400
itself.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.400
Oh, I couldn't.

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:38.599
That was a very close call, so was that the end of it?

00:24:38.599 --> 00:24:39.599
No.

00:24:39.599 --> 00:24:45.240
Again, they jump the fence as you can see in the picture, and this time, they are about

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:50.839
20 or more, well, I'm, and they shot their way into the branch.

00:24:50.839 --> 00:24:57.559
They start looting, everything in the branch, they can lay hands on.

00:24:57.559 --> 00:24:58.559
It was a big mess.

00:24:58.559 --> 00:25:01.279
I mean, that must have been absolutely terrifying.

00:25:01.279 --> 00:25:02.279
It was.

00:25:02.279 --> 00:25:09.039
What helped is the brothers before that time, they prepared a safe room for also hiding

00:25:09.039 --> 00:25:14.799
in the case of any emergency, but that room was never my favorite.

00:25:14.799 --> 00:25:17.240
I didn't want it to go in that room.

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:19.400
Did you have another room that you thought you might like to go?

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.400
I did.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.799
I had my room that I preferred.

00:25:22.799 --> 00:25:24.799
It had food inside.

00:25:24.799 --> 00:25:28.440
It had AC inside, very nice and clean.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:31.279
It was very comfortable for me.

00:25:31.279 --> 00:25:33.519
Cecil, did you tell Ladi about that?

00:25:33.519 --> 00:25:34.759
No, I didn't tell him.

00:25:34.759 --> 00:25:37.240
I didn't mention it to anybody.

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:43.720
I just told Jehovah what I wanted to do, and I kept telling him that I hope the brothers

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:46.000
will change their decision.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.599
But why didn't you tell Ladi?

00:25:47.599 --> 00:25:54.680
I really didn't want to influence him about how I felt and what I wanted, and because

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:57.000
it was not about us.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.920
It was not about me.

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:02.359
It was about Jehovah and his people.

00:26:02.359 --> 00:26:03.759
That's very nice.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.039
Ladi was responsible for many there, and you didn't want to put that pressure on him.

00:26:08.039 --> 00:26:09.039
Very interesting.

00:26:09.039 --> 00:26:10.039
Thank you.

00:26:10.039 --> 00:26:11.559
So, Ladi, what happened now?

00:26:11.559 --> 00:26:13.480
You're down in the room.

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.480
What happened next?

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:21.079
We're in that safe room, trying very hard to see out of sight.

00:26:21.079 --> 00:26:27.000
And one of the rebels came to the door where we were hiding, trying to gain access into

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000
the door.

00:26:28.119 --> 00:26:37.240
When I was pushing at it, forcing his way, and I had one of the other men yelling at him,

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:39.079
come from that place.

00:26:39.079 --> 00:26:41.079
You seem to be too greedy.

00:26:41.079 --> 00:26:42.079
We have more than enough.

00:26:42.079 --> 00:26:43.920
Come, let's go.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.759
And they just left like that.

00:26:45.759 --> 00:26:46.880
You came out then?

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.759
No, we were still there till the following morning.

00:26:49.759 --> 00:26:52.880
It must have been terrifying there in that room.

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:56.319
So, was that the end then of troubles?

00:26:56.319 --> 00:26:58.319
No, that was not the end.

00:26:58.319 --> 00:27:05.400
The rebels also launched another operation, known as Operation Non-Living Team.

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:09.680
Hang on, Operation Non-Living Team, what would that mean, Ladi?

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:17.759
Well, this was an operation that decided to just kill anybody that comes their way.

00:27:17.759 --> 00:27:23.319
Any living team, dogs, animals, humans, being, they just spread it like that.

00:27:23.319 --> 00:27:25.319
That was the operation that was launched.

00:27:26.319 --> 00:27:30.039
You said there were other refugees in the missionary homes.

00:27:30.039 --> 00:27:33.079
How were they fairing at this time?

00:27:33.079 --> 00:27:34.559
They were not doing fine.

00:27:34.559 --> 00:27:41.240
They were suffering just like us, but we have some money with us at the branch.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:47.839
So I decided to take some money for them, because if they have money, they can get food

00:27:47.839 --> 00:27:48.839
to survive.

00:27:48.839 --> 00:27:50.640
Well, do is expensive.

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:54.559
And it was also very dangerous to take such a journey.

00:27:54.559 --> 00:27:57.319
So Cecilia decided to go with me.

00:27:57.319 --> 00:28:01.559
Cecilia, why did you decide to go with Ladi?

00:28:01.559 --> 00:28:09.960
I decided to go because I thought if Ladi was willing to die for his brothers, that's

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:15.079
what it meant for him to help them, then I might as well die with him.

00:28:15.079 --> 00:28:18.880
I didn't want them to leave to explain what happened.

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:20.480
Can you tell us, Ladi, how did what happened?

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.559
We were able to reach the missionary home.

00:28:22.559 --> 00:28:31.680
Yes, we put the money in to get a bag, and because we have seas of roadblocks, checkpoints

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:38.400
that we have to go through, and we decided to put some debti clothes and stinky rags on

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:39.400
top of the money.

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:44.519
It would prevent them from going deep down to get access to the money.

00:28:44.519 --> 00:28:49.599
And by having access to the money, they would either kill us and take the money.

00:28:49.599 --> 00:28:53.720
So we made it through several of these checkpoints.

00:28:53.720 --> 00:29:00.920
As we were approaching the missionary home, the last checkpoint there, we saw a group of

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:06.880
boys, men, women, jubilating, just jumping up and down the street.

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:07.880
You mean celebrating?

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:08.880
They were celebrating?

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:09.880
What were they celebrating?

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:14.440
Well, they were chanting that we've dropped the enemy jets, we've dropped the enemy jets,

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:17.519
we've done it again, we're happy.

00:29:17.519 --> 00:29:19.559
What did you do then to get through the checkpoint?

00:29:19.559 --> 00:29:26.559
So we started to jump up and down with them, and the strategy to just get our way through

00:29:26.559 --> 00:29:27.559
to the missionary home.

00:29:27.559 --> 00:29:29.559
So that's theocratic strategy.

00:29:29.559 --> 00:29:34.559
That's a little bit like David when he went to the city of Gah and disguised his sanity.

00:29:34.559 --> 00:29:35.559
Okay.

00:29:35.559 --> 00:29:36.559
I wonder though, how did you think of that?

00:29:36.559 --> 00:29:44.039
Well, it just came spontaneously with Jehovah Joss directed us to do that, because this

00:29:44.039 --> 00:29:48.559
was not our plan, and we were not expecting things like that to happen.

00:29:48.559 --> 00:29:49.559
Sure.

00:29:49.559 --> 00:29:53.759
Well, Jehovah helps in every situation, excellent.

00:29:53.759 --> 00:29:57.160
So you got through the checkpoint now, so what happened, you made it to the missionary

00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:58.160
home?

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.160
Yes.

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:08.599
As we are very close to the missionary home, we threw the bag into the compound, the missionary,

00:30:08.599 --> 00:30:09.599
the home.

00:30:09.599 --> 00:30:15.960
The brothers came and took the bag where we gain access safely into the missionary home,

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:20.039
delivered the money, and we tried to go back to the branch.

00:30:20.039 --> 00:30:21.960
And you were able to make it back to the branch?

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:22.960
Yes.

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:23.960
Safely.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:24.960
Yes.

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:28.400
That is an absolutely incredible story, Ladi and Cecilia, thank you so much for sharing

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.400
it with us.

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:37.079
Well, we know that in 2002, the Civil War ended, and how is Jehovah blessed, the brothers

00:30:37.079 --> 00:30:41.319
and sisters in Sierra Leone, after enduring so much, since that time?

00:30:41.319 --> 00:30:45.480
We have a video that we like to show, you want to see it?

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:46.480
I thought you might have one.

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:47.480
I'd love to see it.

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:48.480
Okay.

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.480
Let's watch.

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:57.480
Many believe that some two hundred years ago, freed American slaves founded freedom under

00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:00.440
the squatting tree.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:06.680
For nearly a hundred years, Jehovah's Witnesses have comforted people with hope of a better

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:13.700
freedom, the glorious freedom of the children of God.

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:22.180
During the 11-year civil war, 700 people were baptized, and since the war ended in 2002,

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:27.619
the number of publishers has more than doubled.

00:31:27.619 --> 00:31:33.660
Here at the branch, we welcome visitors to see how we are savage Jehovah and caring for

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:37.920
people's spiritual need.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:46.099
We have sold this once-run sack, literature has been shipped to 40 congregations.

00:31:46.099 --> 00:31:51.859
Other better lights continue to work hard for Kingdom interests.

00:31:51.859 --> 00:31:56.380
This is Edward, a hard-working brother in the Battle Office.

00:31:56.380 --> 00:32:00.819
He was one of the many who found refuge at the branch.

00:32:00.819 --> 00:32:07.420
Back then, someone told him to always remember how Jehovah protected and fed him.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:14.180
He did remember, and his selves would joy, along with his brothers and sisters in Sierra

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:26.240
Leone.

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:27.240
Thank you so much for that.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.640
Jehovah really has blessed the brothers and sisters in Sierra Leone.

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:33.799
Now you too, through your experience, you endured so much.

00:32:33.799 --> 00:32:38.279
I wonder if you could share with us what were some of the lessons that you learned from

00:32:38.279 --> 00:32:39.279
your experience?

00:32:39.279 --> 00:32:41.319
Cecilia, what would you say?

00:32:41.319 --> 00:32:43.519
For me, it's obedience.

00:32:43.519 --> 00:32:48.039
I forcefully, I force myself.

00:32:48.039 --> 00:32:53.359
To obey what the brothers said, to go in that room that I didn't like.

00:32:53.359 --> 00:33:01.359
And I'm glad I force myself to obey, because as things turn out, the room that I really,

00:33:01.359 --> 00:33:05.599
really preferred was the worst, that was damaged in the branch.

00:33:05.599 --> 00:33:11.359
The food were all taken away, they destroyed the door, the gain access inside, they destroyed

00:33:11.359 --> 00:33:17.160
the air condition, they destroyed everything beyond repair in that room.

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:19.160
Obedience saves our lives.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:24.839
Well, we're really happy to Cecilia, and I understand that that other room now is your favorite

00:33:24.839 --> 00:33:25.839
room.

00:33:25.839 --> 00:33:29.920
It is my favorite, that's where the commentary ends.

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:34.359
And I very spot where we were hiding, that's where they put the bread shop.

00:33:34.359 --> 00:33:39.599
When I collect my bread, I remember my story.

00:33:39.599 --> 00:33:43.160
Laddie, what would you say, what lesson did you learn?

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:48.759
No matter how challenging the assignments may seem, or our dangerous situation may seem,

00:33:48.759 --> 00:33:50.079
Jehovah is there.

00:33:50.079 --> 00:33:55.960
And the international brotherhood too, their prayers on our behalf help us.

00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:03.759
And if any other assignment like that comes our way, or willing to take it up, because

00:34:03.759 --> 00:34:08.639
Jehovah is there for us, and our brothers, we also pray on our behalf.

00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:12.559
Thank you so much, Laddie, and Cecilia, for sharing your beautiful experience with us.

00:34:22.579 --> 00:34:26.380
It has been a very encouraging program, and we are so happy to have been able to get

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:30.460
to know some of the members of the 144th Class of Gilead.

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:34.780
We look forward to seeing and hearing experiences of our brothers and sisters living their

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:39.460
faith of displaying courage and enduring in their service to Jehovah.

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:42.659
We thank you very much for being with us, and we look forward to seeing you on another

00:34:42.659 --> 00:34:44.420
edition of the Inside Story.
