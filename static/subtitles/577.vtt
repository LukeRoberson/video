00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:08.419
It is a privilege for me to address our worldwide brotherhood, all of you on the same day.

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:15.419
Today is what we as Jehovah's Witnesses often say is the most important day of the year.

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:20.420
Of course, it is not the same day each year on our modern calendars.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:30.420
Instead, it matches the date Jesus died according to the ancient Jewish calendar, Nyson 14.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:40.420
To start us off, we will have the text read for us by brother Mark Numer, a helper to the teaching committee of the governing body.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:48.420
Sunday, March 24th, keep doing this in remembrance of me, Luke 22, 19.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.420
Thank you, Mark. It is a short but very important scripture text.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:03.420
Interestingly, this is the same day's text that was used for the date of the memorial in 2023.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.420
You might recall that brotherhood was the chairman for the morning worship last year.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:19.420
He addressed the simple word this in the verse, and how often Jesus intended that celebrating the memorial of his death should be observed.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:29.420
If you want to add something else to your family worship this week, consider rewatching brotherhoods memorial morning worship comments from last year.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:38.420
To access it, go to jw.org and type memorial morning worship in the search bar.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.420
You can review these instructions again when trying to locate the video for family worship.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.420
Today, I would first like to comment on this simple word, me in the verse.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.420
Jesus said, keep doing this in remembrance of me.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.420
Which me do you think Jesus was primarily asking us to remember?

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.420
Was it just what he did at this very occasion?

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:13.419
No. He wanted us to remember his sacrifice, yes, but also what it meant.

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:19.419
This involved his whole existence in fulfilling Jehovah's purpose.

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:28.419
Jesus fulfilled various roles. To be specific, he first was the pre-human spirit son of God named Michael.

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:36.419
Then, by means of a miraculous transformation, he became the human son of God, Jesus Christ.

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:41.419
Later, at his death and resurrection, he became the ultimate.

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:50.419
He again became the spirit person, Michael, with the special role of being high priest and king.

00:02:50.419 --> 00:03:01.419
By his life and death as a human, he provided the basis for writing all of the wrongs and imperfection experienced since the Garden of Eden.

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:07.419
When he said, keep doing this in remembrance of me.

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:15.419
He was speaking directly to his eleven faithful apostles after the last valid Passover meal had been concluded.

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:25.419
Did he want them to remember the Jesus as the human whom they had spent time with over the past two or three years?

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:33.419
Obviously, they would never forget in a lifetime the human Jesus and how he walked and talked with them.

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:46.419
It was indelibly etched in their memories. They would always remember the miracles he performed, his teachings, and the example he left for them to follow.

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:53.419
Note, please, that at Luke 22 verse 19, it ends with the words, keep doing this.

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:57.419
That means on into the future.

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:01.419
And Jesus said those words on the night he was going to die.

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:09.419
Shortly afterward, he made a covenant with them to be with him in his future heavenly kingdom.

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:20.420
Jesus' primary reason for coming to earth was not to live as a human, but to die as a perfect human.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.420
That is the Jesus that he wanted them to remember.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.420
Please read with me on screen, Matthew 20 verse 28.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:34.420
Here he expresses what they were to remember about him.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:46.420
Just as the Son of Man came, not to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his life as a ransom in exchange for many.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:05:00.420
He did assist them when he was a human, but he wanted them and us to remember him as the Jesus who gave his life as a sacrifice that would eventually end sin and death.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:08.420
To remember him as Jesus, the one who opened the hope of everlasting life for the future.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:23.420
To remember him as the resurrected Jesus, who was now a glorious spirit creature sitting on a heavenly throne as ruling king, sitting next to his father, the sovereign of the universe.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:32.420
First Peter chapter 3 verse 18 eloquently refers to the Jesus we will all remember at the memorial tonight.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.420
Please read it with me on screen.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:44.420
For Christ died once for all time for sins, a righteous person for unrighteous ones, in order to lead you to God.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:51.420
He was put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:56.420
Jesus was made alive in the spirit, no longer a human.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.420
That is who we are remembering on this day.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:17.420
And as Jesus directed at Luke 22 verses 19 and 20, we will follow the pattern he established shortly before his death, the simple but profound pattern of passing the bread and wine and remembering him.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:26.420
About that procedure, he stated in our text for today, keep doing this in remembrance of me.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:31.800
I would now like to change our focus.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:42.800
The August 2020 issue of the watchtower had an article entitled The Resurrection Reveals God's Love, Wisdom, and Patience.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:51.800
In discussing the future resurrection of humans in the New World, it indicated that those resurrected will be easily recognized.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.800
One sentence stated,

00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:09.800
Based on resurrections that have already occurred, it seems that Jehovah will recreate people so that they look, speak, and think in the same way as they did shortly before they died.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:19.800
Otis true if they died older, they will look young and fresh, but they will be easily identified by their appearance and personality.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:26.800
Jesus himself likened death to sleep and the resurrection to being awakened from sleep.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.800
How does a person look when he wakes up in the morning?

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.800
True his hair might be must up, but he is easily recognizable.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.800
He looks the same as he did when he went to bed the night before.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.800
It was the same with all of the resurrections in the Bible.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.800
The person did not have to reintroduce himself to his family.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:52.800
He looked, spoke, and thought the same as before he died.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.800
Think of Lazarus.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:00.800
He had been dead for four days, and his body had already begun to decay.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:10.800
Yet when Jesus resurrected him, his sisters immediately recognized him, and Lazarus obviously remembered them.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:20.800
With that picture in your mind, what about Jesus when he appeared to his disciples after his resurrection?

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:29.800
Unlike one who is resurrected back to human life in the coming new world, Jesus did not take on a human body.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:36.799
You'll recall that earlier we read 1 Peter 3, verse 18, where it says of Jesus,

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:42.799
He was put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit.

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:48.799
He sacrificed that human body, the value of which was to be presented to Jehovah,

00:08:48.799 --> 00:08:52.799
allowing humans to have the hope of living forever on earth.

00:08:52.799 --> 00:08:58.799
He would not take that gift back, even temporarily.

00:08:58.799 --> 00:09:06.799
When Jesus appeared to his disciples after his resurrection, no one recognized him by his appearance.

00:09:06.799 --> 00:09:13.799
Let's look at a couple of examples, starting at John 20, verses 14 and 15, please.

00:09:13.799 --> 00:09:18.799
This involves Mary at Jesus' tomb after his resurrection.

00:09:18.799 --> 00:09:21.799
You can read it from the screen with me if you like.

00:09:21.799 --> 00:09:31.799
After saying this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not realize that it was Jesus.

00:09:31.799 --> 00:09:34.799
Jesus said to her,

00:09:34.799 --> 00:09:39.799
Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?

00:09:39.799 --> 00:09:43.799
She, thinking it was the gardener, said to him,

00:09:43.799 --> 00:09:49.799
Sir, if you have carried him off, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.

00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:55.799
Obviously, Jesus did not have the same appearance after his resurrection.

00:09:55.799 --> 00:10:00.799
He materialized the body, but not a look alike.

00:10:00.799 --> 00:10:05.799
Find Luke 24, verses 15 and 16.

00:10:05.799 --> 00:10:09.799
Two of Jesus' disciples are walking along the road.

00:10:09.799 --> 00:10:14.799
Notice what transpired in verses 15 and 16.

00:10:14.799 --> 00:10:18.799
Now, as they were conversing and discussing these things,

00:10:18.799 --> 00:10:22.799
Jesus himself approached and began walking with them,

00:10:22.799 --> 00:10:26.799
but their eyes were kept from recognizing him.

00:10:26.799 --> 00:10:34.799
How did they finally come to realize that this wise man on the road was actually the resurrected Jesus?

00:10:34.799 --> 00:10:38.799
They invited him to stay the night with them.

00:10:38.799 --> 00:10:41.799
Let's look at verses 30 and 31.

00:10:41.799 --> 00:10:50.799
And as he was dining with them, he took the bread, blessed it, broke it, and began handing it to them.

00:10:50.799 --> 00:10:58.799
At that, their eyes were fully opened, and they recognized him, but he disappeared from them.

00:10:58.799 --> 00:11:04.799
Comprehension set in when they saw his mannerisms, not his face,

00:11:04.799 --> 00:11:11.799
and then in retrospect, his speech gave away his identity, glanced at verse 32,

00:11:11.799 --> 00:11:13.799
and they said to each other,

00:11:13.799 --> 00:11:18.799
were not our hearts burning within us as he was speaking to us on the road,

00:11:18.799 --> 00:11:23.799
as he was fully opening up the scriptures to us?

00:11:23.799 --> 00:11:30.799
Within the hour, they leave that location and meet the eleven apostles and others in Jerusalem.

00:11:30.799 --> 00:11:38.799
Jesus appears again, but he evidently looks totally different from his appearance earlier that day.

00:11:38.799 --> 00:11:42.799
Dropdown to verses 36 and 37.

00:11:42.799 --> 00:11:47.799
Of Jesus, it says, while they were speaking of these things,

00:11:47.799 --> 00:11:51.799
he himself stood in their midst and said to them,

00:11:51.799 --> 00:11:54.799
may you have peace,

00:11:54.799 --> 00:12:00.799
but because they were terrified and frightened, they imagined that they were seeing a spirit.

00:12:00.799 --> 00:12:03.799
This was the same day.

00:12:03.799 --> 00:12:09.799
The disciples who had been walking on the road with him earlier that day were present,

00:12:09.799 --> 00:12:14.799
and yet he evidently looked different on the two different occasions that he appeared to them.

00:12:14.799 --> 00:12:19.799
His physical appearance was not important at that point,

00:12:19.799 --> 00:12:23.799
since it did not represent his glorious spirit body.

00:12:23.799 --> 00:12:27.799
However, since humans cannot see a spirit creature,

00:12:27.799 --> 00:12:32.799
it required Jesus to materialize a human form.

00:12:32.799 --> 00:12:37.799
In this way, they could see where he was and respond to Jesus,

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:41.799
who in reality at this point was an invisible spirit creature.

00:12:41.799 --> 00:12:45.080
The Bible does not say,

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:49.080
but can you imagine the confusion and conflict it might have caused

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:55.080
if Jesus had materialized a body that looked like his former human self?

00:12:55.080 --> 00:13:00.080
Could his disciples have suddenly been coerced into believing

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:05.080
that this was the same Jesus that they knew so well?

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:10.080
Would that have blurred the reality of him being the glorious spirit person

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:14.080
that Jesus had been transformed into?

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:16.080
Think about it.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:21.080
Jesus would shortly be exalted to a superior position,

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:29.080
superior even to the position he had in heaven before he became the human infant of a virgin,

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:33.080
and before he became the adult human son of God,

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:39.080
and the long looked for Messiah for receptive Jews of that time.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:44.080
If the materialized human body was a look-alike to his former human self,

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:49.080
might not that stir up rumors by his enemies that he really had not died

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:54.080
and thus had not been resurrected as the heavenly Son of God?

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:58.080
While we do not know those possibilities for sure,

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:05.080
we are totally confident that Jehovah was watching over his newly resurrected spirit son

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.080
and guiding him appropriately,

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.080
even as he did while Jesus walked the earth

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:15.080
as the perfect human son of God.

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:20.389
Friends, we are all looking forward to tonight.

00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:24.389
Most of us have attended the memorial of Jesus' death before.

00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:31.389
Many among us have attended 40, 50, or more times over the decades that have passed.

00:14:31.389 --> 00:14:36.389
However, we all still eagerly look forward to tonight

00:14:36.389 --> 00:14:43.389
when we will be reminded of what Jehovah and Jesus did for all of us.

00:14:43.389 --> 00:14:50.389
Yes, we keep doing this in remembrance of the glorified Jesus,

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:56.389
and all praise and honor go to His Father and our Father, Jehovah,

00:14:56.389 --> 00:15:01.389
our Savior, and the sovereign of the universe.

00:15:01.389 --> 00:15:08.389
Enjoy your day and evening together on this the most important day of the year.

00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:13.389
Mark, would you please read the Watchtower comments for today?

00:15:13.389 --> 00:15:16.389
Each year during the memorial season,

00:15:16.389 --> 00:15:19.389
we show our appreciation for what Jesus has done

00:15:19.389 --> 00:15:23.389
by taking time to meditate prayerfully on the meaning of his death.

00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:28.389
We also encourage as many as possible to join us for this special occasion,

00:15:28.389 --> 00:15:33.389
and we are determined not to allow anything to prevent us from attending the memorial.

00:15:33.389 --> 00:15:36.389
At the memorial, we learn why mankind needs a ransom,

00:15:36.389 --> 00:15:40.389
and how the death of one man can atone for the sins of many.

00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:43.389
We are reminded of what the bread and the wine represent,

00:15:43.389 --> 00:15:45.389
and who should partake of them,

00:15:45.389 --> 00:15:50.389
and we meditate on the blessings that are in store for those who cherish the earthly hope.

00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:54.389
We should not take these truths for granted.

00:15:54.389 --> 00:15:56.389
Thank you, Mark.

00:15:56.389 --> 00:16:01.389
It is now time to continue with the memorial Bible reading that we have been contemplating

00:16:01.389 --> 00:16:03.389
for the past few days.

00:16:03.389 --> 00:16:07.389
The verses to be read will appear on screen,

00:16:07.389 --> 00:16:14.940
and you will hear the reading in your own language.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.940
Now, on the first day of the unleavened bread,

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:21.940
when they customarily offered up the Passover sacrifice,

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:24.940
His disciples said to him,

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:28.940
where do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:33.940
With that, He sent two of His disciples and said to them,

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:39.940
go into the city, and a man carrying an earthenware water jar will meet you.

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:45.940
Follow Him, and wherever He goes inside, say to the master of the house,

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:51.940
the teacher says, where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:56.940
And He will show you a large upper room furnished and ready.

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:58.940
Prepare it for us there.

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:02.940
So the disciples went out, and they entered the city,

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:05.940
and found it just as He said to them,

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.940
and they prepared for the Passover.

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:17.309
On the first day of the unleavened bread,

00:17:17.309 --> 00:17:20.309
the disciples came to Jesus, saying,

00:17:20.309 --> 00:17:24.309
where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?

00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:25.309
He said,

00:17:25.309 --> 00:17:29.309
go into the city to sow and sow, and say to Him,

00:17:29.309 --> 00:17:31.309
the teacher says,

00:17:31.309 --> 00:17:33.309
my appointed time is near.

00:17:33.309 --> 00:17:38.309
I will celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your home.

00:17:38.309 --> 00:17:41.309
So the disciples did as Jesus instructed them,

00:17:41.309 --> 00:17:43.309
and prepared for the Passover.

00:17:43.309 --> 00:17:53.500
After evening had fallen, He came with the twelve.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:57.500
And as they were reclining at the table and eating,

00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.500
Jesus said,

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.500
truly I say to you,

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:06.500
one of you who is eating with me will betray me.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.500
They began to be grieved,

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:10.500
and to say to Him,

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.500
one by one,

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:15.500
it is not I, is it?

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.500
He said to them,

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.500
it is one of the twelve,

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.500
the one dipping with me into the bowl.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.500
For the Son of Man is going away,

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.500
just as it is written about Him,

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.500
but woe to that man

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:33.500
through whom the Son of Man is betrayed.

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.500
It would have been better for that man

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:38.500
if he had not been born.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.500
And as they continued eating,

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.500
he took a loaf,

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.500
said a blessing,

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:46.500
broke it,

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.500
and gave it to them,

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:49.500
saying,

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:50.500
take it,

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.500
this means my body.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.500
And taking a cup,

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.500
He offered thanks and gave it to them,

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.500
and they all drank out of it.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.500
And He said to them,

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.500
this means my blood of the covenant,

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:10.500
which is to be poured out in behalf of many.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.500
Truly I say to you,

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:16.500
I will by no means drink any more of the product of the vine,

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.500
until that day when I drink it new

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:23.700
in the kingdom of God.

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:27.700
Finally, after singing praises,

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:35.859
they went out to the Mount of Olives,

00:19:35.859 --> 00:19:38.859
and Jesus said to them,

00:19:38.859 --> 00:19:42.859
you will all be stumbled for it is written.

00:19:42.859 --> 00:19:44.859
I will strike the shepherd

00:19:44.859 --> 00:19:47.859
and the sheep will be scattered about.

00:19:47.859 --> 00:19:49.859
But after I have been raised up,

00:19:49.859 --> 00:19:52.859
I will go ahead of you into Galilee.

00:19:52.859 --> 00:19:55.859
But Peter said to him,

00:19:55.859 --> 00:19:57.859
even if all the others are stumbled,

00:19:57.859 --> 00:19:59.859
I will not be.

00:19:59.859 --> 00:20:02.859
At that, Jesus said to him,

00:20:02.859 --> 00:20:05.859
truly I say to you that today,

00:20:05.859 --> 00:20:07.859
yes, on this very night,

00:20:07.859 --> 00:20:10.859
before a rooster crows twice,

00:20:10.859 --> 00:20:14.859
you will disown me three times.

00:20:14.859 --> 00:20:17.859
But He kept insisting,

00:20:17.859 --> 00:20:19.859
if I have to die with you,

00:20:19.859 --> 00:20:22.859
I will by no means disown you.

00:20:22.859 --> 00:20:26.859
Also, all the others began to say the same thing,

00:20:26.859 --> 00:20:36.589
so they came to a spot named Gethsemane,

00:20:36.589 --> 00:20:39.589
and He said to His disciples,

00:20:39.589 --> 00:20:42.589
sit down here while I pray.

00:20:42.589 --> 00:20:45.589
And He took Peter and James

00:20:45.589 --> 00:20:47.589
and John along with Him,

00:20:47.589 --> 00:20:50.589
and He began to feel deeply distressed

00:20:50.589 --> 00:20:53.589
and to be greatly troubled.

00:20:53.589 --> 00:20:55.589
He said to them,

00:20:55.589 --> 00:20:58.589
I am deeply grieved,

00:20:58.589 --> 00:21:00.589
even to death.

00:21:00.589 --> 00:21:04.589
Stay here and keep on the watch.

00:21:04.589 --> 00:21:07.589
And going a little way forward,

00:21:07.589 --> 00:21:09.589
He fell to the ground

00:21:09.589 --> 00:21:11.589
and began praying that,

00:21:11.589 --> 00:21:13.589
if it were possible,

00:21:13.589 --> 00:21:17.589
the hour might pass away from Him.

00:21:17.589 --> 00:21:19.589
And He said,

00:21:19.589 --> 00:21:21.589
Abba, Father,

00:21:21.589 --> 00:21:24.589
all things are possible for you.

00:21:24.589 --> 00:21:27.589
Remove this cup from me.

00:21:27.589 --> 00:21:30.589
Yet not what I want,

00:21:30.589 --> 00:21:33.589
but what you want.

00:21:33.589 --> 00:21:36.589
He returned and found them sleeping,

00:21:36.589 --> 00:21:39.589
and He said to Peter,

00:21:39.589 --> 00:21:42.589
Simon, are you sleeping?

00:21:42.589 --> 00:21:44.589
Did you not have the strength

00:21:44.589 --> 00:21:46.589
to keep on the watch for one hour?

00:21:46.589 --> 00:21:48.589
Keep on the watch,

00:21:48.589 --> 00:21:50.589
and pray continually,

00:21:50.589 --> 00:21:53.589
so that you do not come into temptation.

00:21:53.589 --> 00:21:56.589
The Spirit, of course, is eager,

00:21:56.589 --> 00:21:59.589
but the flesh is weak.

00:21:59.589 --> 00:22:02.589
And He went away again and prayed,

00:22:02.589 --> 00:22:05.589
saying the same thing.

00:22:05.589 --> 00:22:07.589
And He came again,

00:22:07.589 --> 00:22:09.589
and found them sleeping,

00:22:09.589 --> 00:22:11.589
for their eyes were weighed down,

00:22:11.589 --> 00:22:15.589
so they did not know what to answer Him.

00:22:15.589 --> 00:22:18.589
And He returned the third time,

00:22:18.589 --> 00:22:20.589
and said to them,

00:22:20.589 --> 00:22:22.589
At such a time as this,

00:22:22.589 --> 00:22:25.589
you are sleeping and resting.

00:22:25.589 --> 00:22:27.589
It is enough.

00:22:27.589 --> 00:22:29.589
The hour has come.

00:22:29.589 --> 00:22:31.589
Look, the Son of Man

00:22:31.589 --> 00:22:34.589
is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.

00:22:34.589 --> 00:22:37.589
Get up, let us go.

00:22:37.589 --> 00:22:41.589
Look, my betrayer has drawn near.

00:22:41.589 --> 00:22:43.589
And immediately,

00:22:43.589 --> 00:22:45.589
while He was still speaking,

00:22:45.589 --> 00:22:48.589
Judas, one of the twelve arrived,

00:22:48.589 --> 00:22:50.589
and with Him a crowd,

00:22:50.589 --> 00:22:53.589
with swords and clubs,

00:22:53.589 --> 00:22:55.589
sent from the chief priests,

00:22:55.589 --> 00:22:58.589
and the scribes, and the elders.

00:22:58.589 --> 00:23:02.589
Now His betrayer had given them an agreed sign,

00:23:02.589 --> 00:23:04.589
saying,

00:23:04.589 --> 00:23:06.589
Whoever it is I kiss,

00:23:06.589 --> 00:23:08.589
He is the one.

00:23:08.589 --> 00:23:10.589
Take Him into custody,

00:23:10.589 --> 00:23:13.589
and lead Him away under guard.

00:23:13.589 --> 00:23:15.589
And He came straight up,

00:23:15.589 --> 00:23:17.589
and approached Him,

00:23:17.589 --> 00:23:19.589
and said,

00:23:20.589 --> 00:23:23.589
And gave Him a tender kiss,

00:23:23.589 --> 00:23:25.589
so they seized Him

00:23:25.589 --> 00:23:28.589
and took Him into custody.

00:23:28.589 --> 00:23:31.589
However, one of those standing by,

00:23:31.589 --> 00:23:32.589
drew His sword,

00:23:32.589 --> 00:23:35.589
and struck the slave of the high priest,

00:23:35.589 --> 00:23:38.589
taking off his ear.

00:23:38.589 --> 00:23:40.589
But in response,

00:23:40.589 --> 00:23:43.589
Jesus said to them,

00:23:43.589 --> 00:23:45.589
Did you come out to arrest me

00:23:45.589 --> 00:23:47.589
with swords and clubs,

00:23:47.589 --> 00:23:49.589
as against a robber?

00:23:49.589 --> 00:23:50.589
Day after day,

00:23:50.589 --> 00:23:53.589
I was with you in the temple teaching,

00:23:53.589 --> 00:23:56.589
and yet you did not take me into custody.

00:23:56.589 --> 00:23:57.589
Nevertheless,

00:23:57.589 --> 00:24:01.589
this is to fulfill the scriptures.

00:24:01.589 --> 00:24:04.589
And they all abandoned Him,

00:24:04.589 --> 00:24:11.380
and fled.

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:12.380
However,

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:14.380
a certain young man wearing

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:16.380
only a fine linen garment

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:18.380
over his naked body,

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:21.380
began to follow Him nearby,

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:23.380
and then they tried to seize Him,

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:26.380
but He left His linen garment behind,

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:36.029
and got away naked.

00:24:36.029 --> 00:24:41.029
They now led Jesus away to the high priest.

00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:43.029
And all the chief priests,

00:24:43.029 --> 00:24:44.029
and the elders,

00:24:44.029 --> 00:24:45.029
and the scribes,

00:24:45.029 --> 00:24:47.029
assembled.

00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:48.029
But Peter,

00:24:48.029 --> 00:24:50.029
from a good distance,

00:24:50.029 --> 00:24:53.029
followed Him as far as into the courtyard

00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:54.029
of the high priest,

00:24:54.029 --> 00:24:56.029
and He was sitting together

00:24:56.029 --> 00:24:58.029
with the house attendants,

00:24:58.029 --> 00:25:00.029
and warming Himself

00:25:00.029 --> 00:25:02.029
before a bright fire.

00:25:02.029 --> 00:25:04.029
Now, the chief priests,

00:25:04.029 --> 00:25:06.029
and the entire Sanhedrin,

00:25:06.029 --> 00:25:09.029
were looking for testimony against Jesus

00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:11.029
in order to put Him to death,

00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:13.029
but they were not finding any.

00:25:13.029 --> 00:25:18.029
Many indeed were giving false witness against Him,

00:25:18.029 --> 00:25:22.029
but their testimonies were not in agreement.

00:25:22.029 --> 00:25:25.029
Also, certain ones were standing up,

00:25:25.029 --> 00:25:27.029
wearing false witness against Him,

00:25:27.029 --> 00:25:28.029
saying,

00:25:28.029 --> 00:25:30.029
We heard Him say,

00:25:30.029 --> 00:25:32.029
I will throw down this temple

00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:34.029
that was made with hands,

00:25:34.029 --> 00:25:36.029
and in three days,

00:25:36.029 --> 00:25:39.029
I will build another not made with hands.

00:25:39.029 --> 00:25:42.029
But even on these grounds,

00:25:42.029 --> 00:25:46.029
their testimony was not in agreement.

00:25:46.029 --> 00:25:49.029
Then the high priest stood up in their midst,

00:25:49.029 --> 00:25:51.029
and questioned Jesus,

00:25:51.029 --> 00:25:52.029
saying,

00:25:52.029 --> 00:25:54.029
Do you say nothing in reply?

00:25:54.029 --> 00:25:58.029
What is it these men are testifying against you?

00:25:58.029 --> 00:26:01.029
But He kept silent,

00:26:01.029 --> 00:26:04.029
and made no reply at all.

00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:07.029
Again, the high priest began to question Him,

00:26:07.029 --> 00:26:09.029
and said to Him,

00:26:09.029 --> 00:26:11.029
Are you the Christ,

00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:14.029
the Son of the Blessed One?

00:26:14.029 --> 00:26:17.029
Then Jesus said,

00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:19.029
I am,

00:26:19.029 --> 00:26:21.029
and you will see the Son of Man

00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:23.029
sitting at the right hand of power,

00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:26.029
and coming with the clouds of heaven.

00:26:26.029 --> 00:26:32.029
At this, the high priest ripped his garments and said,

00:26:32.029 --> 00:26:35.029
What further need do we have of witnesses?

00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:37.029
You heard the blasphemy.

00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:40.029
What is your decision?

00:26:40.029 --> 00:26:45.029
They all condemned Him as deserving of death,

00:26:45.029 --> 00:26:48.029
and some started to spit on Him,

00:26:48.029 --> 00:26:50.029
and to cover His face,

00:26:50.029 --> 00:26:52.029
and hit Him with their fists,

00:26:52.029 --> 00:26:54.029
and say to Him,

00:26:54.029 --> 00:26:56.029
Prophecy!

00:26:56.029 --> 00:26:58.029
And slapping Him in the face,

00:26:58.029 --> 00:27:01.029
the court attendance took Him.

00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:05.859
Now while Peter was below in the court yard,

00:27:05.859 --> 00:27:09.859
one of the servant girls of the high priest came.

00:27:09.859 --> 00:27:12.859
On seeing Peter warming himself,

00:27:12.859 --> 00:27:16.859
she looked straight at Him and said,

00:27:16.859 --> 00:27:18.859
You too are with the Nazarene,

00:27:18.859 --> 00:27:20.859
this Jesus.

00:27:21.859 --> 00:27:24.859
But He denied it, saying,

00:27:24.859 --> 00:27:26.859
Neither do I know Him,

00:27:26.859 --> 00:27:29.859
nor do I understand what you are talking about.

00:27:29.859 --> 00:27:32.859
And He went outside to the entryway.

00:27:32.859 --> 00:27:35.859
There, the servant girls saw Him,

00:27:35.859 --> 00:27:39.859
and again began to say to those standing by,

00:27:39.859 --> 00:27:41.859
This is one of them.

00:27:41.859 --> 00:27:44.859
Again, He was denying it.

00:27:44.859 --> 00:27:46.859
And after a little while,

00:27:46.859 --> 00:27:50.859
those standing by again began saying to Peter.

00:27:50.859 --> 00:27:53.859
Certainly, you are one of them,

00:27:53.859 --> 00:27:57.859
for you are, in fact, a Galilean.

00:27:57.859 --> 00:28:00.859
But He started to curse and swear,

00:28:00.859 --> 00:28:04.859
I do not know this man of whom you speak.

00:28:04.859 --> 00:28:09.859
Immediately, a rooster crowed a second time,

00:28:09.859 --> 00:28:14.859
and Peter recalled what Jesus had said to Him,

00:28:14.859 --> 00:28:17.859
Before a rooster crowed twice,

00:28:17.859 --> 00:28:21.859
You will disown me three times.

00:28:21.859 --> 00:28:25.859
And He broke down and began to weep.

00:28:25.859 --> 00:28:41.559
In conclusion, friends,

00:28:41.559 --> 00:28:45.559
we want you to know that we love all of you very much.

00:28:45.559 --> 00:28:48.559
Please use this memorial occasion

00:28:48.559 --> 00:28:52.559
to draw closer to our loving Heavenly Father,

00:28:52.559 --> 00:28:54.559
to His dear Son,

00:28:54.559 --> 00:28:56.559
and to one another.
