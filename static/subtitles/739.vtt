00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.780
Have you ever had to sue for peace?

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.780
Why are you thinking of the question?

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.779
Would you please turn with me to Luke chapter 14?

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:16.780
I'd like to put you and me in the middle of one of Jesus' illustrations.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:22.780
Jesus has been talking about what it costs to become one of his disciples.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.780
And then, in verse 31, he says,

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.780
or, what king?

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.780
This is where we come in.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:36.780
What king marching out against another king in war does not first sit down and take counsel

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.780
whether he's able with 10,000 troops to stand up to the one who comes against him with 20,000.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.780
If, in fact, he cannot do so, then while that one is yet far away,

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.780
he sends out a body of ambassadors and sues for peace.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.250
How do you think their conversation goes?

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.250
Now, I want peace, and these are my terms.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.250
Hardly.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.250
It's more like, I don't want to be your enemy.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.250
Please, tell me what to do so that I can have peace with you.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.250
Now, with that in mind, Jesus gives the application, verse 33.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:31.250
In the same way, you may be sure that not one of you who does not say goodbye to all his belongings can be my disciple.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.689
That is you and me.

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.689
We got to the point where we realized we did not want to be an enemy of Jehovah.

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:47.689
And so we were willing to sacrifice everything, belongings, career, status, everything

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:53.689
for the privilege of being a peace with Jehovah and a disciple of his son.

00:01:53.689 --> 00:02:01.689
Now, for you students of Class 150, your pursuit of peace with Jehovah has led you into the special full-time service.

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:07.689
And what a beautiful record every one of you has set.

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:16.689
You remind me, in many ways, of a group in the Bible that literally sued for peace.

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:19.689
And their story is told in the book of Joshua, chapter 9.

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:21.689
That's right.

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.689
We're talking about the Gibbianites.

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:26.689
Do you have Joshua, chapter 9?

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:34.689
They had heard of all the things that Jehovah had done for his people Israel and to his enemies.

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:37.689
They did not want to be Jehovah's enemy.

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:41.689
And so they did exactly what the King and Jesus illustration did.

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:44.689
They sent a body of ambassadors.

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:47.689
So Joshua, chapter 9.

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:54.689
And this is the opening overture in verse 6.

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:57.689
We have come from a distant land.

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:00.689
Now, make a covenant with us.

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:07.689
When they didn't get a very warm initial reception, they persisted, verse 8.

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:10.689
We are your servants.

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:12.689
In other words, set the terms.

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:14.689
We want peace.

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:23.689
They were willing to sacrifice everything in order to enjoy peace with Israel and with Israel's God.

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:33.689
Now, Joshua and the Chieftains didn't see it exactly the same way, particularly when they found out that they were not from a distant land as they had claimed.

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:35.689
Nobody likes to be fooled.

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:38.689
So the tone got a little stoner.

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:41.689
Let's turn, look at verse 23.

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:42.689
This is what they said.

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:53.689
From now on, you are cursed and you will always occupy a slave's position as gatherers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:56.689
What will it give me and I say to that?

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:58.689
25.

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:06.689
We are at your mercy due to us whatever you think is good and bright.

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:11.689
And just so, the terms of peace were set, verse 27.

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:25.689
That day, Joshua made them gatherers of wood and drawers of water for the assembly and for Jehovah's altar at the place that he should choose and they remain so to this day.

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:28.689
So now, a few questions, a few lessons.

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:32.689
What do you think of the Ghiblianites assignment?

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:35.689
It was presented to them as a punishment.

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:37.689
But just think.

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:40.689
There would have been sold off as household slaves.

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:49.689
Their humble service would directly contribute to pure worship and support Jehovah's people.

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:51.689
That's a privilege, isn't it?

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:56.689
I mean, that's the kind of service we reach out for as a privilege.

00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:01.540
Now, the kind of service.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.540
Was it because they were lowly people?

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.540
No skills to do anything else that they were given this kind of job.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:15.540
Well, look at chapter 10 and verse 2.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.540
Kind of people, the Ghiblianites were.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.540
Ghiblian was a great city like one of the royal cities.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:29.110
It was greater than AI and all its men were warriors.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.110
Capable, skilled people.

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:40.110
However, clearly the Ghiblianites realized that if their army was no match for Israel,

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:46.110
then Jehovah didn't need them to bolster his army in order to complete the conquest.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:53.110
It was better for them to ask Jehovah what he wanted them to do and to do that.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:58.110
So the sacrifice was definitely worth it.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:05.110
Does that mean, though, that their skills were irrelevant, never even considered?

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:06.110
Oh, no.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.110
But for example, a few hundred years later,

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:15.110
Ishmaja the Ghiblianite is listed among David's 30 mighty men.

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.110
Different needs, calls for different skills.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.110
What did Ishmaja do with his skill?

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.110
Well, he humbly defended pure worship and Jehovah's people.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.110
So the details of the assignment were different,

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.480
but the focus was about the same.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.480
Another question.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:42.480
Was this just a short term starter assignment?

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.480
Yeah, we'll do this for now, but once the campaign is over,

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:51.819
we'll be able to resume our regular place in society.

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:54.819
Well, back to verse 27 of chapter 9.

00:06:54.819 --> 00:06:59.819
Remember what Joshua said at this point when he gave them their assignment?

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:03.819
They remain so to this day.

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:08.819
Not only to the day that Joshua wrote these words,

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:11.819
about 900 years later,

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:17.819
among the exiles that returned from Babylon to Jerusalem to restore pure worship,

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:20.819
were temple servants.

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:25.819
And likely, this included descendants of the Ghiblianites.

00:07:25.819 --> 00:07:29.819
Just think these temple servants, once again,

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:33.819
were willing to leave behind the life that they'd built up

00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:38.819
to make the track and be half of pure worship and take up their duties.

00:07:38.819 --> 00:07:42.819
They must have really cherished their assignment

00:07:42.819 --> 00:07:48.290
in order to stick to it that way.

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:52.290
So as we've talked about them, have you been noting some personal lessons?

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:56.290
These are the four that come to my mind.

00:07:56.290 --> 00:08:02.290
Number one, as with the King in Jesus' illustration and the Ghiblianites,

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:06.290
peace with Jehovah is such a treasure.

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:10.290
We're willing to sacrifice anything to enjoy it.

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:17.290
Number two, Jehovah's terms for us include humble service

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:21.290
on behalf of pure worship and in support of his people.

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:27.290
And that kind of humble service we view as the greatest privilege.

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:31.290
Number three, different needs call for different skills.

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:38.289
And that may lead to a change of assignment for you or for someone else.

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:42.289
Either way, we don't compete, we don't compare.

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:45.289
The details of the assignment may be different,

00:08:45.289 --> 00:08:48.289
but the focus or goal is always the same.

00:08:48.289 --> 00:08:53.289
And the fourth one, we cherish our assignment.

00:08:53.289 --> 00:08:58.289
We're going to stay in it as long as Jehovah allows.

00:08:58.289 --> 00:09:02.289
In short, we cherish our assignment.

00:09:02.289 --> 00:09:04.289
We love our God.

00:09:04.289 --> 00:09:09.289
Peace with Jehovah is a treasure that we will never let go.
