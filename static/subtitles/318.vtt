00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:45.469
Respect, sometimes we work so hard to show it, but receive little in return.

00:00:45.469 --> 00:01:02.149
The question is, does it really have to be that way at home?

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:15.049
We might need to change habits that we learn growing up, or we may realize that we need

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.890
to change our choice of entertainment.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:27.129
While it may not be easy, it is possible to cultivate the mutual respect we once had.

00:01:27.129 --> 00:01:31.129
A helpful principle was stated long ago in the Bible.

00:01:31.129 --> 00:01:43.340
Just as you want others to do to you, do the same way to them.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:02:08.919
Husbands especially need to feel respected, but wives also need to feel valued, loved,

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.879
heard by their husbands.

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:18.039
If we start by doing things that show we honor our mate, we'll create an atmosphere

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:31.710
where respect can grow.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:45.379
Always remember to consider how your words will affect your mate, whether in public or

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:48.870
even in private.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.110
If you must correct a matter, wait until you're alone.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.949
Use a kind tone and gentle speech.

00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:15.009
Even when you disagree, keep showing that you value your mate's opinion.

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:25.860
Think about everything your spouse does, both the big things and the little things.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:50.610
To take good care of your family, try not to focus on your mate's flaws, command more than

00:03:50.610 --> 00:04:16.649
you criticize, and tell your mate every day something specific you appreciate about them.

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:22.689
Peace is the beautiful result when both husband and wife show respect to the person who deserves

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:24.649
it most.

00:04:24.649 --> 00:04:27.649
One another.

00:04:27.649 --> 00:04:34.089
Here are three questions for you to discuss that can help to build respect in your marriage.

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:38.810
This is simply a chance to openly express how each of you feels.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.689
Be ready to listen and willing to change.

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:47.810
So if it's convenient, pause this video now and really talk.
