00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:07.379
If you told me two years ago that I'd be moving where the need was greater, I would have laughed.

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:16.600
It all started when they announced a special preaching campaign.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.600
My friend Samuel encouraged me to apply with him.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.600
So, what'd you think?

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.079
Er, yeah.

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:27.440
No, but you enjoy that.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.239
I know you're gonna love it. That's why I got you a form as well.

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:32.240
All right, we can do this.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.240
Okay.

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:40.469
I knew I could do more, but I was comfortable.

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.350
I like doing things on my own terms.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.189
But really, I was afraid of the unknown.

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:53.240
I needed to examine my heart.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.560
When I read about Abraham's faith at Hebrews 11-8,

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.439
it's like the words jumped off the page.

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:07.560
He went out, although not knowing where he was going.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.640
Who better to be in control of my life than Jehovah?

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.319
A door was open to me.

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:17.480
I just needed to go through it.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:28.299
And what I experienced changed my life.

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:31.659
The results of the campaign were incredible.

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.780
And the experience pushed me out of my comfort zone.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:45.700
All right, Gabe, I'm gonna trust you.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:14.069
I saw the ministry in a new way, and I wanted to do more.

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.659
So I calculated the cost and worked with my local elders

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:21.580
to write to the branch office.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:37.819
When I heard back with some suggestions,

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.780
I prayed about it and did research before choosing.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.259
There were many unknowns, but I couldn't wait.

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:52.250
It was hard to say goodbye to my friends,

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.250
but I was ready for whatever Jehovah had installed me.
