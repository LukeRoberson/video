00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:12.310
So, how do we know that Jesus did not become king when he was on earth

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.309
or immediately after he was resurrected?

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:22.300
Oh, because he didn't.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.440
Well, what did Jesus teach his disciples to pray?

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.899
Oh, yeah, well, I know the obvious.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.899
Let your kingdom come, implied future tents.

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.899
But how come you know for sure what's going on in heaven?

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:49.009
Maybe it would help if we reviewed the sighted scriptures here?

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:56.399
Before you leave, a suggestion.

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.399
Maybe you were to study ahead of time.

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.399
How about no?

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:02.399
I'm really swamped.

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.400
I know you're busy.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.400
We all are.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.400
You have no clue, do you?

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.400
I gotta go.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:18.500
I didn't know what to do next.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.500
I thought she was making our study a priority,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.500
but maybe she wasn't.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:59.019
Next week, it's dual die time.

00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:03.019
Then, I remembered 1 Corinthians 3 verse 6

00:02:03.019 --> 00:02:06.019
that God keeps making it grow.

00:02:06.019 --> 00:02:19.069
So I asked him to help Jade.

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.069
Then left it with him.

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:47.139
Look, I need to apologize.

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:49.139
Forget it.

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:51.139
You were stressed.

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:53.139
Yeah, but there's more.

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:55.139
Inside, I knew you were right.

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:58.139
It's just the last thing I wanted to stop.

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:00.139
Really?

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:17.240
How about I show you how I prepare?

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.240
Okay.
