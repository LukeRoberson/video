00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.780
Located in the Western Pacific Ocean, the Mariana

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.380
Trinch is the deepest known location on Earth.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.080
To help you get an idea of its depth, imagine that you

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.879
could stack the Empire State Building in the Trinch.

00:00:19.879 --> 00:00:23.980
It would take 25 such buildings to go from the bottom of the

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.480
Trinch before you would reach sea level.

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.479
It is also one of the deadliest places on Earth.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:33.880
Why is it?

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.579
In a word, pressure.

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:39.679
The crushing pressure, water pressure on the floor of the

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:43.880
Trinch is more than eight tons per square inch.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.479
Now to give you some idea that would be the equivalent of

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:53.079
having about 50 jumbo jets on top of you.

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.679
Surely no life could live in that Trinch.

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:01.280
At least that's what scientists thought.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.780
But they were wrong.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.280
When they finally developed a submersible that would take

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.680
them down into the Trinch, they found life teaming and not

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.180
just surviving, but thriving.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.379
Now, how is that possible?

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:23.680
It's possible, friends, because Jehovah, our creator,

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.280
knows how to deal with pressure.

00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:31.180
Jehovah knows how to deal with pressure.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.680
And this is a fact that should be comforting to all of

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.879
us, why?

00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:40.379
Because the pressure in this system of things is increasing,

00:01:40.379 --> 00:01:45.980
strain, stress, anxiety for all people at all levels.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.079
And the Bible tells us that these pressures are likely to

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.579
increase in the near future.

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:54.879
But the good news is that Jehovah does more than just

00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:57.879
equip his servants to survive.

00:01:57.879 --> 00:02:02.079
You can actually make one thrive.

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:03.780
Here's an example.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.480
Try this on for pressure.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.780
You're surrounded by men who hate you.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.280
In addition to hunting you down with a view to taking

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.780
your life, they've spread the slander and lies about you

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:18.979
everywhere.

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:22.180
Your name has become a reproach.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.379
When people see you coming, they turn and run the

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.879
other way because they feel that your time is short

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:33.479
and they don't want to be caught in the crosshairs.

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:38.080
Wherever you look, it seems like terror is waiting for you.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.080
And as a result of these problems, you're struggling

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.180
with depression.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.879
Your own sins are staring you in the face.

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.780
The whole experience has taken a toll on your health.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:48.680
You can't sleep.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.580
Your stamina is shot.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.379
Your body is wasting away.

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.080
Now, that was David's situation.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.479
And you can read about it in Psalm 31 verses 10 through 13.

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:04.879
The pressure was real.

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:06.280
No question about it.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.180
David's feelings were real.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.479
No question about that.

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:14.580
But something else was very real.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.580
And that was Jehovah.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.479
And so Jehovah is where David would turn to.

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:28.449
Let's turn to his words in Psalm 31.

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:35.349
Psalm 31, and note his humble prayer beginning in verse 14.

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.250
He said, but I trust in you, O Jehovah.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.650
I declare you are my God.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.550
My days are in your hand.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.050
Rescue me from the hand of my enemies and from those

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.650
persecuting me.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.650
Make your face shine upon your servant.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.539
Save me by your loyal love.

00:03:56.539 --> 00:04:01.340
David's life experiences had taught him the value of turning

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.240
to God and pouring out his heart in times of trial.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.840
And he absolutely knew that prayer coupled with implicit

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.839
trust and patience would always bring Jehovah's blessing.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:21.240
And you see, friends, the key to not just surviving,

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.540
but thriving under extreme pressure

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:30.639
is to have the internal pressure equal to the external.

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.839
And when this is true, there is no amount of pressure

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:37.139
that can crush you.

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.439
So in a spiritual sense, and David received the internal

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:46.139
fortitude, or at some say, the intestinal fortitude,

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.139
meaning the courage and the strength that would make him equal

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.540
to the pressure weighing in on him.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.540
And how do we know that he received that?

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.540
Well, let's go back to Psalm 31 for just a moment.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:05.740
If you look at verse 21, notice now the change.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.540
He says, it made Jehovah be praised

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.240
for in a wonderful way he has shown his loyal love to me

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.540
in a besieged city.

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:18.939
And then verse 23, love Jehovah.

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:23.240
All you who are loyal to him, Jehovah protects the faithful

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.740
and finally, verse 24, be courageous

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.939
and may your heart be strong.

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:34.220
All you who are waiting for Jehovah.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:39.220
So you see, David received an answer to his prayer.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.620
He, his prayer, coupled with his faith and his patience.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.620
He was waiting on Jehovah and Jehovah helped him not only

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.620
to survive, but to thrive.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.819
And he added joy to David.

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:58.819
Because David went on to find joy and happiness

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:01.819
in his responsibilities and privileges.

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:03.819
So what do we learn?

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:05.819
Number one.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.420
David was able to face the pressure

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.420
because he had an unshakable faith in Jehovah.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:16.220
And number two, David's relationship with Jehovah

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.420
brought him the patience to wait on God.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.819
And number three, when a loyal servant of God

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:26.420
humbly turns to Jehovah for help,

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.420
it is Jehovah's own loyal love

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.420
that has the effect of equalizing the pressure.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.699
And you know there's something else.

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:40.699
David's experience in the trench

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:43.500
reached further than he ever knew.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.899
Jonah, while in the belly of the great fish,

00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:50.899
cited words from Psalm 31.

00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:54.899
Jeremiah, who had many trials

00:06:54.899 --> 00:06:58.699
sometimes in his life, often echoed phrases

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:01.300
from Psalm 31.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:06.300
And Jesus Christ himself, the very son of God,

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.300
his final words from the stake,

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.300
was a quotation from Psalm 31-5.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:15.300
So Jesus must have meditated on this many times.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:19.300
And so friends like David, Jonah, Jeremiah, Jesus,

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:24.300
and many, many others, they all trusted in Jehovah

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.300
and Jehovah never failed to make them equal to the pressure.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.300
He'll do the same for you.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.300
And so in conclusion, you see,

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.300
it really doesn't matter how great the pressure is.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:42.300
It only matters where the pressure lies.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:47.300
Do not let it come between you and Jehovah

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.300
and your worship and service.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.300
Don't let it come between you.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.300
Because then the external pressure

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.300
will only continue to move you closer

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.300
to your Heavenly Father.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:05.300
The life that flourishes in the Maryana trench gives

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.300
a positive example, a beautiful example

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.300
of Jehovah's limitless ability

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.300
to help his creation deal with pressure.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.300
Prayer, trust, and patience

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.300
will always be rewarded by Jehovah.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:24.300
Relief will be rewarded by Jehovah.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.300
Relief will come.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.300
So remain close to your Heavenly Father

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:35.299
and you will not just survive the pressure in the trench.

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:38.299
You will thrive spiritually.
