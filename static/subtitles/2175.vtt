00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:13.519
Why was it difficult to choose a career?

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.519
Most of my family have a university degree.

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:20.519
Some are lawyers, engineers, accountants, and so on.

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.519
So they expected me to go to university as well.

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.519
They told me, we don't have a doctor in the family yet.

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.519
We think you should study medicine.

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.520
When I was 16, I was about to leave high school.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.520
Many of my schoolmates were planning to study at university

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.520
and would say things like, I want to go to this school.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.520
Which one are you going to?

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.520
I felt a lot of pressure to get a higher education.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.520
My teachers told me that I needed to continue my studies

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.520
if I really wanted to make money.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.520
I wanted to be a teacher, but there was so much pressure

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.520
from my family to study something that would allow me to have a higher salary.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.520
There were times when I felt overwhelmed because of the pressure.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.519
Even after I graduated from high school,

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.519
a teacher contacted me to make sure that I was planning to go to university.

00:01:08.519 --> 00:01:13.519
And in his words, actually become someone in this world.

00:01:13.519 --> 00:01:18.519
I started a six-year psychology degree at university.

00:01:18.519 --> 00:01:23.519
And at the same time, I was studying for a teacher certificate on the weekends.

00:01:23.519 --> 00:01:27.519
And on top of all of that, I was working part-time.

00:01:27.519 --> 00:01:29.519
I was trying to do everything.

00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:37.480
What helped you make a good decision?

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.480
I spoke with my mom about what I should do.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.480
She helped me to think about some of the dangers I would be exposed to at university.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.480
Things that could endanger me in a spiritual sense.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.480
After about two years, it became clear that I couldn't continue with such a busy routine.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.480
I needed to make a change.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.480
I remembered some advice I got from a friend.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.480
He had studied to become an accountant when he was young,

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.480
but now he sells chilies.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.479
He jokingly said, so now I'm counting chilies.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.979
So I guess you could say that it is what I studied.

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:17.979
He explained that many people end up in jobs that have nothing to do with their university degree.

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:20.979
Philippians 110 helped me.

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:24.979
It says that we should make sure of the more important things.

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:27.979
I knew that finding a job was important,

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:31.979
but it was more important that I had time for Jehovah.

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:35.979
I've always loved Jehovah's promise at Matthew 633.

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:39.979
Where he says that he will make sure we have what we need

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:43.979
if we keep seeking for seeking to mend his righteousness.

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:47.979
I had already seen this promise come true in my life,

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:51.979
so I trusted that Jehovah would continue to provide for me.

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:54.979
I knew that if I studied at university,

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:57.979
I would be losing valuable time during my youth,

00:02:57.979 --> 00:03:01.979
time that I could be using for Jehovah.

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:04.979
Sometimes we have many different options in front of us,

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:07.979
or we know that we need to adjust our course.

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:11.979
That's when looking to Bible principles can help us to choose the right path.

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:15.740
My father has a barber shop,

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.740
and he offered to teach me how to be a barber.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.740
My parents told me,

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.740
people will always need a haircut.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.740
So even though I knew I wouldn't be making millions as a barber,

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.740
it was work that would always be in demand.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.740
I decided to leave university halfway through my degree

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.740
and look for part-time teaching work.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.740
During that time, I prayed so much,

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:45.500
asking Jehovah to bless my decision.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.500
What benefits have come from your decisions?

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.500
I'm my own boss.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.500
I work in a barber shop and also travel to people's homes

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.500
and give them haircuts.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.500
I have the freedom to decide the days and hours that I work.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.500
Jehovah answered my prayers.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.500
I was able to find part-time work teaching at a school,

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.500
which allows me to be in full-time service,

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.500
along with my husband.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.500
Because of the flexibility I have with my work,

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.500
I enjoy opportunities to participate in construction projects for the organization.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.500
I've seen clearly that by focusing on what's most important,

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.500
Jehovah has blessed me.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.500
I continue to see the fulfillment of Matthew 633 in my life.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.500
Jehovah has always provided what I needed.
