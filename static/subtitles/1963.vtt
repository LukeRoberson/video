00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:20.519
This is Birmingham, once the home of renowned scientist and minister Joseph Priestley.

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:26.519
In 1789, Priestley joined forces with a group of talented individuals

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.519
to start work on a new translation of the Bible into English.

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:39.520
For the past 200 years, this project was assumed to have failed and all work considered lost.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.520
How was this translation different? And why was it never published?

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.520
We spoke to several scholars to uncover the story of Priestley and his translation project.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.520
He's best known today for his work in science in electricity and gases,

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.520
particularly in uncovering the properties of oxygen.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.520
Well, Joseph Priestley was an extraordinary man.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.519
He's now these days remembered really as a scientist,

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.519
but that's not as he would have wanted to be remembered.

00:01:07.519 --> 00:01:12.519
He would have wanted to be remembered as a minister of religion, as a theologian,

00:01:12.519 --> 00:01:14.519
and that was his great passion.

00:01:14.519 --> 00:01:20.519
He is somebody who could pick up languages, who had a prodigious memory,

00:01:20.519 --> 00:01:23.519
an enormous capacity for hard work.

00:01:23.519 --> 00:01:28.519
He learnt Hebrew early on, probably around the age of 15,

00:01:28.519 --> 00:01:32.519
and then went on to learn, as well as Greek and Latin,

00:01:32.519 --> 00:01:36.519
he also learnt the major Semitic languages that were available in those days.

00:01:36.519 --> 00:01:42.519
That was an enormous help when it came to his reinvestigation of biblical texts,

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:52.519
because he could compare the King James's version of the Bible with original texts in original languages.

00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:57.519
There were multiple manuscripts, both of the Hebrew texts and of the Greek texts,

00:01:57.519 --> 00:02:04.519
which were now available and showed that sometimes the text that the authorised version was based on,

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:06.519
was not the only reading available.

00:02:06.519 --> 00:02:10.520
I think it's fairly clear where the language of the King James was wonderful.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.520
It does have mistranslations, it does have interpolations,

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.520
it does have errors of translation in it.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.520
Priestley was an independent thinker, searching for truth.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.520
There was one truth he considered most important,

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.520
that the scriptures describe Almighty God as being distinct from Jesus.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.520
In 1783, he published this pamphlet which reads,

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.520
the scriptures teach us that there is but one God,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.520
who is himself the maker and the governor of all things.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.520
That this one God is the sole object of worship,

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.520
and that he sent Jesus Christ to instruct mankind,

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.520
empowered him to work miracles, raised him from the dead,

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.520
and gave him all the power that he ever was or is now possessed of.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.520
Priestley felt that the authorised version blurred this distinction between God and Christ.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.520
So, in 1787, he reached out to his closest friend,

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.520
a minister named Theophilus Lindsay.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:26.520
Lindsay began as an Anglican clergyman, but he gradually began to question notions such as the Trinity.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:34.520
He was coming to an understanding of theology in the same direction that Priestley was.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.520
Priestley wrote to Lindsay,

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:42.520
I am glad that you seem pleased with the idea of a new translation of the Bible.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.520
It does not appear to me to be a very formidable undertaking,

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.520
and if you will do the New Testament, I will engage for the Old.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.520
In three years, it may be done very well.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.520
To finish the project in three years was an ambitious target.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:05.520
The King James Version had taken 47 scholars seven years to complete.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:13.520
So, Priestley and Lindsay joined with two fellow scholars to start planning the project.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.519
Their plan was to improve the King James Version

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:24.519
by changing only those passages that required a more accurate rendering.

00:04:24.519 --> 00:04:29.519
The group agreed to a set of rules to guide the translation work.

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:37.519
One of those rules would make this translation different from any other Bible that had ever been published in English,

00:04:37.519 --> 00:04:41.519
or possibly in any language up to that time.

00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:44.519
The rule was simple.

00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:51.519
To let God's name, as it appears in Hebrew, be rendered as Jehovah,

00:04:51.519 --> 00:04:55.519
rather than the word Lord in the Old Testament.

00:04:55.519 --> 00:04:59.519
And to use the name Jehovah in the New Testament,

00:04:59.519 --> 00:05:14.300
where it may be proper to distinguish God from Christ.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.300
This was not a new idea.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.300
Here we have a book by Hopton Haynes.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.300
Some 40 years prior to Priestley's translation project,

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.300
he proposed the very same approach.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.810
Haynes believed that in the King James Version,

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.810
the original word Jehovah should have remained untranslated

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.810
and that if the word Jehovah had been used in the New Testament,

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.810
where the word Lord is often used,

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:49.810
this might have secured a proper distinction between the Lord our God and our Lord or Master Christ.

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.810
Priestley's team agreed with that idea.

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:59.410
Recognizing that they were in need of more assistance,

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.410
they began reaching out to other scholars for help,

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.410
not many accepted.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.410
They had reason to be cautious.

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:13.410
Preparing a new Bible translation in 18th century England was more than ambitious.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:23.420
It was potentially dangerous.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:28.420
Producing any translation at this time was a very sensitive issue.

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.420
A number of people had begun translations,

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.420
but often never finished them.

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:39.420
The Church of England was built upon the King James Version.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.420
This was the version the church authorized.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.420
This was the version on which the church theology derived.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:50.420
So it was a theological opposition.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.420
If you were going to say the translation was not sufficient,

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:58.420
and if you bring in a new translation, you are saying we have a new theology,

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.420
which is contrary to the Church of England.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:11.160
Within three months of the initial planning meeting,

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.160
other like-minded scholars offered to help,

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.160
including a man whose talents would prove invaluable,

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.160
Robert Edward Garnam.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:26.160
We're now in Cambridge, where we asked Dr. Nicholas Bell and Dr. Chris Reed

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.160
to tell us more about Garnam and his work.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:38.839
Robert Garnam came to Trinity as a student at the age of 16 in 1769.

00:07:38.839 --> 00:07:41.839
He was then admitted as a scholar a year later,

00:07:41.839 --> 00:07:45.839
and in due course, himself became a fellow of the college.

00:07:45.839 --> 00:07:49.839
A lot of his work could have happened here in the Ren Library in Trinity College.

00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:54.839
The library by Garnam's time was probably still not completely full,

00:07:54.839 --> 00:07:58.839
but more than half would have been editions of the Bible

00:07:58.839 --> 00:08:01.839
and biblical commentaries of the theological texts.

00:08:01.839 --> 00:08:05.839
So to have all the tools you need for a very deep theological work,

00:08:05.839 --> 00:08:07.839
readily to hand in one building,

00:08:07.839 --> 00:08:09.839
would have been a significant advantage.

00:08:09.839 --> 00:08:15.839
Priestly and Lindsay valued his contributions to that extremely highly,

00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:18.839
because he was such an acute intellect,

00:08:18.839 --> 00:08:21.839
but combined with that, he was an incredibly hard worker.

00:08:21.839 --> 00:08:25.839
I think to see that this particular preacher

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:30.839
had studied the text of the Bible in quite such steps

00:08:30.839 --> 00:08:33.840
is really quite an important revelation.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:38.840
Garnam worked quietly, but he also worked quickly.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.840
He finished his original assignment,

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.840
translating the letters of the New Testament,

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.840
and then took on even more.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:51.840
In a letter to Lindsay dated November 25, 1789,

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.840
priestly observed,

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.840
Mr. Garnam is a valuable member of our core.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.840
Lindsay later acknowledged to another member of the team

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.840
that no one's labors are beyond those of Mr. Garnam.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.840
The improved Bible that priestly and his team had been hoping for

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.840
was finally inching toward completion.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:16.840
And then, the Birmingham riots of 1791

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.840
were among the most violent to erupt in 18th century Britain.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.840
In addition to their controversial political views,

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.840
priestly and other non-conformists had openly challenged

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.840
the beliefs of the church.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.840
To Anglican clergymen, that made them a threat and a target.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.840
Four days of violence left several writers dead

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.840
and destroyed many buildings, including priestly's home.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.840
His house at Fair Hill was completely burnt down.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.840
He was very lucky to escape.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.840
And his papers were thrown literally out of the window.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.840
All his manuscripts, his books,

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:58.840
and it does seem as if his translation did not survive.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:02.840
Priestly left England in 1794 for the United States.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:08.840
He was isolated geographically, isolated socially and culturally.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.840
He was in a really difficult position.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.840
Having lost his library, and without a team to support him,

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:19.840
priestly was unable to continue with his translation project.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.840
He never took it up again.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:26.840
But what about Garnam and his translation work?

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:31.840
The answer to that question lies in London.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:36.840
Garnam had cautiously only ever published his many writings anonymously.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:41.840
So after rioters destroyed priestly's home and the project was abandoned,

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:45.840
Garnam left his work unpublished.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.840
In the years that followed, Garnam's attitude toward the Bible changed,

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.840
and his faith diminished dramatically.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:58.840
He died in 1802 at the age of 49.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.840
But what about his translation work?

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.840
Did any of the manuscripts survive?

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:10.840
For more than 200 years, the answer seemed to be no.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:16.840
But early in 2017, research has made an unexpected discovery

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.840
at the Doctor Williams Library in central London.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.840
What exactly did they find?

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:30.539
Two sets of well-preserved manuscripts,

00:11:30.539 --> 00:11:35.539
which together comprised almost the entire New Testament.

00:11:35.539 --> 00:11:40.539
One a rough draft, and the other a more polished version.

00:11:40.539 --> 00:11:46.539
And one of them was clearly signed with the initials R-E-G.

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:50.919
Robert Edward Garnam.

00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:53.919
As researchers examined these newly discovered manuscripts,

00:11:53.919 --> 00:11:57.919
they realized they had found something extraordinary.

00:11:57.919 --> 00:12:03.919
The only surviving manuscript from priestly's project ever to have been found.

00:12:03.919 --> 00:12:07.919
I think it's very unusual to find a manuscript of this nature

00:12:07.919 --> 00:12:10.919
because not many of them survive anyway.

00:12:10.919 --> 00:12:13.919
And therefore, I think that's why it's remarkable.

00:12:13.919 --> 00:12:16.919
Garnam's translation was unique in a number of ways,

00:12:16.919 --> 00:12:22.919
with fresh modern renderings of many familiar verses.

00:12:22.919 --> 00:12:25.919
Where the King James version states that,

00:12:25.919 --> 00:12:28.919
the whole world lieth in wickedness.

00:12:28.919 --> 00:12:31.919
Garnam's version says,

00:12:31.919 --> 00:12:35.919
the whole world is in the power of the adversary,

00:12:35.919 --> 00:12:41.379
rather than use the word hell.

00:12:42.379 --> 00:12:47.379
Garnam translated the Greek word Hades as the grave.

00:12:47.379 --> 00:12:53.379
But perhaps most of the worthy is Garnam's use of the name Jehovah.

00:12:53.379 --> 00:12:58.720
Where the King James version says,

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:04.720
thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.720
Garnam wrote,

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:12.970
thou shalt love Jehovah thy God with all thy heart.

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:17.970
Where as other translations use God's name only a handful of times.

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:20.970
Garnam followed the team's translation rules

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:27.970
and used the name Jehovah some two hundred times throughout the New Testament.

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:32.970
We had always assumed this translation had been lost at that point.

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:37.970
So the finding of Garnam's New Testament translation amongst his papers,

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:41.970
amongst our collection was a revelation, a great surprise.

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:45.970
The manuscripts in the Doctor Williams library are terribly exciting.

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:51.970
This was a translation undertaken by real scholars who knew their Hebrew and Greek.

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:56.970
It's absolutely fascinating and it needs bringing to a wider audience.

00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:03.970
The work that Garnam left behind brings to light a thrilling chapter in the history of the Bible.

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:07.970
An 18th century English translation of the New Testament

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:12.970
that had it been published would have been truly groundbreaking.
