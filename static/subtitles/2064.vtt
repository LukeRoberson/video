00:00:05.679 --> 00:00:10.679
Once relegated to adult theatres, bookstores, or new stands,

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:18.379
today pornography is everywhere, only a click or tap away.

00:00:18.379 --> 00:00:35.439
It is not new, erotic art existed in ancient cultures.

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:39.439
For some, it was even a part of their worship.

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:57.659
Today, even some religious people feel that pornography is harmless

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:00.659
and therefore acceptable.

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:05.579
On the other hand, some who read the Bible

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:08.579
feel that pornography and erotic literature are harmful,

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:10.579
even a sin against God.

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:20.299
What is God's view of pornography?

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.780
Though the word pornography doesn't appear in the Bible,

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.780
the Bible's principles make very clear

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.640
how God feels about sexual matters.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.640
First Corinthians 6, 9 and 10,

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.640
leaves no doubt about God's view of sexual immorality,

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.560
sexual acts outside of marriage.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.159
Those who are sexually immoral will not inherit God's kingdom.

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.159
Jesus told us that fueling immoral desires is also sinful.

00:01:58.159 --> 00:01:59.159
He said,

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.159
everyone who keeps on looking at a woman

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.159
so as to have a passion for her

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.409
has already committed adultery with her in his heart.

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:12.409
But Colossians 3.5, we are told to deaden our body members

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:14.409
as respect sexual immorality,

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:22.919
uncleanness, uncontrolled sexual passion.

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:27.919
Pornography arouses immoral, unclean sexual desires.

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:30.919
The very opposite of what we are told to do,

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:32.919
deaden or suppress them.

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:38.969
The Bible warns what uncontrolled desire can lead to.

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:42.969
James 1, 14 and 15 says we are drawn out and enticed

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:44.969
by our own desire.

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:46.969
Then the desire, when it has become fertile,

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:48.969
gives birth to sin.

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:50.969
In turn, sin, when it has been carried out,

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:52.969
rings forth death.

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:56.789
If God condemns immoral acts,

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:58.789
clearly he would disapprove of

00:02:58.789 --> 00:03:01.789
as watching people engage in such acts.

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:06.060
Pornography, whether we watch it,

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.060
read it, or listen to it,

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.060
must be highly offensive to God.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.520
God wants husbands and wives to enjoy love

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.520
and intimacy in their marriage.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.520
But he hates all forms of sexual and cleanness,

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.520
including pornography.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.520
Like any bad habit, viewing pornography

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.520
can be overcome.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.090
And many, with God's help, have successfully done so.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.090
