WEBVTT

00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:07.570
In each of the parts of this symposium, the speaker will help us to see not only the

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:14.009
wonder of creation, but also the thunder of creation.

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.969
We will hear Jehovah's words like thunder loud and clear.

00:00:19.969 --> 00:00:23.969
Please find neomy 9.6 with me.

00:00:23.969 --> 00:00:34.850
And notice the faith-strengthening effect that creation has on the angels above, neomy 9.6.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.609
You alone are Jehovah.

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:45.289
You made the heavens, yes the heaven of the heavens and all their army, the earth and all that

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:49.929
is on it, the seas, and all that is in them.

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:55.369
You preserve all of them alive and the army of the heavens are bowing down to you.

00:00:55.369 --> 00:01:01.530
Well, that verse extolls Jehovah as the creator.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.250
But did you notice the expression, the heaven of the heavens?

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.849
What is that?

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:16.250
Well, that refers to the complete extent of the physical heavens, the atmospheric heavens,

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.090
the heavens of outer space, and at the top of the heavens outer space, that rim, that

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.180
is the heaven of the heavens, the highest heavens.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.620
Now when we look at the heavens, what do we see?

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.739
What do we feel?

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:40.420
Well, in that verse, did you notice it mentions first time the heavens and all their army.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:47.219
That's referring to the physical army of the heavens, the stars, the planets, the galaxies.

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:52.379
Did you notice in the last sentence, there's another army of the heavens.

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:57.019
And that refers to the holy angels of God.

00:01:57.019 --> 00:02:04.939
And just contemplating the physical creation, the angels are moved to bow down or worship

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:13.539
Jehovah, contemplating the creation can have a similar effect on us.

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:20.419
Now each talk of this symposium will discuss how meditating on an aspect of creation

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:25.819
will build our faith in Jehovah's promises.

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.620
Let's watch a video about the stars.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:42.430
And then we will have a faith strengthening application to our resurrection hope.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:57.259
Our sun is considered an average star, yet the energy from the sun that reaches the earth

00:02:57.259 --> 00:03:10.479
is thousands of times the world's total energy use.

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:21.810
With our unated eyes, we might see about 3,000 stars on a dark night.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:32.580
Many in a fuzzy band, the Milky Way galaxy, where our sun is just one of perhaps

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:40.539
200 to 400 billion stars.

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:49.819
Astronomers think the Milky Way galaxy is clustered together with around 100,000 large galaxies

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:54.740
in a massive structure called a supercluster.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:08.310
That together with an estimated 2 trillion galaxies make up the known physical universe.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:16.069
Countless stars spread over unfathomable distances, releasing immense amounts of energy

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:22.870
may be impossible to grasp for us, but not for Jehovah.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.509
He counts the number of the stars, he calls all of them by name.

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:38.949
Our Lord is great and is mighty in power.

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:46.470
In just a two minute video about the stars, we see the awesome wonder.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.790
But do we hear the thunder?

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:56.949
Do we hear the clear, undeniable application from Jehovah our Creator?

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:03.230
I invite you to turn with me to Isaiah 4026, please.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:11.470
What can we come to appreciate about Jehovah by pondering the magnitude and the magnificence

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:12.470
of the stars?

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:18.189
Well, in Isaiah 4026, Jehovah says, look at the stars.

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:23.509
He says, lift up your eyes to heaven and see.

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:25.709
Who has created these things?

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:27.670
The wonder.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.470
It is the one who brings out their army by number.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.110
He calls them all by name.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:42.829
Because of his vast dynamic energy and his awe-inspiring power, not one of them is missing.

00:05:42.829 --> 00:05:50.870
On the video we saw, it estimated that there are 2 trillion galaxies in outer space, each

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.990
with billions of stars.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.509
So do the math.

00:05:56.509 --> 00:06:03.639
How many names of inanimate objects does Jehovah have in his memory?

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:09.709
How many can he possibly contain?

00:06:09.709 --> 00:06:16.990
But did you notice at the end of that verse, it says that not one of them are missing?

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.670
It is said that there's a billion trillion stars.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:29.629
So I have to ask you, would Jehovah remember your name, your loved one's name?

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:31.430
Not one of them is missing.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.870
Not one star goes missing to Jehovah?

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:38.819
Well, how about our dead loved ones?

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:42.019
Did they go missing?

00:06:42.019 --> 00:06:48.899
My favorite verse is when a faithful servant of Jehovah dies, our Romans 14, 7 through 9.

00:06:48.899 --> 00:06:59.339
In verse 8, it says, if we live or if we die, we belong to Jehovah.

00:06:59.339 --> 00:07:02.779
The status with Jehovah does not change at death.

00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:07.139
That person did not go missing.

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:12.579
But what about those of us who have loved ones that at the time of their death, they had

00:07:12.579 --> 00:07:17.579
not come to learn about or put faith in Jehovah?

00:07:17.579 --> 00:07:18.579
What about that?

00:07:18.579 --> 00:07:20.379
Well, think about this.

00:07:20.379 --> 00:07:27.420
If Jehovah had the ability, the power to create those huge stars and galaxies, he can

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:34.139
recreate all, all those sleeping in the memorial tombs.

00:07:34.139 --> 00:07:36.139
Find John 5, 28, and 29.

00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:42.899
Let's verify that so that all of us, whether the dead loved one was previously a faithful

00:07:42.899 --> 00:07:48.899
witness or not, all of us can entertain the hope of the resurrection.

00:07:48.899 --> 00:07:55.709
John 5, 28, and 29 did not be amazed at this.

00:07:55.709 --> 00:08:01.790
For the hour is coming in which all, all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:04.149
and come out.

00:08:04.149 --> 00:08:10.910
Those who did good things to a resurrection of life and those who practiced, you see even

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:15.350
vile things to a resurrection of judgment.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:21.629
Yes, they'll be restored to life and they'll have the opportunity to come to love the

00:08:21.629 --> 00:08:26.870
one who gifted them with a miracle of a resurrection.

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:34.149
Now, in our video, right at the end, on screen, there was a quotation of Psalm 147, 4 and

00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:35.149
5.

00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:40.549
In verse 4, it says that Jehovah counts all the stars, the billion trillions or more of

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:41.549
them.

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:46.870
It says he named each one the billion or trillion of them.

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:49.950
That is amazing indeed.

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:53.190
I would like to learn another lesson from the book of Job.

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:59.600
Joe 14, please, we're going to reverse 13 and 15.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:05.279
When a star burns out, it does not go missing to Jehovah.

00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:12.279
No doubt he remembers its name, but he is not motivated to resurrect that star back to

00:09:12.279 --> 00:09:18.919
light so that it can again twinkle in a dark night sky.

00:09:18.919 --> 00:09:21.399
But what about humans?

00:09:21.399 --> 00:09:30.320
We were created in the image of Jehovah God and his son, Christ Jesus, Joe 14, 13.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:37.960
Job says, Oh, that in the grave, you would conceal me, that you would hide me until your

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:45.279
anger passes by, that you would set a time limit for me and remember me.

00:09:45.279 --> 00:09:49.360
In verse 14, it's obviously talking about the resurrection.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.279
What would Job in effect just become a burned out star?

00:09:53.279 --> 00:09:55.639
No.

00:09:55.639 --> 00:10:03.039
Unlike a burned out star, Jehovah yearns he longs to call back each human to life so that

00:10:03.039 --> 00:10:08.159
we can again see that star like twinkle in their eyes.

00:10:08.159 --> 00:10:15.509
And now verse 15, you, that's Jehovah, we'll call and I will answer you.

00:10:15.509 --> 00:10:19.509
You see from the grave, I will answer you.

00:10:19.509 --> 00:10:28.309
You will long for the work of your hands, but Jehovah has the memory to bring back people.

00:10:28.309 --> 00:10:37.509
He has the power to bring back people and he has the longing to bring back people to life.

00:10:37.509 --> 00:10:48.779
Friends, observe the stars, have faith that you will see your resurrected loved ones.

00:10:48.779 --> 00:10:53.419
And now brother Pat LaFranca, a helper to the personnel committee will continue this

00:10:53.419 --> 00:11:00.379
symposium with his talk, use creation to build your faith, oceans.
