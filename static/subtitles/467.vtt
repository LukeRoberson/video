00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:09.689
Now in our entirety, Proverbs 21-5 says the plans of the diligent, surely lead to success,

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:14.210
but all who are hasty, surely head for poverty.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.129
That is not a Bible law.

00:00:17.129 --> 00:00:19.210
It's a Bible principle.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:25.210
And before we discuss how Proverbs 21-5 might be applied, let's be reminded again of

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.210
the difference between a law and a principle.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.809
We've had articles on it, we've had it discussed their circuit assembly.

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:34.090
But still, there are some of our congregations that would have a hard time making the

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.210
distinction between the two.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.450
A principle, just one principle, can be broadly applied to many different situations and

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.530
decisions in life.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:51.490
Whereas a Bible law, it addresses just one very precise, very specific action.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.450
You can turn to 1 Corinthians 6, verse 9, and 10.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.170
Many some areas of life Jehovah has explicit commands or laws.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.849
And here in 1 Corinthians 6, 9, and 10, it reflects some of those laws of God.

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:14.849
Or do you not know that unrighteous people will not inherit God's kingdom do not be misled?

00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:21.650
Those who are sexually immoral, idolaters, adulterers, men who submit to homosexual acts,

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:29.329
and who practice homosexuality, thieves, greedy people, drunkards, revilers, and extortioners

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.209
will not inherit God's kingdom.

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:35.049
These represent some laws of God.

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:37.129
Do not commit adultery, that's a law.

00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:39.409
Do not steal, do not become a drunkard.

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:40.689
Those are laws.

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:43.930
Very clear, there's no interpretation necessary.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.930
It's a yes or no do or don't situation.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:48.930
But what about principles?

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.569
How do they differ from laws?

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:57.010
Well, a principle is a basic truth in God's word that can help us to make good decisions.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:03.450
Now as Christians, we all face situations in life for which there's no regulation in the Bible.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.689
We have to reason things out and make a decision.

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:12.889
Just illustrates, suppose you're driving the countryside and there's a herd of deer

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:14.969
running towards the road.

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:16.689
But what will you do?

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:22.849
Well, there's no law that says you should speed up and get there before they do.

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:27.490
There's no law that says no, just continue at 55 miles an hour and see what happens.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.289
But what would you likely do?

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:32.610
Well, you would slow down the car.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.889
And how could you make that decision without a law?

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:42.449
You reasoned on the principle and the principle is safety and you made a good decision.

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:45.250
Or there's a sign, 55 miles an hour.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.610
Now that is a law.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.689
You're not to go over 55 and that section of the roadway.

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:53.129
But what if it was a blinding rainstorm?

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:57.330
Would you insist on going 55 miles an hour because it's allowed?

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:05.050
No, again, using the very same principle of safety, you would slow down and make a good decision.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:14.330
So there was two situations, no law, but by applying the same principle, you made a good decision.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.610
But do we have some examples of principles that could be applied as we make decisions on life's roadway?

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.250
How about Romans 153?

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.849
The Christ did not please himself.

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:32.889
Can you imagine how many situations in life that would instantly answer our question as to what we should do?

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:37.930
Or James before, friendship with the world is enmity with God.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:44.090
That could be applied to associations, to movies, to music, to clothing styles, and so much more.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:52.370
So when some issue or decision is about to jump out in front of us, we need to slow down and search for a principle.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.689
Please find Ephesians chapter 5.

00:03:55.689 --> 00:04:00.330
It has a phrase that coincides with searching for a principle.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.050
What were you verse 15, first of all?

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.889
It says, so keep strict watch that how you walk is not as unwise, but as wise persons.

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:11.250
Well, that could be simply obeying a Bible law.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.810
Do not commit adultery, do not steal.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.170
Keeps strict watch that you act wisely.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.449
But now notice verse 17, it's worded differently.

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:23.810
It says, on this account, stop being unreasonable.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.889
So it's alluding to the fact that we should reason on a matter.

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:32.129
And here's what it says, but keep perceiving what the will of Jehovah is.

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:37.649
So in this case, there's no law spelling out exactly what we do, but we have to perceive.

00:04:37.649 --> 00:04:44.810
That means we search for and apply a Bible principle and we're perceiving what God's will is.

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:55.970
Now, not trying to complicate matters, but sometimes a specific law of God is underpinned by a basic truth or principle.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:05.850
For example, Deuteronomy 22, 8, it was a law that Israelites had to build a parapet wall around the flat roof of their home.

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.490
Prevent people from following being injured or possibly killed.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.850
That was a law.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.290
But what was the underlying principle?

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.649
It was respect for human life.

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:19.089
And that principle can be applied to so many circumstances in life now.

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:20.209
Respect for human life.

00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:24.810
For example, there's nothing in the Bible that talks about tobacco products.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:33.410
But a person coming into truth makes a good decision by applying the principle respect for life, his own life and the health of others.

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.769
So our text proverbs 21, 5, it's a principle.

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:40.769
It means it can be applied to so many different situations in our life.

00:05:40.769 --> 00:05:48.649
And again, it says the plans of the diligent surely lead to success, but all who are hasty, surely head for property.

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:54.529
So what are some situations that our publications have applied that principle to?

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:56.689
But one is commenting on meetings.

00:05:56.689 --> 00:06:00.129
We have to plan ahead to have success.

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:03.610
Or maybe we're in some form of full-time service.

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.610
And our parents become seriously ill.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.730
Well, proverbs 21, 5 said, do not be hasty.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:16.009
So we should not hastily conclude that we have to give up our privilege of service.

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:22.089
Possibly by planning, we could surely have success.

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:25.850
Living within one's means financially, proverbs 21, 5.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.129
And this case, the plan has a name. It's called a budget.

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:34.810
But then we have people making decisions on who will they marry, do not be hasty.

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.889
Or maybe a couple deciding whether to have children or not.

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:39.769
Don't make a hasty decision.

00:06:39.769 --> 00:06:46.050
Look beyond that cute little, cooing baby face and consider the pros and cons.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:51.290
Well, our brother's approaching retirement age, proverbs 21, 5, will help him make a good decision.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:58.329
So that's just a sampling of the variety of situations that this one verse can help us to make good decisions.

00:06:58.329 --> 00:07:03.689
We're so thankful to Jehovah that he has provides specific laws that we must obey.

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:07.889
But he's also given us a host of principles that can help us make good decisions.

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:13.930
And by implementing both of those in our life, we can maintain a clean conscience before our God.
