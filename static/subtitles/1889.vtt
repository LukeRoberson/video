00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:07.700
For this update, we're going to focus on our all-important disciple-making work.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:17.539
Despite the pandemic, the governing body continues to look for ways to make our ministry even more effective.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:26.100
How? By continuing to build on the direction provided at the 2017 annual meeting.

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:36.420
At that meeting, the governing body announced organizational adjustments based on 1st Corinthians 926.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:47.140
That verse says, therefore, the way I am running is not aimlessly, the way I am aiming my blows is so as

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.500
not to be striking the ear. How do we make our blows count?

00:00:52.979 --> 00:01:03.380
We focus on what Acts 1348 mentions, searching for those who are rightly disposed for everlasting life.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.379
How have we been helped to do that? Consider a few examples from the past year.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.819
We reviewed Watchtower study articles that focused on helping new ones progress to baptism,

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.180
and that reminded us to discontinue unproductive studies.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:32.739
The 2020 regional convention program devoted an entire day to the disciple-making work

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.219
and to helping Bible students progress to baptism.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.060
Who could forget Nita and Jade?

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:49.060
Our November campaign included a special effort to provide government officials with information

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:56.099
about God's kingdom with the goal of reaching even more rightly disposed ones.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.659
And aren't we excited to use the new Bible study tool and joy life forever,

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:10.819
which features a more effective teaching style? But 2020 saw another significant effort

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:20.979
to make our blows count in June 2020. It was announced that all branches would evaluate their

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:27.780
foreign language and indigenous language, pregroups, groups, and congregations.

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:36.819
What was the reason for this evaluation? Notice what the governing body conveyed to the elders

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:45.819
at that time. In recent years, Jehovah's people have responded to the call to expand their

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:52.860
ministry by learning another language in order to reach honest-hearted ones and publishers

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:59.979
should be commended for their self-sacrificing efforts in this regard. Nevertheless,

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:08.539
it has been noted that in some cases, pregroups or groups show little evidence of growth,

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:15.819
with few progressive Bible studies and few, if any, progressing to baptism.

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:22.620
In harmony with 1 Corinthians 9.26, the governing body wants to be certain

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:34.139
that we are making our blows count. How were these language groups and congregations evaluated?

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:42.300
Notice what happened in the first century when Paul and his companions wanted to expand

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:51.259
their ministry. Acts 16, 6-10 explains that they traveled many miles and made concerted

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:59.900
efforts to preach in various territories. However, Jehovah, through his Holy Spirit,

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:08.620
directed them to the right area. Let's read this at Acts 16, 9. And during the night,

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:15.020
a vision appeared to Paul. A Macedonian man was standing there urging him and saying,

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:22.300
step over into Macedonia and help us. How did they respond? Verse 10 says,

00:04:23.019 --> 00:04:29.899
as soon as he had seen the vision, we tried to go into Macedonia, drawing in the conclusion that

00:04:29.899 --> 00:04:37.740
God had summoned us to declare the good news to them. When they discerned Jehovah's direction,

00:04:38.459 --> 00:04:46.379
the brothers immediately followed the leading of the Holy Spirit. Likewise,

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:55.019
we followed the Spirit's lead. Of course, it's not provided through visions, but through evidence

00:04:55.819 --> 00:05:03.500
in the field. The recent evaluation showed that some foreign language and indigenous language

00:05:03.579 --> 00:05:12.699
groups and congregations had existed for years and yet had few or no publishers who were dependent

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:21.740
on the language. In other cases, the territory was very scattered, so publishers and pioneers

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:30.459
had to travel long distances to find someone who could speak the language. Despite all of this

00:05:30.459 --> 00:05:38.699
effort, there were a few Bible studies and few interested ones if any who attended meetings.

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:49.100
What was Jehovah's Spirit telling us? It would be better to use our efforts in other fields.

00:05:50.699 --> 00:06:00.850
Thus, such pregroups and congregations were dissolved. Have you been personally impacted

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:12.449
by this evaluation? If so, you're not alone. For example, as a result of the evaluation in just

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:24.689
16 branch territories, some $4,700, 2,800 ministerial servants and 11,000 regular pioneers have

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:34.139
been made available to serve in other fields. At one time, we may have thought that the

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:39.740
largest increase was taking place in foreign language or indigenous language fields,

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:46.300
but as we've considered the matter more carefully, it seems that congregations in the

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:55.019
main languages of many countries are experiencing the largest numbers of newly baptized disciples.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:03.259
So, if you're now returning to a congregation in one of the main languages of your country,

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:11.740
remember that you are needed there. Many congregations are struggling to cover their

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:20.860
large territories. In major cities, there may be millions of people to reach, but few publishers

00:07:21.019 --> 00:07:30.220
and pioneers available to preach. Many pioneers and publishers are finding progressive return

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:37.259
visits and Bible studies in these fields. And think of how the congregations are being strengthened

00:07:37.899 --> 00:07:45.740
as so many mature ones joined them. More appointed brothers are now available to help with

00:07:45.899 --> 00:07:51.980
shepherding, to deliver meeting parts, and to assist in many other ways.

00:07:53.819 --> 00:07:58.220
What practical blessings are resulting from this evaluation?

00:07:59.339 --> 00:08:02.220
Let's hear the thoughts of a few branch committee members.

00:08:05.699 --> 00:08:10.740
Thanks to the wise direction of the governing body, the way we accomplish our ministry has

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:17.540
improved. More publishers, qualified pioneers and appointed brothers will be able to help rapidly

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:22.500
other congregations and concentrate their efforts in the most productive language fields

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:30.019
or fields with a greater potential. This evaluation has allowed us to assign

00:08:30.019 --> 00:08:35.220
graduates from the School for Kingdom Evangelizers and special pioneers as well

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:42.419
to more productive territories. But what we're hearing is that this is energized the

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:48.659
ministry of these pioneers. In fact, many of them are conducting progressive Bible studies now.

00:08:49.379 --> 00:08:55.139
None of us find adjustments easy, so it's been so encouraging to see how many have been

00:08:55.139 --> 00:09:01.940
willing to adapt to these changes in fact embracing them. In one language field, some brothers

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:08.340
were a little hesitant at first, but they were loyal, so of course they went along with the changes.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:14.659
Now the circuit overseer tells us that these ones have sent so many expressions of appreciation

00:09:14.659 --> 00:09:20.980
thanking them for these loving adjustments. Many learners have informed us that it has

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:26.580
greatly reduced their stress level. This has allowed them now to be in a congregation that

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:32.500
they can concentrate more on a productive ministry and take care of their own spirituality as well.

00:09:33.299 --> 00:09:38.100
There's one brother who is learning another language, and he was in a congregation and this

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:44.980
change from being a congregation to a group, and he said it's as if finally someone has just released

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:51.860
the pressure valve. If you read up truly, our branch committee saw Jehovah's spirit act and

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:58.659
is convinced he blessed this evaluation. What about our pioneers and publishers?

00:09:59.059 --> 00:10:04.740
Let's hear from some who have experienced these adjustments first hand.

00:10:06.669 --> 00:10:12.750
In the congregation where I'm serving now in Portuguese, the territory is very productive.

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:18.029
People are so receptive. I had the goal of starting one Bible study when I was in the foreign

00:10:18.029 --> 00:10:22.909
language group. When the adjustment came, in just a few weeks, I had five studies.

00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:28.350
We would drive around for hours looking for just a few specific individuals. Now we just

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:33.309
preach to people, and if we find foreign language speakers, we can still preach to them too.

00:10:33.309 --> 00:10:38.029
I have more joy in my ministry because I feel like I'm making good use of my time.

00:10:38.029 --> 00:10:43.789
Well we love being in foreign language, but realistically it takes a lot of time, so we've really

00:10:43.789 --> 00:10:49.950
enjoyed having more time to prepare for our meeting parts, discuss the points in our application.

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:55.070
It's been a really nice blessing. I personally have really benefited from having the extra time

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:58.110
just to spend on cultivating my relationship with Jehovah.

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:04.830
I really, really interesting is what one brother said from another group. He said,

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:10.590
okay, now I think I understand better the way that Jehovah does math. So instead of having 15

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:16.990
people learn a language to help one person, now just one person needs to learn a language to be

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:21.149
able to benefit from entire congregation. A hundred brothers or more.

00:11:21.549 --> 00:11:28.509
The first concern that I think we all had was for those who depended on the language

00:11:28.509 --> 00:11:32.909
that as it's turned out and as they've become part of the congregation,

00:11:32.909 --> 00:11:36.909
how they have any bigger family and brothers and sisters to care about them.

00:11:36.909 --> 00:11:41.309
So in our small congregation, the attendance to the memorial was usually just the publishers.

00:11:41.309 --> 00:11:47.070
Now being in this new congregation is very exciting because this year we had almost double the

00:11:47.149 --> 00:11:51.789
amount of the publishers in our congregation for the attendance this year. So that's very encouraging

00:11:51.789 --> 00:11:57.950
to see. We feel that now we are putting our time and energy in a territory that is actually

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:04.190
productive. And like for so Corinthians chapter 9 verse 26 says, we feel like we are making our

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:14.110
blows count. If you're in the same situation as these publishers, what will you do now?

00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:23.070
Like Paul, we need to be willing to redirect our efforts based on the leadings of God's spirit.

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:32.190
Learning another language may be one way that we can expand our ministry, but it's not the only way.

00:12:34.269 --> 00:12:40.669
Where is the greatest need for preachers? Where is their evidence of growth?

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:44.909
It might be in the field of your primary language.

00:12:44.909 --> 00:12:51.549
For practical advice on where your efforts and abilities are most needed,

00:12:51.549 --> 00:12:57.309
speak to your circuit over here or write to your local branch office.

00:12:57.309 --> 00:13:07.710
Jehovah's organization is on the move and it will not be stopped by the pandemic or anything else.

00:13:10.139 --> 00:13:15.899
Will this recent adjustment in priorities lead to even greater increases?

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:23.500
Perhaps it's too soon to say, but we're receiving positive reports.

00:13:24.779 --> 00:13:31.419
One branch reported that they've had 10 consecutive peaks in the number of publishers

00:13:31.419 --> 00:13:37.899
and another branch said that the number of new regular pioneers and new Bible studies

00:13:37.899 --> 00:13:46.429
is growing at a pace never seen before. The governing body has every confidence

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:54.110
that Jehovah will strengthen each of you so that we can truly make our blows count.

00:13:55.629 --> 00:14:04.350
We love all of you very much. From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:14.350
this is J. W. Broadcasting.
