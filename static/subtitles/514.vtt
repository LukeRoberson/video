00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:15.070
The Mediterranean region is well known for its beautiful olive groves, and delicious olive oil.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:21.870
Some of the oldest olive trees are found in Greece and in the Middle East.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:29.730
It's thought that some of the trees are thousands of years old, and yet they continue to bear

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:48.450
fruit, and they endure. They endure epidemic disease, they endure drought, they endure abuse,

00:00:49.009 --> 00:01:01.729
and even neglect, and they bear fruit. But there's one thing that is required for an olive tree to produce

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:15.170
fruit, water. In years of drought, olive trees don't produce fruit. So what do we learn from the olive

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.329
tree, and how does that relate to today's text? Turn with me, please, to Luke chapter 8.

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:33.750
And let's read verse 15 in its entirety. Here Jesus concludes his discussion of the man who

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:45.329
sowed seed that fell on different types of soho. As for that on the fine soho, these are the ones

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:52.450
who, after hearing the word with the fine and good heart, number one, retainhood. They retain

00:01:52.450 --> 00:02:02.049
the word, and number two, they bear fruit with endurance. Now we're glad Luke included that

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:11.090
detail that neither Mark nor Matthew included in their accounts. Bearing fruit as faithful disciples

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:20.689
of Christ would require endurance. And what is the key to endurance? Well the answer is in the verse,

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:33.650
do you see it? By retaining the word, we bear fruit with endurance. So like the olive tree,

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:40.050
you and I want to be fruitful. Like the olive tree, you and I will experience hardships,

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:49.090
challenges, disappointments, discouragement at times. And how is it that we bear fruit with endurance

00:02:49.090 --> 00:03:00.370
by having a heart attachment to Jehovah's word? We need to read it every day and meditate on it,

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:09.889
digest it spiritually. Why? Because the hope that we share with others is the same

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:18.129
hope that sustains us and strengthens our determination to continue faithful in the work

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:24.689
Jehovah has given us to do. The watchtower from which today's text is drawn,

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:34.370
discussed one challenge, unresponsive territory. And certainly that can be a challenge. I couldn't

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:43.090
help but think of Brother George Lindel. Brother Lindel lived in Canada when he learned the truth

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:54.370
and shortly after his baptism he began to pioneer and brother Lindel had a skill. He could speak

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:06.210
Icelandic. So he decided to move to Iceland. He did that in 1929 at the age of 40. Now little

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:15.889
did he know how much endurance would be required to stick to his assignment. For 18 years he was the

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:24.610
only witness in Iceland and during those years not one person to whom he preached took a stand

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:32.850
for the truth. Now in 1936 after he had been there for seven years he commented that he had placed

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:43.170
tens of thousands of books and yet not one person. He said some have taken a stand against the truth

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:50.689
but the majority continue to be indifferent. Would such an assignment call for endurance?

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:58.850
Absolutely. And Brother Lindel did endure faithfully in that assignment.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:07.410
Now there are other challenges that can make bearing witness difficult. For example we have

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:16.050
brothers and sisters in the world who are facing persecution, restrictions on the work and in

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:25.410
some places the work is banned and yet they continue to bear fruit with endurance. I thought of

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:34.129
Brother Harold King who along with his missionary partner Stanley Jones served in China during the 1950s

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:43.810
and early 1960s. In 1958 Brother King was sentenced to five years of solitary confinement.

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:54.050
Now that would be it seems a recipe for a long period of loneliness and possible discouragement.

00:05:55.009 --> 00:06:00.769
But how did Brother King address it? How did he approach it and what sustained him?

00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:11.490
Well it was the reservoir that he had built up of Bible knowledge and just like his partner

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:19.569
Brother Jones, Brother King remembered as many Bible verses as he could and he drew on that reservoir

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:25.649
to sustain him spiritually during his years of imprisonment. We might think of the brother

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:32.209
featured in the Sunday morning symposium on our regional convention program who was able to write

00:06:32.209 --> 00:06:41.569
down 500 Bible verses. How many could we write if we found ourselves in that situation?

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:49.569
It emphasizes the importance of building up a reservoir. The watchtower asked this interesting

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:58.129
question. If the two brothers King and Jones had failed to make a serious and diligent study of the

00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:07.329
Bible before they're arrest, what would have sustained them spiritually? Well it's a good reminder

00:07:07.329 --> 00:07:17.970
for us. The verses that Brother King recalled also helped him to bear fruit in a way. In solitary

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:24.209
confinement, he still went out in the ministry in the mornings talking to imaginary people.

00:07:25.009 --> 00:07:31.009
Eventually he met Mrs. Carter who after a series of return visits agreed to a Bible study.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:40.850
Now in the course of his ministry, Brother King says he spoke out loud. Why? So that he could hear

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:46.529
with his ears the hope that he was sharing with his imaginary audience.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:57.089
That Jehovah's word sustained him. So we retained the word and we bear fruit with endurance.

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:08.040
There's one other thing that we are enduring, a pandemic. And would you agree that it calls for

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:15.319
endurance in ways that we haven't experienced before? For example, in our ministry, we've been

00:08:15.319 --> 00:08:21.560
forced to consider avenues of witnessing that we might not have been attracted to before.

00:08:23.779 --> 00:08:28.660
Circuit overseers wife shared some interesting comments in that connection. She said,

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:34.500
we're having some of the best experiences through telephone witnessing. I have to say it was

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:42.100
somewhat intimidating when we started. But it is so obvious how Jehovah is blessing this work.

00:08:43.379 --> 00:08:49.299
In the congregations, Bible studies have almost doubled and we have more return visits than we

00:08:49.299 --> 00:08:56.259
can handle. It is so wonderful. Well, it is wonderful because Jehovah is blessing the work

00:08:56.259 --> 00:09:06.879
and he is enabling us to keep bearing fruit with endurance. In his letter, James said that we

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:14.639
should consider it all july when we meet with various trials, knowing as we do that the tested

00:09:14.639 --> 00:09:23.919
quality of our faith works out endurance. But James continues, allow endurance to complete its work

00:09:23.919 --> 00:09:31.440
why so that you and I will be complete and sound in all respects, not lacking in anything.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:38.080
That's our determination, isn't it? We would never seek to escape a trial by some unscriptural

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:45.919
means. No, we're determined to retain God's word and to bear fruit. As one of our kingdom songs

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:53.840
so well states, we will not give up nor see the need for doubt or fear. Faithfully will serve

00:09:53.919 --> 00:10:03.440
until Jehovah's Day is here. Let's keep on enduring. That time is very near. Yes, you and I are

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:20.720
determined to be amongst those who will retain God's word and bear fruit with endurance.
