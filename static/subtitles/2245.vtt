00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.330
Do you smoke?

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.330
Are you tempted to?

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.670
Maybe to fit in.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.670
Deal with stress.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.670
Or maybe you're just curious.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.670
Whatever the reason, you should know what smoking can do to you.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.670
At Romans 121, the Bible tells you to use your power of reason.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.670
So instead of just following the crowd, be smart enough and think for yourself.

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:46.299
Tobacco companies spend billions of dollars trying to convince people to smoke

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:51.299
and many people fall for it without thinking of the consequences.

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:56.299
For example, smoking can ruin your health.

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:59.299
And even the way you look.

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:04.299
The Bible says to cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit.

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:07.299
But smoking does the opposite.

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:17.000
Smokers are more likely to die from cancer, heart attacks, and other diseases.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And you know, it doesn't just affect you.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Second-hand smoke hurts those around you.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
But what about vaping?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Is it safer?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Not on your life.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
After being promoted as a safe alternative to smoking,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
vaping was implicated in dozens of deaths and thousands of users got very sick.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And just like smoking, you could get addicted.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Who really benefits if you take up vaping?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.379
So what will you do if someone invites you to smoke?

00:01:56.379 --> 00:01:59.379
Try simply saying, no thanks, I don't smoke.

00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:06.379
If that doesn't work, try something like, I checked out the risks and it's not for me.

00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:11.009
But what if you're already addicted?

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.009
It might feel like there's no way out.

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:19.060
But you can break the habit.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.060
First, if you vape or smoke, ask for help.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.060
If possible from someone who is successfully quit smoking.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.500
Second, avoid people in places that feed the urge.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.500
And one more thing, pray.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.500
If you pray intensely for help before you give in,

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.500
you can quit with God's help.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.500
A Bible writer said at Psalm 1829,

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.500
by God's power, I can scale a wall.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.500
Yes, even if you struggle with addiction,

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.500
you can win the fight.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.500
Resist the temptation to use tobacco in any form.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.939
You'll be healthier, happier, and breathe easier,

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:10.939
knowing your life isn't going up in smoke.
