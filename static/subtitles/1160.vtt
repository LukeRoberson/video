00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.480
around the world, people everywhere are looking for a savior.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.480
They long for a savior who can rescue them from disease,

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:18.480
from hunger, from poverty, from crime, from war, even from death.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.480
Well, in the midst of so many calamities and so many problems,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.480
why are Jehovah's people rejoicing?

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.479
Because our magnificent, our almighty God, Jehovah, is that savior.

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:39.479
We have him. And as a result, we feel joy in our hearts.

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:43.479
The scriptures describe Jehovah as being a grand savior.

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:48.479
We know it is a part of his personality, his identity,

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:53.479
to want to rescue and save his faithful servants.

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:59.479
Well, knowing that Jehovah wants to save us, how should it make us feel?

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:02.479
Let's open our Bibles and look at this thought.

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:10.480
In the book of Psalms, Psalm 9 and verse 14,

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.480
it says, so that I may declare your praiseworthy deeds

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:22.480
in the gates of the daughter of Zion and rejoice in your act of salvation.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.480
So now, how should we feel about Jehovah's ability to save us,

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.480
about his acts of salvation?

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.480
Well, the Psalmist said we want to rejoice in Jehovah's ability to save

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.480
and really brothers, when we have a faith, a confidence,

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.480
that Jehovah wants to save us, that he has the ability to save us,

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.480
and that he has ways and means to save us,

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.480
this truly is a reason for us to rejoice.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.480
If we have that faith, if we have that confidence,

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.480
we are going to be able to face the future with real confidence,

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:11.479
knowing that whatever trial may come our way, we have our Savior.

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:17.479
But now, brothers, to reassure us, to strengthen our confidence,

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:21.479
that Jehovah really is our Savior, it helps us to look to the past,

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:26.479
to Bible times, to see how Jehovah rescued and saved his people

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:32.479
both as a nation, but also as individuals.

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:37.479
Now, let's look rapidly at three different examples from the Scriptures,

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:41.479
where Jehovah saved his people as a nation.

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:44.479
Now, here's the first one. It's from Exodus chapter 14.

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:48.479
Now, you'll remember here that the nation of Israel was right there

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:51.479
at the Red Sea with Pharaoh's armies all around.

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:55.479
Well, it looked hopeless, but what did Jehovah do?

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:59.479
He opened up that Red Sea right in front of his people

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:04.479
and allowed them to walk through on dry land.

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:07.479
What a salvation that was.

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:11.479
And then, what about in the time of Jehoshaphat and the nation of Judah?

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:15.479
Do you remember when all those armies of the opposing nations

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:17.479
came and surrounded them again?

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:22.479
Well, now, Jehoshaphat in 2 Chronicles 20, he looked to Jehovah

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:25.479
and he said, Jehovah, we just, we don't know what to do.

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:29.479
But our eyes are toward you.

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:34.479
Well, what did Jehovah do? He said, take your position, stand still,

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:38.479
and see the salvation of Jehovah.

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:41.479
Well, that's what they did. They went out, they took their position,

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:44.479
and without them having to fight it all,

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:47.479
Jehovah threw those other armies into confusion,

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:52.479
and they all wiped each other out, without the nation of Judah having to do a thing.

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:54.479
Jehovah saved his people.

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:58.479
And as a third example, what about Hezekiah?

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:02.479
Now, we've had this amazing Bible drama several years ago

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:06.479
at our regional convention where we saw Hezekiah look to Jehovah

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:09.479
for his salvation and what happened?

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:15.479
Well, Jehovah sent one angel, wiped out 185,000 men in one night.

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:18.480
Well, now, what's the point, brothers?

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.480
It's obvious from our review of the Scriptures that Jehovah

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.480
is a savior of his people as a group, as a nation.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.480
We've seen it over and over again in the Scriptures.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.480
But what about as individuals?

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:40.480
Well, now, here's a nice example of what the Bible says here in Psalm 34.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.480
Let's read it first before we look at the example.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:49.069
It's Psalm 34 and verse 18.

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:52.069
Psalm 34, verse 18.

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:57.069
It says, Jehovah is close to the brokenhearted.

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:01.069
He saves those who are crushed in spirit.

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:03.069
Many are the hardships of the righteous one,

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:06.069
but what does it say here? Notice, brothers?

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:11.069
But Jehovah rescues him from them all.

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:16.069
So what's the point? See, Jehovah rescues the righteous one,

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:21.069
not just the righteous nation, but the righteous one.

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:23.069
Now, here's our example.

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:26.069
Think about the faithful woman Hannah.

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:28.069
Now, you remember her situation.

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:30.069
Hannah was barren.

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:34.069
She was constantly being harassed and tormented

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:38.069
by her husband's other wife, Penina.

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:42.069
And so she went to the temple and she poured out her heart to Jehovah.

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:46.069
Will you look at this with me? Let's go to first Samuel, chapter 1.

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:50.579
First Samuel, chapter 1.

00:05:50.579 --> 00:05:58.829
And you see here, you see here that in verse 10,

00:05:58.829 --> 00:06:04.240
it says that Hannah was extremely bitter.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.240
And she began to pray to Jehovah and to weep uncontrollably.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.240
Well, this faithful servant of God just poured out her heart,

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.240
begged Jehovah for his help, but she had a very specific request.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.240
You see, verse 11, she asked Jehovah for a child, a male child.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.240
And she told Jehovah, if she would get this child,

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.240
she would dedicate him to the service of God.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:33.240
Well, what happened? You see, look down here at verse 18.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.240
Once Hannah had expressed this prayer to Jehovah,

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.240
in effect, she just had thrown her burden onto him.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.240
Look at what verse 18 says.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.240
Her face was no longer downcast.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.240
Well, do you remember at the beginning, she was extremely bitter.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.240
Now it says her face was no longer downcast.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.240
What does it mean? Well, Jehovah was already giving her the strength

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.240
to be able to endure her situation.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.240
But it didn't end there because now look at verse 20.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.240
Within a year, it says, Hannah became pregnant.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:12.240
So Jehovah gave her the request of her heart.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.240
Well, can you imagine how Hannah must have felt?

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.240
If you look over at chapter 2 and verse 1, look what she says.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.240
My heart rejoices in Jehovah.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.240
My horn is exalted by Jehovah.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.240
My mouth is opened wide against my enemies,

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:35.240
for I rejoice in your acts of salvation.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:41.240
Well now, obviously, Hannah rejoiced that Jehovah had become her savior

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:45.240
and that she had experienced his acts of salvation.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.240
What's the point, brothers? What's the point?

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:54.240
Well, as individuals, we can pray to Jehovah with our specific distresses,

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.240
with our specific requests and concerns.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:01.240
We know that Jehovah honors those who honor him.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:05.240
And we know all of us have experienced when we feel

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.240
that Jehovah has heard our prayer,

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:12.240
and he is in some way acted in our behalf.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.240
But now let's look at another example.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.240
Here it's Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.240
Now, you remember those three faithful Hebrews were there

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.240
and the King Nebuchadnezzar had erected this golden image

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.240
and he said everyone had to bow down to it

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.240
or they would be thrown into the fiery furnace.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:35.240
Well, what did Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego do?

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:39.240
They absolutely refused to obey that order.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.240
They had to listen to Jehovah.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.240
Well, those men were tied up just as Nebuchadnezzar had warned.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:51.240
They were tied up and they were thrown into that fiery furnace.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.240
But now dear brothers, I want you to think about this.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:57.240
How do you imagine this scene in your mind?

00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.240
Do you think that as they were going into the fiery furnace

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.240
they were all in a panic and they were regretting their decision?

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.240
Oh, I'm so sorry that I didn't bow down to the image?

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.240
Absolutely not.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.240
Just look at what these men said.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.580
Look at Daniel, chapter three.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.580
Daniel, chapter three.

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:21.830
Let's look at verse 16 here.

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:26.830
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered the king.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:30.830
Oh, Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter.

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:34.830
If it must be, our God whom we serve is able to rescue us

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:39.830
from the burning fiery furnace and to rescue us from your hand.

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:44.830
But even if he does not let it be known to you, O King,

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:49.830
that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:52.830
that you have set up.

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:55.830
Well now, when you hear those words,

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:58.830
is there any regret there?

00:09:58.830 --> 00:09:59.830
Is there any weakness?

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:00.830
Is there any panic?

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:01.830
No.

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:04.830
Even though they were facing death.

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:09.830
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego faced it with courage.

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:11.830
They faced it with resolve.

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:14.830
They faced it with dignity.

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:18.830
Well, how they must have rejoiced when, after being rescued,

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:21.830
even Nebuchadnezzar himself had to praise Jehovah

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.830
for the way he had rescued his servants.

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:28.830
One of our brothers, what's the point of this review?

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:34.830
Obviously, in Bible times, Jehovah God has saved his people

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:36.830
both as a nation and as individuals.

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:40.830
And we know that Jehovah delights to do this

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:43.830
and that it is a cause for rejoicing

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:47.830
when Jehovah's servants experience his salvation.

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:51.830
But now, here's the question.

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:55.830
We know Jehovah delights to rescue us, to save us.

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.830
We know he's moved to do so by his loyal love.

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:01.830
But what does it really mean?

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:06.830
Does it mean today that when any sort of trial comes our way

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:08.830
that Jehovah is just going to rush in,

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:12.830
he's just going to intervene and rescue us every time?

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:14.830
No, it does not.

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:16.830
It does not mean that.

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:17.830
Now, why?

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:20.830
If Jehovah loves us and he has the power, why is it

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:24.830
that he isn't rescuing us from every situation?

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:28.830
Well, do you remember what Satan said to Jehovah about Job

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:30.830
in Job chapter 1?

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:34.830
See, Satan said, you've put a hedge around Job.

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:36.830
You've blessed everything he does.

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:38.830
You haven't allowed any calamity to come to him.

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:42.830
The only reason he serves you is just because of selfish reasons.

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:43.830
He doesn't really love you.

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:46.830
He just worships you for what he can get from you.

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:50.830
You see, that same charge could be made about any of us.

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:53.830
If Jehovah just rescued us from everything,

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:56.830
so what will Jehovah do?

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:59.830
Well, when we're facing trials, it's true,

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:04.830
in some circumstances, Jehovah may remove the trial.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:06.830
But in many other situations,

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:11.830
Jehovah may strengthen us so that we'll be able to review the trial.

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:14.830
Excuse me, endure the trial.

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:17.830
Either way, when we feel,

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:21.830
when we experience that Jehovah is acting on our behalf,

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:23.830
how does it make us feel?

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:27.830
We truly, truly rejoice.

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:29.830
You know, brothers, this is not theory.

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:34.830
This very week, I lost my own father in death.

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:36.830
My father was 90 years old.

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:40.830
He had served Jehovah faithfully for 63 years.

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:45.830
Now, brothers, this is a trial that every single one of us experience

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:47.830
as God's people.

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:49.830
But some of you like me,

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:51.830
we've experienced the death of a loved one

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:54.830
during this coronavirus pandemic.

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.830
I'll tell you, it's not an easy situation.

00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:00.830
But what can we say?

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:02.830
Well, I can say myself,

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:05.830
we have felt the love of Jehovah

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:07.830
in all of the emails,

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:09.830
in all of the phone calls,

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:12.830
in all the different ways brothers and sisters have found

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:15.830
to provide the support that we need.

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:17.830
That's been true, in my case.

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:19.830
I know it's been true for all of you

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:23.830
who've had the same or very similar experience at this difficult time.

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:26.830
Jehovah is giving us what we need

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:30.830
so that we can continue on to serve him faithfully.

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:36.830
And so, when some big trial comes your way, ask yourself,

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:40.830
am I confident that Jehovah's loyal love

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:45.830
is going to move him to act on my behalf?

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:49.830
Are his acts of salvation going to be manifest for me

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:52.830
so that I am going to feel them myself?

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:55.830
And then, does that confident

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:57.830
that Jehovah is going to intervene,

00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:00.830
that he is going to help us cause us to rejoice

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:04.830
and be happy in the knowledge that our God is with us?

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:06.830
When I'm in the following video,

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:09.830
I want you to take notice of this beautiful experience

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:15.830
of a dear sister who did not have the trial removed from her,

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:18.830
but just notice how Jehovah has strengthened her

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:22.590
to be able to endure.

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:32.590
I was born in Malawi in 1962.

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:35.590
I lost my eyesight at two years of age

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:38.590
because of an eye disease.

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:41.590
We have to rely on the reins for the food we eat

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:46.590
and sell as it is our only source of income.

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:49.590
I also look after both my parents.

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:52.590
My father is 99 years old

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:56.590
and my mother is 92 years old.

00:14:56.590 --> 00:15:00.590
Hoverty is very time consuming.

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:03.590
There are a lot of household chores to do

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:06.590
to keep things clean and neat,

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:10.590
like fetching water for our daily needs.

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:12.590
In the evening, after we've eaten,

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.590
this is the time for reading.

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:16.590
When I was young,

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:19.590
father took the lead in our family worship,

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:20.590
which he still does,

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:23.590
but now, because of his failing eyesight,

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:25.590
I read to them.

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:27.590
I read with my fingers,

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:30.590
so night time is no problem.

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:33.590
My fingers are my eyes.

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:37.590
One scripture that really touches my heart

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:40.590
is James 5.11, which says,

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:44.590
Look, we consider happy those who have endured.

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:47.590
Job endured his trials,

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:50.590
and at the end, he saw all the good that Jehovah

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:52.590
had blessed him with.

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:56.590
This convinces me that Jehovah who act in the near future,

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:59.590
blessing us with all the things we are lacking

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:01.590
for filling all his promises.

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:04.590
And so, I'm happy to endure.

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:11.100
God's kingdom and His sovereignty are first in my life.

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:16.100
It is only God's kingdom that will solve all these problems.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.100
I feel privileged that I've been able

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:23.100
to serve as a regular pioneer for 36 years now,

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:27.100
and I've been blessed to help 64 persons to know Jehovah.

00:16:30.179 --> 00:16:33.179
I'm so happy with songs 76.

00:16:33.179 --> 00:16:43.889
I don't see myself as poor.

00:16:43.889 --> 00:16:46.889
I have the Bible and many different publications

00:16:46.889 --> 00:16:47.889
in Jehovah Braille.

00:16:47.889 --> 00:16:49.889
We have the congregation,

00:16:49.889 --> 00:16:52.889
the ministry, and our brothers and sisters.

00:16:52.889 --> 00:16:56.889
All these things make me very happy.

00:16:56.889 --> 00:17:00.889
We are not worried about our current situation,

00:17:00.889 --> 00:17:03.889
because we are spiritually rich.

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:24.829
It wasn't that amazing to see that beautiful experience

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:25.829
of our sister.

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:28.829
Now, Jehovah hasn't taken away her trial.

00:17:28.829 --> 00:17:29.829
She's still blind.

00:17:29.829 --> 00:17:32.829
She still has a very limited means.

00:17:32.829 --> 00:17:34.829
But look how Jehovah has blessed her.

00:17:34.829 --> 00:17:37.829
Look how she's able to help so many people

00:17:37.829 --> 00:17:39.829
to come to know about Jehovah.

00:17:39.829 --> 00:17:40.829
How wonderful.

00:17:40.829 --> 00:17:43.829
But now, let's look at a second video.

00:17:43.829 --> 00:17:47.829
Now we're going to watch a video where Jehovah really did step in

00:17:47.829 --> 00:17:49.829
and remove a trial from our dear brother

00:17:49.829 --> 00:17:50.829
who is in a refugee camp.

00:17:50.829 --> 00:17:51.829
Let's watch.

00:17:53.829 --> 00:17:55.829
Because of the civil war,

00:17:55.829 --> 00:17:58.829
we had to take refuge in a safer part of the country.

00:17:58.829 --> 00:18:01.829
When we arrived, soldiers took us to internment camps

00:18:01.829 --> 00:18:05.829
to hold us until they could confirm our identities.

00:18:05.829 --> 00:18:07.829
In the camps, we lived in tents

00:18:07.829 --> 00:18:11.829
and it was unbearably hot in them.

00:18:11.829 --> 00:18:14.829
It was a struggle even to get water.

00:18:14.829 --> 00:18:20.829
We needed to wait in a queue for four to five hours every day.

00:18:20.829 --> 00:18:23.829
During the war, our eldest son was killed.

00:18:23.829 --> 00:18:27.829
It was a big loss for our family.

00:18:27.829 --> 00:18:30.829
All we could do to cope was pray to Jehovah

00:18:30.829 --> 00:18:34.829
and find comfort in the Bible.

00:18:34.829 --> 00:18:37.829
One day, the brothers from the Relief Committee came

00:18:37.829 --> 00:18:40.829
and informed us that a regional convention would be held.

00:18:40.829 --> 00:18:46.829
They had spoken to the camp officials requesting permission for us to go.

00:18:46.829 --> 00:18:49.829
For four days, morning and evening,

00:18:49.829 --> 00:18:52.829
we went to the officials to ask for permission.

00:18:52.829 --> 00:18:56.829
But they would not tell us if we would be released for the convention.

00:18:56.829 --> 00:18:59.829
Suddenly, when afternoon, much to our surprise,

00:18:59.829 --> 00:19:03.829
we were approved to leave the camp for five days.

00:19:03.829 --> 00:19:06.829
At that time, we had been in the internment camp for months.

00:19:06.829 --> 00:19:08.829
We had not been allowed to go anywhere.

00:19:08.829 --> 00:19:12.829
We were so happy that we got the permission to attend the convention.

00:19:12.829 --> 00:19:14.829
We never expected it.

00:19:14.829 --> 00:19:19.240
At the time, we had some clothes,

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:22.240
but we had nothing for the three-day convention.

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:27.240
However, the brothers outside the camp helped us enormously.

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:30.240
They were with us cared for all our needs,

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:35.349
so we could be ready for the convention.

00:19:35.349 --> 00:19:38.349
We still wondered where we were going to stay

00:19:38.349 --> 00:19:41.349
and how we would get our recommendations.

00:19:42.349 --> 00:19:44.349
However, when we arrived,

00:19:44.349 --> 00:19:47.349
the brothers hugged us and warmly welcomed us.

00:19:47.349 --> 00:19:50.349
We were really encouraged.

00:19:50.349 --> 00:19:55.349
Even though we faced many challenges and difficulties in the internment camp,

00:19:55.349 --> 00:19:58.349
that convention was like a nourishing meal for us.

00:19:58.349 --> 00:20:02.349
It was a real joy eating at Jehu was stable.

00:20:02.349 --> 00:20:05.349
We can never forget those moments.

00:20:05.349 --> 00:20:08.950
After the convention,

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:11.950
the brother from the governing body gave a special talk

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:15.950
from the internment camps that are really strengthened us.

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:20.619
The convention helped us to be courageous,

00:20:20.619 --> 00:20:23.619
especially after we returned to the camp.

00:20:23.619 --> 00:20:25.619
Although we faced many losses,

00:20:25.619 --> 00:20:28.619
the convention not only gave us comfort,

00:20:28.619 --> 00:20:31.619
but also helped us to face the challenges ahead.

00:20:31.619 --> 00:20:37.119
Now my younger son and I are serving as ministerial servants,

00:20:37.119 --> 00:20:42.119
and my wife has been serving as a regular pioneer for the past 17 years.

00:20:42.119 --> 00:20:47.119
She continued pioneering even while we were in the internment camp.

00:20:47.119 --> 00:20:50.119
We realized that Jehu was always there,

00:20:50.119 --> 00:20:53.119
caring for us and sustaining us continuously.

00:20:53.119 --> 00:20:58.529
So how wonderful that our amazing God Jehova

00:20:58.529 --> 00:21:00.529
helped this dear brother and his family

00:21:00.529 --> 00:21:03.529
so that they would be able to attend the convention.

00:21:03.529 --> 00:21:06.529
Well, dear brothers, what have we seen thus far in this talk?

00:21:06.529 --> 00:21:09.529
We've been able to see that in the past in Bible times,

00:21:09.529 --> 00:21:11.529
Jehova was the savior of his people.

00:21:11.529 --> 00:21:15.529
And in our modern times, right now we see how Jehova is strengthening us

00:21:15.529 --> 00:21:19.529
and acting on our behalf so that we can continue to serve him faithfully.

00:21:19.529 --> 00:21:22.529
But now what about the very near future?

00:21:22.529 --> 00:21:24.529
What can we say about that?

00:21:24.529 --> 00:21:30.529
Well, we know that these last days are very soon going to lead in to the great tribulation.

00:21:30.529 --> 00:21:33.529
As Jesus said at Matthew 24-21,

00:21:33.529 --> 00:21:37.529
this is going to be a great tribulation such as has not occurred

00:21:37.529 --> 00:21:42.529
since the world's beginning until now, nor will occur again.

00:21:42.529 --> 00:21:45.529
After the destruction of Babylon the Great

00:21:45.529 --> 00:21:50.529
and before the outbreak of Armageddon, what is going to happen?

00:21:50.529 --> 00:21:54.529
Gogg of Maygog, this coalition of nations

00:21:54.529 --> 00:21:59.529
is going to lead an all-out attack on Jehova's servants.

00:21:59.529 --> 00:22:05.529
Well now, knowing that that attack is coming closer and closer every day,

00:22:05.529 --> 00:22:09.529
how should we be feeling? Should it make us feel just completely filled with anxiety?

00:22:09.529 --> 00:22:13.529
Should we be in terror of those events that are coming?

00:22:13.529 --> 00:22:15.529
Not at all.

00:22:15.529 --> 00:22:20.529
Please read with me what Jesus said here in Revelation 2.

00:22:20.529 --> 00:22:24.529
Now in Revelation 2 in verse 10,

00:22:24.529 --> 00:22:29.529
Jesus is speaking to anointed Christians in the congregation of Smyrna.

00:22:29.529 --> 00:22:32.529
Now notice what he says to them.

00:22:32.529 --> 00:22:37.529
Do not be afraid of the things that you are about to suffer.

00:22:37.529 --> 00:22:41.529
Look, the devil will keep on throwing some of you into prison

00:22:41.529 --> 00:22:44.529
so that you may be fully put to the test

00:22:44.529 --> 00:22:47.529
and you will have tribulation for 10 days,

00:22:47.529 --> 00:22:51.529
prove yourself faithful even to death

00:22:51.529 --> 00:22:55.529
and I will give you the crown of life.

00:22:55.529 --> 00:22:59.529
Now what do we discern from these words of Jesus?

00:22:59.529 --> 00:23:03.529
Well first of all, those who die faithfully

00:23:03.529 --> 00:23:06.529
and keep their integrity are guaranteed

00:23:06.529 --> 00:23:09.529
to have salvation from Jehova.

00:23:09.529 --> 00:23:13.529
But there's something else that we can discern from these words.

00:23:13.529 --> 00:23:16.529
It tells us that during these last days,

00:23:16.529 --> 00:23:21.529
some of Jehova's servants are going to experience death.

00:23:21.529 --> 00:23:23.529
In our modern history already,

00:23:23.529 --> 00:23:26.529
we know our brothers have been thrown into prison,

00:23:26.529 --> 00:23:28.529
have been tortured and yes,

00:23:28.529 --> 00:23:30.529
some have even been put to death

00:23:30.529 --> 00:23:33.529
because of their integrity.

00:23:33.529 --> 00:23:35.529
In South Korea alone,

00:23:35.529 --> 00:23:38.529
over a period of some 70 years,

00:23:38.529 --> 00:23:44.529
19,352 of our brothers were in prison

00:23:44.529 --> 00:23:48.529
and five of those brothers were actually put to death

00:23:48.529 --> 00:23:50.529
because of their faith.

00:23:50.529 --> 00:23:53.529
Well what can we say about those brothers in South Korea?

00:23:53.529 --> 00:23:55.529
Those that died in Nazi Germany

00:23:55.529 --> 00:23:57.529
and those that died in Eritrea

00:23:57.529 --> 00:23:59.529
and those that died during the Soviet Union

00:23:59.529 --> 00:24:01.529
because of their faith?

00:24:01.529 --> 00:24:05.529
We know that their salvation is completely assured.

00:24:05.529 --> 00:24:09.529
They are completely safe in the safest place in the universe,

00:24:09.529 --> 00:24:14.529
the memory of our grand god Jehova.

00:24:14.529 --> 00:24:16.529
Well then, what about our brothers

00:24:16.529 --> 00:24:20.529
who are experiencing persecution right now?

00:24:20.529 --> 00:24:22.529
We know that some of our brothers

00:24:22.529 --> 00:24:25.529
are watching this program right now in countries

00:24:25.529 --> 00:24:29.529
where our work is banned or under very, very severe restriction.

00:24:29.529 --> 00:24:32.529
What can we say about those dear brothers and sisters?

00:24:32.529 --> 00:24:35.529
Well let's read together this encouraging thought.

00:24:35.529 --> 00:24:37.529
In Psalm 67,

00:24:37.529 --> 00:24:44.150
Psalm 67 and verse 1,

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:46.150
it says,

00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:50.150
God will show us favor and bless us.

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:53.150
He will make his face shine upon us

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:57.150
so that your way may be known throughout the earth

00:24:57.150 --> 00:25:01.150
your acts of salvation among all the nations.

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:02.150
What's the point?

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:05.150
You see Jehova is doing what verse 1 says.

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:08.150
He's showing his favor and he's blessing his people

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:11.150
in these countries where the work is under ban.

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:12.150
And as a result,

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:17.150
we are able to see Jehova's acts of salvation for his people.

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:19.150
Well now there are so many examples of this.

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:22.150
I wish we had another hour to be able to tell you all of them.

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:26.150
But I'd like to just share one experience that is similar

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:28.150
to many, many more that we have received.

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:30.150
It comes from Russia.

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:33.150
One of our sisters was there in the prison in Russia.

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:36.150
Two of the female prisoners who were in the cell with her

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:39.150
were imprisoned for selling drugs.

00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:42.150
Now one day these two prisoners began singing songs

00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:45.150
about criminal life.

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:47.150
Now the sister didn't understand the language,

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:49.150
but she just knew that the thoughts and the ideas

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:52.150
and these songs were immoral and foul

00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:54.150
and she just didn't want to be in that environment.

00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:57.150
So she prayed to Jehova to help her.

00:25:57.150 --> 00:26:01.150
Well suddenly one of the women began singing song number 120

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:03.150
from our former song book.

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:05.150
Well the sister was shocked.

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:07.150
How do you know this song she asked?

00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:10.150
Then they all sang the song together.

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:13.150
It turned out that this woman had learned the song

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:16.150
from her mother who had previously studied the Bible

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:19.150
of Jehovah's Witnesses and had memorized the song.

00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:23.150
Our sister felt the loving hand of Jehovah

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:26.150
in responding to her prayer so quickly.

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:29.150
Oh brothers, it's a wonderful experience,

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:31.150
but there are so many similar experiences

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:36.150
where Jehovah has shown his hand on behalf of his people

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:39.150
in small ways and sometimes in big ways.

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:43.150
But let's look at one other experience.

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:45.150
There are many examples of where our brothers

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:48.150
in the courtroom during their own trials

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:50.150
have made statements that are similar

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:54.150
to what Shadrach Meshach and Abednego said to Nebuchadnezzar.

00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:56.150
I just want to give you one example.

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:59.150
This is the statement from brother Sergei Skrinikov

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:03.150
that he gave in the courtroom at his own hearing.

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:06.150
Here's a small excerpt.

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:08.150
Let us take a look into the future.

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:11.150
If for another 10 years or so the government keeps putting

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:14.150
Jehovah's Witnesses into prisons and correctional colonies

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:18.150
there will be about 200 of them in every prison.

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:22.150
Imagine four congregations of Jehovah's Witnesses

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:23.150
in one prison.

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:27.150
The prison administrators will be begging the Ministry of Justice

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:29.150
to set Jehovah's Witnesses free.

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:32.150
What do you imagine the majority of the witnesses

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:33.150
will be praying for?

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:36.150
Lord, don't soften the heart of the government.

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:38.150
Don't let them set me free.

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:41.150
I have so many Bible students

00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:43.150
and sincere people to talk to.

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:45.150
Isn't that wonderful?

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:49.589
Just hear the confidence in his voice.

00:27:49.589 --> 00:27:53.589
But then look, look how he ended his statement to the court.

00:27:53.589 --> 00:27:55.589
Here's what he said.

00:27:55.589 --> 00:27:57.589
God is one and the same,

00:27:57.589 --> 00:27:59.589
whether we are free or in prison.

00:27:59.589 --> 00:28:01.589
Therefore, we are not abandoned.

00:28:01.589 --> 00:28:05.589
He is with us everywhere as long as we stay faithful to him.

00:28:05.589 --> 00:28:08.589
Hebrews 136 assures me,

00:28:08.589 --> 00:28:11.589
Jehovah is my helper.

00:28:11.589 --> 00:28:13.589
I will not be afraid.

00:28:13.589 --> 00:28:16.589
What can man do to me?

00:28:16.589 --> 00:28:21.589
Jehovah God himself will help me.

00:28:21.589 --> 00:28:24.589
Of whom should I be afraid?

00:28:24.589 --> 00:28:29.589
Well, Brother Skrinikov, this very humble brother

00:28:29.589 --> 00:28:32.589
made this powerful statement in the courtroom.

00:28:32.589 --> 00:28:34.589
What does it show us?

00:28:34.589 --> 00:28:37.589
Obviously, Jehovah is strengthening his people.

00:28:37.589 --> 00:28:40.589
He's giving them the power, the courage that they need

00:28:40.589 --> 00:28:42.589
to be so bold and so frank,

00:28:42.589 --> 00:28:46.589
even before these powerful authorities.

00:28:46.589 --> 00:28:50.589
Well, what do we expect in the very near future?

00:28:50.589 --> 00:28:53.589
This all-out attack of God of May,

00:28:53.589 --> 00:28:55.589
God will come against God's people.

00:28:55.589 --> 00:28:58.589
But when it begins, what is Jehovah going to do?

00:28:58.589 --> 00:29:02.589
Well, let me read to you just an excerpt

00:29:02.589 --> 00:29:05.589
from our pure worship book

00:29:05.589 --> 00:29:09.589
that just beautifully expresses what we can expect to see.

00:29:09.589 --> 00:29:12.589
Before they are destroyed,

00:29:12.589 --> 00:29:15.589
our enemies will see the sign of the Son of Man

00:29:15.589 --> 00:29:19.589
likely a supernatural manifestation of the power

00:29:19.589 --> 00:29:21.589
of Jehovah and Jesus.

00:29:21.589 --> 00:29:26.589
The opposers will see things that cause them extreme anxiety.

00:29:26.589 --> 00:29:30.589
As Jesus foretold, people will become faint out of fear

00:29:30.589 --> 00:29:34.589
and expectation of the things coming upon the inhabited earth

00:29:34.589 --> 00:29:36.589
to their horror.

00:29:36.589 --> 00:29:39.589
They will realize that they miscalculated

00:29:39.589 --> 00:29:42.589
when they attacked Jehovah's people.

00:29:42.589 --> 00:29:45.589
They will be forced to know the creator in his role

00:29:45.589 --> 00:29:49.589
as military commander, Jehovah of armies.

00:29:49.589 --> 00:29:52.589
Jehovah will no doubt unleash heavenly armies

00:29:52.589 --> 00:29:57.589
and natural forces in such a way that he protects his loyal servants

00:29:57.589 --> 00:30:00.589
but eliminates his enemies.

00:30:00.589 --> 00:30:02.589
What a powerful description.

00:30:02.589 --> 00:30:05.589
It just reminds me of our video,

00:30:05.589 --> 00:30:07.589
a couple of years ago at a regional convention

00:30:07.589 --> 00:30:10.589
where we saw those forces coming against God's people

00:30:10.589 --> 00:30:11.589
and then what did we see?

00:30:11.589 --> 00:30:13.589
Well, suddenly from the heavens,

00:30:13.589 --> 00:30:16.589
here is Jesus Christ, the 144,000

00:30:16.589 --> 00:30:19.589
and all those heavenly armies riding into battle.

00:30:19.589 --> 00:30:22.589
And you remember Jesus just pulls back that bow

00:30:22.589 --> 00:30:24.589
and lets that arrow go

00:30:24.589 --> 00:30:27.589
and all of those enemies are gone forever.

00:30:27.589 --> 00:30:30.589
Brothers and sisters, don't you just long

00:30:30.589 --> 00:30:32.589
for the day when you will see those things

00:30:32.589 --> 00:30:34.589
with your own eyes?

00:30:34.589 --> 00:30:36.589
What a wonderful time.

00:30:36.589 --> 00:30:41.589
That will be when we experience the salvation of Jehovah.

00:30:41.589 --> 00:30:44.589
Well, what can we say?

00:30:44.589 --> 00:30:47.589
As we have discussed this wonderful topic of Jehovah

00:30:47.589 --> 00:30:50.589
as our grand savior?

00:30:50.589 --> 00:30:52.589
Well, when we look to the future,

00:30:52.589 --> 00:30:54.589
we really can have the confidence

00:30:54.589 --> 00:30:57.589
of what Isaiah chapter 12 and verse 2 says.

00:30:57.589 --> 00:30:58.589
Let's read it.

00:30:58.589 --> 00:31:01.589
Isaiah chapter 12.

00:31:02.589 --> 00:31:04.589
And verse 2.

00:31:04.589 --> 00:31:08.589
It says, look, God is my salvation.

00:31:08.589 --> 00:31:11.589
I will trust and feel no dread

00:31:11.589 --> 00:31:15.589
for Jehovah is my strength and my might

00:31:15.589 --> 00:31:18.589
and he has become my salvation.

00:31:18.589 --> 00:31:20.589
Well, just as Isaiah said,

00:31:20.589 --> 00:31:23.589
we have no reason to fear,

00:31:23.589 --> 00:31:25.589
we have no reason to dread

00:31:25.589 --> 00:31:29.589
if we have our confidence in our God Jehovah.

00:31:29.589 --> 00:31:33.589
Now, whether we face death with dignity

00:31:33.589 --> 00:31:35.589
during these last days

00:31:35.589 --> 00:31:38.589
or we experience miraculous deliverance

00:31:38.589 --> 00:31:40.589
at the great tribulation,

00:31:40.589 --> 00:31:43.589
either way, what can we say?

00:31:43.589 --> 00:31:47.589
We know that we will have the same outcome.

00:31:47.589 --> 00:31:50.589
We will all experience the salvation

00:31:50.589 --> 00:31:52.589
that comes from our God, Jehovah,

00:31:52.589 --> 00:31:53.589
because what is the assurance

00:31:53.589 --> 00:31:56.589
that Isaiah 54 and verse 17 gives us?

00:31:56.589 --> 00:31:59.589
No weapon formed against you

00:31:59.589 --> 00:32:02.589
will have any success.

00:32:02.589 --> 00:32:05.589
Well, brothers, if we have that confidence

00:32:05.589 --> 00:32:08.589
that Jehovah truly is our grand savior,

00:32:08.589 --> 00:32:10.589
then no matter what calamity,

00:32:10.589 --> 00:32:12.589
no matter what terror,

00:32:12.589 --> 00:32:14.589
no matter what trial may come upon us now

00:32:14.589 --> 00:32:15.589
or in the future,

00:32:15.589 --> 00:32:18.589
we will be able to continue to rejoice

00:32:18.589 --> 00:32:22.589
in Jehovah's acts of salvation.
