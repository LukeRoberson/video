00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:10.019
Our text is all about hope, and maintaining a positive attitude, despite our circumstances.

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:16.699
The word hope, as it's used in the Bible, is very nicely defined as the expectation

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:23.500
of good things to happen, the expectation that good things will happen.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:30.339
Now, that's a good mindset to have, trying to stay positive during difficult times.

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:38.820
In our scriptural text in 1 Thessalonians 5-8, Paul connects hope with the helmet that

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.859
is worn by the Roman soldier.

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:48.899
And in our spiritual warfare, we want to wear the hope of salvation as a helmet to protect

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:56.420
our minds from Satan's temptations and ideas designed to corrupt our thinking and create

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:03.740
negative emotions that can cause us to be hopeless instead of hopeful.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.140
The watchtower that we're considering this morning, it made this comment.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.700
Some might reason, I will never be among those who live forever.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.500
I am just not good enough.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.659
I will never be able to measure up to God's standards.

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.780
And the devil knows that if we allow ourselves to dwell on such negative thoughts, then our

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.099
hope will fade.

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:38.500
So to keep hope alive in your heart, work hard each day to live with the expectation that

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.980
good things will happen.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:48.540
One example I would like to discuss this morning briefly of one who kept an expectation of

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.500
good things was Joseph.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.700
Please turn with me to Genesis chapter 40.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.780
Now we remember the account in Genesis chapter 39 where Joseph was wrongly accused of

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.739
attempted rape of Potiphar's wife and as a result, he was imprisoned.

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:13.099
And then in chapter 40, in verses 1 through 4, it discusses the chief baker and the chief

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:18.900
cup bear as sinning against Potiphar, and they too were thrown into prison along with

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.740
Joseph.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:28.400
In verse 5 of chapter 40, mentions the cup bearer and the baker, they both have a dream one

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.900
night, and apparently this dream disturbs each one of them.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:40.099
Note Joseph's response in verses 6 and 7 when he sees the cup bearer and the baker the

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.460
next morning.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.539
This is a good lesson that can help us to stay positive throughout adversity.

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:48.900
Verses 6 and 7, it says.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.379
The next morning, when Joseph came in and saw them, they looked, dejected.

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:00.300
So he asked the officers of Pharaoh who were in custody with him in his master's house,

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.180
why are your faces gloomy today?

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.180
That's interesting.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.740
Despite being in prison himself, Joseph still cared about others.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:19.620
When you go through a challenging situation and you begin to lose hope, focus on others.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:26.180
Jesus said that there's more happiness in giving, so when we focus less on ourselves and

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:34.780
more on others, that can keep our hope alive because we experience a greater happiness.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:42.580
Well, eventually Joseph interprets the dreams of the cup bearer and the baker.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.819
Let's read his interpretation.

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.580
It's in verses 12 and 13.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.979
It says, then Joseph said to him, this is the interpretation.

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:56.659
The three twigs are three days.

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:02.419
Three days from now, Pharaoh will bring you out, restoring you to your office, and you

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:08.620
will put Pharaoh's cup into his hand as you did before when you were his cup bearer.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.259
Wow, that's good news for the cup bearer.

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:15.620
He's going to be released, and he's going to get his old job back.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.860
Well, how does Joseph feel about this cup bearer's good news?

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.500
Notice what Joseph says to the cup bearer, verse 14.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.660
Nevertheless, you must remember me when things go well with you.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:38.060
Please show me loyal love and mention me to Pharaoh in order to get me out of this place.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:44.420
Joseph wanted relief from that sweltering filthy prison.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:52.699
Have you ever felt that way in prison in a challenging assignment, trapped in an aging

00:04:52.699 --> 00:05:03.660
body and a failing mind, confined by negative emotions, or stuck in a difficult family situation?

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.699
The reality is we're all trapped in some way.

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:11.939
And perhaps you say to Jehovah, get me out of this place.

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:15.019
Well, what did Jehovah do for Joseph?

00:05:15.019 --> 00:05:16.019
Did he get him out?

00:05:16.019 --> 00:05:17.620
No, he didn't.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:26.100
Joseph was still confined to that prison for years, and the cup bearer did nothing to help Joseph get out.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.100
But you know what Jehovah did for Joseph?

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:36.779
Jehovah caused Joseph's interpretations to come true for both the cup bearer and the baker.

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:45.660
This was evidence that Jehovah was with Joseph, and this kept Joseph in expectation

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.699
that good things would happen.

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:50.860
That's hope.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:56.699
So when facing difficult challenges and you call out to Jehovah, get me out of this place.

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:05.139
If the answer is no, always remember that Jehovah has already done good things for you.

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:08.819
The watchtower we're considering this morning, it says this.

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:13.139
When you meditate on what God has done for you already,

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:18.620
you will strengthen your hope in what He will do for you in the future.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:25.579
This helps us to stay hopeful and keep an expectation that good things will happen.

00:06:25.579 --> 00:06:30.899
I was communicating with a circuit overseer about a week ago, and he reminded me of a beautiful experience

00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:36.819
illustrating the importance of staying positive in difficult situations.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:44.379
It involved an older sister from New Orleans, Louisiana, who had to be evacuated to Houston

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:48.699
during the terrible storm, Hurricane Katrina.

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:52.899
As you know, these evacuation centers, they were absolutely horrible.

00:06:52.899 --> 00:06:54.899
There was chaos.

00:06:54.899 --> 00:06:59.379
And so naturally, our relief brothers were organized to go into these facilities to help

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:00.379
our brothers and sisters.

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:06.259
So they would hold up signs of the watchtower and awake, and the brothers and sisters

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.899
in these facilities would see the signs.

00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:14.819
They would run to the brothers in tears because finally they were getting help.

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:19.540
Well, on one occasion, they went into the Houston Astridome to look for more friends.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:25.459
And one of the brothers reported that on this occasion, he saw an older woman

00:07:25.459 --> 00:07:28.980
who was standing off in the distance, all by herself.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:33.660
He said, he thought it was strange because she was in the middle of all this confusion,

00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:38.259
and she was just standing there, smiling.

00:07:38.259 --> 00:07:41.019
He couldn't get his eyes off of her.

00:07:41.019 --> 00:07:46.259
Well, after they finished gathering up a lot of the friends, they prepared to leave the

00:07:46.259 --> 00:07:52.459
facility, but still the brother couldn't get the sister off of his mind.

00:07:52.459 --> 00:07:58.420
And he was still standing there smiling, or rather the woman off of his mind.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:02.620
Finally, the brother excused himself from the group and he says,

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.899
I need to check something out.

00:08:04.899 --> 00:08:06.220
So he approached as the woman.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:12.300
He said, I don't know why I did it, but he asked the woman, man, if you don't mind me asking,

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.899
would you by chance be one of Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:08:15.899 --> 00:08:20.019
And then he said in response, her smile got bigger.

00:08:20.019 --> 00:08:25.060
And then she started to cry profusely.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:30.379
And then she said, this, yes, I am, I'm your sister.

00:08:30.379 --> 00:08:38.179
I just knew the brothers would come here looking for us, but I want you to know I'm blind.

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:40.779
She couldn't see the signs.

00:08:40.779 --> 00:08:42.299
I don't know any of these people.

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:45.539
I was concerned that when the brothers came, they wouldn't be able to find me.

00:08:45.539 --> 00:08:54.299
I've been praying to Jehovah after praying to Jehovah the thought came to me just smile.

00:08:54.299 --> 00:08:56.500
That's what I've been doing.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.139
And Jehovah found me.

00:08:59.139 --> 00:09:00.820
Just a point.

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:08.580
When you're going through adverse challenges, facing trials, sometimes just smile.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:14.299
Never lose hope and always be assured, Jehovah will find you.

00:09:14.299 --> 00:09:20.700
Make the best use of your present circumstances like Joseph and pray for endurance.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:26.100
If Jehovah doesn't answer your prayer to get you out of this place, take note of the

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:30.299
many other ways Jehovah has blessed you.

00:09:30.299 --> 00:09:41.539
Ecclesiastes 6.9, it says, better to enjoy what the eye see than to wonder after one's desires.

00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:47.980
Solomon acknowledged that it's wise for us to face reality rather than be obsessed with

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.379
negative circumstances.

00:09:50.379 --> 00:09:56.059
The Watchtower once stated, if we are humble, we will find it easier to accept life

00:09:56.139 --> 00:10:01.419
as it is, not as we think it should be.

00:10:01.419 --> 00:10:05.940
Sometimes we feel the grass is greener on the other side, but really the grass is greener

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.820
where we water it.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:10.019
Water the grass where you are planted.

00:10:10.019 --> 00:10:14.179
Keep on the helmet of salvation and stay hopeful.

00:10:14.179 --> 00:10:19.500
Because with Jehovah, we can always expect that good things will happen.
