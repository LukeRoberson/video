00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:08.820
In the 11th century BCE, the nation of Syria would often attack Israel, capturing many and

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.960
making many of their slaves, even children.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.800
Notice how the Bible describes one of these raids at Second Kings chapter 5.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.940
Second Kings chapter 5, and in verse 1, we are told that Naaman was the army chief of

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.140
the Syrians.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.980
He was a mighty warrior, but he was also very sick with leprosy.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.679
But notice verse 2, on wonder of their raids, the Syrians had taken captive from the land

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:43.520
of Israel a little girl who became a servant to Naaman's wife.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.880
Can you picture this little girl being ripped away from her parents?

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.740
It was frightening for her.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.759
She was taken to a strange land with people that were intimidating, and they worshipped

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:56.960
many false gods.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.079
In that very difficult circumstance, how was this little girl required to exercise

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.280
strong faith?

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.430
Please note the answer to this question in the following video.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.590
I remember the day the soldiers took me away.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.709
I had never felt more alone.

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:26.069
My home, my friends, everything I knew was gone.

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:30.840
But I still had Jehovah.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.439
The master of the house was very sick.

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.480
He was in pain.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.280
Elijah could help him.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.200
I had heard about Elijah's miracles.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.159
He had even raised the dead.

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:56.799
I knew Elijah could cure him, and Jehovah gave me the courage to speak up.

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:03.120
Despite being away from her parents, this little girl exercised strong faith.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.519
Where did she get that faith?

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:10.639
Well, no doubt her parents had inculcated love and trust for Jehovah in her.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:15.840
But she also had things that were happening in her lifetime that would build her faith.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.960
For example, she would have known about the miracles of the prophet Elijah.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.719
But how would Jehovah's spirit perform many miracles, including raising a little boy

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:30.120
from the dead?

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.520
This little girl could have reasoned why if Jehovah can raise a little boy from death,

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.599
he can certainly cure my master from his disease.

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.319
Well, what did she do with this faith and trust?

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.680
She spoke up courageously.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:53.680
Notice her words to her mistress as recorded at 2 Kings chapter 5 and verse 3.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.680
She said to her mistress,

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:03.400
if only my Lord would visit the prophet in Samaria, then he would cure him of his laprosy.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:10.560
Such bonus, and because she spoke up, Nehaman went to Israel,

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.039
God in touch with Elijah the prophet,

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:21.039
humbled himself, listened to the instructions, and was completely cured of the laprosy.

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:24.840
But something else very important occurred.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.039
Because of Nehaman coming to know about Jehovah, what did he declare?

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:31.039
At 2 Kings 5, 15, he said,

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:37.560
Now I know there is no God anywhere in the earth, but in Israel.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.240
And Nehaman also vowed that he would never serve any other gods, but Jehovah.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.080
How happy Nehaman and his entire household was when he went home, not only was he cured

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:55.319
of his laprosy, but now he was a happy, joyful servant of Jehovah.

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:02.000
Well, it's not just in Bible times that good experiences like this have occurred.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.319
As you watch the following dramatization, notice how one of our sisters shows strong faith

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:16.319
even under the most difficult of circumstances.

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:27.939
I was taken from my home, my husband, and my spiritual family.

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:38.730
I was imprisoned for my faith.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.290
It was another world.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:53.180
It wasn't easy staying strong.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:05:05.509
Every time I asked for a Bible, the answer was no.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:14.920
God's word was already in my heart, so I did what I loved the most.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.279
I talked about God's kingdom.

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:26.439
Many of those I preached to seemed cold at first, but genuine love and the warmth of God's

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:31.180
word just seemed to melt their hearts.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:38.300
Sometimes speaking up took more courage than I thought I had, but not more courage than

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:55.370
Jehovah could give me.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:01.769
It was hard to look beyond the locks and uniforms, but God's will is that all sorts of people

00:06:01.769 --> 00:06:04.449
learn about him.

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:08.250
So I spoke about my God, Jehovah.

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:56.560
I knew that even behind prison bars, Jehovah would give me the strength to help others.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.360
At this point, we'd like to address our young ones in the audience.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:08.959
You too can have strong faith like the little Israelite girl and tell others about Jehovah.

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:13.319
Remember the words of Romans chapter 10 verses 13 and 14?

00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:19.199
It is so important that people know about Jehovah, but how can they know about him and gain

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:23.160
salvation if there's no one to preach?

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:27.000
You too can become a bold and faithful preacher of the good news.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.879
Now, by taking in Bible truths and building up strong faith in your heart, and then you

00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:37.240
will be able to do like our sister did in the dramatization.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.040
Remember what she said?

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:45.720
I had God's word in my heart and as a result, even in prison, when I was surrounded by

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:53.399
all those difficulties, I did what I love to do talk about God's kingdom.

00:07:53.399 --> 00:07:58.040
Another thing you can do is pray for more courage and faith.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.920
Remember what our sister said?

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:05.759
It seemed that at times to speak up required more courage than I had, but not more courage

00:08:05.759 --> 00:08:09.319
than Jehovah could give me.

00:08:09.319 --> 00:08:17.199
So dear young ones, don't be afraid to talk about Jehovah and the truth to your schoolmates,

00:08:17.199 --> 00:08:21.720
so you're unbelieving relatives to your teachers.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.800
And results will happen, for example.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:29.000
There's an experience of a schoolteacher here in the United States who had been searching

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
for the basic questions as to the meaning of life, but she could not find them.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.440
But then her twelve-year-old student at school asked the teacher three questions, the first

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.440
question.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.279
Do you know I'm one of Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:44.279
Yes.

00:08:44.279 --> 00:08:47.279
Would you like to learn more about Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:08:47.279 --> 00:08:48.279
Yes.

00:08:48.279 --> 00:08:52.000
Third question, where do you live?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.799
Our twelve-year-old sister started a study with her teacher, the teacher loved what she

00:08:56.799 --> 00:09:02.559
was hearing, made excellent progress, and was baptized.

00:09:02.559 --> 00:09:07.960
That sister, the former schoolteacher, has been serving Jehovah now for many decades.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:13.480
In fact, for the last forty years she has been serving as a member of the United States

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.240
Bethel family.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:20.240
So blessings come when we speak up and show strong faith.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:25.080
Remember in the case of the little Israelite girl, Naaman would have never gone to Israel

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.240
if she had not spoken up.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:32.840
And as a result, he was cured but also became a servant of Jehovah.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:39.720
So in harmony with the strong faith of that captive Israelite girl, may Jehovah give

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:46.559
all of us the courage we need to display our strong faith, even under the most stressful

00:09:46.559 --> 00:09:51.049
and even frightening circumstances.

00:09:51.049 --> 00:09:55.809
For the Jeffrey Jackson will now consider the next talk of this symposium, imitate

00:09:55.809 --> 00:10:00.210
women of strong faith, marry the mother of Jesus.
