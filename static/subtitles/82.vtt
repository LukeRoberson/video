00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:09.779
Welcome, brothers and sisters. In this month's program, we'll review who the May 2020

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:16.620
Watchtower identified as the King of the North, and we'll learn how knowing this affects

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:26.120
each one of us. We'll also see how Perseverance helps us reach our spiritual goals, and will

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:36.780
debut an exciting new series made especially for teenagers. This is J. W. Broadcasting for May

00:00:36.780 --> 00:01:06.209
2021. My theme is the King of the North in the time of the end. In recent years, the Russian

00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:11.930
government has persecuted our brothers and sisters who live in that country. You've heard

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.329
reports about the police invading kingdom halls and breaking up meetings. The government

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:25.689
has labeled Jehovah's Witnesses as an extremist group. It has seized our properties and imprisoned

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:32.489
our brothers. Please watch a brief video that reviews some of the trials Jehovah's people

00:01:32.489 --> 00:01:41.400
in Russia have faced. On April 20, 2017, the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:51.129
criminalized the activity of Jehovah's Witnesses. As of July 4, 2019, authorities have progressively

00:01:51.129 --> 00:01:57.530
seized 131 of the properties owned by Jehovah's Witnesses with an additional 60 properties

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.329
subject to confiscation. One of the seized properties was the former Russia branch complex

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:09.689
in Solishnoia. At the time of filming, the Russian authorities continue their aggressive attack

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:16.569
on Jehovah's Witnesses. As of August 17, 2020, there were 42 witnesses who were in pre-trial

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:23.770
attention or sentenced to prison people, 32 who were under house arrest and 169 who were not

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.370
allowed to leave their home town. All have been charged with organizing, participating in,

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:37.050
or financing the activity of so-called extremist organization. At least 380 witnesses were at the

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:44.810
time under investigation, ranging in age from 19 to 89 years old. What has this meant for the

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:52.889
individuals affected? As an example, on June 3, 2018, brother Sergei Klymoff was arrested.

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:59.370
Local authorities initiated criminal charges against him, placing him in pre-trial detention

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:06.569
for two months. This detention was extended seven times, separating him from his wife and family

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:14.490
for a year and five months before he was finally tried and sentenced. On November 5, 2019,

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:24.169
he was sentenced to six years in prison. Two of our dear young people in Russia,

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:29.770
brother Yegor Baranov and sister Daria Dulova, are courageously facing criminal conviction

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:36.889
and potential long-term imprisonment. Brother Baranov is only 19 years old. When the authorities

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:45.340
raided her home, sister Dulova was only 18 years old. By means of the newsroom on JW Walk,

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.300
we're informed of updated news events. This page includes links to name lists of witnesses

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.500
currently in prison for their faith, which can help us include them specifically in our prayers.

00:03:56.539 --> 00:04:01.979
Our brothers and sisters in Russia are resolved to remain loyal to Jehovah, despite any opposition

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:07.580
and they put their confidence in him in the assurance that Jehovah is on their side.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:27.079
It shouldn't surprise us that this powerful government has been persecuting our peaceful

00:04:27.079 --> 00:04:35.480
law abiding brothers and sisters. Why not? Because that government is fulfilling Bible prophecy.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:45.480
Please find Daniel chapter 11. In verse 40, it refers to what the Bible calls the King of the North.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:54.759
Of that King Daniel 1141 says, he will also enter into the land of the decoration

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:05.079
and many lands will be made to stumble. Today, Russia and its allies are filling the role of

00:05:05.079 --> 00:05:11.720
the King of the North. Daniel foretold that this King would enter the land of the decoration,

00:05:12.519 --> 00:05:18.120
meaning that he would interfere in a significant way with the activities of God's people.

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:26.040
As discussed in the May 2020 watchtower, Russia and its allies are not the first political

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.319
power to act as the King of the North, but they may well be the last.

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:39.959
In this program, we will do three things. First, we'll briefly trace the fulfillment of the

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:48.120
prophecy recorded in Daniel chapter 11. Second, we'll look at how that prophecy is being

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:55.959
fulfilled today. And third, we'll discuss how knowing this information should affect the decisions

00:05:55.959 --> 00:06:04.199
that we make. Brother Herman Vansom, a helper to the writing committee, will help us review some of

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:12.680
the key points of the prophecy recorded in Daniel 11. Thank you, Herman, for helping me with this

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:22.279
presentation. It's a pleasure to be with you, Ken. Thank you for inviting me. First, let's briefly

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:30.279
trace how the prophecy has been fulfilled so far. The prophecy in Daniel 11 mentions the King

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:37.720
of the North and the King of the South. Now, why are they described like that? Well, initially these

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:46.120
powers were located north and south of the literal land of Israel, thus the names King of the North

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:54.439
and King of the South. These powers could be viewed as two thrones. Over time, those thrones have

00:06:54.439 --> 00:07:00.519
been occupied by various political powers and these rival kings compete for world domination.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:08.199
And what about Jehovah's people? They are right at the center of this conflict.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:16.920
But let's start at the beginning. Ken, what is the origin of the kings of the North and of the

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:25.240
South? The kings of the North and of the South both rose from the empire established by Alexander

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:33.319
the Great. One line of kings ruled over Egypt, which is south of Israel, and that dynasty was the

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:40.839
first to fill the role of King of the South. During this period, another line of kings ruled an

00:07:40.839 --> 00:07:49.720
area north of Israel and those kings filled the role of King of the North. Then the Roman Empire

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:58.649
took over as King of the North. As discussed in the May 2020 watchtower, God's people are the

00:07:58.649 --> 00:08:06.970
focal point of the prophecy recorded in Daniel 11. The angel who spoke with Daniel said that the

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:14.730
prophecy would help him understand what will befall your people. That is the nation of Israel.

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:25.290
And what in fact happened? Well, the Jewish nation was God's people until 33 CE. But after that,

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:32.250
a change occurred. Jehovah poured out his Holy Spirit on Christ's followers and from then on,

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:42.330
the congregation of true Christians became God's people. Galatians 6 verse 16 refers to them as

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:51.210
the Israel of God. That point is significant because the kings of the North and South can only

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:58.970
be identified when there is a clearly defined group of God's people on earth. Why is that the case?

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:07.690
Because as we just considered, the angel had told Daniel that the prophecy centers on God's people.

00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:16.649
In the second century CE, true Christians were overgrown by wheat-like false Christians.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:22.169
In this illustration of the wheat and the wheat, Jesus foretold that this would happen.

00:09:23.129 --> 00:09:33.210
That illustration is recorded at Matthew 13 verses 36 to 43. So, from the second century onward,

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:38.970
we can no longer identify an organized group of true Christians. And as we consider,

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:45.049
for that same reason, we also cannot identify the king of the North and the king of the South.

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:53.129
But in the 1870s, a group of Bible students began to separate itself from false Christians.

00:09:53.850 --> 00:10:00.889
This group, which included Charles T. Russell, rejected teachings that were not based on the Bible.

00:10:01.529 --> 00:10:07.370
And like the first century Christians, they promoted the truths taught in God's word.

00:10:08.169 --> 00:10:15.370
Now, this group underwent a development that is foretold at Malachi chapter 3 verse 1.

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:21.450
They were the messenger who would clear up a way before Jehovah.

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:27.610
And as events that followed proof, this group clearly had God's backing.

00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:34.330
So, from the 1870s onward, when true Christians began to organize themselves as a group,

00:10:35.049 --> 00:10:42.009
we can again identify the political powers that fill the roles of the king of the North and

00:10:42.009 --> 00:10:50.730
king of the South. At that time in history, Britain was the dominant political force. And it

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:58.730
filled the role of the king of the South. Amazingly, it was also in the 1870s that the German

00:10:59.289 --> 00:11:06.330
empire emerged and soon began to challenge Britain for world domination. This political power

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:15.370
now filled the role of the king of the North. Daniel 11 verse 25 and 26 indicated that the two

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:21.610
kings would clash and that the king of the North would lose many soldiers in the battle.

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:30.409
And that is exactly what happened during World War I. And it was during that war that Britain

00:11:30.409 --> 00:11:38.570
and its close ally, the United States, forged a special bond. So, from this point on during

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:44.330
these last days, the Anglo-American power has been the king of the South.

00:11:45.049 --> 00:11:55.129
That brings us to our second point. How has Daniel 11 been fulfilled from that time onward

00:11:55.129 --> 00:12:02.409
until recent times? During World War I, the king of the North and the king of the South

00:12:03.129 --> 00:12:09.529
persecuted those of God's people who refused to fight in the war, the king of the South even

00:12:09.529 --> 00:12:15.929
threw into jail those who were taking the lead in the preaching work. But let's take a closer look

00:12:15.929 --> 00:12:22.730
at the king of the North. Has the political power filling that role changed during the last days?

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:30.889
And how has it treated God's people? The identity of the king of the North has changed three times

00:12:30.889 --> 00:12:37.370
during the last days. Starting in the 1870s, through to the end of the Second World War,

00:12:38.009 --> 00:12:45.129
the German Empire filled the role of the king of the North. In the period leading up to and

00:12:45.129 --> 00:12:52.970
including World War II, it persecuted God's people without mercy, imprisoning thousands of our

00:12:52.970 --> 00:13:00.490
brothers and killing hundreds of them. Who replaced the German Empire as the king of the North?

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:08.090
That's an important question, Herman. After World War II, the Soviet Union took on that role.

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:13.850
It also attacked God's people, imprisoning them or sending them into exile.

00:13:14.809 --> 00:13:24.169
But can Daniel 11 for 34 says that they, that is God's people, would be given a little help?

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:31.049
What's the significance of that statement? This passage points forward to the time when the Soviet

00:13:31.049 --> 00:13:38.169
Union collapsed. Although God's people suffered terribly under that government, they were given

00:13:38.169 --> 00:13:46.809
a little help. In what way? After the USSR collapsed, God's people there could worship freely

00:13:46.809 --> 00:13:54.730
for a number of years. In time, though, Russia and its allies took on the role of the king of the

00:13:54.730 --> 00:14:01.049
North. And like the other powers that filled the role of king of the North, this government has

00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:09.450
continued to oppress God's people. Let's watch the following video that outlines what has happened.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Daniel received a prophecy about the coming of two rivals, the king of the North and the king

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:35.580
of the South. How has it been fulfilled? In the late 1800s, the German Empire became the king of

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:41.500
the North. That government brought its power and heart against the king of the South with a large

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:51.779
army. In fact, its navy was the second largest on earth who became the king of the South.

00:14:52.259 --> 00:15:00.740
The alliance between Britain and the United States. He fought during World War I with an exceedingly

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:10.950
large and mighty army. He swept away and humbled the king of the North. But that was not the end of

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:16.629
the king of the North. He turned his attention to and then hurled denunciations against the Holy

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:24.149
Covenant. He removed the constant feature by limiting the freedom of God's people to preach,

00:15:25.909 --> 00:15:32.779
imprisoning many and even killing hundreds of God's anointed ones and their fellow workers.

00:15:36.169 --> 00:15:41.610
After Germany was defeated in World War II, the Soviet Union became the king of the North.

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:48.330
It worked with the king of the South to put in place the disgusting thing that causes desolation.

00:15:48.570 --> 00:16:06.120
The United Nations. Beginning in the early 1900s, the Soviet government tried to eliminate

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:13.850
religion in the lands under its control, fulfilling the words that he would show no regard for the God

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:28.059
of his fathers. He gave glory not to the God of heaven, but to the God of fortresses. As prophesied,

00:16:28.059 --> 00:16:33.259
he used this military might against the king of the South by engaging with him in a pushing.

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:40.779
Anglo-America competed with the Soviet Union for world domination, fighting in and supporting wars

00:16:40.779 --> 00:16:52.710
and political struggles around the globe. After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, it was unclear

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:58.070
who would fill the role of the king of the North. For a time, God's people there had been able

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:05.559
to preach and worship peacefully. But in recent years, Russia and its allies have pushed back at

00:17:05.559 --> 00:17:11.960
the king of the South. Both kings have accused each other of destructive cyber and economic attacks.

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:17.640
But the king of the North has not limited his attacks to the king of the South.

00:17:18.759 --> 00:17:25.559
As foretold, he also entered into the land of the decoration, our realm of spiritual activity.

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:35.299
Today, Russian authorities continue to attack true worship. We expect such persecution.

00:17:35.700 --> 00:18:03.029
But we also expect it to end. Our king, Jesus Christ, is more powerful than any human government.

00:18:03.029 --> 00:18:11.539
Soon, he will destroy not only the kings of the North, South, but all of his enemies.

00:18:13.299 --> 00:18:16.420
And he will deliver God's loyal people.

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:54.730
That was a powerful and touching video. How are our brothers and sisters coping with the current

00:18:54.730 --> 00:19:01.369
persecution? Let's take a look. And what you're going to see will break your heart,

00:19:02.009 --> 00:19:12.920
but also strengthen your faith. At 6 a.m., my husband and I were woken up by a loud bang on the door.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:17.880
As soon as my husband had opened the door, people burst in shouting, everyone on the floor.

00:19:18.759 --> 00:19:24.920
I saw them taking my husband into the kitchen and heard them very aggressively ordering him to do

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:29.640
something. Then I heard some noise and I realized that he was being beaten.

00:19:31.559 --> 00:19:35.720
My husband Felix and I were on our way back from the shopping mall to the car park.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:41.799
A jeep with tinted windows blocked our path and people with weapons jumped out shouting,

00:19:42.359 --> 00:19:46.440
on the ground, don't move. We were thrown against the vehicle.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:51.799
Felix was sent to a pretrial detention facility where he spent a year.

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:59.750
From the very first bang on the door, I began praying to Jehovah for wisdom,

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:05.029
calmness and for Holy Spirit so that I could make the right decisions and act in the right way.

00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:11.750
And for the whole day I was praying. Jehovah answered all my prayers and I felt that he was close

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:21.690
at my side. Before each court hearing when I was very afraid and felt overwhelmed by emotion and

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:25.849
couldn't calm myself down, it was prayer that helped me to settle down.

00:20:29.339 --> 00:20:34.940
When they took us for interrogation, I started panicking and at that moment I realized that

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:41.259
I needed to meditate on something positive. So I thought, I need to sing our songs.

00:20:41.259 --> 00:20:45.420
And just one song came into my mind, he will make you strong.

00:20:46.779 --> 00:20:51.980
It really strengthened me. Those words about how a Jehovah gave his son for us,

00:20:51.980 --> 00:21:00.900
shows he loves us and will never leave us. Brothers and sisters pray and tell me that they are

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:12.549
praying for me. It gives me the feeling that I am part of a large family. After the interrogation

00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:19.589
he was sent home. My husband and I continued to stick to our spiritual routine. We continued to

00:21:19.589 --> 00:21:26.950
conduct family worship and we are always in the ministry. Our brothers and sisters constantly

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:33.670
support us. They write kind words, they commend us, they send us encouraging scriptures from the

00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:43.559
Bible. In September 2019 Felix was found guilty and sentenced to three years in a general regime

00:21:43.559 --> 00:21:51.180
colony. When he and the other brothers arrived there they were beaten up by officers from the colony.

00:21:53.980 --> 00:22:01.579
Felix told me that he prayed while he was being beaten and he noticed that at that moment he

00:22:01.579 --> 00:22:11.140
stopped feeling the pain. While he is behind bars Felix tries to conduct family worship with me

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:18.980
by letters. He picks certain themes and some specific questions. Then I do research in the

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:28.119
publications and send back what I find. The scripture at Isaiah 30 really strengthens me

00:22:28.119 --> 00:22:36.200
where it says that your strength will be in keeping calm and showing trust. Although I tend to worry

00:22:37.079 --> 00:22:46.660
I understood that calmness is expressed by fully trusting in Jehovah. I have become stronger

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:52.740
because thanks to Jehovah in a way I have developed almost a shell against the difficulties that

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:59.619
used to scare me. That confidence and faith help me. Jehovah was with me and he will remain

00:22:59.619 --> 00:23:06.900
close by me and we will be made stronger thanks to him and we will get through these trials.

00:23:10.579 --> 00:23:19.779
How can we develop courage like our brothers and sisters in Russia? Well we must be convinced

00:23:19.779 --> 00:23:27.220
that the prophecy in the Bible are trustworthy. That was a topic discussed by brother David's

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:35.640
plane of the governing body in the following morning worship program. Now if you just take a look at

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:48.680
today's text it says come and witness the activities of Jehovah, witness. Now according to

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:57.000
a dictionary a witness is someone who has personal knowledge of something. So how can we be witnesses

00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:07.240
of Jehovah? What personal knowledge do we have of his activities? Well first of all we can

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:13.240
testify to the fact that Jehovah can see into the future and when he does that he is right 100%

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:20.680
of the time. And second we know that no one can prevent what Jehovah foresees from coming true.

00:24:21.559 --> 00:24:29.240
All of Jehovah's prophecies come true. Now to illustrate the first point that Jehovah can see

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:37.079
into the future let's consider two remarkable prophecies concerning the destruction of Jerusalem

00:24:37.079 --> 00:24:43.640
and its temple. Now we know that through the prophet Jeremiah Jehovah foretold that

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:49.960
Jerusalem in the temple would be destroyed by the Babylonians. Did it come true? Absolutely

00:24:50.759 --> 00:25:00.440
in 607 BCE but Jehovah went further. He said that Jerusalem would be rebuilt. They will rebuild

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:07.480
the ancient ruins. They will raise up the desolated places of the past and they will restore

00:25:07.559 --> 00:25:16.200
the devastated cities and true worship would also be restored. So that was quite a level of knowledge

00:25:17.319 --> 00:25:24.519
but there's more. Jehovah went further. Jehovah also indicated that the spiritual revival

00:25:24.519 --> 00:25:31.640
wouldn't last. Now that is remarkable and it's implied by what we read in the second part of

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:37.559
Daniel chapter 9 and verse 26. I'd like you to have a look at this. We're going to be

00:25:38.599 --> 00:25:47.640
reading two parts of this verse and it's quite interesting. Daniel chapter 9 and verse 26.

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:56.920
So now what's our objective here it's to see that Jerusalem and its temple would be

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:04.119
we would be destroyed a second time and the true worship would not last. It says in the second

00:26:04.119 --> 00:26:15.319
part of verse 26 and the people of a leader who is coming will destroy the city and the holy place.

00:26:16.359 --> 00:26:22.839
Now when these words were written Jerusalem and the temple were already in ruins but Jehovah

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:29.799
doesn't say Nebuchadnezzar has destroyed the city and its temple. He says the people of a leader

00:26:29.799 --> 00:26:38.680
who is coming the Roman general Titus in 70 CE will destroy the city and the holy place. In order

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:45.559
for that prophecy to be fulfilled Jerusalem and the temple would have to be rebuilt and then

00:26:45.559 --> 00:26:53.160
destroyed a second time. Now that is quite a level of knowledge, quite a level of information

00:26:53.160 --> 00:27:00.680
but what would make this necessary? Why when the Jews came back to their to the promised land

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:08.119
and they were intent on restoring true worship why would this fail and why would Jerusalem and

00:27:08.119 --> 00:27:14.039
the temple be destroyed a second time? Part of it is due to what we find in the first part of

00:27:14.039 --> 00:27:29.210
verse 26. Messiah will be cut off so Jehovah foretold foresaw that when the Messiah came the Jews

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:36.329
would reject him he would be cut off and because of that partly because of that Jerusalem

00:27:37.049 --> 00:27:44.890
and the temple would be destroyed as it happens in 70 CE. Now wait a minute. Wait a minute let's

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:52.009
think about that a minute. The Messiah comes first and Jerusalem and the temple are destroyed

00:27:52.650 --> 00:28:02.329
after that in 70 CE. What does that mean? It means that the Messiah comes before 70 CE so we

00:28:02.329 --> 00:28:10.809
might ask our Jewish friends why are you still waiting for the Messiah? 70 CE has come and gone.

00:28:11.769 --> 00:28:18.490
Well the Messiah came and he too proved to be a true prophet and a remarkable prophecy of Jesus

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:24.650
is found in the Sermon on the Mount. Let's have a look at it and consider the implications of this

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:37.940
prophecy. This is Matthew chapter 7 and we'll read verses 22 and 23 an amazing prophecy. Now

00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:47.559
imagine at this point Jesus teachings have not spread beyond Israel but notice verses 22 and 23.

00:28:48.759 --> 00:28:56.359
Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord did we not prophesy in your name and expel demons in

00:28:56.359 --> 00:29:03.319
your name and perform many powerful works in your name and then I will declare to them I never knew

00:29:04.039 --> 00:29:11.640
you get away from me you workers of lawlessness. Now it's not amazing if Jesus had simply predicted

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:15.559
that his teachings would spread throughout the earth you might say well there's nothing remarkable

00:29:15.559 --> 00:29:23.799
about that but Jesus is saying something different. Jesus is for telling a great apostasy from

00:29:23.799 --> 00:29:31.960
his teachings. Jesus is for telling the birth of Christendom 300 years before the event.

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:41.480
So Jesus foresees that many are going to turn away from the truth and by the end of the first

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:48.920
century that apostasy was already at work wasn't it? There were sects, the sect of Nikolayus for

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:56.920
example and other sects and now they're on the cusp of the great darkness, the great apostasy

00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:02.759
that's going to set in from the second century on and with this in mind what does Jehovah do?

00:30:04.789 --> 00:30:15.029
He makes an amazing statement. Revelation 14, 144,000 will be on Mount Zion with the lamb.

00:30:16.069 --> 00:30:21.910
There were nowhere near 144,000 in the truth in the first century and here Jehovah is saying

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:28.710
there are going to be 144,000 in heaven with the lamb at the end but not only that he goes further.

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:34.470
There's going to be a great crowd that no man can number. How could that ever come true?

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:44.069
ours is the God of true prophecy. Well that's prophecy. What about the second point? That is

00:30:44.069 --> 00:30:49.750
that no one can prevent prophecy from being fulfilled. The devil would love to prevent that

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:56.549
from taking place. Think about Revelation 14. If the devil could make the number one short of

00:30:56.549 --> 00:31:05.349
144,000, he'd be happy because he would show that Jehovah was inaccurate in what he foretold and

00:31:05.349 --> 00:31:11.269
so that's one of the reasons why the devil has made war on the remnant of the seed of the woman.

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:20.230
If it all possible to prevent that number of 144,000 from coming to pass but of course he's going

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:27.029
to fail. And what about the prophecy in the Bible that America and Britain would become a

00:31:27.029 --> 00:31:33.109
dual world power? Now Britain wouldn't become a world power at all if France had anything to say

00:31:33.109 --> 00:31:41.109
about it. France and Britain were sworn enemies and for many many years France was much richer

00:31:41.109 --> 00:31:49.829
and much more powerful than Britain was. And finally at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, France had

00:31:49.829 --> 00:31:57.910
one last chance to prevent Britain from becoming a world power. And France should have won that battle.

00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:06.230
Everything was stacked against the British but there was a driving rain, a fatal miscalculation

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:12.549
on the part of Napoleon and a few other factors that foiled their attempt. And Britain did become

00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:19.430
a world power. And at the end of the 19th century it's quite true that the sun never set on the

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:26.470
British Empire. But now America and Britain were supposed to become a dual world power.

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:32.549
And Britain wasn't the least bit interested in sharing its power with America. It tried to

00:32:32.549 --> 00:32:40.150
prevent America from separating as a colony. There was a long war and there were mistakes made

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:46.309
on both sides. But finally America gained its independence from Britain. And what do we find

00:32:46.309 --> 00:32:54.950
some years after that? Britain is sharing its power with America. They are a dual world power.

00:32:56.309 --> 00:33:05.269
Fighters against God will never prevail. We serve the God of true prophecy and what he foretells

00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:17.140
comes to be. As we've discussed, each detail of the prophecy recorded at Daniel 11 has come true

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:24.900
so far. We must have confidence that the remaining events described in that prophecy will also come

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:33.460
true. We are living in the last days of the time of the end. Soon the nations will fulfill the

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:43.700
prophecy at 1 Thessalonians 5-3. Whenever it is that they are saying peace and security then

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:50.259
sudden destruction is to be instantly on them just like birth pains on a pregnant woman

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:59.940
and they will by no means escape. Then sudden destruction comes upon all parts of Satan's system.

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:09.380
As you can see on the screen, Daniel 121 says, during that time, Michael will stand up,

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:16.340
the great prince who is standing in behalf of your people. And there will occur a time of distress

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:24.260
such as has not occurred since there came to be a nation until that time. And during that time,

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:29.460
your people will escape. Everyone who is found written down in the book.

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:38.420
That leads us into our third point. How should knowing the information that we have just

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:46.179
discussed affect the decisions that we make? Well, what we have reviewed is not just interesting

00:34:46.179 --> 00:34:54.500
history, it's a dramatic prelude to what will soon happen here on earth. Jehovah has given his

00:34:54.500 --> 00:35:00.579
people this knowledge so that we can act on it, it should influence the choices we make.

00:35:01.219 --> 00:35:08.980
In the following dramatization, notice how one young brother makes decisions based on his

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:20.059
understanding of Daniel's prophecy. That was my best friend, Lucas, when we were kids. And that was

00:35:20.059 --> 00:35:29.500
me, Oscar. We knew exactly what we wanted to do when we grew up. Pioneer, go to Bethel,

00:35:30.219 --> 00:35:38.059
build Kingdom Halls. We kept those goals. And when graduation came, we were ready.

00:35:44.389 --> 00:35:50.710
Our little business needed just a few more accounts. Then we'd have enough for us and to help

00:35:50.710 --> 00:36:06.380
our families. Finally, day one for the service year. And two new pioneers, where we live.

00:36:06.699 --> 00:36:27.099
Please don't call me ever again. Finding spiritual interest is tough. We really have cleaners.

00:36:27.099 --> 00:36:35.300
And finding enough work was harder than we thought. A few months in, I was sure Jehovah would help

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:42.179
if we just stuck it out. Sorry, Oscar, I can't make it today. Something came up, Lucas.

00:36:45.619 --> 00:36:57.420
What came up was an opportunity for more money. But at what cost? You quit in or what?

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:03.260
Nah, I'm not quitting. Pioneering or a business?

00:37:05.559 --> 00:37:10.280
Neither, but you know the struggle here. Most brothers can afford to pioneer for a year, two

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:52.900
tops. Look, it's not full-time while I'm training. It's a backup plan. So Lucas stop pioneering.

00:37:59.559 --> 00:38:12.570
Maybe he's right. He's just being practical. I mean, is it wrong to quit if you think it's not

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:21.699
working? I struggled with the same question when I pioneered. Whatever you decide,

00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:30.389
if you can tell Jehovah your reason, with a clean conscience, then it's the right decision for you.

00:38:32.309 --> 00:38:42.739
Why would I keep going when it's so difficult? Since all these things are to be dissolved in this way,

00:38:42.739 --> 00:38:48.420
consider what sorts of people you want to be in holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion.

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:15.190
Really is the last days. And people need the good news. And they'll only hear it if we keep

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:26.780
up our deeds of godly devotion as best we can. I prayed to endure and only stop pioneering if my

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:42.260
circumstances left no other choice. And I prayed to see the blessings. And after a while,

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:59.159
I learned that a little perseverance with Jehovah's spirit can be contagious. So what do you

00:39:59.159 --> 00:40:06.039
want to do when you go up? Pioneer? And go to Bethel? Yep. And then maybe build Kingdom Halls.

00:40:06.039 --> 00:40:20.889
You in? Yeah. That young brother was trying to figure out what to do with his life.

00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:26.889
He made a good decision because he allowed Bible prophecy to influence his thinking.

00:40:27.849 --> 00:40:35.849
We know that teens everywhere face many challenges and we feel for you. Of course, I was once a teenager,

00:40:35.849 --> 00:40:42.969
but I can't even imagine some of the situations that you find yourselves in. But the governing body

00:40:42.969 --> 00:40:51.610
loves you and we want to help. So I'm very happy to announce a new series, My Teen Life.

00:40:52.409 --> 00:40:58.409
You'll hear from witnesses who share the challenges they faced in their teens and how they

00:40:58.409 --> 00:41:07.130
overcame them with Jehovah's help. The interview's are candid, the issues real. Here's the first episode.

00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:22.760
As a teenager, I didn't see any benefit in talking to my parents because they like different things

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:31.159
than I like. So I thought what was the point and I also wanted to be an adult. I wanted to feel

00:41:31.159 --> 00:41:36.039
like an adult and be treated like an adult. I remember when my mom used to pick me up from school,

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:41.159
she wanted to show personal interest at me. So she asked me, oh, how are your friends doing

00:41:41.159 --> 00:41:46.199
how was school today? Do you have a lot of homework? But I just thought that she was being nosy.

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:52.199
I always had my earphones on and whenever my parents were trying to talk to me,

00:41:52.199 --> 00:41:55.880
that was my chance to just pop them in and ignore them.

00:41:57.079 --> 00:42:01.880
The way my parents grew up wasn't the same way that I grew up. They grew up in a different country,

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:07.639
they spoke a different language, they grew up in a different time. When you're talking to

00:42:07.639 --> 00:42:13.400
somebody who doesn't speak your language natively, oftentimes you won't be able to explain things

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:18.440
from your heart. And so I had that challenge. I wasn't able to talk directly to my parents' heart

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:25.400
and so there was always this frustration in trying to really convey how I felt and I felt

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:29.480
like it wasn't really getting through to my parents. When I went to my first pioneer school,

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:35.079
I learned a lot about Jehovah's qualities and one of them was how he was a very approachable person.

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:41.480
And I thought to myself, am I approachable person? And I thought about how I acted in the

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:48.280
ministry and then in the meetings and then at home. And I realized at home I had a lot of things

00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:54.199
I needed to fix. I felt like it was two different worlds. I was living in. One was when I was at school

00:42:54.199 --> 00:43:00.519
with my peers, I felt like I was understood. And at home, I kind of just withdrew to myself.

00:43:00.519 --> 00:43:05.000
I wouldn't try to communicate with them because it didn't seem worth the effort. I tried to figure

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:15.190
out problems in my own way. It was kind of a trial and error. I developed a lot of bad habits

00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:20.630
that today I'm still trying to overcome. If I was able to communicate with them more,

00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:25.829
if I was able to connect with them and ask for their help and get their support and have them

00:43:25.829 --> 00:43:30.309
on my team, things would have went a lot better. And I really wish I did.

00:43:31.269 --> 00:43:37.510
Jesus, who was a perfect human being and who had perfect judgment, didn't make decisions on his own.

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:42.869
He always looked for his father for guidance. And that got me thinking, well, if Jesus did that,

00:43:42.869 --> 00:43:47.829
it has to be something good in it for me too. What really helped me was Colossians 4-6.

00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:54.389
I knew I needed to speak more gracious in the family. And I realized that I was speaking

00:43:54.389 --> 00:44:00.309
very defensively. And I needed to be more approachable to my parents. When I first tried to talk

00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:05.670
with them, of course, it was awkward. And I didn't want to talk about anything personal because I was

00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:11.349
in use to it. So I thought I could maybe ask them about them, ask them how their day was,

00:44:11.989 --> 00:44:16.630
and what they like from meetings. So I just try to show more interest in them instead of focusing

00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:21.349
on myself. And I think that's what got the conversation going and got me comfortable to really

00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:28.789
talk with them. I was so focused on how my parents weren't understanding me that I wasn't really

00:44:28.789 --> 00:44:35.429
trying to understand them. When I thought about my parents, I thought about how much work it takes

00:44:35.429 --> 00:44:41.429
to be a parent. From when I was a baby, for many years, they were working day and night to try to

00:44:41.429 --> 00:44:47.829
care for me. They never demanded a thank you or anything for me. They were really self-sacrificing.

00:44:48.389 --> 00:44:54.710
And I imagined if I had to work that much for somebody, how would I feel if they didn't

00:44:55.590 --> 00:45:01.989
really say thank you? Or how would I feel if this person who I worked so hard for didn't really

00:45:01.989 --> 00:45:08.469
view me as their friend? Later on as I got older and started that communication going with my

00:45:08.469 --> 00:45:15.030
parents, I realized taking their advice and really listening to their opinions and always letting

00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:22.550
them know what I'm going to do and where I'm going to go was a mature thing to do. Our heart oftentimes

00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:29.829
takes the driver's seat and it directs us to where it thinks it should go. And oftentimes it goes

00:45:29.829 --> 00:45:35.510
in the wrong direction and we sometimes get hurt, then we look back and say I wish I didn't do that.

00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:43.429
And our parents have been there. What they're trying to do for us now is to tell us, don't let your

00:45:43.429 --> 00:45:49.670
heart take the driver's seat. If I can talk to my teenage self, I would tell myself to see my mom

00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:55.510
and dad more like coaches because I used to think they were always trying to criticize me and

00:45:55.510 --> 00:46:02.389
point out my faults but really they're just trying to help me and they want me to have a happy life.

00:46:02.389 --> 00:46:06.789
I really wish I knew that as a teenager but I'm glad I learned that now.

00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:32.360
We hope that you'll enjoy and benefit from future episodes of My Teen Life.

00:46:33.239 --> 00:46:39.880
This new series is another way the governing body prepares Jehovah's people to cope with today's

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:48.519
challenges and to be ready for what's coming. Bible prophecy shows that in the near future the

00:46:48.519 --> 00:46:56.440
nations will turn on all false religions and wipe them out. Then they will launch a final attack

00:46:56.440 --> 00:47:03.800
on God's people and what a mistake that will be as discussed in the pure worship book.

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:09.800
Jehovah will respond to that attack by unleashing his rage on the nations.

00:47:11.079 --> 00:47:17.239
After the dust of Armageddon settles, those with the earthly hope can look forward to a thousand

00:47:17.239 --> 00:47:23.480
years of genuine peace and security working under the rule of God's kingdom.

00:47:24.679 --> 00:47:31.400
Before that time comes, we will continue to face trials and opposition but we can endure.

00:47:32.199 --> 00:47:36.519
We have many modern day examples that we can imitate right now.

00:47:37.559 --> 00:47:45.639
Those examples can help all of us to be prepared to stand firm and to remain fully united in the

00:47:45.639 --> 00:47:54.920
faith. This month's original song entitled One United People encourages us to do just that.

00:47:55.400 --> 00:52:26.760
We have seen my speed is no stranger of this year's convention is

00:52:28.039 --> 00:52:37.400
powerful by faith. We will learn what faith is, why it is essential and how we acquire it.

00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:48.250
Here is a preview. It can be hard to put faith in something you cannot see but real faith is not

00:52:48.250 --> 00:53:04.550
blind. Real faith is based on facts, on realities, on truth. It gives us courage and strength

00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:18.170
and it helps us to endure. When life gets hard, it provides peace. It reminds us of our purpose

00:53:20.489 --> 00:53:28.539
and it brings us real joy. Learn how to build and strengthen your faith at the 2021

00:53:28.539 --> 00:53:50.260
powerful by faith convention of Jehovah's Witnesses. Now it's time for our video postcard

00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:59.909
which comes to us from our brothers and sisters in Belarus. Belarus is an eastern European nation

00:53:59.909 --> 00:54:08.710
that borders Russia. It's known as the blue-eyed country because it is dotted with more than

00:54:08.789 --> 00:54:18.630
10,000 lakes. Some of Europe's most ancient trees as well as its largest mammal the European

00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:27.030
bison can be found here. Castles, updating from the 16th century, are popular sites.

00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:36.340
This is Nesvi's castle. If you look up at the ceiling of its chapel, you'll see Jehovah's name

00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:43.780
in the form of the tetragramaton. When Belarus was part of the Soviet Union,

00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:51.699
Jehovah's Witnesses faced strong government opposition. Some of our brothers were exiled to far

00:54:51.699 --> 00:55:02.739
away Siberia. Today, more than 6,000 publishers in 84 congregations boldly declared the good news

00:55:02.739 --> 00:55:11.380
in Belarus. There is a zealous by a new spirit here. 20% of the publishers are in full-time

00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:19.219
service. This is how our brothers share the good news in the city of Breast. They enjoy

00:55:19.219 --> 00:55:27.909
many aspects of public witnessing. Here are our brothers and sisters in the city of Cobrin.

00:55:27.909 --> 00:55:36.230
Their territory includes both urban and rural areas. The 78 publishers here conduct an

00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:47.269
average of 74 Bible studies each month. Our brothers and sisters in Belarus sent you their warm,

00:55:47.269 --> 00:55:55.190
love and greetings. Herman, it's been a pleasure reviewing this exciting material about the king

00:55:55.269 --> 00:56:05.460
of the north with you. Thank you, Ken. This information is so important. It helps all of us to face

00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:14.179
the future with confidence. Before we say goodbye, we have a treat for you. Here's a preview of

00:56:14.179 --> 00:56:39.210
the video drama from this year's convention. Please enjoy. We'll receive training in the house

00:56:39.210 --> 00:56:50.360
of the Great King. Have you could nezor? Wait. Did I do it? He's strong in my son.

00:56:53.639 --> 00:56:57.239
He's the new land with new laws. He's been the one who's to worship their gods.

00:56:58.519 --> 00:57:09.559
Jehovah's in Israel. We're in Babylon now. What's going to happen to us?

00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:19.110
I want to tell him what it is. Everyone's to be executed by dying. We have in some

00:57:19.110 --> 00:57:26.119
morning. But do what? It's Jerusalem. They burned down Jehovah's house.

00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:37.239
As long as Jehovah exists, we have hope. Interpretations belong to my God, Jehovah. He knows your dream

00:57:37.239 --> 00:57:47.880
and what it means. Where is your God? Oh, Jehovah, surely you didn't bring us here to die.

00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:51.480
Please, vindicate yourself.

00:58:27.219 --> 01:02:48.179
And inspired our brothers in Russia in your prayers. Learn from their example of faith and courage.

01:02:49.059 --> 01:02:56.579
See these events for what they are, the fulfillment of Bible prophecy. Let this knowledge

01:02:56.579 --> 01:03:04.739
move you to make wise decisions. Stay faithful and stay busy as the end of this system draws close.

01:03:04.739 --> 01:03:13.059
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is J.W. Broadcasting.
