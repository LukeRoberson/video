00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:10.000
Can you imagine how Adam must have felt when he was introduced to Eve?

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.480
Actually, we don't have to imagine how he felt.

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.359
We know that he was overwhelmed with appreciation.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.679
And he expressed his appreciation in poetic terms that are recorded in the Bible.

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:28.320
You remember the words,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.960
this is at last,

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.359
bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh.

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:41.520
Think about it. Adam and Eve had a perfect marriage.

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:46.880
And together, they formed a perfect family.

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.840
Of course, with their disobedience, all of that changed.

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.399
Instead of perfection, they were confronted with one another's imperfections.

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.039
And in the instant that they separated themselves from Jehovah,

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:11.120
they began to experience stress and anxiety that affected their relationship.

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.640
It is a testimony to Jehovah's love and wisdom

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:26.319
that despite imperfections and despite the stress and anxiety that have only intensified in these last days,

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:35.760
the family can still be a source of joy, a place of security and stability.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.400
But for that to happen,

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:45.439
each member of the family must shoulder his load of scriptural responsibility.

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:53.519
In this symposium, we're going to consider husbands, wives,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:02.159
parents, and children and how each of us can contribute to the joy of the family.

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:07.680
To start, let's address husbands.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.800
If you are a husband, how do you view your wife?

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:19.039
Do you view her as Jehovah does?

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:28.800
Do you view her and feel about her as Adam felt about Eve when he first met her?

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:38.080
In fact, the Bible helps us husbands appreciate that our wives are a gift from Jehovah.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.599
Do you appreciate the gift?

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:46.800
And are you demonstrating your appreciation?

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:55.520
For a few minutes this morning, we're going to consider four ways that we husbands can demonstrate

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:02.479
appreciation for the gift Jehovah has given us. If you're taking notes, here they are.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.879
Number one, it's important that we assign our wives on her.

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:16.159
Number two, we must invest time in our relationship.

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:24.080
Number three, it's important that we confine our romantic interests to our wife.

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:31.439
And number four, we have to be realistic in our expectations.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.680
Let's consider these points one at a time.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:46.349
A turn please in your Bible to first Peter, chapter three, and we're going to read verse seven.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:55.900
You husbands, in the same way, continued dwelling with them according to knowledge.

00:03:57.259 --> 00:04:05.500
Assign them on her as to a weaker vessel, the feminine one, since they are also errors with you

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:12.620
of the undeserved favor of life, in order for your prayers not to be hindered.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.980
Well, Peter leaves us in no doubt as to who are being addressed.

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:30.060
You husbands, that's you and me. He tells us that we must continue dwelling with our wives

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:37.500
according to knowledge. The footnote in our Bible says showing them consideration

00:04:38.459 --> 00:04:47.259
or understanding them. How well do you know your wife? What do you know about her background

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:56.939
her upbringing? You know what makes her happy? Do you know why? You know what's upsetting to her,

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:06.540
what causes anxiety? Do you understand why? See, it's important that we take the time

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:12.459
to get to know our wives because only then can we care for their

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:23.579
physical, emotional, and spiritual needs. And only then can we do what Peter next says in the verse.

00:05:23.579 --> 00:05:31.500
And here's our main point. Assign them on her. Assign your wife on her.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:41.740
And then Peter says as to a weaker vessel. Now, what does Peter mean when he refers to the wife

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:50.300
as a weaker vessel? Do you think he's betraying some chauvinistic leaning? No,

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:59.819
because he's already said, Assign her on her. We could illustrate it this way. Imagine that you

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:09.980
have two bowls, exactly the same sawas, exactly the same capacity. But one is made of wood,

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:18.699
and the other is made of very fine, very expensive porcelain. Both bowls

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:29.420
both with the same capacity. But would you handle both in the same way? No. See,

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:39.100
you recognize that the porcelain is more valuable and more fragile. So you handle it in a different way.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:47.660
And that's what Peter is telling us about our wives. She is the weaker vessel, the feminine one.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:56.139
And what way is she weaker? Certainly not intellectually. And certainly not spiritually.

00:06:57.339 --> 00:07:07.379
Primarily, in a physical sense, we husbands have an advantage. So we accord our wife on her.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:14.259
That means we would never get physical with her. And certainly we would never

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:24.980
her on a pretext pretend to honor her in public and then abuse her in some way in private.

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:34.180
See, that would never work, would it? No, we assign her honor at all times.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:43.139
And here's why. Peter says, they are also heirs with you of the undeserved favor of life.

00:07:44.819 --> 00:07:52.420
Husbands and wives are on equal footing before Jehovah in a spiritual sense. Both husbands and

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:59.699
wives must wash their robes and make them white in the blood of the Lamb. Jesus did not die more for

00:07:59.699 --> 00:08:09.459
husbands than he did for wives. And both husbands and wives have the hope of everlasting life.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:21.459
So we remember that if we don't, how does Peter conclude? In order for your prayers not to be hindered.

00:08:22.339 --> 00:08:32.960
The point, our dealings with our wife will have a direct impact on our personal relationship with

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:43.120
Jehovah. So assign her on her, value what she does for you and for your family and demonstrate your

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:54.799
appreciation. Our second point, invest time in your relationship. It's so easy, isn't it? For

00:08:54.799 --> 00:09:02.879
secular work, theocratic assignments and association with others to rob us a valuable time that should

00:09:02.879 --> 00:09:11.840
be spent with our wives. Interestingly, when we were getting to know one another,

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:19.600
courting, we were anxious for one-on-one time. That shouldn't change when we got married.

00:09:20.799 --> 00:09:31.200
So buy out the time, set it aside, and stick to it. In that way, you demonstrate your appreciation

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:39.440
for the gift Jehovah has given you. Our third point is highlighted in Proverbs chapter 5.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:45.679
So turn there with me, please. Proverbs chapter 5 and we'll begin reading in verse 18.

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:59.009
May your own fountain be blessed. And here's the point. And may you rejoice with the wife of your youth.

00:09:59.649 --> 00:10:09.490
A loving doe, a graceful mountain goat, let her breasts satisfy you at all times. And then here

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:20.830
again is the point. May you be captivated by her love constantly. What is the point? We must

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:31.549
confine our romantic interests to our wife. There's no other option. We want to rejoice with the wife

00:10:31.549 --> 00:10:40.269
of our youth. We want to be captivated by her love. That means avoiding overly close relationships

00:10:40.269 --> 00:10:50.190
with other women. And not just physical relationships, texting, video conferencing, telephone calls,

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:58.110
all constitute a relationship. So we're very careful. We set limits and we don't go beyond them.

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:08.190
And confining our romantic interests to our wife includes rejecting sexual fantasies involving

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:16.350
others. The world makes light of such fantasizing. But Jesus helped us to appreciate

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:22.750
it's a very serious matter. Do you recall his words in the sermon on the mount?

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:32.590
Anyone who keeps on looking at a woman so as to have a passion for her has already committed

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:43.710
adultery in his heart. The point, fantasizing is little more than rehearsing. So we reject such fantasies

00:11:43.789 --> 00:11:52.110
knowing that they violate Bible counsel, including Jesus' very pointed advice. And they can prevent us

00:11:52.110 --> 00:12:02.350
from rejoicing in our wife. Finally, number four. Be realistic in your expectations.

00:12:03.629 --> 00:12:12.509
We husbands are not perfect. We know that. Our wives are not perfect. Don't you appreciate it when

00:12:12.509 --> 00:12:21.470
your wife smooths over your imperfection and makes you look good? Well, our wives appreciate it when

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:31.629
we do that for them. So be alert for opportunities to do that. In the following dramatization, notice how

00:12:31.629 --> 00:12:40.269
the husband rejoices in his wife. I was trying to get caught up on paperwork for the circuit

00:12:40.269 --> 00:12:57.120
overseas visit. There was so much to do. You got to be kidding me. Well, you're home early, honey.

00:13:00.269 --> 00:13:05.870
I said something was wrong. The kids had left a few things out and I was a bit preoccupied.

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:15.009
The tough day? You were supposed to talk to the girls about this. They're making it a habit.

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:34.110
The more I thought about it though, I realized it wasn't just a kitchen. I guess I was part of the problem.

00:13:34.509 --> 00:14:02.419
Or maybe the problem was me. You see, my wife is an amazing woman. I'm so loving. It would be an

00:14:02.419 --> 00:14:20.899
understatement to call her industrious. And then there's her infectious joy. I mean, how could I not love

00:14:20.899 --> 00:14:33.200
her? But sometimes it takes more than saying I love you. You know, honey, you're right. This is

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:37.919
completely unacceptable. I'll talk to the girls as soon as they come through that door.

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:50.320
Thank you. I love you. I love you too. Did you notice how the husband in the video rejoiced in his wife?

00:14:51.759 --> 00:15:01.200
He reflected on her many good works. Her devotion to Jehovah, the good act that she performed for

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:09.360
others, her fine work in behalf of her family, her spontaneous joy that made her even more beautiful

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:18.080
to him. And as he reflected on all of those fine things, what happened? His appreciation for his

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:27.919
gift, deepened, and he was motivated to do something about it. That's a beautiful example for us.

00:15:28.879 --> 00:15:37.200
So, rejoice in your wife by assigning her honor, by investing time in your relationship,

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:45.759
by confining your romantic interests to your wife, and by being realistic in your expectations.

00:15:45.759 --> 00:15:52.320
If you do, your marriage and your family will continue to be a source of joy,

00:15:52.720 --> 00:16:01.120
a place of stability, and a place of security. Brother Patrick LaFranca, a helper to the

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:06.559
personnel committee of the governing body, will now present the next talk of the symposium.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:13.120
Cultivate joy in your family. Wives, rejoice in your husband.
