00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:14.779
One of the first laws of New Russia, it was a law from 18th of October, 1991, about the rehabilitation of the victims of political repressions.

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:24.780
Under the rehabilitation, those who were under the influence of the Supreme Court were convicted.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:33.780
This was in 1991. What changed during this time? Did you see any evidence? No.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.780
What changed during this time in our state?

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:50.780
How can we explain this unthinkable, soft speech of the court of the Ministry of Justice, which was released today from this,

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.780
from the co-elections of the Supreme Court of Justice?

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.780
Who are the consequences?

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.780
If this ISC will be the territory of the head of the Kodus,

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.780
established in accordance with the participation in the activities

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.780
of the protection of the Kyrgyzstan or the organization of this activity.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.780
In general, we have such a healthy Sans,

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.780
as, by the way, the participation of one to one to six

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.780
for the organization, from six to ten years of freedom.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.780
We have not lived under these controlled, controlled

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.780
or controlled organizations,

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.780
which are standing behind these masks.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.780
We have no analytics, no experts.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.780
We have not lived any of those who have already told us

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.780
what to do tomorrow.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.780
We have done the first steps.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.780
The last steps have already been done.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.780
If today was forbidden,

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.780
the number of people who have to be here should be the head of the Kyrgyzstan.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.780
Some of you are going to comment on this in a few minutes

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.780
about the respective conditions of the Kvashimorgliliznogdiny.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.780
They say, yes, yes, they did.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.780
They said, they are going to do something,

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.780
because, because of these criminal punishments,

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.780
I am saying that this is going to be simply inevitable.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.780
It has already been approved.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.780
In 2015, in Togonroya.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.780
When they came to the local community,

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.780
they made an appeal to the film.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.780
They fixed the facts of the gathering.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.780
They made a lot of money.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.780
At the end of the year, they went to the pre-war.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:54.780
It was a waste, a waste of freedom, but it was a very dangerous thing.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.780
There was such an attempt to say the right stone.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.780
And now what?

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.780
Now it's not that simple. It's not a separate community.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.780
And it's because of all Russia, so what?

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.780
Because all Russia, today, will be in court.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.780
They are inevitable.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.780
But today there is still time.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.780
Just think about it.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.780
There will be a little less than two weeks.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.780
Think about it and leave it.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.780
And probably it will be more likely to be made a step back.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.780
Because look at the fact that it may not be said.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.780
Many now think that the list is not clear.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.780
It will not be explained to us.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.780
I think it's not worth it at all.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.780
Again, just look at the German history.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:52.780
In the history of the past, they have always been the beginning of the Soviet Union.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.780
And I think it's a pity for everyone.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.780
I can also say, take the Soviet Union.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.780
This is all taken against the rest.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:12.780
And this is what I began with the recognition of the victims of the political press.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.780
And even in the 19th century,

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.779
the same thing has been seen as a result of the establishment

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:23.779
of such beautiful books,

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:27.779
that this is such a recognition of the victims of the political press.

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:31.779
And according to this establishment,

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:33.779
it is assumed to be taken into account.

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:35.779
And what about today?

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:39.779
Maybe they will come back

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:42.779
and have a legal obligation to change it.

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:47.779
Or just the citizens to collect all these achievements

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:50.779
and to take them back.

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:55.779
I really want to believe that all this is a serious matter.

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:58.779
And they really enjoy it.
