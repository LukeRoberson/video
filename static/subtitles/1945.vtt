00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:17.489
Many people regard Jesus as the most influential person in history, but is he

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:26.980
Almighty God himself? Or was he simply a good man? Many people personally met

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.219
Jesus and some of their accounts are found in the Bible, revealing who Jesus

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:39.740
really is. For instance, an angel spoke to Jesus mother about her unborn son

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:51.479
and said, this one will be great and will be called son of the most high. When

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:58.439
Jesus was being baptized, God's own voice confirmed Jesus' identity. This is my

00:00:58.439 --> 00:01:08.870
son, the beloved whom I have approved. What did his followers believe? When

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:16.790
Jesus asked who they thought he was, Peter responded. You are the Christ, the

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:26.060
son of the living God. What did Jesus' enemies say? Those wanting to kill him

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.859
explained why. According to the law, he ought to die because he made himself God's

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:43.359
son. What did Jesus himself say about his identity and relationship to God? He

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:54.000
told his followers, the father is greater than I am. Even after his death and

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.379
resurrection, Jesus said this about his future. I am ascending to my father and

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:12.849
your father and to my God and your God. The biblical record makes it clear that

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:21.449
Jesus is a distinct person separate from God Almighty. In fact, the Bible teaches

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:27.250
that although Jesus is a powerful spirit creature in heaven, he is still subject

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:35.090
to his God and father. Still, God has given a special assignment to his son to

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.449
bring everlasting life and happiness to all humankind just as God originally

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:49.909
purposed. What else does the Bible say about Jesus? Did Jesus really perform

00:02:49.909 --> 00:03:01.860
miracles? Why did Jesus die? Will Jesus return? To learn more, search for these
