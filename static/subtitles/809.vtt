00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.580
We live in a time of judgment.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.580
We're not talking about flawed human judgment.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:14.179
We're talking about the perfect judgment that comes from the heavenly kingdom in Jesus' hands.

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:22.679
Jesus spoke of this judgment in his great prophecy about the last days found in Matthew chapter 24 and 25.

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:30.379
After outlining what we could expect to see, he provided three parables that deal with final judgment.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:38.579
In Matthew chapter 25, the first two parables relate to the final ceiling of genuine anointed ones.

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.079
These parables will be fulfilled not long before the great tribulation begins.

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:50.179
Next, in the third parable, Jesus gives attention to the rest of mankind.

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:57.399
Let's read the opening four verses of what he said, starting in verse 31.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:05.299
When the Son of Man comes in his glory and all the angels with him, then he will sit down on his glory his throne.

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:15.299
All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate people one from another just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.400
And he will put the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.799
Then the king will say to those on his right,

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:33.099
come, you who have been blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the founding of the world.

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:35.299
Inherit the kingdom.

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.099
In other words, paradise, the earthly realm of the kingdom.

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:42.000
When is this fulfilled?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.400
After Jesus comes in his glory, he said, and judges those then living.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:02:00.099
Jesus said that this judgment would result in a figurative separating of people to his right hand and to his left hand, like separating sheep from goats.

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:03.900
Jesus calls those at his right hand righteous.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:12.099
However, he calls those separated to his left hand, cursed, and he sends them off into everlasting destruction.

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:21.800
Since the first two parables involve judgment that takes place before the Great Tribulation, what about this third parable?

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:28.800
When does Jesus start to identify the righteous sheep and the cursed goats?

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:36.800
Back in 1995, the Watchtower helped us to understand that the final judgment of the sheep and the goats will be decided

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.400
when Jesus comes in his glory during the Great Tribulation.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.199
Does this mean that the judgment process does not start until then?

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:48.300
The answer is no.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.900
Why can we say this?

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.500
Well, let's illustrate the point.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.000
Think about judgments delivered by a supreme court.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.400
When the day arrives for a judgment to be announced, does this mean that only then the court starts to consider the evidence at hand?

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.400
No.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.199
By that time, the court has already read briefs.

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:15.500
They have prepared and heard oral arguments, and then they consider the legal background to the case.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.900
This may take considerable time.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:26.500
No court opinion is considered final until it is delivered an open court or released to the public.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.000
What is the point?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.800
Well, if the supreme courts of human governments take time to hear all the facts

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:42.000
and to weigh all the circumstances, should we be surprised that Jesus is wisely using his time now to judge people fairly?

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.199
By the start of the Great Tribulation, Jesus will know who is goat-like and who is sheep-like.

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:49.599
How so?

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.000
Well, consider this.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.900
To a degree even we can see where people are choosing to stand, true,

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.699
the Bible foretold that this would be the case in Malachi 3.

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:08.500
There we find prophetic words that point ahead to events in the first century and in modern times.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.300
Then verse 18 says that we would quote,

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.599
see the distinction between a righteous person and a wicked person,

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:20.699
between one serving God and one not serving Him.

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:27.199
If we can see the distinction, then we can be certain that Jesus is far ahead of us.

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:29.500
What does Jesus see?

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:37.699
Well, we can be sure that He's carefully watching the attitudes, actions, and speech of each person.

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:42.300
For example, He sees their response to the good news.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:50.800
Also, Jesus is observing whether individuals support His anointed brothers who will serve with Him in the kingdom.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:58.800
At Matthew 25, 35 through 40, Jesus said that His brothers would experience many trials

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:05.500
and He explained that those whom He judges as sheep are the ones who assist His brothers.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:13.300
He also said that He views what is done to them as being done to Him.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.000
While Christ's brothers will undoubtedly face trials during the Great Tribulation,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.800
how are they helped now?

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.000
Doing good to Christ's brothers now includes working along with them as they strive

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.100
to complete the preaching of the good news of the kingdom.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.800
Jesus takes note of this.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.100
What else does Jesus observe?

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.000
At Matthew 12, 36 and 37,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.399
Jesus stated that a person's words would also be a basis for how He or She is judged.

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:54.000
Let's look at what Jesus said at Matthew 12, 36 and 37.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:59.199
Jesus said, I tell you that men will render an account on judgment day

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:02.800
for every unprofitable saying that they speak.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:10.500
For by your words you will be declared righteous and by your words you will be condemned.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.000
So then does Jesus hear what we say?

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.500
Yes, He does, including what we have said in preaching the good news.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:25.000
Now, by using the words render an account here.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.800
Jesus was referring to what a person has said in the past.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:37.199
That thought is reinforced by the use of the past tense in Matthew 25,

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:45.800
Matthew 25, 34 through 40 for the sheep and 41 through 45 for the goats.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.899
For example, in verse 40, Jesus says to the sheep like ones

00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:56.399
to the extent that you did it past tense to one of the least of these my brothers,

00:06:56.399 --> 00:06:59.000
you did it to me.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
What does this tell us?

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.899
It tells us that everyone who desires to be viewed as a righteous sheep

00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:09.800
must build up a good record of support for Christ's brothers now.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.899
A person must be sheep like one entering the Great Tribulation

00:07:13.899 --> 00:07:18.300
and they must remain sheep like to the very end.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.300
By the time the Son of Man comes in his glory,

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:25.899
it will be far too late to build up such a good record with him.

00:07:25.899 --> 00:07:32.300
Jesus is like the king mentioned in Proverbs 20 and verse 8.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.600
There it says,

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.899
When the king sits on the throne to judge,

00:07:36.899 --> 00:07:41.100
he sifts out all evil with his eyes.

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.500
And line with this,

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.500
we can be certain that Jesus, our Heavenly King,

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.500
is already sifting and taking note of who are goat-like

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:53.300
in their attitudes, actions, and speech.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:57.600
For those who continue refusing to serve Jehovah and His Kingdom,

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:02.300
their judgment will be in place as the Great Tribulation begins.

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.899
We can say this because there are no scriptural indications

00:08:05.899 --> 00:08:10.800
of any conversions to pure worship during the Great Tribulation.

00:08:10.899 --> 00:08:15.699
Instead, we read at Revelation 6, 16 and 17,

00:08:15.699 --> 00:08:18.699
that those who chose not to obey the good news

00:08:18.699 --> 00:08:23.699
will at that time turn to man-made things to try to save them.

00:08:23.699 --> 00:08:27.500
They will run to things that they view as mountain-like or strong,

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.199
such as their political and commercial systems.

00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:35.299
Revelation 6, 16 tells us that they will cry out to such things,

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:36.100
saying,

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:41.000
Fall over us and hide us from the face of the ones seated on the throne

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.299
and from the wrath of the Lamb.

00:08:44.299 --> 00:08:49.000
But these human institutions will have no power to save them.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.600
What will this mean for such ones?

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.799
Many goat-like ones will perish early in the Great Tribulation

00:08:55.799 --> 00:09:01.299
when the governments of this world turn on and destroy false religion.

00:09:01.299 --> 00:09:05.100
Many more will perish at the hands of other goat-like people.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:10.399
Ezekiel 38, 21, prophetically states that every man's sword

00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:13.500
will be against his own brother.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.700
Finally, all remaining goat-like ones will perish

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:21.299
by means of the angelic forces at Armageddon.

00:09:21.299 --> 00:09:23.700
But ask for the sheep-like ones.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:27.700
The fine shepherd Jesus will know each one of them

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.799
before the start of the Great Tribulation

00:09:30.799 --> 00:09:33.799
and he will observe their loyalty to Jehovah

00:09:33.899 --> 00:09:36.500
throughout the Great Tribulation.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.899
Then, just before Armageddon begins,

00:09:39.899 --> 00:09:42.500
Jesus will in effect sit down as judged

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:46.500
to make the final distinction between the sheep and the goats

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.000
out of all people then living.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.700
Notably, in this third parable,

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:56.500
Jesus said that those who are at that time judged as goats

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.799
will call him Lord.

00:09:58.799 --> 00:10:03.700
But Jesus will make it clear that they did not support his brothers.

00:10:04.399 --> 00:10:07.899
So then, any persons who were once sheep-like

00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:10.200
but who failed to endure to the end

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.399
by courageously supporting Christ's brothers

00:10:13.399 --> 00:10:16.600
will be placed among the goats.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.200
Referring to Jesus as Lord will not save them.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.100
It will be too late to do good for Christ's brothers

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:28.000
who will likely be with Jesus in the heavenly kingdom by that time.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.600
Of course, the goats will also include those enemies

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:34.799
of God who are still alive out of all the nations.

00:10:34.799 --> 00:10:38.200
This final judging serves an important purpose.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.000
What is it?

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.200
It will leave no doubt in the eyes of all then living

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.000
as to who Jesus' righteous sheep are

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
as they prepare to enter the new world.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.700
So then strive to keep standing among the righteous

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:57.100
who will be placed at Jesus' right hand.

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:00.100
God's word promises that as long as sheep-like ones

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:04.399
remain loyal to Him and to His appointed King Jesus

00:11:04.399 --> 00:11:08.200
they will be guided into everlasting life.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.200
Such ones must display courage

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.899
by supporting the work of Christ's brothers

00:11:12.899 --> 00:11:17.200
both now and during the great tribulation.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.000
What kind of courage will be needed?

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Courage like that of Anna Ciferus.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.200
The Apostle Paul mentions this faithful Christian

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.899
at 2 Timothy 1, 16 through 18.

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:33.200
We invite you to read what he said about him

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.600
starting in verse 16.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:40.700
May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Anna Ciferus

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:43.100
for he often refreshed me

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:46.700
and he did not become ashamed of my prison chains.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.399
On the contrary, when he was in Rome,

00:11:49.399 --> 00:11:52.399
he diligently looked for me and found me.

00:11:52.399 --> 00:11:56.500
May the Lord grant him to find mercy from Jehovah

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.399
in that day.

00:11:59.399 --> 00:12:03.600
Anna Ciferus would have been an anointed Christian

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:08.200
but his example is one for every Christian to imitate.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.899
Just visiting Paul could have cost Anna Ciferus his freedom

00:12:11.899 --> 00:12:13.399
or his life,

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:16.500
but that did not stop him from finding Paul

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.299
and refreshing him, did it.

00:12:19.299 --> 00:12:21.899
Qualities such as Anna Ciferus-like courage

00:12:21.899 --> 00:12:24.700
will be required of all sheep-like ones

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.500
during the Great Tribulation.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:31.700
So in summary, Jesus is now observing the actions,

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:35.200
attitudes and speech of all people.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.899
As a thorough judge,

00:12:36.899 --> 00:12:39.200
he will have identified sheep-like ones

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:43.100
and goat-like ones by the start of the Great Tribulation.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:46.100
Then, according to Jesus' parable,

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.899
just before Armageddon begins,

00:12:48.899 --> 00:12:50.899
Jesus will pass final judgment

00:12:50.899 --> 00:12:53.700
on all then living on earth,

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.399
giving attention to why the righteous sheep

00:12:56.399 --> 00:12:58.700
are placed at his right hand.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:02.600
Will you be found standing among the righteous?

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.899
To receive that blessing,

00:13:03.899 --> 00:13:06.000
don't be swayed by the things you see

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.899
taking place around you in this world.

00:13:08.899 --> 00:13:11.899
Don't be swayed by popular protests.

00:13:11.899 --> 00:13:15.000
Remain neutral, no part of it.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.700
Don't be swayed by political promises.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.899
Remain neutral, no part of it.

00:13:20.899 --> 00:13:24.799
Don't be swayed as governments say peace and security.

00:13:24.799 --> 00:13:27.899
Remain neutral, no part of it.

00:13:27.899 --> 00:13:30.500
But when it comes to obeying God's laws,

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:34.899
stand firmly on the side of the kingdom.

00:13:34.899 --> 00:13:37.500
Only those who remain no part of the world

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.700
will be viewed by Jesus as being sheep-like

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:43.399
when the Great Tribulation begins

00:13:43.399 --> 00:13:46.700
and when it wraps up at Armageddon.

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:50.100
And only those who continue to support Jesus' brothers

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.500
will be placed at Jesus' right hand

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.399
when he makes the final judgment

00:13:54.399 --> 00:13:58.399
of the righteous sheep and the cursed goats.

00:13:58.399 --> 00:14:00.500
Show where you desire to stand

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:03.500
in all that you say and do right now.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.799
And during the time yet remaining,

00:14:05.799 --> 00:14:08.399
get ready to use our new publication,

00:14:08.399 --> 00:14:10.799
Enjoy Life Forever

00:14:10.799 --> 00:14:12.700
and help many more

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:14.899
take a righteous stand

00:14:14.899 --> 00:14:16.899
before the end comes.
