00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:08.439
Sometimes, I really hate my job.

00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:12.439
I don't know how Jason stays so positive.

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:30.670
I asked Jason why he refused the money

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.670
and I found out he's one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.670
My wife is too.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.670
So I know a lot about them.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.670
But what Jason did really surprised me.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.039
I wondered why he didn't feel like he was entitled to the extra money.

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:50.039
He's such a hard worker.

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.039
And most of our supervisors accept bribes.

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:57.039
Jason showed me a Bible verse.

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:00.039
Whatever you are doing, work at a whole soul

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:04.040
that's what Jehovah and not for men.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.040
Jason's relationship with God influences every aspect of his life.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.040
Even his attitude toward work,

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.040
he couldn't participate in something dishonest.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.040
Even if others do.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:44.560
I could see that Jason really lived by his beliefs.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.560
Jason invited me to see the construction project he's been volunteering.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.560
I felt like I had entered another world.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.560
People of different races worked alongside each other without prejudice.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.560
And they were all volunteers.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:08.500
Jason offered to study the Bible with me.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.500
Emma has asked me to study in the past and I've always refused.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:26.810
But this time I accepted.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:44.069
I liked my study and even enjoyed going to the Kingdom Hall occasionally.

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.069
But I have to work overtime to support my family.

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.069
I can't go to meetings every week.

00:02:52.069 --> 00:03:05.979
Hey Jason, how do you do it all?

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:11.979
Work, family, medians, even volunteer work.

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:20.539
I tried to keep in mind Jesus' words in Matthew 6 verse 22.

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:23.539
Jesus compared our eyes to a lamp.

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:28.539
He said if our eyes focused, our whole body will be bright.

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:34.650
It's impossible to focus on more than one thing at a time.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:41.460
Jesus wanted his followers to focus on a single purpose.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.460
That of doing God's will.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.460
Rather than being distracted by material things,

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.460
my wife and I lead a simple life, avoiding unnecessary debt

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.460
or acquiring possessions that consume a lot of time and attention.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.460
This way of life allows us to have time for what's truly important.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.460
If you asked Emma, which do you think she would prefer?

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.460
That you made more money or spent more time with her at the Kingdom Hall?

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:15.340
Jason's example really impressed me.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.339
He was an honest and diligent worker.

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:23.339
But he also kept secular work in its proper place.

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:26.339
It made me think about the choices I make.

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:32.339
And I decided that I too want to work whole soul for Jehovah.
