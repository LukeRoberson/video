00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:15.929
And getting baptized was the most important decision I ever made.

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.929
But it took some time to realize that was just a start of my Christian life.

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:22.929
Sometimes it was hard to show courage.

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:26.929
Why don't you people get involved and make a real difference for once?

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:35.299
And it was hard for my son too.

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:39.299
No thanks, I'm a Jehovah's Witness and I don't celebrate this.

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:40.299
What?

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:42.299
What are you doing?

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:44.299
I really liked Lucas.

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:47.299
And he was very sick.

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:50.299
I really wanted to sign his birthday card.

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:54.299
But dad helped me to see how Jehovah felt about it.

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:58.670
And that helped me to be brave.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:11.379
My student signed the card, but I'm going to do something else really good.

00:01:11.379 --> 00:01:14.379
My parents had always said a good example for me.

00:01:14.379 --> 00:01:18.379
But after I moved to serve where the need was greater,

00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:21.379
it seemed like my parents were growing apart.

00:01:21.379 --> 00:01:24.379
Are you both doing okay?

00:01:24.379 --> 00:01:26.379
Because you don't look okay.

00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:28.379
Of course we are okay.

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:29.379
We're doing wonderful, right?

00:01:29.379 --> 00:01:31.379
Yeah, we're doing good.

00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:35.379
I was really worried.

00:01:35.379 --> 00:01:37.379
Later they told me what helped them.

00:01:37.379 --> 00:01:39.379
Was there love for Jehovah?

00:01:39.379 --> 00:01:43.379
They meditated on the example of Abraham and Sarah,

00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:47.379
who showed honor to each other by listening and by caring.

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:51.379
That example really helped my parents.

00:01:51.379 --> 00:01:56.379
And since then, I've seen how it can help in any relationship.

00:01:56.379 --> 00:02:03.519
I'm a long way from home, but showing love to others,

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:06.519
it helps me to stay happy in my assignment.

00:02:06.519 --> 00:02:17.639
Now, Dr. Told us that our baby would likely be born with severe problems

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:20.639
and could even die.

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:25.180
It was more than I could bear.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.180
And because my husband was not one of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.180
I needed God's help more than ever to calm my heart

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.419
and help me explain why I could never have an abortion.

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:44.419
And even though it took me years before I would agree to a Bible study,

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:51.699
and even more years before I made enough changes to qualify for baptism,

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:55.699
the life we have now, seven Jehovah together,

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:58.699
nothing could make me happy.

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:03.460
Nothing could make us happy.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.460
Happiness really does come from serving Jehovah,

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.460
but serving him faithfully definitely takes courage.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.460
It was so hard for me to turn down that girl at school

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.740
and I felt so guilty for how involved I had gotten with her.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:26.280
My uncle used the Bible to help me get back on track

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.280
and to remind me of two other very important things

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.280
that Jehovah was proud of me and that I was not alone.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.280
James 1, 2 and 3 says,

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.280
consider it all joy my brothers when you meet with various trials,

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:51.280
knowing as you do that this tested quality of your faith produces endurance.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.280
I think about that scripture a lot,

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.280
because soon I'll probably be sent to prison for refusing military service.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:06.280
Being courageous with that classmate helped me build the faith and courage that I need now.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.280
I can give up anything for Jehovah.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.280
I might live in a small cell for now,

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.279
but in paradise I'm going to travel everywhere.

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:21.879
Sometimes I get lonely, but that's okay.

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:27.259
It's a choice that I've made to stay in my assignment right now.

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:30.259
In the future, if I choose to get married,

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:35.110
I hope to have a marriage like my parents.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.110
I really hope that Lucas is resurrected so I can show him around paradise

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.110
and teach him more about Jehovah.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.110
I showed him pictures,

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.029
but the real thing will be so much better.

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:53.029
Then I can hold my baby girl again.
