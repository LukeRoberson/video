00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:07.620
During these last days, we often hear news reports about emergencies and natural disasters.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.460
Now these are not just news headlines, these affect our brothers and sisters.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:18.980
As a result, branch offices around the world handle a wide variety of disasters.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.140
How does the coordinators committee of the governing body organize our response to such emergencies?

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:31.059
When emergencies occur, how do Bethelites at World Headquarters and at branches work together

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:33.060
to support our brothers?

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:50.990
No doubt you'll enjoy the following report from the coordinators committee.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.630
The number of disasters taking place worldwide is staggering.

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:03.950
Earthquakes and other natural disasters are taking place in one place after another,

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.629
just as Jesus said at Matthew 24-7.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:16.510
Even where natural disasters are rare and the economy appears stable, violent protests,

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.310
terrorist attacks, or epidemics can occur without warning.

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:32.140
In 2018, the coordinators committee directed all branches to establish a disaster relief

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:39.739
desk to oversee disaster preparedness and relief activities in their branch territory.

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:44.299
Let's see how the disaster relief desk works in each of the branches.

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:50.060
For example, in Indonesia, the disaster relief desk quickly responded

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.340
following a massive earthquake and tsunami.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.420
When the earthquake occurred, I was at the hotel where I was working.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.459
People were falling, unable to stand up and run,

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:06.459
so I decided to take cover under the door frame while holding the open door.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.460
I prayed to Jehovah.

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:14.060
Jehovah, do remember us. I was so scared.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.020
We tried to break in since my mother was trapped in the room.

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:23.180
I watched as the side wall of my room collapse.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.419
I could finally escape with my child through the collapse wall.

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:36.479
We received news at the branch office about the earthquake and tsunami

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.240
the disaster relief desk immediately assembled to discuss the situation.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.719
After a few hours, the circuit I was saying could confirm that none of the

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:47.039
publishers were injured. They were all safe.

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:51.919
We immediately organized relief supplies.

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:56.000
However, main roads were destroyed or blocked by landslide.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.479
Brothers from Balopo began the dangerous track to Palo.

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:05.680
The journeys through the mountainous region took them nearly 30 hours.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.069
And amazingly, not a single meeting was missed.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.669
Their continued focus on spiritual matters impressed us very, very much.

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:26.110
As with disaster relief desks in every branch, the brothers in Indonesia had received

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.590
guidelines from the co-ordinators committee, which helped them be prepared.

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:34.669
They quickly checked on the welfare of every publisher.

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:39.229
They verified safe locations where publishers could evacuate.

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:44.830
Arranged for food and water provided spiritual encouragement

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:50.270
and worked with the LDC to evaluate construction needs.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.550
The events in Indonesia illustrate how we respond to natural disasters.

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:03.099
Epidemics present a very different set of challenges.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.500
Even in developed countries, disease can quickly threaten the lives of many people,

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.219
spreading quietly and without warning.

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:18.779
Through the prevalence of air travel, dangerous illnesses can spread to other lands

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:21.259
before detection by health agencies.

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:28.379
Motivated by love, we are quick to act because lives may be at stake.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:37.259
Let's see how our brothers in Nigeria responded to the outbreak of an unidentified but deadly disease.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.939
It was a big concern to the people in the community as well as the branch committee

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:50.060
that people were getting sick and dying suddenly, young ones as well as adults,

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.860
and this included our dear brothers and sisters in the area.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:01.259
Immoragic fever is a general term for a serious illness caused by many viruses.

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:05.819
And at the outset, it's very difficult to know exactly what you're dealing with because

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:13.339
they all have similar symptoms like headaches, muscle pain, nausea, and fever, things like that.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.819
The branch committee got together, prayed over the matter,

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:22.220
and they decided that we needed to inform the governing body.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.180
When the governing body received our letter, they got in touch with us right away.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.540
In fact, they even set up an emergency video conference meeting with the branch committee.

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:42.620
We received a letter from them that same day, providing us clear direction as to how we should proceed.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.779
I appreciated very much the direction that the branch committee gave us at that time.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:56.459
This direction came very fast, and they gave us plenty of spiritual, emotional, material support.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.980
The branch committee advised us that we should thoroughly wash our hands, use sanitizer,

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.339
and cook our food properly.

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:17.170
We were actually instructed by headquarters to restrict movement at Bethel,

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.290
which means that no one could come in, no one could go out of Bethel.

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:28.050
That was up to 10 days, so we were an effect on a lockdown.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:34.610
It was difficult at first, but the brothers they supported it very well.

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:40.129
They realized that their lives were at stake, and they supported the branch arrangement.

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:44.209
The hemorrhagic fever outbreak actually turned out to be yellow fever,

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.370
which is transmitted by infected mosquitoes.

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:52.610
We felt somewhat relieved, although it's still dangerous,

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:58.290
but it's not contagious, and it's preventable through vaccine.

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:04.449
Just to be sure, we actually continued to keep Bethel on lockdown,

00:07:05.329 --> 00:07:08.930
and the brothers were still being quarantined for a short period of time.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:16.509
I feel very, very happy. The organization arranged all these things for us.

00:07:18.959 --> 00:07:24.720
They were not passive, but instead quickly took action, and this made us feel safe.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:31.600
The governing body has trained us well in providing us guidelines for disaster relief.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.399
We have been taught by the organization that when a disaster strikes,

00:07:36.399 --> 00:07:41.360
that we need to be ready, we need to be quick, we need to be efficient, and we need to be safe.

00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:45.839
Good communication during times of disaster is really important.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:51.920
Various brothers from world headquarters from the committee offices met with an Nigeria branch

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:56.399
to assess the situation and to be able to discuss the needs.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:03.040
So if an epidemic strikes in our area, there may be similar precautions that we need to take,

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.800
just like the brothers did in Nigeria.

00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:07.439
Proverbs 15-22 says,

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:15.839
plans fail when there is no consultation, but there is accomplishment through many advisors.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:24.560
As we have seen from these two examples, when a disaster occurs, various departments at world

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:32.799
headquarters assist the coordinators committee to analyze the needs and deliver practical assistance

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:40.240
to the branches. At the branch office, the disaster relief desk works closely with the service

00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:46.080
departments, local design construction departments, and many other departments,

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:52.960
depending on the nature of the emergency, all work together to help our brothers in need.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:59.039
When disaster strike, our brothers are quick to come to our aid.

00:08:59.759 --> 00:09:02.879
That is important because lives may be at stake.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.840
We always look to Jehovah during times of disaster.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:15.519
As we get deeper in the last days, we will likely have more opportunities to show love for

00:09:15.519 --> 00:09:23.600
one another through disaster relief. On behalf of the coordinators committee, we would like to thank

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:30.240
all of the branch committees, the disaster relief desks, the brothers and sisters working in

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:37.200
Bethel department's worldwide, the disaster relief committees, and all those who have

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:43.519
volunteered their time and resources to help our brothers. When we think of you,

00:09:44.399 --> 00:09:49.120
the words of 1 Thessalonians chapter 2 and verse 8 come to mind.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:56.639
So having tender affection for you, we were determined to impart to you not only the good

00:09:56.639 --> 00:10:04.159
news of God, but also our very selves because you became so beloved to us.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:13.600
That is the spirit that you brothers and sisters have shown, genuinely motivated by deep love for

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:22.559
Jehovah and your brothers. You have been willing to give your very selves. Please know that we love

00:10:22.559 --> 00:10:30.799
all of you very much for the wonderful spirit that you show.
