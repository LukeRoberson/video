WEBVTT

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:09.730
For 23 years, we've called this place home.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.730
We've raised a family here.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.500
Two beautiful girls.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.100
Six months ago, my boss called me into his office.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.699
The company was restructuring.

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.100
They valued my work, but if I wanted to keep my job,

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.100
I would need to move.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.899
It was a difficult decision.

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:32.700
My job allowed me to support my family well

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.700
and it had never interfered with our spiritual routine.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.700
We said many prayers about it.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.100
We discussed it as a family and we decided to move.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.899
But we were anxious.

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:51.299
My family has only ever known one home, one congregation.

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:53.899
My girls have many friends in the congregation.

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.299
Good examples who are helping them to serve Jehovah.

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:00.899
This is going to be hard on all of us.

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.099
A brother in our hall had moved into the congregation

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:05.500
a few years ago.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.299
I asked him how his family coped with the challenge.

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.299
He said that the key to staying grounded

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.299
is maintaining the one thing that should never change.

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:18.099
Our spiritual routine.

00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:20.900
But that requires work and planning

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.900
to make sure our move doesn't stop us

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.700
from getting to the meetings,

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.400
sharing in the ministry,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.000
spending time with our brothers and sisters

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.599
and looking after our family.

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:34.000
His advice was spot on.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.500
After some research,

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.599
I found a scripture that illustrated our situation.

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:41.599
And the rain poured down

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:44.200
and the floods came and the winds blew

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.900
and lashed against that house.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.700
But it did not cave in

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.299
for it had been founded on the rock.

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.599
The discrete man built his house on good foundations.

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:57.200
He took a plan

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.700
and he worked hard

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.099
when the storm came.

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:02.700
His house survived.

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.000
As a family,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.099
we needed a plan that would help us

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:09.500
stay spiritually grounded through our move.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.000
So we wrote our own plan.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.699
Just like the discrete man,

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:16.500
we wanted to build our move

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.699
on a strong spiritual foundation.

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:20.699
So we made a visit

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:24.000
to our new congregation ahead of our move.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.500
Over the years,

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.099
it becomes a comfort to walk into a kingdom hall

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.500
and see familiar faces.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.500
Walking into our new congregation

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.199
reminded me how much we're going to miss everyone.

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:40.099
But the Bible tells us that

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.400
with the measure we measure out,

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.000
others will measure to us in return.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.259
So we resolve to show love first.

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:52.659
Hello, Angelica.

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:54.759
Hi, I'm Samantha, nice to meet you.

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:58.060
The best way to get to know our new congregation

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.659
is to work with the brothers and sisters in the ministry.

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:03.560
No matter where we go,

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.560
we'll find people that loved Jehovah and each other.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.860
Moving day finally arrived.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.159
The last boxes were packed.

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.960
We got the door one final time

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:28.439
and began our journey to our new home.

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:30.340
It took effort,

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.840
but visiting the congregation ahead of time

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.340
was well worth it.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.639
Look, we already have friends here.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.939
Unpacking seemed to never end.

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:46.740
But the one thing that we all promised ourselves

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.539
at family worship

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:50.939
was that we would not let our move

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:55.750
affect our spiritual routine.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.159
Does anyone see my ties?

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:02.560
Found them.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.060
We planned that we wouldn't let anything stop us

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.560
from going to the meetings.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.759
The ministry is very different.

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:13.560
We've had to adapt

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.660
and learn new techniques.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.759
The brothers and sisters are different too.

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:25.259
It's important not to focus on negative comparisons.

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:29.160
Instead, be positive.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.759
During this transition,

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:33.360
it is especially important to be sensitive

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.160
to our spiritual needs.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.759
Family worship is vital.

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:41.759
Keeping spiritually grounded

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:45.160
through such a big transition isn't easy,

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.660
especially with a family.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.560
It took a lot of time and energy to care for our needs.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.160
Not just spiritually,

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.459
but emotionally too.

00:04:55.459 --> 00:04:56.759
Planning ahead,

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:58.660
like the discrete man,

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.660
helped our family to stay spiritually grounded.
