WEBVTT

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:08.980
Well, as we consider James 5, we get the sense of how much Jehovah loves us, and he has

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:17.820
such a desire for us to live forever in experience the real life in his new world.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.739
Let's open our Bibles to James chapter 5, and let's read verse 11 together, and let's

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:27.260
get the sense of Jehovah's love for us.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.179
In fact, as we consider the book of James, it's really that Jehovah talking to us, and

00:00:33.179 --> 00:00:39.100
really expressing his desire for us to live forever in what we need to do to do so.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.899
So let's look at James chapter 5, note as verse 11 says, look, we consider happy those

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.659
who've endured.

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:52.939
You've heard of the endurance of Job, and you've seen the outcome Jehovah gave, that Jehovah

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:57.899
is very tender in affection and merciful.

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:07.859
Now endurance for a Christian means to do what is right, despite opposition, persecution,

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:14.900
temptation, the trials we face, or really anything that can knock us off our course of integrity.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.780
As Christians, we endure.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.939
We continue to keep our devotion to Jehovah.

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:26.140
And Jehovah's telling us, if we endure, we'll be happy.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.780
One of the reasons we'll be happy is because Jehovah is the rewarder of those earnestly

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.780
seeking him.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.379
It's as if Jehovah is telling us, it's going to be worth it.

00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:37.900
Just hang in there.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.459
Don't give up.

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:46.939
What I have in store for you personally, you're going to be fine, such joy in, and you're

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.219
going to say it was worth it.

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:54.420
Now Jehovah does more than just tell us that.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.379
And notice what the qualities he displays toward us in verse 11, toward the end there.

00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:04.739
It says that Jehovah is very tender in affection and merciful.

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:09.939
Now the footnote brings out tender in affection, could also be compassionate, or is Jehovah's

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:17.020
ability to understand our makeup, our background, and extend forgiveness toward us.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.939
But more than just that, by saying that he is merciful, he's letting us know that he

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:25.580
is actively helping us.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.939
Because that's what mercy can mean.

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:33.060
It means seeing someone in distress and actively helping them.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.060
And that's what Jehovah does for us.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.659
He helps us to endure.

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:44.580
In fact, when I think about that word, mercy, I think about the lesson number 20, be truthful

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.819
and become Jehovah's friend series.

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:53.580
That's the account where Caleb is playing, and he knocks over and breaks a vase, a precious

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.419
item there in the house.

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:59.500
And as his father inquires what happens, he doesn't tell the truth.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.659
He tells a lie.

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:07.259
Most father patiently reasons with them, gives them a little bit of counsel, and Caleb

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:10.419
apologizes, and his father forgives him.

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:12.099
But what does his father do at the end?

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.580
He says, come on, let us pick up the pieces together.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.539
And isn't that what Jehovah does for us?

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:26.139
His mercy moves us to help us, to comfort us, and as a result, kind of pick up the pieces

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:32.590
in our life and help us keep going in our service to him.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.909
Now Jehovah also provides us something else to help us endure.

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:40.069
That's outlined for us in verse 10.

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:47.990
James chapter 5, and notice verse 10, says, brothers, take as a pattern of the suffering

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:56.789
of evil and the exercising of patience, the prophets, who spoke in the name of Jehovah.

00:03:56.789 --> 00:04:02.629
So we have the pattern, patience, and the prophets.

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:10.870
So patience is that quality that helps us put up with difficult circumstances and maintain

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.349
a positive attitude.

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:14.990
And for a Christian, it means waiting on Jehovah.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.550
It's closely linked to endurance.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:26.029
Now what is the patience, or what is the pattern of patience that the prophets set that

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:29.149
we can benefit from?

00:04:29.149 --> 00:04:35.509
As Jehovah had recorded in his word, the circumstances and lives of faithful servants in the past,

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:43.430
the prophets, and how they endured can really help us to endure in these last days.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.550
Let's just consider some of the things the prophets had to deal with.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.069
They had to deal with unresponsive territory.

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:57.230
In fact, Isaiah preached for over four decades to a people that very rarely listen to him.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.430
They dealt with persecution.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.790
They dealt with physical abuse.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.189
And they had challenging assignments.

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:10.189
In fact, Ezekiel had a lay on his left side for 390 days, and then on his right side,

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:11.189
440 days.

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:13.550
And Jeremiah had a challenging assignment once.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:20.509
He had to travel 300 miles, a very difficult terrain to bury a linen belt, to return back

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:25.750
home, and then to do it again, 1,200 miles in all.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.389
He endured that challenging assignment.

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:38.750
They had to deal with rejection, betrayal of companions, opposition, death of loved ones,

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:45.230
and even the seeming delay of the fulfillment of Jehovah's promises.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.949
Many of them expressed that they were just tired of all the bad things around them and

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:52.269
hearing bad news.

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:58.750
Well, their circumstances are very similar to the things Jehovah's people we experienced

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:59.750
today.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:07.949
Well, what pattern did they set that helped them to endure that we can benefit from?

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:13.629
Well, let's consider some of their words and what helped them to endure.

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:17.709
And as we consider their words, notice the pattern that emerges.

00:06:17.709 --> 00:06:23.389
But take for example, Jonah, at Jonah, chapter 2, verse 9, you will find him in the depth

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:25.629
of the fish's belly.

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:26.629
He is erred.

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:30.790
He doesn't know if Jehovah ever forgives him, but notice what he says.

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:37.029
He says, but as for me, with the voice of Thanksgiving, I will sacrifice to you.

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:44.709
What I have vowed, I will pay, Jonah resolved in his heart that despite the past, moving

00:06:44.709 --> 00:06:51.790
forward, he was going to obey Jehovah that helped him endure.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:58.670
Joel, chapter 9, or chapter 1, verse 19, ones are trying to tell him to give up in his

00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:59.670
worship to Jehovah.

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:00.670
It wasn't worth it.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:01.670
What did he say?

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:05.550
He says, to you, Jehovah, I shall call.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.990
To you, O Jehovah, I will call.

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:17.189
He made the personal choice that no matter what anyone else does, I'm serving Jehovah.

00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:18.189
What about Amos?

00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:23.949
Amos was told that his services weren't needed, and he really wasn't qualified to be a prophet.

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:26.829
Well, did that stop him?

00:07:26.829 --> 00:07:31.470
At Amos 38, he says, the sovereign Lord has spoken, who will not prophesy?

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:37.550
Yes, he made the personal choice that no matter what anyone else does, or when everyone

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:41.629
else says he should do, he was going to obey Jehovah.

00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:46.389
He was going to continue in his course of integrity.

00:07:46.389 --> 00:07:53.750
A Micah, a Micah 7.7 said, but as for me, I will keep on the lookout for Jehovah, the

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:59.709
lookout personally in his life, in his life, as well as the promises that were to come.

00:07:59.709 --> 00:08:05.790
He says, I will show a waiting attitude for the God of my salvation.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:11.029
Do you see the pattern that's emerging that the prophets laid out for us?

00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:18.269
Despite difficult circumstances, they poured their heart out to Jehovah, and they personally

00:08:18.269 --> 00:08:22.069
resolved that they were not going to give up.

00:08:22.069 --> 00:08:26.189
They are going to trust in Jehovah.

00:08:26.189 --> 00:08:31.009
And really, when we look at Habakkuk 3, we really see how that pattern comes to the

00:08:31.009 --> 00:08:32.009
four.

00:08:32.009 --> 00:08:33.909
Let's go to Habakkuk 3.

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:38.350
When we know Habakkuk, he was wondering when the end was going to come.

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.350
It seemed to be delaying.

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:45.909
He was worn out from the bad news and the bad things he saw around him.

00:08:45.909 --> 00:08:49.350
But notice the pattern he set for us.

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:55.590
Habakkuk 3, verse 16 and 17, he talks about all the discouraging things that are taking

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:57.350
place around him.

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:59.830
But notice his resolve, verse 18.

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:06.269
He says, yet as for me, I will exalt in Jehovah.

00:09:06.269 --> 00:09:11.230
I will be joyful in the God of my salvation.

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:13.629
The sovereign Lord Jehovah is my strength.

00:09:13.629 --> 00:09:22.389
He will make my feet like those of a deer and cause me to tread on high places.

00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:28.070
The 2018, November, a watchtower said this regarding verse 18.

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:33.830
One scholar says, this verse could literally mean, I will jump for joy in the Lord.

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:38.309
I will spin around for delight in God.

00:09:38.309 --> 00:09:44.429
What gave Habakkuk such joy when just a little bit ago, previously, he was discouraged because

00:09:44.429 --> 00:09:46.870
of what was taking place around him?

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:55.549
When the member of what verse 18 says, he starts off by saying, yet as for me, yes, he

00:09:55.549 --> 00:10:00.590
determined in his heart and mind that he was going to trust in Jehovah.

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:05.789
He was going to endure, and that gave him a positive attitude.

00:10:05.789 --> 00:10:10.549
Nothing changed, the timeline didn't change, the circumstances didn't change, but as

00:10:10.549 --> 00:10:14.990
the attitude did, and that strengthened him.

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:18.149
So what have we learned this morning?

00:10:18.149 --> 00:10:23.309
Well we learned that Jehovah wants us to endure, and he has many good things in store

00:10:23.309 --> 00:10:24.830
for us.

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:30.149
We've also learned that he is actively helping us to endure, comforting us, strengthening

00:10:30.149 --> 00:10:32.509
us, forgiving us.

00:10:32.509 --> 00:10:39.149
We've also learned about the pattern of the prophets, how we can personally choose to stay

00:10:39.149 --> 00:10:43.629
loyal to Jehovah and be determined not to give up.
