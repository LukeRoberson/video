WEBVTT

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.040
All right.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.040
Okay.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.040
One more step.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.040
All right.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.040
One more step.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.040
Okay.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.039
You're close.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.039
Yeah.

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:10.039
There it is.

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:13.039
It's the lemon tree.

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:15.039
I've always wanted one.

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:16.039
Thank you so much.

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:17.039
I love it.

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.039
Have you had first anniversary?

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:19.039
Oh, thank you.

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:20.039
Can we take a picture?

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.039
Yeah.

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:22.039
Okay.

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.350
First lemon pie.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.350
S.K.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:01:24.760
Before we go on the territory, do you mind?

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.760
If we make a stop first?

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:33.719
Today's our wedding anniversary.

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:35.719
Oh, I didn't know.

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:37.719
I'm so sorry.

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:43.719
When Sharon died, I was going through some especially raw days myself.

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:46.719
I keep getting flooded with memories.

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:48.719
That's normal.

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:51.719
You know what my number one help was?

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:52.719
Was prayer.

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:56.159
I do pray.

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.159
But it stirs up emotions.

00:01:58.159 --> 00:01:59.159
I'm trying to keep down.

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.159
Don't keep the emotions down.

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.159
Let them out with Jehovah.

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.159
Tell them how you really feel, Matt.

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:12.159
Your thoughts are safe with him.

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:19.159
You know, first John 3.20 tells us that God is greater than our hearts and knows all things.

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:23.159
He understands us better than we understand ourselves.

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:28.159
And he's giving us help now that's specific for our needs.

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.159
It's going to get better.

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:35.159
Is there anything else you do on those especially raw days?

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:37.159
There is.

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:40.159
But it may be the opposite of what you want to do.

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:41.159
What's that?

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.159
Find someone that you can help.

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:50.020
Jesus said that's a guaranteed formula for happiness.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:03:01.280
Remind me next year that this is Matt's wedding anniversary day.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:15.319
Hey, Dan. Have you seen Javier? He's got a part tonight.

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:16.319
No, I haven't seen him.

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.319
And they received some bad news today. So really, there they are.

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:26.900
Our first part tonight will be handled by Brother Javier Vales.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:33.099
It's the...

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:37.099
Well, I should put it if I read it from the reference.

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.099
Yeah, it's the 2011 watchtower.

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:42.099
So we've had a great meeting.

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:44.099
That's conclude with song and prayer.

00:03:44.099 --> 00:04:01.330
Thanks for your text last night.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.330
I know my talk was not what it should have been.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.330
He did fine.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.330
Especially after your day yesterday.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.330
We always parent on time.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.330
And now we're being evicted.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.860
And for no reason.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.860
How are we going to find a new place to live just two weeks?

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.860
After I asked K.E.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.860
We sold everything to make this move.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.860
But it's been one thing after another.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.740
We can't seem to catch a break.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.740
I'm so sorry.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.740
Lauren and I experienced a rough patch like this,

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.740
soon after we were married.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:35.740
We prayed a lot.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.740
We kept our expenses to a minimum.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.740
We did something else too.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.740
We made it a goal to stick to a good spiritual team.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.740
And not isolate ourselves.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.740
And that's why I really want to commend both you

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.740
for coming last night.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.740
I know I made Jehovah's Heart Bad.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:51.740
Thanks, Matt.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.790
Try it.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.040
We want to show Jehovah we trust in him.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.040
Remember, it goes both ways.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.040
With someone loyal, Jehovah will act in loyalty.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.040
He won't let you down.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.040
You'll see.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:47.870
Just come with me this one time.

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:48.870
You know we can't do that.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:49.870
We've already decided.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:50.870
Explain to me why.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:51.870
I'll show it to you.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:52.870
Why?

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:53.870
From this?

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:54.870
Yes.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:55.870
No, stop.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:56.870
I'm done.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:57.870
I'm done with your religion.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:58.870
I'm done with this.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:19.100
Ian.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:25.259
Let's hear from you.

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:29.569
Any further comments?

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:30.569
Sister Raples.

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:37.079
Did you get to talk to Levi?

00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:39.079
No.

00:06:39.079 --> 00:06:42.079
But I did talk to his mom.

00:06:42.079 --> 00:06:47.810
She said that the divorce has been really difficult.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:48.810
We should do something.

00:06:49.810 --> 00:07:08.509
You know we can do something.

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:09.509
The Chinese will be Levi.

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:11.509
Are you kidding me?

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:20.810
Use the Chinese food all the time with...

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:26.259
I can't believe he left.

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:30.259
Levi, read this scripture.

00:07:30.259 --> 00:07:34.279
Here in Psalms.

00:07:34.279 --> 00:07:38.279
Even if my own father and mother abandoned me.

00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:42.279
Jehovah himself will take me in.

00:07:42.279 --> 00:07:46.279
Jehovah will take you in too, Levi.

00:07:46.279 --> 00:07:48.279
You know, loved ones may leave us.

00:07:48.279 --> 00:07:51.279
But Jehovah never will.

00:07:51.279 --> 00:07:53.279
You and your mom are never alone.

00:07:53.279 --> 00:07:57.279
We're all part of Jehovah's family.

00:07:57.279 --> 00:07:59.279
That's right, Levi.

00:07:59.279 --> 00:08:00.279
We all have each other.

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:22.829
Jehovah is a God who hates injustice.

00:08:22.829 --> 00:08:25.829
In fact, he's promised to eliminate it.

00:08:25.829 --> 00:08:28.829
We can read that promise together in the book of Psalm 37.

00:08:28.829 --> 00:08:32.399
We'll begin reading it.

00:08:32.399 --> 00:08:50.179
I feel bad for brother Tobias.

00:08:50.179 --> 00:08:52.179
It always seems to be in pain.

00:08:52.179 --> 00:08:53.179
Yeah.

00:08:53.179 --> 00:08:54.179
It's his hip.

00:08:54.179 --> 00:08:56.179
But he's always faithful.

00:08:56.179 --> 00:08:59.179
Never misses a meeting.

00:08:59.179 --> 00:09:01.179
Does he live by himself?

00:09:01.179 --> 00:09:03.179
I think his wife died a while back.

00:09:03.179 --> 00:09:04.179
It's just him now.

00:09:04.179 --> 00:09:17.639
Good morning, brother Tobias.

00:09:17.639 --> 00:09:19.639
Levi.

00:09:19.639 --> 00:09:22.639
We've had a ton of lees falling in our yard that needed cleaning up.

00:09:22.639 --> 00:09:24.639
Man, I thought I'd see if he needs some help around here.

00:09:24.639 --> 00:09:33.019
Far be it for me to refuse free hope.

00:09:33.019 --> 00:09:35.019
Levi, come.

00:09:35.019 --> 00:09:47.450
So you went to Bethel?

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:49.450
Then Gillian?

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:51.450
I did.

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:53.450
I want to go to Bethel someday.

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:56.450
Harvey and Michelle, they took me not that long ago.

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:58.450
And I really liked what I saw.

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:01.450
That is an excellent goal.

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:05.450
You'll never go wrong putting spiritual things first in your life.

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:11.679
And where did you work when you were in Bethel?

00:10:11.679 --> 00:10:13.679
I worked on a line of type machine.

00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:14.679
Line of type?

00:10:14.679 --> 00:10:15.679
What's that?

00:10:15.679 --> 00:10:18.679
Come, let me show you how we did it on our day.

00:10:18.679 --> 00:10:23.500
Don't sit down.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:57.740
There's a picture.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:58.740
Good night, everyone.

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:00.740
I'll be back tomorrow to fish up the leaves.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:01.740
Sounds good.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:16.509
I'll have a hot chocolate ready.

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:28.830
I never alone part of Jehovah's family.
