00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.730
The account from which the words of today's scripture text is drawn

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:12.970
really are the scriptural introduction to these two women

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.250
Mary and Martha

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:18.929
What do we know about them?

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:25.969
Well, they were siblings and they were both women of faith disciples of Christ and

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.530
and each had a unique

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.649
personality and outlook. That's not unusual in families, is it?

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:45.090
Now we can imagine their excitement in the late summer or early autumn of the year 32 CE as they prepared their home for a very

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.649
special guest

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:55.369
Jesus the Son of God. Can you imagine what it would be to have Jesus visit your home?

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:58.929
Well, when Jesus arrived

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:04.530
Martha was busy with preparation, but Mary chose to sit at Jesus' feet and

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.329
the account tells us that she kept listening and

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.579
Martha was a product of her upbringing. In first century Jewish life,

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:20.019
women were taught to care for domestic duties.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.219
So her frustration with her sister reached a breaking point, didn't it?

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:30.859
And we can read about it in Luke chapter 10. Turn there with me, please.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.379
To Luke chapter 10 and beginning in verse 40,

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.819
we read that Martha on the other hand was distracted

00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:45.700
with attending to many duties.

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:53.939
So she came to Jesus and said, Lord, does it not matter to you that my sister has left me alone to attend to things?

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.180
Tell her to gut up and come help me. I

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:05.459
think I've heard my sisters say that to me in our childhood days.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.259
Get up and come help me.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.370
It's a very typical of siblings, isn't it? Well, there was a problem,

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:19.969
but was Mary the problem.

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:25.650
Well, the scripture indicates that Martha was distracted.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.650
So she was probably surprised when rather than correcting

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:35.169
Mary, Jesus said in verse 41, Martha,

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:40.610
Martha, you were anxious and disturbed about many things. A

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.530
gentle

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:52.909
readjusting in verse 42, a few things though are needed or just one.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:01.469
So Martha needed to adjust her thinking she was distracted and then rather than correct

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:09.710
Mary, what did Jesus do? He commended her, didn't it? Now that was noteworthy too because in

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:15.389
first century Jewish life, women were not encouraged to pursue academic studies.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.870
For a woman to sit at the feet of a rabbi for the purpose of taking an instruction was very unusual,

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:30.990
but Jesus was not offended by it. In fact, he commended Mary. She chose the good portion or

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.469
the footnote on the verse tells us she chose the best portion.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.069
Was Martha offended by the council? Well, just a few months later,

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.830
we meet Mary and Martha again in the Bible account in John chapter 11.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.550
And on this occasion, very sadly, their brother Lazarus had died.

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:02.750
But Martha was the first to greet Jesus when he entered Bethany and what followed was a deep

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:09.229
spiritual discussion that reveals Martha's faith. Not only did she express faith in the resurrection,

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:16.829
but she had this to say about Jesus if we look at John chapter 11 and verse 27.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:26.990
She said to him, yes, Lord, I have believed that you are the Christ, the Son of God, the one coming

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:37.279
into the world. Martha was a woman of faith. In verse 32, we find the only words in the Bible

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:44.079
attributed to Mary. Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:54.800
Well, both women were disciples of Christ, women of faith. Our last glimpse comes just six days

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:03.040
before Jesus died. He had opportunity one more time to enjoy sweet fellowship with this family

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:10.639
who we loved so much. In the home of Simon the leper, Jesus, Mary, Martha, Lazarus,

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:20.800
who had been resurrected. And Jesus apostles gathered for a meal. Can you imagine what that

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:29.519
must have been like? Now, in chapter 12 of John, verse 2, we read that they spread an evening meal

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:39.040
for Jesus. And Martha was serving them. So here's her hospitable spirit coming to the fore.

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:50.879
And Jesus didn't criticize her for that. Mary enters the scene in verse 3. She poured profumed oil

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:56.160
on Jesus' head. Subsequent verses tell us that the oil would have been worth about a year's

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:04.959
wage for the common wage earner in that time. Where did Mary get that oil? The Bible doesn't say,

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:11.839
but the point is she gave her best. Rather than being focused on food, she was focused on Jesus.

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:17.600
And just as she had been criticized earlier, she's criticized again, but not by Martha.

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:25.519
On this occasion, Judas takes the lead. The apparel accounts in Matthew and Mark tell us that

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:32.319
the other apostles joined in. What seemed to be a valid objection, the oil could have been sold

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:41.920
and given to the poor. But again, Jesus comes to Mary's defense, verse 7, let her alone.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:50.639
What lessons can we learn from these two women? Here are three.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:59.279
1. Spiritual people can make different choices. They have different strengths. Isn't it true

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:05.519
two siblings can grow up in the same spiritual home and on reaching adulthood, one may feel the

00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:11.839
need to marry and have children and may do a beautiful job of bringing up children in the way of

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:19.120
Jehovah. While the other, even from a young age, may be focused on the full-time ministry,

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:27.120
and that's the goal. And in pursuing that goal, the sibling may decide to forego having a family,

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:35.519
may decide not to marry in order to serve Jehovah undistracted. Question is one more spiritual than

00:07:35.519 --> 00:07:47.199
the other, not necessarily. Jesus didn't counsel Martha because she was hospitable. He counseled Martha

00:07:47.279 --> 00:07:55.819
because she was distracted. In his life story, Stanley Jones, who spent seven years in solitary

00:07:55.819 --> 00:08:04.620
confinement in a Chinese prison, speaks of a time when he became distracted. He was able to get

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:11.500
hold of some textbooks, and he began to read those textbooks, and he enjoyed them very much,

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.819
but he says, then I realized I was neglecting my Bible reading.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:25.339
Now, if it's possible for an imprisoned missionary to become distracted, we would be fooling ourselves

00:08:25.339 --> 00:08:32.220
to think we couldn't. Could a Christian parent become distracted? Could a pioneer become

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:41.259
distracted? Could a Bethelite become distracted? Secular pursuits, a career, education,

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:51.340
problems, hobbies? Any of those could distract us so that we neglect spiritual priorities.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:57.500
And that's the lesson. Each day, we need to demonstrate that we're choosing the good portion.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:05.980
The second lesson, those around you may not always understand the reason for your choices.

00:09:07.259 --> 00:09:13.340
Think about it. Mary was criticized first by her sister and then by responsible brothers

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:22.379
for her choices. And something similar could happen today. We may have relatives or

00:09:22.379 --> 00:09:30.059
brothers or sisters who don't understand why we sacrifice our resources, our energy, our time

00:09:31.259 --> 00:09:37.580
to pursue the goals that we pursue. When that happens, don't be disheartened. Remember,

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:44.620
you're not the first. Mary knew what it was like, and remember Jesus understood and appreciated.

00:09:45.179 --> 00:09:53.820
Finally, lesson number three, like Jesus, be quick to commend those around you who have

00:09:53.820 --> 00:10:00.860
demonstrated that they're choosing the good portion. In our congregation, we have youngsters

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:07.340
and older ones as well. Right here in our work environment, we're surrounded by individuals

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:15.659
who have chosen the good portion, commend them, express appreciation, and in reflecting that

00:10:15.659 --> 00:10:23.659
appreciative attitude of Jehovah and Jesus, you will strengthen your own resolve to go on choosing

00:10:23.659 --> 00:10:25.259
the good portion.
