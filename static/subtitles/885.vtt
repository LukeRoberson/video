00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:10.730
At a very young age, I lost both my father and my mother.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:23.609
I could not understand if God was a God of love, why had He taken my parents from me?

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.929
I grew up attending Catholic school and I asked a lot of questions, but they never had

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:34.289
answers for me.

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:37.090
I worked as a prison security officer.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.250
I got to know a lot of the people I worked with.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.490
And among them, Simone, she was a difficult person.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.969
She was confrontational, strong in her opinions on certain things.

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:56.119
And wouldn't let it go.

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:59.960
I really enjoy witnessing informally, so I would pray constantly.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:08.540
And I'd ask Jehovah to give me courage, because courage doesn't come naturally.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:16.260
So, one day at work, I told her, I really enjoy helping others learn more about the Bible.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.870
A book most of them already have it home.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.870
She just turned to me and said,

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:23.870
No way.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.790
I don't talk about the Bible, so you can stop right there and don't bring it up again.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.950
I didn't like Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:42.430
I was prejudiced against them.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:43.430
Susanna?

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:51.750
Well, she was different.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.150
Every day I was observing her.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.579
I would watch her.

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:02.709
And she was so kind.

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:08.389
Then I would think I would start to question, you know, how can someone like Susanna really

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:11.990
be one of Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.389
And then about three to four months later, Simone came to me and said,

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:23.340
Susanna, look, I have to ask you for a favor.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.219
I came to ask you for that study.

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:28.259
I was taken aback.

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:33.560
I almost didn't believe I had heard her correctly.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.599
Jehovah took such good care of me.

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:41.520
He explained to me why I had lost my parents when I was a child.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:53.569
And those answers that I'd always been searching for, I finally had them.

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.530
Jehovah pays attention and he gives us courage to speak about him.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.569
Had she not talked to me about the truth, imagine how different my life would be.

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.729
It's his name that's at stake.

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:12.689
So we can overcome our fear, regardless of the place, regardless of the moment or situation

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:15.729
and especially, regardless of the type of person.
