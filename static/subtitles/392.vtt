00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:08.900
Well, the words of today's text may have reminded you of the admonition in 1 Corinthians 6,

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:19.019
18, where Paul wrote flee from sexual immorality, or perhaps the words in 2 Timothy 2, 22, where

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:30.399
he wrote to Timothy flee from youthful desires. In today's text, a father is counseling

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:39.479
his son, and encouraging him to stay away from sexual immorality. In Proverbs 7, the

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:47.179
counsel is strengthened by means of an experience. The king describes a scene that he personally

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:53.520
witnessed, and we read about it in Proverbs 7, beginning in verse 6, so why don't we turn

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:07.359
here together? In Proverbs 7 and verse 6, and you can imagine a father encouraging his son,

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:16.480
and he relates this experience from the window of my house through my lattice. I look down, and as I

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:26.959
observed the naÃ¯ve ones, or as the footnote says, the inexperienced ones, like you son, the

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:35.239
inexperienced ones, I discerned among the youth a young man lacking good sense, or in what

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:43.799
of heart. Now that's the first strike against the young man, isn't he's young? And as a result,

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:52.159
he's inexperienced, the two go together. But the father proceeds to describe what he observed and

00:01:52.159 --> 00:02:01.439
the progression of events that led to a tragic outcome for the young man. So it says in verse 8, the

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:12.120
young man passed along the street near her corner. Now the her is a prostitute. What is he doing in the

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:22.280
neighborhood? Well, we're told that he marched in the direction of her house. Now the word March

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:31.800
implies a sense of confidence, doesn't it? Isn't it interesting that a young person is often

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:42.520
confident, even in risky situations? Why? Because a young person lacks experience, and can't always

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:52.979
foresee the implications of a situation or the outcome. Another factor is highlighted in verse 9,

00:02:53.939 --> 00:03:02.979
in the twilight, in the evening, at the approach of night and darkness. So now we have inexperienced,

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:15.139
we have bad neighborhood. We have a young man who is confident, who evidently has no intention of

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:23.460
committing a morality, may even feel that he's in control of the circumstances. And it's night time.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:32.340
I know as a young man where I grew up, everybody knew there were certain places or parts of town

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:43.000
where you didn't go after dark, because it was a recipe for disaster. In verse 10, the inevitable

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:51.800
happens, the young man is confronted by a prostitute. And rather than turning around and leaving the

00:03:51.800 --> 00:04:05.560
situation, he engages with her in conversation. And in verse 22, we read the result. The culmination

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:14.840
of this progression of ingredients, suddenly he goes after her like a bull to the slaughter,

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:24.519
like a fool to be punished in the stocks. Now what do we learn from this word suddenly?

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:34.610
Well, simply this, that in any situation, we can cross a line where we no longer control the

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:41.410
circumstances. Rather, the circumstances control us. And isn't that what happened to the young man?

00:04:42.209 --> 00:04:51.490
He put himself in a situation going down a path that eventually had or culminated in his

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:59.250
committing sexual immorality. And the seriousness of the matter is highlighted in the

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:06.050
B portion of verse 23 where it says it will cost him his life. So there's a ripple effect.

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:13.970
Certainly his relationship with Jehovah was damaged. His relationship with his family would be

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:22.610
affected. And there are even physical factors, illnesses that can result from sexual immorality.

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:33.730
Now note in verse 26, the father says she has caused many to fall down slain. And those she has

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:43.410
killed are numerous. And as our watchtower recently made the point, thousands are disfellowshipped

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:52.879
every year from Jehovah's family because of sexual immorality. Now a question that Brother

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:59.439
Kiddell addressed is it only the inexperienced that fall victim to this sad progression.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.959
Well, let's look at an illustration that appeared in the watchtower article. You'll probably

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:12.639
remember this illustration. And here we see two married couples having suffered a gather,

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:21.680
a seeming innocent situation. But what are the two folks sitting closest to the camera,

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:28.639
Duhan? They're flirting, aren't they? You see the sister, she's twirling her hair,

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:40.850
her finger. And the brother is saying in essence, I only have eyes for you. And you can see

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:48.610
wedding rings on all four of those individuals' hands. It's a start down a slippery slope, isn't it?

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:56.370
And as a portrayed in the watchtower, this couple would later accidentally on purpose bump into

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:03.009
each other in the parking lot of the kingdom hall after an evening meeting, engage in conversation,

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:10.209
and that progressed to texting. Now, the good news is, as depicted in the watchtower, this,

00:07:10.209 --> 00:07:17.089
these folks re-elost that they were headed down a dangerous path and took steps to corrupt it.

00:07:17.089 --> 00:07:21.250
But wouldn't it have been better if they hadn't gone down the road, again, was?

00:07:22.209 --> 00:07:30.129
It's a good reminder for all of us, whatever our age or circumstance. Here at Bethel,

00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:39.329
we interact with ones of the opposite sex, and many of us are married, many are not.

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:48.209
But as we were reminded, we want to make sure our conduct is chased and pleasing to Jehovah.

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:56.050
Same holds true at the kingdom hall, and in our use of the Internet, and in our choice of

00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:05.410
entertainment. See, we don't want to start down a path that could take us away from Jehovah.

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:13.889
I'll never forget a pioneer sister who used to counsel us young people in the congregation,

00:08:14.529 --> 00:08:21.569
and we loved her. But she had an expression that she would tell us, if you're not going to burn

00:08:21.569 --> 00:08:31.649
down the barn, don't strike the mat. Now, what's the point of her statement? Why start a progression

00:08:31.649 --> 00:08:39.090
of events that we know will lead to sadness and tragedy? So we don't even go there,

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:45.970
and even if we're inexperienced, we can act wisely. What did the psalmist say? He said,

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:54.929
how can a young man keep his path clean by keeping on guard according to Jehovah's word?

00:08:55.570 --> 00:09:04.529
So Jehovah's given us everything we need to remain clean. So talk to Jehovah about it,

00:09:04.529 --> 00:09:10.610
be alert to identify, and determine to avoid dangerous situations.

00:09:11.889 --> 00:09:18.450
And then we don't have to experience the sad outcome of the young man described in Proverbs

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:32.370
chapter 7. Instead, we can succeed in fleeing from sexual immorality.
