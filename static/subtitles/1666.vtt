00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:16.780
American motorcycles from my passion.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:25.050
We'd make them louder, faster, and lots of chrome.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.050
It wasn't just a bike.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.050
I had a great American sports car.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.050
I had a brand new house.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.049
I had a good job.

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:36.049
Really, I had the American dream.

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:37.049
And I had a great life.

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:39.049
I was always looking for fun,

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:41.049
and I always seemed to find it.

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:46.130
Even though I thought I had everything,

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.130
there was still something missing.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.130
The Vietnam War was brewing.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.130
It was raging.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.130
People were dying, and it really bothered me.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.130
When I was six years old,

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.130
my aunt, who just became a witness,

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.130
she showed me this book.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.130
And there's a picture inside.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.130
I remember so well.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.129
It's a varmageddon.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.129
And that scares a little kid.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.129
I thought, I don't want to be there.

00:01:07.129 --> 00:01:08.129
But a few pages later,

00:01:08.129 --> 00:01:11.129
there's a picture of the paradise.

00:01:11.129 --> 00:01:12.129
I never forgot it.

00:01:12.129 --> 00:01:14.129
Now I always thought I wanted to be there someday.

00:01:14.129 --> 00:01:17.129
So I thought, maybe my aunt has something.

00:01:17.129 --> 00:01:18.129
What have I got to lose?

00:01:18.129 --> 00:01:19.129
So I called her and said,

00:01:19.129 --> 00:01:22.129
send over some witnesses.

00:01:22.129 --> 00:01:25.129
So I had a couple of studies with the brother,

00:01:25.129 --> 00:01:27.129
but it didn't really make sense yet.

00:01:27.129 --> 00:01:30.129
And my lifestyle hadn't changed.

00:01:30.129 --> 00:01:33.129
I was 21 right in my motorcycle,

00:01:33.129 --> 00:01:35.129
doing about 75 miles an hour,

00:01:35.129 --> 00:01:38.129
because speed limits were for whims.

00:01:38.129 --> 00:01:40.129
I hit a park truck.

00:01:40.129 --> 00:01:41.129
I nearly died.

00:01:41.129 --> 00:01:42.129
And as a result,

00:01:42.129 --> 00:01:45.129
I now use this to walk.

00:01:45.129 --> 00:01:47.129
Two days prior,

00:01:47.129 --> 00:01:49.129
I actually had witnesses over.

00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:52.129
But then my aunt invited me to a special talk

00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:55.129
given by the Watchtower Society's president

00:01:55.129 --> 00:01:57.129
in San Francisco.

00:01:57.129 --> 00:01:59.129
And I said, OK, I'll see.

00:01:59.129 --> 00:02:00.129
Well, you can remember,

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:03.129
this time the drug culture was in full swing

00:02:03.129 --> 00:02:05.129
and it was part of my life, too.

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:07.129
And so I partied,

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:09.129
got home after 2 a.m.,

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.129
but I tried something.

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.129
I prayed to Jehovah.

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:14.129
I said, if you're real,

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:16.129
if this is true,

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.129
give me up in the morning.

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.129
Well, at 6 a.m.,

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.129
I woke up,

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:22.129
could not sleep,

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:23.129
and I thought,

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:24.129
this is really weird.

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:25.129
And so I thought,

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:26.129
I better go.

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.129
So I went with my aunt to this function.

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.129
And I thought,

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:31.129
if nothing else,

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:32.129
I'll just check out the chicks.

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.129
Hey, I was 21.

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.129
But you, when I found,

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:37.129
when I got there,

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:39.129
everybody paid attention.

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:40.129
When they,

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:41.129
brothers said,

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.129
to turn to a scripture,

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:43.129
they all turned to that scripture.

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.129
It was such a unified group

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:46.129
of harmony,

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.129
something that I always wanted.

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.129
So I made rapid changes in my life.

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.129
I soon qualified to go out

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:54.129
in the public preaching.

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:55.129
Soon after that,

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:56.129
I was baptized

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:57.129
and 6 months later,

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.129
I started in the full-time ministry.

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:02.129
And so for over 40 years now,

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.129
my wife and I have enjoyed this work

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:06.129
of going door to door

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:08.129
and teaching others the Bible.

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:09.129
In 1998,

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:10.129
I was dignified

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:11.129
with the opportunity

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.129
to serve as the Apostle Paul did,

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:16.129
visiting and encouraging congregations.

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:17.129
I've had the chance to do that

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:19.129
in different parts of the United States

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:22.129
as a traveling overseer.

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:23.129
So really, I've gone

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.129
from a life of pursuit

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:26.129
of happiness

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:28.129
and never found it.

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:29.129
I tried to make it happen,

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.129
but it wasn't there.

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:34.129
Now I have a life of purpose.

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:36.129
I have a family world wide

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:38.129
and I have a secure future.

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:39.129
What's better than that?
