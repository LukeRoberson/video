00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.549
Though I walk in the valley of deep shadow, I fear no harm.

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:45.149
For you are with me, and the fighting started again.

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.149
But the family that took us in was a gift from Jehovah,

00:00:49.149 --> 00:01:01.570
while we waited for the trains to start running again.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.569
We tried our best to help others.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:13.579
They're nearly finished. I'm going to go help them clean up.

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:24.250
Luda.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.250
Yakiv.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.250
I know her from school.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.250
This is my brother Pablo.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.250
He protects this whole area.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.060
I'm surprised you're still here.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.060
You too.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.060
Why? I stayed to help the fight.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.060
Where else would I be?

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.060
Oh, no. I just meant...

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.060
This is our home.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:56.900
Everybody has to do their part to support the war.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.620
I'm...

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.620
You're what?

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:08.770
Jesus Jehovah.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.770
They don't care about the country.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.770
Oh, the cowards.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.520
Your people?

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.520
Should be shot.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:27.439
Come on.

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:33.629
Let's go.

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:34.629
It just froze.

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:39.860
Fear is not true.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.460
We all get afraid.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.460
But let's look at what Jesus told us.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:56.389
However, when they hand you over,

00:02:56.389 --> 00:03:01.389
do not become anxious about how or what you are to speak.

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:06.389
For what you are to speak will be given you in that hour.

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:11.389
So, let's talk about what you can say

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:16.389
because when you have Jehovah's thoughts in here,

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:20.389
you will always give you the words when you need them.

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:34.979
Today is the day we'll try to leave.

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:37.979
We have brothers and sisters waiting for us.

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:41.979
After all these weeks, it may finally happen.

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:48.780
Have your tickets and ID ready!

00:03:48.780 --> 00:04:00.900
One at a time.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.900
Go ahead, I'm right behind you.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.900
Leaving the country?

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.900
Yes.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.900
Me, my mother, and my grandma are leaving.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.899
We're giving priority to the week and sick.

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:20.899
And there's a lot you can do here.

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:22.899
Don't you care about your country?

00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:36.939
I respect our country, but I am loyal to God.

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:40.939
I support God's kingdom first.

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:42.939
I think we make you stay.

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:44.939
Go back.

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:46.939
Hold on.

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:50.579
God's kingdom?

00:04:50.579 --> 00:04:54.879
Did you say God's kingdom?

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:59.639
My father, he was one of you.

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:09.639
I don't agree with your beliefs,

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:12.639
but I know you're good people.

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:20.120
So you and your family get on the train.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.120
Do not become anxious.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.120
For what you are to speak will be given you.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.120
I didn't know how Jehovah would do it.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.120
But I put my trust in him.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.120
And he showed me that I have nothing to fear.
