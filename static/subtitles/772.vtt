WEBVTT

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:08.050
He was buried with the kings, but he was not a king.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:14.449
He lived 130 years, but perhaps for the first 90 years of his life there is nothing recorded

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:16.690
what he achieved.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:22.289
And one major event that was recorded, he had to keep secret without others knowing for

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.250
about six years.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.449
Who is this man?

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.010
High Priest Jehoeda.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.929
What does Jehovah want you to know about him?

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:39.130
It is this, Jehoeda was loyal to Jehovah even without recognition from others.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:47.170
So the question to you is, if only Jehovah knows what you do and your loyalty, without

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.210
recognition from others, is that enough to sustain you in your loyalty?

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.210
For how long?

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.210
A year?

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.210
Two?

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.210
Six?

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.770
Longer?

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:07.659
Before you came to Gilead school, maybe it mattered more to you what others saw in you,

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.379
what they thought of you, your achievements.

00:01:11.379 --> 00:01:16.540
But in class, a deep study of the scriptures opened up your heart.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.659
You looked at attitudes and feelings and thoughts, perhaps hidden there for a long time.

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:28.900
You looked long and hard at the secret person of the heart, which is of great value in

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.540
the eyes of God, the inner you.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.500
And this drew you closer to Jehovah.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.700
You felt his reassuring love.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:45.180
Now more than ever, you realize how much Jehovah sees you and knows you.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.010
Do you not have the same thoughts as we find in Psalm 139?

00:01:51.010 --> 00:02:05.030
Let's read the first four verses, Psalm 139, oh Jehovah, you have searched through me.

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:07.109
You know me.

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:14.879
You know when I sit down and when I rise up, you discern my thoughts from afar.

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:20.560
You observe the way I travel and when I lie down.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.560
You're familiar with all my ways.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:32.599
There is not a word on my tongue, but look, oh Jehovah, you know it well.

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.759
You have joy that Jehovah knows you.

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:40.360
He always knew you, but now you know that he knows you.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.639
And you feel more secure in your relationship with him, less concern about recognition from

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:48.240
others.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.099
This was Hyper-East Jehovah.

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:59.740
Now he was born some years after King Solomon's Temple was completed in 1027 BCE.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:06.900
That means in his lifetime the nation of Israel split into leaving only the two tribe kingdom

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.460
using the temple.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.460
He saw kings of Judah introduce idolatry, sex worship.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.819
There were two good kings, Asa and Jehoshaphat.

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:24.180
But remember, Jehoshaphat had his son, Mary Jezebel's daughter, Athalia from the north,

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.659
and brought her wicked influence right into Jerusalem.

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:31.979
Things were going from bad to worse.

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:37.819
And in just a hundred years the temple was so neglected that it needed a major repair

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.699
just to be structurally sound again.

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:43.860
Meanwhile they built a temple for bail worship.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.020
And Jehoshaphat sees all this.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.180
Here he's an old man, the high priest.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.020
How did he keep his loyalty through those distressing years?

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.060
The Bible doesn't say.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.939
But Jehovah knows it all.

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:07.659
Your meditation, prayer, wouldn't he have to look at his own heart, his inner person?

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:12.419
Look at his attitude and his feelings towards pure worship?

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:20.139
Not becoming lax in standing for what is right, unlike high priest Eli when he got old.

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.779
And here Jehoshaphat is a man of authority, yet he doesn't step outside of the bounds

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:31.660
of his assignment, but he patiently waits on Jehovah.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:37.459
Well these years of loyal love helped him face a greatest challenge when he was old.

00:04:37.459 --> 00:04:41.620
And this he had to do without others knowing.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.939
What was that?

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:47.139
Well it's around 905 BCE.

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:54.259
And let's pick up the account in 2 Chronicles 22.

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:58.019
Here we find King Ayazaya of Judah has died.

00:04:58.019 --> 00:05:02.500
And then the unimaginable happens.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:08.129
2 Chronicles 22, we'll start at verse 10.

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:15.009
When Atholaya Ayazaya's mother saw that her son had died, she rose up and destroyed

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:21.670
the entire royal line of the house of Judah.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:26.350
Atholaya kills her own grandsons and makes herself queen illegally.

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:31.990
Now the Davidic line to the promised offspring is at risk of being cut off.

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.470
Let's read verse 11.

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:40.589
However, Jehoshabiyath, the daughter of the king, took Jehoash, the son of Ayazaya, and

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:45.350
stole him away from among the sons of the king who would have been put to death.

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.230
And she put him and his nurse in an inner bedroom.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.870
Who's Jehoshabiyath?

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.069
Read on.

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:59.529
As the daughter of King Jehorm, she was the wife of Jehoyada, the priest, and the sister

00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:02.170
of Ayazaya.

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:07.769
And she managed to keep him, the baby, concealed from Atholaya so that she did not put him

00:06:07.769 --> 00:06:09.769
to death.

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:14.209
He remained with him for six years hidden at the house of the true God while Atholaya

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:17.089
was ruling over the land.

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:23.730
For six long years, Jehoyada, Jehoshabiyath, and a nurse had a big secret, a small baby.

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.370
The last living air.

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:35.250
Now it's possible that this inner bedroom could have been a storage room at the palace.

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:40.329
And when it was safe, they smuggled the baby into a chamber in the temple.

00:06:40.329 --> 00:06:45.649
If that happened, imagine the risk, the timing would have to be perfect so they wouldn't

00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:47.889
get caught.

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:53.290
And in the temple for six years, do you think there were some close calls?

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:58.089
While at one point, Atholaya's own sons broke into the temple, stole items for bail

00:06:58.089 --> 00:06:59.089
worship.

00:06:59.089 --> 00:07:06.019
If that happened during this period, imagine if they saw the child, game over.

00:07:06.019 --> 00:07:10.620
This means that not once could Jehoyada or Jehoshabiyath let out their secret.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.939
They couldn't complain to others.

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:14.540
They couldn't give up.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.019
They couldn't give up.

00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:25.939
That means they had no recognition, no acknowledgement, no appreciation for their effort.

00:07:25.939 --> 00:07:33.620
That means they rely on prayer, looking to only Jehovah for support and reassurance.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:38.620
They would look to the scriptures like Psalm 139, oh Jehovah, you know me.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.939
You can hear them adapt it to their situation.

00:07:40.939 --> 00:07:45.139
You know that we're protecting the rightful king.

00:07:45.139 --> 00:07:47.019
And they're not just babysitting for six years.

00:07:47.019 --> 00:07:54.019
They're teaching the child to love Jehovah, love his law, be a good king for Judah.

00:07:54.019 --> 00:07:59.230
They would have to work unitedly as a couple.

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:00.470
And that brings us to her.

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:03.389
Let's talk about her for a moment, Jehoshabiyath.

00:08:03.389 --> 00:08:08.990
Clearly, Jehovah gives her the credit for saving her nephew, Jehoash.

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:10.829
But at this point, how old is she?

00:08:10.829 --> 00:08:19.430
Well, her father, King Jehorm, who died the year before was only 40 years old.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:21.829
So she is still quite young.

00:08:21.829 --> 00:08:26.509
And yet married to a man, some decades older than her.

00:08:26.509 --> 00:08:32.710
So here we have a young woman who is royalty married to a much older man who has a position

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:34.389
of high rank.

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:35.909
What's her angle?

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:37.990
Is she abusing her authority?

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:41.789
Is she trying to manipulate things like her stepmother Athalia?

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:49.470
No, she's risking her life to protect the rightful king in line with Jehovah's will, supporting

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:56.340
her husband and, apparently, without recognition from others.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:03.460
She reminds us of you, dear sisters, much of what you achieve may not be as noticeable

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.340
as your husband's achievements.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:13.620
And that could just be the nature of the assignment, which means you may get less attention.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:18.779
But you take pleasure in that Jehovah knows all that you do for him.

00:09:18.779 --> 00:09:22.460
And we love you for that.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:28.220
So you brothers, many things you do will be noticed.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:34.340
There may be some things where you won't get recognition, perhaps for a long time.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:38.940
And by the way, it's not wrong to get recognition.

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.860
As humans, we thrive on it.

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:45.860
And if you're ever in a position where you can recognize the good work or loyalty of

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:48.500
someone else, don't pass it up.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:49.980
Let them know.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.820
They appreciate it.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:59.820
However, your loyalty is based on not what others will see and know, but on the unseen.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:03.139
Loyalty from the heart.

00:10:03.139 --> 00:10:04.620
Remember Jeholyada.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:08.980
Yes, eventually everybody found out what he did, and he got honor.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:12.580
But what was the secret to his success?

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:18.379
Was it not in the years before the small things, the hidden things, the unseen, things only

00:10:18.379 --> 00:10:21.419
Jehovah knows?

00:10:21.419 --> 00:10:30.059
And name Jeholyada means, may Jehovah know how fitting, may Jehovah know all your loyal

00:10:30.059 --> 00:10:31.059
acts.

00:10:31.059 --> 00:10:35.820
Seen and unseen, and your father who looks on in secret will repay you.
