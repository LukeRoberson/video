00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.380
There you are.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.379
Did you both get the email survey sent?

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.379
You're both coming, right?

00:00:17.379 --> 00:00:18.379
I must have missed it.

00:00:18.379 --> 00:00:19.379
I was on calls all morning.

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:20.379
What's this about?

00:00:20.379 --> 00:00:22.379
The whole office is leaving early.

00:00:22.379 --> 00:00:28.379
We're going downtown to support the march for gay rights.

00:00:28.379 --> 00:00:30.379
She won't go.

00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:31.379
Why?

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:33.380
It's against our religion.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.380
Some of her people came by my house,

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.380
and when I asked,

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.380
they said your church won't support gay marriage.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.380
Irene?

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.740
It's true.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:48.740
As Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.740
we hold to the Bible standard on marriage,

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.740
which is only between a man and a woman.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.740
And we remain politically neutral.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.740
That's such ignorant thinking.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.620
I understand it's a sensitive subject.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.620
I have a daughter who deserves her rights.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.620
Trust me, Amber.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.620
As one of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.620
we believe everyone has a right to choose how they live.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.620
And I would never force my beliefs on anyone.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.620
But you won't go.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.620
Just as I would never force my beliefs on you,

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.620
all I ask is the same respect.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.620
And no, I won't be going.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.620
I have to go back to work.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:38.299
Look, obviously, Irene,

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.299
I don't agree with your perspective.

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.299
But I do appreciate that you're not pushing on anyone else.

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.299
Thank you.

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:59.659
Great discussion today, everyone.

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.659
Remember, midterms of this Friday, no excuses.

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.659
That includes you, Jordan.

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.659
You were noticeably silent during our discussion today, Olivia.

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:12.659
I was.

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:15.659
I guess I just didn't have much to say.

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.659
Aren't you concerned about gay rights?

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.659
Well, it seems like a political issue,

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:26.659
and I say neutral when it comes to political stuff.

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:29.659
But it's not a political issue.

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:31.659
This is a human rights issue.

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:34.659
Mr. Dallas, she's like crazy religious.

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.659
Hey, there's nothing wrong with it.

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:37.659
No, you don't understand.

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:40.659
Jehovah's Witnesses hate everybody that isn't straight.

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:42.659
That's not true. We don't hate anyone.

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.659
We're spoken with your people before.

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:47.659
They seem big on equality.

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:50.659
We are. The Bible says God isn't partial,

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.659
so we believe that everyone should be treated fairly.

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.659
Good.

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:01.659
So, I assume you have gay members in your church?

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:03.659
No, we don't.

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:10.150
But I thought you just said everyone should be treated equal.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.150
I'm confused.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.150
Yeah, call that.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.150
Jordan.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.150
Don't you have a class to get to?

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.150
As I was saying,

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.150
how is that not a little hypocritical?

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.150
Saying that you love everyone,

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.150
and then excluding certain people?

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:36.860
Honestly, Mr. Dallas,

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.229
I've wondered the same thing.

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:44.229
Okay.

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:46.229
And?

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:49.229
Well, I researched it in the Bible,

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:52.229
and I realized that God accepts all people,

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:54.229
but He doesn't accept all conduct.

00:03:54.229 --> 00:04:00.099
What does that mean?

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.099
It means that you can't be abusing drugs,

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:05.099
you can't be stealing,

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.099
or being violent,

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.099
and still be a witness.

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:14.099
There's just certain actions that God just doesn't accept.

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:22.110
Including how someone expresses their sexuality?

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.110
In some cases, yes.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.110
We follow God's standards,

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.110
not having sex without being married.

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.420
Well, if that's how you feel,

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.420
that's your right.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.420
Personally, it seems a tad archaic to me,

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:48.879
but to each their own.

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:50.879
Hey.

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:53.879
Does the Bible really say all that?

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:55.879
Yeah, it does.

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:58.879
Okay, maybe you could show me some time.

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:01.879
Yeah, for sure. Awesome.
