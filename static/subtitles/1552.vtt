00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:18.469
It was one of those mornings where everything seemed to be going right.

00:00:18.469 --> 00:00:22.469
In fact, this whole year was going right.

00:00:22.469 --> 00:00:28.910
Ever since I got baptized, my family is closer than ever.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.909
I've made some good friends in the congregation.

00:00:32.909 --> 00:00:35.909
I even started a Bible study.

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:40.909
It felt good to let go of my fears and serve Chahova with everything I have.

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:47.850
But things can change very quickly.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:01:02.539
I'm sorry. You know what? I think I saw Grayson over the weekend on Saturday.

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.540
I think he might be one of those people that tells us about the Bible, one of those up.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.540
You're saying Grayson is Chahova's witness.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.299
Yeah, let me go ask him.

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.299
Hey, Grayson.

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:14.299
Hey, what's going on?

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.299
Did I see you on Saturday morning over on Main Street?

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.299
Yeah, you know, I want to jump with witnesses.

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.299
And what we do, we go out. We talk to people.

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:23.299
I'm sorry.

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:24.299
I just don't get it.

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.299
You'll go knocking on stranger's doors to support your own religion.

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.299
Yeah, you won't stand and support this country.

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.299
Why don't you people get involved and make a real difference for once?

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:48.090
I was really disappointed in myself.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.090
I guess I hadn't moved past all my fears like I thought.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.430
Later that night, for family worship, we sat down and discussed our brothers

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.430
who were in prison for their faith.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.430
Mom, why are they in prison?

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.430
They didn't want to fight. They want to kill people.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.319
Really touched Aiden.

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.319
He was moved to pray for them that night.

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.319
His prayer touched my heart.

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.319
And with so much of my mind, I couldn't sleep.

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.319
So I decided to get up and do some research.

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.319
I found some information on the apostle Peter.

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:32.319
Despite his zeal, he also struggled at times with a fear of man.

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.319
Like when he denied Jesus three times.

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:41.689
But eventually, he all became that fear.

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:48.689
We strictly ordered you not to keep teaching on the basis of this name.

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:52.689
And yet look, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:56.689
and you are determined to bring a blood of this man upon us.

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:00.689
We must obey God as ruler rather than men.

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:03.689
The God of our forefathers raised up Jesus,

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:06.689
whom you killed, hanging him on a stake.

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.379
Always ready to make a defense before everyone

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:36.719
who demands of you a reason for the hope you have.

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:42.719
Peter focused on his hope, not his fear.

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:46.719
Just like these faithful brothers have been doing,

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:50.719
I want to be like them and make you're over-proud of me.

00:03:50.719 --> 00:04:05.889
The next day I woke up, I was thinking about the apostle Peter

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:08.889
and our brothers who were imprisoned for their faith.

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:16.819
And even though I was still a little nervous,

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:19.819
I felt ready to talk to Erk.

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:25.430
Yeah, you know, he does.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.430
So I didn't get a chance to explain of the day,

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.430
but if we have a moment now, I love the way they talk to you.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.060
I don't want to hear it.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.060
Sorry, Jason.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:41.649
And I thought that was it.

00:04:41.649 --> 00:04:42.649
But it wasn't.

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:46.220
Ron said he wanted to know more.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.939
Maybe I'll never completely get rid of my fears.

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:56.939
But my love for Jehovah and the example of his courageous servants

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:59.939
helps me be ready to meet the challenge.
