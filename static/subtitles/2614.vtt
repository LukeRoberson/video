00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:18.019
I'm Joy Allen and I'm a single sister and I'm in the first class of the school for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:34.689
We were just thrilled that the idea of being invited now when they raised the age limit and allowed us to apply.

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:39.439
We were just so thrilled.

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:47.439
But with the schools we've seen constant refinement from MTS to BSC and now the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:49.439
We've become much more visual.

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:54.439
We have historic presentations to help them with their spiritual heritage.

00:00:54.439 --> 00:01:02.490
We have workshops that help them to see how to really carry out their ministry properly.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.489
I feel better equipped to be a Kingdom Evangelizer.

00:01:06.489 --> 00:01:10.489
That Jehovah is really sat us down and showed us how to do it.

00:01:10.489 --> 00:01:16.489
So now I would like to express that genuine care for people as well and just be patient.

00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:21.219
But at the same time bold like Jehovah's.

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:26.219
I am so happy that single sisters are being accepted to attend this school.

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:34.219
It is an amazing privilege being able to see so many different aspects of Jehovah's personality with different class discussions.

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:37.219
The courses helped me as an Evangelizer.

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:41.219
I feel the urgent need to really go and preach.

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:48.219
Being selected to the first class of SKE was really, really amazing to me.

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:54.219
Jehovah was listening to my prayers and he said, okay, you can come.

00:01:54.219 --> 00:02:01.799
Living with our host family has been like a home away from home.

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.799
It's amazing how quickly you can feel like your family with somebody that you just met.

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:13.800
And they've gone out of their way to make us feel comfortable and make sure that we had what we needed so we could study and get the most out of the course.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:22.169
But it's just been nice to also have a friendship along the way.

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:29.169
I was nervous and anxious because of the English not being my first language.

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:34.169
But all those wars went away immediately.

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:41.169
Instructors were really loving and caring and classmates cheering for each other, supporting each other.

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:45.169
And Jehovah helped me through every step.

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:53.169
Proverbs 16, 16, the essence of it says that wisdom and understanding are better than silver and gold.

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:58.169
And the students came to school rich. They had gold.

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:02.169
Some of them got it because they were raised in the truth that was handed to them.

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:06.169
Some gold they gleaned from some surface study.

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:13.169
But what SKE did for the students is it taught them how to mine for gold.

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:22.169
So when they leave the school, they are delving into the Bible as they've never dug into it before.

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:29.659
And that will sustain them in any assignment they are given.

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:33.659
Oh, the students are ready for their assignments. No doubt about that.

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:36.659
They are anxious to get to the field.

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.659
They really want to get out there and apply what they have learned.

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:45.659
They want to do the work of an evangelizer and fully accomplish their ministry.

00:03:45.659 --> 00:04:00.099
We welcome into class number one of the revised curriculum.

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:09.099
And the name has been changed to school for kingdom evangelizers, which includes single brothers and sisters.

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:12.099
And this class has some single sisters along with a couple.

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.099
So this is some history here.

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.100
I would recommend this school to anyone who is in a position to accept it.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.100
It will strengthen your bond with Jehovah and with your brothers and sisters.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.100
And it's a beautiful gift and provision that he has made for all of us.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.100
A school like this is evidence.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:37.100
And we have almost a dozen schools functioning that are educating Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.100
We're big about education, but it's divine education.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:49.730
One thing we've learned is Jehovah can bless more than we can sacrifice.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:56.730
SKE is a beautiful manifestation of Jehovah's desire to bless each and every one of us.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.730
I highly encourage it.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:03.730
Stay grateful for the privilege of enjoying and set a good example.

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:09.730
Prove yourselves that you're better ministers than when you got here a couple of months ago.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:15.730
And you're better citizens of the kingdom now because of your divine education.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.730
First Corinthians 8.1 really helped us to see that this world today,

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.730
it may offer things, but knowledge puffs up.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.730
Love builds up in this course.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.730
We're built up.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:27.730
We're built up.

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:32.730
So I would say if you want, come, be built up by Jehovah.
