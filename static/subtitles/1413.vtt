00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:12.580
When I heard about the new publication to enjoy the life of a book, I was very nervous.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.820
It was change and sometimes I don't like change, but I know that it was for the best.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.660
I just needed to try it out.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.379
I didn't have a progressive Bible study in years, but the book, the way it was designed

00:00:28.379 --> 00:00:30.660
was to help me as a teacher.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.659
Once the features of this new publication were explained, it was going to help us to help our Bible students

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:43.659
begin preaching in the ministry, as well as helping our Bible students make changes in their everyday life.

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:49.170
And we were really excited about using those features to help our students to do so.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:57.170
I like the some people say section at the bottom of the lesson, because that helps prepare her for informal witnessing.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:04.170
It helps them to formulate in their own words how to defend their faith, or how to preach informally

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.170
or use those opportunities to share what they just learned.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:16.170
This was her way of learning how to feel comfortable talking to others about Jehovah and teaching others about Jehovah.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.170
You're right away from lesson one, lesson two, encouraging them to recognize that it's not just about what they're learning,

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.170
but it's also about what they can share with others.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.170
As the Bible teacher, it helps us to round out the rough edges so that when they do speak to others, it's tactful.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.170
You know, I put her in that place like, what would you say if someone told you that Jesus was God?

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.170
Like, how would you answer that question?

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.170
And that went to her heart and she was able to answer the question, well, I would tell them this.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.170
I would say this because that's exactly what happened.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.170
She was telling her family about the lessons that she was learning the things that she learned from the Bible.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.170
So all along, she was informal witnessing and not realizing that's what she was doing.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.170
So when you see that connection between what they're learning and how they can use what they learn,

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:13.310
it's just a wonderful feeling because you recognize that now they'll be able to teach somebody else.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:23.310
One thing that the book also does is that it progressively helps the student to make changes in their personal life in order to live by Jehovah's standards.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:31.310
The section review is a series of questions that usually has a key question or a key verse related to that lesson.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.310
So before going on to the next section, it's almost like a filter.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:42.310
It stops them, helps them the review and helps the teacher realize, hmm, they don't quite understand that point.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:51.310
They're excellent because they can get the expressions from your student where now you can really focus on what exactly are the issues that they're having.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.310
I was able to see if she had any great areas.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.310
If there was a problem or she didn't understand something.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:09.310
Are they saying the book says, or you taught me this, then you know, okay, they need to be reminded of the scriptures.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.310
And you need to see that truth a little bit deeper into their heart.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:22.560
That's where I saw my student express herself and let me know things she was thinking or things that were bothering her,

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.560
does she realize that she needed to make changes with?

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.560
The questions are a bit more personal than maybe you would have asked in the past.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.560
They're a bit more pointed than maybe we have the habit of asking.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.560
Comparing my questions I used in the past, what's in the enjoy life forever book?

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.560
I mean, I wasn't getting anywhere.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:51.560
These questions really help the students speak their heart and I'm so glad they're there.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:04:01.560
What takes time, it also takes patience and love on our part to let them make those changes so they can qualify to become an unbeatableized publisher.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:08.539
This publication, to enjoy life for a book, it's like no other.

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:14.539
It makes it much easier for them or you can help them much faster to get there.

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:19.540
That book has helped a lot. It definitely boosted my confidence.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.540
It was designed to just bring people right into the truth.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.540
Like she said, the book was me, especially for her.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:31.540
When the time came for her to do door-to-door ministry, she was ready.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.540
My student has already started several Bible studies.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.540
This study program has trained him now to be a Bible teacher.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.540
If you follow everything that's in the book, it's like a complete study.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.540
There's little that we can add ourselves. It's all there.
