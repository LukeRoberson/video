00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:04.780
To set this stage for the experiences in our program,

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.919
I'd like to talk to you for a few minutes on the theme,

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.019
invigorate your ministry, how?

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.060
You dear brothers and sisters are having a regular share

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.760
in the preaching work, and just think of the results.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.899
Each year, about two billion hours are spent in the ministry.

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:26.699
Millions of Bible studies are conducted,

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.539
and those being baptized number into the hundreds of thousands.

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:33.500
If you are a kingdom publisher,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.420
you have had a share in those thrilling statistics.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.420
But there's a potential danger with so much to do in our life,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.979
not just in the ministry,

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:48.939
but also with secular work, family responsibilities,

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:54.020
for some even health issues, we can get into a rut.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.780
It's not always easy to detect it first,

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.939
because in this age of technology, we always feel busy,

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:03.939
but what consumes our day?

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:06.939
Watch this one-minute video,

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:11.099
and try to detect what's going on in the life of one brother.

00:01:11.099 --> 00:01:13.379
His life is in a rut.

00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:14.980
Try to figure out why.

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.129
Would you say that this brother's life is in a rut?

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:34.930
Oh, he's active all day.

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:37.569
He always has something to do,

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.770
but it says if his mind has been kidnapped by his devices.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.210
Have you ever had the experience of reading an email

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.169
while someone is trying to tell you something?

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:51.689
It can be embarrassing when you realize

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:53.330
that they've asked you a question,

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.250
and they're waiting for an answer,

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.569
but you have no idea what they asked.

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.810
It's embarrassing, right?

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.650
But what if the person who is trying to speak to you

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:04.810
is Jehovah?

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.289
Even though we aren't doing anything wrong,

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:12.729
our daily routine can occupy our attention so much

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:17.729
that we are not able to hear the refreshing words of Jehovah.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.729
That can happen to any one of us.

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:24.849
Even our spiritual activity can get into a rut.

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:28.289
One Christian sister described it this way.

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:32.569
I would go out and serve us, go to meetings, study,

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.770
pray, but I did it all on automatic control,

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.930
never feeling anything.

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:42.889
Have you ever felt that way?

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.289
Do you see all the happy servants of Jehovah

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:48.969
whose experiences appear on JW Broadcasting?

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:53.050
And you say to yourself, why can't I find that joy?

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.169
Why is my ministry in a rut?

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:58.889
Perhaps you feel like a remote control train

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.610
that goes around and around on a track,

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.370
working the same territory with the same partner,

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.449
saying the same thing at each door.

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:12.330
Of course, there's nothing wrong with being in a good routine.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.290
But being in a rut can sap our energy

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.170
and take the joy out of our service.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.529
We can even come to view our ministry as boring.

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:27.970
Of course, we feel invigorated when we get good results.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.569
We meet an interested person going from door to door.

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:32.250
We're invigorated.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.649
And an active person approaches the cart

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:37.250
and wants to get in touch with the local congregation.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.089
We're even more invigorated.

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:40.930
We start a Bible study.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.209
We're on top of the world.

00:04:43.209 --> 00:04:44.610
I'm sure you'll agree.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.730
All those outcomes are good reasons for joy.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.050
The problem is that we're not always in control

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.250
of getting those outcomes.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.370
In real life, we may spend an entire morning

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.410
in the door to door work without meeting an interested person.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.529
We may spend months making return visits

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:06.529
without starting a study.

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:11.089
And once again, our ministry can get into a rut.

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:13.050
Now, don't misunderstand.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.610
It's not that we're doing anything wrong,

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.370
but we're not getting the full joy out of doing what's right.

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.290
Of course, Satan would love it

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.730
if our service to Jehovah were to fall into a rut.

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.290
He would love it if we lost our joy.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.810
If we lose our joy, we lose hope.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.730
We lose strength.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.889
And we might even begin to feel like giving up.

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:41.370
The point is this, brothers and sisters,

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.569
if you feel that your ministry has fallen into a rut,

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:48.649
don't be discouraged and don't give up,

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:51.769
there are ways that we can invigorate our ministry

00:05:51.769 --> 00:05:55.170
and serve Jehovah with renewed joy.

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:57.129
To illustrate that,

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:59.810
maybe you've had the frustrating experience

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.610
of locking yourself out of your house or apartment.

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.410
Of course, with a key, opening the door is simple.

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.569
A locked door might seem like an obstacle,

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:13.449
but it isn't if you have the key.

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:17.449
And the same is true with invigorating our ministry.

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:19.529
If we've fallen into a rut,

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:23.649
if we've lost that feeling of joy in our service,

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:28.529
there are a number of keys that can help us unlock the door.

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:29.529
Let's look at one.

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:35.529
Open your Bible to 1 Corinthians chapter 16, verses 8 and 9.

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.649
Now, in these verses,

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:42.850
the Apostle Paul was presented with the key of opportunity

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:45.970
and he used it to open a door.

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.850
1 Corinthians 16, 8 and 9 says,

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.610
But I am remaining in Ephesus

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.250
until the festival of Pentecost

00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:00.649
because a large door that leads to activity has been open to me.

00:07:01.649 --> 00:07:04.850
Here, the Apostle Paul found a key

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:08.329
and it didn't require moving to another location.

00:07:08.329 --> 00:07:12.290
In this case, the key was to stay where he was

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:16.410
but to take fuller advantage of an opportunity right before him.

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.610
Sometimes, the key to getting out of a rut in our ministry

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:26.370
is to take advantage of opportunities we have right where we are.

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:30.610
For example, have you considered auxiliary pioneering

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.009
or regular pioneering?

00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:35.009
What about learning a foreign language

00:07:35.009 --> 00:07:39.009
with the goal of helping a nearby group or congregation?

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:44.490
Opening one door often leads to other doors of opportunity.

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:48.930
For example, a brother named Jacob wrote this,

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:53.649
When I was seven, many of my classmates were Vietnamese.

00:07:53.649 --> 00:07:55.850
I wanted to tell them about Jehovah,

00:07:55.850 --> 00:08:00.050
so after a while, I made plans to learn their language.

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:03.209
For the most part, I learned by comparing the English

00:08:03.209 --> 00:08:06.209
and Vietnamese editions of the watchtower.

00:08:06.209 --> 00:08:11.209
I also made friends in a nearby Vietnamese language congregation.

00:08:11.209 --> 00:08:14.250
When I was 18, I started pioneering.

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:17.769
Later, I attended the Bible school for single brothers.

00:08:17.769 --> 00:08:20.970
This helped me with my present pioneer assignment

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:25.449
where I am the only elder in a Vietnamese language group.

00:08:25.449 --> 00:08:27.730
Many Vietnamese people are amazed

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:29.889
that I have learned their language.

00:08:29.889 --> 00:08:34.210
They invite me in and often I can study the Bible with them.

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:38.009
Some have progressed to baptism.

00:08:38.009 --> 00:08:42.769
The point is, our ministry is what we make it.

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:47.210
If we allow ourselves to remain in a rut, it will be boring.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:51.090
If we use our keys, if we take advantage of opportunities

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:55.090
that present themselves, we will invigorate our ministry

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:56.649
and give it new meaning.

00:08:57.529 --> 00:09:00.409
This doesn't always involve putting in more time

00:09:00.409 --> 00:09:01.769
in the ministry.

00:09:01.769 --> 00:09:05.450
It could mean that we simply make the best use of our time

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:09.610
as Ephesians chapter 5 and verse 16 says.

00:09:09.649 --> 00:09:14.970
In fact, there is a saying, don't work harder, work smarter.

00:09:15.809 --> 00:09:18.610
The key to working smarter could be as simple

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:20.649
as switching things up a bit.

00:09:20.649 --> 00:09:24.450
For example, could we work with different publishers

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.250
instead of the same one all the time?

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:30.129
Could we try a different approach to our presentation?

00:09:30.129 --> 00:09:33.649
Perhaps making better use of the Bible or our videos?

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:37.250
Could we engage in other aspects of the ministry

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:40.850
such as cart witnessing or phone witnessing?

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:44.210
Could we use our time more effectively to reach people

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:46.850
when they're most likely to be home?

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.570
Here's something else we could do to unlock a door

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:52.850
and invigorate our ministry.

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:57.850
Open your Bible to Acts chapter 16 verses 9 and 10.

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:03.889
Now here, the Apostle Paul found a unique way

00:10:03.889 --> 00:10:06.610
to unlock a door to greater joy.

00:10:06.889 --> 00:10:08.889
Acts 16, 9 and 10 says,

00:10:09.889 --> 00:10:13.730
And during the night, a vision appeared to Paul.

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:16.970
A Macedonian man was standing there urging him

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:21.970
and saying, step over into Macedonia and help us.

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:24.370
As soon as he had seen the vision,

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:26.850
we tried to go into Macedonia,

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:30.049
drawing the conclusion that God had summoned us

00:10:30.049 --> 00:10:32.370
to declare the good news to them.

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:37.289
Notice, Paul didn't think of all the reasons

00:10:37.289 --> 00:10:40.009
he couldn't step into Macedonia.

00:10:40.009 --> 00:10:43.450
No, he took action as soon as he was presented

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:45.330
with the opportunity.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:49.529
Paul unlocked the door to invigorate his ministry.

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:54.049
Sometimes we think that only those who are young

00:10:54.049 --> 00:10:57.450
can reach out to pioneer or to serve where they need us greater.

00:10:58.409 --> 00:11:00.730
But that's not always the case.

00:11:01.529 --> 00:11:04.330
You parents may be able to unlock a door

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:07.009
of opportunity for yourselves

00:11:07.049 --> 00:11:09.809
and think of the example you set for your children

00:11:09.809 --> 00:11:10.850
when you do so.

00:11:12.009 --> 00:11:15.850
That's what a mother named Tara discovered.

00:11:16.929 --> 00:11:19.809
I started pioneering when my youngest daughter

00:11:19.809 --> 00:11:22.929
was in elementary school, she says.

00:11:22.929 --> 00:11:28.090
It was important to me that my children see me serving Jehovah

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:32.730
to the best of my ability as I encouraged them to reach out.

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:36.330
Tara's husband, Anthony, saw the effect

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:38.289
that his wife's pioneering had.

00:11:38.289 --> 00:11:41.450
And in time, he too joined the ranks.

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.289
This is what he said.

00:11:43.289 --> 00:11:47.769
When Tara became a pioneer, it made an immediate impact

00:11:47.769 --> 00:11:50.850
on daughters number one and number two,

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:53.409
and they became pioneers.

00:11:53.409 --> 00:11:56.409
When I became a pioneer, daughters number three

00:11:56.409 --> 00:11:58.409
and number four followed.

00:11:58.409 --> 00:12:01.850
I wish I had pursued full-time service sooner

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:05.850
as it made a huge impact on the spirituality

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:06.850
of the family.

00:12:08.009 --> 00:12:10.169
I can relate to this experience

00:12:10.169 --> 00:12:13.730
because of the good example of my parents.

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:18.730
My mother was baptized in Canada in 1940 when she was 16.

00:12:19.889 --> 00:12:23.769
Jehovah's Witnesses had just been banned in Canada.

00:12:23.769 --> 00:12:25.850
Her father had already died

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:28.289
and her mother was opposed at that time.

00:12:29.049 --> 00:12:31.450
The brothers had very little money,

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:35.490
but they encouraged my mother to pursue spiritual goals.

00:12:35.529 --> 00:12:37.049
With that encouragement,

00:12:37.049 --> 00:12:40.090
she started pioneering in 1942,

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:42.769
while the ban was still on in Canada.

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:48.090
In 1947, she was invited to become a special pioneer

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:50.610
in the province of Quebec.

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:53.490
At that time, special pioneers were required

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:58.090
to spend 200 hours each month in the ministry.

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:01.809
With basically no money and no family support,

00:13:01.809 --> 00:13:04.330
she accepted that assignment.

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.730
This picture was taken when she and her pioneer partner

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:09.850
were boarding the train to Quebec.

00:13:10.809 --> 00:13:12.929
Whenever I see this picture,

00:13:12.929 --> 00:13:16.769
it reminds me of the intrepid spirit that my mother had,

00:13:16.769 --> 00:13:20.769
not being afraid to take on a challenging assignment

00:13:20.769 --> 00:13:23.570
but putting complete trust in Jehovah.

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:28.009
That spirit encourages me even to this day.

00:13:28.889 --> 00:13:31.409
My father has that same spirit.

00:13:31.409 --> 00:13:35.690
In the summer of 1976, when I was 11 years old,

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:39.690
a new arrangement was announced at our district convention,

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:41.970
auxiliary pioneering.

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:44.210
You could be an auxiliary pioneer

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:48.649
if you could devote 60 hours in one month to the ministry.

00:13:48.649 --> 00:13:53.250
The month of October, 1976, had five weekends.

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:56.330
My father encouraged our whole congregation

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:59.129
to try auxiliary pioneering that month.

00:13:59.169 --> 00:14:02.529
So many brothers and sisters, including me,

00:14:02.529 --> 00:14:05.610
decided to get a taste of pioneering.

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:09.809
It was a wonderful experience that I will never forget.

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:15.129
Parents, your good example will help your children

00:14:15.129 --> 00:14:19.289
to have a living ministry of their own that they will love.

00:14:20.289 --> 00:14:23.970
Brothers and sisters, if you find yourself in a rut,

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.370
there's no reason to stay there.

00:14:26.409 --> 00:14:30.529
We've discussed several ways to reinvigorate our ministry

00:14:30.529 --> 00:14:34.610
and with Jehovah's help, we will be successful.
