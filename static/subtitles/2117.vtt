00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:09.849
The first thing I must say is that I do not know Geova and that therefore I do not know the depth of his belief system.

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:18.850
However, professionally I have had the opportunity to know and work with the responsibility of the confession in Spain

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.850
and since then the relationship could not be better.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:33.850
Of course, my opinion in that sense has always been to meet me with a group of people.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.850
Very friendly and well, and that they have never given us from then on what is the job,

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.850
we have not had any difficulty to be able to work, to be able to relate to them.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.850
Well, I think that if the only extreme thing that I have seen from then on,

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.850
in people I have been able to relate to, that is his amability and his education.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:01.850
In absolute, I have seen activities that could be far from considered as extremists.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.849
In Spain, in fact, their situation is more than consolidated since many years ago,

00:01:06.849 --> 00:01:12.849
they have recognized a peculiar situation, as is the recognition of the Reigo Notorious in Spain,

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:18.849
that gives them access to a more favorable legal regime, precisely because of that condition,

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:25.849
among which we can highlight the fact that they can celebrate religious matrimony with effective civilians,

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:31.849
that is to say that the state has in that sense maintained a relationship of trust with the confession

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:36.849
and from the point of view of where I can know, or I can know, have not been produced,

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:41.849
whether they are penal, or penal actions, or denunciations, respect the confession,

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:48.849
in terms of the realization of activities that could be considered as extremists or illicit in our country.

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:52.849
Well, because of the international standards that are established in these same conventions,

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:58.849
to which we have made mention, and especially the jurisprudence, especially the European human rights

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:04.849
that has been occasionally pronounced on the right of religious freedom

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:13.849
and, in particular, has already had a chance to pronounce, in terms of what affected the Russian respect of many other confessions,

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.849
but also of the texts of Jehovah.

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:23.849
Well, from the sentence with Nesof, in the year 97, the last sentence of the year 2014,

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.849
passing through the 2010 sentence, which was precisely precisely to the prohibition

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.849
of the C of the Jews of Mosque.

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.849
Well, in those sentences, specifically, the European Tribunal,

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:43.849
established at least two principles, which should have been, as a parameter,

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:50.849
at the time of solving this issue, which affects, specifically, the prohibition of the activities of the confession.

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:57.849
And what would be, first, that the state of being neutral and impartial front to religious beliefs?

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:04.849
And second, that as a consequence of this, the citizens in the collective dimension,

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:10.849
in the collective exercise of their right, have guaranteed that the state will not ingest,

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.849
in a way illicit, or in a way arbitrary, in its activities.

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:20.849
That is, the principle of neutrality guarantees the separation of what is the state,

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.849
what is the phenomenon of religion, what are the laws or religions in general?

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.849
Separation that implies autonomy for the religious concessions,

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.849
does not ingest by part of the state of its internal organization or its activities.

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:42.849
Well, I think that the reaction should be the one that has already been produced in some forums,

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:44.849
which is how we are seeing it.

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.849
There has been a specific manifestation of the IHF,

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:56.849
the IHF, where specifically is considered the application of this normative of this legislation

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.849
for the prevention of extremist activities, which is thought to be a context

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:05.849
that nothing has to do with the activities of religious entities, such as commotals.

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:10.849
Well, the dangers that can attract the excessive application,

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:14.849
we could say, of this legislation, which has, as we said before,

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:20.850
to apply this normative to any kind of beliefs that could be considered

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.850
for any reason to be considered extremist.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.850
In fact, in 2010, when in the European Union of Human Rights,

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:35.850
it was pronounced on the subject of the co-creation of the Moscow regime

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.850
and it was considered that the events that had motivated the prohibition

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:48.850
of this entity were arbitrary and we are not sufficiently justified.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:56.850
It is insisted again to take the prohibition to limits that happen

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.850
with a lot of the normative in which it is thought,

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.850
in which it is thought, originally,

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.850
and therefore, the reaction of the international organizations

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.850
and democratic states should be the defense of religious freedom

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.850
of all citizens in this case, also of the Russian citizens.
