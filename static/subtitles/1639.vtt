00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:17.989
Have you or a loved one faced a medical emergency or prepared for a serious medical procedure?

00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:22.269
If so, you know how stressful that can be.

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:27.910
Psalm 41 3 promises that Jehovah will sustain us on our sick bed.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.910
How does he do this?

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.869
Not through miraculous cures, but by lovingly providing physical, emotional, and spiritual

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:37.869
support.

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:41.869
One means of support is the hospital liaison committee arrangement.

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:48.950
Today, more than 16,000 brothers serve on or coordinate some 2,000 liaison committees around

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.750
the world.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.829
How do they assist?

00:00:53.829 --> 00:01:00.630
Our role is to help doctors and Jehovah's Witnesses to come to a consensus on how to treat

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.789
the patient without breaking God's law.

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:09.989
Once we visited a big hospital with 2 other brothers, and when we went in, we had 25

00:01:09.989 --> 00:01:16.950
doctors waiting for us, and more doctors were listening through a conference call.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.790
When we stepped into the auditorium, one of the doctors said to us, now you have entered

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.790
a lion's den.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.750
Well, that was not an easy start.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.950
We were able to present our hospital presentation, answered their questions, and provide some

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.829
medical articles.

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:42.629
These are medical articles that are carefully screened and reviewed by a panel of doctors

00:01:42.629 --> 00:01:45.629
for accuracy, for credibility.

00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:48.390
Those are the articles that are provided to the hospital liaison committee, brother,

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:57.709
to show to the doctor, to try and persuade him or her that this is a valid and effective

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:02.430
treatment strategy to use that can avoid blood transfusion.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.030
Now doctors understand patients can make their own choices regarding blood, and I have

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:15.150
to respect the choices patients make, and they now understand that they can treat patients

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.349
now without the use of blood.

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:25.110
Our surgeons got incredibly fantastic about doing procedures differently, advanced technology

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.310
to do procedures that now didn't require blood transfusion.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.469
We embraced the idea that we should treat respectfully the wishes of the Jov's witness

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:34.870
patients.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.550
Serious medical situations are stressful, and decisions often need to be made quickly,

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.270
including those involving blood.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:49.430
The hospital liaison committee arrangement provides comfort and help at the right time.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.750
For the past year, I've been going through an extremely difficult trial.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.030
There were some false starts and misdiagnosis, but we finally got diagnosed about a year

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.590
ago that I had a soft-a-geal cancer.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:08.310
I know that Jehovah, in this present evil wicked system of things, won't stop his finger

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.750
and say, cancer be gone, I know that.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.830
And I've never asked him for that, or prayed for that.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:23.310
But what I have prayed for is comfort, not only myself, but for my family.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.550
It's an answer to my prayer.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.469
I pray for help, and they show up.

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:38.080
He has delivered tenfold what would be expected.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.120
Jehovah will sustain him on his sick bed.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.360
During his sickness, you will completely change his bed.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.840
Sometimes there's a sick patient in bed fighting for their life, and they're surrounded by

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.879
family and friends, and the strongest person in the room is the person in the bed.

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:58.120
And it's this scripture being fulfilled.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.120
Sometimes they're the one encouraging everyone else.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.840
They're the ones telling everyone else, don't cry, it's going to be okay.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.360
Everything's going to be fine, and that's Jehovah sustaining them on their sick bed.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.639
Receiving the benefits from the HLC, from my times in the hospital, makes me believe

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:18.720
something about the HLC is that's very special.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.839
It's all based on love.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:26.639
It's based on love, first and foremost for Jehovah, and appreciation for what he's given

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:36.160
us, the health that we have, and to be privileged to receive that love, and to give that love,

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.680
is a privilege that I will never forget.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.720
Each of us also plays a vital role by doing two important things.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:52.600
First, by having a current completed simplified durable power of attorney, DPA card.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:58.519
Second, in advance of any medical procedure, ensure your doctors will support your health

00:04:58.519 --> 00:05:02.139
care decisions.

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:07.100
How grateful we are for the hospital liaison committee arrangement and the thousands of

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.939
brothers working tirelessly on our behalf.

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:15.180
This is truly evidence of Jehovah's loving interest and care.
