00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:23.579
Billions of people have died throughout history, but the death of one person stands alone â€“ that of Jesus Christ.

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:35.579
Why did he die? Did his death have a purpose? To find the answer, we need to go back to the beginning of human history.

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:43.579
The Bible explains that God created the man Adam perfect without sin.

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:49.579
He was free to eat from all the trees in the Garden of Eden except one.

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.579
God gave the simple command not to eat from that particular tree.

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:00.579
This tree symbolized God's right to set the standards of good and bad.

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:10.120
As long as Adam remained obedient to Jehovah, he had the prospect of living forever on a paradise earth.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.120
But Adam did not appreciate all the good things God had done for him.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:24.659
He chose to disobey God. As a result, he lost the opportunity to live forever.

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:33.659
But he was not the only one affected. All of his descendants have inherited the fatal effects of sin.

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:42.659
By themselves, humans could not break free from sin and death. They needed someone to rescue them.

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:49.659
For this reason, Jehovah miraculously caused one of his perfect spirit sons to come to earth as a human.
