00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:05.790
Our worldwide brotherhood is truly special.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.689
When our brothers are in need, we want to help in whatever way possible.

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:15.189
It also brings us great joy to be with our brothers, whether at meetings,

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:18.690
the field service, or on other occasions.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.190
We love our brothers and enjoy spending time with them.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.690
At the same time, because we are all imperfect,

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.690
our love and unity will be tested.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.190
We may have our feelings hurt.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.689
Or, we may hurt the feelings of others.

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:39.689
That brings me to the theme I would like to discuss with you in this month's program.

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:44.689
Settling differences brings Jehovah's favor.

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:47.689
It is based on Matthew 6.14.

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:50.189
Let's read this important verse together.

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:53.490
Right after teaching his disciples how to pray,

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:59.000
Jesus says in verse 14,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
For if you forgive men, their trespasses,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.500
your Heavenly Father will also forgive you.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.000
Do what extent do Jesus' words affect how Jehovah views

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.299
what we do each day and our worship to him?

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.299
Consider this.

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.000
You're concluding your day in prayer.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.400
You pray for Jehovah's name to be sanctified.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.000
You pray for his kingdom to come.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.700
You ask that he bless the governing body and the brothers taking the lead.

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.599
You share with him a few matters of personal concern.

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:32.700
And then you say,

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.099
Jehovah, I know I'm imperfect and I sinned against you often.

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:41.000
Please forgive me for my sins.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.140
Let me stand before you in a clean and approved state.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.040
Now, the question is,

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.040
has Jehovah heard your heart felt request?

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.540
Will he forgive you?

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.739
Well, what did Jesus say?

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:00.640
Look again at verse 14.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.739
For if you forgive men, their trespasses,

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:07.439
your Heavenly Father will also forgive you.

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.439
Did you notice Jesus' use of the word if?

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:14.840
That tells us that forgiveness is not automatic.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.340
It comes with a condition or price.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.039
What price?

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:20.740
According to Jesus,

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.639
if we forgive others,

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:24.740
the condition has been met.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.439
The price has been paid.

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:29.740
What will Jehovah do for us?

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.340
Jesus said he will also forgive you.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.340
Really though,

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.439
is it fair or reasonable for Jehovah to say to us,

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:41.340
only if you forgive others

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.439
than I will also forgive you?

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:48.740
Well, suppose you get very sick and lose your job.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.039
You're unable to pay rent for many months.

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:54.340
Your situation is desperate.

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:57.939
You have very few of any options.

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:01.240
You worry about your wife and your children.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.939
Say you go to the owner of the house

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:07.639
and ask if he would give you time to get back on your feet.

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:10.840
Once you get better and are able to work again,

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.740
you will do everything within your power

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.639
to pay him what you owe.

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:17.939
He tells you not to worry.

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:20.639
He understands your situation.

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.539
He will cancel your debt.

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:24.639
And you do not have to pay him any rent

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.939
until your situation improves.

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:29.939
In fact, he'll cover your monthly expenses

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:34.139
until you're able to care for your family.

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:37.139
How would you feel about what he has done?

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:41.439
And would this affect how you treat others?

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:43.840
Well, because of our sinful nature,

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.639
we are all in debt to Jehovah, deserving of death.

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:51.139
We are unable to cover our expenses.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.740
But when we go to Jehovah in prayer

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.039
and beg for his help

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:59.039
and his great mercy and kindness,

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:01.439
he tells us not to worry.

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:05.240
He has given the life of his son to pay our debt.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.139
And on the basis of that sacrifice,

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:10.939
he is willing to cover our expenses,

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:13.039
the sins we commit daily

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:14.840
and to extend forgiveness to us

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.240
until we're able to get back on our feet

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.759
when we reach perfection in the new world.

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:25.560
So think again about those simple yet powerful words

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.360
of Jesus at Matthew 6.14.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.360
Pray if you forgive men their trespasses,

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.860
your Heavenly Father will also forgive you.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.759
Is that fair?

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:39.759
Is that reasonable?

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:41.759
Is it realistic?

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:43.759
Without a doubt?

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:45.660
In fact, settling differences

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.660
or forgiving others freely

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.459
is one of the best ways

00:04:49.459 --> 00:04:51.860
to imitate Jehovah's compassionate

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.360
and merciful nature.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.360
What can help us to settle differences quickly?

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.959
The first thing we should do is

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:04.560
to try and let love cover over the wrong.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.860
Can I just forgive and forget?

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.759
If we're able to do so,

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:11.160
this is a beautiful way

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.759
to maintain the congregation's peace and unity.

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:18.560
But if we're struggling to forget the wrong,

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.860
there are two scriptures

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.259
that are especially helpful

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:24.360
in this matter of settling differences.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.459
They are Matthew 5, 23 and 24

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:32.399
and Matthew 18, 15 through 17.

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:34.500
Keep in mind that these texts

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.600
are not referring to the same scenarios

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.399
nor are they to be applied in the exact same way.

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:46.000
Matthew chapter 5 has a broader application

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and can be used to bring peace in most situations.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.800
Matthew chapter 18 has a more limited application

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.699
and applies to specific situations

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:01.699
that are more serious in nature.

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:03.800
Now let's consider the first text,

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.100
Matthew 5, 23 and 24.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.399
If then you're bringing your gift to the altar

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:11.500
and there you remember

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.300
that your brother has something against you,

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.699
leave your gift there in front of the altar

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:18.399
and go away.

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:21.000
First, make your peace with your brother

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.500
and then come back and offer your gift.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.100
To truly capture what these two brief verses

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.399
mean for you and me today,

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:32.100
we have to understand what Jesus words meant

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.899
in his first century Jewish listeners.

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:37.300
Picture the scene in your mind

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.899
as we transport ourselves

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:43.199
in the city of Jerusalem some 2,000 years ago.

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:46.199
It is during one of the annual festivals.

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:49.800
There are tens of thousands of people in the city.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.500
You are there to make your sacrifice a beautiful lamb

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.300
the best one you have.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.399
It's clean and unblemished.

00:06:58.399 --> 00:07:00.899
You take the lamb through a series of courts

00:07:00.899 --> 00:07:03.500
all the way to the court of priests.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.500
It has taken you most of the day to get there.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.699
Now you're ready to put your hands on that animal

00:07:09.699 --> 00:07:12.199
and offer a prayer for forgiveness

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:14.300
and then you remember something.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.800
What?

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.699
Verse 23 reads,

00:07:18.699 --> 00:07:21.600
if then you are bringing your gift to the altar

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.500
and there you remember that your brother

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.899
has something against you.

00:07:25.899 --> 00:07:27.399
Now you think,

00:07:27.399 --> 00:07:30.699
my brother does have something against me.

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:32.399
The last time I saw him,

00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:34.699
he greeted everybody else but me.

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:37.600
He was upset, but what is it?

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.000
I don't remember doing anything.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
He is so sensitive.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:46.430
He's always upset with something.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.529
Did Jesus have all of that in mind

00:07:48.529 --> 00:07:51.329
when he said what he did in verse 23?

00:07:51.329 --> 00:07:52.730
No.

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:57.529
He did not go into detail about what that something might be.

00:07:57.529 --> 00:08:00.730
He doesn't say who is right or wrong.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:04.230
He doesn't make a comment about whether someone is too sensitive,

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:07.129
always getting upset, never satisfied,

00:08:07.129 --> 00:08:09.329
difficult to get along with.

00:08:09.329 --> 00:08:11.029
Why not?

00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:13.829
Because the reason behind the something

00:08:13.829 --> 00:08:16.629
is not the important thing.

00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:19.230
What is the important thing?

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:22.430
That the peace has been disturbed.

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:25.730
There is a difference that needs to be settled.

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:27.930
A lack of peace between brothers

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:30.730
could affect their relationship with Jehovah.

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:33.330
That is important.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.029
So what should be done?

00:08:36.029 --> 00:08:39.429
We see the answer in verse 24.

00:08:39.529 --> 00:08:42.029
Leave your gift there in front of the altar

00:08:42.029 --> 00:08:43.730
and go away.

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:46.330
First, make your peace with your brother

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:49.230
and then come back and offer your gift.

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:51.830
That animal sacrifice is important too.

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.029
There's no doubt about that.

00:08:54.029 --> 00:08:56.629
It represents worship to Jehovah

00:08:56.629 --> 00:08:58.230
like going to the meetings

00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:59.629
in the field service,

00:08:59.629 --> 00:09:02.029
sharing and family worship.

00:09:02.029 --> 00:09:06.230
But according to Jesus, what is more important?

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.529
It is settling the difference,

00:09:09.529 --> 00:09:12.529
making peace with our brother first,

00:09:12.529 --> 00:09:15.629
then we will be in an acceptable position

00:09:15.629 --> 00:09:19.529
to offer our gift of worship to Jehovah.

00:09:19.529 --> 00:09:24.509
Yes, settling differences will bring Jehovah's favor.

00:09:24.509 --> 00:09:28.809
But when can we apply the principle of Matthew 5?

00:09:28.809 --> 00:09:32.110
Whenever there is a difference to be settled?

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:35.110
Perhaps our brother misunderstood what we said or did

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:37.710
or maybe he didn't misunderstand.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:41.009
Maybe we did give him a valid reason to be hurt.

00:09:41.009 --> 00:09:46.009
Regardless, we notice that he has something against us.

00:09:46.009 --> 00:09:49.509
In that case, we make peace.

00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:52.210
We can also use the principles of this text

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:56.809
when we are hurt or have something against our brother.

00:09:56.809 --> 00:09:58.809
We can take the initiative ourselves

00:09:58.809 --> 00:10:01.009
to settle misunderstandings,

00:10:01.009 --> 00:10:05.009
to resolve differences and to make peace with our brother.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:08.610
Again, Jehovah blesses such a spirit.

00:10:10.409 --> 00:10:13.610
Now open your Bible to Matthew chapter 18.

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:18.909
We mentioned earlier that it has a more limited application.

00:10:18.909 --> 00:10:20.509
How so?

00:10:20.509 --> 00:10:22.509
Notice verse 15.

00:10:24.009 --> 00:10:27.110
Moreover, if your brother commits a sin,

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:30.809
go and reveal his fault between you and him along.

00:10:30.809 --> 00:10:34.610
If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:38.710
Here Jesus says, if your brother commits a sin,

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:43.110
that is much different than just having something against us.

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:46.909
We are talking about a situation that is much more serious.

00:10:46.909 --> 00:10:49.009
What situation?

00:10:49.009 --> 00:10:53.110
The revise organized to do Jehovah's will book page 136

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:57.710
explains that it involves financial or property matters

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:01.909
such as failing to repay a loan or committing fraud.

00:11:01.909 --> 00:11:04.610
Are the offence might be slander,

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:07.409
which seriously affects someone's reputation?

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:10.909
Of course, there are sins that could be resolved

00:11:10.909 --> 00:11:13.409
between the individual's concern,

00:11:13.409 --> 00:11:16.509
but are also serious enough to merit expulsion

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:19.009
from the congregation if not settled.

00:11:20.509 --> 00:11:23.210
Before we start applying Matthew 18.15,

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:26.509
we should first consider whether it is really necessary

00:11:26.509 --> 00:11:28.009
to pursue the matter.

00:11:29.009 --> 00:11:31.009
Could we simply forgive the individual

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:33.809
for what was done or even take the loss

00:11:33.809 --> 00:11:35.710
if it were a financial matter?

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:38.509
That is a personal decision.

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:43.210
If we decide to pursue the matter, what do we do?

00:11:44.309 --> 00:11:47.110
Jesus helps us in verse 15 when he says

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:51.909
that we reveal his fault between the two of us alone.

00:11:51.909 --> 00:11:54.509
We do not discuss the matter with others,

00:11:54.509 --> 00:11:57.610
attempting to get them to side with us.

00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:59.309
We do not go straight to the elders

00:11:59.309 --> 00:12:02.110
and try to get them to solve the problem for us.

00:12:02.909 --> 00:12:06.009
No, we try to resolve the matter between us.

00:12:06.509 --> 00:12:09.509
And since our goal is to settle the difference,

00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:12.309
maintain our relationship with Jehovah

00:12:12.309 --> 00:12:14.809
and help our brother do the same,

00:12:14.809 --> 00:12:17.909
we make repeated efforts to speak with him

00:12:17.909 --> 00:12:20.509
when our initial efforts are unsuccessful.

00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:23.809
Keep in mind that Jesus did not say

00:12:23.809 --> 00:12:26.809
go only once and reveal his fault.

00:12:29.139 --> 00:12:30.639
When applying this first step,

00:12:30.639 --> 00:12:33.740
make it clear that your motive is to gain your brother.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.039
Also, it would be helpful to clearly state

00:12:37.039 --> 00:12:38.740
that you are applying the first step

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.440
in settling differences

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.840
as outlined by Jesus at Matthew 1815.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:47.340
Of course, this would be stated in a kindly,

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:49.539
non-threatening manner,

00:12:49.539 --> 00:12:51.940
but still in a way to show the seriousness

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:56.059
of getting the matter settled.

00:12:56.059 --> 00:12:58.259
What if the first step in gaining your brother

00:12:58.259 --> 00:12:59.559
is unsuccessful?

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.860
Notice first 16 explains step two.

00:13:05.059 --> 00:13:06.960
But if he does not listen,

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.159
take along with you one or two more

00:13:09.159 --> 00:13:13.059
so that on the testimony of two or three witnesses,

00:13:13.059 --> 00:13:15.759
every matter may be established.

00:13:15.759 --> 00:13:19.559
Yes, we talk with him in the company of one or two more.

00:13:19.559 --> 00:13:22.360
Would that be our best friends?

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.960
No, the whole purpose is to gain our brother.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.259
Heaming up with two of our best friends

00:13:28.259 --> 00:13:30.059
could alienate our brother.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.860
Instead, it makes sense

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:36.460
that we would choose other mature Christians.

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:38.559
How would mature Christians be helpful?

00:13:39.559 --> 00:13:42.659
Well, are we misunderstanding things?

00:13:42.659 --> 00:13:46.059
Could they help him to reason about the matter?

00:13:46.059 --> 00:13:47.960
Could a solution be found?

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:52.059
Having spiritually mature witnesses there

00:13:52.059 --> 00:13:53.960
may help to resolve the matter.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:57.360
Generally, applying steps one and two

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.159
will result in gaining your brother

00:13:59.159 --> 00:14:03.960
in preserving the peace of the congregation.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:07.159
If he does not respond to these repeated efforts

00:14:07.159 --> 00:14:08.960
to help him, then what?

00:14:10.259 --> 00:14:11.960
You have a decision to make.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.759
Are you willing to forgive your brother?

00:14:15.759 --> 00:14:19.159
Even take a loss if a financial matter is involved?

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.259
If you choose to pursue the matter further,

00:14:23.259 --> 00:14:27.059
listen to Jesus' words recorded at verse 17.

00:14:28.059 --> 00:14:30.159
If he does not listen to them,

00:14:30.259 --> 00:14:32.559
speak to the congregation.

00:14:32.559 --> 00:14:35.659
If he does not listen even to the congregation,

00:14:35.659 --> 00:14:39.059
let him be to you just as a man of the nations

00:14:39.059 --> 00:14:40.659
and as a tax collector.

00:14:41.659 --> 00:14:44.159
At this point, the body of elders

00:14:44.159 --> 00:14:47.860
representing the congregation will get involved.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:49.860
They will review the facts of the case

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:52.059
and determine if a judicial committee

00:14:52.059 --> 00:14:54.059
should be appointed.

00:14:54.059 --> 00:14:57.559
Happily though, these situations are rare

00:14:57.559 --> 00:14:59.960
and matters are often resolved peacefully

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.460
before reaching such a serious point.

00:15:04.059 --> 00:15:07.360
Think back again to that heartfelt prayer to Jehovah.

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:11.460
Has Jehovah heard our sincere requests?

00:15:12.159 --> 00:15:13.360
Will he forgive?

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:17.360
Well, at this moment, if you realize

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.360
there is a difference with your brother

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.259
that needs to be settled,

00:15:21.259 --> 00:15:23.960
pray to Jehovah about the matter.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:27.460
Ask him to help you see beyond the emotion

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:28.960
and make peace.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.960
Do not let any more time go by.

00:15:34.169 --> 00:15:36.269
Once we have followed the simple steps

00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:39.470
outlined by Jesus and have forgiven others,

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:41.970
the condition has been met.

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:43.470
The price has been paid.

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:47.070
Then what will Jehovah do for us?

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:50.470
Jesus said he will also forgive us.

00:15:51.169 --> 00:15:52.470
As a result,

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:54.269
we will gain the peace of mind

00:15:54.269 --> 00:15:56.870
that comes with a clean conscience

00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:00.669
knowing that we have Jehovah's favor in blessing.

00:16:00.669 --> 00:16:03.669
We can then make a valuable contribution

00:16:03.669 --> 00:16:06.570
to the beautiful United Brotherhood

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:08.870
that we are privileged to be a part of.
