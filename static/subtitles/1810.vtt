00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:07.839
We've now invited brother and sister Ortiz from New Britain, Connecticut to visit our studio.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.679
Brother Ortiz serves as an elder and as a regular pioneer.

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:17.280
He's had many additional privileges of service over the years, and Lynette has been

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.760
regular pioneering for over six years.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.960
However, the reason we wanted to talk with them is that thus far,

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.359
they have successfully countered Satan's attacks on their family.

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:32.240
We'd like to hear how they accomplished this.

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:36.479
First of all, Freddie, tell us a little bit about your family.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.439
You know, Lynette and I were raising the truth.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.399
However, we met and we felt in love.

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:45.679
At that time, marriage was not for me.

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:50.880
So we started a romantic relationship for two years before we started attending to the first

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.960
meeting at the Kingdom Hall. So now after we started starting the Bible, we took two

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.079
studies per week and we knew that this is what the truth.

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:02.159
But also, we learned that Jehovah held Jehovah's Seas in Marari.

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:04.400
So we needed to do some changes.

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.719
Lynette's parents won her to continue with her education.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.439
So we needed to change our behavior.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.359
So two years after, we did change the changes.

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:19.200
Number one, because we didn't love Jehovah.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.120
And the two, because we loved what we were learning, it was worth it.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.599
To follow the Bible principles.

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.680
So two years later, we got married and we got baptized and then we got married.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.480
Very good.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.000
So Lynette, you were raised without an knowledge of Jehovah God.

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:41.280
What changes did you both have to make to ensure your own family would have a

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.840
fine foundation and be successful?

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.480
Well, prior to our baptism, Freddie had a serious drinking problem.

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:53.760
And based on the way we were raised, there was a lot of jealousy going on.

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:57.359
And I would say, like of confidence and trust in each other.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.879
My Bible teachers, thankfully, suggested us to study the book,

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:04.719
making your family life happy.

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:08.000
And we ended up studying that book twice.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.319
The publication and the Bible principles in it became the foundation of our wonderful marriage

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.800
and the happy family we enjoyed today.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.000
Very nice.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.599
So Freddie, maybe you can tell us about your children and what they're doing with their lives now.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.159
We have two sons, Gabriel.

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:27.120
He's the oldest one.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.400
He started regular pioneer where he was 14 years old.

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:33.840
At 18, he was appointed as ministerial servant.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.520
22 years old, he's been working at the plumbing department at the Warwick construction

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.479
for more than two years.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.280
Adrian, he's now 18 years old.

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:46.960
And he also started regular pioneer when he was 14.

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:51.360
Currently, he handled the account for the congregation and other privities as well.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.319
Well, they both have had an early start in their theocratic careers that's commendable.

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:00.319
I'm sure you're both proud of them.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.840
And we're confident that Jehovah, the one to whom every family owes its name,

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.680
is pleased that they're giving an answer to his taunter.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:17.199
In addition to the family lifebook, what else contributed to the success your family has experienced?

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.680
Lynette.

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:24.159
The governing body has provided with so many publications with directions for families,

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:26.080
of course, always in Jehovah's word.

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:31.520
So we decided early on that whenever a question or an issue came up,

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:35.120
we will not make any decision based on impulse.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.759
Instead, we will research it in the publications.

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:45.759
We pray to Jehovah for him to give us wisdom and we even pray for him to guide us to find

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:49.439
the right time to talk to each other or to counsel the boys.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.240
I have always heard that there were stages on the shelf life and personality development.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.360
So I research it in advance as to what to expect.

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:07.039
In that way, we were not surprised when we saw changes in attitudes or ideas.

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:12.560
And that helped us realize what needed to be addressed or corrected,

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:16.800
as opposed to what was normal for that stage in the boys' life.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:18.800
Very practical.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.399
Freddie, what can you add?

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:25.040
Over the years, I have learned how essential it is to become a good listener,

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:26.879
also understanding.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.720
I tell my family how much I love them every day because we never know

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.160
when circumstances by change.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.680
Family worship is very important for us.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.120
I know it's easy to put off.

00:04:37.519 --> 00:04:39.120
But the benefits are hard to meet.

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:42.560
Well, before this arrangement started,

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:47.519
as a family, we value the Bible study with a family.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.360
I learned that a fetus is six months.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.120
He can recognize family's voice.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.920
So I started a Bible study with my son when they were still under womb.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.240
And continue to do so after that.

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:09.120
I know that secular work and other activities can block

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.160
to the regular program, but we need to find that tendency.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.920
And we want to succeed in family worship.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.279
Very good.

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:20.959
Well, it seems your efforts paid off when we consider how

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:23.360
well your family's done spiritually.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.639
In the close relationship you have with each other.

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:30.879
Now, in that, it sounds as if the family is perfect.

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:33.759
No challenges.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.600
Is that the case?

00:05:36.079 --> 00:05:37.120
No, not at all.

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:43.600
First Corinthians 1013 says that Christians will face challenges that are common to them.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.920
And we have faced the normal challenges that comes with race in a family.

00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:55.360
The same verse indicates that if we do things Jehovah's way,

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.160
we may increase the opportunity for him to make the way out for us.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:06.720
One unexpected challenge that has changed our family dynamics over the years now

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:11.199
was when Freddie was diagnosed with cancer in 2012.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.600
The treatment was aggressive and took its toll on his health.

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:18.959
Our whole lifestyle changed.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.319
We had to move out from our house to an apartment.

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:32.399
We gave away our dogs' bike and we had to wash our expenses really closely to keep going.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:41.279
This could have put a lot of strain in our family and our marriage and in spirituality.

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:46.959
But again, by praying to Jehovah constantly and applying by both principles,

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:51.600
I can say my marriage and my family has never been better.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:59.040
Spiritually, we kept our routine and we all stay in full-time service throughout the ordeal.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.720
The boys have cooperated very well.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.519
They have offered to work to give us money.

00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:13.360
But we prefer for them to keep focused in the kingdom because we are confident that Jehovah

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.519
will add on to the things we need.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.120
Freddie has been a great example for all of us because he pushes himself

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.439
to keep his spirit to our routine.

00:07:24.399 --> 00:07:27.199
You never see him complaining or in a bad mood.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.360
And that has been very inspiring for the rest of the family.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.519
It's quite a story.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:40.800
You folks will certainly relate to the convention drama video that was advertised on our April program.

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:45.279
Freddie, we're very sorry to hear about your physical condition.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.959
Are there any favorite scriptures that you've used to help keep you going,

00:07:50.959 --> 00:07:52.639
spiritually and stay strong?

00:07:53.519 --> 00:07:56.560
There are many of them, just to mention a few.

00:07:57.279 --> 00:08:03.279
Philippians chapter 4, 6 and 7 have been my life since 2012.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.839
I have to pray to Jehovah constantly so he can give me the strength that I need

00:08:08.319 --> 00:08:10.800
to overcome my health.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:17.680
And also, Philippine says that he will give us peace of mind.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:24.879
In addition, he will safeguard our heart and that's something I've been seeing from Jehovah.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:33.360
Also, Isaiah 41, 10, stay that does not be anxious for I am your God.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.879
Those words give me confidence that he will keep on helping us in these circumstances,

00:08:38.879 --> 00:08:41.120
of these different circumstances in our life.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.200
I do understand them.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.759
I have a lot of responsibility in the household.

00:08:45.759 --> 00:08:53.679
So I had to rewrite Proverbs 31 verse 10 to 31 and the way they describe all the responsibility.

00:08:53.679 --> 00:08:57.519
A good wife might have to shoulder for the family.

00:08:57.519 --> 00:09:00.240
So brother Maurice, she's been Proverbs 31 wife.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.559
A good wife for sure.

00:09:04.799 --> 00:09:08.559
Obviously, showing how much you love and respect each other, that's commendable.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.600
And you're focused on being the best parents you could be.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.519
He's a good example for parents viewing the program at this time.

00:09:16.879 --> 00:09:19.200
This will come as a surprise to you.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:25.200
But we'd like to invite your two sons out to see what they remember from growing up in the family.

00:09:27.039 --> 00:09:29.360
We have Gabriel and Adrian with us.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:37.779
Mom's getting a little teary eyes.

00:09:37.779 --> 00:09:39.059
I understand.

00:09:39.059 --> 00:09:40.259
It was a surprise to see.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.980
So Gabriel, since you're the oldest,

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:47.539
we'll start with you.

00:09:48.899 --> 00:09:50.820
What do you remember about your family life?

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.940
First in Puerto Rico and later here in the United States.

00:09:55.059 --> 00:10:00.019
I remember faithfully going to all the meetings and going out on service every Saturday.

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:01.620
That was just the routine.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:04.980
In Puerto Rico, my dad had to work a lot though.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:10.340
And like he said before, that's easy to get in the way of a good family worship routine.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:15.700
But I can honestly say, once we made that transition and moving over here,

00:10:16.259 --> 00:10:18.899
that helped us to have a good family worship routine.

00:10:19.539 --> 00:10:22.659
And it has helped us to get closer and closer each day.

00:10:23.379 --> 00:10:26.980
And now Adrian, anything you can add about the home life?

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:31.139
Yeah, my mom and dad have always shown a great love for Jehovah,

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:32.820
but also for each other.

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.259
So as kids, you could just sense that.

00:10:36.899 --> 00:10:39.379
So love and respect is what we've always known.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.460
Even now that my brother and I are older,

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.700
we have a great bond with each other.

00:10:44.179 --> 00:10:46.820
We love each other and we could tell each other everything about our lives.

00:10:47.299 --> 00:10:50.179
And as due to that love and respect that they have shown.

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:52.659
And even if there are disagreements,

00:10:52.659 --> 00:10:56.019
which there's always going to be disagreements because it's an imperfect family,

00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:00.100
but that love is always there to bridge those differences.

00:11:01.059 --> 00:11:06.500
I also like to add something that helped me a lot was a routine that my dad and I had.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:08.980
Right before I'm going to school,

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.340
we would always read the daily texts and he would always say behave.

00:11:13.059 --> 00:11:15.139
And remember that Jehovah loves you.

00:11:15.779 --> 00:11:21.620
And I don't think he knows how much that really helped me go through every day challenges at school.

00:11:22.259 --> 00:11:23.220
That's priceless.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.379
Now, very nice observation.

00:11:27.379 --> 00:11:34.740
I'm interested in understanding what prompted you to regular pioneer when you're only 14 years old.

00:11:35.539 --> 00:11:37.460
It was at a point where my dad lost his job.

00:11:38.179 --> 00:11:40.419
Rather than stressing about it, worrying about it,

00:11:41.299 --> 00:11:43.700
he looked at things with a spiritual perspective.

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:45.779
So he started to pioneer.

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:49.139
And since our schedules match perfectly,

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:51.139
I was his little pioneer buddy.

00:11:51.139 --> 00:11:53.460
I would go out on service with him whenever he needed it.

00:11:54.179 --> 00:11:58.100
And I feel like if the spiritual families focus on spiritual matters,

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.500
it helps them to come closer.

00:12:01.139 --> 00:12:05.779
And I can't imagine how our relationship and respect for one another can be any

00:12:05.779 --> 00:12:06.820
better than what it is now.

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:08.419
Very nice.

00:12:09.139 --> 00:12:12.419
Adrian, you began pioneering when you were 14 as well.

00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:15.620
How do you think that affected you as a person?

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:19.460
Well, first of all, the reason why I started pioneering

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:22.659
was because I was going out in service with the rest of my family.

00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:25.460
And since they were already pioneering, I was getting the time in.

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:30.259
But I do think that taking on the responsibility of getting

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:36.659
at least 70 hours a month in the service does make you think differently

00:12:36.659 --> 00:12:38.340
and 14 than it would have otherwise.

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.940
I think it has helped me mature spiritually,

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:45.460
and it has contributed to me being used in my full potential in congregation.

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.539
And honestly, I wouldn't trade it for anything.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.539
Well, maybe going to Bethel.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.379
I gave you back to you.

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:58.659
Tell us what was it like when you learned that your dad had a serious health problem

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.580
and would not be able to provide for the family like he used to?

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.580
It was probably one of the biggest challenges I have ever faced.

00:13:07.539 --> 00:13:10.659
When my dad got diagnosed with cancer, it was about the same time

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.539
that I got my call to Bethel.

00:13:14.259 --> 00:13:16.179
And I was torn, I was divided.

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:22.019
I felt like if I was to go to Bethel now, it would be selfish of me to leave my family

00:13:22.019 --> 00:13:22.899
at a time like that.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:27.139
But my family always had a spiritual view on things.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:30.659
Insighting scriptures like Matthew 633 constantly

00:13:30.659 --> 00:13:33.620
helped me to see if as a whole, as a family.

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:37.220
We put Kingdom interest first that Jehovah was going to provide

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:39.220
because he's a loving father and friend.

00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:42.340
And then my dad lost his job.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:44.259
And again, all these feelings came up.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:51.059
But my family was adamant that let me know that the congregation had been taking care of them

00:13:51.059 --> 00:13:51.940
for months now.

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:56.500
And then doing some simplifying on their own helped them as well.

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.019
And I didn't have to worry about anything.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:02.659
I do know that there's a scripture that says that we got to take care of our own.

00:14:02.659 --> 00:14:05.860
So I do anything I can to help my family back home.

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:12.340
The only thing I hope is that I can have a good faith like they've shown

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:14.740
through these difficult times.

00:14:16.259 --> 00:14:18.899
Well, thank all of you for joining us.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:24.899
I think all of us are feeling that emotion and feel very close to you for sharing that.

00:14:24.899 --> 00:14:29.379
Now, as a father, I can appreciate all that Freddy's trying to do is

00:14:29.379 --> 00:14:30.259
head of the family.

00:14:30.899 --> 00:14:36.179
And on that, your support beyond normal is very much to be commended.

00:14:37.059 --> 00:14:40.580
And we can tell your family is thriving spiritually and

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:43.139
we pray Jehovah continue to bless your efforts.

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:44.659
Come with me.

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:51.220
And we thank you, Gabriel and Adrian, for your surprise to the studio.

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:54.659
Thank you very much for taking the time to be

00:14:54.659 --> 00:14:55.299
interviewed.

00:14:55.299 --> 00:14:56.259
Thank you for the food.

00:14:56.259 --> 00:14:57.059
Thank you.
