00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.469
Welcome to our update.

00:00:04.469 --> 00:00:09.150
How did the 2023 annual meeting affect you?

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.830
Remember the information that highlighted Jehovah

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.470
as the merciful judge of all the earth?

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.390
We were thrilled to learn that individuals who died

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.269
in the flood of Noah's day,

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.030
in the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah,

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.870
and even some who might repent during the great tribulation,

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.550
could benefit from Jehovah's mercy.

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:32.390
Since hearing that information,

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.950
have you found yourself thinking a lot about Jehovah's mercy?

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.789
Well, so has the governing body.

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:44.789
In our prayerful study, meditation, and discussions,

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:48.429
we've focused our attention on how Jehovah has dealt

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:51.990
with people who engaged in serious sin.

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:55.509
In this update, we'll briefly consider

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:59.270
the pattern Jehovah set in the Bible record.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.909
Then we'll discuss some new information

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:05.349
regarding the way we'll handle cases of wrongdoing

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:07.150
in the Christian congregation.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.349
Second Peter 3, verse 9,

00:01:11.349 --> 00:01:15.829
tells us that Jehovah does not desire anyone to be destroyed,

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:20.549
but desires all to attain to repentance.

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.750
What does that teach us?

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.109
It helps us understand that Jehovah wants people

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:29.709
to repent and gain life.

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:32.150
When the first human couple rebelled,

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.150
they condemned the human race to sin and death.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.310
What did Jehovah do?

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.230
He took immediate steps to help as many

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.989
of their descendants as possible to gain life.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.269
Through the sacrifice of Jesus,

00:01:49.269 --> 00:01:51.909
Jehovah arranged to cover the sins

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.189
of all who would exercise faith and repent.

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.349
Such ones can live forever.

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:03.390
So it's not surprising that throughout the Bible record,

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.989
we find Jehovah appealing to sinners to repent.

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:11.669
He urges those who had strayed from true worship

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:13.590
to return.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.870
This is in harmony with Romans 2, verse 4, which says,

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.310
or do you despise the riches of his kindness

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.349
and forbearance and patience

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.990
because you do not know that God in his kindness

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.430
is trying to lead you to repentance?

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.990
Consider some examples in which we see

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.590
Jehovah trying to lead sinners to repentance.

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.870
Cain showed murderous hatred for his brother Abel,

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.430
but Jehovah reached out to Cain

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:49.270
and tried to reason with him.

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:51.710
When David sinned,

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.830
Jehovah used the prophet Nathan

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.870
to lead David to repentance.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.870
And what about the nation of Israel?

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.550
Jehovah kept appealing to them,

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.430
even when they showed no desire to repent.

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.509
At Ezekiel 33 11,

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:11.789
Jehovah appeals to the nation of Israel

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:14.870
as surely as I am alive.

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:18.870
I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked,

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.750
but rather that someone wicked changes his way

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.750
and keeps living.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.909
Turn back, turn back from your bad ways

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:32.949
for why should you die, O house of Israel?

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:35.189
What does this teach us?

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:37.550
That while Jehovah doesn't force anyone

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.310
to repent of his sins,

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.310
he has demonstrated great compassion for imperfect humans.

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:48.110
He's gone to great lengths to make forgiveness possible,

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.669
to appeal to sinners

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:55.349
and to lead them to repentance if at all possible.

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.949
What a compassionate and merciful God we worship.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.990
The governing body has prayerfully considered

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.189
how Jehovah's mercy could be better reflected

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:10.509
when dealing with wrongdoers in the congregation.

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:13.310
And that's led to a clearer understanding

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.349
of three scriptures.

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:17.629
Let's consider the first.

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:22.629
It's 2 Timothy 2 verses 24 and 25.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.949
Their Paul said,

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:28.589
for a slave of the Lord does not need to fight,

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:31.350
but needs to be gentle toward all,

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.790
qualified to teach, showing restraint when wronged,

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.790
instructing with mildness, those not favorably disposed.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.389
Perhaps God may give them repentance

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:48.069
leading to an accurate knowledge of truth.

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:51.029
To whom was Paul referring when he mentioned

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:53.550
those not favorably disposed?

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.629
A study note on 2 Timothy 2, 25, explains.

00:04:59.829 --> 00:05:03.310
Paul uses a Greek word that in this context

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.870
refers to people who resist Christian teachings

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.350
or who place themselves in opposition to them.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.949
Paul may have had in mind, among others,

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:16.750
those in the congregation in Ephesus

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.149
who had a negative attitude

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:21.990
toward following scriptural counsel

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.750
or heeding admonition from brothers taking the lead.

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.430
Today, this could include brothers and sisters

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.470
in the congregation who disregard scriptural counsel

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.149
and become involved in serious wrongdoing.

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:39.829
Someone who gets involved in serious wrongdoing

00:05:39.829 --> 00:05:42.029
needs help from the elders.

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:45.829
So a committee of elders meets with the wrongdoer.

00:05:45.829 --> 00:05:49.269
The goal of these elders isn't merely to judge

00:05:49.269 --> 00:05:51.829
whether the wrongdoer is repentant,

00:05:51.829 --> 00:05:56.829
but also to act in harmony with 2 Timothy 2, 24 and 25.

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.389
The elders must correct and instruct the wrongdoer

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:04.310
with mildness.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:05.670
What is their goal?

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:11.110
Notice what another study note on 2 Timothy 2, 25 says.

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:14.990
When a Christian elder mildly corrects

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.910
or instructs those not favorably disposed,

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:23.910
the good result may be repentance or a change of mind.

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.310
The credit for such a change in thinking and attitude

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.829
goes not to any human, but to Jehovah

00:06:30.829 --> 00:06:35.149
who helps the wayward Christian make this vital change.

00:06:35.149 --> 00:06:38.269
Paul goes on to mention some of the beautiful results

00:06:38.269 --> 00:06:40.110
of such repentance.

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.189
It leads the sinner to a more accurate knowledge

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:44.589
of the truth.

00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:48.069
It helps him come back to his proper senses

00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:52.870
and it enables him to escape from Satan's snares.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.629
So the elders have the goal of leading the wrongdoer

00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:58.470
to repentance.

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:03.470
How does a clearer understanding of 2 Timothy 2, 24 and 25

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:05.709
adjust our current arrangement?

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:08.790
Presently, a committee of elders

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:12.709
normally meets with a wrongdoer only one time.

00:07:12.709 --> 00:07:15.509
However, the governing body has decided

00:07:15.509 --> 00:07:18.189
that the committee may decide to meet with the person

00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:19.790
more than once.

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:20.310
Why?

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:25.790
At Revelation 2, 21, regarding that woman Jezebel,

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:29.870
Jesus said, I gave her time to repent.

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:34.470
We hope that through the loving efforts of the elders,

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.870
Jehovah will help a wayward Christian

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:41.069
to come back to his proper senses and repent.

00:07:41.069 --> 00:07:44.829
If he repents, the committee will provide shepherding

00:07:44.829 --> 00:07:48.430
so that the person can escape from Satan's snares

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:52.350
and keep making straight paths for his feet.

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:54.990
This arrangement reflects the same effort

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:58.269
that Jehovah personally made to help David

00:07:58.389 --> 00:08:00.790
and the nation of Israel to repent.

00:08:02.069 --> 00:08:04.189
What about baptized miners,

00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:06.870
those under 18 years of age,

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:09.389
who engage in serious wrongdoing?

00:08:10.509 --> 00:08:12.629
Under our current arrangement,

00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:16.389
such a baptized miner, along with his Christian parents,

00:08:16.389 --> 00:08:18.509
must meet with a committee of elders.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:22.670
Under our new arrangement, two elders will meet

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.670
with the miner and his Christian parents.

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:28.709
The elders will find out what steps the parents

00:08:28.709 --> 00:08:33.350
have already taken to help their child come to repentance.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:36.590
If the miner has a good attitude and the parents

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:40.190
are reaching him, the two elders might decide

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:44.309
that it isn't necessary to take the matter any further.

00:08:44.309 --> 00:08:46.909
Of course, the elders will occasionally check

00:08:46.909 --> 00:08:49.389
with the parents to make sure that the miner

00:08:49.389 --> 00:08:52.070
is getting the help he needs.

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:55.230
However, what if a baptized miner

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:58.950
unrepentantly persists in a wrong course?

00:08:59.909 --> 00:09:04.110
In that case, a committee of elders would meet with him

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.029
along with his Christian parents.

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.389
The governing body is confident that these adjustments

00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:15.389
reflect Jehovah's desire to lead sinners to repentance.

00:09:15.389 --> 00:09:17.950
He wants them to come to their senses

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:20.830
and escape from the snare of the devil.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:24.269
He does not desire anyone to be destroyed,

00:09:24.269 --> 00:09:27.909
but he desires all to attain to repentance.

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:31.590
Let's move on to our second scripture.

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:35.909
It's 1 Corinthians 5, 13, which says,

00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:39.590
remove the wicked person from among yourselves.

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:44.549
The Bible clearly teaches that an unrepentant wrongdoer

00:09:44.549 --> 00:09:47.990
should be removed from the congregation.

00:09:48.029 --> 00:09:51.269
And really, it's a consequence that the wrongdoer

00:09:51.269 --> 00:09:52.789
has chosen.

00:09:52.789 --> 00:09:54.350
Why so?

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:58.750
Because he refuses to respond to repeated loving attempts

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:02.230
by the elders to lead him to repentance.

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:05.429
Even when the elders inform a person

00:10:05.429 --> 00:10:08.110
that he's being removed from the congregation,

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:10.710
he won't be left hopeless.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:14.750
The committee will not simply explain what steps he can take

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:17.269
to be welcome back into the congregation.

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:19.590
What else will they do?

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:23.309
The elders will explain that they'd like to meet

00:10:23.309 --> 00:10:26.389
with the individual again after a few months

00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:29.429
to see if he's had a change of heart.

00:10:29.429 --> 00:10:32.149
If the individual is willing to meet,

00:10:32.149 --> 00:10:35.149
the elders will make a warm appeal

00:10:35.149 --> 00:10:37.789
for him to repent and return.

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:42.830
What about individuals who were disfellowshipped in the past?

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:44.710
Perhaps even many years ago?

00:10:45.549 --> 00:10:48.470
In some cases, they may not even recall the reason

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:50.190
they were disfellowshipped.

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:53.429
They may have abandoned their wrong course years ago.

00:10:54.309 --> 00:10:57.190
The governing body has decided that the elders

00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:00.710
should visit such ones, pray with them,

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:05.070
and make a warm appeal for them to return to the congregation.

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:08.350
If a person's been away from the congregation

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:13.350
for many years, he would no doubt be very weak spiritually.

00:11:14.029 --> 00:11:17.669
Therefore, if such a person is willing,

00:11:17.669 --> 00:11:20.990
the elders could arrange for him to have a Bible study

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:23.870
even before he's reinstated.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:27.029
Of course, the individual would have to want to return

00:11:27.029 --> 00:11:30.669
to the congregation, and the elders would always be

00:11:30.669 --> 00:11:33.190
the ones to arrange for such a study.

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:39.149
In imitation of Jehovah's mercy toward imperfect sinners,

00:11:39.149 --> 00:11:43.350
we want to reach out and help as many as possible

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:46.190
to know that the door is open for them

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:48.470
to come back to the congregation.

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:54.590
If you are a disfellowshipped person listening to this update,

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:58.509
we urge you to accept the efforts of the elders

00:11:58.509 --> 00:12:02.070
to help you return to the congregation.

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:04.429
If you're living in an area where you don't know

00:12:04.429 --> 00:12:07.990
the local elders, please feel free to call

00:12:08.029 --> 00:12:10.230
or visit the local kingdom hall

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:13.350
and request spiritual assistance.

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:17.830
Jehovah wants you to come home and we do too.

00:12:19.549 --> 00:12:22.269
In keeping with the scriptural admonition

00:12:22.269 --> 00:12:25.190
at 1 Corinthians 5-11,

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:28.750
when a person has been removed from the congregation,

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:31.669
we stop keeping company with that person,

00:12:31.669 --> 00:12:34.830
not even eating with such a man.

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:37.149
That means we don't socialize

00:12:37.149 --> 00:12:40.549
with those who are removed from the congregation.

00:12:40.549 --> 00:12:44.070
However, that does not mean that a Christian

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:46.830
could not invite a disfellowshipped person

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:49.669
to attend a congregation meeting.

00:12:49.669 --> 00:12:53.070
That disfellowshipped person could be a relative

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:58.070
a former Bible student or someone we were close to in the past.

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:03.029
How appropriate this adjustment is at this time

00:13:03.029 --> 00:13:06.909
as we're preparing for the most important meeting of the year,

00:13:06.909 --> 00:13:11.669
the memorial, which will be held on Sunday, March 24th.

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:14.710
What if a disfellowshipped person

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:16.669
comes to a congregation meeting?

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:19.509
Under our current arrangement,

00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:21.710
we don't say a greeting to individuals

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:23.990
who've been removed from the congregation.

00:13:24.909 --> 00:13:28.230
However, the governing body has decided

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:32.029
that publishers can use their Bible-trained conscience

00:13:32.029 --> 00:13:34.830
to decide whether to give a simple greeting

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:37.389
and welcome a disfellowshipped individual

00:13:37.389 --> 00:13:39.429
who attends a congregation meeting.

00:13:40.549 --> 00:13:45.929
Hi, so good to see you here.

00:13:45.929 --> 00:13:50.240
Thank you.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.159
While we wouldn't have an extended conversation

00:13:53.159 --> 00:13:56.080
or socialize with such a person,

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:59.799
we do not need to ignore him completely.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.240
That brings us to our third scripture.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.840
It's 2 John 9-11.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:08.840
There we read.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.919
Everyone who pushes ahead

00:14:11.919 --> 00:14:14.960
and does not remain in the teaching of the Christ

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.480
does not have God.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.840
The one who does remain in this teaching

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:23.039
is the one who has both the Father and the Son.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:27.440
If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching,

00:14:28.279 --> 00:14:30.960
do not receive him into your homes

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.559
or say a greeting to him.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.759
For the one who says a greeting to him

00:14:35.759 --> 00:14:38.159
is a shareer in his wicked works.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:43.399
But doesn't 2 John 9-11 tell us not to say a greeting

00:14:43.399 --> 00:14:46.720
to anyone who's been removed from the congregation?

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.720
In examining the context of those verses,

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.879
the governing body has concluded

00:14:52.879 --> 00:14:56.960
that the Apostle John was really describing apostates

00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.559
and others who actively promote wrong conduct.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.519
For good reason,

00:15:02.519 --> 00:15:04.879
John strongly directed Christians

00:15:04.879 --> 00:15:07.639
not even to greet such a person

00:15:07.799 --> 00:15:10.679
because of his contaminating influence.

00:15:11.519 --> 00:15:14.600
Therefore, if a disfellowship individual

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.679
is a known apostate

00:15:16.679 --> 00:15:20.279
or someone who actively promotes wrongdoing,

00:15:20.279 --> 00:15:23.000
the elders would not visit him,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.320
neither would individual Christians greet such a person

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:30.000
or invite him to attend a congregation meeting.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.000
In this update,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.720
we've examined Jehovah's desire

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.600
to lead sinners to repentance,

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:42.320
and we received clarification on three scriptures

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.559
that relate to how wrongdoers should be dealt with.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:50.679
In Harmony with 2 Timothy 2, 24 and 25,

00:15:50.679 --> 00:15:53.879
a committee of elders will lovingly correct

00:15:53.879 --> 00:15:56.159
and instruct a wrongdoer

00:15:56.159 --> 00:15:59.799
with the goal of leading him to repentance.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:04.080
As outlined at 1 Corinthians 513,

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.960
a person who refuses to repent

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.279
must be removed from the congregation.

00:16:10.279 --> 00:16:12.720
However, the committee will still try

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:16.600
to help him see the need to repent and return

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:20.080
and will arrange for a follow-up meeting in a few months.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.200
We also clarified our understanding

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.679
of 2 John 9 to 11,

00:16:25.679 --> 00:16:29.720
which we learned applies specifically to apostates

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:33.559
and others who actively promote wrong conduct,

00:16:33.559 --> 00:16:37.720
not to all those who have been removed from the congregation.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.799
Ever since the first human couple sinned,

00:16:41.799 --> 00:16:46.360
Jehovah has been working to rescue repentant humans.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.120
Of course, Jehovah isn't permissive

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:52.360
and he doesn't shield unrepentant wrongdoers

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:55.679
from the consequences of their actions.

00:16:55.679 --> 00:16:58.440
Still, in his love,

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:02.039
Jehovah wants sinners to become reconciled to him

00:17:02.039 --> 00:17:04.079
if at all possible.

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:07.119
He doesn't want anyone to be destroyed,

00:17:07.119 --> 00:17:09.880
so he appeals to them to repent.

00:17:10.799 --> 00:17:15.599
Elders are privileged to be fellow workers with Jehovah

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:20.079
as they work to help sinners come to repentance.

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:24.039
Our love for Jehovah continues to deepen

00:17:24.039 --> 00:17:29.039
as we meditate on his love, mercy and compassion.

00:17:30.039 --> 00:17:32.680
We know you'll be happy to hear

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.640
that the information contained in this update

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:38.559
will be published in a series of articles

00:17:38.559 --> 00:17:43.000
that will appear in the study edition of the Watchtower.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.319
In addition, the elders will receive direction

00:17:46.319 --> 00:17:49.240
on how to apply this information.

00:17:50.119 --> 00:17:55.119
May Jehovah bless us as we work to implement these arrangements

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.319
that reflect his love and mercy.

00:18:00.359 --> 00:18:02.920
Before we conclude, the governing body

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:06.119
has asked me to read the following announcement.

00:18:07.559 --> 00:18:09.680
The governing body has decided

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.640
that sisters may choose to wear slacks

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.240
when participating in the ministry

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.519
and when attending Christian meetings,

00:18:17.519 --> 00:18:20.759
assemblies and conventions.

00:18:20.759 --> 00:18:24.720
If a sister chooses to wear slacks on such occasions,

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:29.720
they should not be casual but dignified, modest and appropriate.

00:18:31.839 --> 00:18:34.400
When a sister has a part on the program,

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.400
she should wear a skirt or a dress

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.279
if that is the standard of dress in that land.

00:18:41.279 --> 00:18:45.400
Of course, some sisters may choose to wear a skirt or a dress

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.200
even when they do not have a part on the program.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:52.960
In addition, brothers may choose not to wear a tie

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:56.400
or a jacket when participating in the ministry

00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:01.400
and when attending Christian meetings, assemblies and conventions.

00:19:02.079 --> 00:19:04.640
If a brother chooses not to wear a tie

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.400
or a jacket on such occasions,

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:11.759
he should dress in a manner that is appropriate, modest

00:19:11.759 --> 00:19:14.680
and dignified, not casual.

00:19:15.599 --> 00:19:18.160
When a brother has a part on the program,

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.640
he should wear a tie and a jacket

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.160
if that is the standard of dress in that land.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:27.559
Of course, some brothers may choose to wear a tie or a jacket

00:19:27.559 --> 00:19:30.480
even when they do not have a part on the program.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:35.000
When visiting Bethel, it would be appropriate for brothers

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.720
to wear a tie and a jacket

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:40.880
and for sisters to wear a skirt or a dress

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:46.420
if that is the standard of dress in that land.

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:49.500
We love you all very much.

00:19:49.539 --> 00:19:52.660
From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.579
this is JW Broadcasting.
