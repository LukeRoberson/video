00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:16.800
When Thomas and I first learned I was pregnant, we were both really shocked, but then we

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.679
grew more and more excited.

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:32.439
And we were so thrilled when we saw our little girl for the first time.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.560
We really didn't care if it was a boy or a girl.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:52.590
We just wanted the baby to be healthy.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.590
Unfortunately, our hopes were completely destroyed when the doctor told us that the baby would

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:12.390
likely be born with severe problems and could even die.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:26.349
My husband and his parents are not Jehovah's Witnesses, but they do feel abortion is wrong.

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:33.450
Still, they thought that we should listen to our doctor's advice.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.049
I couldn't believe this was happening.

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.769
I even questioned why Jehovah would allow it.

00:01:39.769 --> 00:01:45.939
I really felt it was more than I could bear.

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:51.019
Thomas asked me what I wanted to do, and I told him that I could never have an abortion.

00:01:52.019 --> 00:02:04.370
He agreed that normally it would be wrong, but felt that in our situation, God would understand or so overwhelmed.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:15.539
I was being pressured to make a decision I knew was wrong, but that everyone was telling me was best for my child.

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:20.740
I had never felt so alone.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:37.919
I needed Jehovah more than ever, so I poured out my heart to him in prayer, and then I did research.

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:59.740
I showed Thomas the scripture I had found.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:19.680
If men should struggle with each other, and they hurt a pregnant woman,

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:27.500
if a fatality does occur, then you must give life for life.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:34.500
Jehovah views even the unintentional killing of an unborn child as a serious sin.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.500
So how could we intentionally take the life of our child?

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:47.430
I made my decision clear to our doctor.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.610
Thank you. I'll have a look at that later.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.610
And to my in-laws.

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:04.419
There was a chance the diagnosis was incorrect, and I'd love to say that that's what occurred.

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:06.419
But it did not.

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:10.419
My daughter Chloe only loved a few weeks after she was born,

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:14.419
and losing her was the hardest thing I've ever had to endure.

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:21.420
But Jehovah gave me the courage to explain my beliefs to my husband, my in-laws, and the medical staff,

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.420
and they all expressed admiration for my strong faith.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.420
And I've never regretted the decision I made.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:36.420
Even though Chloe only loved those few weeks, I'm so grateful for the time I had with her.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:43.420
I know Jehovah remembers every detail about her, and he'll give her back to me in the resurrection,

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:49.420
in perfect health, because all life is truly precious in his eyes.
