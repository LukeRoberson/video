00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:08.710
All Scripture is inspired of God.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:16.710
Now, let's stop right there and unpack that statement because there's a lot to unpack.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.710
Let's take the last part first, inspired of God.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.710
Now, you know what that means.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:31.710
It means that God put His thoughts into the mind of man and then men wrote them down.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.710
You know what that means.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:40.710
But now, when you tell a householder from house to house that the Bible is inspired by God,

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.710
does the householder necessarily know what you mean?

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.710
Not necessarily.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.710
Why not?

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.710
Because the word inspired is thrown around rather casually today.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.710
This motion picture was inspired by real events.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.710
God is not in the picture.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.709
A poet or a songwriter is inspired by a sunset.

00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:12.709
And so, if the householder doesn't have a strong Bible background,

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:18.709
it's not likely that he understands what you mean when you say that the Bible is inspired by God.

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:27.709
And you'll have to explain that the Bible is God's thoughts about men and not man's thoughts about God.

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:34.709
But now, we're going to spend most of our time on the first part of our text, all Scripture.

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:41.709
And we have to ask, how did Paul and the other Bible writers and the early Christians

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:50.709
and the first century, how did they determine which writings were inspired and which were not?

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:54.709
Now, we'll examine three Bible texts that illustrate the problem.

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:59.709
Now, let's turn to Luke chapter 1 and verse 1.

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:03.150
I'll give you a moment.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:12.150
And our goal in reading this text is to see, is there a problem with determining whether writing is inspired or not?

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.150
Luke chapter 1, verse 1.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:25.150
And Luke writes, seeing that many have undertaken to compile an account of the facts that are given full credence among us,

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.150
what is Luke saying?

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.150
There were many gospels of Jesus Christ in the first century.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.150
And yet only four of them were accepted as inspired.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.150
Now, how was that determined?

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.150
Did the Christians put a bunch of manuscripts on the table?

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.150
And I like this one. This one, not so much.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.150
That wouldn't be a very good way to determine which books were canonical or not.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:03:06.150
Now, as a second illustration, or example, Paul's first letter to the Corinthians was not Paul's first letter to the Corinthians.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:20.210
If you turn to 1 Corinthians 5 and verse 9, you'll see what I mean.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.210
1 Corinthians 5 and verse 9.

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.210
And here Paul writes in his first letter to the Corinthians,

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:36.210
in my letter, I wrote you to stop keeping company with sexually immoral people.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:42.210
So, there was a previous letter before what we now call Paul's first letter to the Corinthians.

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:50.210
I guess if you want to be picky, you would call this one Paul's first inspired letter to the Corinthians.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:55.210
But now that previous letter was never accepted as part of the Bible canon.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:00.210
Why not? Was it a good letter? No doubt it was.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:07.210
Was it accurate in every way? Maybe? Maybe not.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.210
It wasn't inspired.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.210
Now, why do we say it may be not?

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:21.209
Well, insight made a very interesting comment about the writings of Bible writers when they were not writing under inspiration.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:33.209
And speaking of these writings, insight says that they may have reflected to some degree the incomplete understanding that existed in the early years of the Christian congregation.

00:04:33.209 --> 00:04:40.209
So, if someone was just writing for himself, writing a letter to some congregation or some brother, maybe the disciple James,

00:04:40.209 --> 00:04:46.209
he's writing to someone early on before the decision of circumcision is made.

00:04:46.209 --> 00:04:52.209
And he says, well, it's probably best for Gentile Christians to be circumcised.

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:54.209
He might have said something like that.

00:04:54.209 --> 00:04:59.209
But then, of course, when the decision was made under the influence of Holy Spirit,

00:04:59.209 --> 00:05:03.209
James would have written and spoken in harmony with Holy Spirit.

00:05:03.209 --> 00:05:09.209
And, of course, his letter, the letter of James, was written under inspiration.

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:18.209
So, when Bible writers were inspired, their letters and their writings were without error.

00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:23.209
Now, one last example. Turn to Colossians 4 and verse 16.

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:48.379
And Paul writes, and when this letter has been read among you, arrange for it also to be read in the congregation of the Leodiceans,

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:53.379
and for you also to read the one from Leodicea.

00:05:53.379 --> 00:06:01.379
The letter to the Colossians inspired. The letter to the Leodiceans not inspired.

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:06.379
Well, how was the decision made?

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:11.379
Now, the Catholic Church claims that the so-called fathers of the church made the decision

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:19.379
that they are the ones who compiled the Bible canon at the Council of Carthage in 397 CE.

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:24.379
But the decision was made much, much earlier than that.

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:35.829
And we have a clue when we read Peter's words at 2 Peter chapter 3 and verse 16.

00:06:35.829 --> 00:06:38.829
We often read this verse for another reason.

00:06:38.829 --> 00:06:45.829
But let's read 2 Peter 3, 16, and think about the Bible canon.

00:06:45.829 --> 00:06:48.829
And here, Peter is talking about Paul.

00:06:48.829 --> 00:06:54.829
And he says, speaking about these things, as he does in all his letters.

00:06:54.829 --> 00:06:58.829
Now, Peter here is writing in the year 64.

00:06:59.829 --> 00:07:06.829
And that means that at least 13 of Paul's 14 letters had already been circulated.

00:07:06.829 --> 00:07:10.829
So he talks about Paul writing in all his letters.

00:07:10.829 --> 00:07:15.829
However, some things in them are hard to understand.

00:07:15.829 --> 00:07:23.829
And these things, the ignorant and unstable, are twisting as they do also the rest of the scriptures.

00:07:23.829 --> 00:07:34.829
So here, already in the year 64, a decision had been made that Paul's letters were part of the scriptures.

00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:39.829
How? Well, we have an answer to the question.

00:07:39.829 --> 00:07:42.829
We keep asking the question, but we have an answer to it.

00:07:42.829 --> 00:07:52.699
The answer is found in 1 Corinthians chapter 12 and verse 10.

00:07:55.269 --> 00:07:58.269
Have you remember our point in reading this?

00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:09.269
We're looking for the way in which Christians were able to determine in the first century which Bible books and letters were inspired in which were not.

00:08:09.269 --> 00:08:12.269
So Paul is talking about the gifts of the Spirit here.

00:08:12.269 --> 00:08:18.269
And he says that there was given to yet another operations of powerful works.

00:08:18.269 --> 00:08:28.269
To another prophesying, to another discernment of inspired expressions.

00:08:28.269 --> 00:08:44.269
Certain Christians in the first century had a miraculous gift of the Spirit that allowed them to determine to discern which writings were inspired and which were not.

00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:47.269
And that is how the Bible canon came together.

00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:51.269
And when you think of it, it really makes sense, doesn't it?

00:08:51.269 --> 00:08:55.269
Holy Spirit guided the writing of the Bible.

00:08:55.269 --> 00:09:06.269
And Holy Spirit guided the collection of the inspired writings together into what we now know as all scripture.

00:09:06.269 --> 00:09:11.269
All scripture is inspired of God.
