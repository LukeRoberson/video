00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:11.779
The year text for 2020 was about the preaching work, go, make disciples baptizing them.

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:16.660
Now in harmony with that theme, the governing body directed that a number of study articles

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.579
should be prepared for the study edition of the Watchtower on the ministry, and particularly

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.420
about conducting Bible studies.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.160
Then, at the regional convention this summer, why almost the entirety of Saturday was

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.039
dedicated to the disciple-making work?

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:35.439
Why?

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:39.560
We don't just want to report Bible studies.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.240
We want to make disciples.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.039
That's what Jesus told us to do.

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:49.479
Go make disciples baptizing them.

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:55.649
Now when it comes to reporting Bible studies, we're doing very well.

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.810
Worldwide, we're reporting about 10 million Bible studies, and when you think of it, in

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.650
many cases more than one person is sitting in on that study.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:12.730
So it could be that between 12 and 15 million people are studying the Bible with us.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.129
But now, what about the make disciples part of it?

00:01:17.129 --> 00:01:23.170
Well, every year between 200 and 300,000 people are baptized.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:30.170
So you can see that the make disciples part is lagging behind the reporting Bible studies

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.170
part.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.170
Now, this trend has been a concern of the governing bodies for a number of years.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:44.290
And we wondered, why is it that so many people are not taking a stand for the truth?

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.209
You can probably think of a number of reasons yourself.

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:52.450
Some people, for example, are quite happy to learn what the Bible teaches, but they're

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.290
not willing to act on what the Bible teaches.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.409
They're not willing to make drastic changes in their life.

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.049
Some may have studied through a whole book, or maybe two, but they haven't been to a

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.370
single meeting.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:12.090
Maybe one, maybe the memorial once.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:21.330
Well, they make us think of something that Jehovah told the Israelites back in the days

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.330
of Ezekiel.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.689
I'd like you to turn to Ezekiel chapter 33, and we're going to read verse 32.

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:33.689
Now, this was a description of the Israelites in Ezekiel's day, but I think you'll find

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:38.969
that the description fits pretty well a few of our Bible students.

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:46.919
Ezekiel 33, I'll give you a moment, and we're going to read verse 32.

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:54.979
Look, you are to them like a romantic love song, sung with a beautiful voice and skillfully

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:59.280
played on a stringed instrument, but then notice this.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:06.520
They will hear your words, but no one will act on them.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.960
Doesn't that describe some of our Bible students?

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.840
Or maybe the Sunday isn't regular, maybe it isn't consistent, maybe the student often

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.960
cancels or maybe the publisher often cancels.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.080
Well, if a study isn't regular, it's pretty hard for the person to make progress, isn't

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.800
it?

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:34.240
And in many cases, kind-hearted publishers just can't bring themselves to stop the study

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.599
when no progress is being made.

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:41.800
Or they may say, if I stop the study, I won't have a study.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.520
I like having a Bible study.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.699
While we're talking about progressive Bible studies, and that's a challenge, it's not

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:58.400
easy to conduct a progressive Bible study, there are so many factors to consider.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.800
For example, how early do I bring in prayer?

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.080
How do I direct interest to the organization?

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.280
How early should I mention the meetings?

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.439
And what do I do if my Bible student doesn't show up at the meeting?

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:16.399
What about opposition?

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:18.040
That can be tricky.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.000
Bring it up too soon, and you might scare them off.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.519
Wait too long, and it may be too late.

00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:27.519
And what about the ministry?

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:34.240
How do I encourage my Bible student to share what he is learning with others?

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.120
These are a lot of challenges, and don't even mention helping my Bible student to break

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.120
a bad habit like smoking.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.199
One would be great if we could get some help with some of these things.

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:50.279
Here's more food for thought.

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:55.480
How do I make sure that the material is really touching the student's heart?

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.560
I want that student to love Jehovah, to get to know Jehovah.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:06.120
I want him to have a warm personal relationship with Jehovah, so that no one, neither the

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:12.079
boss nor his relatives nor his mate nor his neighbor, will be allowed to come between

00:05:12.079 --> 00:05:15.360
my student and Jehovah God.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.160
Here's another thing.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.319
We're conducting a Bible study, and we want to focus on the scriptures.

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:25.720
Jesus said the seed is the word of God.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:32.360
So now how do I draw my student out as to his feelings about this scripture?

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:38.519
Maybe he understands what the scripture says, but how does he feel about what he is learning?

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:42.000
Wouldn't it be great if some of those questions were

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.959
prepared for us?

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:47.879
Bible students also have challenges in their personal life.

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:52.480
Wouldn't it be great if we could bring someone on our study who has gone through a similar

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.160
situation to the students who understands what the student is going through?

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.560
That would really take the pressure off, wouldn't it?

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.720
And how can you evaluate the progress of the student?

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:10.279
How do I know if the student is steadily working toward becoming an unbaptized publisher

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.839
and then getting baptized?

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:15.680
Here's another thing.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.920
One of the reasons why it takes so long for some to make progress is that there are two

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.439
books and a brochure to go through.

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:24.439
That's a lot of reading.

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:29.319
And when you think of it, a lot of our students have never opened a book since they left school.

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:32.600
So for them, this is a big change.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.720
Some get baptized before they've covered the second book, and that's a pity because

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:43.199
they're losing out on practical information on Christian living that they really need

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:45.000
to have.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.319
And then some of our brothers and sisters are not even using the Jehovah's World brochure

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:53.279
to direct interest to the organization.

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:56.439
The Jehovah's World brochure, what's that?

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:57.439
Exactly.

00:06:57.439 --> 00:07:06.439
Wouldn't it be great if in just one book we could cover all the basic doctrinal matters,

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:12.439
all of the matters about Christian living and direct people's interest in the organization

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:14.560
in just one book?

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.040
That truly would be great.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.839
Well, maybe right now you're saying, all right, I understand we do need some help with

00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:25.240
this, but what are you doing about it?

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.360
I'll tell you.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.879
In April 2018, the service committee of the governing body surveyed the branches to find

00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:38.560
out what teaching methods were really effective in bringing people along to baptism.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:43.920
We have to admit that some of the study material and teaching methods that were used 30 years

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:49.000
ago, they were great for the time, but they don't necessarily meet the needs of people

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000
today.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.600
Well, they got some good answers in, and based on the answers, early in 2019, a team of

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:02.439
brothers, the writers, the designers and consultants, they got together to investigate

00:08:02.439 --> 00:08:07.040
whether we could improve on the tools that we're using.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:12.360
And they came up with a new method for conducting studies.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:17.000
Now, let's stop here and be very clear.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.720
We deeply appreciate all of the study material that we've had over the years.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.720
It's always been great for the times.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:28.959
Now, maybe like me, you cut your teeth on, let God be true.

00:08:28.959 --> 00:08:30.800
This means everlasting life.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.639
The truth shall make you free.

00:08:32.639 --> 00:08:37.440
Those books were just perfect for the period just after World War II.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:42.519
And then we know that the live forever book was a real favorite with many.

00:08:42.519 --> 00:08:48.279
How it wasn't the study forever book, it was the live forever book, but some took on

00:08:48.279 --> 00:08:52.720
not a long time to complete their study in that book.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:59.200
Of course, we've all appreciated the Teach Us book and remain in God's love.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:05.799
All of this material has been very, very good, but times change and people's needs change

00:09:05.799 --> 00:09:07.759
as well.

00:09:07.759 --> 00:09:14.840
We're living in a visual society and people learn less by reading than by observing,

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.960
by watching and by discussion.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.360
So what are we saying?

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.860
Are you ready?

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:31.980
Today, the governing body is happy to announce that a brand new publication for conducting

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:37.940
Bible studies will soon be made available in printed form and in electronic form.

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.299
Would you like to know the title?

00:09:40.299 --> 00:09:41.779
It's a good one.

00:09:41.779 --> 00:09:53.879
Enjoy life forever and interactive Bible course.

00:09:53.879 --> 00:09:57.879
The title is taken from Psalm 2226.

00:09:57.879 --> 00:10:01.799
Jesus seeking Jehovah will praise Him.

00:10:01.799 --> 00:10:04.799
You may you enjoy life forever.

00:10:04.799 --> 00:10:05.799
Isn't that nice?

00:10:05.799 --> 00:10:08.000
Isn't that a nice text?

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.720
Now, how was the course put together?

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:16.559
Well, the branches sent in all of their comments and they were good comments.

00:10:16.559 --> 00:10:25.440
And then the writers got busy and they analyzed the comments that were sent in by the branches.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.600
And on the basis of those comments, three sample lessons were prepared.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:36.639
Now, the lessons looked good on paper, but when they work in the field, to find out,

00:10:36.639 --> 00:10:44.240
those lessons were sent to 97 different countries for field testing, and the results were

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.919
very encouraging.

00:10:45.919 --> 00:10:55.000
So all 60 lessons in the book were sent to the field for testing.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.960
Now, the question may come up, were the testers?

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:04.759
Did you get all the circuit overseers, the missionaries, the special pioneers together, and

00:11:04.759 --> 00:11:06.600
have them test the material?

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:12.559
Well, there were some of those, but we're not all circuit overseers.

00:11:12.559 --> 00:11:15.600
We're not all missionaries or special pioneers.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:20.159
So a wide variety of brothers and sisters were used in this test.

00:11:20.159 --> 00:11:26.000
Some are quite new in the truth, and others had been in the truth for quite some time.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.360
The result is the publication that will soon be made available.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.399
Now, what's different about this course?

00:11:34.399 --> 00:11:38.879
I'm not going to go into much detail because Brother Jackson is going to handle that, but

00:11:38.879 --> 00:11:40.720
here are a couple of points.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.120
First of all, very important.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:49.639
All of the information that's required to answer the 60 questions for baptismal candidates

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:54.000
is covered thoroughly in this book.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:02.279
All of the information needed, that's Bible topics, Christian living topics, directing

00:12:02.279 --> 00:12:08.240
interest to the organization, it's all thoroughly covered in just one book.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.440
You do not repeat.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:16.120
You do not have to study a second book.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.120
What's the format like?

00:12:17.519 --> 00:12:21.559
What is somewhat similar to the midweek workbook?

00:12:21.559 --> 00:12:26.480
And you'll see that it's organized in a way that there can be a free discussion between

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.960
the student and the conductor.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:35.159
In fact, in each lesson, there are just a few introductory paragraphs that the student

00:12:35.159 --> 00:12:40.480
is invited to read ahead of time, but most of the lesson will be handled between the

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.879
conductor and the student.

00:12:42.879 --> 00:12:46.840
It will be a discussion.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.720
The material will focus on the scriptures.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:56.440
A typical sentence might read this scripture, then answer these questions.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:00.039
And the questions are provided.

00:13:00.039 --> 00:13:05.039
The electronic copy of the book has links to some 200 different videos that you can

00:13:05.039 --> 00:13:07.879
read you can have you during the study.

00:13:07.879 --> 00:13:13.840
Remember the problem of having somebody along on the study who has gone through the same

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:17.639
problems as the student has, problem solved.

00:13:17.639 --> 00:13:23.879
You just look up a video interview and play that for the student and note out he will

00:13:23.879 --> 00:13:27.440
glean a great deal of benefit from it.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:32.799
At regular intervals, taxful reference is made to sharing the truth with others.

00:13:32.799 --> 00:13:34.639
A typical question?

00:13:34.639 --> 00:13:39.639
How would you explain what you just learned to a friend?

00:13:39.639 --> 00:13:44.360
At the end of every lesson, the student is given a goal that he can work toward and

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:49.320
that way will help him to evaluate his progress.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.320
And Jehovah's qualities are a showcase throughout the book.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:58.600
We want the student to realize that Jehovah loves him very much and that Jehovah's feelings

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:04.399
are influenced, affected by the decisions that the student makes.

00:14:04.399 --> 00:14:10.639
And that way, he will cultivate a warm personal relationship with Jehovah.

00:14:10.639 --> 00:14:14.960
Well, we humans are creatures of habit, aren't we?

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:20.600
We've used the simple question and answer method for many, many years in conducting Bible

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.600
studies.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.720
And it has met the needs in the past.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:29.080
But in our communication with the branches, it has become obvious that something else

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:30.480
is needed.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:35.000
So ask Jehovah to help you to get used to this new method and use it.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.279
You'll be glad you did.

00:14:37.279 --> 00:14:41.879
We pray that Jehovah will bless our efforts to use this tool.

00:14:41.879 --> 00:14:47.440
And wouldn't it be great if, when you use it, you're not only studying with people, but

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.080
make disciples of them.
