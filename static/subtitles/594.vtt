00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:09.230
The Apostle Paul wrote his letter to the Philippians sometime in the year 60 or 61 CE.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.230
What prompted the letter?

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.230
A gift.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:26.230
A gift that was sent from the congregation to Paul in Rome and carried by a Paphroditus.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:43.229
The letter, as we read it, is characterized by commendation and multiple expressions of appreciation for the generous self-sacrificing spirit of the congregation in Philippa.

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:53.229
The words of today's text are actually part of a prayer that the Apostle Paul said in behalf of the Philippians.

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:56.229
We can read it together in Philippians chapter 1.

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:01.229
So we invite you to turn there, find the verse Philippians chapter 1.

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:08.230
You'll notice in verse 9, Paul says, this is what I continue praying.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:20.230
And then the prayer is actually comprised of three elements, the second in verse 10, that you may make sure of the more important things.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:30.230
So that you may be flawless and not stumbling others up to the day of Christ.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:40.230
Well, it's a beautiful prayer, but a natural question would be, what are the more important things?

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:47.230
It's true, isn't it, that priorities can be determined by circumstances.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:54.230
And Jehovah's people around the earth have a broad range of circumstances.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:07.230
But there are some priorities that are common to Jehovah's people, no matter where we live, whether in Argentina or Zambia or someplace in between.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.229
There are some things that all of us have in common.

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:13.229
Can you think of some?

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:24.229
The sanctification of Jehovah's name, the outworking of his purpose, the unity of the congregation.

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:30.229
Those are important things to all of us.

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:37.229
In this letter, how did the Apostle Paul help the brothers and sisters in Philippi?

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:43.229
And how did he help you and me determine what things are more important?

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:52.229
Well, I thought for a few minutes, we could consider two related qualities mentioned by Paul in this letter.

00:02:52.229 --> 00:03:00.229
And in doing so, we'll discern that they are certainly among the more important things to all of us.

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:04.229
The first is mentioned in Philippians chapter 2.

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:09.229
So let's look at it together. Philippians chapter 2 verse 3.

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:18.699
Paul says, do nothing out of contentiousness or out of egotism.

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:26.699
But with humility, consider others superior to you.

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:34.699
Humility. It's a beautiful quality. Why would it be among the more important things?

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:43.699
Because humility is an essential ingredient of unity and peace.

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:50.139
And the unity of the congregation is important to all of us.

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:54.139
What is it? What is humility?

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:57.139
Well, the footnote gives us some insight.

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:01.139
It says, or lowliness of mind.

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:05.139
So humility is actually a state of mind.

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:11.139
It's how we perceive ourselves in relation to authors.

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:17.139
How did Jesus perceive himself in relation to authors?

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:25.139
Well, he said, I came not to be served, but to serve.

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:30.139
And really, that has to be our mindset, doesn't it?

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:40.139
Whether here at Bethel, we see ourselves as part of a family, working together, shoulder to shoulder,

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:47.139
in the congregation, we see ourselves as part of the congregation, working shoulder to shoulder.

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:52.139
If we serve as an elder, how do we perceive ourselves?

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:58.139
With lowliness of mind, we acknowledge we're a fraction of a scriptural entity.

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:07.420
And we have many opportunities throughout the day to demonstrate lowliness of mind.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.420
For example, we're all descendants of Adam.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.420
We all make mistakes.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.420
But does it take humility, lowliness of mind, to acknowledge a mistake?

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.420
Yes.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:27.420
Does doing so contribute to peace and unity without doubt?

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.420
An apology.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.420
Does it take humility to apologize?

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:44.420
Especially if we think the other party is more responsible or at least equally responsible for a tense situation?

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:45.420
Yes.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:54.420
But for the sake of peace, we may determine that a humble approach is best.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:06:01.420
We demonstrate humility in many other ways throughout the course of a day.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:14.699
And in so doing, we promote peace, we promote unity, and demonstrate that we're making sure of the more important things.

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:21.699
Now, a closely related quality is mentioned by Paul in chapter 4 of his letter.

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:27.699
Let's look together at Philippians chapter 4 verse 11.

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:40.699
He says, not that I am saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be self-sufficient, regardless of my circumstances.

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:45.699
So Paul had learned a secret to be self-sufficient.

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:47.699
What does that mean?

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:52.699
Well, again, the footnote helps us or content.

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:55.699
Paul learned the secret of contentment.

00:06:55.699 --> 00:07:04.699
Now, the context of his words makes clear that he's discussing material provisions specifically.

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:08.699
But there were other reasons that contentment was important.

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:13.699
What were Paul's circumstances when he wrote to the Philippians?

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:20.699
What he says, I have learned to be content, regardless of my circumstances.

00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:25.699
Well, Paul's circumstances were imprisonment.

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:28.699
He was a prisoner in Rome.

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:33.699
And in Acts chapter 28, we read that he lived in a hired house.

00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:37.699
We know that he could share in the ministry to a limited extent.

00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:42.699
He was able to write letters to friends and to congregations.

00:07:42.699 --> 00:07:45.699
That doesn't sound so bad.

00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:51.699
But in his letter to the Philippians, Paul mentions prison bonds.

00:07:51.699 --> 00:07:59.699
In his letter to the Ephesians written in the same time period, he mentions chains.

00:07:59.699 --> 00:08:03.699
Evidently, Paul was chained to a Roman guard.

00:08:03.699 --> 00:08:08.699
His movement was limited, a challenging circumstance.

00:08:08.699 --> 00:08:17.699
He could have become negative. He could have thought to himself, I'm not fulfilling my assignment as an apostle to the nations.

00:08:17.699 --> 00:08:27.699
But instead, he focused on what Jehovah allowed him to do and in the process contributed to the outworking of Jehovah's purpose.

00:08:27.699 --> 00:08:31.699
It's a good lesson for all of us.

00:08:31.699 --> 00:08:38.700
Years ago, when Abby and I were first married, we pioneered in a rural area.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:42.700
It was challenging, and we were there for a number of years.

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:47.700
There was a time when we became anxious and discontent.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.700
There were a number of reasons.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.700
Other pioneers encouraged us to move.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:09:00.700
With the best of motive, they said, move to a city where you can learn some valuable lessons.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:09.700
But an older brother gave us some beautiful advice and encouraged us to learn the secret of contentment.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:14.700
He may have saved our spiritual lives.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:23.700
We learned much in that assignment, and right down to today, we draw on the lessons that Jehovah taught us.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:31.700
So all of us can learn contentment, and we can cultivate humility.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:42.700
If we do, then we can be confident of Jehovah's blessing as we continue to make sure of the more important things.
