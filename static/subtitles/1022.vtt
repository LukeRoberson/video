00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.559
Okay, good, now point six.

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:06.719
What Jehovah does for his friends?

00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:09.080
Cassie, can you tap that link?

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.560
Jehovah has done so much for me.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:21.129
When I was 14, things that happened in the past started to catch up with me emotionally.

00:00:21.129 --> 00:00:28.359
And I felt like everything that had happened in my life was my fault.

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:33.759
Learning from the Bible that God says that He will take my right hand,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.159
that He will fortify me, that He will really help me.

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:47.960
It blew me away.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:55.439
She mentioned a Bible passage where Jehovah takes our hand.

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:56.679
Can you read that?

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:01.640
At Isaiah 41, 10 and 13.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:08.620
Please, do not be afraid, Brian, with you.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.659
Do not be anxious for I am your God.

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.260
I will fortify you.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.780
Yes, I will help you.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.180
I will really hold on to you with my right hand of righteousness.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.180
13, for I Jehovah your God and grasping your right hand.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.859
The one saying to you, do not be afraid, I will help you.

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:33.019
So, Cassie, according to these verses, what is Jehovah promised to do for all of his friends?

00:01:33.019 --> 00:01:35.260
Help us when we're down or scared?

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.859
Yes.

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:39.900
Let's look a little closer, though.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.180
I will fortify, I will help, I will really hold on.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:52.219
Does that sound like a friend who can help or a friend who wants to help?

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:58.299
I never thought of God, Jehovah, like that.

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.980
Do you think that Jehovah would make a good friend?

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:02.980
Sure.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.939
Why?

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:13.819
In verse 10, Jehovah stretches out his hand to you, which one?

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.259
His right.

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:22.219
And then in verse 13, he takes your hand, which one?

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:23.219
My right.

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:24.219
How?

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:29.250
Cassie, come here.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:43.129
So is Jehovah beside you holding your hand or is he in front?

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:44.490
That's it.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.250
His right hand, taking your right hand.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.849
He's facing you.

00:02:51.849 --> 00:03:10.460
To pull you up and out, Cassie, what does Jehovah pull you out of?

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:17.680
Hopelessness, and that is a direct result of friendship with Jehovah.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.319
It grows stronger, the more we talk to him.

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:34.669
Let's look at that in the next section, okay?

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:36.030
Okay, Gene.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:42.719
The last review question is, how can Jesus' death benefit you?

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:47.800
I suppose I should say that it means forgiveness for my sins, but God's not going to forgive

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.120
me.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.280
What makes you feel that way?

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.280
I don't feel.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.280
I know.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.080
I made better choices in my business than I did at home.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.419
Sorry.

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:07.620
Gene, scroll down to where it says, explore, and click under, can Jehovah forgive even

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.620
serious sins?

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.780
Okay, got it.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.300
Can you read the second paragraph, please?

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.659
Sure.

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:22.300
Some people have committed gross sins and wonder whether God can forgive them.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:29.660
Happily, the word of God says, the blood of Jesus his son cleanses us from all sin.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:36.220
Jehovah willingly forgives even serious sins if we have a proper repentance attitude.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.699
The blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin.

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:46.699
Through the ransom, Jehovah forgives our sins, even serious ones, and he draws us to

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:47.699
them.

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:51.259
But Ron, why should anyone get a free pass?

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:53.300
Because it's not free.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.459
Do you see the scripture link to Isaiah chapter 1, verse 18?

00:04:56.459 --> 00:04:57.459
I see it.

00:04:57.459 --> 00:04:59.220
Can you read it, please?

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.139
Come now and let us set matter straight between us, says Jehovah, though your sins are

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.860
like scarlet, they will be made as white as snow.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.579
Though they are as red as crimson cloth, they will become like wool.

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:20.620
So forgiveness of our sins is possible, if we set matter straight.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.860
What do you, Jeane, think that means?

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.689
I need to do what's right.

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:30.689
I'm trying.

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:33.290
Yeah, that's good.

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:34.769
It also involves how we feel.

00:05:34.769 --> 00:05:36.170
We should feel sorry.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:37.170
I am.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.449
No, that's a good sign, Jeane.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:48.379
Lastly, let Jehovah help you with a step that's the hardest for many of us.

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:55.430
He can help you forgive yourself.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:01.300
Jesus died for me.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.819
Ron, I think I'm going to need a little more time to process this.

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:08.300
We all do.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.300
Let's go ahead and conclude with a prayer, and we'll specifically ask Jehovah to strengthen

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.459
your faith in the ransom and his forgiveness.

00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:22.430
Later, when you pray, you can beg him for the same thing.

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:23.430
Thank you.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:24.430
Okay.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.430
Let's say a prayer.
