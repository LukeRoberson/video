00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:09.349
I served as an elder until the end of 2014, and that's when some problems came up and

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.339
I ended up being disqualified.

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:20.339
I had already been serving as an elder for nearly two years, but at the time I felt that

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:25.739
the best thing to do would be to stop and give up my privilege of service so I could care

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:30.300
for myself emotionally.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.939
Before I lost my privileges, my qualifications were reviewed by the elders on three separate

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:43.890
occasions, and that ended up dampening my desire to want to serve again in the future.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.929
I began thinking, published to receive the same reward as an elder, so why should I put

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:52.450
myself through that all over again?

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:59.579
When you resign or are disqualified from serving as an elder, you're not immune to feeling

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:09.060
like you're a failure, feeling sad, and especially feeling that you've let your hover down.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.659
And it's a fight to remain active.

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.819
One of the biggest things that helped me during that phase was my wife's support.

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:21.980
She believed in me and helped motivate me.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:27.140
My wife was already a pioneer, and she encouraged me to start pioneering too.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.180
So within just a few months, I had already started serving as a pioneer.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:39.099
It was in the ministry that I began to cultivate and desire to serve once again as an elder.

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:47.209
Getting involved in activities with the congregation, helping out with the cleaning.

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:55.200
Being with my wife in the preaching work, conducting Bible studies.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:02.079
I had a lot of help from the brothers who cried with me when I needed to cry.

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:05.760
And who laughed with me when it was possible to laugh.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.400
On mature elder helped me to see that I needed to leave the matter in Jehovah's hands.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.280
That time period when I stopped serving as an elder, I can say that that may have been

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.120
when I prayed the most in all my life.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.080
I still wasn't an elder, but I felt at peace.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.000
I remembered first John 320 that Jehovah is greater than our hearts and that he knew what

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.280
I was going through.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.639
And just because I wasn't serving any longer as an elder, that didn't make Jehovah love

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:37.360
me any less.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.520
That helped me a lot.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.719
The most difficult thing to overcome was really the resentment that I felt towards some

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:48.479
brothers who had participated in the whole process.

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:53.319
The scripture at Psalm 119, 165, helped me to see that when you're going through a difficult

00:02:53.319 --> 00:03:00.139
situation, that's the time that you need to show that you love Jehovah.

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:04.539
I could see that during that time of my life, that's when I had the show that I really

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:05.740
love Jehovah.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:12.379
I would pray to Jehovah each and every day, and I would mention those brothers by name.

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:17.259
That helped me to start softening my heart to lesson and eventually to eliminate this

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:20.819
resentment.

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:29.310
Trusting in Jehovah was so worth it.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:36.310
And I felt like it was a great act of love on his part, to allow me once again to serve

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.310
as an elder.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.830
And if as if he told me, Marcelo, I trusted you are going to do a good job as an elder.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.110
We just have to trust in Jehovah.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.909
When I began to show more trust, that's when things started happening in a way that I

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:52.189
couldn't have imagined.

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:55.789
In less than two years, I had already began serving as an elder again.

00:03:55.789 --> 00:04:05.509
And in 2016, we received an invitation to serve at Bethel.

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:12.379
My wife and I have now been serving here at Bethel for a little more than ten years.

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:18.579
When you accept the discipline, then you stop thinking about privileges and start thinking

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.420
more about the brothers and about being more involved in the ministry.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:29.740
I still had the most important privilege, that of being one of Jehovah's Witnesses.
