00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:09.710
A building constructed with steel reinforced concrete can withstand powerful earthquakes.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:17.710
A tree with strong, deep roots can remain standing in the face of many powerful storms.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:26.710
An athlete made powerful by rigorous training can successfully complete a de-cathlon, a

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.710
ten-event athletic contest.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:39.710
Well, just as a building, a tree, and an athlete can be powerful, we as Jehovah's people

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.710
can be powerful by means of our faith.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:51.710
And we will discuss during this talk how faith, a product of Holy Spirit, the most powerful force in the universe,

00:00:51.710 --> 00:01:02.710
can reinforce fortify us for any, and I mean any test trial or temptation that comes our way.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:12.709
Now, even though we may not feel powerful physically or emotionally, our faith can make us powerful spiritually.

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:20.709
And spiritual power is much more valuable than physical or emotional power.

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:24.709
With spiritual power, we can be like Abraham.

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:32.709
Please go to Romans chapter 4, and notice what was said about Abraham beginning in verse number 18.

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:44.709
Although beyond hope, yet based on hope, he had faith that he would become the father of many nations according to what had been said,

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:47.709
so your offspring will be.

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:52.709
And although he did not grow weak in faith, he considered his own body.

00:01:52.709 --> 00:02:00.709
Now as good as dead since he was about a hundred years old, as well as the deadness of the womb of Sarah.

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:06.709
But because of the promise of God, he did not waver in a lack of faith.

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:19.710
But he noticed, became powerful by his faith, giving God glory and being fully convinced that what he Jehovah had promised,

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.710
he Jehovah was also able to do.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:33.710
Even though almost 100 years old and likely Abraham would have been frail physically and emotionally weak at times,

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.710
his faith made him powerful.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:50.710
In fact, his faith made him so powerful that he believed this extraordinary promise with all his heart that his almost 90-year-old wife Sarah would give birth to a son.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.710
And they would definitely come true.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:03:01.710
And even though that promise was unbelievable from a human standpoint, he had no doubt whatsoever.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:13.710
Well likewise, if our faith makes us powerful, we will fully believe all of Jehovah's promises no matter how extraordinary they may seem.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.710
We will do so without doubting whatsoever.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.710
But now think about this comparison to Abraham.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:29.710
An older frail, chronically ill servant of Jehovah, may seem weak.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.710
But outward appearance can be very deceptive.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:41.710
If that one has been empowered by faith, then he is truly strong just like Abraham.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:51.710
And this wonderful convention was designed to fortify our faith so that it will empower us to be so strong,

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:57.710
that we will be able to endure whatever test, trial, temptation comes against us.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:03.710
And there will actually be no breaking point to our integrity.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:13.710
But now let's talk about how each day of our convention and our outstanding drama have strengthened our faith.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.710
First, let's talk about Friday.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:20.709
The day's theme was a quote from Luke 17.5,

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.709
Give us more faith.

00:04:23.709 --> 00:04:30.709
Now these were the humble words of Jesus Apostles who recognized their need for more faith.

00:04:30.709 --> 00:04:33.709
And they were humbly pleading for such.

00:04:33.709 --> 00:04:35.709
Well, we feel the same way, don't we?

00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:38.709
We know we need more faith.

00:04:38.709 --> 00:04:41.709
And we humbly ask Jehovah for it.

00:04:41.709 --> 00:04:48.709
But now the question is, will Jehovah answer our pleas for more faith?

00:04:48.709 --> 00:04:49.709
Yes, he will.

00:04:49.709 --> 00:04:57.709
And Friday reveal some of the ways Jehovah answers our humble plea for more faith.

00:04:57.709 --> 00:05:05.709
As illuminated on Friday, Jehovah gives us faith primarily by means of two books,

00:05:05.709 --> 00:05:09.709
The Bible and the Book of Creation.

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:16.709
The first symposium showed how the Bible builds faith in God's existence.

00:05:16.709 --> 00:05:18.709
It builds faith in itself.

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:20.709
That is the word of God.

00:05:20.709 --> 00:05:23.709
It builds faith in God's moral standards.

00:05:23.709 --> 00:05:27.709
And it gives a builds faith in God's love for us.

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:32.709
But now we ask that first part, how does the Bible build faith in God's existence?

00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:36.709
Well, for one thing, within his pages,

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:42.709
it gives us common sense reasoning scriptures, such as Hebrews 3.4.

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:44.709
And you know what that says?

00:05:44.709 --> 00:05:49.709
It says, of course, every house is constructed by someone,

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:53.709
but the one who constructed all things is God.

00:05:53.709 --> 00:06:02.709
Now you could never convince any sane person that a beautiful house designed and built itself.

00:06:02.709 --> 00:06:04.709
Even more so.

00:06:04.709 --> 00:06:12.709
It should not be possible to convince any rational person that all the beautiful creations around us

00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:20.709
just designed and built themselves, or that they're the product of blind chance.

00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:26.709
Where there is design, there is always a designer.

00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:28.709
Now let's illustrate this.

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:35.709
How many times would you have to throw black paint from a can into a white ceiling

00:06:35.709 --> 00:06:41.709
until you produced a perfect map of New York City?

00:06:41.709 --> 00:06:46.709
Until the paint particle scattered accurately, identifying all of the streets,

00:06:46.709 --> 00:06:53.709
the highways, the tunnels, the bridges, the overpasses, and the landmarks, and correctly named each one?

00:06:53.709 --> 00:06:56.709
Well, you could do that for billions of times.

00:06:56.709 --> 00:07:00.709
And never would you produce a perfect map of New York City?

00:07:00.709 --> 00:07:02.709
Not to add a little humor.

00:07:02.709 --> 00:07:07.709
Let's say you tried doing this a hundred billion years, and you get excited.

00:07:07.709 --> 00:07:09.709
You finally got a city map.

00:07:09.709 --> 00:07:13.709
But oh no, it's not New York City.

00:07:13.709 --> 00:07:15.709
It's Warwick, New York.

00:07:15.709 --> 00:07:19.709
Now you got to start all over going for that map of New York City.

00:07:19.709 --> 00:07:22.709
I had to give you a little, little humor.

00:07:22.709 --> 00:07:24.709
But say this.

00:07:24.709 --> 00:07:34.709
One living human cell is much more complex, intricately designed than a map of New York City.

00:07:34.709 --> 00:07:40.709
And one human body is made up of about a hundred trillion of such amazing cells,

00:07:40.709 --> 00:07:44.709
all working together harmoniously.

00:07:44.709 --> 00:07:49.709
Well, in the second part, how does a Bible build faith in itself?

00:07:49.709 --> 00:07:51.709
That it is the Word of God.

00:07:51.709 --> 00:07:58.709
Well, for one thing, everything the Bible recommends works, brings superior results,

00:07:58.709 --> 00:08:03.709
how to raise children, how to have a happy marriage, and so forth.

00:08:03.709 --> 00:08:04.709
Think about it.

00:08:04.709 --> 00:08:10.709
Humans simply aren't smart enough to recommend only what works,

00:08:10.709 --> 00:08:15.709
and their advice is constantly being revised and updated, isn't it?

00:08:15.709 --> 00:08:21.709
Though written hundreds, thousands of years ago, the Bible has never needed to be revised,

00:08:21.709 --> 00:08:24.709
yet everything it recommends works.

00:08:24.709 --> 00:08:29.709
It has to be from a higher source than humans.

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:34.710
Well, in the third part, how does a Bible build faith in God's moral standards?

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:36.710
Well, it tells us what they are.

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:41.710
It encourages us to obey them, and when we do,

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:45.710
it protects us physically, emotionally, spiritually.

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:50.710
We get happiness, we get a good conscience, we experience the benefits.

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:56.710
Thus, we don't have to learn the painful process of trial and error.

00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:01.710
There's a saying that experience is the best teacher.

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:03.710
Completely wrong.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:07.710
Experience is a school of hard knocks.

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:09.710
Jehovah is the best teacher.

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:17.710
Jehovah is making the inexperienced one wise, according to Psalm 19.7.

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:23.710
Well, the fourth part, how does a Bible build faith in God's love for us?

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:30.710
The most powerful way, it explains how Jehovah gave his firstborn son to die for us

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:33.710
so that we could have everlasting life.

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:34.710
Now, think about it.

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:38.710
What do most people give away if they give something away?

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:42.710
Something they don't need, or at least something they can do without.

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:48.710
But Jehovah gave at great cost, great pain to himself.

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:54.710
Evolution teaches that our ancestors were apes.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:10:03.710
How could we feel happy and feel loved thinking that an ape was our father?

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:12.279
But our real father, Jehovah, is the personification of love.

00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:19.279
But now, Friday afternoon, we had our second symposium, which opened the book of creation.

00:10:19.279 --> 00:10:25.279
And peering into this book can empower our faith.

00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:30.279
First, let's talk about the first talk that dealt with the stars.

00:10:30.279 --> 00:10:37.279
Isaiah 40, verse 26, tells us that Jehovah created all of them.

00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:41.279
And he calls all of them by name.

00:10:41.279 --> 00:10:44.279
Now, let's ponder this for a moment.

00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:53.279
How long would it take you to name just the stars in the Milky Way galaxy if you named one every second?

00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:57.279
A Joseph Paul Rachel Sarah.

00:10:57.279 --> 00:11:06.279
Well, scientists estimate there are perhaps 400 billion stars just in the Milky Way galaxy.

00:11:06.279 --> 00:11:10.279
So if you named one a second, it would take you 400 billion seconds.

00:11:10.279 --> 00:11:15.279
Now, how long is that? 12,684 years.

00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:21.279
More than twice the time that has passed since the creation of Adam.

00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:24.279
And then you could go to the next galaxy.

00:11:24.279 --> 00:11:31.279
And scientists estimate there may be two trillion galaxies in the universe.

00:11:31.279 --> 00:11:39.279
That's five times the number of galaxies as there are individual stars in the Milky Way.

00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:43.279
Now, you ponder that. It'll really give you a headache.

00:11:43.279 --> 00:11:48.279
Yet Jehovah created sustains and calls every one of them by name.

00:11:48.279 --> 00:11:52.279
And the talk made to point, if Jehovah can do that,

00:11:52.279 --> 00:12:00.279
he will have no problem remembering and recreating all those sleeping in the memorial tombs.

00:12:00.279 --> 00:12:06.279
The second talk examined the page in the book of creation about the oceans.

00:12:06.279 --> 00:12:09.279
How powerful they are.

00:12:09.279 --> 00:12:13.279
But the one who made them is vastly more powerful.

00:12:13.279 --> 00:12:21.279
And our powerful God definitely can protect us now and right through the Great Tribulation.

00:12:22.279 --> 00:12:26.279
The third talk examined the page in creation about the forest.

00:12:26.279 --> 00:12:34.279
And it was discussed how forest have the amazing ability to repair and renew themselves.

00:12:34.279 --> 00:12:39.279
And the poem was made, the one who had the wisdom to create such forest,

00:12:39.279 --> 00:12:47.279
surely knows how to undo all the damage that man has done to the planet Earth.

00:12:48.279 --> 00:12:52.279
The fourth talk focused on wind and water.

00:12:52.279 --> 00:12:57.279
And it talked about how Jehovah in the past has used wind and water,

00:12:57.279 --> 00:13:05.279
and especially water in the form of hail, to defeat his enemies and deliver his people.

00:13:05.279 --> 00:13:09.279
Well, he will use them again at Armageddon.

00:13:09.279 --> 00:13:15.279
The fifth talk took a glimpse into the fascinating world of sea creatures.

00:13:15.279 --> 00:13:21.279
And we looked at the largest animal alive on Earth today, the Blue Whale.

00:13:21.279 --> 00:13:26.279
And what an appetite that Blue Whale has.

00:13:26.279 --> 00:13:32.279
It can eat, according to the video, tons of food every day.

00:13:32.279 --> 00:13:34.279
Yet Jehovah feeds it.

00:13:34.279 --> 00:13:39.279
Now, if he can do that, can he not feed and care for us?

00:13:39.279 --> 00:13:48.279
If we continue to seek first the kingdom, well, our faith was strengthened that he can and he will.

00:13:48.279 --> 00:13:53.279
The last talk examined our amazing bodies.

00:13:53.279 --> 00:14:01.279
As discussed, it's miraculous how our bodies heal and repair themselves when damaged.

00:14:01.279 --> 00:14:02.279
Now, think of this.

00:14:02.279 --> 00:14:08.279
If you damage scraper dent your car, does it heal itself? Hardly.

00:14:08.279 --> 00:14:15.279
What if every time we brew scraped, damaged our body, it just stayed that way?

00:14:15.279 --> 00:14:20.279
In a short time, we'd get to looking pretty rough.

00:14:20.279 --> 00:14:28.279
But the God who made our bodies this miraculous way certainly can heal all infirmities,

00:14:28.279 --> 00:14:33.279
reverse aging, and prevent sickness in his new world.

00:14:33.279 --> 00:14:36.279
And he has promised to do that.

00:14:36.279 --> 00:14:42.279
Well, the third symposium went back to our main book that builds faith, the Bible.

00:14:42.279 --> 00:14:47.279
And we discussed ones who acquired strong faith.

00:14:47.279 --> 00:14:49.279
And we discussed how they did it.

00:14:49.279 --> 00:14:56.279
And even though their contemporaries were faithless, they developed this faith.

00:14:56.279 --> 00:15:05.279
Well, our faith was empowered as we discussed Abel, Enoch, Noah, Moses, Jesus' disciples,

00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:14.279
and we became more determined than ever to imitate these faithful ones and not their faithless contemporaries.

00:15:14.279 --> 00:15:25.279
And we know we can be successful because we have the same father, helper, supplier of Holy Spirit as they had.

00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:33.279
Yes, our three symposiums on Friday clearly showed us that Jehovah answers our pleas for more faith

00:15:33.279 --> 00:15:38.279
by means of two books, the Bible and the Book of Creation.

00:15:38.279 --> 00:15:47.279
Well, regarding our drama, we asked, how did Jehovah answer Daniel's pleas for more faith?

00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:51.279
Well, one way, he gave Daniel his written word.

00:15:52.279 --> 00:16:00.279
In the drama, if you recall, Daniel's father gave him a scroll that he regularly referred to.

00:16:00.279 --> 00:16:02.279
Did you recognize that scroll?

00:16:02.279 --> 00:16:08.279
The scroll depicted in the drama is known today as Psalm 27.

00:16:08.279 --> 00:16:16.279
When enemies tried to discredit Daniel, we saw him reflect on Psalm 27, 11 and 12, which says in part,

00:16:16.279 --> 00:16:27.279
do not hand me over to my adversaries, for false witnesses have risen up against me, and they threaten me with violence.

00:16:27.279 --> 00:16:37.279
When he was threatened with execution, we saw him reflect on Psalm 27, 7 through 9, which says in part,

00:16:37.279 --> 00:16:45.279
you are my helper, do not forsake me or leave me my God of salvation.

00:16:45.279 --> 00:16:51.279
How those verses would have bolstered Daniel's faith?

00:16:51.279 --> 00:17:04.279
Of course, we cannot say for sure that Daniel reflected on those specific verses, but the Bible does reveal that Daniel's faith indeed was strengthened by the Scriptures.

00:17:05.279 --> 00:17:10.279
And we know that Daniel was a keen student of Bible prophecy.

00:17:10.279 --> 00:17:25.279
He even said of himself at Daniel 9, verse 2, I, Daniel, discerned by the books, that is the sacred books, the number of years, and then he talks about the desolation restoration of Jerusalem, namely 70 years.

00:17:25.279 --> 00:17:31.849
But now we ask, will Jehovah answer our pleas for more faith?

00:17:32.849 --> 00:17:34.849
Most definitely he will.

00:17:34.849 --> 00:17:42.849
And one outstanding way he has done this is by providing us with Bible prophecy.

00:17:42.849 --> 00:17:49.849
Prophecies in the book of Daniel alone have helped millions to build rock-solid faith.

00:17:49.849 --> 00:17:58.849
For example, the fulfilled prophecies regarding the King of the North and the King of the South have been very faith strengthening.

00:17:58.849 --> 00:18:07.849
In fact, let's review the video on this topic that appeared in Brother Kenneth Cook's May broadcast.

00:18:07.849 --> 00:18:09.849
Enjoy this powerful video.

00:18:09.849 --> 00:18:21.400
Daniel received a prophecy about the coming of two rivals, the King of the North and the King of the South.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:30.380
How has it been fulfilled?

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:35.380
In the late 1800s, the German Empire became the King of the North.

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:41.380
That government brought its power and heart against the King of the South with a large army.

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:51.140
In fact, its navy was the second largest on earth, who became the King of the South.

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:55.140
The alliance between Britain and the United States.

00:18:55.140 --> 00:19:01.140
He fought during World War I with an exceedingly large and mighty army.

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:05.140
He swept away and humbled the King of the North.

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:10.990
But that was not the end of the King of the North.

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:16.990
He turned his attention to and then hurled denunciations against the Holy Covenant.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:23.990
He removed the constant feature by limiting the freedom of God's people to preach,

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:31.619
imprisoning many and even killing hundreds of God's anointed ones and their fellow workers.

00:19:31.619 --> 00:19:40.180
After Germany was defeated in World War II, the Soviet Union became the King of the North.

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:47.180
It worked with the King of the South to put in place the disgusting thing that causes desolation.

00:19:47.180 --> 00:20:00.009
The United Nations.

00:20:00.009 --> 00:20:07.009
Beginning in the early 1900s, the Soviet government tried to eliminate religion in the lands under its control,

00:20:07.009 --> 00:20:13.859
fulfilling the words that he would show no regard for the God of his fathers.

00:20:13.859 --> 00:20:23.059
He gave glory not to the God of heaven, but to the God of fortresses.

00:20:23.059 --> 00:20:32.980
As prophesied, he used this military mind against the King of the South by engaging with him in a pushing.

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:41.980
Anglo-America competed with the Soviet Union for world domination, fighting in and supporting wars and political struggles around the globe.

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:53.650
After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, it was unclear who would fill the role of the King of the North.

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:58.650
For a time, God's people there had been able to preach and worship peacefully.

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:05.650
But in recent years, Russia and its allies have pushed back at the King of the South.

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:11.650
Both kings have accused each other of destructive cyber and economic attacks.

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:16.650
But the King of the North has not limited his attacks to the King of the South.

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:24.650
As foretold, he also entered into the land of the decoration, our realm of spiritual activity.

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:32.539
Today, Russian authorities continue to attack true worship.

00:21:32.539 --> 00:21:35.539
We expect such persecution.

00:21:35.539 --> 00:21:57.220
But we also expect it to end.

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:04.529
Our King, Jesus Christ, is more powerful than any human government.

00:22:04.529 --> 00:22:11.529
Soon, he will destroy not only the kings of the North, South, but all of his enemies.

00:22:11.529 --> 00:22:15.529
And he will deliver God's loyal people.

00:22:15.529 --> 00:22:47.359
What a powerful video.

00:22:47.359 --> 00:22:54.359
Has the unerring accuracy of those prophecies strengthened your faith?

00:22:54.359 --> 00:22:56.359
We're confident that it has.

00:22:56.359 --> 00:23:04.359
And we're absolutely convinced that the rest of that prophecy, including our deliverance, will be fulfilled.

00:23:04.359 --> 00:23:12.359
Christ soon will defend God's people and bring an end to this entire wicked system.

00:23:13.359 --> 00:23:19.359
May all of us continue to study these and other prophecies.

00:23:19.359 --> 00:23:30.359
If we do, our faith and our wise, our all-powerful, our loving Father will definitely be strengthened.

00:23:30.359 --> 00:23:37.359
But now, let's move to Saturday's program, which had the theme taken from Jude 3,

00:23:37.359 --> 00:23:41.359
put up a hard fight for the faith.

00:23:41.359 --> 00:23:50.359
The symposium, successful fighters for the faith, show that many who do not have a spouse

00:23:50.359 --> 00:23:57.359
and many whose spouse is not yet serving Jehovah are winning their fight for the faith.

00:23:57.359 --> 00:24:03.359
And we warmly commend you dear beloved ones.

00:24:04.359 --> 00:24:11.359
The baptism discourse encouraged new disciples to continue strengthening their faith.

00:24:11.359 --> 00:24:16.359
And we warmly welcome all newly baptized ones.

00:24:16.359 --> 00:24:18.359
Jehovah loves you very much.

00:24:18.359 --> 00:24:21.359
The governing body loves you very much.

00:24:21.359 --> 00:24:24.359
Your brothers and sisters love you very much.

00:24:24.359 --> 00:24:32.359
And we're so happy to have you join us in our united family of intense fighters,

00:24:32.359 --> 00:24:35.359
for the faith.

00:24:35.359 --> 00:24:44.359
The two afternoon symposiums helped us to analyze how we can show our faith by giving of our time,

00:24:44.359 --> 00:24:51.359
energy, material things to advance the kingdom work and to help others.

00:24:51.359 --> 00:24:55.359
And we discuss some specific things that we may be able to do.

00:24:55.359 --> 00:25:00.359
For example, learn a new language.

00:25:00.359 --> 00:25:03.359
Move and serve with a need is greater.

00:25:03.359 --> 00:25:07.359
Apply for the school for kingdom evangelizers.

00:25:07.359 --> 00:25:10.359
Assist with a building project.

00:25:10.359 --> 00:25:14.359
Set something aside for Jehovah's work.

00:25:14.359 --> 00:25:19.670
The talk put up a hard fight for the faith.

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:23.670
Reminded us that as is true in all fights.

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:27.670
In our fight, we have enemies.

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:34.670
For one thing, we must reject apostate lies in the false stories of other opposers

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:39.670
which are designed to soar out and weaken faith.

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:45.670
Satan is very skilled at using innuendo half-truths and lies.

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:52.670
So it's not surprising that the news media, which is often manipulated by apostates,

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:59.670
clergymen and other opposers, likewise often employs innuendo,

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:04.670
half-truths and lies against Jehovah's organization.

00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:06.670
Think about this.

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:09.670
Faith is a prog of Holy Spirit.

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:14.670
It's a provision from Jehovah to strengthen us.

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:21.670
Whereas doubt is a tool of the devil designed to weaken us.

00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:25.670
Do you recall how Satan approached Eve?

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:31.670
Is it really so that God said you must not eat from every tree of the garden?

00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:33.670
Is that really so?

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:36.670
Why did he present it that way?

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:41.670
To plant doubt and shipwreck her faith, and he succeeded.

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:46.670
Well, likewise, if we're not careful, doubt can shipwreck our faith.

00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:52.670
But strong faith keeps doubt out of our hearts and minds.

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:56.670
But now, talking just a little bit more about apostates,

00:26:56.670 --> 00:27:00.670
what if an apostate knocked at your front door and said,

00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:02.670
I'd like to come into your home.

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:09.670
I'd like to sit down with you and I'd like to teach you some apostate ideas.

00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:12.670
Well, you would immediately get rid of him, wouldn't you?

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:15.670
You would send him down the highway.

00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:20.670
But now think of this, what if that same apostate tries to come into your home

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:24.670
by means of the television or computer?

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:30.670
Well, hopefully, we reject him just as decisively.

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:37.670
Second John 10 says, if anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching,

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:41.670
never receive him into your home.

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:47.670
That would mean not through the front door, not through the television or computer.

00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:50.670
Sadly, though, some have reasoned foolishly.

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:54.670
If I listen to this apostate on television or the computer,

00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:59.670
or perhaps read his book, I'll recognize how wrong he is.

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:01.670
It'll build up my faith.

00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:05.670
And if I ever encounter this teaching in the ministry,

00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:08.670
I'll better be able to refute it.

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:12.670
Well, that is foolish thinking indeed.

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:19.670
That would be like reasoning if I ate stinky rotten food from a garbage can.

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:24.670
It'll really help me in the future to recognize bad food.

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:28.670
Not very good reasoning, is it?

00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:32.670
Rather than feed our minds, poison apostate ideas,

00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:39.670
we read God's word daily and strengthen and safeguard our faith.

00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:44.670
But now we ask, how did Daniel put up a hard fight for the faith?

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:51.670
Well, for one thing, he resisted pressure to compromise.

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:58.670
But can you imagine the pressure he must have faced when offered the King's delicacies and wine?

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:01.670
How was he able to refuse?

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:06.670
Well, for the answer, let's go to Daniel chapter 1, please.

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:10.670
And let's read number, verse number 8.

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:19.670
1-8, but Daniel resolved in his heart that he would not defile himself

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:23.670
with the King's delicacies or with the wine he drank.

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:30.670
So he asked the principal court official for permission not to defile himself in this way.

00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:39.670
So notice, in advance, Daniel resolved in his heart the course he was going to take.

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:50.529
And he did so because he was fully convinced that whatever Jehovah had commanded was for his good.

00:29:50.529 --> 00:29:55.529
Well, like Daniel, we must put up a hard fight for the faith.

00:29:55.529 --> 00:29:58.529
Are you facing pressure right now?

00:29:58.529 --> 00:30:05.529
At school, at work, or even at home, to compromise.

00:30:05.529 --> 00:30:11.529
If so, please don't give up and don't give in.

00:30:11.529 --> 00:30:16.529
Reflect on Daniel's example and fight for your faith.

00:30:16.529 --> 00:30:23.529
Be resolved to obey Jehovah because doing so is always the right thing.

00:30:23.529 --> 00:30:28.529
And if you do, you will have no regrets.

00:30:28.529 --> 00:30:33.529
Pressure was also put on Daniel by means of threats.

00:30:33.529 --> 00:30:41.529
But can you imagine how Daniel felt when he became aware that his next prayer could lead to his execution?

00:30:41.529 --> 00:30:44.529
What helped him to stay loyal?

00:30:44.529 --> 00:30:49.529
Let's go to Daniel chapter 6 and get some help with that question.

00:30:49.529 --> 00:30:56.529
Daniel chapter 6 and please, let's read together verse number 10.

00:30:56.529 --> 00:31:04.529
But as soon as Daniel knew that the decree had been signed, he went to his house,

00:31:04.529 --> 00:31:08.529
which had the windows of his roof chamber open toward Jerusalem,

00:31:08.529 --> 00:31:16.529
and three times a day he got down on his knees and prayed and offered praise before his God.

00:31:16.529 --> 00:31:25.529
Now notice, as he had regularly done prior to this, so Daniel knew what was right,

00:31:25.529 --> 00:31:28.529
and he didn't hesitate to do it.

00:31:28.529 --> 00:31:30.529
And he was consistent in his worship.

00:31:30.529 --> 00:31:38.529
Daniel chapter 6 verse 16 tells us that Daniel was continually serving his God.

00:31:38.529 --> 00:31:48.529
And what Char explains, the original Bible word translated continually serving basically means to move in a circle,

00:31:48.529 --> 00:31:51.529
which suggests continuity.

00:31:51.529 --> 00:31:55.529
And how well that describes Daniel's unbroken worship.

00:31:55.529 --> 00:32:00.529
See, there's no end to a circle. It's unbroken. Is it not?

00:32:00.529 --> 00:32:06.529
Please watch the following dramatization that depicts a brother,

00:32:06.529 --> 00:32:12.529
who faces a threat of being arrested. But by reflecting on Daniel's example,

00:32:12.529 --> 00:32:21.529
he is helped to continue serving Jehovah with constancy in the face of this intimidating circumstance.

00:32:21.529 --> 00:32:34.079
It's still chaos in many parts of the city, with armed soldiers detaining and arresting those not pledging support of the new government.

00:32:34.079 --> 00:32:36.079
Are we still going to the meeting tonight?

00:32:36.079 --> 00:32:41.740
I wanted to do what was best for my wife and daughter.

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:50.089
But a few of the elders have already been arrested.

00:32:50.089 --> 00:32:53.089
What if I was arrested?

00:32:53.089 --> 00:33:31.220
What happened to my family?

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:33.220
You're not going on a prayer, are you?

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:42.220
I pray at my window three times a day, every day, if I even appear to compromise.

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:47.549
What would they think?

00:33:47.549 --> 00:33:54.549
I know Jehovah. And if I trust him, he'll reward me.

00:33:54.549 --> 00:34:01.589
I don't know how, but he will.

00:34:01.589 --> 00:34:11.590
Pray that I keep my faith, that we all keep our faith, no matter how this ends.

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:16.820
The scriptures are clear.

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:20.820
We must continue to meet together, even in small groups, if necessary.

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:26.820
Let's just pray that whatever happens, we have the strength to endure it.

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:32.000
Dear Jehovah, please.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:46.170
Eventually, I was arrested.

00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:51.170
We miss you so much, but we're very proud of you.

00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:57.170
We know whatever the outcome of your trial, you'll maintain your faith, and so will we.

00:34:57.170 --> 00:35:02.699
Are you scared?

00:35:02.699 --> 00:35:13.329
I was very scared, but Jehovah helps us when we're scared.

00:35:13.329 --> 00:35:22.179
I knew I would be okay, and that Jehovah would take care of my family.

00:35:22.179 --> 00:35:28.179
As was true of the brother in our video, we will be persecuted.

00:35:28.179 --> 00:35:34.179
2 Timothy 312 says, all those desiring to live with Godly devotion

00:35:34.179 --> 00:35:40.179
and association with Christ Jesus will also be persecuted.

00:35:40.179 --> 00:35:47.179
It didn't say, maybe, good chance, probably, will be persecuted, guaranteed.

00:35:47.179 --> 00:35:55.179
But like our brother in the video, when persecuted, let's reflect on Daniel's example.

00:35:55.179 --> 00:35:58.179
And let's fight for our faith.

00:35:58.179 --> 00:36:06.179
And let's pray, confident, that our God is always mightier than our enemies.

00:36:06.179 --> 00:36:10.179
Let's be like young David when he went out to meet Goliath.

00:36:10.179 --> 00:36:12.179
Now David saw the big picture, didn't he?

00:36:12.179 --> 00:36:20.179
Sure, he saw how big Goliath was, but in the big picture, he saw how puny Goliath was,

00:36:20.179 --> 00:36:25.179
compared to his Almighty God, Jehovah.

00:36:25.179 --> 00:36:33.179
In a unique way, Daniel also experienced how mighty Jehovah is when he was thrown into the lion's pit.

00:36:33.179 --> 00:36:38.179
Jehovah sent an angel to shut the mouths of those lions.

00:36:38.179 --> 00:36:43.179
Now think about it, those lions obviously were very hungry because a little bit later,

00:36:43.179 --> 00:36:48.179
when people were thrown in there, they were consumed before they hit the bottom of the pit.

00:36:48.179 --> 00:36:50.179
So they were very hungry.

00:36:50.179 --> 00:36:53.179
And Daniel would have looked like a tasty morsel.

00:36:53.179 --> 00:37:02.179
But no matter how hard they tried, those lions couldn't get their mouths open to harm Daniel.

00:37:03.179 --> 00:37:11.179
Daniel also said a good example in remaining hopeful despite old age and infirmities.

00:37:11.179 --> 00:37:16.179
But can you imagine how Daniel felt when he was almost a hundred years old

00:37:16.179 --> 00:37:22.179
and many Jews left for their beloved homeland, Judah, and he was unable to go with him?

00:37:22.179 --> 00:37:26.179
But what helped him to keep his hope alive?

00:37:26.179 --> 00:37:29.179
Well, let's go to Daniel chapter 10, please.

00:37:29.179 --> 00:37:32.179
Let's see one thing that helped Daniel.

00:37:32.179 --> 00:37:36.179
Daniel 10, beginning in verse 18, Daniel says,

00:37:36.179 --> 00:37:42.179
The one who looked like a man touched me again and strengthened me.

00:37:42.179 --> 00:37:47.179
Then he said, Do not be afraid or very precious man.

00:37:47.179 --> 00:37:53.179
May you have peace. Be strong. Yes, be strong.

00:37:53.179 --> 00:37:57.179
As he spoke with me, I was strengthened.

00:37:57.179 --> 00:38:04.179
And I said, Let my Lord speak, for you have strengthened to me.

00:38:04.179 --> 00:38:13.179
So through an angel, Jehovah reassured Daniel that he was precious and still very useful to him.

00:38:13.179 --> 00:38:16.179
Well, Daniel accepted the encouragement, didn't he?

00:38:16.179 --> 00:38:22.179
And thereafter, Jehovah gave him a thrilling prophecy about the King of the North, the King of the South,

00:38:22.179 --> 00:38:26.179
which he recorded for our benefit.

00:38:26.179 --> 00:38:34.179
Although old and infirm, this precious man was still very useful to Jehovah.

00:38:34.179 --> 00:38:55.429
Please watch the following dramatization in which an older brother who feels helpless reflects on how the angel reassured Daniel.

00:38:55.429 --> 00:39:09.940
It all went by so quickly, pioneering, foreign language, circuit work.

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:18.340
There was even a time that I was the one encouraging older ones.

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:23.340
I missed those days so much.

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:31.420
But now, I am the one in a nursing home.

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:35.420
Sometimes, I feel like I have nothing left to offer.

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:51.840
Oh, Daniel, you very precious man. I have been sent to you.

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:59.889
Do not be afraid, Daniel. Your words have been heard from the first day you gave your heart to understanding.

00:39:59.889 --> 00:40:05.889
I have no strength. There's breath left to me.

00:40:05.889 --> 00:40:11.889
Do not be afraid of very precious man. May you have peace. Be strong.

00:40:11.889 --> 00:40:22.710
Be strong. Happy as the one who keeps an expectation.

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:32.710
Go on to the end. You will rest, but you will stand up for your life at the end of the days.

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:36.380
Just checking on you.

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:40.380
Do you have a minute? There's something I've been wanting to share with you.

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:42.380
Okay, sure.

00:40:42.380 --> 00:41:02.429
Yes, Jehovah does remember me, and I still have much to offer.

00:41:02.429 --> 00:41:06.429
That was a very touching video indeed.

00:41:06.429 --> 00:41:11.429
But now we ask, do you have infirmities that keep you from doing what you would like to do?

00:41:11.429 --> 00:41:18.429
If so, reflect on Daniel's example and accept Jehovah's reassurance.

00:41:18.429 --> 00:41:24.429
And remember that what you used to do is still viewed as valuable to Jehovah.

00:41:24.429 --> 00:41:35.429
He will not forget it. And your present acts of faithfulness, even if small, are very precious to him.

00:41:35.429 --> 00:41:46.429
We entreat all of you, whether young or old, like Daniel, do not stop putting up a hard fight for the faith.

00:41:47.429 --> 00:41:54.429
But now, let's talk about today's program, which has the theme taken from Matthew 21-21,

00:41:54.429 --> 00:41:59.429
if you have faith, it will happen.

00:41:59.429 --> 00:42:08.429
In the morning, we enjoyed the faith-strengthening symposium imitate women of strong faith.

00:42:08.429 --> 00:42:18.429
And in each of the eight parts, the exemplary women of faith who were discussed faced mountain-like obstacles.

00:42:18.429 --> 00:42:28.429
Sarah had to leave a comfortable lifestyle for a nomadic lifestyle, and for many years, she suffered barrenness.

00:42:28.429 --> 00:42:38.429
Rehab had to take decisive action, a risk of life, to protect the Israelites' spies, and take a stand with God's people.

00:42:38.429 --> 00:42:43.429
And thereafter, she had to give up on immoral lifestyle.

00:42:43.429 --> 00:42:51.429
Hannah continued to serve Jehovah while enduring many years of barrenness and harassment from Panina.

00:42:51.429 --> 00:43:06.429
The captive Israelite girl was forcibly separated from her family by Syrian marauders, but nevertheless continued to fearlessly witness to others about Jehovah.

00:43:06.429 --> 00:43:15.429
Mary accepted the difficult assignment of giving virtue, caring for, and training God's son.

00:43:15.429 --> 00:43:27.429
The Phoenician woman, courageously and persistently sought help from Jesus for her demon-possessed daughter, and she got that help, didn't she?

00:43:27.429 --> 00:43:38.429
Martha, after the painful loss of her brother to the enemy death, maintained faith and Jesus' ability to raise the dead.

00:43:38.429 --> 00:43:55.429
The two modern day examples that we discussed in the last talk, sisters Issy and Tum, both steadfastly refused to compromise, despite being imprisoned many years, simply because they were Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:43:55.429 --> 00:44:15.429
Yes, each one of these dear sisters faced mountain-like obstacles, but Jehovah rewarded their faith, their faith moved them to expect good things from Jehovah, and Jehovah never, ever left them down.

00:44:15.429 --> 00:44:21.429
Well, what good things do we expect from Jehovah if we maintain strong faith?

00:44:21.429 --> 00:44:26.429
Let's talk about some of the events that we expect to unfold in the near future.

00:44:26.429 --> 00:44:39.429
Now, for one thing, the final part of Nebuchadnezzar's image dream discussed in Daniel 2 will be fulfilled, as represented by the four upper parts of that image,

00:44:40.429 --> 00:44:47.429
four world powers have come and gone just as prophesied.

00:44:47.429 --> 00:45:05.429
Today, the Anglo-American world power symbolized by the feet of iron and clay is dominating, and more than ever we see this last world power living up to being a non-cohesive mixture of iron and clay.

00:45:05.429 --> 00:45:19.429
And just as iron mixed with clay is weaker than solid iron, so too, the Anglo-American world power is weaker than the iron-like Roman power from which it emerged.

00:45:19.429 --> 00:45:33.429
The ability of the Anglo-American world power to act with iron-like strength is weakened by clay-like elements, such as people rising up to claim their rights through insurrection,

00:45:33.429 --> 00:45:39.429
civil rights campaigns, and independence movements.

00:45:39.429 --> 00:45:54.429
As Daniel foretold in chapter 2, verse 42, the kingdom will be partly strong and partly fragile, and we see that more and more evident today than ever.

00:45:54.429 --> 00:46:09.429
But despite the weakened condition of this final world power, it will not simply disintegrate in the self-destruction, go to Daniel chapter 2, and let's notice how it comes to its end.

00:46:09.429 --> 00:46:13.429
Very familiar scripture here, Daniel 2, verse 44,

00:46:14.429 --> 00:46:25.429
In the days of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, and this kingdom will not be passed on any other people.

00:46:25.429 --> 00:46:42.429
It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, and it alone will stand forever, just as you saw that out of the mountain a stone was cut not by hands, that is not by human hands, Jehovah's hands.

00:46:42.429 --> 00:46:49.429
And that it crushed the iron, the copper, the clay, the silver, and the gold.

00:46:49.429 --> 00:46:59.429
The grand god is made known to the king, what will happen in the future? The dream is true, and his interpretation is trustworthy.

00:46:59.429 --> 00:47:11.429
This scripture describes how God's kingdom represented by that stone will crush all human governments at Armageddon.

00:47:11.429 --> 00:47:38.429
And interestingly, in Daniel chapter 2, verse 34, it tells us that the stone, God's kingdom, will strike the image representing human governments in the feet of iron and clay, clearly identifying that Armageddon will come during the time of the American Anglo-World Power, the final human world power.

00:47:38.429 --> 00:47:53.429
And like Daniel, we have strong faith in the last sentence of verse 45, which says the dream is true, and its interpretation is trustworthy. There's no doubt about it.

00:47:53.429 --> 00:48:02.429
God's kingdom will destroy all human governments at Armageddon during the time of the Anglo-American world power.

00:48:02.429 --> 00:48:14.429
But now just as the final part of the image dream will soon be fulfilled, the final part of Daniel's vision in chapter 7 will soon be fulfilled.

00:48:14.429 --> 00:48:34.429
Now in chapter 7, Daniel describes four wild beasts, which symbolize four world powers that have come and gone, and appropriately, they're described as wild beasts, because they haven't ruled kindly, but rather in a harsh, beastly way.

00:48:34.429 --> 00:48:50.429
Now those four world powers are Babylon, Middle Persia, Greece, and Rome, the very same four world powers represented by the four upper metal parts of the image dream we discussed previously.

00:48:50.429 --> 00:49:06.429
But in verse 8, Daniel describes a horn that grew out of the head of that fourth beast out of Rome, and that horn had eyes, and that horn had a mouth, and that mouth spoke arrogantly.

00:49:06.429 --> 00:49:20.429
Well, this arrogant horn symbolizes the Anglo-American world power again, the last world power. Now what was foretold to happen next?

00:49:20.429 --> 00:49:26.429
We'll go to Daniel chapter 7, please. Let's see what happens next.

00:49:26.429 --> 00:49:44.429
Daniel 7, and please, let's begin in verse number 26, but the court sat, and they took away his rulership, that is, that horns rulership, in order to annihilate him and to destroy him completely.

00:49:44.429 --> 00:49:56.429
And the kingdom and the rulership and the grandeur of the kingdoms under all the heavens were given to the people who are the holy ones of the supreme one.

00:49:56.429 --> 00:50:04.429
Their kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all rulerships will serve and obey them.

00:50:04.429 --> 00:50:14.429
The rulership of this arrogant horn is taken away, and it is annihilated and destroyed and replaced by God's kingdom.

00:50:14.429 --> 00:50:31.429
So just as described in the image dream, in this vision, we see that God's kingdom destroys all human governments during the time of the Anglo-American world power and then takes over rulership of the earth.

00:50:31.429 --> 00:50:39.429
How exciting that event, which will take place in the near future, will be.

00:50:39.429 --> 00:50:44.429
But think about it, every preceding part of that prophecy has come true.

00:50:44.429 --> 00:50:53.429
So we have complete confidence, strong faith, that the final part of it will also come true.

00:50:53.429 --> 00:51:03.429
Now there are many other prophecies in the book of Daniel that we didn't have time to discuss that have come true in amazing detail.

00:51:03.429 --> 00:51:13.429
But the fulfillment of so many prophecies totally convinces us that we are deep, deep in the time of the end.

00:51:13.429 --> 00:51:29.429
Very soon we are going to eyewitness the fulfillment of Daniel chapter 12 verse 1, which talks about Michael the great prince standing up, and it will occur a time of great distress.

00:51:29.429 --> 00:51:37.429
But God's people will escape everyone who has found written down in the book.

00:51:37.429 --> 00:51:53.429
In the video near the beginning of this talk, we saw Michael, the glorified Jesus Christ depicted coming with the angels to rescue Jehovah's people and destroy this wicked system.

00:51:53.429 --> 00:52:04.429
Now if you notice carefully in that video, the wicked were actually shooting their weapons into the sky at Michael.

00:52:04.429 --> 00:52:07.429
Now that's laughable isn't it?

00:52:07.429 --> 00:52:15.429
Because mankind's most powerful weapons are like wet firecrackers compared to Michael's mighty power.

00:52:15.429 --> 00:52:23.429
In fact, in the video, Michael was depicted as coming with no defensive equipment such as a breastplate or shield.

00:52:23.429 --> 00:52:25.429
Doesn't need it.

00:52:25.429 --> 00:52:30.429
He was depicted only with a sword and offensive weapon.

00:52:30.429 --> 00:52:35.429
Now sometimes in our illustrations, he's depicted with a bow and arrow.

00:52:35.429 --> 00:52:38.429
Again, only an offensive weapon.

00:52:38.429 --> 00:52:43.429
But his offensive weapons are powerful.

00:52:43.429 --> 00:52:56.429
Much, much more powerful than needed to do the job of rescuing Jehovah's people and sweeping out of existence Satan's entire wicked system.

00:52:56.429 --> 00:53:04.429
But then after Armageddon, the glorious 1000 year reign of Christ Jesus will begin.

00:53:04.429 --> 00:53:12.429
And during that marvelous time, the last verse of the book of Daniel will be fulfilled.

00:53:12.429 --> 00:53:14.429
Now let's read it.

00:53:14.429 --> 00:53:20.429
The last verse of this book, chapter 12, and let's read verse 13.

00:53:20.429 --> 00:53:23.429
And here's what was said to Daniel.

00:53:23.429 --> 00:53:27.429
But as for you, go to the end.

00:53:27.429 --> 00:53:29.429
You will rest.

00:53:29.429 --> 00:53:35.429
But you will stand up for your lot at the end of the days.

00:53:35.429 --> 00:53:40.429
Yes, Daniel served Jehovah faithfully until the end of his life.

00:53:40.429 --> 00:53:42.429
He went to the end, didn't he?

00:53:42.429 --> 00:53:45.429
Now he's resting in death.

00:53:45.429 --> 00:53:56.429
But soon he will stand up in the resurrection during Christ's millennial reign for his lot, his place in the new world.

00:53:56.429 --> 00:54:02.429
But we ask, did Daniel have faith in that promise that Jehovah gave him through the angel?

00:54:02.429 --> 00:54:05.429
For a certainty he did.

00:54:05.429 --> 00:54:08.429
He had already demonstrated faith for decades.

00:54:08.429 --> 00:54:14.429
He remained clean when tempted to eat food that would defile him.

00:54:14.429 --> 00:54:20.429
He was diligent in prayer, even when praying meant that he would be executed.

00:54:20.429 --> 00:54:25.429
He never stopped building his faith through Bible study.

00:54:25.429 --> 00:54:28.429
So we can be sure he believed with all his heart.

00:54:28.429 --> 00:54:38.429
That promise Jehovah gave him through the angel that he would stand up in the resurrection and take his place in the new world.

00:54:38.429 --> 00:54:45.429
But now we ask, how can we maintain our faith as Daniel did?

00:54:45.429 --> 00:54:52.429
Well, by staying morally and spiritually clean, not allowing anything to corrupt our faith.

00:54:52.429 --> 00:54:59.429
By praying constantly with full confidence that Jehovah will answer our prayers.

00:54:59.429 --> 00:55:05.429
And by listening to Jehovah by diligent study of his word.

00:55:05.429 --> 00:55:11.429
Jehovah wants us to have faith that he is our rewarder.

00:55:11.429 --> 00:55:19.429
Hebrews 116 says, whoever approaches God must believe that he is, that he's really there,

00:55:19.429 --> 00:55:26.429
and that he becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him.

00:55:26.429 --> 00:55:30.429
Think about our two brothers shown earlier in this talk.

00:55:31.429 --> 00:55:35.429
The Christian father and the sick brother.

00:55:35.429 --> 00:55:42.429
The Christian father ended up behind bars, and our sick brother was not miraculously healed.

00:55:42.429 --> 00:55:48.429
So was their faith in vain for a certainty no?

00:55:48.429 --> 00:55:53.429
Will Jehovah reward them for a certainty yes?

00:55:53.429 --> 00:55:59.429
If you are facing a similar situation, will Jehovah reward you?

00:55:59.429 --> 00:56:02.429
Most definitely yes.

00:56:02.429 --> 00:56:11.429
Please watch the following video, which features the song that we will sing to conclude our convention.

00:56:11.429 --> 00:56:35.099
Enjoy this video.

00:57:27.530 --> 00:59:21.679
We look forward to singing that song to conclude our convention.

01:00:45.530 --> 01:00:52.530
Dear brothers and sisters, faithful children, cherished interested ones.

01:00:52.530 --> 01:00:58.530
There's no doubt. Right now, we face powerful enemies.

01:00:58.530 --> 01:01:06.530
For one thing, we have a powerful enemy inside our bodies, inherited sin.

01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:12.530
It wages an intense war against our desire to do what is right.

01:01:12.530 --> 01:01:19.530
Secondly, we have the formidable foes, Satan, and his demons.

01:01:19.530 --> 01:01:31.530
Satan is described as a devouring lion, a cunning serpent, a fierce dragon, a sneaky bird catcher, and he's given other evil descriptions.

01:01:31.530 --> 01:01:35.530
Ephesians 6.12 says we have a struggle.

01:01:35.530 --> 01:01:43.530
The footnote literally arrestsling against the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places.

01:01:43.530 --> 01:01:57.530
As mentioned in our publications, there may be tens of thousands of these powerful, evil spirit creatures in the invisible realm, waging war against us.

01:01:57.530 --> 01:02:09.530
Thirdly, we have this wicked world all around us that is trying to assimilate us into joining them in ungodly conduct.

01:02:09.530 --> 01:02:20.530
And looking at the ratio, we as Jehovah's people are outnumbered by people of the world by about 900 to 1.

01:02:20.530 --> 01:02:39.530
But despite the power of those three great enemies, our faith, this product of Jehovah's invincible Holy Spirit, makes us stronger and stronger individually than all of those three enemies combined.

01:02:39.530 --> 01:02:46.900
In the near future, another powerful enemy will come against us.

01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:54.900
This formidable foe is a coalition of nations called Gog in Ezekiel 38.

01:02:54.900 --> 01:03:03.900
And Ezekiel 38 says that Gog will come with a great assembly of vast army like clouds covering the land.

01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:07.900
They will come against God's people.

01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:11.900
Now, this could be a very intimidating situation.

01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:24.900
But dear brothers and sisters, your faith will make you stronger than Gog and will keep you stronger until Jehovah miraculously intervenes at Armageddon.

01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:28.900
And if you think about it, Armageddon really is a rescue operation.

01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:38.900
He will intervene and he will sweep attacking Gog away forever with a broom of annihilation.

01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:47.900
In the past, faith has helped Gog's people to overcome the most powerful obstacles.

01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:52.900
And that same product of Holy Spirit will help us do the same.

01:03:52.900 --> 01:04:07.900
Yes, throughout the centuries, just like today, God's servants such as Daniel have been made powerful, not by natural strength, but through faith.

01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:20.900
So dear brothers and sisters, faithful children, cherished interested ones, pray earnestly for faith, put up a hard fight to maintain your faith,

01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:36.900
and trust with all your heart that if you have faith, maintain your faith, walk by faith, you definitely will see all of Jehovah's promises fulfilled.
