00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.480
Irina is collecting provisions for her husband, Dennis Christensen.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.480
Over two years have passed since he was detained in the city of Aurel.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.480
They allow 30 kilograms each month, so I bring him whatever he asks for.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.480
He loves marzipan, so I bring him sweets made from marzipan.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:34.270
It all began on May 25, 2017, when armed men and masks raided a religious service.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:42.270
About 15 women, special forces and about 10 FSB officers burst in.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:49.270
We didn't know what to do or how to act, because everyone wanted to record everything, but we weren't allowed to.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.270
Dennis was arrested right there and then.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:02.270
On the very next day, restrictive measures were imposed on Dennis Christensen in a form of detention.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.269
The investigation was intensive in the case against Christensen.

00:01:07.269 --> 00:01:15.269
The investigator ordered 13 expert studies, several handwriting studies, a religious and a linguistic study,

00:01:15.269 --> 00:01:19.269
and strangely a psychological psychiatric study.

00:01:19.269 --> 00:01:22.269
Additionally, there were of course interrogations.

00:01:22.269 --> 00:01:25.269
I think around 100 people were interrogated.

00:01:25.269 --> 00:01:30.269
Their main name was to do everything quickly and as ruthlessly as possible.

00:01:31.269 --> 00:01:38.269
At the end of February 2018, nine months after his arrest, the court hearing began.

00:01:38.269 --> 00:01:47.269
Dozens of fellow worshippers came to the Rolesna Dorozhne district court in Aurel to support Dennis Christensen and his wife.

00:01:47.269 --> 00:01:51.269
In the last year, I've seen him three times a week in the court room.

00:01:51.269 --> 00:01:59.269
Thanks to his demeanor, a positive, even joyful atmosphere prevailed at the court hearings.

00:02:00.269 --> 00:02:05.269
For example, he showed drawings made by children that had been sent to him from all over the world.

00:02:05.269 --> 00:02:08.270
He happily accepted greetings that his friends sent him.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.270
It was obvious that he was really happy to see everyone who came to the hearings.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.270
Thank you for supporting me. I'm very glad that you're here.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.270
The Bible was read many times and we read entire paragraphs from our books.

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:32.270
We watched videos, studied the entire 2017 yearbook and all the meeting workbooks from 2017.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.270
Everything the prosecutor's office had filed as evidence was read out.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.270
We sang songs just like at the meetings. It was quite amusing.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.270
The situation was rather paradoxical.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.270
A person is being accused of extremism, but he's displaying no hostility whatsoever.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.270
Even toward those who are unjustly accusing him.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:03:03.270
The entire court case, which lasted for almost a year, left no doubt that Dennis Christensen had not committed a single crime.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:10.270
The fact is that our position and mainly the position of Christensen himself was to prove his innocence.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.270
And it was obvious that in reality he was innocent.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.270
But as we were in court, we had to defend our position and present evidence.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:29.270
Generally, to conduct this type of case, you have to understand this sense of the person's religious convictions.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:34.270
And why he acts the way he does. Why does he attend religious meetings?

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.270
Is it because he considers himself to be a member of a legal entity?

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:44.270
Or is it because he considers it a means of exercising his right to freedom of worship?

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.270
Here you have a crime that is punishable by up to ten years of imprisonment

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.270
and tastes are trying to establish who was responsible for cleaning a building.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.270
Who purchased the maps and the racks for the cleaning?

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:02.270
Why Christensen unlocked the gates and why he cleared snow? It is mind-boggling.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.620
It was amazing that so many people came to hear the word.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.620
And I know that many came from other cities.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.620
From Moscow, Belgrade, Kurs, Galuga, Delets.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.620
And those are just a few, the ones I personally met.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.620
My husband did not deserve the verdict because he is an excellent person

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.620
and has spent his life helping other people, not harming them.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.620
He has never incited anyone to violence.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.620
The court could not name a single specific action

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.620
that the accused had committed that post a real danger to society.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.620
In my opinion, the decision doesn't reflect the feelings of the judge himself

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:13.620
because to any sensible person, especially to someone who has examined the issue at stake,

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:19.620
it is obvious that there are no extremist organizations involved here and no extremists.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.620
And naturally, it is frightening that a punishment of this nature

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.620
has been handed down to a person just for his religious beliefs.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.620
It is very harsh.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.620
So it looks more like just an attack on a person with religious beliefs

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.620
who is from a minority religion.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.620
This unprecedented verdict handed down against Dennis Christensen

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.620
has resulted in wide publicity.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.620
Russian and international organizations have called on the Russian authorities

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.620
to release this believer and drop all the charges against him.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:56.620
Human rights advocates have described the verdict as unlawful and monstrous.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.620
I would put it very simply with this monstrous, just monstrous,

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.620
that people are being sentenced.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:09.620
Not for what they have done, but for they are being part of an organization, for their beliefs.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.620
This is absolutely monstrous.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.620
I think that the court has found itself in a difficult position

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.620
because it could not prove anything extremist whatsoever.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.620
There isn't anything. Absolutely nothing.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.620
It goes without saying that this is a shameful reflection

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.620
on Russia's official policy toward religion.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.620
We consider that Russia is a religious country,

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.620
even more religious than European countries.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.620
So how could persecution of religious believers happen in such a country?

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.620
How did it come about?

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.620
People with sincere beliefs should have the right to practice them,

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.620
and obviously they should never be persecuted for it.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.620
It is one of the most fundamental constitutional human rights.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.620
And I consider that he won the case.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.620
He won because in court he was far more convincing

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.620
and looked far better than the judge or the prosecutor.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.620
In my opinion, the judge understood this too.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.620
And it is well known that all religions become stronger

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.620
as a result of persecution.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:16.620
Those who maintain their faith as many of them do,

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:22.620
become even more determined and more willing to stand up for their beliefs.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.620
Human rights advocates, lawyers and participants in the proceedings

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.620
said the same thing at the press conference

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.620
that took place in Moscow two days after the verdict.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:37.620
It is not worthy that Denis turned his final statement

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.620
to the court into a sermon.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.620
What was the outcome?

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.620
Basically all 50 persons who were in court,

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:49.620
including the prosecutor, the judge, myself and the media,

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:54.620
became participants in a religious service.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.620
All I can say is that Jehovah's Witnesses

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.620
have done nothing to deserve such treatment.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.620
Nothing that they do weren't imprisonment

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.620
or charges of extremism.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.620
My husband is a strong person and can cope.

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.620
He has strong faith, so our God will support him

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.620
and always help him, just as he has supported me

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.620
for the past almost two years.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:21.620
The press conference that took place recently in Moscow

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:24.620
was an amazing event, and I could never have imagined myself

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.620
in the company of such well-respected individuals.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:31.620
After the press conference, each one of them said something nice to me,

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.620
words of support, encouragement,

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.620
or they related their own personal experiences

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.620
about what they had gone through

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.620
and how they understand how I feel.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:45.620
Irina related how the thousands of letters and drawings

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.620
sent to her and her husband from all over the world

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.620
have been a great encouragement.

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:56.620
He devised a plan to hand all the children's drawings on the wall,

00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:00.620
so plastic covers together

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.620
and made what was like a stand

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:06.620
so that he could display several pictures at once.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:11.620
He puts up every new picture for at least a day,

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:14.620
and when they come to inspect the cell each day,

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.620
they look at the children's pictures.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:22.620
Dennis says he wants to tell the children that their drawings

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.620
were on the wall in the detention facility,

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.620
and the sheer number of letters he receives each day

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:31.620
has stunned everyone in the detention facility,

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:35.620
because, as they say, no one has ever received this many.

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:39.620
According to Irina, Dennis writes her several letters each week,

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.620
and in each of them, he finds words of support for her

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:45.620
and shares encouraging thoughts with her.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:48.620
Staying positive is a key to success,

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.620
and we have so many reasons to be joyful,

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:54.620
proclaiming Jehovah's name in our city is an honor, isn't it?

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:58.620
And upholding Jehovah's grand sovereignty is the reason for our existence.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.620
I know that our journey is a long one,

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:03.620
and we have not won the victory, not yet,

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:06.620
but we will eventually come up victorious.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:09.620
Of that, I am 100% certain.

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:14.620
Irina hopes that the appeal court will release her husband from imprisonment,

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:17.620
but, in her words, no matter what the outcome,

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:20.620
she will continue to support Dennis.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.620
It's one thing, if he were there,

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:26.620
because he has murdered or assaulted or robbed someone,

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.620
but being in detention for his beliefs,

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:31.620
well, that's another thing.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.620
He is there with a clean conscience,

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.620
with a positive outlook,

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.620
because he hasn't done anything bad to anyone.

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.620
So I have always been proud of my husband,

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.620
and I still am.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:47.620
And I understand what an honor it is to go through it all with such dignity,

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:49.620
and so calmly and confidently.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.620
Thank you for coming.

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.620
I really appreciate it. Thank you.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:58.620
Jesus Christ stated that his followers would be persecuted,

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.620
so it is no surprise that this has happened.

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.620
We should expect it.

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:08.620
With God's help, we can get through any trial, absolutely any.

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:10.620
Whatever form it may take.
