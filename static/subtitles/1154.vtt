00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:10.089
Rice and beans, you can eat them with just about anything and they will be delicious.

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:12.089
What about kimchi?

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:17.829
It's a dish of fermented vegetables with a variety of seasonings, producing a complex taste

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:20.969
of sour and spicy.

00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:25.010
And y'all of rice, so flavor-some.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:33.429
This is cooked in an appetizing tomato and pepper puree, laced with chili for a zesty taste.

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:42.549
And at the end of a day of hard work, how about a piece of sweet, fruity, cool watermelon?

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:45.869
It's wonderfully refreshing.

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:53.990
All over planet Earth, there are a vast variety of nutritious, delicious, and refreshing foods.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.350
What is what God has provided?

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:04.049
It is just as the Bible says, please read along with me at Ecclesiastes chapter 3, verses

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.079
12 and 13.

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:14.120
I have concluded that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice and to do good doing

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.000
their life.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Also that everyone should eat and drink and find enjoyment for all his hard work.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.159
Think is the gift of God.

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.560
No doubt you enjoy your favorite foods.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.280
Your mouth may be watering just from thinking about it.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.120
As much as we enjoy eating individually, when we share a good meal with family and friends,

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.920
it's a special time.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.799
In the following video, note how Jehovah's Provision of Food gives evidence that he wants

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:57.250
us to enjoy life.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.620
Our tongue can detect five basic tastes.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:24.879
There is sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and the rich savoury taste called umami, but we

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:33.830
enjoy not just five flavors, but possibly over a hundred thousand.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.509
How?

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:41.030
As we chew, we also smell our food.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:48.189
Doing releases aromas that pass up into our nose through the back of our throat.

00:02:48.189 --> 00:03:02.000
Taste and smell then combine to make the flavors we enjoy.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.479
Our taste buds develop before we're born.

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:14.360
As an unborn baby swallows amniotic fluid, it may taste with its mother eats, and is

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.750
more likely to enjoy the same food she does.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.870
We don't eat just to survive.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.349
We love to eat.

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:34.960
It makes us happy.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:45.069
The Bible says why that everyone should eat and drink and find enjoyment for all his

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:46.069
hard work.

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:55.919
It is the gift of God.

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:02.400
We are made so that we must take in physical food regularly in order to survive.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.719
Yet how grateful we are that our Creator has made eating so enjoyable.

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:17.160
That reflects the way of Jehovah, fulfilling our needs creates joy, not dread.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.639
You will not find a normal individual complaining about eating a good dinner.

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.240
No, rather, it's enjoyable.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:33.079
Now turn with me, please, to Matthew chapter 4, and notice another vital need we have

00:04:33.079 --> 00:04:36.199
that relates to food.

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:48.480
Matthew 4, 4, it says, it is written, man must live not on bread alone, but on every

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.920
word that comes from Jehovah's mouth.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.000
We need physical food to stay alive, and we enjoy doing so.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.319
But the same is true with spiritual food.

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:04.920
We need it to stay alive spiritually.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:12.160
So just as it's true with physical food, when we partake of spiritual food, we find true

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.160
joy.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.600
Isn't that what Jesus said in his introduction to the Sermon on the Mount?

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:24.319
Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need?

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:32.600
The beauty of Jehovah's way is that he has made the satisfying of our spiritual need enjoyable.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.199
Why do we say that?

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:42.360
Because God's word, the Bible, is written in a way that is appealing to us.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.040
In his great wisdom, he used humans to write the Bible.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.519
Think about it.

00:05:47.519 --> 00:05:52.519
If, for example, he had used angels, would they have been able to convey the emotions

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:56.240
and feelings with a human touch?

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:04.160
Words convey not just information, but emotion, such as fear, sorrow, and disappointment,

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:11.160
by allowing imperfect men to choose the wording for the ideas they received through Holy Spirit.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:20.160
God conveyed his message with warmth, variety, and the appeal of human emotions and feelings.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.160
That makes his word appealing to us humans.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:32.160
In addition to that, Jehovah provides a variety of spiritual food in abundance.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:42.160
But taking in spiritual food requires effort just as it takes in preparing and eating a delicious meal.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:50.160
Rice and beans, kimchi, and Jehovah's rice each take time and effort to prepare.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.160
It takes effort to plant, cultivate, and pick watermelon.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:59.160
But what a joy it is to experience the results of such efforts.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:05.160
What can we do to make the study of God's word more enjoyable?

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:12.160
When reading the Bible, do so allowed in a lively manner.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:18.160
But when we do that, we experience what Psalm 1 verse 2 says.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:28.160
His delight is in the law of Jehovah, and he reads his law in an undertone day and night.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.160
Take time to do research and to meditate.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:39.160
By being creative, you can make personal study and family study meaningful and satisfying.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:49.160
When reading the Bible, imagine the sounds, the sights, the smells, and the appearance of the events.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:54.160
The August 15, 2011 watchtower said,

00:07:54.160 --> 00:08:02.160
It is not the intention of the governing body to establish one format for all families.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:13.160
Since circumstances vary, it is appropriate for each family head or individual to evaluate how this weekly occasion can be used in the best way.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:19.160
In other words, make family and personal worship an enjoyable time.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:26.160
It may not always be necessary or even desirable to use a question and answer method.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:32.159
A relaxed atmosphere is more conducive to a lively and stimulating discussion.

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:35.159
It promotes creative thinking.

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:39.159
We marvel at Jehovah's love and wisdom.

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:44.159
Not only has He given us life and the means to sustain it,

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:49.159
but He has also given us the ability to find pleasure in doing so.

00:08:49.159 --> 00:08:57.500
Due to human rulership, many today do not receive adequate amounts of physical food.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:06.500
But the day is near when our loving creator will see to it that everyone alive will have an abundance of food and drink.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:19.500
In the meantime, may all of us deserve Jehovah's love for us and enjoy the food and drink that we do have and the abundance of spiritual food.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:27.940
With such perfect gifts, we look forward to enjoying life forever.

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:33.940
Brother Harold Corker, a helper to the publishing committee, will now present the next talk of this symposium.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:38.940
Creation proves that Jehovah wants us to rejoice beautiful colors.
