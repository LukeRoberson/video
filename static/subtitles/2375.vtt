00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.429
Energy is essential to life on Earth.

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:22.179
Living things must acquire energy

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:25.179
and manage it properly.

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:30.719
This enables creatures to live in extreme climates,

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:35.719
move with speed and travel vast distances.

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:43.729
The wandering albatross flies thousands of kilometers

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:45.729
to find food.

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:49.729
But it can stay up in the air for days at a time

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:51.729
rarely flapping its wings.

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:53.729
How?

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:57.729
It rides the wind like a roller coaster,

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:59.729
diving toward the water,

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:04.730
turning, rising in repeated arcs.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.730
This efficient use of the wind's energy

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.730
is known as dynamic soaring.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.730
The albatross has the longest wingspan of any bird,

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.730
about 3.5 meters or over 11 feet.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.730
It has a special tendon for each shoulder

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.730
enabling it to lock its wings in place at will,

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.730
like an aeroplane's fixed wings.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.730
Because of this, it doesn't tire out

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.730
from keeping those long wings extended

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:48.340
and can continue that pattern virtually without end.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.340
Other birds carefully conserve energy

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.340
to stay warm and cold conditions.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.340
They stand and walk on ice

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.340
for extended periods of time without freezing.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.340
How?

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.340
As their blood circulates,

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.340
energy is transferred through a process known

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.340
as counter-current heat exchange.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.340
If a warm fluid runs in the same direction

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.340
alongside a cool fluid,

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.340
at best 50% of the heat is transmitted.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.340
But if the fluids run in opposite directions,

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.340
nearly all of the heat is transmitted.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.340
The veins and arteries in the legs of sea girls,

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.340
geese, and penguins act this way.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.879
This highly efficient system maintains

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.879
the body's core temperature,

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.879
while leaving just enough heat in the bird's feet

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:48.879
to keep them from freezing.

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:55.250
But what about creatures facing the opposite extreme?

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.250
What if instead of conserving energy,

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.250
they need to lose some?

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.250
Silver ants of the Sahara Desert

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.250
live in one of their hottest places on Earth.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.250
They forage for food when temperatures on the desert floor

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.250
are as high as 70 degrees Celsius

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.250
or 158 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:26.590
To survive, they reflect and dissipate energy.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.590
The secret is its hair.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.590
While some animals rely on hair to keep warm,

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.590
the silver ant uses its hair to stay cool.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.590
How?

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.590
The ants' hairs are triangular-shaped tubes.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.590
Like carefully crafted prisms,

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.590
they reflect the hottest wavelengths of sunlight

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.590
and dissipate heat.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.900
Some researchers think it may tolerate heat

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.900
better than any other animal on the planet.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:08.430
In the natural world, animals acquire, conserve,

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.430
and manage energy in remarkably efficient ways.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.430
What do you think?

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.430
Did the ability of animals to manage energy evolve

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.430
or was it designed?
