00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:08.640
Good morning, brothers and sisters, how delightful it is to be gathered together for this spiritual occasion.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:18.640
Jehovah's Witnesses love gathering at conventions, to learn, worship, and sing together.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.640
But large conventions like these, with tens of thousands beating together,

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.640
weren't always a part of our modern day worship, how did they get started?

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.640
Let's find out in this episode of Our History in Motion.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.700
The very first large assembly of Jehovah's people was actually held thousands of years ago,

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.700
when the Israelites gathered with Moses at Mount Sinai for spiritual instruction.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.700
After that, the Israelites attended three festivals each year,

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.700
and just like today's conventions, those gatherings brought people together from different tribes

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.700
to praise him as one big family.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.700
In modern times, our first conventions were held in the late 1880s,

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.700
but they weren't exactly what we'd think of as conventions today.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.700
With just a few hundred in attendance, they were really just big meetings that brought the Bible students together

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.700
to commemorate the Lord's evening meal.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.700
And they were all held in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, USA.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.700
But that changed in 1893, with the opening of the Chicago World's Fair.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.700
The fair drew millions of people, and with the railroads offering discounted rates to Chicago,

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.700
the Bible students saw it as a perfect opportunity to invite the brothers and sisters for a five-day convention.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.700
About 360 attended, a small crowd by today's standards.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:08.699
But early conventions like this one helped the Bible students see just how a building it was to meet with fellow believers from other areas.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:13.699
Eventually, conventions became an annual event.

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:23.699
Some were held outdoors, or in a tent, like the 1908 Convention at Putin Bay, a summer resort on Lake Iriohio.

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:33.699
This convention was ten days long, and it was the largest up to that time, with an estimated 3,500 or more in attendance.

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:47.699
It was a chance for brothers and sisters, young and old, to be spiritually refreshed, spend time together, laugh together, eat together, and build true bonds of friendship and love.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:03:00.430
The world then suffered the devastating effects of World War I and the deadly 1918 influenza pandemic that had taken an estimated 50 million lives.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.430
But that did not stop God's people.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.430
Our bonds of love became even more evident in 1919 at Cedar Point, Ohio.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:17.430
This was the first major convention held after brother Rutherford and his associates had been released from prison.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:30.430
Thrilled, to finally gather together safely, the Bible students just kept coming and coming until the entire program had to be moved outdoors, with some 7,000 in attendance.

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:46.379
Just three years later, in 1922, Cedar Point was the location of an even more exciting convention, with an average daily attendance of about 10,000.

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:52.379
It energized God's people to go on preaching with renewed vigor.

00:03:53.379 --> 00:04:05.379
Many conventions in the years that followed helped unite God's people in even more powerful ways, like the unforgettable one held in Columbus, Ohio in 1931.

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:15.379
Imagine stepping into the Colosseum at the fairgrounds. There are 15,000 in attendance and the places packed.

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:21.379
Your program has two large letters printed on the front, J.W.

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:27.379
For the first two days of the convention, everyone's trying to guess what those letters mean.

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:30.379
Just watch. Just wait.

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:34.379
Finally, brother Rutherford steps on stage.

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:40.379
Near the end of his talk, he presents a resolution that climaxes with the words,

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:49.379
we desire to be known as and called by the name to wit Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.800
In the 1940s, World War II had left many countries devastated and divided.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.800
But Jehovah's Witnesses were growing in number and in unity.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:16.800
In 1946, they gathered in Cleveland, Ohio for the Glad Nation's Theocratic Assembly and the name couldn't have been more appropriate.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:26.800
It was a true international convention with 55,000 delegates from 33 different nations.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:34.800
Some even camped in tents and trailers to be there. Tent cities were a common sight during big conventions of this era.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:43.800
With our spiritual family continuing to grow, conventions during the 1950s were held around the world,

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.800
even in places where resources were limited.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:06:00.800
A landmark example of just how international conventions had become was the incredible 1958 Divine Will International Assembly in New York City,

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:07.800
which was attended by more than a quarter of a million people from 123 lands.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:17.800
This was the largest international convention ever held in one city, building Yankee Stadium and just four blocks away, the polo grounds.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:28.800
The greatest assembly of true Christians ever held is opening this day. We are certain that Jehovah is with us and that we are here by Divine Will.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:37.430
But what unified God's people at conventions like this one wasn't simply gathering together in large numbers.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:51.430
It was the spiritual content, riveting talks, practical symposiums, new releases and starting in the 1960s, Bible dramas on stage in full costume.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:07:02.430
Those spiritual gifts along with the joy of meeting new friends and uniting with old ones have made assembling together a true blessing.

00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:19.839
But it hasn't always been easy. In the country of Georgia, where witnesses had faced severe opposition, plans were set to hold the 2006 deliverance at hand, district convention in the Tbilisi Philharmonic Concert Hall.

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:26.839
But the hall management cancelled the contract just one week before the convention.

00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:36.839
With just days before the opening session, an army of determined brothers and sisters turned two plots of farmland into a convention site.

00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:46.839
Harvesting the potatoes planted on the property, building a stage in benches for seating and installing sound equipment.

00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:57.839
When it was time for the first session, everything was ready and more than 17,000 attended either on site or by telephone tie-in.

00:07:58.839 --> 00:08:08.839
Not only did the convention come off without a hitch, but the attendees were overwhelmed with another unexpected blessing, the New World translation in Georgian.

00:08:09.839 --> 00:08:14.839
Unifying them even further with their brothers and sisters around the world.

00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:27.839
In modern times like these, special and international conventions have been held in far-flung places around the world. And when it was impossible to meet in person, we've even met online.

00:08:29.839 --> 00:08:40.840
From Poland to Korea, from Australia to South Africa, conventions were and still are joyful spiritual occasions for all of God's people.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:49.840
They motivate and encourage us, united as brothers and sisters, and most importantly, draw us closer to Jehovah.
