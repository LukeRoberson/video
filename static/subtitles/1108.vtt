WEBVTT

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.449
Got it.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.649
I find the answers in all that.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.649
It's more than just the answers.

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:28.850
And with it, I'm all about study.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.570
Which do you remember more from our studies?

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:35.969
The answers?

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.369
Or the things that touch your heart?

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:42.740
Yeah.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.939
Like, when we talked about immorality,

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:47.939
you knew the answer.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.340
But you didn't seem totally convinced.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.140
You'll hear.

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:59.049
Let's try and find that answer.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.299
But whoever practices sexual immorality

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.700
is sinning against his own body.

00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:20.019
Not sure why,

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.180
but it made me think of Mum and Dad.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.780
His constant cheating, actually.

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:30.180
Mum's humiliation,

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.980
the divorce, all the misery.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.180
I didn't want that.

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:44.540
I began to realise

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:46.540
how right Jehovah is.

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.939
Because of what need to call meditation.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.140
It's not about clearing your mind to find inner peace.

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:57.340
It's totally different.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.540
It's asking

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.340
how Jehovah feels about something.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.340
And then what that means for me.

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:16.159
Yeah.

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:18.360
I sister died in that attack.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.759
It was really sad.

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:22.159
That's time and unexpected events.

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:24.759
Well,

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.759
it's one of those cases.

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:28.560
What about when someone survives

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.759
because they're at the meeting?

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:30.759
That's...

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.360
I don't get it.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:34.960
Straight answer.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.560
Does Jehovah protect witnesses or not?

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:38.759
Funny.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.360
My meeting part tonight covers that point.

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:43.159
Why don't you come?

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:46.159
You're really pushing those meetings, aren't you?

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:51.530
What time?

00:02:51.530 --> 00:03:52.360
But I missed her part.

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:54.560
But...

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:56.759
it wasn't a total loss.

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:03.469
Nita had said,

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.669
at the hall,

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:06.069
everyone loves one another.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:11.860
I felt it.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.659
I had no idea.

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:17.180
I told her I'd be back.

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:27.040
Do not be misled.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.639
Bad associations,

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:30.439
spoil useful habits.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.800
Okay, but...

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.000
what's good associations?

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:37.000
Well,

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:38.800
we have wholesome gatherings

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.800
with our brothers and sisters from the congregation.

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:43.399
And we eat, and talk.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.800
And some like to play musical instruments.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.000
And they'll do...

00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:49.199
Renditions of original songs.

00:04:49.399 --> 00:05:01.089
And we have a really nice time.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.089
Yeah.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.889
I don't do that.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:05.490
It's not boring.

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:07.490
Sure, it's not.

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:09.689
Well, what do you do?

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:34.199
You wouldn't do that.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.000
It's not exactly wholesome.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.000
But you've got to have fun, right?

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:40.000
True.

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:41.000
And...

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.800
we do.

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:44.600
See for yourself.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.000
I'm having some people over this weekend.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.800
Why don't you come?

00:05:49.000 --> 00:06:23.709
It wasn't the club.

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.509
But it was still fun.

00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:47.199
Neeter and I talked about it.

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:50.000
Part of me felt a bit scared.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.600
Part a bit crazy.

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:54.800
Me knocking on doors.

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:00.069
But I knew this was the right thing to do.

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:02.470
A minister should also be free

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:04.870
from all non-medical use of addictive

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.870
or mind-altering substances.

00:07:07.269 --> 00:07:08.470
Non-medical.

00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:14.930
But taking something when I'm feeling a little stressed.

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:18.730
Like, maybe I don't know.

00:07:19.329 --> 00:07:20.329
A little weed?

00:07:22.529 --> 00:07:23.930
That's okay, right?

00:07:25.329 --> 00:07:27.529
And it's for the stress.

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:35.420
I guess I didn't quite understand what medical men...

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.620
So we've seen you during the week.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:37.620
Yeah, okay.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:38.220
Thank you, Johnny.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:38.819
Thanks.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.720
We'll be back.

00:07:43.319 --> 00:07:45.519
You can guess what our next few studies were about.

00:07:45.519 --> 00:07:48.120
And you should continue to be made new

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.720
in your dominant mental attitude.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.120
Knowing it was wrong was easy.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.740
Figuring out how to cope without it

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:12.300
wasn't eating it.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.500
Felt impossible.

00:08:15.699 --> 00:08:38.000
It deserved a hover.

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:41.649
Felt amazing.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:09:27.909
Listen, I really don't want to disappoint her.

00:09:27.909 --> 00:09:31.409
I can't disappoint your hover.

00:09:31.409 --> 00:09:32.409
Of course.

00:09:33.409 --> 00:09:34.610
You loved them both.

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:37.610
Don't you think you can help you?

00:09:39.649 --> 00:09:40.649
Talk to him.

00:09:46.669 --> 00:09:49.669
I spent a long time pouring out my heart to him.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.700
And I remembered something from one of the Psalms.

00:10:08.019 --> 00:10:09.620
I will walk in your truth.

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.620
Unifying my heart to fear your name.

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:12.049
Remember someone wants claiming to be all about the promises.

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:14.049
Made any good ones lately?

00:11:14.649 --> 00:11:15.649
Absolutely.
