00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.000
What do you think?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:11.320
Is there a connection, a relationship between love and peace?

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.760
And if so, what role does love play in achieving genuine peace?

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:26.800
The Bible helps us to appreciate that love is an essential element in achieving genuine

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.899
peace.

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:34.560
So we're interested in showing love.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:41.159
As students of the Bible, we know that humans were created in the image of God, and as a result,

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:46.240
you and I have the ability to show love.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:52.520
But we also know that we live in a world that has a very distorted view and definition

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.399
of love.

00:00:54.399 --> 00:01:00.359
That combined with our own imperfection means that if we're not careful, our view of

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.319
love can become distorted.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:08.079
So how do we guard against that?

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:14.200
By allowing Jehovah to teach us how to love.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.280
And when you think about it, what better teacher could we have?

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.959
The Bible says that God is love.

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:29.599
That means that Jehovah, our Creator, who knows us better than we know ourselves, who

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:37.239
embodies, who personifies love, is willing to teach us how to love.

00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:39.280
And how does he do that?

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:46.840
Well by means of his word, the Bible, and by means of his own beautiful example, as we

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.840
get acquainted with Jehovah, we learn what love really is.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:02.719
And as we put that love to work, as Jesus did, then we're in a position to enjoy genuine

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.319
peace.

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:14.000
In this symposium, we're going to explore how love for God, love of neighbor, and love

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.439
for God's word, the Bible, can lead to genuine peace.

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:23.639
First, let's talk about love for God.

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:29.599
How important is that if we want to enjoy genuine peace?

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:35.280
Well, Jesus provides some insight and a statement he made that's recorded in our Bibles

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.319
at Matthew chapter 22.

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:38.800
Let's look at it.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.319
Matthew chapter 22, and we're going to read verse 37.

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:52.759
Now to provide some context for these words, Jesus has been asked a question by a man who

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:55.639
is well versed in the law.

00:02:55.639 --> 00:03:00.319
What is the greatest commandment in the law?

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.520
Notice how Jesus responds.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:12.240
He said to him, you must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.439
soul and with your whole mind.

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:21.840
This is the greatest and first commandment.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:30.949
You must love Jehovah your God, the command, love for Jehovah is essential.

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:38.069
It has to be the most important relationship in our life, more important than any human,

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.110
more important than anything.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.270
We want to love Jehovah to what extent?

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:52.389
Well, Jesus says with your whole heart, and what does that involve?

00:03:52.389 --> 00:04:00.110
The context of Jesus' words helps us to understand that he was talking about a person's feelings,

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.110
emotions, desires.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.710
So does love for God involve our emotions?

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.909
Absolutely.

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:14.629
And it has to involve more than a simple affection for God.

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:15.949
Why do we say that?

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:19.509
Well, what did Jesus say next?

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:21.670
With your whole soul.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.949
That is with your entire being.

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:33.750
We use everything we have to praise Jehovah and to prove our love for him.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.350
But even more is involved.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.670
Jesus concludes by saying with your whole mind.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.589
So our intellectual faculties are involved.

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:53.790
We're willing to take the time to get to know Jehovah's thinking and make it our thinking.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.790
We want to think the way Jehovah thinks.

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:03.949
We want to understand his purpose and his requirements for us.

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:08.790
And we want to understand his personality.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:18.189
When we think about that kind of love, it's clear that it encompasses our thoughts,

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:21.709
our words, and our actions.

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:24.829
Nothing is left out.

00:05:24.829 --> 00:05:32.870
And that kind of love provides a basis for a friendship with God.

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.350
And that results in peace with God.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.110
So there we see the progression.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:50.670
Loving Jehovah with our whole heart, soul, and mind leads to peace with God.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:58.670
And as we enjoy peace with God, we can also enjoy inner peace and peace with those around

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:59.670
us.

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.670
Now, how does that work?

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:07.069
Well, our love for Jehovah motivates us to imitate him.

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:13.829
And we cultivate the qualities that Jehovah displays.

00:06:13.829 --> 00:06:23.589
For example, patience, kindness, mildness, qualities that make us attractive to others

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:29.829
and qualities that promote peace with others.

00:06:29.829 --> 00:06:37.560
I'm sure you would agree that we want to be at peace with God.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:42.160
But sometimes our peace can be threatened.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.040
We may experience pressure.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:57.199
We may be the subject of some wrong, some injustice, some evil that threatens our peace.

00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:05.199
And then the question is, will we handle things in a way that is pleasing to Jehovah?

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:12.079
Or will we become impatient or try to take matters into our own hands?

00:07:12.079 --> 00:07:18.519
In the following dramatization, notice how a family draws strength from a Bible account

00:07:18.519 --> 00:07:23.959
that highlights love and respect for Jehovah's sovereignty.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:56.199
Thank you.

00:07:56.199 --> 00:07:58.199
Okay, Mom, I'm going to preach.

00:07:58.199 --> 00:07:59.199
See you.

00:07:59.199 --> 00:08:00.199
Bye, Mom.

00:08:00.199 --> 00:08:01.199
Love you.

00:08:01.199 --> 00:08:02.199
Have a good day.

00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:23.079
I know she's wide.

00:08:23.079 --> 00:08:24.079
Oh, yeah.

00:08:26.079 --> 00:08:28.079
Okay, I'm totally posting that.

00:08:28.079 --> 00:08:29.079
Do it.

00:08:29.079 --> 00:08:31.079
Okay, it's up.

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:41.980
Hey, everyone, Brooke here in Amanda.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.980
Guess who just walked in.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.309
There's Jake.

00:08:48.309 --> 00:08:50.309
Today's Paul, would she ever?

00:08:50.309 --> 00:08:52.309
No, she would never.

00:08:52.309 --> 00:08:54.309
She's an angel.

00:08:54.309 --> 00:08:57.820
Actually, you know she's wild.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.820
Oh, she saw it.

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:01.820
I don't believe you.

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.820
I don't even think she likes guys.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:08.820
What if she's into girls?

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:15.690
I bet she's still a virgin.

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:29.559
Hey, can I see that?

00:09:29.559 --> 00:09:33.000
Yeah, of course.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Here you go.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Enjoy life forever.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Now, how are you going to do that?

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Well, that's a very good question, actually.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Well, I've got promises.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000
No, no, no.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Oh, not God, you.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
What are you doing?

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Me?

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Well, I try to help others.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Try?

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Man, all you do is stand next to your little cart

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
while the rest of us stand up for your rights, bro.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Well, I'm actually neutral.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Neutral?

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Ain't no neutral.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
You're just a coward.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:16.169
Take a trash.

00:10:16.169 --> 00:10:18.169
How did it go?

00:10:18.169 --> 00:10:20.169
It was a tough day at the car park.

00:10:20.169 --> 00:10:21.169
I'm okay.

00:10:21.169 --> 00:10:43.299
Olivia?

00:10:43.299 --> 00:10:45.299
What's wrong?

00:10:45.299 --> 00:11:03.129
Would she ever?

00:11:03.129 --> 00:11:04.129
No, she would never.

00:11:04.129 --> 00:11:05.129
She's an angel.

00:11:05.129 --> 00:11:09.240
You know she's wild.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.240
Oh, she saw it.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:17.269
I'm so sorry that happened to you.

00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:33.529
You know, it reminds me of a situation Paul was in.

00:11:33.529 --> 00:11:43.620
I think it was Acts chapter 16,

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:48.460
in verse 23,

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:54.340
after they had inflicted many blows on them.

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:58.299
They threw them into prison

00:11:58.299 --> 00:12:03.409
and ordered the jailer to guard them securely.

00:12:03.409 --> 00:12:08.000
Because he got such an order,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
he threw them into the inner prison

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
and fastened their feet in the stocks.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.019
But about the middle of the night,

00:12:18.019 --> 00:12:20.019
Paul and Silas were praying

00:12:20.019 --> 00:12:23.019
and praising God with song.

00:12:23.019 --> 00:12:26.019
And the prisoners were listening to them.

00:12:26.019 --> 00:12:31.000
What do you think made them want to sing?

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.580
They loved Jehovah.

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.580
And when they focused on that,

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:39.580
how do you think they felt?

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:50.519
I think they felt some peace.

00:12:50.519 --> 00:12:52.519
That's right.

00:12:52.519 --> 00:12:55.519
How about we dig a little bit deeper?

00:12:55.519 --> 00:13:06.070
Well, what did you notice?

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:10.070
Gabe and Olivia are under pressure.

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:13.070
Olivia in the classroom?

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:16.070
Gabe at the witnessing cart?

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:19.070
How will they handle the pressure?

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:25.070
In a way that preserves their peace with Jehovah?

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:28.070
Well, it's a good question.

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:33.070
And really all of us need to reflect on that question

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:36.070
when we're under pressure.

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:39.070
We know that Jehovah's way is the best way.

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:45.860
We're convinced that his way of ruling is the best way.

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:48.860
But when we're subjected to pressure,

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:52.860
perhaps the victim of some injustice,

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.860
or even of some evil,

00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:02.340
we may be inclined to take matters into our own hands.

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:06.710
And when we do,

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:09.710
it can jeopardize our peace.

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:17.990
So how do we demonstrate respect for Jehovah's sovereignty?

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:22.990
The inspired advice in Romans chapter 12 can help.

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:27.990
Let's look together at Romans chapter 12 beginning in verse 17.

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:35.289
Return evil for evil to no one.

00:14:35.289 --> 00:14:40.289
So this provides the context for what follows.

00:14:40.289 --> 00:14:43.289
We may suffer some evil.

00:14:43.289 --> 00:14:46.289
Return evil for evil to no one.

00:14:46.289 --> 00:14:51.289
Take into consideration what is fine from the viewpoint of all men.

00:14:51.289 --> 00:14:53.289
And then notice verse 18.

00:14:53.289 --> 00:14:59.289
If possible, as far as it depends on you,

00:14:59.289 --> 00:15:04.289
be peaceable, be a peacemaker with all men.

00:15:04.289 --> 00:15:10.919
Now these words really heighten our appreciation

00:15:10.919 --> 00:15:14.919
for Jehovah's reasonableness.

00:15:14.919 --> 00:15:17.919
Why do we say that?

00:15:17.919 --> 00:15:23.919
Because Jehovah doesn't ask us to do something that we can't do.

00:15:23.919 --> 00:15:27.919
He doesn't ask us to control others.

00:15:27.919 --> 00:15:28.919
No.

00:15:28.919 --> 00:15:35.710
To the extent it depends on you.

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:40.710
Jehovah asks that each of us control ourselves,

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:45.710
our response to a situation.

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:48.710
And to be peacemakers.

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:51.710
And then an explanation.

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:53.710
Verse 19.

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:57.710
Do not avenge yourselves, beloved,

00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:59.710
but yield place to the wrath.

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:00.710
Why?

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:04.710
For it is written, vengeance is mine.

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:08.710
I will repay, says Jehovah.

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:13.710
So the advice is be a peacemaker.

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:16.710
And leave wrath to God.

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:25.250
Let him determine if and when and upon whom vengeance will be brought.

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:30.250
It's easy to say, but is it always easy to do?

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:33.250
No.

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:38.250
The example of King David can be very helpful to us.

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:41.250
Through no fault of his own,

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:48.250
David became the target of King Saul's murderous hatred.

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:53.250
And on several occasions Saul tried to kill David.

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:56.250
For several years David lived as a fugitive,

00:16:56.250 --> 00:17:04.250
but there were opportunities during that time for David to harm Saul,

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:06.250
even to kill him.

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:10.250
He could have justified that in his mind,

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:13.250
but do you think had he done so,

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:17.250
it would have threatened his peace,

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:20.250
his peace especially with Jehovah,

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:24.250
we know that it would.

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:27.250
So how did David respond?

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:30.250
On one occasion he said to his men,

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:34.250
it is unthinkable from Jehovah's standpoint

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:37.250
that I should do such a thing to my Lord,

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:39.250
the anointed of Jehovah.

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:44.039
What helped David?

00:17:44.039 --> 00:17:50.039
Well, he saw a bigger picture than David and Saul, didn't he?

00:17:50.039 --> 00:17:55.039
He saw a picture with David, Saul, and Jehovah,

00:17:55.039 --> 00:17:59.039
and he knew that if Saul needed to be corrected,

00:17:59.039 --> 00:18:03.039
Jehovah would do it in his time and way.

00:18:03.039 --> 00:18:06.039
As a result David was willing to be patient,

00:18:06.039 --> 00:18:10.039
and he preserved his peace, his peace with God,

00:18:10.039 --> 00:18:15.039
his inner peace, and his peace with those around him.

00:18:15.039 --> 00:18:18.039
What a beautiful example.

00:18:18.039 --> 00:18:23.039
And we can be sure that if we demonstrate our love for Jehovah

00:18:23.039 --> 00:18:28.039
by respecting his sovereignty, waiting on him,

00:18:28.039 --> 00:18:33.039
that we will enjoy peace as well.

00:18:33.039 --> 00:18:38.039
Jehovah assures us that he will bless his people.

00:18:38.039 --> 00:18:41.039
He will bless us with peace.

00:18:41.039 --> 00:18:44.039
So let us be determined to love Jehovah

00:18:44.039 --> 00:18:48.039
with our whole heart, soul, and mind,

00:18:48.039 --> 00:18:51.039
and to demonstrate our love for Jehovah

00:18:51.039 --> 00:18:56.039
by patiently waiting on him and respecting his sovereignty,

00:18:56.039 --> 00:18:58.039
his way of doing things.

00:18:58.039 --> 00:19:04.039
If we do, we will enjoy the incomparable peace of God.

00:19:04.039 --> 00:19:08.039
Now, Brother Ralph Walholz, a helper to the Personnel Committee,

00:19:08.039 --> 00:19:12.039
will present the next talk of this symposium.

00:19:12.039 --> 00:19:17.039
How love leads to genuine peace, love of neighbor.
