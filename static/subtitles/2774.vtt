00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.089
This story is about brother Atah Yaldiqal.

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:10.689
He is an Assyrian man from Iraq and was raised as a Christian.

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:15.890
Atah's childhood friend had noticed that Atah had a thirst for the truth.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.890
But because of the political situation in Iraq,

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.289
the two friends got separated and moved to different countries in Europe.

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.289
But was the geographical distance a problem?

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.489
No. This is their story.

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:43.439
I was about 18 years old when one of my friends named Ziyad asked me,

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:48.780
Atah, have you read the Bible?

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.780
We started to read the Bible from Genesis.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.579
I remember one time when we read the sermon on the Mount.

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.579
We decided to go up to the mountain to read.

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:07.769
Our hometown, Aglotch, has many mountains.

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:12.569
In June 1998, I was in an accident.

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:17.340
In this accident, I lost both my legs.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.340
It was a difficult time because I was so young.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.140
I was 22 years old, so it was very hard.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.540
I remember I was the time in Holland.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:36.540
And I hear the news from the family from Iraq.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:47.010
And I went somewhere alone, and I started to cry.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.810
I came to Sweden, and like many refugees,

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.459
I had no desire to leave Iraq.

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:59.060
I was talking to Ziyad all the time.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.859
And one day in 2006, he called me and told me

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:10.580
that he was studying with Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.180
So I said to him,

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.580
is it logical that two billion Christians are wrong

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.580
and that you are right?

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.780
And after a few months, I told him also that I'm going to be baptized.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.580
When he said that,

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.979
I thought I was going to get a heart attack.

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:33.780
And he tried to convince me that

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.379
it is not that true, that it is maybe a big mistake

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.379
what I'm going to make my life.

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.379
I remember it was in 2006.

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.780
A brother, his name was Ziyad.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.180
He talked to me about Atta.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.580
So I talked to brother Majid.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.379
Ziyad had left the number with him,

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:56.979
and we agreed to meet in my apartment.

00:02:56.979 --> 00:03:00.379
I decided I would give the witnesses a chance.

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.780
I started to study for a few months,

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.180
and after that he told me that he don't want to have a study.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.180
I had a lot of things to deal with.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.580
It was not the right time.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.379
I was too tired to listen.

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:15.379
So I told him,

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:16.780
leave me for now,

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.780
because I cannot be bothered with anything.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.180
So what we did, that we just stopped the study,

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.979
but I still continue to phone him,

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:26.780
to visit him from time to time,

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.379
to invite him to,

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:30.979
like the memorial or the convention.

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:33.979
And that's what we did for several years.

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:37.379
He was very patient with me.

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:38.780
And let it be up to me,

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.979
when and how we should study.

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:47.039
But he kept in contact with me to check how I'm doing.

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:52.639
For me, I knew very early that Atta will be a brother a day.

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:55.240
He was so honest.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.439
He loved Jehovah.

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:59.240
He loved Jesus Christ,

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.639
and he loved the truth.

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:08.639
He was of great help to me.

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:11.240
When my mother died,

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.639
he and his wife really helped me

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:16.439
in a way that changed my life.

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:18.040
He invited me home to him,

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.439
and he asked me,

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:22.240
can you just explain that for me?

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.439
Why should I get baptized?

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:28.439
I told Majid and Ziyad,

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:30.839
that I have come to the conclusion,

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:33.839
yes, I must be baptized.

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:36.240
It is important.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.839
What convinced me was the way Jehovah and his organization

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:41.839
treats people.

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:45.839
Jehovah is not obligated to provide us with a hope for the future,

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:49.439
but he does so out of love.

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:53.240
He shows us more respect than we show ourselves.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.040
And the way the organization is united

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.040
cannot come from men.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.240
So when I was home,

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.839
we called Jehovah to Skype,

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:06.439
and he told me I can't find any reason

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:11.199
anymore not to be baptized.

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:13.199
At the regional convention,

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:18.449
August 9, 2014,

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:21.649
it was a beautiful day.

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:27.120
It was one of the biggest days in my life,

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.319
so it was just a very warm feeling to be just

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:34.319
beside one of your best friends.

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:36.519
And remember that one day,

00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:39.519
years ago, we were trying to understand the Bible

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:42.120
without having any chance to understand it.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.170
And now we are sitting there, Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:48.569
I often think,

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:50.769
God, is it true?

00:05:50.769 --> 00:05:52.170
Is it real?

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:56.370
Do I really deserve to have all these blessings?

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:57.970
I don't have anything.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:59.370
No challenge.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.970
Do not understand everything yet.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.170
But still,

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:04.769
thanks to God.

00:06:04.769 --> 00:06:10.759
I can understand the Bible.

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:12.759
I think we don't need to be afraid

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:15.360
that some people will never heard about the truth

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.959
if they really want to know that.

00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:20.160
Jehovah will take care of it.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.360
So Jehovah was actually

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:29.550
way too far out there for many, many, many years.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.750
For me,

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.350
when I think of the hope of the New World,

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:36.149
I'll be honest and say that

00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:38.949
it is not a question about having my legs back

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:41.350
and being able to jump like a gazelle.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:42.350
No,

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.550
that is not what I think about.

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.750
Because there are problems in this world

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.649
both for me and for others

00:06:48.649 --> 00:06:52.550
that make my legs not that important.

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:53.350
No,

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.050
let me have a good conscience.

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.050
Let there be justice by that.

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.050
I mean that

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:02.430
it is God who governs and no one else.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:03.730
True love,

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.529
that is what I long for.
