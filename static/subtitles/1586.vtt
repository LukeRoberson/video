00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:13.539
I knew this day would come.

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:19.480
True Christians expect opposition,

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.480
but it hurt to see if other vassals get arrested.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:39.710
After what happened,

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:57.299
I was scared to talk about Jehovah.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.420
Marcos has been looking for work for months.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.420
It's starting to feel hopeless.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:25.420
I appreciate that he supports me in the Pioneer Ministry.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:41.299
But shouldn't he focus on finding work?

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.299
I was so happy when I heard Nicole got invited to SKE.

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:52.420
But as I kept thinking about it,

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.420
I started to feel empty, disappointed.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.090
Other seemed to get so many privileges.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.090
Why not me?

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:15.280
In my Bible reading,

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.280
I found an example of courage to preach boldly, despite opposition.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.289
After I told Marcos how I was feeling,

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:30.289
we considered a Bible character who endured with hope.

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:35.610
Jesus said,

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.610
Among those born of women,

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.610
there has not been raised up anyone greater than John the Baptist.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:55.550
Many that listen to him were moved to repent and get baptized.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:06.430
Preparing their hearts to receive the Messiah,

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.430
he even baptized the Son of God.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:20.300
But as Jesus' ministry increased,

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.300
John's began to decrease.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.710
When his disciples pointed that out to John,

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:32.710
he humbly rejoiced at what Jehovah was accomplishing through Jesus.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:38.849
However, John faced adversity,

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:40.849
just like worshipers of Jehovah today.

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:53.490
John was imprisoned for boldly declaring the truth.

00:03:53.490 --> 00:04:12.370
Nothing prevented him from preaching courageously.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.370
As time passed, and he remained in prison,

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:44.540
John needed reassurance, just like I do.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:51.100
His disciples returned with a message from Jesus.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.100
Observe what Jehovah is accomplishing around you.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:57.139
Now I see what Jehovah is accomplishing around me.

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:09.339
I can imitate John the Baptist and endure with hope.

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:12.339
I have so many reasons to be joyful.

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:17.339
Among them, seeing Jehovah use others to accomplish as well.

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:37.300
People need to learn about Jehovah.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:42.470
Like John, I can have courage.

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:44.470
No matter what adversity I may face.
