00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:09.390
What many notice when they first attend meetings of Jehovah's Witnesses is that they hear God's name Jehovah.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:20.390
In this life story, Sotan Yuan relates the impact that learning God's name had on her after surviving the killing fields of Cambodia.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:43.600
On the killing fields in Cambodia, I prayed to God, but I didn't know His name.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.600
When I was a very young girl, they subredd of family.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.600
And they put me to work in a rice field from five in the morning till nine in the evening.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:03.600
When you see some other children that get killed, you really desperately cry for help inside.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.599
You always think that you were next.

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:14.599
But in my heart, I always believe that it has to be a true God somewhere somehow that can help me get through this.

00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:21.780
One year later, my family decided to escape Cambodia.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.780
We walk close to six, seven months to Thailand.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:35.379
And I have 20 brothers and sisters, only four of us are wife.

00:01:35.379 --> 00:01:44.469
I have a blind on that hold on my shoulder all the time.

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:47.469
But one day, we got caught.

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:59.349
As they start shooting, I push my on down to the ground and try to pretend that we are dead.

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:03.349
And when I get up, I have no idea where my parent was.

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:09.020
We spent many months in a jungle.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.020
As I try to survive, I eat whatever I can find.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.020
And I also help my aunt eat to survive.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:24.020
One day, when I go out to look for food, I walk so far away, I couldn't find my way back.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:35.020
I start crying really hard underneath the tree and look up to the sky and pray to the true God.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.020
I was raised as a child to pray to Buddha.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:47.020
But on this night, when I start praying, I specifically said that I am not praying to Buddha.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.360
I am praying to the true God.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:59.360
And I say, true God, if you are really here, please help me.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.360
Because I am really scared and I am hungry and I am cold.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.740
After I pray, I just fall to sleep under the big tree.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:16.180
Eventually, I make it into the refugee camp in Thailand.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.180
And I was reunited with my family.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:27.180
We live in the refugee camp in Thailand for about ten years before we come to the United States.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.180
My searching for the true God, it didn't stop there.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.180
We tried to go to different churches, but we didn't understand anything.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.180
One day, when I come home from school, I met this gentleman named Harold.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.180
And he asked if he can talk to me about God.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.180
I agree, because I saw he had a Bible, he must be a good man.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.180
When he talked to me, I tried to pay attention, so hard.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.180
But I still didn't understand what he was saying.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.180
And he went very slow.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.180
And then he said, your name, I say my name so 10.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.180
And then he said, your name so 10, my name's Harold.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.180
God's name, Jehovah.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.180
I never thought God had name.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.180
And I was sent that day on.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.180
I never forget Jehovah's name.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.180
It's super glue in my heart.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.180
He gave me his phone number.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.180
He said, how can I ask his wife to stop by someday?

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.180
But then I moved away from where I live.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.180
Even though I didn't do the truth at that time,

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.180
I always pray to Jehovah.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.180
After I learned God's name, I went back to the church.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.180
The priest would start out with Heavenly Father,

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.180
but live out Jehovah's name.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.180
So I raised my hand.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.180
I asked him, sir, when you pray Heavenly Father,

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.180
why don't you say Heavenly Father Jehovah?

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.180
Why are you not using God's name?

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.180
It's just something I do.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.180
And then he told me that God does not force me to be here.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.180
So I welcome to leave or stay if I want.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.180
So because I realized that they don't use Jehovah's name,

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.180
I left and never returned.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:31.160
And after many years, I tried to call Harold.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.160
But no one picked up the phone, so I leave a message.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.160
I was hoping that they'd remember me.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.410
Two weeks later, Harold came to my door.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:52.660
But at the time, I was working at night and sleep during the day.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.660
But Harold never gave up. He came back.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.910
And I keep on praying to Jehovah,

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.910
asking for someone to knock on my door.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.910
And finally, one day, I opened the door.

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.910
And when I saw him, I almost couldn't talk.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.910
I was tear up. I was so happy to see him.

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:19.910
Because this is the man who introduced me to Jehovah's name.

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.910
Eventually, I started studying with sister.

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.910
And she helped me grow spiritually.

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.910
To know that you have a Heavenly Father,

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.910
that care about you.

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.910
That was the best feeling on earth.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:39.910
It makes me want to know more about him, want to learn more about him.

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.910
I would ask questions, did he like this? Did he like that?

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:47.910
And then, when I go to the camp tomorrow,

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:51.910
I hear Jehovah's name so many times.

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:57.480
I feel that said, I found my place.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.480
I got baptized in 2013.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:06.480
My blind aunt, that I helped her survive through the jungle.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.480
She's still living until today.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:13.480
And now that I can get a chance to talk to her about Jehovah,

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.480
that was surprising.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:20.480
And I can't stress enough how wonderful

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:26.480
and make privilege that I receive from Jehovah just to know who he is.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:31.480
And to learn that there is true God.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.480
He have a name.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.480
And his name is Jehovah.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:48.660
Sister UN still carries painful memories

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:53.660
from what she and her family suffered because of man's ruthless wars.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.660
But she now has hope for the future

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:59.660
and the comfort of knowing her Heavenly Father, Jehovah,

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:02.660
something we all share with her.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.660
Sister UN has the added joy of worshipping the true God

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.660
together with her husband and young daughter.
