00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.259
Lily married life came with a lot of unexpected challenges.

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:15.169
You dream about the way your marriage will go, but then the reality is quite different.

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:20.530
All we ever did was argue, or we wouldn't speak to one another.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.570
We never ever went to the elders.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.129
We just didn't want to bother them.

00:00:24.129 --> 00:00:30.440
We just felt, you know, we needed to figure it out ourselves.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:40.649
We decided if the household that we would separate.

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.729
The separation wasn't a good thing, because in some respects it made things worse.

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:48.409
It did have an impact on the boys.

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:49.969
They started acting out.

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:56.299
They got into some trouble with the police one time.

00:00:56.299 --> 00:01:01.820
And there was a loneliness because you've gotten married, and now you don't have that,

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.460
and you're by yourself.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.260
And the same old routine went on, where you're cooking and cleaning and doing laundry and

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.379
working.

00:01:10.379 --> 00:01:12.859
I felt sick to my stomach.

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:17.180
I had a hard time getting up every morning and facing the world.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.299
At that point I felt that I needed to have the elders help out a little bit.

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:29.299
I did pray for Jehovah's help to direct me, and kept wondering why Jehovah wasn't really

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:30.780
answering my prayers.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.180
But I kind of realized now that it was because we were separated.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.140
The expectations of the separation were not at all what I was thinking.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.459
I reflected on the marriage vows.

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:49.060
One of the things I thought about was a sister in our congregation.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.659
She was married to an unbeliever, and then she learned the truth.

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.900
And he was so violent.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.140
He would beat her.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.819
He would burn her books.

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:59.420
He would burn her clothes.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.459
He did not allow her children to attend the meetings.

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:06.260
And I thought about the problems that Darryl and I had, and I thought, well, Darryl is

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.260
a kind person.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.020
He's never done that.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.460
And I thought, you know, this is something that we need to really work on.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:19.460
We need to really put forth the effort to start applying Bible principles to put Jehovah

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:26.340
first in our life, so that we can bring our marriage back into union with Jehovah.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:35.949
I realized that it wasn't what I wanted, it was what Jehovah wanted.

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:36.949
There was just no other choice.

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:42.870
The Jehovah wasn't going to bless us unless we got back together.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.069
When we got back together, our marriage was still a work in progress.

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.629
You can't have a perfect marriage in this world, but you can sure make it better when

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.150
you put Jehovah first.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.389
We enjoyed feelings towards each other.

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:59.590
I felt closer to Debi.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.990
Debi and I have been married now 48 years.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.550
Separation does not make anything better at all.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.349
If you even have an inkling of love for one another, you want to work on that and you

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:15.590
want to make it bloom so that Jehovah can bless it.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.590
The blessings have been endless.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.789
Our children are all doing fantastic in the truth.

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:25.710
Jehovah said taste and see that it is good, so we've got to do that.
