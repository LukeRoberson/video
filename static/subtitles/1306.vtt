00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:14.720
When you and I receive a new Bible-based publication,

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.519
we're benefiting from the painstaking work of those who prepared it.

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.120
The faith in the screech slave carefully considers

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.719
what spiritual food we need now to strengthen our faith.

00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:30.920
But how does that spiritual food actually get into our hands?

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.119
The publishing committee of the governing body

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:37.119
supervises the printing and shipping of Bible literature

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.219
and thousands of our dear brothers and sisters

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.020
then assist them to deliver it to us.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.219
The publishing committee arranges for the most efficient use of funds

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.619
that have been donated to advance the worldwide kingdom work.

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:56.520
They take into account the needs of our brothers in specific lands

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.820
and consider how best to help them

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.420
reach interested ones in their territory.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.019
In Sub-Saharan Africa, for example,

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.519
the South Africa branch serves the spiritual needs of people

00:01:08.519 --> 00:01:13.519
across 20 countries in more than 220 languages.

00:01:13.519 --> 00:01:17.120
In this report, notice what is being done

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.120
to supply needed literature to this vast field

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.719
and the beneficial effect this is having on people.

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:28.519
This work is an expression of Jehovah's deep love for his witnesses

00:01:28.519 --> 00:01:40.659
and for those to whom we preach the good news.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.560
The new shipping warehouse at the South Africa branch

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.260
sends literature to 16,400 congregations every month.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.060
At this huge warehouse, bigger than two football fields

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.459
literature requests are processed, packed and ready to go

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:00.719
with the next shipment to that region.

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:06.219
Kokuma congregation in northern Kenya is located in a refugee camp.

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:09.319
People originate from eight different countries.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:12.819
The brothers preaching here appreciate the variety of languages

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.319
they can request literature in.

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.819
As we preach to the refugees,

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.620
it makes me happy to see how they respond to the message

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.250
because I see their sadness turned into hope.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.250
Work a thousand kilometers from Sudan to Kenya.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.750
I will take me like four months, I can say 2015.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:45.750
And this is where I start the book called What Really By Voltage.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.550
When I read those things, they touch and I fell

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.750
that when you are passed and you get water, cool water.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.150
If that can't be known to them.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.750
If thought to them become stable again, I might return.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.449
Since I am now one of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:07.550
I have to go see how my mother is and preach to her.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.550
If I see my father again in the resurrection,

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.550
I will tell him, Father, God's Word has come true.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.050
I will teach my father the knowledge that I got in Kokuma refugee camp.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.550
I was born in a refugee camp

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.050
and I cannot remember my parents.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.150
Later, I was raised in an orphanage.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.150
The publications we receive at the meetings

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.990
are one of the many provisions that help us to grow spiritually.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:58.490
Such deeds show that God wants people to live a life of purpose now

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:07.979
and to look forward to living forever in the future without suffering.

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:09.979
In the bulk storage area,

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:15.819
the location code system identifies where items are stored.

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.319
High-reach forklifts are used to safely place pellets of literature

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:24.319
in the shelving system that is three stories high.

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:29.819
Coming over this shelf are large quantities of Bible Teachbooks in Portuguese,

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:32.819
their destination, Angola.

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:39.819
There, on average, each publisher conducts more than four Bible studies.

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:42.819
I am conducting 30 Bible studies.

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:46.819
The majority attend the congregation meetings.

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:52.819
I sometimes have to hold back the tears when I see people making changes in their lives

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:55.819
because of the power of God's Word.

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:57.819
This gives me joy.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.290
With my husband, we conduct 36 Bible studies.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.290
I was also involved in war.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.290
Then I began studying the Bible.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.290
And now I have inner peace.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:25.819
I like the way to overwhelm people to have that same peace too.

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:41.839
Each month, over 11 million magazines and workbooks roll in from the printing presses.

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:46.839
These are quickly sorted in the picking line and sent to each congregation

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:49.839
in time for scheduled meetings and preaching initiatives.

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:55.839
One of the largest shipments of the public edition of the magazines goes to Zambia.

00:05:55.839 --> 00:06:00.839
This country has a publisher to population ratio of 1 to 85,

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:02.839
the lowest ratio on the continent.

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:05.839
Despite having so many publishers in the ministry,

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:09.839
there is still a high demand for the public edition of the magazines.

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:16.839
The Metropolitan Witnessing work here in Lusaka is really, really positive.

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:20.839
It's not unusual to find a Zambia coming up to you and asking you

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:24.839
if you've got the latest magazine.

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:28.839
These publications are not just for your people.

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:32.839
The message in them is beneficial to all Christians.

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:39.839
The world would have less confusion if people read these publications.

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:42.839
It is not me alone who reads.

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:45.839
There are many people who reads these magazines.

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:48.839
Please continue and thank you.

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:56.839
I feel good because these publications help me to learn about God.

00:06:56.839 --> 00:07:00.839
I also help others. I use them to teach my children.

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:09.939
Over 60,000 boxes of literature leave the warehouse every month.

00:07:09.939 --> 00:07:12.939
Some boxes are customized in order to help the brothers

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:16.939
who do the final delivery of the literature in challenging conditions.

00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:21.939
For instance, extra waterproofing for high rainfall areas.

00:07:21.939 --> 00:07:26.939
A handle is added if they're to be carried by hand over long distances.

00:07:26.939 --> 00:07:31.939
The literature for each depot is stacked together on pallets and wrapped securely.

00:07:31.939 --> 00:07:35.939
One of the largest languages shipped from the warehouse is Chichua,

00:07:35.939 --> 00:07:37.939
the main language of Malawi.

00:07:37.939 --> 00:07:42.939
The brothers in Malawi greatly appreciate receiving publications for their meetings.

00:07:42.939 --> 00:07:46.939
There was a time when it was difficult to get literature into the country.

00:07:46.939 --> 00:07:49.939
Our work was banned for many years.

00:07:49.939 --> 00:07:53.939
We received hardly any supplies of literature.

00:07:53.939 --> 00:07:55.939
We are not telling.

00:07:55.939 --> 00:08:00.939
Nowadays, there are no limitations as to worshipping our God.

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:03.939
We are able to attend meetings freely.

00:08:03.939 --> 00:08:05.939
Preach freely.

00:08:05.939 --> 00:08:10.939
We receive literature in abundance without any limitations.

00:08:10.939 --> 00:08:16.939
And so, every box of literature shipped from the warehouse connects to a story.

00:08:16.939 --> 00:08:22.939
A story of hope, love and care from our creator and his organization.
