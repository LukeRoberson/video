00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:10.849
The theme for this program is, be childlike, but not childish.

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:17.449
First Corinthians chapter 14, verse 20, is our theme scripture.

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:25.809
Brothers, do not become young children in your understanding, but be young children as

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:32.369
to badness and become full grown in your understanding.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.890
In this single verse, we're told not to be like a young child in one way, and we're told

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.009
to be like a young child in another way.

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:49.649
We should not be like a child when it comes to understanding, and we should be like a

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.770
child when it comes to badness.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:01.530
In this discussion, let's focus on three ways we should not be like a child, and then

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.450
let's talk about three ways we should be like a child.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:15.930
Please turn to Hebrews chapter 5, verses 13 and 14, and let's identify negative trait number

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.290
one that we do not want to imitate.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:28.689
For everyone who continues to feed on milk is unacquainted with the word of righteousness,

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:37.090
for he is a young child, but solid food belongs to mature people, to those who through

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:44.810
use have their powers of discernment trained to distinguish both right and wrong.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:53.010
So the negative trait that children have is immature feeding habits.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.329
Think about it.

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:02.930
Young children have a tendency to eat what they like regardless of its nutritional value.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:10.129
Most young ones would be perfectly happy eating ice cream candy, cookies, and other sweets

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.250
for all of their meals.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:22.090
But now we ask, what do our spiritual appetites and feeding habits reveal about us?

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.490
Consider how do we spend our free time?

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:32.770
Do we squander voluminous hours watching television or reading material that provides

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.250
little or no spiritual nutrition?

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:44.409
Or do we make wise use of our free time to take in solid spiritual food?

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:50.090
When we receive a new issue of the watchtower, do we merely scan through it, looking at

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.569
a few highlights, and then do something else?

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:01.930
Do we take time to research deeper spiritual truths so as to fully understand them?

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.569
Do we take time to really meditate?

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.490
Meditation is not daydreaming.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.050
Meditation is bridal, focused, thought.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:19.849
Pause your reading to ask questions such as, what does this teach me about Jehovah?

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.250
With whom can I share this information?

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.449
What's Jehovah telling me?

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:31.250
How does this fit in with other things I know about this subject?

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.289
How can I make application?

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:41.810
James 125 encourages us to peer into God's Word.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:48.370
According to the reference Bible, peer literally means to stoop beside.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.729
To illustrate, simply reading through the Bible could be likened to walking quickly through

00:03:54.729 --> 00:04:02.330
the world's greatest museum and periodically glancing at the various displays.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.650
You'll learn something.

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:11.650
But meditatively peering into God's Word can be likened to stopping all along the museum

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:20.209
route, and even stooping down, and closely examining from different angles, the artifacts,

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.610
exhibitions, and displays.

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:32.129
Now our knowledge and appreciation are going to be enhanced much more.

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:39.689
Yes, our spiritual appetite and feeding habits reveal much about whether we have done

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:47.089
away with the trait of a young child, namely, immature feeding habits.

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:52.730
Now please turn to Ephesians chapter 4, verse 14.

00:04:52.730 --> 00:05:01.129
Let's discern from this scripture negative trait number 2 that we all want to imitate.

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:09.250
So we should no longer be children, tossed about as by waves, and carried here and there

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:17.129
by every wind of teaching, by means of the trickery of men, by means of cunning and

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:20.129
deceptive schemes.

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:22.850
So what's the negative trait?

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:28.089
Young children are easily tricked or fooled.

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:34.569
This scripture likens being easily tricked about what's right or wrong to being tossed

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:40.449
about by the waves of the ocean and blown around by the wind.

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:46.089
If you think of a piece of wood floating in a turbulent ocean or a piece of paper in

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:51.490
a windstorm, there's no stability or direction.

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:57.089
Both can be easily maneuvered to go anywhere.

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:58.649
Like any position.

00:05:58.649 --> 00:06:07.850
Well, that's true of very young children who often can be easily deceived, for example.

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:16.529
If given a choice between a shiny coin of little value and paper money of great value,

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:19.810
the shiny coin will likely be chosen.

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.649
But now here's the point.

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:27.050
What do our spiritual choices reveal about us?

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:34.730
Do our choices in regard to music and other entertainment, clothing, and grooming indicate

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:39.769
that we're being fooled even slightly by Satan and his world?

00:06:39.769 --> 00:06:43.810
Yes, Satan has bent on tricking us.

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:52.009
But Jehovah tells us, in 1 Corinthians 14, 20, the scripture we read earlier, do not become

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:58.149
young children in your understanding.

00:06:58.149 --> 00:07:03.829
But now please turn to Matthew chapter 11, 16 and 17.

00:07:03.829 --> 00:07:12.110
Here we'll find the third negative trait of a child that we do not want to imitate.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:16.310
With whom will I compare this generation?

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:24.189
It is like young children sitting in the marketplaces who call out to their playmates, saying,

00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:28.509
we played the flute for you, but you did not dance.

00:07:28.509 --> 00:07:34.269
We wailed, but you did not beat yourselves in grief.

00:07:34.269 --> 00:07:41.550
Jesus was saying that adult people were acting like children.

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:44.029
Children love to play.

00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:52.029
So the negative trait of young children is that they prefer play over responsibility.

00:07:52.029 --> 00:07:53.269
Think about it.

00:07:53.269 --> 00:08:00.310
The vast majority of the waking hours of a small child are spent playing.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:04.550
Play, play, and more play.

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:07.470
Most of their life is fun in games.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:13.910
But later, when the child goes to school, what does he get the time to do so?

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:18.149
He has to take it from his playtime.

00:08:18.149 --> 00:08:26.029
But now, spiritually speaking, we can ask ourselves, how far have we progressed in buying

00:08:26.029 --> 00:08:30.389
out time from our playtime?

00:08:30.389 --> 00:08:36.669
Ephesians 5.16 encourages us to make the best use of our time.

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:44.549
Literally, according to the footnote, this scripture is telling us to buy out the appointed

00:08:44.549 --> 00:08:46.190
time.

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:50.230
That is, buy it from less important things.

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:56.029
So the question for all of us is, have we bought out the majority of our playtime for

00:08:56.029 --> 00:09:00.980
more important spiritual responsibilities?

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:08.100
Now we've discussed three negative traits of a young child that we want to avoid.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:14.500
If we had time, we could have discussed other negative traits to be avoided, such as,

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:18.779
children tend to have a short attention span.

00:09:18.779 --> 00:09:21.019
They're easily distracted.

00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:25.620
Their curiosity often gets them into trouble.

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:30.139
And they generally need a lot of time and attention.

00:09:30.139 --> 00:09:33.100
They're high maintenance.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:39.059
But now, let's briefly discuss three positive traits of a young child that we do well

00:09:39.059 --> 00:09:41.860
to imitate.

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:50.820
The characteristic number one is in 1 Corinthians 1420, which we read at the outset.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:59.419
That scripture tells us to, quote, be young children as to badness.

00:09:59.419 --> 00:10:03.700
So what's the characteristic that we want to imitate?

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:11.340
Young children are innocent, inexperienced, when it comes to badness.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:17.820
Or put another way, they haven't done many truly bad things.

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:25.259
Like children, we don't want to gain knowledge or experience in what is bad.

00:10:25.259 --> 00:10:32.899
For example, when it comes to pornography, we want no experience whatsoever in regard

00:10:32.899 --> 00:10:37.460
to this filthy thing of Satan's world.

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:44.899
When it comes to television programs that are designated for a mature audience, remember

00:10:44.899 --> 00:10:48.980
to tell yourself, I'm not old enough.

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:52.460
I'm a young child.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:11:03.100
For positive characteristic number two, let's consider Matthew chapter 18, verses 2-4.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:12.740
So calling a young child to him, he, Jesus, stood him in their midst and said, truly I say

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:20.820
to you, unless you turn around and become as young children, you will buy no means enter

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.539
into the kingdom of the heavens.

00:11:23.539 --> 00:11:30.500
Therefore, whoever will humble himself like this young child is the one who is the greatest

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:34.019
in the kingdom of the heavens.

00:11:34.019 --> 00:11:36.820
What's the desirable trait?

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:40.179
Young children are humble and teachable.

00:11:40.179 --> 00:11:45.100
Young children ask many questions, because they want to learn.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:51.139
But grownups are often hesitant to ask questions, why?

00:11:51.139 --> 00:11:54.820
They don't want to look uninformed.

00:11:54.820 --> 00:12:02.019
But acting like we know something when we don't, is actually dishonest, and probably

00:12:02.019 --> 00:12:04.700
motivated by pride.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:11.500
The point is, don't be afraid to reveal what you don't know.

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:16.730
Remain humble and teachable like a child.

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:26.850
Now, let's identify desirable trait number three by going to Matthew 21, 15, and 16.

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:33.690
When the chief priest and the scribe saw the marvelous things he did, and the boys who

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:38.610
were shouting in the temple, save we pray the Son of David.

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:45.409
They became indignant and said to him, do you hear what these are saying?

00:12:45.409 --> 00:12:53.169
Jesus said to them, yes, did you never read this out of the mouth of children and infants,

00:12:53.169 --> 00:12:56.370
you have brought forth praise?

00:12:56.370 --> 00:13:01.210
So what desirable characteristic can we identify?

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:06.889
Young children are exuberant and enthusiastic.

00:13:06.889 --> 00:13:15.769
But in like manner, we want to remain exuberant and expressive about Jehovah, Jesus, the

00:13:15.769 --> 00:13:19.769
kingdom, and other spiritual things.

00:13:19.769 --> 00:13:27.850
Some 145.7 encourages us to bubble over and shout joyfully because of these wonderful

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:35.169
things, and we never want to lose that childlike enthusiasm.

00:13:35.169 --> 00:13:42.210
So there we have three desirable traits of a young child that we want to do our utmost

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:44.289
to imitate.

00:13:44.289 --> 00:13:51.929
If we had time, we could discuss several other positive characteristics such as children

00:13:51.929 --> 00:14:01.049
tend to be trusting, not prejudiced, and not hypocritical.

00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:09.169
But now in review, may each of us prayerfully strive not to be childish when it comes to

00:14:09.169 --> 00:14:14.129
number one, immature feeding habits.

00:14:14.129 --> 00:14:25.610
Number two, being easily tricked or fooled, and number three, preferring play over responsibility.

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:33.450
On the other hand, may each of us prayerfully strive to be childlike when it comes to being

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:39.610
number one, innocent, and inexperienced concerning badness.

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:50.450
Number two, humble and teachable, and number three, exuberant and enthusiastic about spiritual
