00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.410
Music expresses things that you can't express them on the other way.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:38.509
It is so powerful.

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:42.939
It's just an amazing gift.

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:46.380
Before I got the truth, I lived for music.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.380
I played hard and heavy rock and roll in bars and clubs

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.420
around the New York City area for many years.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.659
To me, I just found it to be a very depressing atmosphere.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.780
But then I developed a love for classical music

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.619
and I would practice six hours a day.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.620
I applied to the Juilliard School for the performing arts.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.859
I was accepted, but I did not attend.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.060
But deep inside, something was missing.

00:01:16.019 --> 00:01:19.700
My life changed drastically on February 16th, 1973

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.819
because that's when I learned the truth in a taxi cab.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.069
I came to Bethel on February 16th, 1979.

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:41.390
When I first came to Bethel, I had to put music aside for a little bit.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.189
I started working in the press room and that was a completely different environment for me.

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.510
I also worked with landscaping.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.750
I worked in construction over at Walkill.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.629
And I also worked with drafting and engineering.

00:01:53.629 --> 00:01:55.310
These were things I was not good at,

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.870
but I really felt I learned so much from doing these things

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.230
that it really kind of groomed me.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.629
And I think when Jehovah looked at me,

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:06.510
he says, well, we got somebody, we have to work with here.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.740
Just as you tune your instrument so it can be played in tune,

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.740
Jehovah tunes you, he teaches us to keep things in their place

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.939
and put worship of him first because that's where it's proper.

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:23.379
When Jehovah became number one, everything else took its place.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.900
Back in 1981, I met my wife when I was playing music at a wedding.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.180
We fell in love with each other.

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:36.370
As our love for Jehovah goes through the years, our love for our mates grows.

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.689
Now, I didn't leave music completely because I still had a love for it.

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.409
I still practiced as much as I could within my Bethel schedule

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:47.650
and within my whole Theocratic schedule.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.889
I don't miss it being number one.

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:52.610
I just feel happier now that it's in its proper place.

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:56.610
In 1995, when I first came over to Patterson,

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.210
I was working with audio video.

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:04.449
Since 2016, I've been working with music and working as a music editor and as a music composer.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.129
Working with brothers on a piece of music,

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.289
it's real blessing and a privilege.

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:13.969
Jehovah is letting us take advantage of a tool that we all like to listen to,

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:16.449
but now using it in a way that praises him.

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:21.330
Our whole motive is not to earn money.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.810
Our whole motive in using music is to glorify our Heavenly Father Joe.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.250
And we get music from all different cultures.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.090
And it really unites Jehovah's people.

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:36.930
Music it has a very special power in being able to reach the heart.

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:41.729
Now there's time where we just sit around and we just jam and play.

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:44.689
And you're really talking and communicating with each other.

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:45.650
There's nothing like it.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.969
I'm happier now knowing that I've lived a clean life.

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:03.569
Do I have any regrets or regrets?

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.729
What I did when I was 22 years old was the best thing that ever happened to me,

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:11.889
because that's how I came to know Jehovah.

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:14.530
And that's how I was able to find a balance in my life.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.660
Our happiness doesn't depend on our job.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.699
Our happiness really depends upon our spirituality and our relationship with Jehovah.

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:33.120
That's what life is all about.

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:40.100
It's a wonderful life.
