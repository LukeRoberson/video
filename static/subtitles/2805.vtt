00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:15.339
When I look at this picture of Aristarchus holding on to Paul sticking closer into a challenging time

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:16.940
It makes me think about how

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.140
Brothers and Sisters really helped me out through a difficult situation

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:25.379
The whole area was flooded including the house in which I was living at that time

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:30.300
I was waiting through waters which at the deepest point came up to about chest height

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:34.619
The battery on my phone was completely flat which meant I couldn't contact anybody

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:44.310
I watched our highlighted ticacus as a trustworthy friend and my friends have been very trustworthy

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.310
and without them I wouldn't have been able to cope

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.310
My dad suddenly had a massive stroke

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:58.039
but then my brother, he left Java

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.039
and then just a few months later my dad died

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:10.219
When I was studying this article I could have immediately put names down

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:15.219
for people who helped me like Aristarchus and Ticacus

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:21.219
but then as it came down to Mark and the practical help that he was able to give

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:25.219
well I thought that's my whole congregation

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:31.219
In 2016 my wife Gary, she lost her battle with cancer

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:34.219
and yeah all of a sudden I was on mute

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:41.799
Gary is the best person I ever met

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:48.049
I learnt from her that when you let people in you let your home run too

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:57.269
I was waiting through the water and I was just thinking if I can just make it to the home

00:01:57.269 --> 00:02:00.269
of this Brothers and Sisters everything will be alright

00:02:00.269 --> 00:02:03.269
I'm showing off where I ran at their home as well coming inside

00:02:03.269 --> 00:02:07.269
an opportunity to get clean, get warm and enjoy a nice meal

00:02:07.269 --> 00:02:10.270
And just like Aristarchus was willing to make sacrifices

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.270
they offered me to stay in their home for as long as I needed to

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.270
It was clearly inconvenient for me to stay in their home

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.270
but that inconvenience that it was outweighed by their genuine desire to help

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.270
and look after me through a difficult time

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.270
As soon as I plugged in my phone and it got power

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.270
the phone rang and it was the brother that had been my Bible instructor as a youth

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.270
and he was just checking and making sure that I was alright

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.270
and that I got everything that I needed

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.270
But did it stop there in the time that followed

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.270
My friends continued to reach out to get in touch to make sure that I got everything that I needed

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.270
to even continue to evacuate around for me

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.270
It was just to make sure that I could move on from what I'd take in place

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.270
I got to close friend of mine

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.270
She invited me for hot chocolate

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.270
and then she just asking how I was getting on

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.270
I said I was really struggling to sleep

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.270
and she very kindly showed me her journal

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.270
I thought it was such a great idea and I found it really helped

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.270
I would always have five things

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.270
I could say thank you to Jehovah for

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.270
My husband League is an amazing listener

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.270
just listening to whatever I was feeling at that time

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.270
even if it was a bit wild

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.270
Do other brothers and sisters

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.270
they're also very patient with me

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.270
and I would repeat myself over and over again

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.270
They didn't mind, they were just happy to listen

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.270
I needed reassurance because I didn't feel I was coping

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.270
with my father

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.270
It was like I couldn't believe he passed away

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.270
until I'd seen the death certificate

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.270
and it was the same with my brother

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.270
It wouldn't be real until I heard the announcement

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.740
and I thought that's kind of sound very strange

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.740
but I shared that with my friend

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.740
and I should know that's fine, it's okay

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.740
and that was really reassuring

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.740
I didn't think I was going crazy

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.520
When you're faced with something like that

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.520
normal things become like epic endeavors

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.520
things that you might have looked forward to

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.520
suddenly take on a level of anxiety

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.519
some friends of mine they were like

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:17.519
okay, get into the meetings

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.519
that's not even a thing now

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:20.519
you can just come with us

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.519
then I'm going to the meeting with two people

00:04:23.519 --> 00:04:24.519
rather than going on my own

00:04:24.519 --> 00:04:26.519
that was super helpful

00:04:26.519 --> 00:04:28.519
two sisters took it upon themselves

00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:30.519
to iron my shirt

00:04:30.519 --> 00:04:32.519
I could iron my shirt

00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:35.519
but that was such a help

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:37.519
you know?

00:04:37.519 --> 00:04:39.519
I like to tell my friends just how much

00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:41.519
all their support has meant

00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:44.519
not only does it help you get through a difficult period

00:04:44.519 --> 00:04:47.519
but that love, that care

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:49.519
that loyalty of sticking with you

00:04:49.519 --> 00:04:52.519
it helps you keep stabilising your other service

00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:54.519
Naturally you can think well

00:04:54.519 --> 00:04:56.519
I don't really know what to say

00:04:56.519 --> 00:04:58.519
I don't think I can do anything

00:04:58.519 --> 00:05:00.519
to change this

00:05:00.519 --> 00:05:01.519
but it's not true

00:05:01.519 --> 00:05:03.519
just the smallest little thing

00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:05.519
it makes such a big difference

00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:07.519
and the things I'll never forget

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:09.519
The brothers and sisters

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:11.519
out of their thoughtfulness

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:13.519
and out of their own creativity

00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:14.519
they are able to provide

00:05:14.519 --> 00:05:16.519
just what you need

00:05:16.519 --> 00:05:17.519
just when you need it

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:19.519
it was the most difficult thing

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:21.519
that I have ever had to deal with

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:23.519
but it was also the most

00:05:23.519 --> 00:05:25.519
faith-strengthening thing I've ever been through as well
