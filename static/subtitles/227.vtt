00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:10.689
Psalm 962 encourages Jehovah's people to sing to Jehovah and to praise his name.

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:15.810
When new songs have been released, the governing body has received many letters of appreciation

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:21.730
from new brothers and sisters thanking Jehovah for his goodness.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.050
We are pleased and form you that five additional songs are now available.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.250
Songs 146 through 150.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.289
Two of the songs will be sung at the memorial of Christ's death on March 23rd, namely songs

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:38.490
147 and 149.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.570
Make sure to learn how to sing them well.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.329
There are four steps that can help you in doing so.

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.369
First, listen repeatedly to the music until you know it well.

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:54.810
Second, analyze the lyrics and try to memorize them.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:01.130
Third, sing the melody together with the lyrics until you have mastered each song.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:07.930
Fourth, rehearse the new songs a few times during your family worship or personal study session

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.250
until you're comfortable with them.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.209
As announced in a letter to the congregations in December, for the concluding songs for

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:22.469
the midweek meeting for the weeks of February 22nd to March 14th, 2016, the final song

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:28.790
each week will be either song 147 or song 149.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.430
These new songs will give us further reason to praise Jehovah, especially during the upcoming

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.349
memorial season.

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:39.750
We thank Jehovah for these spiritual gifts.
