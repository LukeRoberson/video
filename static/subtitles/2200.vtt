WEBVTT

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:38.399
And I took it in cooler now.

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:41.399
Yes, you're right.

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:51.119
We may have to go look for more firewood soon.

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:52.119
What's happening?

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:54.119
Is this son of God ready?

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:55.119
Are they?

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:57.119
Are they angels?

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:59.119
Do not be afraid.

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:04.120
For look, I am declaring to you good news of a great joy that all the people will have.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:11.120
For today, there was born to you in David City, a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.120
And this is a sign for you.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.120
You will find an infant wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a manger.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:23.120
Glory in the heights above to God, and on earth peace among men of good will.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:30.120
Glory in the heights above to God, and on earth peace among men of good will.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.459
Glory in the heights above to God.

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:56.060
Brothers, let us by all means go over to Bethlehem and see what's taken place.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.060
Soon it will be done.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.060
Let's gather the flock and go now.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:31.849
May you have peace.

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.849
My name is Messiper.

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:39.849
And I am that shepherd boy, 40 years older.

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:45.849
Yes, I was there when the angels announced the birth of the Messiah.

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.849
Later, I became one of Jesus' followers.

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.849
And I came to be an overseer in the Christian congregation in Jerusalem.

00:02:52.849 --> 00:03:02.539
You may think that after seeing with my own eyes a multitude of angels announcing the birth of Jesus,

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:06.539
my faith would be rock solid.

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:17.539
In reality, over the past 40 years, I have had to strengthen my faith constantly by reminding myself of the reasons why I believe.

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:21.539
How do I know that Jesus is the Messiah?

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:26.539
How do I know that Christians have the truth?

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:32.539
Jehovah does not want worship that is based on blind belief or credulity.

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:42.949
You too can benefit by asking yourself, how do I know that Jehovah's witnesses have the truth?

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:48.949
You see, over time, the anxieties of life can blur our spiritual vision.

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:56.949
As the years go by, we could lose our zeal and our worship could become perfunctory.

00:03:56.949 --> 00:04:02.490
That happened to me.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.490
Come with me, and I'll tell you more about it.

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:22.939
Seeing the infant Jesus was indeed a great honor.

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:29.939
But he was exactly that, an infant, a helpless human baby.

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:34.939
This newborn appeared to be no different from any other newborn.

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:39.939
As the weeks and months went by, I began to ask myself,

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:47.939
could this infant, as beautiful as he is, really be the promised Messiah?

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:49.939
It is difficult to explain.

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:57.939
But with the passing of time, I just stopped thinking about the miracle that I'd witnessed with my own eyes

00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:01.939
as a young shepherd that night the angels appeared.

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:09.139
Jesus grew up to be a healthy and well-behaved boy.

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:13.139
In many ways, he seemed to be like any other boy.

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:18.139
Here he is at about seven years of age, playing with his friends.

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:25.139
Can you tell which boy is Jesus? Surely you cannot.

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:31.139
Although seven years have passed since the angels announced his birth,

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:39.370
still, there is no clear evidence of the Messiah's arrival.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.370
The young child continued growing and getting stronger, being filled with wisdom.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.370
Clearly, God's favor was upon him.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:52.370
He learned to be a carpenter, working with his father Joseph.

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.370
Twelve years have passed.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.370
Indeed, a long time.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:08.370
Yet I failed to see God's Holy Spirit operating on Jesus in the same manner that it had operated on the prophets of old,

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.370
such as Moses and Elijah.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.370
So I started doubting again.

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:23.370
Until one day, after I had begged Jehovah for more faith,

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.370
he made me remember.

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:34.370
Yes, I remembered what the angels had said when they appeared right before my eyes twelve years earlier.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:43.370
And I remembered some of the inspired prophecies that were so accurately fulfilled by Jesus' birth.

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.370
I had no reason to doubt.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:51.370
There was plenty of evidence pointing to Jesus as the promised Messiah.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.620
All I had to do was wait.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:59.620
Yes, wait on Jehovah.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:05.620
Then, when I least expected it, something did happen.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.620
Come with me, and I'll tell you all about it.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:27.420
Keeloub, you were supposed to be here an hour ago.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.420
We were about to begin without you.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:32.420
Please forgive me, and I am thankful for your patience.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:35.420
I would hate to miss today's discussion.

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.420
That was the boy this morning.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:44.420
The boy, for a twelve-year-old, he indeed continues to surprise me with his knowledge.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.420
Oh, surprise is not the word.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:51.420
We're amazed by his understanding and his questions.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:56.420
Jesus, please sit here in the middle so we can hear you better.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.420
I am eager to learn from you.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:02.420
The duel was just reading to me from one of the prophecies regarding the Messiah.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.420
May I ask you about the coming of the Messiah?

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:10.420
Are you sure you want to consider such deep things from the Scriptures?

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:16.420
These prophecies are quite complex, and there's still much debate over their meaning.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.420
What questions in particular do you have about the Messiah?

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:23.420
First, what is God's purpose for the Messiah?

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.420
Oh, that's an easy one, my son.

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:28.420
I'm holding here a scroll of Isaiah.

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.420
Here it says,

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:34.419
To the increase of his rulership and to peace, there will be no end.

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:39.419
On the throne of David and on his kingdom in order to establish it firmly

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:44.419
and to sustain it through justice and righteousness from now on and forever.

00:08:44.419 --> 00:08:48.419
Yes, it is quite clear that the Messiah will rule over God's people.

00:08:48.419 --> 00:08:52.419
He will liberate us from Gentile oppression, re-establish the Davidic throne,

00:08:52.419 --> 00:08:54.419
and bring everlasting peace.

00:08:54.419 --> 00:08:56.419
May I see the scroll, please?

00:08:56.419 --> 00:09:01.259
This is a beautiful passage.

00:09:01.259 --> 00:09:05.259
I especially like this part, where it says,

00:09:05.259 --> 00:09:07.259
For a child has been born to us.

00:09:07.259 --> 00:09:09.259
A son has been given to us,

00:09:09.259 --> 00:09:12.259
and the rulership will rest on his shoulder.

00:09:12.259 --> 00:09:15.259
His name will be called Wonderful Counselor,

00:09:15.259 --> 00:09:18.259
Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.

00:09:18.259 --> 00:09:21.259
Yes, Eternal Father, Eternal Peace.

00:09:21.259 --> 00:09:24.259
But that leads me to another question.

00:09:24.259 --> 00:09:27.259
If the Messiah comes to liberate us and to rule over us forever,

00:09:28.259 --> 00:09:31.259
why is it that here, just a few lines earlier,

00:09:31.259 --> 00:09:35.259
Isaiah speaks of the Messiah as a stumbling rock to both houses of Israel,

00:09:35.259 --> 00:09:39.259
as a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

00:09:39.259 --> 00:09:45.259
And did Isaiah not prophesy also that the Messiah would be cut off from the land of the living,

00:09:45.259 --> 00:09:49.259
crushed to death, and counted among the transgressors?

00:09:49.259 --> 00:09:56.320
What does all of this mean?

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.320
Jesus was then only 12 years old.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.320
His parents were accustomed to go from year to year to Jerusalem

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.320
for the festival of the Passover.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:09.320
On this particular occasion, when the days of the festival were over,

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.320
and Joseph and Mary were returning home,

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.320
the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem,

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.320
but his parents did not notice it.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.320
They assumed that he was in the group that was traveling together

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:24.320
so they went a day's journey before they began to search for him

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.320
among the relatives and acquaintances.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:31.320
Not finding him, Joseph and Mary returned to Jerusalem

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.320
and made a diligent search for him.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:38.320
That is how, after three days, they found him here in the temple

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:43.320
in the midst of the teachers listening to them and asking them questions.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:47.320
But all those listening to him were in constant amazement

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.320
at his understanding and his answers.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.320
Jesus had a perfect mind.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.320
He was able to remember what he had been taught from infancy

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:00.320
about his Heavenly Father and the history of his people.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:04.320
At this young age, Jesus already had phenomenal understanding

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.320
of the Scriptures.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:15.519
Those of us who observed him should have seen that this was no ordinary boy.

00:11:15.519 --> 00:11:18.519
The young man has asked a very good question.

00:11:18.519 --> 00:11:20.519
Kielib, Duol.

00:11:20.519 --> 00:11:23.519
Kwan, give him an answer.

00:11:23.519 --> 00:11:24.519
My son.

00:11:24.519 --> 00:11:28.519
These are the mysteries only God can answer.

00:11:28.519 --> 00:11:32.519
Also, you need to keep in mind that not every single word

00:11:32.519 --> 00:11:35.519
of these prophecies can be taken literally.

00:11:35.519 --> 00:11:37.519
Please, excuse my questions.

00:11:37.519 --> 00:11:41.519
But if these prophecies are not always meant to be taken literally,

00:11:41.519 --> 00:11:44.519
how do you know that the Messiah will be a real person

00:11:44.519 --> 00:11:46.519
and not a symbol of something else?

00:11:46.519 --> 00:11:51.519
My brothers, the boy's questions are valid.

00:11:51.519 --> 00:11:54.519
Jesus, do you have an opinion on these matters?

00:11:54.519 --> 00:11:57.519
My parents have taught me that the Messiah is real.

00:11:57.519 --> 00:12:00.519
But might his mission, his life,

00:12:00.519 --> 00:12:03.519
and his work in this land prove to be quite different

00:12:03.519 --> 00:12:05.519
than what is widely expected?

00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:08.519
I understand that in the end, people of all nations will be blessed

00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:10.519
by means of the Messiah.

00:12:10.519 --> 00:12:17.519
By myself and old, I can only hope to see that day come.

00:12:17.519 --> 00:12:20.519
When do you think the Messiah will come?

00:12:20.519 --> 00:12:22.519
My honorable teachers.

00:12:22.519 --> 00:12:24.519
I've also been taught that Jehovah our Father

00:12:24.519 --> 00:12:28.519
has placed the times and seasons within His own jurisdiction.

00:12:28.519 --> 00:12:31.519
In the meantime, I strive to draw closer to the Creator,

00:12:31.519 --> 00:12:34.519
doing the things He has commanded.

00:12:34.519 --> 00:13:05.240
Never has a young lad spoken with such wisdom.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:09.240
This is the synagogue in Nazareth,

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:13.830
one of many synagogues throughout Israel,

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:15.830
and in other lands too,

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:21.139
it is customary for the Jews to congregate in these buildings,

00:13:21.139 --> 00:13:26.139
to read the Scriptures, to pray, and to praise God.

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:30.139
In some synagogues, a chest like this one was kept,

00:13:30.139 --> 00:13:32.139
to store scrolls of the Holy writings.

00:13:32.139 --> 00:13:37.000
It was Jesus' custom on the Sabbath day

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
to come to this synagogue in Nazareth and read.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Likely, it was here in this synagogue

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
that Jesus, for the first time,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
read portions of God's inspired word.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
I imagine young Jesus coming to this synagogue

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
to examine the Holy writings carefully and to meditate on them.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Jesus had a flawless memory, even as a child.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
So imagine how much He must have learned.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
I can also picture young Jesus,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
perhaps 13 or 14 years old,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
standing before His teachers in the synagogue

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
and reading publicly from the Scriptures.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:28.539
Listen, O Israel.

00:14:28.539 --> 00:14:33.539
Jehovah, our God, is one Jehovah.

00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:36.539
You must love Jehovah, your God, with all your heart,

00:14:36.539 --> 00:14:40.539
and all your soul, and all your strength.

00:14:40.539 --> 00:14:42.539
These words that I am commanding you today

00:14:42.539 --> 00:14:44.539
must be on your heart,

00:14:44.539 --> 00:14:47.539
and you must inculcate them in your sons,

00:14:47.539 --> 00:14:49.539
and speak of them when you sit in your house,

00:14:49.539 --> 00:14:51.539
and when you walk on the road,

00:14:51.539 --> 00:14:54.539
and when you lie down, and when you get up.

00:14:54.539 --> 00:14:57.539
Tie them as a reminder on your hand,

00:14:57.539 --> 00:15:00.539
and they must be like a headband on your forehead.

00:15:00.539 --> 00:15:03.539
Write them on the doorposts of your house,

00:15:03.539 --> 00:15:19.879
and on your gates.

00:15:19.879 --> 00:15:21.879
Years went by.

00:15:21.879 --> 00:15:24.879
Jesus became a mature man, known in the community,

00:15:24.879 --> 00:15:27.879
as the carpenter, son of Joseph.

00:15:27.879 --> 00:15:31.879
He was a skilled craftsman, and a hard worker.

00:15:32.879 --> 00:15:35.879
He was also quite pleasant and likable,

00:15:35.879 --> 00:15:38.879
and he had outstanding wisdom.

00:15:38.879 --> 00:15:40.879
But during all that time,

00:15:40.879 --> 00:15:43.879
His wisdom went mostly unnoticed.

00:15:43.879 --> 00:15:46.879
Jesus did not make any disciples.

00:15:46.879 --> 00:15:50.879
Neither did He become a disciple of any of the rabbinic schools.

00:15:50.879 --> 00:15:53.879
He was virtually unknown.

00:15:53.879 --> 00:15:55.879
He had performed no miracles.

00:15:55.879 --> 00:15:59.879
Nothing obvious pointed to Him as the Messiah.

00:15:59.879 --> 00:16:01.879
Until one day,

00:16:01.879 --> 00:16:05.879
when He was baptized in the waters of the River Jordan,

00:16:05.879 --> 00:16:09.220
as He was praying,

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.220
He saw the heavens being parted,

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:14.220
and the Holy Spirit in bodily form,

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:16.220
like a dove came down upon Him,

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:20.220
and God's own voice came out of heaven.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:24.220
You are my son, who bellowed.

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:27.220
I have approved you.

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:34.820
This was undeniable evidence of Jesus' Messiahship.

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.820
Jehovah's own voice,

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:41.230
identifying Jesus as the Savior.

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:42.230
When I heard about it,

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:45.230
it stirred deep emotions within me.

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:47.230
It strengthened my faith,

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:51.230
and I was convinced that for a certainty,

00:16:51.230 --> 00:17:09.500
God had made Jesus, both Lord and Christ.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.500
Shortly after Jesus' baptism,

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:16.500
He began a preaching campaign in the districts of Galilee and Judea.

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:20.500
The word about His wisdom and His miracles spread throughout the land,

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.500
and the people in His hometown of Nazareth

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.500
had great expectations for Him.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.500
About a year after His baptism,

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:30.500
He returned to Nazareth

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:34.500
and made a very important statement.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:36.500
It happened in this synagogue,

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:39.500
where He had worshipped as a youth.

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:44.500
Please, observe and see it with your own eyes.

00:17:44.500 --> 00:18:04.750
The scroll of Isaiah the prophet reads,

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:08.750
Jehovah's Spirit is upon me,

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:13.750
because He anointed me to declare good news to the poor.

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:17.750
He sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:19.750
and a recovery of sight to the blind,

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:22.750
to send the crushed ones away free.

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:25.750
To preach, Jehovah's acceptable year.

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:39.940
Today, this scripture that you just heard is fulfilled.

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:59.740
This was a momentous event.

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:02.740
Jesus, in all His humility,

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:05.740
finds an unpretentious way to announce publicly

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:09.740
that He had been anointed to declare good news

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:11.740
and to bring relief to the crushed ones

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:15.740
and freedom to the oppressed.

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:17.740
No wonder the people at the synagogue

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:20.740
were amazed at hearing Jesus' words.

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:22.740
But there was a problem.

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:26.740
These people had false expectations.

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:29.740
They thought that having Jesus in their midst

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:33.740
would result in immediate physical benefits.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:36.740
They felt that if Jesus were truly a prophet,

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:40.740
He would perform many miracles among them,

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:43.740
especially because He was from their town Nazareth.

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:45.740
When Jesus told them

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:48.740
that He would not be giving them special treatment,

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:51.740
they quickly turned against Him.

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:54.740
Instantly, this crowd who had honored Him

00:19:54.740 --> 00:20:00.500
became an angry mob bent on killing Him.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.500
This is no prophet.

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.500
He is just another imposter.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:08.500
A lowly carburetor cannot possibly be a true prophet of God.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.500
This Jesus is nothing but a deceiver, a pretender,

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.500
removing him from the synagogue.

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:44.240
Throw him off the cliff!

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:48.240
Did Jesus escape the murderous mob in Nazareth?

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.240
Was it a miracle?

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.240
Or was it a clever trick,

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.240
a product of his ingenuity?

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:58.240
Someone still could have questioned Jesus credentials.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.240
Someone could have doubted his authenticity

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.579
as one sent by God.

00:21:03.579 --> 00:21:06.579
Indeed, if we allow doubts to take root,

00:21:06.579 --> 00:21:10.579
they can prevent us from seeing undeniable realities

00:21:10.579 --> 00:21:13.579
right in front of our eyes.

00:21:13.579 --> 00:21:15.579
In my case,

00:21:15.579 --> 00:21:17.579
during all these years,

00:21:17.579 --> 00:21:20.579
I have had to remind myself continuously

00:21:20.579 --> 00:21:23.579
to meditate on the undeniable realities

00:21:23.579 --> 00:21:27.579
that identify Jesus as the Messiah.

00:21:27.579 --> 00:21:30.579
That is how I build my faith

00:21:30.579 --> 00:21:33.579
and how I hold on to my strong conviction

00:21:33.579 --> 00:21:35.579
that I have the truth

00:21:35.579 --> 00:21:37.579
that for a certainty,

00:21:37.579 --> 00:21:41.579
God made Jesus, both Lord and Christ,

00:21:41.579 --> 00:21:43.579
come and see for yourself

00:21:43.579 --> 00:21:46.579
some more of this undeniable evidence.

00:21:46.579 --> 00:22:16.940
Pardon me, good women.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.940
I heard that Jesus the Nazarene is somewhere in the area.

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:21.940
Have you seen him?

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:23.940
Why are you seeking him out?

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:25.940
Are you one of his disciples?

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:27.940
Are you one of his servants?

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:28.940
My dear woman,

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:30.940
from what I hear the size of the crowds

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:32.940
will not allow you to come near Jesus.

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:34.940
Do not even dream of meeting him.

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:36.940
Sisters,

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:39.940
where is your love of strangers?

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:42.940
Please excuse the rudeness.

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:44.940
How can we be of assistance?

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:47.940
Come, sit here with us.

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.940
Thank you.

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:52.940
I have an urgent need to meet the Lord Jesus.

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:55.940
Well, I'm not sure he's any kind of Lord,

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.940
but I can tell you I've heard no reports

00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:59.940
about Jesus being around here.

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:01.940
Are you related to him?

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:02.940
No.

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.940
But I heard that he's curing the sick.

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:10.660
A very sick woman.

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:15.660
I've suffered from a flow of blood for some 12 years.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:19.660
I've been unable to get a cure from anyone.

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:27.140
And I've suffered so much at the hands of many physicians.

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:32.140
All of my money has been spent on this dreadful condition.

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:36.140
And after all these efforts, am I better?

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:38.140
No.

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:40.140
I have become worse.

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:44.900
When I heard about Jesus

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:48.900
and the miracles that he has performed,

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.900
I knew he must be from God.

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:53.900
I have faith in his power.

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:55.900
He can heal me,

00:23:55.900 --> 00:24:01.900
even if I could touch just the fringes of his outer garment.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:03.900
I will get well.

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:08.650
I will surely die.

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:13.980
Teach her.

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:15.980
Teach her again.

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:17.980
I plead with you.

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:19.980
My little daughter is extremely ill.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.980
Please, come and put your hands on her.

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:24.980
So she may get well and live.

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:28.980
Please, come to my house.

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:30.980
Jesus, this is Jeris,

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:32.980
one of the presiding officers of the synagogue.

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:35.980
He has been begging for your help.

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:37.980
Jeris, where is your daughter?

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:38.980
Please take me to her.

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:40.980
She's a beautiful girl.

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:42.980
She is my only daughter.

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:44.980
She is only 12 years old and she is dying.

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:47.980
Please, come quickly.

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:49.980
I will come.

00:24:49.980 --> 00:25:05.900
Please, lead the way.

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:07.900
Who touched my outer garments?

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:09.900
Who touched me?

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:10.900
Not me, my Lord.

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:13.900
Peter, James, did one of you touch me?

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:14.900
No, my Lord.

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:17.900
Jesus, surely you can see the crowds pressing in on you.

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:18.900
Can you ask?

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:19.900
Who touched me?

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:20.900
Someone touched me.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:22.900
For I know that power went out of me.

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:25.900
Woman, did you touch the Lord?

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:36.980
I have touched you.

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:40.980
I merely touched the fringes of his outer garments.

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:46.950
Have no fear.

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:48.950
You've done nothing wrong.

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:51.950
Tell me, why did you touch my garment?

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:59.440
I have been very ill for 12 years.

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:03.440
Many physicians have treated me.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:07.440
I have spent all that I had trying to find a cure

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:10.440
but my condition got no better.

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.440
Rather, I got worse.

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.440
I've heard about you.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:18.440
I have faith in you.

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:22.440
I knew that if I could just touch the fringes

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:25.440
of your outer garment, I could get well.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.440
Forgive me.

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.440
I just wanted to get well.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:33.099
Take courage, daughter.

00:26:33.099 --> 00:26:36.099
Your faith has made you well.

00:26:36.099 --> 00:27:00.519
Go in peace and be healed from your grievous sickness.

00:27:00.519 --> 00:27:05.519
Jarris, Jarris, your daughter has died.

00:27:05.519 --> 00:27:07.519
Let me take you home.

00:27:07.519 --> 00:27:11.519
My father, the teacher, any longer.

00:27:11.519 --> 00:27:16.930
Jarris, I am sorry about your little daughter.

00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:18.930
But have no fear.

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:21.930
Only have faith and she will be saved.

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:37.779
Take me to see her.

00:27:37.779 --> 00:27:40.779
Stop weeping for she did not die.

00:27:41.779 --> 00:27:47.269
But it's sleeping.

00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:51.269
Please move away from the house.

00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:53.269
Jarris, make sure the people stay out.

00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:56.269
You and your wife come with me please.

00:27:56.269 --> 00:28:01.769
Peter, James, John, come with me please.

00:28:01.769 --> 00:28:03.769
Jesus, she's already dead.

00:28:03.769 --> 00:28:12.660
I beg all of you, wait outside please.

00:28:12.660 --> 00:29:02.519
Little girl, I say to you, get up.

00:29:02.519 --> 00:29:05.519
Teacher, I am forever indebted to you.

00:29:05.519 --> 00:29:07.519
My daughter, my only child, she's back.

00:29:07.519 --> 00:29:08.519
Thank you.

00:29:08.519 --> 00:29:10.519
Thank you.

00:29:10.519 --> 00:29:25.089
Jarris, I must insist on your discretion regarding this matter.

00:29:25.089 --> 00:29:27.089
Please do not tell anyone that the girl was indeed dead

00:29:27.089 --> 00:29:29.089
and that she was brought back to life.

00:29:29.089 --> 00:29:35.980
Now this little girl is hungry.

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:37.980
Bring her something to eat.

00:29:37.980 --> 00:30:22.029
I have news to share with you two.

00:30:22.029 --> 00:30:23.029
Yes, something new.

00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:24.029
Are you pregnant?

00:30:24.029 --> 00:30:26.029
No, no, nothing like that.

00:30:26.029 --> 00:30:28.029
It has to do with what happened last week.

00:30:28.029 --> 00:30:30.029
Are the commotion in Jarris house?

00:30:30.029 --> 00:30:31.029
Yes.

00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:33.029
And what happened with that sick woman we met?

00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:36.029
Please do not tell me those miracles were real.

00:30:36.029 --> 00:30:39.029
They were more likely the tricks of a magician.

00:30:39.029 --> 00:30:42.029
You are such a skeptical woman.

00:30:42.029 --> 00:30:45.029
Not only do I believe in these miracles,

00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:50.029
but last night my husband and I decided to join Jesus.

00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:51.029
As is disciples.

00:30:51.029 --> 00:30:53.029
I do not believe you.

00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:56.029
You are too wise to join that sect.

00:30:56.029 --> 00:30:59.029
And how is it that you are so convinced about the miracles?

00:30:59.029 --> 00:31:00.029
Think about it.

00:31:00.029 --> 00:31:03.029
How do you know the woman was really sick?

00:31:03.029 --> 00:31:05.029
All you know is what she told you.

00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:08.029
How do you know that she was really healed?

00:31:08.029 --> 00:31:11.029
And even if she was, was it the result of a miracle?

00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:15.029
The sick woman seemed very sincere and factual.

00:31:15.029 --> 00:31:16.029
I do believe her.

00:31:16.029 --> 00:31:18.029
And what about Jarris daughter?

00:31:18.029 --> 00:31:20.029
She was dead.

00:31:20.029 --> 00:31:21.029
Dead.

00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:23.029
And Jesus brought her back to life.

00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:26.029
I was hoping you would bring that up.

00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:28.029
Remember, I was there.

00:31:28.029 --> 00:31:32.029
I saw when Jesus expelled everyone from the house.

00:31:32.029 --> 00:31:35.029
He went in with his three friends and the girl's parents.

00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:37.029
That is all.

00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:39.029
Who knows what really happened in that room?

00:31:39.029 --> 00:31:40.029
Exactly.

00:31:40.029 --> 00:31:43.029
The girl was alive not long before Jesus arrived at the house.

00:31:43.029 --> 00:31:46.029
How do we know that she was really dead?

00:31:46.029 --> 00:31:47.029
True.

00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:49.029
Jesus himself said that she was not dead.

00:31:49.029 --> 00:31:51.029
I heard it myself.

00:31:51.029 --> 00:31:55.029
He said, stop weeping for she did not die.

00:31:55.029 --> 00:31:57.029
But is sleeping.

00:31:57.029 --> 00:31:58.029
Sleeping.

00:31:58.029 --> 00:32:01.029
So was she dead or was she sleeping?

00:32:01.029 --> 00:32:03.029
You have a little faith.

00:32:03.029 --> 00:32:06.029
My dear friend, remember last year?

00:32:06.029 --> 00:32:09.029
The man from Shiloh who claimed to be a prophet?

00:32:09.029 --> 00:32:11.029
There were rumors of miracles.

00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:13.029
But then one day the truth came out.

00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:15.029
And he was exposed as an imposter.

00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:18.029
Well, I believe the woman was sick.

00:32:18.029 --> 00:32:20.029
And healed by Jesus.

00:32:20.029 --> 00:32:22.029
I know Jarris daughter was sick.

00:32:22.029 --> 00:32:24.029
I have no reason.

00:32:24.029 --> 00:32:27.029
To think that anyone lied about her death.

00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:30.029
And then I saw her with my own eyes.

00:32:30.029 --> 00:32:34.029
She was eating and walking around.

00:32:34.029 --> 00:32:36.029
That is enough for me.

00:32:36.029 --> 00:32:38.029
And my family.

00:32:38.029 --> 00:32:40.029
We will follow Jesus.

00:32:40.029 --> 00:32:43.029
And we will make up our own minds on this matter.

00:32:43.029 --> 00:32:56.130
Doubt.

00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:57.130
Doubt.

00:32:57.130 --> 00:32:58.130
Doubt.

00:32:58.130 --> 00:32:59.130
Doubt.

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:04.130
Can you see how doubts can weaken one's faith?

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:06.130
So what must we do if we have doubts?

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:08.130
Ignore them.

00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:10.130
Simply not think about them.

00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:13.130
Two of these women, lack faith.

00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:15.130
Their outlook was fleshly.

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:19.130
Always looking for flaws in the truth.

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:22.130
But the one woman has a spiritual outlook.

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:25.130
She saw enough evidence to make a decision.

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:28.130
Rather than avoiding or ignoring the questions at hand.

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:32.130
She reviewed in her mind what she already knew.

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:38.339
She opened her eyes to all the evidence.

00:33:38.339 --> 00:33:41.339
And what is more, she decided to get more information.

00:33:41.339 --> 00:33:45.339
And to learn more by becoming one of Christ's disciples.

00:33:45.339 --> 00:33:48.339
That is how we should deal with doubts.

00:33:48.339 --> 00:33:51.339
Resolve them.

00:33:51.339 --> 00:33:55.339
How do I know that Jesus is the Messiah?

00:33:55.339 --> 00:34:00.339
I make it a point to remember what I know to be the facts.

00:34:00.339 --> 00:34:02.339
I remember that day.

00:34:02.339 --> 00:34:07.339
40 years ago when I saw and heard the angels announcing Jesus' birth.

00:34:07.339 --> 00:34:15.059
I remember when I journeyed to Bethlehem and met Mary in Joseph.

00:34:15.059 --> 00:34:20.059
When I myself saw the infant Jesus.

00:34:20.059 --> 00:34:24.059
I bring to mind the story of 12-year-old Jesus in the temple.

00:34:24.059 --> 00:34:27.570
I meditate on the miracles.

00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:32.570
The great signs that Jesus performed establishing His credentials.

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:39.570
And I pray to Jehovah to help me remember all the prophecies that were fulfilled in Jesus.

00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:50.570
I know for a certainty that God made Jesus, Lord and Christ.

00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:53.570
But this is not the end of my story.

00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:56.570
I would like to relate other accounts in Jesus' life

00:34:56.570 --> 00:35:01.570
that provide even stronger evidence of His authenticity as the Messiah.

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:07.570
Please come back and let me tell you some other fascinating stories.
