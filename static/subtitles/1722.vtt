00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:13.160
You get so happy when you sing with others.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:21.410
Do you hope a creator does like that?

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.410
The birds also sing.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.410
I feel that Jehovah is proud of me.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.410
The Scandinavia branch of his supervices

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.409
nine languages in audio and video production.

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:38.409
In the three largest languages, Swedish, Norwegian and Danish,

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:41.409
there are also three children choruses that help us

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:44.409
with the recordings of the songs for the become Jehovah's

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:47.409
friend series.

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:52.409
First, I listened very carefully to the American adult chorus.

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:57.409
I tried to spot where they breathe, where they pause,

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:00.409
and the overall mood in their way of singing.

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.409
Then, I listened to the music we have received.

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.409
I have a piano at home to practice the voices,

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.409
and figure out where the high notes and low notes are,

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.409
where the challenging parts are, and how I can pass this on to the children.

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.409
I also think about what the goal with the recording is,

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.409
how other children who listen to the song can feel the same joy as we feel

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.409
when we are singing and recording it.

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.409
Before the children arrive,

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.409
we make sure that all the equipment is prepared and tested,

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.409
so everything is ready when they come here.

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.409
When we receive the assignment to participate in the recordings of a new song,

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.409
I feel that our girls have been full of initiative to practice,

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.409
and we have made it our custom to sing the songs and our family worship.

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.409
When we are driving to the RTO for the recordings and on other occasions,

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.409
we usually sing in the car.

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.409
I like to sing the songs because they are good and have nice melodies.

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:15.409
I especially like the new songs because they are so different.

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:19.409
One has African drums in it, and the next is a bit Irish,

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:25.849
and like you are walking in a valley and on a mountain.

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.849
Alma plays the cello, and has asked to get the sheet music for the New Kingdom songs,

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.849
which are her favorites right now.

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:41.289
It's been a challenge for Andre and me because we are not that musical.

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:45.289
There is also a serious part,

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:48.289
so we start with a prayer to Jehovah.

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:53.289
Then we watch the video and talk about the point of the video,

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:58.289
and how other children and families can benefit when listening to them.

00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:03.289
Then we need to loosen up a bit, so we warm up with some exercises,

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:32.340
and then we are ready to sing.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.340
It is clear to us that they appreciate their privilege more and more.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.340
They actually see it as praise to Jehovah.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.340
The joy they have of singing for Jehovah rubs off and asks who work with them.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.659
When the children sing with joy and express themselves freely,

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:58.659
it has an effect on us as parents and the ones in the congregation.

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:01.659
Jehovah becomes happy when he sees it,

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:05.659
and also when he brothers and sisters and children become happy.

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:08.659
It is fun to make the recordings, you get so happy,

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:14.419
and then it's more fun to sing at meetings.

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:21.420
I see more clearly why we sing, and why it is a part of our worship.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.420
We don't go there just to spend time with our friends.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.420
We go there to sing. It is a part of praising Jehovah.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.420
Singing is like a prayer to him.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:38.420
I have been humming the songs, and people around me wonder what it is I am always humming,

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.420
so it has helped me, and it is an easy way to give a witness.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.420
My faith in Jehovah is stronger now.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.420
Yes, it is a gap.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.420
I think that I am happier knowing Jehovah after I began singing.

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.420
You understand that singing is a huge part of our worship,

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.420
and Jehovah wants us to use it.
