00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:08.080
Well this morning I invite you to open up your Bible with me to Revelation chapter 7 and let's review a few highlights of this

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.080
extremely exciting prophecy in its context

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:21.600
doing so will help us to see what will strengthen our desire to work hard for Jehovah in our various assignments

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.399
As you look at Revelation chapter 7 verses 1 to 3

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.960
You'll notice quickly what John saw and heard

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.560
four angels holding back destructive winds from harming the earth and the sea

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:41.840
what's it teach us? Right now though invisible to our eyes

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:47.359
powerful angels are holding back the destructive winds of the great tribulation

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:54.240
what are they waiting for? Verse 3 indicates that one key event involves the confirmation

00:00:54.799 --> 00:01:02.799
that the remaining ones on earth of the 144,000 have been finally sealed for their heavenly reward

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:12.159
verses 4 to 8 go on to give us assurance that the full number of spiritual Israel will be sealed

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.640
think of that soon the full staff making up our heavenly government will be installed

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.319
then it will be out with the new out with the old and in with the new the new kingdom government

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:34.239
ruling over the entire earth but now where to those with an earthly hope fit in to this prophecy

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:38.400
let's read together verses 9 and 10 of Revelation chapter 7

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:48.159
After this I saw and perhaps with a measure of excitement and awe John says and look a great crowd

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.239
which no man was able to number out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues

00:01:54.959 --> 00:02:01.120
standing before the throne and before the lamb dressed in white roads and there were palm branches

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:08.639
in their hands and they keep shouting with a loud voice saying salvation we owe to our God who

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:17.199
has seated on the throne and to the lamb our date text in verse 14 goes on to explain that these

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:24.159
are the ones who come out of the great tribulation well what does the prophecy remind us

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:32.479
it clearly indicates that today a great crowd and unnumbered multilingual multinational

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:40.319
multi tribal crowd of people are being gathered who will survive the coming great tribulation

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:47.599
of course as we've researched and read we know that after this prophecy was clarified

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:54.960
for Jehovah's people in 1935 a common question circulated among Jehovah's people

00:02:55.919 --> 00:03:03.520
how great will the great crowd turn out to be you know that's still an intriguing question

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:10.319
today the great crowd numbers over 8 million but it's growing every year

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:20.080
did you know that during the last five service years from 2016 through 2020 over 1.3 million

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:27.759
new disciples were baptized during the last five service years that's an average of over 750 new

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:37.120
disciples every day and early indications for this year the 2021 service year are that the fields

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.680
continue to be very white for harvesting i thought it would be encouraging to share with you two

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:51.520
examples that we received in the service committee office recently in april 2021 a branch office

00:03:51.919 --> 00:04:00.879
much untouched territory and a ratio of one publisher to over 20 000 persons submitted this report

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:07.840
i quote despite the pandemic we have been greatly encouraged to see sustained and accelerated

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:17.199
growth in the field we have observed publisher peaks continue for 27 months in a row in spite of

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:24.879
a nationwide lockdown and the exodus of need graders the same branch territory reported during

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:32.959
the 2020 service year a five percent publisher increase the report goes on the number of

00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:39.199
bible studies has steadily increased meeting attendances have also progressively increased

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:46.720
the 2021 memorial attendance was a 20 percent increase over 2020 which is more than three times the

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:54.399
number of publishers in one of their main language fields the branch reports that in spite of extreme

00:04:54.399 --> 00:05:02.720
poverty malnutrition illiteracy lack of electricity and internet they are seeing an explosion of

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:10.240
interest in the bible consider the report from just one congregation in this region one congregation

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:17.439
with 30 publishers which includes four temporary special pioneers is reporting 126 bible studies

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:23.439
but we have to look a little deeper to get the full story the branch reports that a bible study

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:30.399
in this congregation is often a group of eight to ten bible students studying the bible together

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:38.800
they have over 300 regularly attending the meetings and at the memorial this year the congregation

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:49.439
of 30 had more than 2,200 in attendance each bible student is conducting dozens of his or her own

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:57.040
bible studies and they in turn are conducting their own studies people in this area the branch

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:04.079
reports are desperately hungering and thirsting for spiritual truth what an encouraging report

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:11.920
like Jesus as we lift up our eyes and we view the fields what do we see tremendous potential

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:18.800
for the great crowd to be even greater than it is today brothers and sisters such reports of

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:24.720
increase are not isolated to lands with virgin territory one of the larger branches in europe

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:31.519
recently reported that for the 2021 memorial this past spring they experienced all time peaks in

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:38.079
eight of the 12 countries they oversee in the country where the branch office is located the

00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:49.279
last time they experienced a peak for the memorial was in 1994 27 years ago now that same country is

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:57.279
reporting all time peaks in publishers pioneers an increase in the number of reactivated publishers

00:06:57.279 --> 00:07:06.160
and a decrease in the number of publishers going inactive again what do we see when we look at the

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:16.160
fields you know we have to ask the question will hundreds of thousands more could millions more

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:23.920
join us in true worship before the end comes well we'll have to wait and see but what do we know

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:30.720
though the apostle john in his vision reported that no man was able to number the great crowd

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:38.560
we know that jahova and jesus know who belonged to them back in 2002 in an article entitled

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:46.879
how will they hear notice the comet made by the faithful slave i quote jahova is responsible

00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:52.959
for this work and is using his angels to oversee it he is the one to determine to what extent

00:07:52.959 --> 00:07:58.480
the witness is to be given to all the nations if jahova chooses he can see that the kingdom

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:03.759
message is spread in ways that we cannot yet imagine so that many more people may hear the word

00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:11.519
of the good news and believe in conclusion the article says what jahova does will be in full harmony

00:08:11.519 --> 00:08:21.709
with who he is a loving wise and just god you know in the first century when jesus saw the crowds

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:27.149
of people that were thrown about like sheep without a shepherd the bible reports that he felt

00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:37.309
pity deep seated motion that moved him to action on two occasions when he was with his disciples

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:43.789
here on the earth he said the harvest is great but the workers are few and then he encouraged us

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:50.509
to beg the master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest well how do we think jahova

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:57.389
and jesus feel about the harvest work today they see the need and they're responding to the need

00:08:57.389 --> 00:09:03.870
through the governing body through the oversight of branch committees worldwide how does this

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:10.509
strengthen us to support them in our assignments well jesus words to his disciples back then

00:09:10.509 --> 00:09:16.590
remind us that we want to keep begging the master of the harvest jahova to send out workers into

00:09:16.669 --> 00:09:23.549
his harvest our prayers for this work to be accomplished to the extent and on the scale that jahova

00:09:23.549 --> 00:09:32.509
desires will be answered but there's something more like jesus we can be the answer to that prayer

00:09:32.509 --> 00:09:40.110
by being workers in the harvest all of this is very encouraging and exciting a reminder that our

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:46.909
work here at Bethel or in various field assignments is not in vain brothers and sisters so may we

00:09:46.909 --> 00:09:54.190
today view our privileges the privilege to pray earnestly the privilege to preach and teach the

00:09:54.190 --> 00:10:01.870
privilege to support the kingdom work in various ways move us to do our part to contribute to the

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:09.470
great crowd turning out to be very great
