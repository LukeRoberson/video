00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.900
So our text is about being quick to listen, so we'd like to develop the theme listen with mildness

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:17.379
We'll talk about two points. Why is mildness essential for listening and how can mildness help us to be a better listener?

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:22.059
Let's take that first point. How is mildness connected with listening?

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:28.760
Let's turn in our Bibles to our text James chapter 1 and we'll read verses 19 through 21

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:31.719
Because James makes the connection for us

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.240
James chapter 1 verse 19

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.479
Does know this my beloved brothers everyone must be quick to listen slow to speak slow to anger

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:46.920
For man's anger does not bring about God's righteousness

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.399
Therefore put away all filthiness in every trace of badness

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.759
And except with mildness the implanting of the word which is able to save you

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.799
So here James is talking about listening to God's word and he says we need to be quick to listen

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.840
That means we have to control our reaction

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.480
We have to be slow to speak because when we start to speak we stop listening

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:15.319
And we also have to control our emotions because if we get angry

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.799
That's not going to work out God's righteousness will likely make matters worse

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.239
Instead the key is what he mentioned in verse 21

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.000
We need to have mildness that's going to help us accept

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.920
God's word to to listen to it quickly and accept it

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.760
And why is that the case?

00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:40.840
Well mildness involves self-control a person who is mild tempered is humble and their patient

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:44.920
They have a calm and calm and peaceful disposition

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.239
The scriptures describe a mild tempered person as teachable

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:53.959
Somebody who is willing and ready to submit to God's will

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:58.519
So mildness is essential if we're to listen to God's word

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:05.319
And doesn't that explain why so many people today are not quick to listen to what the Bible says

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.199
The insight volume makes this statement

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:12.919
It's as lack of mildness of temper is the result of insecurity

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:15.240
frustration

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.680
Lack of faith and hope and even desperation

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:23.000
And doesn't that describe the world that we live in today

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.560
Satan's got people so emotionally wound up that they're not mild tempered

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.319
He's got them feeling insecure

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.639
They feel threatened and afraid of being taken advantage of

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:37.319
And for that reason they're not open to any agreement. They don't trust other people

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.000
Satan's got people feeling frustrated

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.520
Life in this system is unfair and unjust

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.520
And that hardens people making them resentful and bitter

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.360
And the institutions in this system of things have robbed people of their faith and their hope

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.800
And it's no wonder that people are skeptical and suspicious

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:03.960
And all of that has left people feeling in despair, distressed and anxious

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.960
And Satan likes it that way

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.560
He wants people to not be mild tempered because he knows

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.120
If they're not mild tempered, they won't be quick to listen to God's word

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:21.000
Yet with Jehovah's help, anyone can gradually develop a mild temper

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:25.000
With Jehovah's word and his spirit, he gives us the

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.719
The reason and the ability to do so

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:33.000
He gives us the ability to control our reaction

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.439
And through his word, he gives us the reasons to feel secure

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.120
To feel calm, to have strong faith and hope

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.120
And as a result, we can trust him

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.439
We don't have to take matters in our own hands

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:49.560
So, mildness is essential to listening to God's word

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.599
It's the quality that loosens the soil of our heart

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.919
Then allows God's word to be implanted there

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.800
But mildness can also help us become a better listener

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.520
And to see that we have only to look at the wonderful example of Jesus

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.759
Jesus was mild tempered and as a result, he was approachable

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:12.520
He created opportunities for him to listen to other people

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.120
Turn, if you will, in your Bible to Matthew chapter 11

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.839
We'll read verses 28 and 29

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:23.720
And notice this warm appeal by Jesus

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.639
Matthew 28 or Matthew 11 verses 28 and 29

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.120
He says, Come to me, all you who are toiling and loaded down

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.480
And I will refresh you

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:36.600
Take my yoke upon you and learn from me

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:39.560
Fry mild tempered and lowly in heart

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.439
And you will find refreshment for yourselves

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.240
Yes, Jesus was mild tempered and that made him approachable

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:51.079
People found it easy to talk to Jesus

00:04:51.079 --> 00:04:54.439
They never wondered what kind of mood Jesus was going to be in that day

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:58.040
Jesus wasn't touchy or thin skinned or moody

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.800
People didn't fear his reaction

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.439
They sensed that Jesus really wanted to listen to them

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.800
So consider some examples of that

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:15.800
Martha felt free to approach Jesus to vent her frustration and complain about her sister Mary

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:23.240
Both Mary and Martha felt safe venting their emotions to Jesus when Lazarus died

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.279
And remember the first words they said to him

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:27.959
It could have sounded insensitive

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.120
If you had only been here my brother would not have died

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.680
Recall the occasion when James and John asked Jesus for special favors

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.800
Now they did that just shortly after Jesus said that he would suffer and die

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.879
And although Peter was misguided

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:51.879
He felt comfortable pulling Jesus aside to offer him some counsel

00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:57.000
What's the point people felt free talking to Jesus

00:05:57.079 --> 00:06:01.000
To ask for things to express their emotions to voice their concerns

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:08.360
And even though what they said may have seemed petty, insensitive, misguided or even wrong

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.399
Jesus never overreacted

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:15.160
He always dignified them dealt with them in a mild way

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.759
Even when he had to give them strong reproof or counsel

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.160
And what's amazing is that Jesus likely often knew what people were going to say

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:29.399
And yet he never finished their sentences he never interrupted them

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:32.839
He dignified them he let them express themselves

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.560
And what a good lesson for us

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.519
If we're mild tempered that'll help us to become approachable

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:44.920
Creating opportunities for us to be quick to listen to other people

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.160
And unlike Jesus we need to listen to what other people say

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.279
That's the only way that we'll know how we can help them

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:58.839
And it's the only way that will remain approachable so that we may receive the counsel and suggestions that we may need

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.810
Now a second way that Jesus set an example in mildness

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.290
Is he didn't overreact to what he heard

00:07:08.329 --> 00:07:10.250
Why was that?

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:15.529
Well turn in your Bibles please to 1 Peter chapter 2 and verse 23

00:07:16.329 --> 00:07:18.329
And note this statement

00:07:18.329 --> 00:07:20.329
You're regarding Jesus 1 Peter

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:21.769
2 23

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:26.810
It says when he was being insulted he did not insult in return

00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:29.529
When he was suffering he did not threaten

00:07:30.329 --> 00:07:34.009
But he entrusted himself to the one who judges righteously

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:39.610
Yes, Jesus kept himself under control because he entrusted himself

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:45.370
To Jehovah he knew that Jehovah would deal with all the injustices that he faced

00:07:45.689 --> 00:07:49.689
Jesus knew that there was nothing that anybody could say to him or about him

00:07:50.089 --> 00:07:52.329
That would change how Jehovah felt about him

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:55.850
And that made Jesus feel secure

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.850
He didn't lose focus

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:00.410
He didn't take matters into his own hands

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:01.610
He didn't overreact

00:08:02.569 --> 00:08:05.689
Now meditating on Jesus example can help us

00:08:05.689 --> 00:08:07.209
It can help us when we face

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:12.730
insulting comments from opposers or malicious statements by

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:13.850
Opposers

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:17.449
But it can also help us deal with day-to-day conversations

00:08:18.329 --> 00:08:21.290
You know sometimes somebody may say something that shows

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:24.410
That they've misunderstood us or maybe misjudged us

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.290
Or maybe they phrase something in a way

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:30.009
That sounds like they're challenging our authority

00:08:30.569 --> 00:08:32.889
Or maybe they make a joke at our expense

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:38.409
All of those things can make us feel insecure and frustrated

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:42.730
But if we have mildness rooted in a relationship with Jehovah

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:44.730
We'll stay calm and secure

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:46.730
We won't lose our focus

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:48.649
We won't overreact

00:08:50.009 --> 00:08:53.129
Yes, mildness is essential for listening

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:56.250
If it will help us to be quick to listen

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.690
To God's words so that it can be implanted in our hearts

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:02.809
And it'll help us to be better listeners

00:09:02.809 --> 00:09:05.129
By helping us to become approachable

00:09:05.129 --> 00:09:07.129
And not overreacting to what we hear
