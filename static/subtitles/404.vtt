00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:05.120
Jehovah, the God of love, hates.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.640
That's quite a statement, isn't it? How can that be?

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.439
Well, look at the first part of today's text at Psalm 9710.

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:18.239
O you who love Jehovah, hate what is bad.

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:22.960
Our God expects us to hate what is bad because he does that.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.559
And the reason for this is explained in the first two verses of Psalm 97.

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:30.519
Verse 1 begins, Jehovah has become king.

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:37.079
Verse 2 concludes, righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.880
And in the scriptures, righteousness refers to what is right according to God's standard

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.960
of right and wrong. And here are just a few examples in the Bible of the things that Jehovah says

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:58.359
are wrong and that he hates. At Psalm 115, it says, Jehovah hates anyone who loves violence.

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.000
At Isaiah 61-8, it says, I Jehovah hate robbery and unrighteousness.

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:14.519
At Malachi 216, it states, I hate divorce says Jehovah, the context talking about treacherous

00:01:14.519 --> 00:01:20.280
unscriptural divorce. And then there's Proverbs chapter 6. Let's turn in our Bibles to that.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.609
Proverbs the sixth chapter, starting with verse 16, there are six things that Jehovah hates.

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:37.129
Yes, seven things that he detests, haughty eyes, a lion tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:44.650
a heart plodding wicked schemes and feet that run quickly to evil, a false witness who lies with

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:53.370
every breath and anyone sowing contentions among brothers. So yes, the God of love hates.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:01.129
And so does Jesus. Look at what was said of God's son at Hebrews chapter 1 and verse 9.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:10.569
Hebrews 1-9, you loved righteousness and you hated lawlessness. That is why God, your God,

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.889
anointed you with the oil of exaltation more than your companions.

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:22.810
Well, if we desire Jehovah's blessing, then we also must hate what is bad. That is have an

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:31.210
intense aversion, a strong abhorrence for what God hates. And having that godly hate serves as a

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:37.689
powerful protection for us not to get involved in any bad practices. But exactly what did these

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:45.530
include? Well, we just read in Proverbs seven categories of hateful things. They're basic,

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:52.090
but they cover virtually all types of wrongs. Haughty eyes and wicked schemes are sins committed in

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.810
thought. The lion tongue and a false witness are sinful words, hands that shed blood and feet

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:07.289
that run to evil, and someone who produces contentions among brothers, why those are all wicked

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.610
deeds. And interestingly, the writer, when he increased the number of things Jehovah hates from

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:20.729
six to seven, that suggests that this list is not intended to be complete, because humans

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:27.370
keep thinking up bad things. And as an example, consider the escalating trend toward the use of

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:35.530
more and more explicit sex and graphic violence that appear today in advertising and entertainment,

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:42.729
from clothing ads to movies. Now, how much of that can we be exposed to before it affects us

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:48.810
mentally and morally? It makes me think of the five second rule. Have you ever heard of that?

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.090
It's a so-called rule that some people say applies to food that's dropped on the floor.

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:59.370
That it's okay to eat it if you pick it up in five seconds or less, because bacteria won't

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:06.969
have time to contaminate it. But is that really true? Not according to research done last year

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:12.650
at Rutgers University. It was concluded that no matter how fast you pick up food that falls

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.930
on the floor, you will pick up bacteria with it sometimes and less than one second.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:23.449
Of course, the longer the food sits on the floor, the more bacteria it collects.

00:04:24.329 --> 00:04:30.329
So if you eat food dropped on the floor, you're taking a chance. No matter how long it's sat there,

00:04:30.329 --> 00:04:37.370
and you should know the clean-looking floor is not necessarily clean. So a food falls on the floor

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:44.490
when in doubt, throw it out. But how does this relate to our discussion of hating the things that

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:52.569
Jehovah hates? Well, how long does it take for an immoral, violent, or satanic image to burn a thought

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:59.290
in our mind? Something we see on a billboard, in a magazine, on television, at a movie,

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:05.129
on the internet. Is there a five-second rule for this sort of thing? Should we think that as long

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:12.889
as we look at it only briefly, it will not contaminate us? Well, let's use five seconds as an example

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:18.250
and see how long that is, and you can judge for yourselves. Don't take your eyes off the screen.

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:29.000
Now, do you think at lunch today you'll be able to remember that picture?

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:36.120
Delicious-looking chocolate ice-cream sundae was syrup in a cherry on top? Well,

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:42.759
don't expect to see it on the lunch line. Now, let's try four seconds. What about this image?

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.740
Will this cute baby's face come back to your mind tomorrow next week?

00:05:55.019 --> 00:05:58.699
Now, watch the screen for three seconds. Will this image stick in your mind?

00:06:05.079 --> 00:06:11.399
Next month, next year, do you think you will be able to remember Jesus on a white horse riding

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:16.600
off to the Battle of Armageddon? Now, you saw each picture for only a few seconds,

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:23.639
and yet scientists say the human brain can process images in even less time in a split second

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:30.920
in the blink of an eye. So, think how much processing our brain can do in several seconds,

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:37.560
or minutes, or longer. Now, the pictures we just looked at were all wholesome images,

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.920
but what if there had been a pornographic picture from the internet,

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:46.839
a sexually explicit or graphically violent scene from a movie, or some

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:53.399
spiritistic gore in a video game? If we gaze at something that Jehovah hates, we're taking a chance

00:06:53.399 --> 00:07:00.199
no matter how long we look at it, and that graphic image can come back to mind again and again

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:07.399
to haunt us. Now, we may not be able to avoid all of this 100% because of the wicked world

00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:11.879
that surrounds us, but we certainly don't have to linger in looking at these things,

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:18.279
and we do not want to seek them out. And we need to realize that what we might think as a clean

00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:25.560
movie is not necessarily clean. So, like food that is fallen on the floor, when in doubt,

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:32.600
we throw it out. So, we need to detest the immorality, the violence, the spiritistic practices

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:39.000
of Satan's world. In other words, hate, every practice that violates Jehovah's Righteous standards.

00:07:40.279 --> 00:07:45.879
Now, even if we hate what is bad, we may struggle because we live in a world that caters to the flesh,

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:54.040
and we have our own sinful nature to control. So, how do we develop the needed hatred for what is

00:07:54.040 --> 00:08:03.160
bad? First, we strengthen our desire to please Jehovah in everything we do. Then we meditate on

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:09.560
what it is that he loves and what it is that he hates. And finally, we convince ourselves of the

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:17.000
badness of the things that he hates by considering how disgusting the results are for those who practice

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.879
them. And among one more thing, if we struggle with this, then we pray earnestly to Jehovah to help

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:32.840
strengthen our powers of self-control. Well, you can be sure that as our days text Psalm 9710 says of

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:38.600
those who imitate Jehovah and hate what is bad, he is guarding the lives of his loyal ones,

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:47.720
and he rescues them from the hand of the wicked.
