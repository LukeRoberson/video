00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:10.419
Work is a gift from God, and His inspired word tells us to be balanced in our view of work.

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:16.420
However, the world teaches extreme views of work that are contrary to God's view.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:25.420
Some have the view that work should be avoided at all costs, and they work hard at not working.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.420
Others have the view that the more you work, the happier you will be.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:41.420
As you watch the following dramatization, notice how our brother's emphasis on secular work actually robs him of joy.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:53.579
The company took on new clients this year, and I knew that Victor was really depending on me to keep things on schedule.

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.579
I didn't want to let him down.

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:11.519
So, I stepped up and took on the overtime hours. I figured it was temporary, and I even got to take home a bigger paycheck.

00:01:11.519 --> 00:01:18.790
The problem is that's not all I took home.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:33.640
By the end of each week, I was burned out.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:44.500
And the weekends, well, they weren't really any better.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:02:03.739
In fact, I spent a lot of Saturdays back at the office. The project took a lot longer than I thought.

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:10.740
That pretty much took out field service and the meetings. But I knew that management would be impressed.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.740
That machine is essential so I can get these parts in.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.740
I got the reports in right on time.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.740
Look, this is costing a lot of money. I got a first quarter that I have to meet, and without this, is going to kill me.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.099
You know, we had a contract that you were supposed to...

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:33.789
Like I said, I don't care about your third party event. This is unexpected.

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:40.789
I was working harder than ever. And in the end, I'm not sure anyone even cared.

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:51.620
We know that being industrious and working hard is good.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.620
But what did our brother and the video experience when he adopted the world's extreme view of work?

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.620
Did it make him happier?

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:07.620
If we put secular work above everything else, we could lose out unneeded rest and spiritual pursuits.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:14.620
Our brother in the video sacrificed precious time with his family and activity with the congregation

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.620
because he did not have a balanced view of secular work.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:29.620
Read with me what Ecclesiastes, chapter 4 and verse 6 indicates about being balanced. Ecclesiastes 4.6

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:36.620
Better is a handful of rest than two handfuls of hard work.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.620
Notice what it adds. And chasing after the wind.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.620
Chasing after the wind is an exercise in futility.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.620
You can't catch the wind and hold onto it.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.620
A person who was a workaholic may never enjoy the fruitage of his labor

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.620
if his work consumes all his time and energy.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.620
His work can become as pointless as chasing after the wind.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:12.620
We accept to enjoy our obligation to provide for ourselves and those who depend on us.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.620
But we also need to remember that there is more to life than work.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:26.620
Jehovah gives us the instructions we need to have a balanced life and have a proper view of work.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:33.620
For example, the Bible encourages us to work hard at what we do to make a living.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.620
And meaningful secular work can bring us joy and feeling of accomplishment.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.620
Whatever we do, we want to do it well.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:52.620
Also, as Ephesians 4.28 says, doing good work allows us to have something to share with someone in need.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.620
But we are advised in Scripture to make sure of the more important things.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:06.620
And the most important work we can do is stated clearly in 1 Corinthians chapter 15, verse 58.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:12.620
Please read with me 1 Corinthians 1558.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:23.620
Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always having plenty to do in the work of the Lord,

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:29.620
knowing that your labor is not in vain in connection with the Lord.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:38.620
Having plenty to do in the work of the Lord is good for us, and it is pleasing to Jehovah.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:51.620
As you watch the following dramatization, see how our brother benefits from working hard at his secular job and in spiritual pursuits.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:06:13.129
It had been a busy week, but the weekend was going to be even busier and better.

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:31.939
But first, I needed to make an important stop.

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:35.939
Hey John, how are you feeling?

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:38.939
Ben, how are you doing?

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:40.939
Good, good.

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:43.939
This illness had been so hard on John and Sandy.

00:06:43.939 --> 00:07:00.860
I couldn't even imagine what they were going through.

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.860
It was so encouraging to see John's positive attitude.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:11.550
The next day, we had a fantastic conversation in the ministry.

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:23.139
Then, Tom and I finally figured out that glitch in the AV system.

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:25.139
Okay Tom, go ahead and hit play.

00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:27.139
It's played.

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:28.139
Okay.

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:35.209
Everything looked and sounded great.

00:07:35.209 --> 00:07:48.600
We definitely were busy, but in the best way possible.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:53.600
Doing things that really mattered, and for people who love Jehovah.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:08:03.370
We saw a balanced and joyful man in that video.

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:11.370
Our brother worked hard at his secular job because it allowed him to provide for his family's physical needs.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:17.370
Did you notice in the video that the brother had a picture of his family at his workplace?

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:23.370
It was a nice reminder of one of the reasons why he was working hard.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:29.370
True, it may be that you work at a job you don't particularly enjoy doing.

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:38.370
Nevertheless, you work hard and give it your best because you're doing it for your family and for Jehovah.

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:48.370
And when you do your job well, the truth is that you can find pleasure in it or at least in what it provides.

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:55.370
Doing the work of the Lord includes work that we do in behalf of the congregation.

00:08:55.370 --> 00:09:02.370
We experience the greater happiness that comes from giving as stated at Acts 2035.

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:09.370
Did our brother in the video that we just observed give of himself to the congregation?

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:11.370
Yes, he did.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:17.370
He took the time to visit a brother in the hospital, and we know that such visits are truly appreciated.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:22.370
And he participated in the ministry to spread the good news of the kingdom.

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:28.370
He helped out at the kingdom hall to get the audio video set up working.

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:36.370
Like him, we make ourselves available for whatever has to be done to care for kingdom interests.

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:46.370
At the end of the day, our brother was with his family and friends probably very tired, but it was a good tired.

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:52.370
He was enjoying a period of relaxation and personal satisfaction.

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:58.370
Yes, all of his hard work brought him genuine happiness.

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:05.370
Truly, as Jehovah's servants, all of us want to be busy in the best ways possible.

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:14.370
Jehovah created us to enjoy both work and leisure as stated at Ecclesiastes 313.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:23.370
That everyone should eat and drink and find enjoyment for all his hard work.

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:27.370
It is the gift of God.

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:35.370
Keep your life balanced, and you will enjoy all of the work you do even more.

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:44.370
Please listen, as Brother James Mans, a helper to the writing committee, now considers the final talk of this symposium.

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:49.370
What contributes to joy? True friendships.
