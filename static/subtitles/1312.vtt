00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.700
The 20th century world has experienced an information explosion,

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.700
an explosion that actually began long ago.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:49.340
To the making of many books, there is no end.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.340
Stated King Solomon of Old,

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.100
there is an almost limitless supply of knowledge

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.100
on practically every subject imaginable.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:24.700
Sophisticated technology and stacks of cleverly written books

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.700
continue to fail in solving mankind's most basic problems.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:02:03.859
The vast storehouse of human knowledge

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:06.859
has not united people in peace.

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:07.859
Why?

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:15.569
Because mankind has turned its back on the most important wisdom

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.569
to be found anywhere, the wisdom of our creator, Jehovah God.

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:33.979
How fitting them, that divine teaching was selected as a theme

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:36.979
for a series of special international conventions

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:39.979
in Jehovah's Witnesses held around the world.

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:46.139
What brings individuals and families

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.139
from so many different countries together

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:51.139
in unity and peace?

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:54.139
To be further instructed in divine wisdom,

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:59.479
as the Bible foretold at mychach 4 and verse 2.

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:03.919
Many nations will certainly go and say,

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:04.919
come your people,

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:07.919
and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah.

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:10.919
And he will instruct us about his ways.

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:16.060
We are to acquire true wisdom

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.060
and really benefit from divine teaching.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.400
We must have acurban tayi matano.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.689
Many questions come to mind.

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:35.020
Who attend?

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.020
What do they learn?

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:42.740
How do they personally benefit from divine teaching?

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:53.360
First of all, we were the international conventions held.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:04:02.120
Johannesburg, South Africa,

00:04:02.120 --> 00:05:33.310
Manila, the Philippines, Santiago,

00:05:33.310 --> 00:07:05.540
Chile, Nairobi, Kenya, Hong Kong,

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.540
Bogota, Colombia.

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:37.779
Who attend the international divine teaching conventions?

00:07:38.779 --> 00:07:44.699
The Tonguanas live in Petersburg, South Africa.

00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:48.699
They begin each morning with a Bible text.

00:07:48.699 --> 00:07:56.699
Although both are over 80 years old,

00:07:56.699 --> 00:07:58.699
they are still very active

00:07:58.699 --> 00:08:04.959
with special pioneer ministers in the preaching work.

00:08:04.959 --> 00:08:20.149
The Suriano family lives in Manila, the Philippines.

00:08:20.149 --> 00:08:31.009
This family of eight also starts each day with a Bible text.

00:08:31.009 --> 00:08:33.009
They attribute their happy family life

00:08:33.009 --> 00:08:48.490
to their applying Bible principles.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:55.490
The Kavungi family lives in Catali, Kenya,

00:08:55.490 --> 00:09:05.799
in an apartment attached to the Kingdom Hall.

00:09:05.799 --> 00:09:08.799
The children are regular pioneer ministers.

00:09:08.799 --> 00:09:14.870
Parents, special pioneers.

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:17.870
The one family resides in the bustling metropolis of Hong Kong.

00:09:26.259 --> 00:09:29.259
They appreciate divine teaching as the best wisdom anywhere

00:09:29.259 --> 00:09:42.730
for making family life happy.

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:45.730
Well, ten more days before we leave for the United States.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:49.730
The fun of Estes and family lives in Johannesburg, South Africa.

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:58.730
They rely on practical wisdom from the Bible to stay united and happy.

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:09.500
Keeping the lines of communication open between parents and children is always a challenge.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:13.500
But it helps keep this family united in faith.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:19.500
Where Elisha is attending this piece,

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.500
she says,

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.500
good up your loins,

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.500
take this flask of oil in your hand,

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.500
and go to Raymouth Gilead.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.500
Good up your loins,

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.500
and take this flask of oil in your hand,

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.500
and go to Raymouth Gilead.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.500
When you have come in there, see Gigi,

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.500
the son of Johannes of Ben,

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.500
the son of Namjidev.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:44.500
The mentors live in Fakata Diva, Colombia.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.500
The convention in Bogota is very special to them,

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:55.500
as all five will symbolize their dedication to God by baptism.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:11:01.679
International conventions were held on five continents,

00:11:01.679 --> 00:11:04.679
and were heard by hundreds of thousands of people.

00:11:04.679 --> 00:11:09.570
All conventions sessions are free.

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:12.570
No collections ever taken.

00:11:15.679 --> 00:11:17.679
Besides the local populace,

00:11:17.679 --> 00:11:25.330
foreign delegates representing 64 countries attend.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.330
What brings people from so many countries?

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:33.330
They agree with King David's plea at Psalm 143 verse 10.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.330
Teach me to do your will.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:39.330
God's will touches our lives today,

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.330
and can shape out tomorrow's.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:45.330
God also tells us what the future holds.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.330
Knowledge like that can protect and unite us

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:50.330
and our families right now,

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:53.330
and can also direct us to future blessings.

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:02.740
The Bible is our record of God's superior wisdom.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:06.740
From the first talk on the convention program to the last,

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:08.740
the Bible was featured.

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:24.659
Is the source of the best teaching anyone can receive?

00:12:24.659 --> 00:12:29.659
Enhance Jehovah's instruction is divine teaching,

00:12:29.659 --> 00:12:36.659
and this is true in the sense that only Jehovah possesses absolute wisdom.

00:12:36.659 --> 00:12:39.659
Another triumph of divine teaching is that he gives those

00:12:39.659 --> 00:12:42.659
who accepted a real purpose in life.

00:12:42.659 --> 00:12:47.659
Divine teaching springs from Jehovah God,

00:12:47.659 --> 00:12:50.659
who is described, but I say,

00:12:50.659 --> 00:12:58.659
4610 as the one telling from the beginning, the final.

00:12:58.659 --> 00:13:03.659
And remember, the choice of these teachings you hear is manifested,

00:13:03.659 --> 00:13:10.659
not so much by what you say, but by your actions.

00:13:10.659 --> 00:13:14.659
To make sure all are unitedly instructed by Jehovah,

00:13:14.659 --> 00:13:18.659
selected talks at each location underlaven simultaneously

00:13:18.659 --> 00:13:21.659
in up to 16 languages.

00:13:36.659 --> 00:13:41.159
The differ around the world or not have a look.

00:13:41.159 --> 00:13:45.159
Divine teaching unites them with a worldwide brotherhood.

00:13:51.159 --> 00:14:18.669
Who are the speakers on the four-day program?

00:14:18.669 --> 00:14:26.259
Representatives from many of them more than 100 watched our branches,

00:14:26.259 --> 00:14:30.259
traveling ministers, and qualified witnesses from local congregations.

00:14:30.259 --> 00:14:42.480
The subjects covered range from Bible prophecy to how families can be happily united.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:49.480
Our spiritual health can be taken care of by submitting to healthful teachings.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:55.480
Practical counsel from the Bible is presented for young and old,

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:58.480
whether single or married.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:06.860
Two-to-life demonstrations, as well as discussions and interviews,

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:15.139
show how various ones are meeting the challenge of living as Christians in today's world.

00:15:15.139 --> 00:15:19.139
Experiences from the Daunted All Ministry also presented.

00:15:19.139 --> 00:15:24.139
I started pioneering in 1938 when I was 18 years old.

00:15:24.139 --> 00:15:39.720
Even in the face of stormy weather,

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:43.720
crowds remain and pay attention.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:16:03.090
Arranging for a series of international conventions requires careful planning,

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:05.090
Brooklyn, New York.

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:08.090
At the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:13.090
plans for the international conventions began years in advance.

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:17.090
Which sites would be the most desirable?

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:19.090
How many persons would they hold?

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:23.090
What about rooming availability for thousands of foreign delegates?

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:27.090
What would be the convention theme?

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:30.090
To coordinate with officials in each convention country,

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:33.090
committees of local witnesses are appointed.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:43.429
As convention dates approach, witnesses by the thousands volunteer their time and energy

00:16:43.429 --> 00:16:45.429
to prepare the stadiums.

00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:59.820
An official in Kiev said,

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:03.820
the stadium has not been cleaned this well for 13 years.

00:17:03.820 --> 00:18:27.250
In Kiev, 70 sisters worked over a two-week period,

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:31.250
making thousands of flowers by hand to decorate the stage.

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:43.779
A policeman they're exclaimed,

00:18:43.779 --> 00:18:44.779
what are people?

00:18:44.779 --> 00:18:46.779
It's like being in a new world.

00:18:46.779 --> 00:18:50.779
I simply cannot understand why you people were persecuted.

00:18:51.779 --> 00:19:13.339
As convention dates get closer,

00:19:13.339 --> 00:19:18.339
final construction, stage assembly and decorations are completed.

00:19:18.339 --> 00:19:38.119
In Kiev, witnesses from several Eastern European countries

00:19:38.119 --> 00:19:43.119
put their skills and energy into constructing 100 temporary toilets.

00:19:43.119 --> 00:20:15.589
Because of the intense sun in Santiago,

00:20:15.589 --> 00:20:20.589
local brothers designed, assembled and erected an enormous shade canopy.

00:20:23.539 --> 00:20:27.539
322,000 square feet of screen material was required,

00:20:27.539 --> 00:20:31.539
along with 15,000 feet of rope and cable.

00:20:31.539 --> 00:20:45.779
All this work is done in order to make the attending delegates more comfortable

00:20:45.779 --> 00:20:56.619
and must better able to take in divine teaching.

00:20:56.619 --> 00:21:01.619
13 tons of sound equipment arrived by truck from Germany to Moscow and Kiev.

00:21:01.619 --> 00:21:05.619
40 volunteers worked to install it.

00:21:06.619 --> 00:21:11.619
At Kiev, 350 loudspeakers and 12 miles of wiring are required

00:21:11.619 --> 00:21:16.619
to handle translation of talks into 16 different languages.

00:21:16.619 --> 00:21:20.619
The sound for each language is thus directed to each group of delegates.

00:21:35.619 --> 00:22:15.019
Most of the thousands of foreign delegates arrive by European.

00:22:15.019 --> 00:22:24.700
In Bogota, Colombia, 79 separate flights bring delegates from 31 countries.

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:27.700
Officials there issue special tourist visas to all delegates

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:30.700
and expedite their luggage through customs.

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:36.420
Jehovah's Witnesses are easily identified by their distinctive blue

00:22:36.420 --> 00:23:10.809
divine teaching badges.

00:23:10.809 --> 00:23:15.809
Volunteers at hospitality desks welcome and assist arriving delegates.

00:23:15.809 --> 00:23:28.549
Commercial tour companies arrange for transfers of passengers and luggage to hotels.

00:23:50.019 --> 00:23:54.019
Other forms of transportation are used by witnesses within each country

00:23:54.019 --> 00:24:01.359
for travel to the convention city.

00:24:01.359 --> 00:24:06.359
At the train station in Kiev, Ukrainian witnesses greet arriving delegates.

00:24:10.359 --> 00:24:19.000
In Colombia, some congregations charter buses

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
so that all can travel together.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:28.799
Where do you arriving delegates stay?

00:24:28.799 --> 00:24:32.799
Most are taken to hotels, pre-arranged by commercial tour companies.

00:24:32.799 --> 00:25:00.369
Most of the 50,000 witnesses coming to Kiev stay in hotels and private homes,

00:25:00.369 --> 00:25:04.369
but about 1,800 stay on six large boats.

00:25:04.369 --> 00:25:10.750
A housekeeper left a note for the witnesses.

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:11.750
It reads,

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:15.750
it seems to me that you've come from another planet.

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:18.750
You have so much harmony that you bring a blessing.

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:27.140
The arrival of delegates on the first morning of an international convention

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:30.140
of Jehovah's Witnesses is a happy occasion.

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:39.369
In Kiev, some 53,000 delegates use mass transit to arrive at the convention.

00:25:39.369 --> 00:25:49.160
In Santiago, local brothers come early to greet visitors from other lands.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:26:05.960
In Kiev, please provide an escort for 135 buses

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:08.960
transporting foreign delegates to and from the stadium.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:16.789
There is more than the abundance of spiritual food.

00:26:16.789 --> 00:26:20.789
Many hardworking volunteers prepare and distribute lunches.

00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:33.710
One newspaper correspondent commented,

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:38.710
noticeable that your convention is the considerable number of young people.

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:42.710
They're kind, good-looking and well-behaved.

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:44.710
How do you do it?

00:26:44.710 --> 00:27:04.910
A scripture that sees fulfillment during the lunch breaks is Psalm 133.1.

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:11.289
Look how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity.

00:27:11.289 --> 00:27:38.039
In Kiev, foreign delegates bring extra food and clothing

00:27:38.039 --> 00:27:41.039
to leave as gifts for the Ukrainian brothers,

00:27:41.039 --> 00:27:44.039
hard hit by difficult economic times.

00:27:44.039 --> 00:27:52.880
A highlight of conventions of Jehovah's Witnesses is the release of new publications.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:58.880
Tiny Bible study aids designed to increase our knowledge of God and His purposes.

00:28:02.599 --> 00:28:07.599
In this new brochure entitled The Purpose of Life.

00:28:07.599 --> 00:28:12.599
In Moscow and in Kiev, a new brochure entitled,

00:28:12.599 --> 00:28:14.599
what is the purpose of life?

00:28:14.599 --> 00:28:15.599
How can you find it?

00:28:15.599 --> 00:28:35.759
It's released in both the Russian and Ukrainian languages.

00:28:35.759 --> 00:28:40.759
In this new brochure entitled, what is the purpose of life?

00:28:40.759 --> 00:28:44.759
In Hong Kong, the new brochure is released in Chinese.

00:28:44.759 --> 00:28:54.859
In Manila, it is released in Tagalog.

00:28:57.859 --> 00:29:09.250
And they Tagalog languages.

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:14.250
For 1990, we got the video cassette Jehovah's Witnesses, the organization.

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:19.250
In Hong Kong, the video cassette Jehovah's Witnesses, the organization behind the name,

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:23.250
is released in Mandarin and in Cantonese.

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:26.250
This is one in Chinese.

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:33.490
This brings the total to 27 languages released for this particular video.

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:40.880
It is a pleasure to announce the release in the Russian language

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:45.880
of this fine publication My Book of Bible Story.

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.880
Children also vitally need divine teaching.

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:56.880
Men at Kiev receive a release of My Book of Bible Stories.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:07.390
He loves small children.

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:10.390
Look how Jesus took this small boy.

00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:13.390
The visible Jesus is a real son.

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:16.390
The visible Jesus is a real son.

00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:19.390
The men who watch this watch the rest of the Jesus.

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:23.390
And what is it now? They say Jesus. Let's find out.

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:37.900
Russian and Ukrainian Witnesses, no longer under ban,

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:40.900
will be assisted in public speaking by the release

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:43.900
Theocratic Ministry School God Book.

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:56.490
A big step in learning divine teaching has taken

00:30:56.490 --> 00:31:00.490
when people are able to read the Bible in their own language.

00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:05.490
We are pleased to announce that the Tagalog New World Translation

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:08.490
in Manila, Bible's containing the New World Translation

00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:10.490
of the Christian Greek Scriptures,

00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:15.490
are released in Subwana, Iloka and Tagala languages.

00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:20.430
The modern day history of the witnesses

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:24.430
is detailed in the new publication, Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:26.430
Proclamers of God's Kingdom.

00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:33.269
It is released in a total of 20 different languages

00:31:33.269 --> 00:31:37.269
with translation and publication underway for 13 more.

00:31:37.269 --> 00:31:56.119
In Johannesburg, Delhi gets out delighted to receive two releases

00:31:56.119 --> 00:31:58.119
in nine local languages.

00:31:58.119 --> 00:32:03.230
As Jesus himself stated at Matthew 5.3,

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:07.230
happy are those conscious of their spiritual need.

00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:38.809
Conventions also include dramas as a means of instruction.

00:32:39.809 --> 00:32:45.299
Two are presented on the four-day program.

00:32:45.299 --> 00:32:52.859
One drama was entitled, Do Not Be Misled or mock God.

00:32:52.859 --> 00:32:56.859
The other, youths who remember the creator now,

00:32:56.859 --> 00:33:00.859
shows the benefits of teaching a child godly wisdom.

00:33:15.859 --> 00:33:19.859
I have already wanted to use the New World Translation

00:33:19.859 --> 00:33:22.859
which you, me and Anna,

00:33:22.859 --> 00:33:24.859
Mariah Kwanza, Alyona Kanamu, Neurofiki,

00:33:24.859 --> 00:33:27.859
Sanana, Atalikokita, Basamu, Alpufunguam, Langu.

00:33:27.859 --> 00:33:30.859
Just look at me.

00:33:30.859 --> 00:33:34.859
I have served less than a month in my own means.

00:33:34.859 --> 00:33:36.859
Look at me.

00:33:36.859 --> 00:33:38.859
I have become a sign for less than a month,

00:33:38.859 --> 00:33:40.859
and I am talking to the rendering.

00:33:41.859 --> 00:33:43.859
Do you know me?

00:33:43.859 --> 00:33:46.859
This is asking Atas to give my life.

00:33:46.859 --> 00:33:50.869
Look at me.

00:33:50.869 --> 00:33:52.869
I have served less than a month in my own means.

00:33:52.869 --> 00:33:54.869
It means you have to give up.

00:33:54.869 --> 00:34:01.079
I don't know what to do with my own business.

00:34:18.059 --> 00:34:20.059
Foreign delegates have opportunities

00:34:20.059 --> 00:34:25.320
to visit sites of local interest.

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:28.320
Sites seeing by boat is popular in Kiev.

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:34.190
One tour guide said, usually when I lead a group,

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:38.190
its disunity becomes manifest as soon as it leaves the airport.

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:41.789
This has not been true of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:34:43.789 --> 00:34:48.789
In Johannesburg, many delegates tour the original site of a South African gold mine.

00:34:48.789 --> 00:35:17.510
What is a tour without shopping?

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:20.510
Delegates from the Hong Kong Convention visit China.

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:52.940
Delegates and Kenya keep their cameras busy while on safaris and nearby game-box.

00:36:51.550 --> 00:37:01.449
In many convention countries, delegates tour Watchtower branch facilities.

00:37:01.449 --> 00:37:04.849
The South Africa branch has a large translation team.

00:37:04.849 --> 00:37:18.829
They translate literature into 15 languages and print in 27.

00:37:18.829 --> 00:37:37.059
Toures also include branches in Hong Kong and Santiago, Chile.

00:37:37.059 --> 00:37:40.659
In Manila, some delegates arrive at the branch in Jeepneys

00:37:40.659 --> 00:37:56.829
and are welcomed with refreshments.

00:37:56.829 --> 00:38:02.230
The new branch in Colombia sits 9,000 feet up in the Andes Mountains.

00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:37.519
Over a two-day period, 6,700 visitors to the Convention and Bogota tour the complex.

00:38:37.519 --> 00:38:47.019
Baptism is one of the most exciting and significant parts of conventions.

00:38:47.019 --> 00:38:55.269
It is public evidence of the powerful effects of divine teaching.

00:38:55.269 --> 00:38:59.070
It is not a spur of the moment in emotional decision.

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:02.469
All candidates have studied the Bible at length with Jehovah's Witnesses

00:39:02.469 --> 00:39:04.869
and understand it well.

00:39:04.869 --> 00:39:08.869
They have gone over a series of Bible questions with congregation elders

00:39:08.869 --> 00:39:18.559
and made a prayerful resolve to serve God forever.

00:39:18.559 --> 00:39:23.760
Candidates stand before the assembled crowds and answer yes to two questions.

00:39:30.159 --> 00:39:32.760
On the basis of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ,

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:37.760
have you repented of your sins and dedicated yourself to Jehovah to do his will?

00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:04.260
Do you understand that your dedication and baptism identify you as one of Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:08.260
Do you remember the word Jesus Christ?

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:11.599
Yes.

00:40:11.599 --> 00:40:13.599
Is it the word Jesus Christ?

00:40:13.599 --> 00:40:14.599
Yes.

00:40:14.599 --> 00:40:16.599
Is it the word Jesus Christ?

00:40:16.599 --> 00:40:17.599
Yes.

00:40:17.599 --> 00:40:26.449
Is it the word Jesus Christ?

00:40:26.449 --> 00:40:28.449
You are allowed at firmet advances,

00:40:28.449 --> 00:41:04.739
indicate that you are ready and qualified for Christian baptism.

00:41:04.739 --> 00:41:07.739
The masses of newly baptized witnesses,

00:41:07.739 --> 00:41:10.739
remind us of the Apostle John's remarkable vision

00:41:10.739 --> 00:41:13.739
recorded in the 7th chapter of Revelation, verse 9.

00:41:13.739 --> 00:41:17.739
I saw and look, a great crowd which no man was able to number

00:41:17.739 --> 00:42:32.940
out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues.

00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:37.940
The baptism in Kiev is a high point of the divine teaching international conventions.

00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:41.940
The crowd continues to applaud during the two and a half hours

00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:50.980
it takes to baptize the 7,402, an all-time record

00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:57.889
for baptism of Jehovah's Witnesses at a single convention.

00:42:57.889 --> 00:43:01.889
The largest recorded mass baptism of true Christians ever,

00:43:01.889 --> 00:43:04.889
with 60 baptizers and six pools,

00:43:04.889 --> 00:44:12.510
the equivalent of a good-sized congregation is immersed every two minutes.

00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:15.510
Another unifying factor of international conventions

00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:30.420
is the opportunity to visit with witnesses from other lands.

00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:33.420
Seeing all nationalities united by divine teaching

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:37.929
reminds us of the words at Micah 212.

00:44:37.929 --> 00:44:41.929
In unity I shall set them, like a flock in the pen,

00:44:41.929 --> 00:45:01.150
they will be noisy with men.

00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:05.150
Unity means that all races live in harmony with one another.

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:10.150
The Apostle Peter stated at Acts 10-34 and 35,

00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:14.150
for a certainty I perceive that God is not partial,

00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:19.590
but in every nation the man that fears him and works righteousness

00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:22.590
is acceptable to him.

00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:26.590
A reporter for the Democratic Ukraine newspaper wrote,

00:45:27.590 --> 00:45:30.590
this convention showed that the achievement of peace

00:45:30.590 --> 00:45:33.590
and harmony among people of different nationalities

00:45:33.590 --> 00:45:41.059
and from various countries is rarely possible.

00:45:41.059 --> 00:45:44.059
Millions today bear living testimony

00:45:44.059 --> 00:45:46.059
to the power of God's Word,

00:45:46.059 --> 00:45:58.820
to conquer even racial and ethnic prejudice.

00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:01.820
A united brotherhood is unique in the strife torn world.

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:05.820
Jesus described an identifying mark of his true followers,

00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:08.820
from 1335.

00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:11.820
By this all will know that you are my disciples

00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:14.820
if you have loved among yourselves.

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:22.650
What accounts for such unity?

00:46:22.650 --> 00:46:25.650
People of every background are coming to know Jehovah

00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:28.650
as the only true God and are changing their lives

00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:38.530
to conform with his righteous ways.

00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:42.530
The evening Kiev newspaper reported,

00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:44.530
Jehovah's Witnesses are united,

00:46:44.530 --> 00:46:47.530
not only by blue badges with divine teaching written on them,

00:46:47.530 --> 00:46:49.530
but by true faith.

00:46:49.530 --> 00:47:07.420
The love among Jehovah's Witnesses forms a perfect bond of union

00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:10.420
that also extends to others around the globe.

00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:19.420
Jesus prophesied at Acts 1-8,

00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:24.420
you will be witnesses of me to the most distant part of the earth.

00:47:30.719 --> 00:47:32.719
And they are mine.

00:47:40.719 --> 00:47:44.719
Millions of Jehovah's Witnesses living in 231 countries

00:47:44.719 --> 00:47:47.719
are united in telling their neighbors about God's Kingdom,

00:47:47.719 --> 00:47:51.719
using more than 200 different languages to do so.

00:47:55.719 --> 00:47:56.719
Which reads,

00:47:56.719 --> 00:47:59.719
but the meek ones themselves will persist in earth.

00:47:59.719 --> 00:48:02.719
They devote more than one billion hours a year

00:48:02.719 --> 00:48:05.719
to spreading the good news to their neighbors.

00:48:05.719 --> 00:48:16.719
It is faith in Jehovah and his word the Bible

00:48:16.719 --> 00:48:20.719
that leads to such remarkable unity of purpose.

00:48:27.719 --> 00:48:28.719
Uh-huh.

00:48:36.719 --> 00:48:41.719
The wong strengthen the unity by studying the new purpose of life brochures of family

00:48:41.719 --> 00:48:43.719
and by applying what they learn.

00:48:46.719 --> 00:48:49.719
The entire Pentor family is now baptized

00:48:49.719 --> 00:48:51.719
and united in Jehovah's Service.

00:48:56.719 --> 00:48:59.719
I would like you to be with the artist.

00:48:59.719 --> 00:49:01.719
Yes, I would like to say more to others.

00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:56.780
The mountains and the hills themselves will become cheerful before you.

00:50:56.780 --> 00:51:00.780
And the very trees of the field will all clap their hands.

00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:12.500
A happy, united human family is not a dream.

00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:22.579
An elderly witness at the Kiev Convention sums it up this way.

00:51:22.579 --> 00:51:28.579
We are all one, united through the divine teaching of Jehovah God.
