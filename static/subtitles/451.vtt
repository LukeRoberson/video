00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:03.859
Our text comments contain this thought.

00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:05.339
If you look about halfway down,

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:06.900
there's a sentence that says,

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.900
feeling tender compassion will move us to acts of kindness.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.820
It's interesting the Bible in different places

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.460
links those two qualities together.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.260
For example, Ephesians 432 states become kind

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.300
to one another, tenderly compassionate.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.780
Insight on the Scriptures defines compassion this way.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.899
It's a sympathetic awareness

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.219
of another suffering or adversity

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.820
coupled with a desire to alleviate it.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.299
So we have the awareness,

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:42.020
we have the feeling along with that desire to act kindly.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.579
But sadly, as the watchtower once mentioned,

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.179
the moral climate of our time has killed compassion

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:52.539
in the hearts of so many.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.979
A watching the world item highlighted that

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:58.020
some years ago in the awake,

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.740
in Italy, a six-year-old girl and her father

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.859
were driving to the beach.

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:04.659
As they entered a tunnel,

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.219
the father, who was only in his thirties,

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:08.900
suddenly suffered a heart attack.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.379
Before he died,

00:01:11.379 --> 00:01:13.859
he told his little girl to find her way home.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.980
She struggled out of the tunnel,

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.379
repeatedly blown over by gusts of wind

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:22.019
from cars that zip by without slowing.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.939
Scratched, bleeding, and in tears,

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.540
she walked along the highway for half an hour,

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.859
ignored by hundreds of passing cars filled with vacationers,

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:35.980
until finally one car stopped to help.

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:39.019
Newspaper editorials around the country

00:01:39.019 --> 00:01:40.819
asked searching questions,

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:42.739
such as whether the country's affluence

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:46.379
had made it lose some of the warmth and compassion

00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:48.819
for which did Longbin famous.

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:50.900
One newspaper mentioned,

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.420
along the happy road of vacation,

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.340
there were no scheduled stops for attending

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.099
to the pain of others.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.700
Well, that account sadly illustrates the world

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.659
that we live in.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.299
Let's talk a little bit more about this quality of compassion.

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.979
We'll consider when compassion should not be shown.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.860
We'll look at an example of Jehovah's compassion,

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.780
and then we'll consider in some practical ways

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.340
that we can show compassion.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.259
First, there are times when compassion should not be shown.

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:27.219
For example, if someone deliberately persists in sin,

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:28.979
it would be wrong to feel that we should

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:32.219
compassionately shield them from discipline.

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:35.020
See, that would be misplaced compassion.

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:37.900
Let's notice an example in ancient Israel.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.620
Please turn with me to Deuteronomy chapter 13.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.620
Deuteronomy 13, if you look in verse six,

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.379
the Israelites were commanded that if a brother, child,

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:49.860
well, you notice there are some expressions

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.539
such as cherished wife or closest companion.

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:56.500
If any of those were to urge a person

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.900
to serve other gods, notice the instruction in verse eight,

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.500
you must not give in to him or listen to him,

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.500
nor should you show pity or feel compassion or protect him.

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:13.620
Instead, you should kill him without fail.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.419
Now, why was that so important?

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:17.500
Why was it important not to show compassion?

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:19.060
Well, verse 11,

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.300
then all Israel will hear and become afraid

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.300
and they will never again do anything bad like this among you.

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:30.659
So it was for a protection for the nation.

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:33.580
If someone tried to turn an Israelite from serving Jehovah,

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.979
that was not the time to show compassion.

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:39.419
Yielding to pressure to show compassion

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:43.860
when it's contrary to God's will can have serious consequences.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.659
So we certainly need to avoid misplaced compassion.

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.219
Now let's consider an example of Jehovah's compassion.

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:54.539
Turn with me to Exodus chapter three.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.300
Exodus chapter three,

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.060
while tending to his father-in-law's sheep,

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.460
Moses saw something he'd never seen before.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.020
And I dare say none of us have ever seen it either.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.539
Moses saw a thorn bush on fire, but it wasn't being consumed.

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:13.259
So Moses decided to go and investigate.

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:15.500
By means of an angel, Jehovah spoke to Moses

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.660
from the midst of the fire and noticed what he said in verse five.

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:21.540
Do not come any near.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.899
Remove your sandals from your feet

00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:27.540
because the place where you are standing is holy ground.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.980
So just think because the holy God was present

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.660
representatively, the ground itself became holy.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:37.660
Now keep that thought in mind.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.300
We're gonna come back to it.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.100
Let's focus now on Jehovah's compassion

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.500
for his people who were suffering in Egypt.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.259
Notice verse seven.

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:46.980
Jehovah added,

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.699
I have certainly seen the affliction of my people

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:52.860
who are in Egypt and I have heard their outcry

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.259
because of those who forced them to work.

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:58.300
I well know the pains they suffer.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.899
So Jehovah wasn't blind to the misery of his people.

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:05.620
He wasn't deaf to their cries for help.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.500
Their anguish became his own.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.579
Did you notice the expression at the end of the verse?

00:05:10.579 --> 00:05:13.540
I well know the pains they suffer.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.220
Regarding the phrase, I well know one reference work states,

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.220
the expression implies personal feeling, tenderness and compassion.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.579
So Jehovah's words here reveal a deeply concerned,

00:05:27.579 --> 00:05:30.339
caring and compassionate God.

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:31.620
And what would Jehovah do?

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.819
Would he act kindly on that compassion?

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:36.300
Well, we know he was going to,

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:37.899
verse 10 in part,

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:39.459
Jehovah commissioned Moses,

00:05:39.459 --> 00:05:42.100
bring my people out of Egypt.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.899
You know, this account should be encouraging to us.

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:49.500
We can be sure that Jehovah sees our adversities.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.019
He hears our cries for help.

00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:55.100
He knows the pain that we suffer at times.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.379
But Jehovah just doesn't feel compassion for us.

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:01.220
Now he's moved to act kindly.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.060
Why?

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.620
First Peter 5.7.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.740
He cares for each one of us.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.980
God's compassion also gives us reason for hope.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.259
One sister who struggled with depression and discouragement

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:16.420
found comfort in this account about Moses and the Thornbush.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.500
You remember the holy ground that we read about in verse 5?

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.500
The sister said,

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.259
if Jehovah can make even the dirt holy,

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:27.540
then maybe there's a little hope for me.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.899
See, she benefited from Jehovah's compassion.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.300
Well, so far we've seen the need to avoid misplace compassion.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.579
We've considered Jehovah's example

00:06:37.579 --> 00:06:39.540
of not only feeling compassion,

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.300
but acting kindly on it.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.660
How can we imitate him?

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:46.339
One quality that can help is love,

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:48.860
unselfish love of neighbor.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.300
Let's consider two practical ways that can help us,

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.220
that we can show this type of compassion.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.339
First, compassion will help us to avoid reacting harshly

00:06:59.339 --> 00:07:00.980
when others make mistakes.

00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:04.459
Remember earlier we quoted Ephesians 432,

00:07:04.459 --> 00:07:06.819
linking kindness and compassion.

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:09.060
Well, let's turn to the verse just previous.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.339
Ephesians 4, turn and let's read verse 31.

00:07:12.339 --> 00:07:14.699
Ephesians 431, keep that thought in mind.

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:18.139
Compassion will help us to avoid reacting harshly

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:20.379
when others make mistakes.

00:07:20.379 --> 00:07:23.579
Verse 31, put away from yourselves every kind of malicious

00:07:23.579 --> 00:07:28.579
bitterness, anger, wrath, screaming and abuse of speech

00:07:28.899 --> 00:07:31.180
as well as everything injurious.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:32.660
And then verse 32 says,

00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:35.019
But there's the connector,

00:07:35.019 --> 00:07:40.019
but become kind to one another, tenderly compassionate.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.699
So whether at home, in the congregation,

00:07:43.699 --> 00:07:46.740
at Bethel on construction sites, wherever we may be,

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.339
let's allow love, this unselfish love of neighbor

00:07:50.339 --> 00:07:52.500
to cause us to show compassion

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.980
and avoid reacting harshly when others make mistakes.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.500
A second way that love can help us to be compassionate

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:01.699
is that it will help us to avoid

00:08:01.699 --> 00:08:04.819
the imperfect tendency to abuse power.

00:08:06.019 --> 00:08:07.860
Colossians 312 states,

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:11.540
clothe yourselves with the tender affections of compassion,

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.540
kindness, they're the two linked together again,

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:18.180
and then the verse adds humility or lowliness of mind.

00:08:19.019 --> 00:08:21.699
The watchtower once made this point about that verse.

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.540
Lowliness of mind enables us to put ourselves

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:29.259
in the position of those under our supervision.

00:08:30.139 --> 00:08:33.059
To be compassionate involves being humble

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:36.740
and reasonable rather than hard to please.

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:39.179
Efficiency should not be an excuse

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:43.019
for treating people as mere parts of a machine.

00:08:43.019 --> 00:08:44.419
Good points to keep in mind.

00:08:45.659 --> 00:08:49.700
So those are two ways that love can help us to be compassionate,

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.899
avoid reacting harshly when others make mistakes

00:08:52.899 --> 00:08:55.860
and avoid the imperfect tendency to abuse power.

00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:00.340
So while the moral climate has killed compassion

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.379
in the hearts of so many today,

00:09:02.379 --> 00:09:05.019
we want to be known for our compassion.

00:09:05.899 --> 00:09:09.580
Of course, never would we want to display misplaced compassion

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.659
if someone deliberately persists in sin.

00:09:12.659 --> 00:09:15.139
Rather, we want to imitate Jehovah

00:09:15.139 --> 00:09:20.179
and kindly act on our feelings of compassion for those in need.

00:09:20.179 --> 00:09:21.580
So as we go about our day,

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.980
let's look for ways that we can heed the admonition

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.860
there at Ephesians 432,

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:30.360
become kind to one another, tenderly compassionate.
