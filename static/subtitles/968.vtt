00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.910
I am so sorry.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.390
It's my fault, please, forgive me.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.669
No matter how we phrase it, it can be difficult to apologize.

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:16.070
Why is that so challenging?

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.910
There are many reasons.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.589
We may fear confrontation, lame or rejection.

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:25.190
Perhaps we feel embarrassed and we're too proud to apologize.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.390
We may reason, apologizing will not undo the blunder I've already made.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.750
And it may even be that we are angry.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:42.689
This is such a matter of concern that in July 2000, the California State Legislature in

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:48.689
the United States passed a bill designed to relieve people of liability if they express

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:52.869
sympathy to an individual who was injured in an accident in which they themselves were

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:54.750
involved.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.469
It was noted that people often hesitate to extend an apology out of concern that it could

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.829
be construed in court as an admission of guilt.

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:12.030
The Bible provides an account of a faithful servant, the Apostle Paul, who was a good example

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.670
of one who apologized.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.750
The account is in the Book of Acts, chapter 23.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:26.629
The setting, a Roman military officer wanted to know why Paul was being accused by the Jews.

00:01:26.629 --> 00:01:33.909
So he brought Paul to the Jewish chief priests and commanded the Sanhedrin, the high court,

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:35.709
to assemble.

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:42.030
As we read Acts chapter 23 verses 1 through 5 together, we can't help but be impressed

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.989
by Paul's boldness as he stands for what is right.

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:51.950
But at the same time, please take note of his humility.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.950
Looking intently at the Sanhedrin, Paul said,

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:04.950
Men, brothers, I have behaved before God with a perfectly clear conscience down to this day.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.949
At this, the high priest and an I has ordered those standing by him to strike him on the mouth.

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.949
Then Paul said to him,

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:16.949
God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall.

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:25.949
Do you sit to judge me according to the law and at the same time violate the law by commanding me to be struck?

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:27.949
Those standing by said,

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:32.949
Are you insulting the high priest of God?

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:34.949
And Paul said,

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:38.949
Brothers, I did not know he was high priest.

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:43.949
For it is written, you must not speak injuriously of a ruler of your people.

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:49.300
Paul immediately admitted his heir.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.300
What he had said, that the one appointed his judge,

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.300
should not resort to violence, was right.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.300
Yet he apologized.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:08.300
In the following dramatization, we will see an older sister applying the inspired words of Titus chapter 2 verses 3 through 5

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.300
in order to advise younger sisters to be sound in mind.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:21.300
We will also observe how one of the younger sisters avoids further problems and pursues peace by humbly apologizing.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:33.189
I don't know how this happened.

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:38.729
But Haley, I'm sorry.

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:41.729
It hurts me to see you so upset.

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:58.860
First, what you heard was not what I said.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.520
I thought that's how you felt.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.520
And even if I got that part wrong, all this drama...

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.569
Let's stop.

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.569
Come on, girls.

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:25.209
Haley, come closer.

00:04:25.209 --> 00:04:30.209
Love is patient and kind.

00:04:30.209 --> 00:04:38.230
It's not jealous.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:48.449
It doesn't become provoked even when things become difficult.

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:53.329
So what are we going to do?

00:04:53.329 --> 00:05:02.589
I just thought they've been...

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:12.889
No, I'm sorry, Haley.

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:13.889
I'm sorry.

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:20.220
I shouldn't have judged you so harshly.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:26.829
I shouldn't have judged you at all.

00:05:26.829 --> 00:05:33.180
And I'm sorry for dragging you into this, but twisting what you said.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.180
It's okay. Things happen.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.180
I've been a person.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:49.790
I should never have spoken that way to you, Celia.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:06:04.819
To either of you, I'm tonight.

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:10.529
I'll call you tomorrow.

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:22.060
The older sister apologized even though she was not in the wrong.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.060
She also urged the two younger sisters to make peace.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:32.060
It takes courage, humility, and determination to apologize.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:39.060
It's interesting to note what stated at Philippians chapter 2 and verse 3.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:46.170
Do nothing out of contentiousness or out of egotism.

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:53.170
But with humility, consider others superior to you.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:59.170
That means our determined effort is not to win an argument which could be contentious.

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:03.170
Nor do we want to start a discussion with the primary thought being that

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:05.170
we are in the right.

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:10.170
That means that we are self-concerned or egotistical.

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:14.170
Rather, in harmony with the principle of that scripture,

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:18.170
we want to act with humility.

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:21.170
Our aim should be to pursue peace.

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:28.170
Even if we think the other person is being unreasonable, we apologize.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:31.170
Why is it so important to do so?

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:36.170
Because that is what makes our worship to Jehovah acceptable.

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:44.170
At Matthew chapter 5 verses 23 and 24, Jesus makes it very clear.

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:51.889
If then, you are bringing your gift to the older.

00:07:51.889 --> 00:07:55.889
And there you remember that your brother has something against you.

00:07:55.889 --> 00:08:01.889
Leave your gift there in front of the older and go away.

00:08:01.889 --> 00:08:05.889
First, make your peace with your brother.

00:08:05.889 --> 00:08:10.889
And then come back and offer your gift.

00:08:10.889 --> 00:08:14.889
One Bible scholar describes the scene this way.

00:08:14.889 --> 00:08:19.459
The worshipper has entered the temple.

00:08:19.459 --> 00:08:24.459
He has passed through its series of courts, the court of the Gentiles,

00:08:24.459 --> 00:08:27.459
the court of the women, the court of the men.

00:08:27.459 --> 00:08:31.459
Beyond that, there lay the court of the priests,

00:08:31.459 --> 00:08:34.460
into which the laymen could not go.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.460
The worshipper is standing at the rail,

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:41.460
ready to hand over his living animal to the priest.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.460
At that critical moment,

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:49.700
the worshipper remembers that his brother has something against him.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.700
What is he to do?

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:56.700
Leave your gift there in front of the altar, Jesus explains.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.700
And go away.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:04.700
What does Jesus say is more important in offering up a sacrifice?

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:08.700
First, make peace with your brother.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:14.700
Then, when you have come back, offer up your gift.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:20.700
The expression rendered make your peace means to reconcile.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:24.700
Jesus' words teach a crucial lesson.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:29.700
Reconciliation or peace comes before sacrifice.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.700
The way we treat fellow worshippers

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:37.700
has a direct bearing on our relationship with God.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.700
1 John 4 verse 20 pointedly says,

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:44.700
for the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:49.700
cannot love God whom he has not seen.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.700
If we find ourselves in a situation

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.700
when we have offended a fellow worshipper,

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.700
we want to apply Jesus' counsel.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:01.700
We want to take the initiative to approach our brother or sister.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.700
We may need to acknowledge their hurt feelings.

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.700
We may also need to ask,

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:09.700
what can I do to make amends?

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:13.700
Often, a sincere apology is all that is needed.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:20.019
Although our worship today no longer includes animal sacrifices,

00:10:20.019 --> 00:10:25.019
what Jesus was teaching emphasizes that there is a connection

00:10:25.019 --> 00:10:31.019
between peace with our brother and acceptable worship to God.

00:10:31.019 --> 00:10:34.019
When two humans are at odds,

00:10:34.019 --> 00:10:37.019
there may be a measure of blame on both sides,

00:10:37.019 --> 00:10:40.019
since both are imperfect and prone to error.

00:10:40.019 --> 00:10:44.019
This usually calls for mutual concessions.

00:10:44.019 --> 00:10:48.019
Even if only the one apologizing is right.

00:10:48.019 --> 00:10:52.019
The issue is not so much who is right and who is wrong,

00:10:52.019 --> 00:10:57.019
but who will take the initiative to make peace?

00:10:57.019 --> 00:11:00.019
When the Apostle Paul heard that the Christians in Corinth

00:11:00.019 --> 00:11:04.019
were taking fellow servants of God to secular courts

00:11:04.019 --> 00:11:06.019
over personal differences,

00:11:06.019 --> 00:11:08.019
he said,

00:11:08.019 --> 00:11:11.019
why do you not rather let yourself be wrong?

00:11:11.019 --> 00:11:15.019
Why do you not rather let yourself be defrauded?

00:11:15.019 --> 00:11:18.360
The principle is clear.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:22.360
Peace among fellow believers is more important than proving

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:26.360
who is right and who is wrong.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:30.360
Keeping this in mind makes it easier to apologize for wrong

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.360
that someone thinks we have committed against him or her.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:39.360
A heart-felt apology can open the way to a constructive conversation.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:44.360
It can minimize problems and restore peace.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:49.830
Brother Lynette Myers, a helper to the writing committee,

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:52.830
will now present the next talk of this symposium.

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:57.830
Seek peace and pursue it by forgiving freely.
