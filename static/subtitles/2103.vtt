00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:08.880
On December 12, 2014, the Rostov Regional Court ruled on appeal of the criminal case of

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.160
16 of Jehovah's Witnesses in Tagunrog.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.600
The witnesses hoped that the appeal court would end the unjust prosecution and acquit them

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.199
of all charges.

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.800
Instead, the judge ordered a new trial.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.359
The court ordered the criminal case to be done by the court to rule the case of the murder of the

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.000
criminal case of the criminal case of the criminal case of the criminal case of the criminal case of the criminal case of the criminal case.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.439
The point in this question is not presented.

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:40.840
All of the time, in the case, you can tell the court of the legal witness of the Tagunrog in Tagunrog.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.679
And the Rostov Regional Court did not give a answer to this question.

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:49.799
He said that this answer will be decided by the new case of the Tagunrog.

00:00:49.799 --> 00:01:05.840
The initial trial in the Taginrog city court began over two years ago.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.959
The retrial began in the same court in January 2015.

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:13.079
Jehovah's Witnesses expected a decision in June.

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:18.040
But the judge postponed ruling on the case until some time later in 2015.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.519
The lengthy legal proceedings have, of course, taken their toll on the accused.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.519
The judge was obliged to conduct his time in court proceedings.

00:01:52.519 --> 00:02:00.519
In October 2015, I had no work left, because the workers didn't manage my part of the court.

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:06.280
Therefore, he said that at the same time, either you go to work or you go to the court.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.879
So, of course, I was forced to write a statement about my own desire to be elected.

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:18.520
My mother is the third group, and we live with her on a small scale.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.680
It's about 6000 rubles.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:28.680
And, of course, I wanted to show a normal material idea, but I couldn't do it physically, so I'm at the same time.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.159
The criminal trial is particularly difficult for the Tetsuk family,

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:38.039
because the authorities have criminally charged four members of the same family.

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:42.919
The judge asked me to take my son and daughter.

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:47.479
I was sentenced to three years in the Soviet Union.

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:51.800
And today, I have to go through all this again.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.439
In the whole world, I began to suffer with health.

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.400
I've been in hospital twice already.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.159
And what else can I do for five years?

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:05.639
My age is already too high.

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:08.520
We live with the husband, for our daughter, Snijana.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.080
She is very worried.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.840
She understands that her parents can recognize her new ones.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.960
And she also worries about her grandfather, who threatens the real trial of five-year-old prison.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.960
I feel it clear.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:29.479
Because my father, in the Soviet Union, had a trial of prison.

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:32.599
The fact that he refused his faith.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.520
And I don't understand why our modern Russia is repeating the same thing.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:45.719
Last year, the Taginrog city court convicted seven of the sixteen accused for so-called extremist activity.

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:51.800
The judge heavily fined all seven and sentenced four of them to imprisonment of up to five and a half years.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.960
But the decision was reversed.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.479
The judge acquitted the other nine witnesses on technical grounds,

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:01.800
but nevertheless held that they had engaged in extremist activity.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:12.280
It is interesting that the situation with the liquidation of the local religious organization of the Taginrog city was very similar to the one that was in Moscow in 2004.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:21.800
Then the European Court of Human Rights decided that the liquidation of the juridical street of the Taginrog city was illegal.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:30.040
The government recently registered the local religious organization of the Taginrog city in Moscow and paid compensation.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.399
But the fact of the Taginrog city has gone on for a long time.

00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:39.240
The authorities are using the threat of a foreign exchange as a way to update the victims of the illegal.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:48.199
The events that happen in recent times are the fact that the government of the Russian Federation has significantly strengthened its pressure on the victims of the illegal.

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:54.279
Russia is the only country in the world that has blocked the official website of the organization.

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:57.319
Our religious literature has been established.

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:00.839
We cannot even enter the Bible.

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:06.519
In the Taginrog city, in Samaria and Minsk, our local religious organization is prohibited.

00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:11.079
My personal belief in the Taginrog city is very proud of me.

00:05:11.079 --> 00:05:16.920
When I was four years old, my family was sent to Ukraine in Siberia, only for me,

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.160
that my parents were not allowed to live here. I was born in the village.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.680
Now, 16 people are not allowed to live here.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.480
People in the modern Russia will be sent to the prison only for the fact that they believe in God.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:35.720
Or they will always be protected by the right to the freedom of faith, guaranteed by the Constitution of Russia.
