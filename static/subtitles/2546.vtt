00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:11.070
Sometimes I get words mixed up and backwards, so it could be kind of challenging, so do I like reading?

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.070
Not really.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.070
I don't know. I find books not interested in boring.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.070
You know, just get completely distracted.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.070
I have to mentally prepare myself to read, because there's so many other things you could be doing.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:30.829
I don't enjoy reading, but I do like reading the Bible.

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:32.829
For me, it's more than a book.

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:38.390
It's definitely worth it.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.390
Some people may say it's not relevant for today, but when you look into it,

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.390
there's things you can learn from all the time.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.390
It's helped me to think before and speak.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.390
I find that I'm actually more concerned with other people,

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.390
they're well-being, how they're doing, and looking out for them.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.390
I think Bible readings made me a better person.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.390
It gives me a little push for the day.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.390
My favorite book in the Bible would probably be The Psalms, because it's easy for me to understand,

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.390
and it's really interesting to me.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.390
For young people, they can go through JW.org and get the Bible several different copies of the Bible right there.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.390
We'll type in that certain scripture, and there'll be articles about it.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:27.390
Another thing I'm loving is the new videos, an introduction to this book of the Bible.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.390
It just takes two or three minutes, and you can understand what you're about to read that book,

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.390
and that makes a huge difference.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.390
I go by topics or what interests me.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.390
I look for something that's interesting, that touches me directly,

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.390
just becomes an enjoyable process.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.390
It's very, very relevant, and it's very important,

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.390
and you can find happiness.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.390
I mean, it doesn't want that.
