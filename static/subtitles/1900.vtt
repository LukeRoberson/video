WEBVTT

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:03.970
Welcome.

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.209
We have many updates to share.

00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:13.970
Of course, the world's attention has been fixed on events in Russia and Ukraine.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.649
As Jehovah's people, we are not surprised by such events.

00:00:18.649 --> 00:00:26.190
We are well aware that Russia and its allies feel the role described in Daniel 11 as the

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.469
King of the North.

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:36.109
When the governing body first made this identification at the annual meeting in 2018, we mentioned

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:42.109
that the King of the North had already taken possession of Crimea.

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:48.750
When reading Daniel 11, it's not surprising to see that the King of the North is interested

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.109
in other territories.

00:00:51.109 --> 00:01:00.070
Certainly, this is the time to keep on the watch continually and to maintain our Christian

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.390
neutrality.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:11.230
As of February 28, we have no deaths, but one reported injury among our brothers in Ukraine.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.469
Dozens of their homes have been damaged.

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:18.709
Thousands of our brothers have fled areas of military conflict.

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:25.790
We are keeping you dear brothers and sisters in Ukraine and Russia in our prayers.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.689
At the same time, we are doing everything possible to be sure that you will have the needed

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:37.790
spiritual food as well as the necessities of life.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.549
With regard to legal matters, during the week of February 21, we had three significant

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.670
court decisions.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:55.569
On February 22, a court in Ust-Abakan ruled to grant parole and release to 70-year-old

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:59.030
Valentina Baranovskaja.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.870
Sister Baranovskaja has been in prison for the past 12 months.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.949
The prosecutor has until March 4 to appeal.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:15.509
If there is no appeal, then she could be released as early as March 5.

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:21.909
Please keep dear Sister Baranovskaja in your prayers.

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:29.430
On February 22, 2022, the European Court of Human Rights issued two significant judgments

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.590
concerning our brothers in Russia.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:41.789
The cases involved searches and police detention affecting various brothers from 2010 to 2012.

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:48.150
The court ruled in our favor and awarded damages to the 15 brothers and sisters who were

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.949
involved in these cases.

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:59.189
In total, the government of Russia will be required to pay nearly 100,000 euros.

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:06.270
The court noted that the public ministry of Jehovah's Witnesses is a fundamental right

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.710
that a public authority should not interfere with.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:17.550
In many countries, the number of COVID-19 cases is dropping.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.270
Some governments are starting to relax or eliminate various restrictions.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:31.909
We hope that conditions will allow us to resume more of our theocratic activities in person.

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:36.270
Yet we want to maintain our cautious approach.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:42.789
The governing body has directed branch committees to monitor the situation in each part of their

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:45.110
branch territory.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:52.669
Each branch committee may initiate or expand the pilot program for in-person meetings

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:56.509
when it can be done safely.

00:03:56.509 --> 00:04:04.349
Will it be possible to hold an in-person memorial for your congregation this year?

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:07.310
Only time will tell.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:15.469
In any case, this may be a good time for all of us to consider how we view our congregation

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:17.149
meetings.

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:23.310
If we can return to the Kingdom Hall, will we be ready to do so?

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.110
Think about how we reason with our Bible students on the importance of attending meetings

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.629
in less than 10 of the enjoy life forever book.

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:36.029
There it says,

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:40.509
Effort is required to attend meetings.

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:43.670
Consider the example of Jesus' family.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:52.430
To attend a yearly event, they had to walk some 60 miles or 100 kilometers through mountainous

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.870
terrain from Nazareth to Jerusalem.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.709
Then, the book asks this question,

00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:05.430
Why might you have to put forth effort to attend meetings?

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.389
Note out that soul-searching question has prompted some Bible students to begin to attend

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:13.069
meetings.

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:18.149
But maybe that's a question that we'll all have to think about.

00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:22.949
Going back to in-person meetings, we'll take some effort on our part.

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:29.550
But of course, we have to think about the blessings that come from in-person association

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.269
with our brothers and sisters.

00:05:32.269 --> 00:05:39.389
We can just imagine how much Joseph and Mary and their children enjoyed being in person

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:45.990
in Jerusalem when the city was filled with fellow worshippers of Jehovah.

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:53.870
Note out the joy from being there helped Joseph and Mary realize that it was truly worth

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.670
the effort.

00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:02.149
Likewise, our joy in being at the kingdom hall with our dear brothers and sisters will

00:06:02.149 --> 00:06:07.990
far outweigh any initial inconvenience.

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:13.829
Until we can return to the kingdom hall, we appreciate the fine effort that you dear

00:06:13.829 --> 00:06:18.389
brothers and sisters make to attend the meetings on Zoom.

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:25.269
By connecting early and staying after, we have more opportunities to do what's mentioned

00:06:25.269 --> 00:06:30.709
at Hebrews chapter 10 verses 24 and 25.

00:06:30.709 --> 00:06:37.949
And let us consider one another so as to incite to love and find works not for saking

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:44.670
our meeting together as some have the custom, but encouraging one another and all the more

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.910
so as you see the day drawing near.

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:55.870
We can experience the joy of giving as we actively encourage our brothers and sisters

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:00.910
inciting them to love and find works.

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:05.389
Of course, why do we put forth all of this effort?

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:13.310
Why do we work so hard to maintain our own spirituality and encourage others?

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:19.230
Because we want to keep our relationship with Jehovah strong.

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:28.310
And at the same time, take our stand against our great adversary, Satan the devil.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:34.069
Remember the warning recorded at 1 Peter chapter 5 verse 8.

00:07:34.069 --> 00:07:39.870
Where we read, keep your senses, be watchful.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:48.389
Your adversary, the devil walks about like a roaring lion seeking to devour someone.

00:07:48.389 --> 00:07:56.550
While the devil doesn't cause all our problems, he's always looking for a way to use them.

00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:04.310
He would love to use the stress and isolation of the pandemic to weaken our faith or to

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:08.670
sidetrack us with his propaganda.

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:10.870
What can help us?

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:14.509
Note what stated in verse 9.

00:08:14.509 --> 00:08:23.069
But take your stand against him, firm in the faith, knowing that the same kind of sufferings

00:08:23.069 --> 00:08:30.959
are being experienced by the entire association of your brothers in the world.

00:08:30.959 --> 00:08:38.039
Simply put, all of Jehovah's people are facing the same attack.

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:45.039
Although our challenges may be different, no matter where we live on this earth, we are

00:08:45.039 --> 00:08:47.480
under attack.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:54.080
But when we meditate on what our brothers and sisters in other places are dealing with,

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:58.399
it can help us to see our challenges differently.

00:08:58.399 --> 00:09:07.360
For example, think about our brothers and sisters facing natural disasters and persecution.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:15.799
So far this service here, our brothers have been affected by over 120 disasters, consider

00:09:15.799 --> 00:09:18.200
a few examples.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:25.519
In December, typhoon rye, locally known as Odette, devastated the Philippines.

00:09:25.519 --> 00:09:34.759
Sadly, four publishers died, a dozen were injured, and over 2,000 were displaced.

00:09:34.759 --> 00:09:44.720
And can you imagine, over 1,700 of our brothers' homes were damaged or destroyed?

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:51.399
In January, tropical storm Anna struck southeastern Africa.

00:09:51.399 --> 00:09:56.399
Sadly, one brother lost his wife and two children.

00:09:56.399 --> 00:09:59.519
Three brothers and a child were injured.

00:09:59.519 --> 00:10:09.159
Over 2,000 were displaced, and over 400 of our brothers' homes were damaged or destroyed.

00:10:09.159 --> 00:10:15.879
And on February 15, heavy rainstorms and mudslides hit Brazil.

00:10:15.879 --> 00:10:23.480
Unfortunately, one of our brothers and his two-year-old son were swept away by a mudslide.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:31.480
The father survived, despite serious injuries, but tragically his son died.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:35.080
Sadly, another brother also died.

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:41.919
We continue to pray for all who have lost loved ones or who have been affected by these

00:10:41.919 --> 00:10:44.840
recent disasters.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:51.840
In addition to natural disasters, our brothers also faced civil unrest.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:57.960
In the Democratic Republic of Congo, many of our brothers and sisters in several regions

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:01.799
have had to flee their villages and fields.

00:11:01.799 --> 00:11:09.480
Except with Jehovah's help, we've been able to provide over 81 tons of food to assist

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.320
more than 19,600 people.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:21.399
We deeply appreciate your support of our brothers and sisters who are facing disasters.

00:11:21.399 --> 00:11:28.120
Your prayers and generous donations are having a tremendous impact.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.519
Thank you.

00:11:30.519 --> 00:11:37.399
Despite all these disasters, our brothers and sisters remain firm in the faith.

00:11:37.399 --> 00:11:44.879
Let's hear how some in Congo, the Philippines, and the Caribbean feel about the help they've

00:11:44.879 --> 00:12:00.309
received.

00:12:00.309 --> 00:12:12.490
I sincerely thank Jehovah for the material support to help me return to my normal life.

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:19.129
For me, thank you is not enough to express my appreciation for all the good things that

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:28.919
we received since I was among those who were helped to have damaged houses repaired.

00:12:28.919 --> 00:12:35.500
The brothers really helped us.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:42.539
Despite the difficulties brought on by Typhoon Odette, Jehovah did not abandon us.

00:12:42.539 --> 00:12:44.659
He helped us.

00:12:44.659 --> 00:12:51.139
On the very next day, the brothers contacted us and provided us food and helped us repair

00:12:51.139 --> 00:12:52.139
our house.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:13:00.279
We're so thankful for Jehovah's help and for providing us our needs so that we can

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:16.139
continue with our lives.

00:13:16.139 --> 00:13:21.179
I sincerely thank Jehovah and his organization for the love they have shown us during this

00:13:21.179 --> 00:13:26.299
time that we became victims of volcanic eruption.

00:13:26.299 --> 00:13:30.460
We don't know what words to use to express our gratitude.

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:37.019
Just like Jehovah has taken us by the hand, caring for us, and saying, do not be afraid,

00:13:37.019 --> 00:13:38.940
I will help you.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:43.220
Honestly, we are very thankful.

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:48.419
Thank you so much for getting us this house because our house burned down.

00:13:48.419 --> 00:13:57.220
And to you, servants of Jehovah, I want to tell you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:16.120
I left a glove at the door of Samayta.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:21.039
The condition that we left our home in and coming back and seeing the work that the

00:14:21.039 --> 00:14:27.639
brothers did for us, I don't know how to put it into words.

00:14:27.639 --> 00:14:33.279
I love and appreciate every single one of you and what you have done for us, you will

00:14:33.279 --> 00:14:42.590
never understand just how much it means to know that we don't have to do this by ourselves.

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:50.470
For really, really experienced Jehovah's Hand and his love, we got to heal our Jehovah's

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:51.470
life.

00:14:51.470 --> 00:15:06.240
I'm very, very thankful to Jehovah's Blessing.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:11.799
Another challenge our brothers and sisters are facing is persecution.

00:15:11.799 --> 00:15:15.679
Take for example, Sister Anna Safronova.

00:15:15.679 --> 00:15:24.720
On January 25th, 56-year-old Anna was sentenced to six years in a penal colony.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:33.080
This is the harshest, longest sentence imposed on a sister in Russia since the 2017 ban.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:40.840
The court imprisoned Anna even though she was the caregiver for her 81-year-old mother.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:45.879
What challenges do the family members of those imprisoned face?

00:15:45.879 --> 00:15:48.960
How is Jehovah helping them?

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:54.929
Let's watch the following interviews from Russia.

00:15:54.929 --> 00:16:04.450
Our trials and hardships began on June 12th, 2018, when authorities searched our home.

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:13.159
And then we didn't see Alexey for 11 months because he was in the pretrial detention center.

00:16:13.159 --> 00:16:22.179
The judge sentenced him to three and a half years in a general regime prison colony.

00:16:22.179 --> 00:16:24.379
Then another terrible thing happened.

00:16:24.379 --> 00:16:30.299
It was the fire when our home burned to the ground in the middle of the night.

00:16:30.299 --> 00:16:35.620
In October 2020, the children and I got COVID.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:40.700
And just recently we came down with COVID for a second time.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.580
I live with my daughter Anna.

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:48.980
In July 2021, our home was searched.

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:57.220
And on January 25th, 2022, a court sentenced her to six years in prison.

00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:07.559
We were not even allowed to say goodbye to each other.

00:17:07.559 --> 00:17:13.970
My dad has been in a prison for a year and a half already.

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:19.650
In January this year, he was sentenced to seven years in a correctional facility.

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:26.170
Along with all of that, at the end of last year, my mother died unexpectedly from COVID.

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:31.730
One trial is difficult enough, but when you get two at the same time,

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:39.859
so the two people who are dearest to me are no longer with me.

00:17:39.859 --> 00:17:46.539
I pray to Jehovah and feel that he gives me peace of heart and the sense of calm.

00:17:46.539 --> 00:17:50.059
Anna don't worry quite as much.

00:17:50.059 --> 00:17:56.779
Friends come over and help me with the cleaning and they go shopping for me and we chat.

00:17:56.779 --> 00:18:04.609
In all of that, I see Jehovah's hand, his help and his support.

00:18:04.609 --> 00:18:10.529
Jehovah constantly strengthened us by means of his word and he used the brothers.

00:18:10.529 --> 00:18:17.609
For example, our friends sent us text messages quoting the very scriptures that gave me strength.

00:18:17.609 --> 00:18:19.690
These were answers to my prayers.

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:24.569
It was my parents' wedding anniversary and all day it was like,

00:18:24.569 --> 00:18:29.569
Karyas were bringing us gifts, flowers and parcels.

00:18:29.569 --> 00:18:33.250
It was like the whole day the house was full of flowers.

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:35.730
It was as though Jehovah were shouting to us,

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:38.650
I love you, I'm right with you, I won't leave you.

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:47.440
And Sasha said, Mom, if dad had been free, we would only have had one bouquet of flowers and the most.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:53.039
Do you remember that time when you were afraid to shout out, Dad, I love you, hang in there.

00:18:53.039 --> 00:18:54.440
Jehovah loves you.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:19:02.769
You mustered up courage and we prayed as well.

00:19:02.769 --> 00:19:08.529
And then he wrote in letters that he cried because he was so happy that he had heard me.

00:19:08.529 --> 00:19:11.130
My faith had only been made stronger.

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:13.769
I've started reading the Bible every day.

00:19:13.769 --> 00:19:17.130
Also, I've taken a big step towards Jehovah.

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:20.809
Even too, I dedicated my life to him and was baptized.

00:19:22.329 --> 00:19:28.170
Many times I remember the thought that Jehovah often embraces us using someone else's arms.

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:32.849
Well, in these last years we have felt Jehovah's embrace many times.

00:19:32.849 --> 00:19:36.569
Jehovah always turns hardships into blessings.

00:19:36.569 --> 00:19:39.210
There was the fire and we lost our home.

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:43.009
But now we have a new home, which is better than the previous one.

00:19:43.009 --> 00:19:47.170
I'm certain that whatever happens, we will definitely get through it.

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:54.420
The main thing is to be close to Jehovah.

00:19:54.420 --> 00:20:03.220
We are so proud of all those who are standing firm in the faith, despite persecution.

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:08.500
We're reminded of 2 Corinthians chapter 4, verse 9.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:12.539
We are persecuted, but not abandoned.

00:20:12.539 --> 00:20:17.380
We are knocked down, but not destroyed.

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:22.619
Jehovah will never abandon his faithful servants.

00:20:22.619 --> 00:20:25.819
As we've been reminded in this update,

00:20:25.819 --> 00:20:31.819
our brothers and sisters worldwide continue to stand firm in the faith

00:20:31.819 --> 00:20:40.380
despite military actions, a global pandemic, disasters, and persecution.

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:46.500
Brothers and sisters, as 1 Peter chapter 5 and verse 8 says,

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.900
keep your senses.

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.420
Be watchful.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:59.779
Our adversary, Satan the Devil, has filled this world with his satanic propaganda.

00:20:59.779 --> 00:21:01.740
Be cautious.

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:04.980
Take your stand against him.

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:11.019
As the world becomes more and more nationalistic and divided,

00:21:11.019 --> 00:21:15.059
we will not compromise our neutrality.

00:21:15.059 --> 00:21:20.740
We will remain united in our loyalty to God's kingdom

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:24.180
and in our love for one another.

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:30.539
Continue to listen to the voice of our fine shepherd, Jesus Christ,

00:21:30.539 --> 00:21:35.380
and his appointed channel, the faithful and discreet slave.

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:39.779
Our Almighty God, Jehovah, is with us,

00:21:39.779 --> 00:21:44.380
and we have our worldwide brotherhood to support us.

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:47.059
No matter what trials lay ahead,

00:21:47.059 --> 00:21:53.299
we have everything we need to remain faithful to Jehovah.

00:21:53.299 --> 00:21:58.940
Dear brothers and sisters, we love you all very much.

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:02.460
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:04.740
this is JW Broadcasting.
