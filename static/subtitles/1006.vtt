WEBVTT

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.829
Greetings, brothers and sisters.

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:21.829
Today's session will begin with a music video presentation

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:25.829
that reminds us of our privilege and responsibility

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:27.829
to help others develop faith.

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:30.829
Please enjoy the presentation.

00:00:58.409 --> 00:10:31.250
Welcome back to our Powerful by Faith Regional Convention.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:34.250
During this session and the next one,

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:37.250
you will hear the talks listed under the Saturday Heading

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:39.250
of your printed program.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:44.529
The scripture theme for today's program is taken from Jude

00:10:44.529 --> 00:10:50.529
3, where we are told to put up a hard fight for the faith.

00:10:50.529 --> 00:10:54.529
We'll see how we can demonstrate our faith regardless of our

00:10:54.529 --> 00:10:59.529
circumstances, and we'll see how we can help others to build faith.

00:10:59.529 --> 00:11:05.129
Now, let's share in singing song number 57, entitled,

00:11:05.129 --> 00:11:08.129
preaching to all sorts of people.

00:11:08.129 --> 00:13:54.340
Again, that song number 57, in your ministry,

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:59.340
do you meet some who seem unlikely to respond favorably?

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:02.340
Are you prepared to help them?

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:06.340
As we will see in our first symposium of this session,

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:10.340
our attitude toward others can affect how we give a witness

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:13.340
and how people might respond.

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:18.970
Each speaker will introduce the one to follow.

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:21.970
Please give your attention to Brother Ronald Curson,

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:23.970
a helper to the teaching committee.

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:25.970
He will begin with a theme.

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:29.970
Remember, faithless people can acquire faith.

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:31.970
The Ninevites.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:41.909
Impossible. It will never happen.

00:14:41.909 --> 00:14:43.909
Not in a million years.

00:14:43.909 --> 00:14:47.909
Have you ever thought that way about someone coming into the truth?

00:14:47.909 --> 00:14:51.909
Well, that might be our limited view of a person.

00:14:51.909 --> 00:14:54.909
But how does Jehovah view him or her?

00:14:54.909 --> 00:14:59.909
And what is his view of all humans, even faithless ones?

00:14:59.909 --> 00:15:06.909
Notice his limitless view at 1 Timothy, chapter 2 and verse 4.

00:15:06.909 --> 00:15:11.909
There it says, whose will is that all sorts of people should be saved

00:15:11.909 --> 00:15:15.909
and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.

00:15:15.909 --> 00:15:18.909
So what is Jehovah's desire?

00:15:18.909 --> 00:15:21.909
It's his will that all hear the message

00:15:21.909 --> 00:15:25.909
and be allowed to make changes and be saved.

00:15:25.909 --> 00:15:27.909
Now to us that might be impossible,

00:15:27.909 --> 00:15:30.909
but we know with God all things are possible.

00:15:30.909 --> 00:15:35.909
He can stir the heart and he can motivate anyone.

00:15:35.909 --> 00:15:39.909
While it's true that faith is not the possession of all people,

00:15:39.909 --> 00:15:43.909
it is the possession of millions around the world.

00:15:43.909 --> 00:15:47.909
And it can be for those who choose to acquire it.

00:15:47.909 --> 00:15:51.909
We know the Bible contains many examples of men and women

00:15:51.909 --> 00:15:55.909
who at one time lacked faith, but later acquired it.

00:15:55.909 --> 00:15:57.909
And the same is true today.

00:15:57.909 --> 00:15:59.909
It's not impossible.

00:15:59.909 --> 00:16:03.909
This symposium will help us to remember this fact.

00:16:03.909 --> 00:16:09.909
Faithless people can acquire faith if we have Jehovah's view

00:16:09.909 --> 00:16:14.909
of all sorts of people to hear God's word and make adjustments.

00:16:14.909 --> 00:16:19.909
We will discuss four groups of people in this symposium,

00:16:19.909 --> 00:16:24.909
the Ninevites, Jesus' fleshly brothers, prominent ones,

00:16:24.909 --> 00:16:26.909
and non-religious people.

00:16:26.909 --> 00:16:29.909
And in each one of these symposium talks,

00:16:29.909 --> 00:16:32.909
we will consider what help former unbelievers

00:16:32.909 --> 00:16:36.909
to acquire faith and what we can learn.

00:16:36.909 --> 00:16:40.909
First, let's consider the example of the Ninevites.

00:16:40.909 --> 00:16:43.909
As you recall, they are Assyrians or were Assyrians

00:16:43.909 --> 00:16:46.909
who lived in the capital city of Nineveh,

00:16:46.909 --> 00:16:48.909
and it was founded by Nimrod.

00:16:48.909 --> 00:16:51.909
It was referred to as the city of bloodshed.

00:16:51.909 --> 00:16:53.909
With that history and backdrop,

00:16:53.909 --> 00:16:56.909
we can imagine what the people were like.

00:16:56.909 --> 00:16:59.909
They worship God's of war.

00:16:59.909 --> 00:17:01.909
War was their religion.

00:17:01.909 --> 00:17:04.910
Yes, they were aggressive, they were violent people,

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:09.910
and they took pleasure in sadistically torturing their captives.

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:13.910
Well, their reputation was known by all the surrounding nations,

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:15.910
including God's people.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:18.910
So that's why Jehovah sent his prophet Jonah

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:21.910
to go there and proclaim their destruction.

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:24.910
As we noticed this first video,

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:27.910
imagine how Jonah must have felt going into Nineveh,

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:31.910
going through the streets and observing the people of Nineveh,

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:33.910
contemplating his warning message.

00:17:33.910 --> 00:18:49.710
How did Jonah view his assignment?

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:52.710
Well, at this time, he did not have Jehovah's view.

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:54.710
He was afraid of the Ninevites,

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:56.710
maybe what they thought of him,

00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:59.710
or what they would do once they heard his message.

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:01.710
Well, Jonah was human.

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:03.710
He had feelings like ours.

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:07.710
A human tendency is to judge people on what we see

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:09.710
or what we hear about them.

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:11.710
If you were alive then,

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:15.710
and Jehovah gave you this assignment instead of Jonah,

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:17.710
how might you have reacted?

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:19.710
Would you have thought about the Ninevites

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:22.710
and their cruelty and their wickedness and say,

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:26.710
they can't change or would you feel it's impossible?

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:29.710
It'll never happen, not in a million years.

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:31.710
Well, that's how Jonah felt.

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:35.710
But Jehovah corrected his view of his assignment

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:37.710
as well as the people.

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:40.710
And he took that message

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:43.710
and that counsel from Jehovah to heart.

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:47.710
He proclaimed the message to the people of Ninevah.

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:50.710
He certainly got the Ninevites attention,

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:52.710
but he might have thought to himself,

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:54.710
well, this is the end for me.

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:56.710
But how did they respond?

00:19:56.710 --> 00:20:02.890
Notice, Jonah chapter three and verse five.

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:06.890
It says, and the men of Ninevah put faith in God.

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:09.890
So this surprise even Jonah himself,

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:12.890
the king made a proclamation for all the people

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:15.890
of what they should do to demonstrate their faith.

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:17.890
Notice verse eight.

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:19.890
It says, let them be covered with sackcloth,

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:21.890
both man and beast,

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:24.890
and let them call out earnestly to God,

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:26.890
and turn from their evil ways

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:28.890
and from the violence they practice.

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:30.890
Who knows whether the true God

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:33.890
may reconsider what he intends to do

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:35.890
and turn from his burning anger

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:39.890
so that we may not perish?

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:44.890
What helped the Ninevites to change to acquire faith?

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:48.890
It was a direct result of Jonah accomplishing his assignment,

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:52.890
boldly preaching God's message.

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:54.890
They were given the opportunity to change

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:58.890
and to Jonah's surprise, they did.

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:00.890
But Jonah had to make changes too.

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:03.890
He had to take his limited view of his assignment

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:06.890
and the people and change it to the limitless view

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:09.890
that Jehovah had, that people can change

00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:12.890
and Jehovah can stir their hearts.

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:15.890
And Jonah had to look at himself

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:17.890
and relook at his assignment.

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:20.890
He was not the judge, he was not the jury,

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:23.890
he was a messenger.

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:26.890
Having Jehovah's view changes everything.

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:28.890
How we view others, how we view ourselves,

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:31.890
how we view our assignments today.

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:34.890
We are ministers who have a message.

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:37.890
We are not the judges.

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:39.890
Well, Jehovah is the judge.

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:41.890
And how did he judge the Ninevites

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:45.890
worthy of being saved and have his mercy?

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:51.890
Notice, Jonah, chapter 3, and their in verse 10.

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:54.890
It says, when the true God saw what they did

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:57.890
and how they had turned back from their evil ways,

00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:01.890
he reconsidered the calamity that he said he would bring on them.

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:05.890
And he did not bring it.

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:10.140
In the following video, notice the changes

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:13.140
that the Ninevites made and how they benefited.

00:22:13.140 --> 00:23:01.950
Are you Jonah?

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:03.950
I am.

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:04.950
Thank you.

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:15.210
Well, the Ninevites certainly changed

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:18.210
from the first video that we watched.

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:20.210
Changes they made on the inside,

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:23.210
allowed them to make changes on the outside,

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:25.210
how they viewed their fellow Ninevites

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:27.210
and how they treated them.

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:30.210
And their dispositions changed from gloomy,

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:34.210
unhappy faces to smiling, happy ones.

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:37.210
They were appreciative of Jonah's warning message

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:40.210
as well as Jehovah's mercy.

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:43.210
What's the lesson for us?

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:45.210
The same lesson that Jonah learned.

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:49.210
We need to show compassion as Jehovah does.

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:52.210
This means more than just noticing that someone needs help,

00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:55.210
but taking the time and having the desire

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:59.210
to try to relieve that pain, help them.

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:03.210
How can we imitate Jehovah's compassion today?

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:06.210
It's by putting compassion into action.

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:09.210
And we do this by our preaching.

00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:11.210
And we do this to all persons,

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:14.210
giving them an opportunity to change

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:16.210
and not be judgmental.

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:18.210
By viewing them as potential sheep

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:22.210
as our future brother or sister.

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:24.210
Like the Ninevites,

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:26.210
many today are taught wrong beliefs

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:28.210
and attitudes from childhood.

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:30.210
And it may be difficult to change,

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:33.210
but not impossible.

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:35.210
What can help them change?

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:39.210
Hebrews 4.12 says the word of God can help.

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:44.210
The word of God is alive and exerts power.

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:46.210
Many of us are living proof

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:49.210
of the Bible's power to change us.

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:51.210
Before learning the truth,

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:55.210
some of us might have been violent, immoral, faithless.

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:57.210
But as the Apostle Paul says,

00:24:57.210 --> 00:25:00.210
that is what some of you were.

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:02.210
They change back then.

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:04.210
People are changing today.

00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:06.210
With the help of God's Word

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:07.210
and His Holy Spirit,

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:10.210
we can help others change.

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:12.210
And we cannot read hearts.

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:14.210
But we know that Jehovah can.

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:18.210
And he can stir the heart, motivate anyone.

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:21.210
What can we do in the meantime?

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:27.210
We can remember to follow what Romans chapter 10 and verse 16 says.

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:30.210
Our assignment is to be a messenger.

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:32.210
Notice verse 16.

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:34.210
Nevertheless,

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:36.210
they did not all obey the good news.

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:38.210
For Isaiah says,

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:41.210
Jehovah, who has put faith in the thing heard from us?

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:44.210
So faith follows the thing heard.

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:48.210
In turn, what is heard is through the word about Christ.

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:51.210
Faith follows the things heard.

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:54.210
What motivated the Ninevice to change?

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:57.210
It was only after they heard Jonas' warning message.

00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:01.210
It is our hope and prayer that many will put faith in God

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:04.210
because of the warning message that we give.

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:09.210
So may we be like Jonah, be compassionate, but bold,

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:11.210
and preaching the good news to all.

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:15.210
Who knows, faith may follow the things heard.

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:18.210
Remember, it is possible.

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:23.210
Faithless people can acquire faith.

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:26.210
Brother Mark Sanderson, a member of the governing body,

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:29.210
will now consider the next part of this symposium.

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:32.210
Remember, faithless people can acquire faith.

00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:34.210
Jesus, fleshly brothers.

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:46.059
Do you have relatives that are presently not serving Jehovah?

00:26:46.059 --> 00:26:50.059
I think most of us do, and we're not alone.

00:26:50.059 --> 00:26:54.059
Even our Lord Jesus had that same circumstance.

00:26:54.059 --> 00:26:59.059
Even though his half-brothers knew about the miracles he was performing,

00:26:59.059 --> 00:27:06.059
the Bible says that they were not expressing faith in Jesus as the Messiah.

00:27:06.059 --> 00:27:12.059
Well, it was so bad, can you imagine, that when Jesus was being put to death,

00:27:12.059 --> 00:27:15.059
it appears that his brothers were not there.

00:27:15.059 --> 00:27:19.059
Remember the account where Jesus was on the torture stake,

00:27:19.059 --> 00:27:23.059
and he looked down at the disciple and asked him, basically,

00:27:23.059 --> 00:27:26.059
to become responsible for his mother.

00:27:26.059 --> 00:27:29.059
They weren't there to support him.

00:27:29.059 --> 00:27:35.059
But what happened just a short while after Jesus had been resurrected?

00:27:35.059 --> 00:27:40.059
Well, it was amazing because some of those half-brothers

00:27:40.059 --> 00:27:46.059
found, along with Jesus' mother, with the disciples fervently praying.

00:27:46.059 --> 00:27:49.059
Can you imagine how Jesus must have felt?

00:27:49.059 --> 00:27:56.059
Can you imagine the joy he must have experienced to see them now beginning to express faith?

00:27:56.059 --> 00:27:59.059
Well, maybe you've had that experience too.

00:27:59.059 --> 00:28:03.059
Maybe one of your relatives, maybe your mate, one of your children,

00:28:03.059 --> 00:28:07.059
one of your siblings, has now come to serve Jehovah.

00:28:07.059 --> 00:28:09.059
How wonderful.

00:28:09.059 --> 00:28:12.059
Really, nothing could compare to it.

00:28:12.059 --> 00:28:18.059
Well, what was it that helped Jesus' half-brothers to go from being faithless

00:28:18.059 --> 00:28:20.059
to putting faith in him?

00:28:20.059 --> 00:28:24.059
And what can you and I learn from that example?

00:28:24.059 --> 00:28:26.059
Well, let's address that question.

00:28:26.059 --> 00:28:31.059
What was it that helped Jesus' brothers to acquire faith?

00:28:31.059 --> 00:28:34.059
Well, here's the number one thing.

00:28:34.059 --> 00:28:38.059
Jesus was patient with his relatives.

00:28:39.059 --> 00:28:45.059
Now, that's an important point because look at how Jesus was treated by his relatives.

00:28:45.059 --> 00:28:50.059
Would you look with me at Mark chapter 3 and verse 21?

00:28:50.059 --> 00:28:55.059
It says there, but when his relatives heard about it,

00:28:55.059 --> 00:29:02.059
they went out to seize him, for they were saying he has gone out of his mind.

00:29:02.059 --> 00:29:07.059
Jesus did not take offense, even though his relatives were trying to seize him,

00:29:07.059 --> 00:29:10.059
even though they said he had gone crazy.

00:29:10.059 --> 00:29:14.059
Have your relatives perhaps said some things like that to you?

00:29:14.059 --> 00:29:19.059
Jesus did not take offense, he was patient.

00:29:19.059 --> 00:29:24.059
Well, in fact, after his resurrection, look what Jesus did.

00:29:24.059 --> 00:29:29.059
Let's go to 1 Corinthians chapter 15 and let's read together verse 7.

00:29:29.059 --> 00:29:36.059
It says, after that, he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.

00:29:37.059 --> 00:29:41.059
Now, this is just a very small detail, but did you notice what it said?

00:29:41.059 --> 00:29:45.059
So Jesus appeared to James.

00:29:45.059 --> 00:29:50.059
Now, we don't know what Jesus said to James when he appeared to him,

00:29:50.059 --> 00:29:57.059
but the point is that Jesus made a special effort to appear to his half-brother James.

00:29:57.059 --> 00:30:03.059
Well, James must have deeply appreciated that special attention from Jesus.

00:30:03.059 --> 00:30:05.059
And why do we say that?

00:30:05.059 --> 00:30:13.059
Well, Jesus, excuse me, James, went on to become a respected elder in the congregation in Jerusalem.

00:30:13.059 --> 00:30:20.059
In fact, you may remember that in Acts chapter 15, when the apostles and older men gathered in Jerusalem

00:30:20.059 --> 00:30:28.059
to consider the matter about circumcision, it seems that James was the one who was presiding at that meeting.

00:30:28.059 --> 00:30:30.059
Well, what had happened?

00:30:30.059 --> 00:30:38.059
James had gone from being a faithless person to now being a pillar in the congregation.

00:30:38.059 --> 00:30:48.059
James and his other half-brother Jude both had the privilege of writing letters that were included in the Christian Greek scriptures.

00:30:48.059 --> 00:30:57.059
Well, now, in the following video, please take careful note of what helped a family member to be a person with faith.

00:31:00.519 --> 00:31:04.519
The truth came to our home through my mother.

00:31:04.519 --> 00:31:08.519
I was never seriously interested in the truth.

00:31:08.519 --> 00:31:11.519
Where we grew up, education was very important.

00:31:11.519 --> 00:31:15.519
A person needed to make money and live a lavish life.

00:31:15.519 --> 00:31:23.519
So that's the life I chose, to study, to get higher education so that I could have what others had.

00:31:24.519 --> 00:31:30.519
Although they could see that I wasn't interested in the truth, my mother and brother did not give up on me.

00:31:30.519 --> 00:31:38.519
When I came back from school in January, my mother ordered the examining the scriptures daily booklet for me.

00:31:38.519 --> 00:31:45.519
Year after year, I always had the examining the scriptures daily booklet and the Bible.

00:31:45.519 --> 00:31:52.799
She made sure that although I wasn't attending meetings, at least I had literature.

00:31:52.799 --> 00:32:00.799
Besides that, my younger brother, the one I was close to, decided to take the truth seriously.

00:32:00.799 --> 00:32:05.799
When I came back from school, I saw my brother getting a Bible study of his own.

00:32:05.799 --> 00:32:11.799
And I was surprised to see him studying the Bible and noticed that he had prepared.

00:32:11.799 --> 00:32:15.799
He cared about and loved what he was learning.

00:32:15.799 --> 00:32:20.799
That's when I understood that the Bible changes lives.

00:32:20.799 --> 00:32:27.799
A scripture that comes to mind is the Hosea 11 verse 4.

00:32:27.799 --> 00:32:33.799
There it shows that Jehovah pulls us with cords of love and kindness.

00:32:33.799 --> 00:32:37.799
In my situation, Jehovah did this.

00:32:37.799 --> 00:32:42.799
So I made the decision to be regular at the congregation meetings.

00:32:42.799 --> 00:32:49.799
And I finally started studying the Bible with someone in 2007 and got baptized in 2008.

00:32:49.799 --> 00:32:54.799
My family really encouraged me. They never gave up on me.

00:32:54.799 --> 00:32:58.799
And I encouraged parents not to give up on their children.

00:32:58.799 --> 00:33:08.140
They must continue encouraging them and have the hope that Jehovah God will draw them to the organization

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:14.250
because they have good hearts.

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:20.250
Well brothers and sisters, we want that same experience for our relatives.

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:25.250
What can we do to help them to grow in faith?

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:30.250
Well let's talk briefly about three things. Here's the first one.

00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:38.250
Be patient with your relatives. We want to imitate the example of our wonderful God, Jehovah.

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:45.250
Do you remember when the nation of Israel went to stray so many times? Well in Jeremiah chapter 44,

00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:50.250
the Bible says that Jehovah sent his prophets again and again.

00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:54.250
He was very patient with his people.

00:33:54.250 --> 00:34:00.250
We want to be patient with our relatives too. Don't give up on them.

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:03.250
And then second, we want to be tactful.

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:08.250
We want to look for ways that we can stimulate their interest in the truth.

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:16.250
It's true, Jesus described the message of the truth like water that could lead to everlasting life.

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:23.250
But have you ever tried to drink from a fire hydrant? That's a very difficult thing to do.

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:32.250
We don't want our relatives to choke because we're forcing too much information or with too much force or power.

00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:38.250
Instead, we want our relatives to feel refreshed by the truth.

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:47.250
Well whether our relatives feel choked or refreshed will really depend on how we go about explaining the truth to them.

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:54.250
So be tactful and speak to them in a loving way that will stimulate their interest.

00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:57.250
Let's go to that third point.

00:34:57.250 --> 00:35:03.250
We want to show empathy to our relatives and let our conduct speak for us.

00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:12.250
You know, when we first learn the truth, our relatives may not be sure of how now this is going to affect our relationship with them.

00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:16.250
Instead of thinking of many, many different things that we could say,

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:25.250
it's important to remember that what we do is going to speak far more loudly than the things that we say.

00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:32.250
You know there's a saying that says, I'd rather see a sermon than hear one, isn't that true?

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:38.250
One sister named Pauline realized that instead of talking to her husband so much about the truth,

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:40.250
she needed to set a good example.

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:47.250
Well when her husband observed the good effect that the Bible was having on his wife and on his children,

00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:53.250
that was the thing that opened his mind and opened his heart to the message of the good news.

00:35:53.250 --> 00:36:01.250
You just don't know, brothers and sisters, the good effect of your conduct, of your example on your relatives.

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:06.250
You know about two years ago I was out in California at a regional convention,

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:10.250
and a sister came up to me with two brothers.

00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:19.250
Now she had been raised by her faithful mother in the truth, but she had gone away from the truth for more than 30 years.

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:24.250
She watched a broadcast, and she was moved to return.

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:30.250
She then reached out to her brother, who was also away from the truth for more than 30 years.

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:35.250
He decided to come back too, and then the two of them reached out to their other brother,

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:40.250
who was also away for more than 30 years, and he also came back.

00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:43.250
Hear the three of them were in front of me.

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:48.250
Well the sister said, I think my mother is going to have to be resurrected twice.

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:52.250
We were all out of the truth when she died.

00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:59.250
When she sees us in the new world, she'll be so shocked, I'm sure she'll need to be resurrected again.

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:01.250
What's the point?

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:08.250
The good example of their mother stayed with them even long after their mother had passed away.

00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:14.250
Brothers and sisters, Jehovah can use you to help your relatives.

00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:21.250
They might be faithless right now, but with your help they can become full of faith.

00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:26.250
It worked in the case of Jesus, and it can work for you too.

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:34.250
Now, brother Ralph Walls, a helper to the personnel committee, will consider the next talk of this symposium.

00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:39.250
Remember, faithless people can acquire faith, prominent ones.

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:53.809
Some years ago, a brother in Mexico from the rural's, dressed in very simple countryguard,

00:37:53.809 --> 00:37:56.809
knocked at the door of a palatial mansion.

00:37:56.809 --> 00:38:01.809
A man in a silicon bathrobe responded and asked what he wanted.

00:38:01.809 --> 00:38:09.809
The witness said, if a mule should come to your door with two bags of gold, would you accept it?

00:38:09.809 --> 00:38:14.809
Annoyed, the householder replied, I do not understand what you're telling me.

00:38:14.809 --> 00:38:18.809
I am a famous engineer.

00:38:18.809 --> 00:38:23.809
The witness then asked him, what do you understand about prophecies?

00:38:23.809 --> 00:38:27.809
The man admitted that he did not know anything about them.

00:38:27.809 --> 00:38:32.809
Then the witness said, that is what I want to speak to you about.

00:38:32.809 --> 00:38:41.809
I am that mule that came to your door, and the two bags of gold are these magazines, the watchtower and the wake.

00:38:41.809 --> 00:38:46.809
The man was impressed by the presentation of this humble witness and took the two magazines.

00:38:46.809 --> 00:38:49.809
Did that man come into the truth?

00:38:49.809 --> 00:38:51.809
We don't know.

00:38:51.809 --> 00:39:00.809
But what we do know is that our humble brother gave that man an opportunity for Jehovah to stir his heart.

00:39:00.809 --> 00:39:08.809
In the first century, many prominent Jews hesitated to follow Jesus because they feared becoming outcasts.

00:39:08.809 --> 00:39:19.809
The account in the Gospel of John chapter 12 says, many even of the rulers actually put faith in him,

00:39:19.809 --> 00:39:28.809
but they would not acknowledge him because of the Pharisees so that they would not be expelled from the synagogue.

00:39:29.809 --> 00:39:36.809
However, some overcame social pressure and took a stand for Jesus.

00:39:36.809 --> 00:39:48.809
The Bible tells us of Joseph of Arimathea, a reputable member of the council who took courage and went in before Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.

00:39:48.809 --> 00:39:58.809
And the Book of Acts reports that the Word of God continued to spread and a large crowd of priests began to be obedient to the faith.

00:39:58.809 --> 00:40:06.809
An outstanding example of a prominent one is Saul of Tarsus, who later became the Apostle Paul.

00:40:06.809 --> 00:40:12.809
He was a Pharisee and one who persecuted Jewish Christians.

00:40:12.809 --> 00:40:24.809
He admitted this saying, I persecuted this way to the point of death, binding and handing over to prisons both men and women.

00:40:24.809 --> 00:40:30.809
But he changed and became a zealous preacher and an apostle.

00:40:30.809 --> 00:40:38.809
Similarly today, some who had a high social position in this world have become believers.

00:40:38.809 --> 00:40:41.809
What helped Saul acquire faith?

00:40:41.809 --> 00:40:44.809
Let's let Paul tell us.

00:40:44.809 --> 00:40:53.809
Please turn to Acts chapter 22 and we'll read verses 6-8.

00:40:53.809 --> 00:41:00.090
Acts 22, 6-8. He says,

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:11.090
But as I was traveling and getting near to Damascus about midday, suddenly out of heaven a great light flashed all around me.

00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:20.090
And I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:24.090
I answered, Who are you, Lord?

00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:32.090
And he said to me, I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you are persecuting.

00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:40.090
Yes, it was by Jesus miraculously appearing to Saul and identifying himself a shocking event.

00:41:40.090 --> 00:41:46.090
As a result, Saul completely changed his values and priorities in life.

00:41:46.090 --> 00:41:53.090
Later he was inspired to write something that reflects an entirely different viewpoint.

00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:55.090
Let's read it.

00:41:55.090 --> 00:42:02.090
It's in the book of Philippians chapter 3 and notice what he says in verses 7-8.

00:42:02.090 --> 00:42:10.849
Yet the things that were gains to me, I have considered loss on account of the Christ.

00:42:10.849 --> 00:42:20.849
What is more, I do indeed consider all things to be lost on account of the excelling value of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord.

00:42:20.849 --> 00:42:31.849
For His sake, I have taken the loss of all things and considered them as a lot of refuse that I may gain Christ.

00:42:31.849 --> 00:42:36.849
What was it that moved Paul to have such a change?

00:42:36.849 --> 00:42:51.219
Jehovah used a startling occasion to stir Paul's heart, world events, personal tragedy, or other change circumstances, though not initiated by Jehovah,

00:42:51.219 --> 00:42:59.219
may cause a person prominent in this system of things to reevaluate his or her life and listen to the good news.

00:42:59.219 --> 00:43:07.219
Such a person may realize that high social status does not offer a solution to life's problems.

00:43:07.219 --> 00:43:13.219
In the following video, note how changing circumstances can affect a person's thinking.

00:43:13.219 --> 00:43:22.219
During my high school years, I would work at a shipyard as a third-class welder.

00:43:22.219 --> 00:43:34.219
It was difficult, and in the summer times it was real hot on a water, and I just said, wow, if I'm going to have to do this for 30 or 40 years, I've got to find something better.

00:43:34.219 --> 00:43:40.219
In that period of time, success will meant a good job, a lot of money, comfort.

00:43:40.219 --> 00:43:45.219
And so I went through college in four years and got an accounting degree.

00:43:45.219 --> 00:43:54.219
Every time I would get a transfer, I would get promoted so I went from Africa to Belgium, from Belgium to Scotland,

00:43:54.219 --> 00:44:00.219
back to the U.S., and then the U.S. to Singapore, and that was really a big jump.

00:44:00.219 --> 00:44:07.219
Nice cars, a driver, putting a whole lot of money in the bank.

00:44:07.219 --> 00:44:15.219
And every time I would reach one of these goals, my wife and I would sit at the table and say, now, now we're going to be happy.

00:44:15.219 --> 00:44:19.219
Now we're going to finally start to be able to enjoy this.

00:44:19.219 --> 00:44:24.219
But it was like something fleeting. It just wasn't there.

00:44:24.219 --> 00:44:29.219
The emptiness was growing bigger. The hole was getting larger.

00:44:29.219 --> 00:44:35.219
We were just perplexed. We didn't know where to go to find any kind of joy or happiness.

00:44:35.219 --> 00:44:45.219
Well, my daughter, she had a baby shop. It's so baby clothes and small baby furniture. Her and her husband ran the shop.

00:44:45.219 --> 00:44:50.219
So they hired this young girl to help with the store and to help with their children.

00:44:50.219 --> 00:44:57.219
But when she wasn't busy with the story with the children, she'd pull open her Bible and she would be reading her Bible.

00:44:57.219 --> 00:45:04.219
So they asked this young girl, do you know anybody that could study with the two kids?

00:45:04.219 --> 00:45:09.219
She said, I have the perfect people, the perfect couple.

00:45:09.219 --> 00:45:13.219
And so they set up a study the following week, one night during the week.

00:45:13.219 --> 00:45:18.219
And my daughter called me and said, Dad, can you come to this Bible study?

00:45:18.219 --> 00:45:24.219
I don't know these people and you just need to be there to make sure it's on the up and up.

00:45:24.219 --> 00:45:28.219
And so I came to that first Bible study and I watched it.

00:45:28.219 --> 00:45:31.219
I just sat there amazed.

00:45:31.219 --> 00:45:38.760
But when the study was over, I asked him, I said, would you be interested in studying with me?

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:41.760
You know, in the world, you may hit these goals.

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:45.760
But then very quickly after that, you're going way down.

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:47.760
And then you stay way down.

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:52.760
The truth brings you a constant joy. It is there's nothing like it.

00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:57.760
It's just complete satisfaction. You just know now you're doing the right thing.

00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:00.760
And it's just changed our whole life now and our whole attitude.

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:05.760
We are just so very content and happy.

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:15.260
Dear brothers, we are being encouraged to give a bold witness to prominent ones.

00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:22.260
It's natural that at times we may feel intimidated by prominent ones and hesitate to give a witness.

00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:28.260
But let's determine to imitate Jesus in what way?

00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:33.260
Notice what Isaiah 11 and verse 3 says about him.

00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:38.949
And he will find a light in the fear of Jehovah.

00:46:38.949 --> 00:46:42.949
He will not judge by what appears to his eyes.

00:46:42.949 --> 00:46:50.360
Nor reproves simply according to what his ears hear. Did you notice that?

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:55.360
So like Jesus who does not judge by what appears to his eyes,

00:46:55.360 --> 00:47:00.360
we do not want to predetermine a person's response by their outward appearance,

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:05.360
their large homes, their prominence or position.

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:12.360
We also want to imitate the Apostle Paul and his attitude after he became a Christian.

00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:19.360
Notice what he says in the book of Romans chapter 1.

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:27.360
We're going to key in in verse 16. That's Romans chapter 1 and verse 16.

00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:34.369
First we'll read the first part of that verse.

00:47:34.369 --> 00:47:41.369
It says, for I am not ashamed of the good news.

00:47:41.369 --> 00:47:49.369
Now under inspiration he then comments on the effectiveness of preaching the good news when he says,

00:47:49.369 --> 00:48:00.369
it, that is the good news, is in fact God's power for salvation to everyone having faith,

00:48:00.369 --> 00:48:05.369
to the Jew first and also to the Greek.

00:48:05.369 --> 00:48:15.369
So let's be determined to preach boldly to all, giving Jehovah the opportunity to stir the hearts of those who listen.

00:48:15.369 --> 00:48:22.420
Brother Anthony Morris of the governing body will now consider the final talk of this symposium.

00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:29.420
Remember faithless people can acquire faith, non-religious people.

00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:40.039
I'd like you to use your imagination for a moment.

00:48:40.039 --> 00:48:48.039
Think back to when you're having a conversation with someone that you respect and they're in a position of authority.

00:48:48.039 --> 00:48:59.039
Now during the conversation this person says to you, coming up to certain points and they go, remember, I want you to remember this.

00:48:59.039 --> 00:49:04.039
Well this is what Jehovah has done for us in this symposium.

00:49:04.039 --> 00:49:14.039
When somebody says remember, then most people stop in the refocus and concentrate even more.

00:49:14.039 --> 00:49:19.039
So what does Jehovah want us to remember with this specific part?

00:49:19.039 --> 00:49:27.039
Well many people that are not religious can acquire faith.

00:49:27.039 --> 00:49:35.039
And you think about every year there's people that were atheists, agnostics that have come into the truth.

00:49:35.039 --> 00:49:45.039
So the lesson in this part is do not hold back from witnessing to people that are non-religious.

00:49:45.039 --> 00:49:50.039
You don't want to take the position as if we're the judge of this.

00:49:50.039 --> 00:49:56.039
They wouldn't be interested there, atheists, they're agnostic, they're wrapped up with materialism.

00:49:56.039 --> 00:50:00.039
That's not our position to take.

00:50:00.039 --> 00:50:08.039
We want to be individuals that Jehovah will use to try to help these non-religious individuals.

00:50:08.039 --> 00:50:15.039
Now notice what Paul writes here in Romans chapter 10.

00:50:15.039 --> 00:50:24.039
And you'll find out how some have changed their mind after exposure to the truth and to Jehovah's teaching.

00:50:24.039 --> 00:50:30.039
And the only way that they could acquire faith is when this is done.

00:50:30.039 --> 00:50:37.039
Now notice carefully and pay attention Romans chapter 10, 13 through 15.

00:50:37.039 --> 00:50:42.039
For everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved.

00:50:43.039 --> 00:50:49.039
However, how will they call on him if they've not put faith in him?

00:50:49.039 --> 00:50:54.039
How in turn will they put faith in him about whom they have not heard?

00:50:54.039 --> 00:50:59.039
How in turn will they hear without someone to preach?

00:50:59.039 --> 00:51:04.039
How in turn will they preach unless they have been sent out?

00:51:04.039 --> 00:51:14.039
Just as it is written, how beautiful are the feet of those who declare good news of good things?

00:51:14.039 --> 00:51:16.039
Isn't that beautiful?

00:51:16.039 --> 00:51:22.039
See this is how an individual acquires faith by answering these questions.

00:51:22.039 --> 00:51:32.039
Very penetrating questions that all of us want to remember when it comes to witnessing to people that are non-religious.

00:51:32.039 --> 00:51:39.039
They need someone to share the good news with them, but to do it in such a way that touches their heart.

00:51:39.039 --> 00:51:41.039
And keep that in mind.

00:51:41.039 --> 00:51:48.039
It isn't always just what we say, it's how we say it that matters.

00:51:48.039 --> 00:51:53.039
Somebody has to share the good news with them if they're going to acquire faith.

00:51:53.039 --> 00:52:01.039
So the question arises here, how can we share Bible truths in a way that non-religious people

00:52:01.039 --> 00:52:05.039
are more likely to accept?

00:52:05.039 --> 00:52:07.039
Good question.

00:52:07.039 --> 00:52:17.039
So helping non-religious people acquire faith, there's an important point that the Apostle Paul shared with us in his first letter to the Corinthians.

00:52:17.039 --> 00:52:22.039
So find 1 Corinthians chapter 9.

00:52:22.039 --> 00:52:25.039
If you would please, 1 Corinthians chapter 9.

00:52:25.039 --> 00:52:29.039
Now notice the 22nd verse.

00:52:29.039 --> 00:52:32.039
To the weak, I became weak.

00:52:32.039 --> 00:52:43.039
In order to gain the weak, I have become all things to people of all sorts so that I might, by all possible means, save some.

00:52:43.039 --> 00:52:45.039
That's beautiful.

00:52:45.039 --> 00:52:52.039
What a beautiful example the Apostle Paul was with adapting to his audience.

00:52:52.039 --> 00:53:03.039
He'd speak one way to the Jews referencing the Hebrew scriptures and then different to the Greeks that didn't know about Jehovah God.

00:53:03.039 --> 00:53:09.039
So the message is to speak to them about topics that might interest them.

00:53:09.039 --> 00:53:13.039
And we had to share this issue with you.

00:53:13.039 --> 00:53:20.039
The July 2019 Watchtower, pages 22 through 23.

00:53:20.039 --> 00:53:28.039
And these are some points that you can keep in mind when it comes to witnessing to non-religious people.

00:53:28.039 --> 00:53:32.039
Very, very good advice.

00:53:32.039 --> 00:53:35.039
Notice the point here.

00:53:35.039 --> 00:53:43.039
When it comes to nature, a lot of people, they might even be atheists or agnostics, but they love nature.

00:53:43.039 --> 00:53:48.039
So using that as a basis to have a conversation is the course of wisdom.

00:53:48.039 --> 00:53:59.039
You might say something like, you probably know that many inventions come about when scientists copied things that already existed in nature.

00:53:59.039 --> 00:54:08.039
For instance, microphone designers study ears and camera designers study eyes.

00:54:08.039 --> 00:54:12.039
Now what comes to your mind when you think of nature?

00:54:12.039 --> 00:54:17.039
Do you think that it is a marvelous force, a person, or something else?

00:54:17.039 --> 00:54:22.039
Now listen attentively when you ask questions like that.

00:54:22.039 --> 00:54:24.039
And then add maybe.

00:54:24.039 --> 00:54:31.039
When engineers learn from the design of ears and eyes, we might wonder who they are learning from.

00:54:31.039 --> 00:54:35.039
I was intrigued by something an ancient poet said.

00:54:35.039 --> 00:54:40.039
Now this is wise because the poet is the Psalmist.

00:54:40.039 --> 00:54:45.039
See from Psalm 94, 910, but you could say ancient poet. That's appropriate.

00:54:45.039 --> 00:54:48.039
And here's the quote.

00:54:48.039 --> 00:54:50.039
The one who made the ear.

00:54:50.039 --> 00:54:52.039
Can he not hear?

00:54:52.039 --> 00:54:54.039
The one who formed the eye.

00:54:54.039 --> 00:54:56.039
Can he not see?

00:54:56.039 --> 00:54:59.039
He is the one who imparts knowledge to people.

00:54:59.039 --> 00:55:01.039
That beautiful.

00:55:01.039 --> 00:55:06.039
Good questions to ask and discuss with non-religious people.

00:55:06.039 --> 00:55:11.039
And then we have the marvelous website, JW.org.

00:55:11.039 --> 00:55:17.039
We've got the viewpoints on the origin of life, number of videos that can help them.

00:55:17.039 --> 00:55:24.039
Now at the same time, we want to have compassion, empathy, try to reach their heart.

00:55:24.039 --> 00:55:28.039
And there were some key points just to pass them on to you.

00:55:28.039 --> 00:55:33.039
You want to keep in mind talking, giving a witness to non-religious people.

00:55:33.039 --> 00:55:35.039
Be positive.

00:55:35.039 --> 00:55:41.039
See keep in mind every year there's non-religious people that have become Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:55:41.039 --> 00:55:43.039
This is important.

00:55:43.039 --> 00:55:46.039
Be kind and tactful.

00:55:46.039 --> 00:55:53.039
Because people will listen, not just because of what we say, but how we say it.

00:55:53.039 --> 00:55:58.039
See if you're going to reach your heart, speak from the heart.

00:55:58.039 --> 00:56:05.039
So be kind and tactful and imitate Jesus in the way He witnessed.

00:56:05.039 --> 00:56:08.039
Such compassion in love was always evident.

00:56:08.039 --> 00:56:14.039
And then this point, be understanding and listen.

00:56:14.039 --> 00:56:18.039
See that's so crucial to remember to listen.

00:56:18.039 --> 00:56:22.039
Sometimes in sincere witnesses do it.

00:56:22.039 --> 00:56:24.039
We talk too much.

00:56:24.039 --> 00:56:30.039
We ask a question and they have two seconds to answer the next thing we're talking already.

00:56:30.039 --> 00:56:32.039
But you have to listen.

00:56:32.039 --> 00:56:36.039
People are not being listened to today.

00:56:36.039 --> 00:56:38.039
Don't let that be us.

00:56:38.039 --> 00:56:42.039
See, be understanding and listen to them.

00:56:42.039 --> 00:56:46.039
Let them express themselves.

00:56:46.039 --> 00:56:50.039
You show you have empathy and love for them.

00:56:50.039 --> 00:56:54.039
So keep these thoughts in mind and Jehovah bless your efforts.

00:56:54.039 --> 00:57:04.420
In fact, in the following video, notice what has attracted non-religious people to the truth.

00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:08.420
My family were non-practicing Catholics.

00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:12.420
So I was never taught to believe in God.

00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:18.420
I trusted my teachers more than anyone else.

00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:23.920
So I accepted and loved the theory of evolution.

00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:30.920
When I was 19, a childhood friend who had become one of Jehovah's Witnesses started to call on me.

00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:34.920
I liked talking to him, but when he spoke to me about God, I told him,

00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:41.489
please, stop talking about God because I don't believe in Him.

00:57:41.489 --> 00:57:44.489
He never gave up on me.

00:57:45.489 --> 00:57:51.489
Why won't you just for a moment entertain a conversation about God?

00:57:51.489 --> 00:57:54.489
This question made me think.

00:57:54.489 --> 00:57:59.489
I had rejected his arguments without even listening to them.

00:57:59.489 --> 00:58:03.489
I didn't want to give the impression of being arrogant or stubborn.

00:58:03.489 --> 00:58:09.409
So I thought, why not let him speak?

00:58:09.409 --> 00:58:13.300
He used a book, Life.

00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:18.300
How did it get here by evolution or by creation?

00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:21.300
It was as if a veil had been lifted from my eyes.

00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:26.300
That was the moment Jehovah introduced himself to me.

00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:32.300
Finally, I understood that my life has a purpose.

00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:39.300
I regret that I didn't know Jehovah for the first 20 years of my life.

00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:45.300
My relationship with Jehovah is without doubt the most precious thing I have.

00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:50.300
I am determined to witness about Jehovah to everyone I meet,

00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:53.300
especially to those without faith,

00:58:53.300 --> 00:59:04.699
so that they too can appreciate the wonderful qualities of our Creator.

00:59:04.699 --> 00:59:10.699
Yes, non-religious people are accepting the truth.

00:59:10.699 --> 00:59:13.699
See, they can acquire faith,

00:59:13.699 --> 00:59:17.699
and those beautiful experiences prove that point.

00:59:17.699 --> 00:59:20.699
So again, we say, remember,

00:59:20.699 --> 00:59:25.699
faithless people can acquire faith.

00:59:25.699 --> 00:59:31.699
You think back to the Ninevites, Jesus' fleshly brothers,

00:59:31.699 --> 00:59:36.699
and prominent Jews, they all made great changes.

00:59:36.699 --> 00:59:39.699
And today, as in the past,

00:59:39.699 --> 00:59:45.699
here's what's happening as mentioned here in 1st Timothy, chapter 2.

00:59:45.699 --> 00:59:48.699
1st Timothy, chapter 2,

00:59:48.699 --> 00:59:52.699
where it mentions in the 4th verse about Jehovah's will,

00:59:52.699 --> 00:59:57.699
whose will is that all sorts of people should be saved

00:59:57.699 --> 00:59:59.699
and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.

00:59:59.699 --> 01:00:01.699
That's Jehovah's will.

01:00:01.699 --> 01:00:05.699
We've dedicated our life to him to do Jehovah's will.

01:00:05.699 --> 01:00:13.699
So all sorts of people are acquiring faith in Jehovah year after year.

01:00:13.699 --> 01:00:18.699
So we encourage you to give a bold but tactful witness

01:00:18.699 --> 01:00:21.699
to your unbelieving relatives,

01:00:21.699 --> 01:00:28.699
as well as to prominent ones and to non-religious people.

01:00:28.699 --> 01:00:31.699
Now, as we continue to preach to all,

01:00:31.699 --> 01:00:34.699
Jehovah will make it grow.

01:00:34.699 --> 01:00:37.699
Jehovah will bless our efforts.

01:00:37.699 --> 01:00:43.699
Remember, Jehovah can stir the hearts of any person

01:00:43.699 --> 01:00:47.699
and cause them to acquire faith.

01:00:47.699 --> 01:00:54.269
Thank you, brothers, for the encouragement to view people of all sorts

01:00:54.269 --> 01:00:56.269
as potential disciples.

01:00:56.269 --> 01:01:02.030
No doubt you were thrilled with the release of the new Bible study aid,

01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:07.030
enjoy life forever, and interactive Bible course.

01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:12.030
How can you best use this new tool to help others?

01:01:12.030 --> 01:01:16.030
Please follow along closely as Brother Robert Soranco,

01:01:16.030 --> 01:01:18.030
a helper to the writing committee,

01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:20.030
presents the talk,

01:01:20.030 --> 01:01:24.030
Bill Faith, using and joy life forever.

01:01:24.030 --> 01:01:34.530
What would you say is your greatest desire in life?

01:01:34.530 --> 01:01:38.530
If the Psalmist who wrote Psalm 146 had been asked that question,

01:01:38.530 --> 01:01:42.530
he probably would have answered with the words in the opening verses.

01:01:43.530 --> 01:01:47.530
Praise, Job, let my whole being praise Jehovah,

01:01:47.530 --> 01:01:51.530
I will praise Jehovah all my life.

01:01:51.530 --> 01:01:56.530
Is it not also our greatest desire to praise Jehovah forever

01:01:56.530 --> 01:02:00.530
and to teach others how they can worship Him along with us?

01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:05.530
Those sentiments are nicely expressed in our original song entitled,

01:02:05.530 --> 01:02:07.530
All I Can Give.

01:02:07.530 --> 01:02:10.530
Listen to a reciting of the opening words

01:02:10.530 --> 01:02:27.130
as we watch a portion of the music video.

01:02:27.130 --> 01:02:29.130
Oh, Heavenly Father,

01:02:29.130 --> 01:02:32.130
I want to give all I can give.

01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:41.420
My desire is to please you and love you as long as I live.

01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:52.369
I'll help those who listen to find in your word what they need,

01:02:52.369 --> 01:03:01.579
to preach and to teach as the way I can really succeed.

01:03:01.579 --> 01:03:10.659
As I praise you, Jehovah,

01:03:10.659 --> 01:03:13.659
my faith is getting stronger each day.

01:03:13.659 --> 01:03:21.139
I'll reflect on my dedication.

01:03:21.139 --> 01:03:24.139
I'll walk in your way.

01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:36.340
Be glad that I did not try to sing those words to you.

01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:40.340
It is true that our faith gets stronger each day,

01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:42.340
that we praise Jehovah.

01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:46.340
But what are those who do not know Him or who lack faith in Him?

01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:49.340
As we study the Bible with Him,

01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:53.340
we want to help them to find in God's word what they need

01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:56.340
to worship Jehovah with strong faith.

01:03:56.340 --> 01:03:58.340
How can we do that?

01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:01.340
Well, faith is based on evidence,

01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:05.340
so to have faith a person must first acquire an accurate knowledge

01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:09.340
of Bible truth on which they can build their faith.

01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:13.340
And a good place to start is with Jesus' words at John 17 and 3,

01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:15.340
which we know very well.

01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:17.340
In prayer to Jehovah, he said,

01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:20.340
this means everlasting life.

01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:23.340
They are coming to know you, the only true God,

01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:26.340
and the one whom you sent Jesus Christ.

01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:29.340
Now, what is Jesus saying?

01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:32.340
Well, that to gain everlasting life,

01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:36.340
people need to develop a personal relationship with Jehovah,

01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:41.340
and that requires learning the truth about both God and Christ.

01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:45.340
What does that require of us as Bible teachers?

01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:47.340
Three things.

01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:51.340
First, we have to clear up any confusion on people's minds

01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:55.340
about the identities of God and Christ.

01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:59.340
And two scriptures that we can use are Jeremiah 10, 10,

01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:02.340
and Matthew 16, 16.

01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:07.340
Jeremiah 10, 10, and Matthew 16, 16.

01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:10.340
Jeremiah 10, 10 says,

01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:12.340
but Jehovah is truly God.

01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:15.340
He is the living God.

01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:19.340
And at Matthew 16, 16, it reports,

01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:21.340
Simon Peter answered,

01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:25.340
you are the Christ, the Son of the living God.

01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:28.340
So, Jehovah is the living God,

01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:30.340
and Jesus is the Son of the living God.

01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:33.340
What could be clearer than that?

01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:38.340
And yet, simply acknowledging these basic facts is not enough.

01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:40.340
So then, second,

01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:44.340
we need to help Bible students build strong faith in Jehovah.

01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:48.340
As we learned in the first talk of this convention,

01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:52.340
having faith involves coming to know Jehovah

01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:56.340
as a real person trusting in him

01:05:56.340 --> 01:06:00.340
and forming an unbreakable friendship with him.

01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:03.340
This involves learning what Jehovah likes and dislikes

01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:06.340
and knowing his values and standards.

01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:09.340
Then the student can do what God's Son said

01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:12.340
as recorded John 14 verse 1.

01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:15.340
Exercise faith in God.

01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:18.340
But then Jesus added,

01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:21.340
exercise faith also in me.

01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:25.340
So, third, we want to help Bible students

01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:28.340
build strong faith in Jesus.

01:06:28.340 --> 01:06:32.340
What especially do they need to believe about Jesus?

01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:35.340
But we can let the Apostle Paul answer

01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:39.340
as stated at Ephesians chapter 1 verse 7.

01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:42.340
Ephesians 1 verse 7.

01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:44.340
He wrote,

01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:47.340
By means of him, we have the release by ransom

01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:49.340
through the blood of that one.

01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:52.340
Yes, the forgiveness of our trespasses,

01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:57.340
according to the riches of his undeserved kindness.

01:06:57.340 --> 01:07:01.340
When a person learns that Jesus gave his life for him personally,

01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:05.340
then he can begin to exercise faith in the power of the ransom,

01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:08.340
that it is the basis for forgiveness of one sins,

01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:12.340
that it offers the hope of everlasting life under Christ's Kingdom

01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:18.340
and that it is the greatest proof of God's love for us.

01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:22.340
People need to accept the whole truth about both Jehovah God

01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:24.340
and Jesus Christ.

01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:26.340
But still, that is not enough.

01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:30.340
For Romans 10, 10, the Bible says with the heart

01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:32.340
one exercises faith.

01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:35.340
A person must not only believe the truth

01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:38.340
but must also value it,

01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:43.340
because only then will he be motivated to act in harmony with the truth.

01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:46.340
Otherwise, he could reject convincing evidence of the truthfulness

01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:50.340
of what he is learning and continue to hold on to false beliefs

01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:53.340
and wrong practices.

01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:57.340
So we must do all we can to reach the students heart

01:07:57.340 --> 01:08:00.340
as we conduct Bible studies.

01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:04.340
Now does this seem like a daunting task for you?

01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:07.340
Well, we have been given a wonderful new tool

01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:10.340
with which to build heart-felt faith,

01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:13.340
the study book, Enjoy Life Forever,

01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:16.340
an interactive Bible course.

01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:19.340
It uses key scriptures, clear reasoning,

01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:22.340
effective questions, beautiful artwork,

01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:28.340
and stirring videos to help the teacher reach the heart of the student

01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:32.340
and draw out what he truly believes.

01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:36.340
If you have the book, or if you have it in your JW Library app

01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:38.340
on your phone or tablet,

01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:41.340
please open it now to Section 1.

01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:43.340
Section 1.

01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:48.340
And look at the lessons in that section that progressively build faith

01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:50.340
in Jehovah.

01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:55.340
In lesson 4, the student learns who the only true God is

01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:57.340
and that his name is Jehovah.

01:08:57.340 --> 01:09:01.340
Lesson 5 builds faith that Jehovah really is the author of the Bible.

01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:06.340
Lesson 6 reveals that Jehovah is the creator of the universe

01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:08.340
in the source of all life.

01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:11.340
Lesson 7 explains what Jehovah is like,

01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:15.340
that he is a real person with many appealing qualities.

01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:20.340
And Lessons 8 and 9 show how the student can become God's friend

01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:23.340
and draw close to him.

01:09:23.340 --> 01:09:26.340
Some people, however, find it difficult to imagine

01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:29.340
being friends with anyone they cannot see

01:09:29.340 --> 01:09:33.340
let alone with God himself.

01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:35.340
Open Lesson 8.

01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:38.340
Lesson 8, you can be Jehovah's friend.

01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:42.340
And in the next video, follow along as we see how a teacher uses

01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:46.340
what is provided in the book to help her students build faith

01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:50.340
in Jehovah's desire to be her friend.

01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:53.340
As we look in, they are starting to consider the information

01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:58.340
under 0.6, what Jehovah does for his friends.

01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:03.420
Okay, good, now 0.6.

01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:06.420
What Jehovah does for his friends?

01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:08.420
Cassie, can you tap that link?

01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:10.420
Jehovah has done so much for me.

01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:17.300
I was 14, things that happened in the past

01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:20.300
started to catch up with me emotionally.

01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:24.800
And I felt like everything that had happened in my life

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:28.180
was my fault.

01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:31.180
I was learning from the Bible that God says

01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:35.180
that He will take my right hand, that He will fortify me,

01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:37.180
that He will really help me.

01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:47.140
It blew me away.

01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:50.140
She mentioned a Bible passage

01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:54.140
where Jehovah takes our hand.

01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:56.140
Can you read that?

01:10:56.140 --> 01:11:00.140
At Isaiah 41, 10 and 13.

01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:07.350
Please, do not be afraid, Brian, with you.

01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:10.350
Do not be anxious for I am your God.

01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:12.350
I will fortify you.

01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:14.350
Yes, I will help you.

01:11:14.350 --> 01:11:16.350
I will really hold on to you

01:11:16.350 --> 01:11:18.350
with my right hand of righteousness.

01:11:18.350 --> 01:11:21.350
13, for I Jehovah your God

01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:23.350
and grasping your right hand.

01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:25.350
The one saying to you, do not be afraid.

01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:27.350
I will help you.

01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:29.350
So Cassie, according to these verses,

01:11:29.350 --> 01:11:32.350
what is Jehovah promised to do for all of his friends?

01:11:32.350 --> 01:11:34.350
Help us when we're down or scared?

01:11:34.350 --> 01:11:35.350
Yes.

01:11:35.350 --> 01:11:38.350
Let's look a little closer though.

01:11:38.350 --> 01:11:40.350
I will fortify.

01:11:40.350 --> 01:11:42.350
I will help.

01:11:42.350 --> 01:11:45.350
I will really hold on.

01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:48.350
Does that sound like a friend who can help

01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:51.350
or a friend who wants to help?

01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:55.350
I never thought of God, Jehovah.

01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:57.350
Like that.

01:11:57.350 --> 01:12:00.350
Do you think that Jehovah would make a good friend?

01:12:00.350 --> 01:12:02.350
Sure.

01:12:02.350 --> 01:12:08.149
Why?

01:12:08.149 --> 01:12:13.149
In verse 10, Jehovah stretches out his hand to you, which one?

01:12:13.149 --> 01:12:14.149
His right.

01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:19.149
And then in verse 13, he takes your hand.

01:12:19.149 --> 01:12:21.149
Which one?

01:12:21.149 --> 01:12:22.149
My right.

01:12:22.149 --> 01:12:24.149
How?

01:12:24.149 --> 01:12:28.460
Cassie, come here.

01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:32.460
So is Jehovah beside you?

01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:36.949
Holding your hand?

01:12:36.949 --> 01:12:41.619
Or is he in front?

01:12:41.619 --> 01:12:43.619
That's it.

01:12:43.619 --> 01:12:45.619
His right hand.

01:12:45.619 --> 01:12:48.619
Taking your right hand.

01:12:48.619 --> 01:12:50.619
He's facing you.

01:12:50.619 --> 01:12:52.619
To pull you up and out.

01:12:52.619 --> 01:13:03.899
Cassie, what does Jehovah pull you out of?

01:13:03.899 --> 01:13:10.739
Oh, bless us.

01:13:10.739 --> 01:13:16.239
And that is a direct result of friendship with Jehovah.

01:13:16.239 --> 01:13:21.239
It grows stronger the more we talk to him.

01:13:21.239 --> 01:13:30.699
Let's look at that in the next section, okay?

01:13:30.699 --> 01:13:33.699
What a beautiful example of using a joy life forever

01:13:33.699 --> 01:13:36.699
to build faith in Jehovah.

01:13:36.699 --> 01:13:39.699
This student, Cassie, appeared troubled and distressed.

01:13:39.699 --> 01:13:44.699
But the sister who is teaching her is so compassionate and patient.

01:13:44.699 --> 01:13:48.699
And did you notice that the sister did not talk too much?

01:13:48.699 --> 01:13:53.699
She just effectively used the video, scripture, and bolded questions

01:13:53.699 --> 01:13:57.699
to draw out the student's feelings and help her to visualize

01:13:57.699 --> 01:14:01.699
what Jehovah has promised to do for her.

01:14:01.699 --> 01:14:06.699
Our new study book also progressively builds faith in Jesus.

01:14:06.699 --> 01:14:09.699
Open to section two.

01:14:09.699 --> 01:14:16.699
And look at the lessons in that section that progressively build faith in Jesus.

01:14:16.699 --> 01:14:20.699
In lesson 15, the student learns who Jesus is

01:14:20.699 --> 01:14:23.699
and why learning about him is so important.

01:14:23.699 --> 01:14:28.699
Lesson 16 outlines what Jesus did on Earth and how that affects us.

01:14:29.699 --> 01:14:32.699
Lesson 17 explains what Jesus is like

01:14:32.699 --> 01:14:35.699
and how we can imitate his fine qualities.

01:14:35.699 --> 01:14:38.699
Skip down to lessons 27 and 28,

01:14:38.699 --> 01:14:45.699
which show that Jesus' death proves how much Jehovah and Jesus love us.

01:14:45.699 --> 01:14:49.699
Many people, however, do not understand the ransom sacrifice of Jesus,

01:14:49.699 --> 01:14:53.699
or they do not view it as God's personal gift to them.

01:14:53.699 --> 01:14:57.699
But the Apostle Paul believed that with all his heart.

01:14:58.699 --> 01:15:00.699
Open lesson 27.

01:15:00.699 --> 01:15:04.699
Lesson 27 entitled, how can Jesus' death save us?

01:15:04.699 --> 01:15:09.699
And go to point five, the ransom is Jehovah's gift to you.

01:15:09.699 --> 01:15:15.699
Now you'll notice that the read scripture is Galatians 2, verse 20.

01:15:15.699 --> 01:15:20.699
Galatians 2, 20, which reads,

01:15:20.699 --> 01:15:24.699
I am nailed to the stake along with Christ.

01:15:24.699 --> 01:15:29.699
It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who is living in union with me.

01:15:29.699 --> 01:15:32.699
Indeed, the life that I now live in the flesh,

01:15:32.699 --> 01:15:40.699
I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and handed himself over for me.

01:15:40.699 --> 01:15:48.079
Those words should come to mind when answering the last review question for this lesson.

01:15:48.079 --> 01:15:54.079
So in this next video, see how a teacher uses the Explore feature at the end of the lesson

01:15:54.079 --> 01:15:58.079
to reach the heart of his skeptical student.

01:15:58.079 --> 01:16:02.079
As we look in, they are discussing the last review question.

01:16:02.079 --> 01:16:12.340
Okay, Jean, the last review question is how can Jesus' death benefit you?

01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:18.189
I suppose I should say that it means forgiveness for my sins,

01:16:18.189 --> 01:16:20.189
but God's not going to forgive me.

01:16:20.189 --> 01:16:22.189
What makes you feel that way?

01:16:22.189 --> 01:16:24.189
I don't feel, I know.

01:16:24.189 --> 01:16:27.189
I made better choices in my business than I did at home.

01:16:27.189 --> 01:16:29.600
Sorry.

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:35.899
Jean, scroll down to where it says, explore,

01:16:35.899 --> 01:16:40.899
and click under, can Jehovah forgive even serious sins?

01:16:40.899 --> 01:16:41.899
Okay, got it.

01:16:41.899 --> 01:16:44.899
Can you read the second paragraph, please?

01:16:44.899 --> 01:16:46.899
Sure.

01:16:46.899 --> 01:16:53.899
Some people have committed gross sins and wonder whether God can forgive them.

01:16:53.899 --> 01:17:00.899
Happily, the Word of God says the blood of Jesus, His Son, cleanses us from all sin.

01:17:00.899 --> 01:17:07.899
Jehovah willingly forgives even serious sins if we have a proper repentance attitude.

01:17:07.899 --> 01:17:11.899
The blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin.

01:17:11.899 --> 01:17:18.899
Through the ransom, Jehovah forgives our sins, even serious ones, and He draws us to them.

01:17:18.899 --> 01:17:22.899
But Ron, why should anyone get a free pass?

01:17:22.899 --> 01:17:24.899
Because it's not free.

01:17:24.899 --> 01:17:27.899
Do you see the scripture link to Isaiah chapter 1, verse 18?

01:17:27.899 --> 01:17:28.899
I see it.

01:17:28.899 --> 01:17:30.899
Can you read it, please?

01:17:30.899 --> 01:17:34.899
Come now and let us set matter straight between us, says Jehovah.

01:17:34.899 --> 01:17:39.899
Though your sins are like scarlet, they will be made as white as snow.

01:17:39.899 --> 01:17:44.899
Though they are as red as crimson cloth, they will become like wool.

01:17:44.899 --> 01:17:51.899
So forgiveness of our sins is possible if we set matter straight.

01:17:51.899 --> 01:17:55.899
What do you, Jean, think that means?

01:17:55.899 --> 01:18:01.420
I need to do what's right.

01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:02.420
I'm trying.

01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:04.420
Yeah, that's good.

01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:06.420
It also involves how we feel.

01:18:06.420 --> 01:18:09.420
We should feel sorry. I am.

01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:12.420
No, that's a good sign, Jean.

01:18:12.420 --> 01:18:18.420
Lastly, let Jehovah help you with a step that's the hardest for many of us.

01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:22.859
He can help you forgive yourself.

01:18:22.859 --> 01:18:28.800
Jesus died for me.

01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:36.539
Ron, I think I'm going to need a little more time to process this.

01:18:36.539 --> 01:18:38.539
We all do.

01:18:38.539 --> 01:18:41.789
Let's go ahead and conclude with a prayer.

01:18:41.789 --> 01:18:48.789
And we'll specifically ask Jehovah to strengthen your faith in the ransom and his forgiveness.

01:18:48.789 --> 01:18:53.789
Later, when you pray, you can beg him for the same thing.

01:18:53.789 --> 01:18:55.789
Thank you.

01:18:55.789 --> 01:18:59.789
Okay, let's say a prayer.

01:18:59.789 --> 01:19:07.460
Jean needed convincing that Jesus' sacrifice benefited him personally.

01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:14.460
If not convinced of that in his heart, he would not have the faith needed to become Jesus' disciple.

01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:18.460
The brother was familiar with the contents of the Explore section,

01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:25.020
and chose to discuss with Jean the Watchtower article that could best help him.

01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:29.020
At other times, if needed, the teacher could give the student homework to read an article,

01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:36.020
or to watch a video from the Explore section, and get his observations at the next study session.

01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:42.020
In the video, Ron was going to pray specifically for Jehovah to strengthen Jean's faith in the ransom,

01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:44.020
and in God's forgiveness of him.

01:19:44.020 --> 01:19:52.020
What an excellent way to keep helping a student to draw close to Jehovah and build faith in God's Word.

01:19:52.020 --> 01:19:59.020
God's Spirit produces faith only in people whose heart favors the truth over lies.

01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:05.020
Let us use enjoy life forever to teach the truth to those with whom we study the Bible,

01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:09.020
and to help build their faith in Jehovah and Jesus.

01:20:09.020 --> 01:20:15.020
And let us pray for Jehovah's help to reach their heart.

01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:18.369
Thank you, Brother Sarenko.

01:20:18.369 --> 01:20:26.000
We are now even more eager to put our new Bible study aid to good use.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Now, let's sing together song number 67, which is entitled Preach the Word.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.000
That's song number 67.
