Hey everyone, guess who just walked in?

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.629
Olivia, today's poll would she ever?

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:10.189
No, she would never, she's in April.

00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:13.230
I wanted to go up to the girls and smash their phones.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.990
Neutral, ain't no neutral.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.629
You're just a coward.

00:00:16.629 --> 00:00:18.469
Take a trash.

00:00:18.469 --> 00:00:22.469
Why was feeling back then was just sadness?

00:00:22.469 --> 00:00:24.469
Never really peace.

00:00:24.469 --> 00:00:28.109
Hello everyone, Haley from Genoa Design here.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.829
Is that just a little bit of envy in there?

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.950
In June of 2018, a huge group of armed men came to us.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.750
They represented the ideals of my childhood.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.149
Do you have any idea what this is going to cost us?

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.909
I didn't have a choice. You went behind my back.

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:50.109
Where's your mask?

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:53.070
Do you know how many people have actually gotten sick?

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.229
Zero.

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:59.789
That's what always happens when you're just about to lose all your strength.

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.390
Jehovah does that something for you.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.069
I'm so grateful that we made peace before the world turned upside down.
