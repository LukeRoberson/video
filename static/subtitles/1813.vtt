00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:06.339
While we enjoy relative freedom in many countries around the world,

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:11.539
at times governments impose bans or restrictions on the preaching work.

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:17.239
Brothers Stefano's Densas serves as a special pioneer in Addis Ababa Ethiopia,

00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:20.239
along with his wife Leta Brahan.

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:24.140
Their faith was tested during many years of adversity.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.539
What helped them champion the truth?

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.239
Their story began and what is today Eritrea?

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:37.890
Will it day?

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.689
I come from a family of nine children.

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:43.490
I joined the Navy in 1956.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.189
That was during the time when Eritrea was part of Ethiopia.

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:51.289
My brother, Gebra Hewatt, asked me to come to Asmara.

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.390
He was studying the Bible with Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.189
I was so impressed with what he shared with me

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:59.390
that for the rest of my vacation,

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.390
Bible study became my priority.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.890
In time, I was discharged from the Navy and started working in Addis Ababa.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.290
So I was able to continue studying the Bible and get baptized.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.150
Leta was also doing the same.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.549
In 1960, I was attending a nursing college.

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:28.049
There, a nurse shared some interesting thoughts with me from the Bible.

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.750
Ten other student nurses also showed interest,

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.450
but the college threatened us with dismissal

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.650
because there was a ban on Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.950
When we were shown from the Bible why true Christians are persecuted,

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.549
we renewed our determination.

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.950
Eventually, five of us were baptized.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.950
In time, I met Stefana and we were married in 1964.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.750
Because of the ban, the brothers were meeting in small groups.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.750
Our trust was in Jehovah,

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.349
and we made the preaching work a matter of prayer,

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:09.650
confident that he would help us.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:14.949
We saw evidence of this with the underground production of the watchtower.

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:17.050
Our brothers would have modest means,

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.750
but they used what they had to buy a hand-operated duplicating machine

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.750
which was used in our home.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.250
After returning from our second work,

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.750
Leta and I would get busy making copies of the watchtower.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.780
We would play music, so our neighbors wouldn't hear the sound of the duplicator.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.180
In 1974, Emperor Haile Selassie was deposed.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.780
This communist government quickly began a campaign called Red Terror

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.280
against any supposed political opposer.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.379
Now, just having a typewriter or a duplicating machine

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:57.289
could put you in prison or even have you killed.

00:02:57.289 --> 00:03:01.490
Picking up a paper from the street with something printed on it against the government

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.189
could put one's life in danger.

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:07.689
It was common for people to disappear.

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:12.490
Sadly, my youngest brother, Eob, was a victim.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:21.620
He disappeared on his way home and was never seen again.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.919
With the situation being very dangerous,

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:29.719
we were quite concerned raising our daughter Janet.

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:32.419
But as we fully trusted in Jehovah,

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:35.419
we felt his loving protection.

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:39.919
From time to time, sections of the city were suddenly blockaded.

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:46.919
This happened one morning as a translator was heading to our home to deliver stencils for printing.

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:52.919
Urgently, he telephoned informing us that a house to house search was underway.

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.919
Our house was full of publications,

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:59.919
along with the duplicator and typewriters.

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:06.620
Just after the phone call, three soldiers entered our compound to search.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.819
At that moment, I prayed silently that Jehovah would blind them.

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:18.120
Entering the room where the duplicator and stacks of freshly printed literature were,

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.620
one soldier asked, what is all this?

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.620
All this is a duplicator that we use to print these Bible materials.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.819
Completing his search, he went outside to the commander, who asked him,

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:37.819
what did you find? To our utter amazement, after seeing everything, he answered,

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:41.819
nothing. We won't find anything here.

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:45.220
In the late 1970s and into the early 80s,

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.620
another wave of vicious persecution occurred.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:54.420
A number of faithful brothers were imprisoned, tortured, and murdered.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:00.819
I was taken from my workplace because of my neutral stand and put in prison.

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:04.220
When I think about living through those difficult times,

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.819
I'm reminded of Isaiah 54, 17, where Jehovah promised us,

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:15.939
no weapon formed against you will have any success.

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:20.139
Finally, in 1991, a liberal government came to power.

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:25.870
They gave us legal recognition and freedom of worship.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.069
With these difficult, dangerous years now behind us,

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:36.829
we were assigned to the circuit work in Eritrea and Ethiopia.

00:05:36.829 --> 00:05:39.829
By now, Eritrea was becoming an independent country,

00:05:39.829 --> 00:05:42.829
and this brought about new challenges for the brothers.

00:05:42.829 --> 00:05:47.829
Some young brothers were arrested and imprisoned because of their Christian stand.

00:05:47.829 --> 00:05:50.829
Paul wrote at Hebrews 13, verse 3,

00:05:50.829 --> 00:05:55.829
keep in mind those in prison, as though you were in prison with them.

00:05:55.829 --> 00:05:59.829
After enjoying the circuit work for 15 years,

00:05:59.829 --> 00:06:01.829
we faced another change.

00:06:01.829 --> 00:06:06.829
We were invited to serve at Bethel as full-time commuters.

00:06:06.829 --> 00:06:10.829
What has helped us to endure through the ban years,

00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:15.829
and to adjust to the many changes, is our spiritual study program.

00:06:15.829 --> 00:06:20.829
We're in full agreement with Jeremiah 17, verse 7.

00:06:20.829 --> 00:06:25.829
Blessed is the man who puts his trust in Jehovah.

00:06:25.829 --> 00:06:30.829
It also brings us much happiness to know that our daughter Janet

00:06:30.829 --> 00:06:35.829
has been serving as a regular pioneer for 20 years now.

00:06:35.829 --> 00:06:37.829
Each assignment has had its challenges,

00:06:37.829 --> 00:06:40.829
but many rewards and blessings.

00:06:40.829 --> 00:06:44.829
I'm not young anymore. I'm 77 years old.

00:06:44.829 --> 00:06:46.829
And I'm 74 years old.

00:06:46.829 --> 00:06:49.829
We are now serving as special pioneers.

00:06:49.829 --> 00:06:53.829
When we think about all the changes that we've been through,

00:06:53.829 --> 00:06:56.829
we realize that the words of Isaiah 6, verse 8,

00:06:56.829 --> 00:07:00.829
here I am, send me, are not just for young people,

00:07:00.829 --> 00:07:02.829
but for all of us.
