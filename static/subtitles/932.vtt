00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:29.059
There is an ongoing need for volunteers at Bethel and non-theocratic construction projects.

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:36.060
Although the COVID-19 pandemic has limited the number of those who may be invited at this time,

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.060
there is still a need for volunteers.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:49.060
As you watch the following video, please note the spirit displayed by those who make themselves available for Bethel service.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:59.750
Making yourself available for Bethel service is like knocking on a door that leads to many other privileges of service.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:13.750
Of course, to serve at Bethel requires a self-sacrificing spirit and a willingness to serve wherever there is a need in harmony with the attitude displayed by the prophet Isaiah at Isaiah 6.8.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.750
Then I heard the voice of Jehovah saying,

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.750
whom shall I send? And who will go for us? And I said,

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.750
here I am, send me.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:32.750
When Isaiah learned about an opportunity to do more in Jehovah's service, he responded eagerly,

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.750
even though he did not know exactly what he was going to be assigned to do.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.750
It was enough for him to know that Jehovah was extending an invitation to serve in a special way,

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.750
and Isaiah wanted to volunteer.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.750
The same spirit is shown by Bethel family members worldwide.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:02:00.319
If the branch committee determines that there is a need for your services, they will decide where you can best be used,

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:05.319
whether it Bethel or perhaps on the Theocratic construction assignment.

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:14.319
Submitting your application may open a door of opportunity to serve Jehovah and his organization in a variety of ways.

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:20.009
That was an excerpt from the video,

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:24.009
making yourself available for Bethel's service.

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:32.009
If you are interested in serving at Bethel or on Theocratic construction projects on a part-time or a full-time basis,

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:37.009
please watch the entire video on JW.org.

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:46.009
Baptized Christians who are 19 years of age or older and are interested in volunteering should apply.

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:50.009
Speak to your congregation secretary for more information.

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:58.740
If possible, please submit your application electronically on JW.org.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:05.740
Have you ever found yourself in a situation where your peace was threatened? How did you handle it?

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:11.740
We can learn much from the faithful man, Jacob, about how to make peace.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.740
Please open your Bibles to Genesis chapter 26.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.740
And follow along as Brother Mark Sanderson, a member of the governing body,

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:29.740
applies the lessons in the dramatic Bible reading with the theme, Jacob, a man who loved peace.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:42.740
Have you ever been the victim of oppression or injustice?

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:49.740
Have you been angered by something someone is said or done? Who of us hasn't?

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:57.740
In situations like that, people who don't know Jehovah often react in a way that's far from peaceful.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.740
They retaliate, they fight, they hit back.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:09.740
But we know that Jehovah sees what happened, and he can set matters straight.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:19.740
We're wise to remember the words of Jesus. Happy are the mild tempered. Happy are the peacemakers.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:28.740
The Bible describes a man who remained mild and peaceable in some extremely difficult and stressful situations.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:36.740
Repeatedly, he chose not to fight, preferring a course that led to peace.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:46.740
That man was Jacob. Jacob learned from the peaceful example of his father, Isaac.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:56.740
There was a famine in the land, and Isaac moved his family to Giroir, which was ruled by Abimolek, king of the Philistines.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:02.740
Let's read about the problems that arose and see how Isaac dealt with them.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.740
Please turn to Genesis chapter 26 and verse 12.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:21.269
And Isaac began to so seed in that land, and in that year he reaped 100 times what he sowed, for Jehovah was blessing him.

00:05:21.269 --> 00:05:28.269
The man became wealthy, and he continued to prosper until he became very wealthy.

00:05:28.269 --> 00:05:39.269
He acquired flocks of sheep and herds of cattle and a large body of servants, and the Philistines began to envy him.

00:05:39.269 --> 00:05:48.269
So the Philistines took soil and stopped up all the wells that his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham.

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:51.269
Abimolek then said to Isaac,

00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:56.269
move from our neighborhood, for you have grown far stronger than we are.

00:05:56.269 --> 00:06:04.269
So Isaac moved from there, and encamped in the valley of Giroir, and began dwelling there.

00:06:04.269 --> 00:06:15.269
And Isaac again dug the wells that had been dug in the days of his father Abraham, but that the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham's death,

00:06:15.269 --> 00:06:20.269
and he called them by the names that his father had given them.

00:06:20.269 --> 00:06:33.269
When the servants of Isaac were digging in the valley, they found a well of fresh water, and the shepherds of Giroir began quarreling with the shepherds of Isaac, saying,

00:06:33.269 --> 00:06:36.269
the water is ours.

00:06:36.269 --> 00:06:47.269
So he named the well Isaac, because they had quarreled with him, and they started digging another well, and they began quarreling over it also.

00:06:47.269 --> 00:06:50.269
So he named it Sitna.

00:06:50.269 --> 00:06:57.269
Later he moved away from there and dug another well, but they did not quarrel over it.

00:06:57.269 --> 00:07:01.269
So he named it Rahoboth, and said,

00:07:01.269 --> 00:07:08.269
it is because now Jehovah has given us ample room, and has made us fruitful in the land.

00:07:08.269 --> 00:07:12.269
Then he went up from there to bear Shiba.

00:07:12.269 --> 00:07:16.269
That night, Jehovah appeared to him and said,

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:19.269
I am the God of your father Abraham.

00:07:19.269 --> 00:07:30.269
Do not be afraid, for I am with you, and I will bless you, and multiply your offspring on account of Abraham my servant.

00:07:31.269 --> 00:07:43.269
The Philistines, motivated by envy, stop up all the wells that Abraham had dug, and the king asks Isaac to move from the neighborhood.

00:07:43.269 --> 00:07:46.269
Isaac now has a decision to make.

00:07:46.269 --> 00:07:49.269
Perhaps some encourage him to stay put.

00:07:49.269 --> 00:07:52.269
Think about how they might have reasoned.

00:07:52.269 --> 00:07:55.269
You have done nothing wrong, Isaac.

00:07:55.269 --> 00:08:00.269
Jehovah told you that you and your offspring would possess the land.

00:08:00.269 --> 00:08:03.269
You have nothing to fear.

00:08:03.269 --> 00:08:08.269
You have many servants, and they are stronger than the Philistines.

00:08:08.269 --> 00:08:14.269
Why not hit back against those who have done this to your wells?

00:08:14.269 --> 00:08:19.269
In this situation, what would you have done?

00:08:19.269 --> 00:08:23.269
Isaac chooses a peaceful course.

00:08:23.269 --> 00:08:26.269
He decides to move on.

00:08:26.269 --> 00:08:29.269
This is not easy.

00:08:29.269 --> 00:08:36.269
Isaac has many servants, and flocks of sheep, and herds of cattle.

00:08:36.269 --> 00:08:42.269
He has tilled the ground, planted seed, and it is produced plentifully.

00:08:42.269 --> 00:08:48.269
But he leaves that behind, and moves on.

00:08:48.269 --> 00:08:52.269
But Isaac's troubles are not over.

00:08:52.269 --> 00:08:58.269
In his new location, his servants dig wells, and find fresh water.

00:08:58.269 --> 00:09:04.269
But the shepherds in that area say, the water is ours.

00:09:04.269 --> 00:09:11.269
Isaac then digs another well, but the local shepherds quarrel about that one too.

00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:17.269
Again, instead of fighting over the matter, Isaac moves.

00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:24.269
And finally, finds a place where he can reside in peace.

00:09:24.269 --> 00:09:30.269
Jacob saw that his father's peaceful actions had a good effect,

00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:35.269
and he knew that Isaac had received Jehovah's blessing.

00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:38.269
What's the lesson?

00:09:38.269 --> 00:09:45.269
Parents never underestimate the powerful effect your good example

00:09:45.269 --> 00:09:49.269
can have on your children.

00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:52.269
Jacob has a twin brother, Esau.

00:09:52.269 --> 00:09:56.269
Of the two, Esau is born first.

00:09:56.269 --> 00:10:00.269
But Jehovah foretells that contrary to custom,

00:10:00.269 --> 00:10:05.269
the older Esau will serve his younger brother.

00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:10.269
Jehovah foresees what kind of personalities they'll develop.

00:10:10.269 --> 00:10:17.269
And he knows that Esau will have little appreciation for spiritual matters.

00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:23.269
This becomes evident when Esau exchanges his right as firstborn

00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:30.269
for a mere bowl of stew, sealing the matter with an oath.

00:10:30.269 --> 00:10:33.269
But something more is involved.

00:10:33.269 --> 00:10:38.269
In selling the birthright, he also gives up the right

00:10:38.269 --> 00:10:42.269
to receive a prophetic blessing from his father.

00:10:42.269 --> 00:10:47.269
Years pass, Isaac has grown old,

00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:52.269
and he decides it's time to impart the blessing to his firstborn.

00:10:52.269 --> 00:10:57.269
He may not know that Esau had sold his right as firstborn.

00:10:57.269 --> 00:11:02.269
In any case, he tells Esau that he will bless him,

00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:07.269
but asks him first to provide him with a tasty dish,

00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:11.269
a fresh game from the field.

00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:16.269
Rebecca, the twin's mother overhears this conversation

00:11:16.269 --> 00:11:21.269
and persuades Jacob to impersonate his twin brother

00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:24.269
while Esau is out hunting.

00:11:24.269 --> 00:11:27.269
The plan is successful.

00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:31.269
Isaac unwittingly blesses Jacob.

00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:35.269
Esau, at learning of this, is furious.

00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:42.269
Let's take up the account from Genesis chapter 27 and verse 41.

00:11:42.269 --> 00:11:47.269
However, Esau harbored animosity against Jacob

00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:51.269
because of the blessing his father had given him,

00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:54.269
and Esau kept saying in his heart,

00:11:54.269 --> 00:11:59.269
the days of mourning for my father are getting closer.

00:11:59.269 --> 00:12:03.269
After that, I am going to kill Jacob, my brother.

00:12:03.269 --> 00:12:08.269
When the words of her older son, Esau, were told to Rebecca,

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:13.269
she at once sent for her younger son, Jacob, and said to him,

00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:18.269
Look, your brother, Esau, is planning to take revenge by killing you.

00:12:18.269 --> 00:12:23.269
Now, my son, do as I say, get up and run away

00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:25.269
to my brother, Leban at Heran,

00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:31.269
dwell with him for a while until your brother's rage calms down,

00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:35.269
until your brother's anger towards you subsides,

00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:38.269
and he forgets what you have done to him.

00:12:38.269 --> 00:12:41.269
Then I will send for you from there.

00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:46.269
Why should I lose both of you in one day?

00:12:46.269 --> 00:12:50.269
After that, Rebecca kept saying to Isaac,

00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:55.269
I am disgusted with my life because of the daughters of Hath.

00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:58.269
If Jacob ever takes a wife from the daughters of Hath

00:12:58.269 --> 00:13:03.269
like these daughters of the land, what good is my life?

00:13:03.269 --> 00:13:08.269
So Isaac called Jacob and blessed him and commanded him,

00:13:08.269 --> 00:13:13.269
saying, You must not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan.

00:13:13.269 --> 00:13:18.269
Go away to Patan A. Ram, to the house of Bethuel, your mother's father,

00:13:18.269 --> 00:13:22.269
and from there take for yourself a wife from the daughters of Leban,

00:13:22.269 --> 00:13:24.269
your mother's brother.

00:13:24.269 --> 00:13:29.269
God Almighty will bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you,

00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:33.269
and you will certainly become a congregation of peoples,

00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:36.269
and He will give to you the blessing of Abraham,

00:13:36.269 --> 00:13:39.269
to you and to your offspring with you,

00:13:39.269 --> 00:13:41.269
so that you may take possession of the land

00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:44.269
where you have been living as a foreigner,

00:13:44.269 --> 00:13:47.269
which God has given to Abraham.

00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:50.269
So Isaac sent Jacob away,

00:13:50.269 --> 00:13:53.269
and he departed for Patan A. Ram to Leban,

00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:56.269
the son of Bethuel, the Aramean,

00:13:56.269 --> 00:14:01.269
the brother of Rebecca, the mother of Jacob and Issa.

00:14:01.269 --> 00:14:06.269
Jacob's parents tell him to travel to his uncle, Leban,

00:14:06.269 --> 00:14:08.269
to find a wife.

00:14:08.269 --> 00:14:13.269
Of course, the core issue is the problem with Issa.

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:15.269
Recall that earlier,

00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:18.269
Isaac had a problem with the Philistines,

00:14:18.269 --> 00:14:23.269
a problem that evidently could not be settled peacefully.

00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:26.269
So what did Isaac do?

00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:29.269
He moved on.

00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:32.269
Now Jacob faces a similar situation.

00:14:32.269 --> 00:14:36.269
His brother is seething with anger.

00:14:36.269 --> 00:14:39.269
So Jacob leaves.

00:14:39.269 --> 00:14:43.269
It means leaving his home and his family.

00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:49.269
It means making a long journey to a distant land.

00:14:49.269 --> 00:14:52.269
Jacob could have chosen to stand his ground.

00:14:52.269 --> 00:14:55.269
He owns the birthright.

00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:58.269
He could argue the matter with his father and mother.

00:14:58.269 --> 00:15:03.269
I'm no child. I'm 77 years old.

00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:06.269
Jacob does none of those things.

00:15:06.269 --> 00:15:08.269
The Bible simply says,

00:15:08.269 --> 00:15:14.269
Jacob obeyed his father and his mother and departed.

00:15:14.269 --> 00:15:16.269
What's the lesson?

00:15:16.269 --> 00:15:21.269
When we face a situation that can't be settled peacefully,

00:15:21.269 --> 00:15:27.269
we probably won't need to flee for our lives to a distant land.

00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:35.269
Sometimes, however, it is the course of wisdom to walk away from a situation.

00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:39.269
Proverbs chapter 17 and verse 14 says,

00:15:39.269 --> 00:15:44.269
beginning a fight is like opening a floodgate.

00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:50.269
Before the quarrel breaks out, take your leave.

00:15:50.269 --> 00:15:53.269
While Jacob is on his way to his uncle,

00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:56.269
Jehovah appears to Jacob in a dream

00:15:56.269 --> 00:16:02.269
and assures him of his support and protection.

00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:07.269
That does not mean that Jacob's troubles are over.

00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:09.269
At the journey's end,

00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:12.269
he moves in with his uncle's household.

00:16:12.269 --> 00:16:21.269
In time, a situation rises again that shows that Jacob is a man who loves peace.

00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:28.940
Let's read about it from Genesis chapter 29 and verse 16.

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:31.940
Now, Laban had two daughters.

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:33.940
The name of the older was Leah,

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:36.940
and the name of the younger Rachel.

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:40.940
But the eyes of Leah had no luster,

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:45.940
whereas Rachel had become a very attractive and beautiful woman.

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:48.940
Jacob had fallen in love with Rachel,

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:50.940
so he said,

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:55.940
I am willing to serve you seven years for your younger daughter, Rachel.

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:57.940
To this, Laban said,

00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:02.940
it is better for me to give her to you than to give her to another man,

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:04.940
keep dwelling with me.

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:08.940
And Jacob served seven years for Rachel.

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:12.940
But in his eyes, they were like just a few days

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:15.940
because of his love for her.

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:18.940
Then, Jacob said to Laban,

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:21.940
give over my wife because my days are up,

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:24.940
and let me have relations with her.

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:29.940
With that, Laban gathered all the men of the place and made a feast.

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:34.940
But during the evening, he resorted to taking his daughter, Leah,

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:39.940
and bringing her to him that he might have relations with her.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:43.940
Laban also gave his female servant, Zilpa,

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:46.940
to his daughter, Leah, as a servant.

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:51.940
In the morning, Jacob saw that it was Leah.

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:53.940
So he said to Laban,

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.940
what have you done to me?

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:58.940
Was it not for Rachel that I served you?

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:00.940
Why have you tricked me?

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.940
To this, Laban said,

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:08.940
it is not our custom here to give the younger woman before the firstborn,

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:11.940
celebrate the week of this woman.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:18.940
After that, you will also be given this other woman in exchange for serving me seven more years.

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:22.940
Jacob did so and celebrated the week of this woman

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:27.940
after which he gave him his daughter, Rachel, as a wife.

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.940
Besides, Laban gave his female servant, Bilha,

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:33.940
to his daughter, Rachel, as her servant.

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:38.279
Jacob has reason to be upset.

00:18:38.279 --> 00:18:44.279
He had arranged with Laban to work seven years for Rachel.

00:18:44.279 --> 00:18:47.279
At the end of the seven years,

00:18:47.279 --> 00:18:49.279
a wedding feast is arranged.

00:18:50.279 --> 00:18:55.279
But the heavily veiled woman brought into him is not Rachel.

00:18:55.279 --> 00:18:57.279
It's Leah.

00:18:57.279 --> 00:19:02.279
Imagine how shocked Jacob must have been.

00:19:02.279 --> 00:19:05.279
Instead of admitting to his deceit,

00:19:05.279 --> 00:19:08.279
Laban gives an excuse.

00:19:08.279 --> 00:19:11.279
What thoughts come to Jacob's mind?

00:19:11.279 --> 00:19:16.279
Does he consider that Jehovah might be working out his promise

00:19:16.279 --> 00:19:19.279
to make Jacob's offspring plentiful,

00:19:19.279 --> 00:19:22.279
like the dust particles of the earth?

00:19:22.279 --> 00:19:24.279
We don't know.

00:19:24.279 --> 00:19:26.279
As it turns out,

00:19:26.279 --> 00:19:29.279
Leah bears him six sons,

00:19:29.279 --> 00:19:32.279
including Levi and Judah,

00:19:32.279 --> 00:19:38.279
family heads of the two most honored tribes of Israel.

00:19:38.279 --> 00:19:41.279
Of course, Jacob couldn't have foreknown this.

00:19:41.279 --> 00:19:43.279
Still,

00:19:43.279 --> 00:19:47.279
Jacob the peacemaker accepts Leah

00:19:47.279 --> 00:19:51.279
and goes along with Laban's outrageous request

00:19:51.279 --> 00:19:57.279
that he worked an additional seven years for Rachel.

00:19:57.279 --> 00:19:59.279
What's the lesson?

00:19:59.279 --> 00:20:05.279
It's disappointing when others don't hold to their agreements.

00:20:05.279 --> 00:20:07.279
Like Jacob,

00:20:07.279 --> 00:20:11.279
can we find it in our hearts to forgive

00:20:11.279 --> 00:20:14.279
and find a way to preserve peace with them?

00:20:14.279 --> 00:20:21.849
Jacob serves Laban for fourteen years for his two wives.

00:20:21.849 --> 00:20:27.849
And he works for Laban another six years for a flock of his own.

00:20:27.849 --> 00:20:30.849
Finally, at Jehovah's direction,

00:20:30.849 --> 00:20:34.849
he gathers his family along with his animals

00:20:34.849 --> 00:20:39.849
and without informing Laban, he leaves for home.

00:20:39.849 --> 00:20:43.849
When Laban learns of this, he is furious.

00:20:43.849 --> 00:20:47.849
He chases and catches up with Jacob.

00:20:47.849 --> 00:20:50.849
This is a dangerous situation,

00:20:50.849 --> 00:20:54.849
one that can easily turn violent.

00:20:54.849 --> 00:20:57.849
Imagine how it might have been.

00:20:57.849 --> 00:21:00.849
Jacob had come to a mountainous region,

00:21:00.849 --> 00:21:02.849
possibly its morning,

00:21:02.849 --> 00:21:05.849
and the air is cool.

00:21:05.849 --> 00:21:08.849
There are the sounds and smells of animals,

00:21:08.849 --> 00:21:11.849
sheep, donkeys, camels.

00:21:11.849 --> 00:21:13.849
There are many.

00:21:13.849 --> 00:21:16.849
The servants attend to them,

00:21:16.849 --> 00:21:19.849
getting them ready for the day's journey.

00:21:19.849 --> 00:21:23.849
But then, come cries of alarm.

00:21:23.849 --> 00:21:26.849
Laban has come, and he's not alone.

00:21:26.849 --> 00:21:29.849
He arrives with strong men.

00:21:29.849 --> 00:21:31.849
They gallop in on camels.

00:21:31.849 --> 00:21:33.849
They dismount.

00:21:33.849 --> 00:21:37.849
This is not a friendly visit.

00:21:37.849 --> 00:21:42.849
Laban's men are ready to obey orders from Laban.

00:21:42.849 --> 00:21:45.849
Jacob's servants quickly gather to the scene.

00:21:45.849 --> 00:21:51.849
All eyes are fixed on Laban and Jacob who argue.

00:21:51.849 --> 00:21:53.849
The previous night,

00:21:53.849 --> 00:21:56.849
Jehovah had warned Laban in a dream

00:21:56.849 --> 00:22:00.849
to be careful about what he'd say to Jacob.

00:22:00.849 --> 00:22:06.849
Still, Laban is angry and aggressive.

00:22:06.849 --> 00:22:09.849
Laban makes two charges.

00:22:09.849 --> 00:22:11.849
First, he says,

00:22:11.849 --> 00:22:14.849
Why have you resorted to outwitting me

00:22:14.849 --> 00:22:19.849
and carrying my daughters off like captives taken by the sword?

00:22:19.849 --> 00:22:26.849
Why did you run away secretly and outwit me and not tell me?

00:22:26.849 --> 00:22:29.849
The answer to that charge is obvious.

00:22:29.849 --> 00:22:31.849
Jacob replies,

00:22:31.849 --> 00:22:34.849
It was because I was afraid,

00:22:34.849 --> 00:22:36.849
I said to myself,

00:22:36.849 --> 00:22:40.849
You might take your daughters away from me by force.

00:22:40.849 --> 00:22:46.849
Laban also charges that Jacob has stolen his household gods.

00:22:46.849 --> 00:22:50.849
Rachel has indeed stolen the gods,

00:22:50.849 --> 00:22:53.849
but Jacob knows nothing about this.

00:22:53.849 --> 00:22:55.849
A search is made,

00:22:55.849 --> 00:22:58.849
but the idols are not found.

00:22:58.849 --> 00:23:01.849
Jacob then makes his defense.

00:23:01.849 --> 00:23:06.849
Let's take up our reading at Genesis chapter 31 and verse 36.

00:23:06.849 --> 00:23:10.450
At that,

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:14.450
Jacob became angry and began to criticize Laban.

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:17.450
Jacob then said to Laban,

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:19.450
What is my offense?

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:22.450
And for what sin are you hotly pursuing me?

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:25.450
Now that you have searched through all my goods,

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:28.450
what have you found that belongs to your house?

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:31.450
Put it here in front of my brothers and your brothers

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:35.450
and let them decide between the two of us.

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:38.450
During these twenty years that I have been with you,

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:42.450
your sheep and your goats never miscarried,

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:45.450
and I never ate the rams of your flock.

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:49.450
I did not bring you any animal torn by wild beasts.

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:52.450
I would stand the loss of it myself.

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:55.450
Whether the animal was stolen by day,

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:57.450
or was stolen by night,

00:23:57.450 --> 00:24:00.450
you would demand compensation from me.

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:03.450
By day, the heat consumed me,

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:05.450
and the cold by night,

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:08.450
and sleep would flee from my eyes.

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:12.450
This makes twenty years for me in your house.

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:16.450
I have served you fourteen years for your two daughters,

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:18.450
and six years for your flock,

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:22.450
and you kept changing my wages ten times.

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:25.450
If the God of my Father,

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:27.450
the God of Abraham,

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:31.450
whom Isaac fears had not been on my side,

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:35.450
you would now have sent me away empty handed.

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:37.450
God has seen my affliction,

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:39.450
and the toil of my hands,

00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:42.450
and that is why he reproved you last night.

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:45.450
Then, Laban answered Jacob.

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:47.450
The daughters are my daughters,

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:49.450
and the children, my children,

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:51.450
and the flock, my flock,

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:55.450
and everything you are looking at is mine.

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:58.450
And my daughters,

00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:00.450
what can I do today against these

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:04.450
or against their children whom they have born?

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:07.450
Now come, let us make a covenant,

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:08.450
you and I,

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:12.450
and it will serve as a witness between us.

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:14.450
So Jacob took a stone

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:16.450
and set it up as a pillar.

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:19.450
Then Jacob said to his brothers,

00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:21.450
pick up stones,

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:24.450
and they took stones and made a pile,

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:26.450
after that,

00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:29.450
they ate there on the pile of stones.

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:33.450
And Laban began calling at Jigarse Hadootha,

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:36.450
but Jacob called a galliad.

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:38.450
Laban then said,

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:40.450
This pile of stones is a witness

00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:43.450
between me and you today.

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:46.450
That is why he named it galliad,

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:48.450
and the watchtower,

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:49.450
for he said,

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:53.450
Let Jehovah keep watch between you and me

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:56.450
when we are out of each other's sight.

00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:58.450
If you mistreat my daughters,

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:00.450
and if you start taking wives

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:02.450
in addition to my daughters,

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:04.450
though there is no man with us,

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:07.450
remember that God will be a witness

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:09.450
between you and me.

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:12.450
Laban went on to say to Jacob,

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:15.450
Here is this pile of stones,

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:17.450
and here is the pillar

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:20.450
that I have erected between you and me.

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:23.450
This pile of stones is a witness,

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:26.450
and the pillar is something that bears witness,

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:29.450
that I will not pass beyond this pile of stones

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:31.450
to bring harm to you,

00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:34.450
and you will not pass beyond this pile of stones

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:37.450
and this pillar to bring harm to me.

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:40.450
Let the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor,

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:42.450
the God of their Father,

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:45.450
judge between us.

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:50.450
And Jacob swore by the one whom his father Isaac fears.

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:52.450
After that,

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:55.450
Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain

00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:58.450
and invited his brothers to eat bread,

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:02.450
so they ate and spent the night in the mountain.

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:05.450
However, Laban got up early in the morning

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:08.450
and kissed his grandchildren and his daughters

00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:10.450
and blessed them.

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:17.170
Then Laban departed and returned home.

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:22.170
Jacob had served Laban faithfully for 20 years,

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:26.170
even though Laban had defrauded and exploited him.

00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:28.170
Laban doesn't acknowledge that,

00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:31.170
but rather dishonestly claims

00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:36.170
that he is the rightful owner of all that Jacob has with him.

00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:41.170
Laban then suggests that they make a covenant of peace,

00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:46.170
ensuring that neither family will bring harm to the other.

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:50.170
Laban's motive is not that he loves peace.

00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:54.170
It might have been to ensure that Jacob will not return

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:57.170
with the household gods after Laban's death

00:27:57.170 --> 00:28:01.170
to deprive his sons of their inheritance.

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:04.170
In any case, Jacob agrees.

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:07.170
Everyone relaxes.

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:09.170
There's to be no violence

00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:15.170
and a monument is set up to memorialize the agreement.

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:19.170
Despite the many years of oppression,

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:23.170
Jacob agrees to a covenant of peace.

00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:28.170
He does not harbor resentment or seek revenge.

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:32.170
That crisis is over for Jacob.

00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:36.170
But now, another one looms.

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:39.170
Jacob sends messengers to his brother.

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:42.170
They say that Jacob is returning

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:45.170
and that he seeks Esau's favor.

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:48.170
The messengers return with the news

00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:51.170
that Esau is on his way to meet him

00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:54.170
and with him are 400 men.

00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:56.170
Oh my!

00:28:56.170 --> 00:28:59.170
Is Esau still angry?

00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:02.170
Understandably, Jacob is worried.

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:06.170
He does not want to fight with his brother.

00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:09.170
Let us see how he handles the situation.

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:14.170
Please turn to Genesis chapter 32 and verse 13.

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:19.700
And he spent the night there.

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:22.700
Then he took some of his possessions

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:25.700
as a gift for Esau his brother.

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:28.700
200 female goats.

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:30.700
20 male goats.

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:32.700
200 female sheep.

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:34.700
20 rams.

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:37.700
30 camels nursing their young.

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:39.700
40 cows.

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:41.700
10 bulls.

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:43.700
20 female dokeys.

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:47.700
And 10 full grown male dokeys.

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:50.700
He handed them over to his servants.

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:52.700
One drove after another.

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:55.700
And he said to his servants.

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:57.700
Cross over ahead of me.

00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:02.700
And you were to set a space between one drove and the next.

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.700
He also commanded the first one.

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:08.700
In case Esau my brother should meet you and ask,

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:10.700
to whom do you belong?

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:12.700
And where are you going?

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:14.700
And to whom did these ahead of you belong?

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:16.700
Then you should say,

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:18.700
to your servant Jacob,

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:21.700
it is a gift sent to my Lord,

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:22.700
to Esau.

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:26.700
And look, he himself is also behind us.

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:29.700
And he commanded also the second,

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:33.700
the third, and all those following the drools.

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:35.700
According to this word,

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:38.700
you are to speak to Esau when you meet him.

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:40.700
And you should also say,

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:44.700
here is your servant Jacob behind us.

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:47.700
Before he said to himself,

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:51.700
if I appease him by sending a gift ahead of me,

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:54.700
then afterward when I see him,

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:57.700
he may give me a kindly reception.

00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:03.390
Jacob wants peaceful relations with his brother.

00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:06.390
He sends a generous gift,

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:08.390
hundreds of animals,

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:10.390
to help make that possible.

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:12.390
Was Jacob weak-minded,

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:16.390
too cowardly to stand up to his brother?

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:17.390
Not at all.

00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:20.390
Why, as the time neared for the meeting with Esau,

00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:24.390
Jacob wrestles with an angel until dawn,

00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:28.390
to receive further assurance of Jehovah's blessing.

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:33.390
Let's now see what happens when the two brothers meet.

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:40.440
Please turn to Genesis chapter 33 and verse 1.

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:45.440
Now Jacob raised his eyes and saw Esau coming,

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:49.440
and 400 men were with him.

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:53.440
So he divided the children among Leah, Rachel,

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:56.440
and the two female servants.

00:31:56.440 --> 00:32:00.440
He put the female servants and their children in front.

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:03.440
Leah and her children after them,

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:06.440
and Rachel and Joseph behind them,

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:09.440
then he himself went ahead of them

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:13.440
and bowed down to the earth seven times,

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:16.440
as he came near to his brother.

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:19.440
But Esau ran to meet him,

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:22.440
and he embraced him and kissed him,

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:25.440
and they burst into tears.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:30.440
When he raised his eyes and saw the women and the children,

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.440
he said,

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.440
Who are these with you?

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:35.440
To which he said,

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:39.440
The children with whom God has favored your servant.

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:44.440
At that, the female servants came forward with their children,

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:46.440
and bowed down.

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:49.440
And Leah too came forward with her children,

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.440
and they bowed down.

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:54.440
Then Joseph came forward with Rachel,

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:57.440
and they bowed down.

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.440
Esau said,

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:03.440
What is the purpose of all this camp of travelers that I have met?

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.440
He replied,

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:08.440
in order to find favor in the eyes of my Lord.

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:10.440
Then Esau said,

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:14.440
I have a great many possessions, my brother.

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:17.440
Keep what is yours.

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.440
However, Jacob said,

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:22.440
No, please.

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:25.440
If I have found favor in your eyes,

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:28.440
you must take my gift from my hand,

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:32.440
because I brought it so that I could see your face.

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:36.440
And I have seen your face,

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:38.440
as though seeing God's face,

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:41.440
in that you received me with pleasure.

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:44.440
Take, please,

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:48.440
the gift conveying my blessing that was brought to you.

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:51.440
For God has favored me,

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:54.440
and I have everything I need.

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:57.440
And he continued to urge him,

00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:02.329
so that he took it.

00:34:02.329 --> 00:34:04.329
What a happy outcome.

00:34:04.329 --> 00:34:07.329
Instead of an angry confrontation,

00:34:07.329 --> 00:34:10.329
there is a joyful reunion.

00:34:10.329 --> 00:34:12.329
The two men shed tears.

00:34:12.329 --> 00:34:15.329
They embrace again.

00:34:15.329 --> 00:34:18.329
Jacob is the peacemaker.

00:34:18.329 --> 00:34:20.329
How did he prove that?

00:34:20.329 --> 00:34:22.329
He prayed,

00:34:22.329 --> 00:34:25.329
and he acted in harmony with his prayers.

00:34:25.329 --> 00:34:27.329
He sent gifts.

00:34:27.329 --> 00:34:30.329
He showed honor and respect to his brother,

00:34:30.329 --> 00:34:32.329
calling him Lord,

00:34:32.329 --> 00:34:35.329
and bowing seven times.

00:34:35.329 --> 00:34:37.329
What's the lesson?

00:34:37.329 --> 00:34:43.329
Doesn't this account well illustrate the extent to which we should be willing to go

00:34:43.329 --> 00:34:47.329
to preserve peace with our Christian brothers and sisters?

00:34:47.329 --> 00:34:53.800
We learn so much about seeking peace from Jacob.

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.800
When threatened by his brother while living at home,

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.800
he moved away.

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:02.800
When deceived by Laban regarding Rachel and Leah,

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.800
he yielded.

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:07.800
When chased down and accused by Laban,

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:11.800
Jacob agreed to a covenant of peace.

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:14.800
And when confronting Esau,

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.800
he offered a gift.

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.800
Keep in mind,

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:23.800
in none of these situations was Jacob the one who needed to apologize,

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:26.800
yet throughout his life,

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.800
Jacob loved peace.

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:32.800
He relied on Jehovah

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:35.800
and Jehovah blessed him.

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.800
Jehovah never forgot Jacob

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.800
and how he pursued peace

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:43.800
in his dealings with others.

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.800
When we do the same,

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:50.800
when we pursue peace in the face of injustice,

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.800
in the face of persecution,

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:54.800
in small issues,

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.800
as well as in big issues.

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.800
Jehovah will not forget us either.

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:02.800
Jehovah will richly bless us

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.800
if we love peace

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:08.800
just as Jacob loved peace.

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:17.489
How comforting it is

00:36:17.489 --> 00:36:20.489
to reflect on Jehovah's love

00:36:20.489 --> 00:36:23.489
and support for those who make peace.

00:36:23.489 --> 00:36:28.489
This Bible account is filled with practical examples

00:36:28.489 --> 00:36:31.489
that each of us can imitate.

00:36:31.489 --> 00:36:33.489
You will be pleased to know

00:36:33.489 --> 00:36:35.489
that the dramatic Bible reading,

00:36:35.489 --> 00:36:38.489
Jacob, a man who loved peace,

00:36:38.489 --> 00:36:41.489
is now available for download

00:36:41.489 --> 00:36:43.489
on the JW.org website

00:36:43.489 --> 00:36:50.750
and in the JW Library app.

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:53.750
How can we maintain our God-given peace

00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:57.750
despite living in an ungodly world?

00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:59.750
Please pay close attention

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:01.750
to Brother David Schaeffer,

00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:03.750
a helper to the teaching committee.

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:06.750
As he answers this question in the talk,

00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:19.460
the result of true righteousness will be peace.

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:21.460
Earlier, we considered the expression

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:23.460
at Philippians 4.7,

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:27.460
the peace of God that surpasses all understanding.

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:29.460
That is, the tranquility

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:31.460
and calmness we enjoy

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:34.460
because we have a close friendship with Jehovah.

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:37.460
What a remarkable blessing.

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:40.460
But although we enjoy God-given peace,

00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:42.460
our life in this system of things

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:45.460
is not problem-free, is it?

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:47.460
Psalm 34 19 acknowledges as much

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:48.460
when it says,

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:52.460
many are the hardships of the righteous one.

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:57.460
But Jehovah rescues him from them all.

00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:00.460
We may experience family opposition,

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:03.460
persecution, war, natural disasters,

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:05.460
or severe illnesses.

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:07.460
But none of these hardships

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:10.460
can separate us from God's love.

00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:11.460
Neither death nor life,

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:12.460
nor angels, nor governments,

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:13.460
nor things now here,

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:14.460
nor things to come.

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:16.460
None of these things can rob us

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:20.460
of the peace Jehovah gives.

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:25.460
And yet there is something that can.

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:31.460
Please turn with me to Isaiah chapter 32, verse 17.

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:33.460
And as we read this text,

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:37.460
notice that it refers to peace as a result.

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:40.460
Do you think of peace that way as a result?

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:43.460
If peace is a result,

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:45.460
what causes it?

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:49.460
Isaiah 32, 17.

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:54.460
The result of true righteousness

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:56.460
will be peace.

00:38:56.460 --> 00:39:00.460
And the fruitage of true righteousness

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:05.460
will be lasting tranquility and security.

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:07.460
What a beautiful expression,

00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:11.460
lasting tranquility and security.

00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:15.460
Again, from what does it result?

00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:17.460
True righteousness.

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:19.460
What if righteousness no longer mattered to us?

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:22.460
What if a person concluded it makes no difference how I live

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:24.460
or what sacrifices I make?

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:26.460
If I'm going to suffer hardships either way,

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:29.460
I might as well do whatever I please while I can.

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:32.460
What's wrong with that thinking?

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:36.460
Would it show appreciation for peace

00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:39.460
and all that Jehovah has done to make it possible?

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:41.460
Peace is a result.

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:44.460
And behind every result is a cause.

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:46.460
If we want peace,

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:49.460
we have to pursue righteousness.

00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:53.460
An unrighteous person cannot be at peace with God.

00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:58.460
Serious transgressions put a strain on a person's relationship with God.

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:03.460
King David's words found at Psalm 38-3,

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:07.460
sensing Jehovah's disapproval, he wrote,

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:11.460
there is no peace within my bones

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:14.460
because of my sin.

00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:18.460
Inevitably, the unrighteous person will reap what he sows

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:22.460
and lose his peace.

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:24.460
What is righteousness?

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:27.460
And how do we pursue it?

00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:30.460
Righteousness is what we have or what we show

00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:33.460
when we do what is right according to Jehovah's standards.

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:36.460
And those standards are not just rules we follow

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:40.460
but principles that guide the way we deal with each other.

00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:43.460
As universal sovereign and creator,

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:46.460
Jehovah God determines what is righteous.

00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:48.460
Isn't that what was represented by the tree

00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:51.460
of the knowledge of good and bad in the Garden of Eden?

00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:54.460
As a result of Jehovah's command to abstain from its fruit,

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:57.460
that tree represented God's right

00:40:57.460 --> 00:40:59.460
to determine for his creatures what is good

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:02.460
and what is bad for them.

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:05.460
And although Jehovah has given humans free will,

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:07.460
the right to choose,

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:10.460
he has not granted humans, not even perfect ones,

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:13.460
the right to set the standard for what is righteous

00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:15.460
and what is not.

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:19.460
Now notice once again that Isaiah 32-17 says

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:24.460
that the result of true righteousness will be peace.

00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:28.460
It uses that term twice, true righteousness.

00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:33.460
Not everything called righteousness is true righteousness.

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:36.460
Many people view righteousness as just a personal virtue

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:39.460
achieved by following the rules.

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:43.460
At Matthew 23-28, Jesus said that the Pharisees

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:45.460
appeared righteous on the outside,

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:48.460
but inside they were lawless.

00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:54.460
Ecclesiastes 7-16 talks about those who think their standards

00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:57.460
are more righteous even than gods.

00:41:57.460 --> 00:42:00.460
And at Romans 10-3, Paul talked about people

00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:05.460
who seek to establish their own righteousness.

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:08.460
But false piety over righteousness

00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:15.460
and self-righteousness are not what Isaiah 32-17 is talking about.

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:19.460
Today many argue for the acceptance of conduct

00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:21.460
that Jehovah forbids.

00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:24.460
They may even find support from a world

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:27.460
already alienated from God.

00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:30.460
But wide acceptance in a growing community

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:33.460
does not redefine righteousness.

00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:36.460
None of that is true righteousness.

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:39.460
Our loving creator sets the standard for what is right.

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:43.460
Not our feelings, not the community at large.

00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:46.460
Now while you're here in Isaiah,

00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:49.460
please turn to chapter 48.

00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:53.460
In order to be viewed as righteous,

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:56.460
we have to trust that Jehovah

00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:58.460
should set the standard of right and wrong.

00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:01.460
In addition, we must prove by our speech and actions

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:05.460
that we agree with Jehovah's standards and obey him.

00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:10.460
And that takes real courage in a wicked world.

00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:13.460
But when we do that, we enjoy the result.

00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:15.460
Notice what it says at Isaiah,

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:20.460
chapter 48 verses 17 and 18.

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:22.460
This is what Jehovah says.

00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:25.460
You are repurchaser.

00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:28.460
The holy one of Israel.

00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:31.460
I Jehovah am your God.

00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:34.460
The one teaching you to benefit yourself

00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:35.460
or as the footnote says,

00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:38.460
teaching you for your own good.

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:42.460
The one guiding you in the way you should walk.

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:46.460
If only you would pay attention to my commandments,

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:51.460
then your peace would become just like a river

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:56.460
and your righteousness like the waves of the sea.

00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:59.460
Paying attention to Jehovah's commandments

00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:01.460
results in two things.

00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:06.460
First, our peace will become just like a river,

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:10.460
serene, abundant, ongoing.

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:15.460
Second, our righteousness will be like the waves of the sea.

00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:18.460
Remember your last trip to the beach?

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:20.460
As you stood there on the shore,

00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:22.460
perhaps on a high hill overlooking the ocean,

00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:25.460
watching the waves roll in one after the other,

00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:28.460
just as they have for thousands of years,

00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:32.460
could you feel a sense of constancy?

00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:35.460
Jehovah says that our course of doing what is right

00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:37.460
can be just like that.

00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:40.460
He will guide us in the path of righteousness.

00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:43.460
He will bless us with unending peace.

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:48.460
In the process, we learn through experience.

00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:53.460
How Jehovah's wise and loving ways truly benefit us personally.

00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:55.460
But if we refuse to do that,

00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:58.460
we learn what agitation and discord truly mean.

00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:00.460
As verse 22 says,

00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:06.460
there is no peace, says Jehovah, for the wicked.

00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:09.460
It's not a heavy-handed threat to manipulate human behavior

00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:11.460
as if Jehovah needed to do that.

00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:15.460
It's a fact, a truth, a timeless principle.

00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:17.460
God is love.

00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:21.460
He teaches us for our own good and the result,

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:25.460
if we pay attention, is peace.

00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:29.460
Isaiah 48, 17, and 18.

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:38.460
And these verses assure us that imperfect humans truly can have a righteous standing with God.

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:40.460
Let's explore that further.

00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:47.460
Do you recall the very first time the word righteous is used in the Bible?

00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:50.460
Turn with me, please, to Genesis chapter 6.

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:53.460
Now you likely recognize this is the account about Noah.

00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:56.460
Noah lived in an extremely wicked world.

00:45:57.460 --> 00:46:00.460
During his lifetime, rebel angels left their assignments in heaven,

00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:03.460
materialized, married human women,

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:07.460
and fathered hybrid offspring who became violent giants.

00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:12.460
Now how did all of that wickedness and violence affect Jehovah?

00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:15.460
According to Genesis 6.6,

00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:18.460
his heart was saddened,

00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:21.460
which is a remarkable thing to contemplate, isn't it?

00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:24.460
Jehovah's feelings are affected by our decisions

00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:27.460
because he cares for us.

00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:34.460
That ancient world became so wicked that Jehovah decided it must be destroyed.

00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:37.460
And yet right in the midst of all this depravity,

00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:40.460
Noah showed a different spirit.

00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:46.460
Notice what it says at Genesis chapter 6 verses 8 and 9.

00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:51.460
But Noah found favor in the eyes of Jehovah.

00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:55.460
This is the history of Noah.

00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:59.460
Noah was a righteous man.

00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:00.460
There it is.

00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:04.460
And why was he described as righteous?

00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:10.460
He proved himself faultless among his contemporaries.

00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:14.460
Yes, Noah was not like the rebel angels or their offspring,

00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:16.460
or like degraded human society.

00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:20.460
Noah walked with the true God.

00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:25.460
And thus the second time we find the word righteous

00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:29.460
is at Genesis chapter 7 and verse 1.

00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:32.460
After that, Jehovah said to Noah,

00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:33.460
go into the art.

00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:39.460
You and all your household because you are the one I have found

00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:45.460
to be righteous before me among this generation.

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:47.460
Because of Noah's righteousness,

00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:50.460
he and his family survived the flood.

00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:54.460
To worship Jehovah on a cleansed earth.

00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:57.460
And after the waters subsided,

00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:00.460
and the family emerged from the ark,

00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:03.460
they witnessed a splendid sight.

00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:10.460
One never before observed a serene multi-colored arch in the sky,

00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:16.460
a rainbow, a reassuring indication of peace with God,

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:20.460
peace, resulting from righteousness.

00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:25.460
And where does the word righteous appear next in the Bible?

00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:27.460
In the account about Abraham,

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:30.460
notably in his famous conversation with Jehovah,

00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:33.460
found at Genesis chapter 18,

00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:35.460
where Jehovah promised Abraham that if he found as few

00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:38.460
as ten righteous people in the city of Sodom,

00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:41.460
he would not destroy that city.

00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:45.460
Now, what was it that distinguished Abraham as righteous

00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:48.460
in that moral climate?

00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:51.460
As you read Genesis chapters 12 through 22,

00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:55.460
you get the sense that Abraham was a man of great faith,

00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:56.460
unwavering faith.

00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:59.460
He was ready to do whatever Jehovah asked of him.

00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:04.460
Now, citing Genesis chapter 15 and verse 6 and other texts,

00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:11.460
James 223 says that Abraham put faith in Jehovah.

00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:16.460
And it was counted to him as righteousness.

00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:21.460
And he came to be called Jehovah's Friend.

00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:24.460
Jehovah's Friend.

00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:30.460
Peace with God, resulting from righteousness.

00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:33.460
Now, what about God's people today?

00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:37.460
Turn with me, please, to Isaiah chapter 60.

00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:41.460
Isaiah chapter 60.

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:47.460
Jehovah refers to Noah and Abraham as righteous.

00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:50.460
But what would he say about you and me?

00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:53.460
Well, notice what it says toward the end of this chapter.

00:49:53.460 --> 00:50:00.460
Isaiah 60 verses 21 and 22.

00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:08.059
And all your people will be righteous.

00:50:08.059 --> 00:50:12.059
They will possess the land forever.

00:50:12.059 --> 00:50:15.059
They are the sprout that I planted,

00:50:15.059 --> 00:50:18.059
the work of my hands for me to be beautified,

00:50:18.059 --> 00:50:20.059
the little one will become a thousand,

00:50:20.059 --> 00:50:22.059
and the small one a mighty nation,

00:50:22.059 --> 00:50:28.059
I myself, Jehovah, will speed it up in its own time.

00:50:28.059 --> 00:50:31.059
Yes, prospective members of the great crowd

00:50:31.059 --> 00:50:35.059
have been declared righteous as friends of God,

00:50:35.059 --> 00:50:37.059
as Abraham was.

00:50:37.059 --> 00:50:42.059
In Jehovah's eyes, they are, as it says in Revelation chapter 7 and verse 9,

00:50:42.059 --> 00:50:44.059
dressed in white robes.

00:50:44.059 --> 00:50:48.059
Today, they're serving alongside God's spirit- anointed ones

00:50:48.059 --> 00:50:51.059
who were declared righteous for life.

00:50:51.059 --> 00:50:54.059
Jehovah, our repurchaser,

00:50:54.059 --> 00:50:59.059
the holy one of Israel has bought us back from bondage to sin

00:50:59.059 --> 00:51:04.059
and death through the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ,

00:51:04.059 --> 00:51:09.059
and thus with faith in the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ,

00:51:09.059 --> 00:51:14.059
imperfect people are considered righteous in the sight of God.

00:51:14.059 --> 00:51:18.059
Now, in calling us righteous, Jehovah God by means of Jesus,

00:51:18.059 --> 00:51:21.059
has done something for us that we could not do for ourselves

00:51:21.059 --> 00:51:23.059
in our imperfect condition.

00:51:23.059 --> 00:51:27.059
But does that mean that we can do no wrong?

00:51:27.059 --> 00:51:31.059
No, it does not mean that.

00:51:31.059 --> 00:51:38.059
In order to maintain our peace, we must cooperate with Jehovah.

00:51:38.059 --> 00:51:42.059
Turn with me, please, to Romans chapter 1.

00:51:42.059 --> 00:51:46.059
Now, at light, Noah and Abraham,

00:51:46.059 --> 00:51:49.059
we live in a wicked and violent world where we are exposed

00:51:49.059 --> 00:51:54.059
to a spirit of disobedience, Satan wants us to become part of this world

00:51:54.059 --> 00:51:58.059
by adopting its unrighteous standards.

00:51:59.059 --> 00:52:02.059
In the world, sexual immorality is practiced without shame.

00:52:02.059 --> 00:52:05.059
Homosexuals flaunt their conduct,

00:52:05.059 --> 00:52:11.059
but Jehovah tells us that homosexual acts are unrighteous.

00:52:11.059 --> 00:52:16.059
God specifically warned the Israelites against this

00:52:16.059 --> 00:52:18.059
and other forms of immorality.

00:52:18.059 --> 00:52:27.059
Leviticus chapter 18 and verse 22 says that homosexual acts are detestable.

00:52:27.059 --> 00:52:30.059
Jehovah still find it so offensive?

00:52:30.059 --> 00:52:34.059
Well, notice what he inspired for both Jews and non-Jews

00:52:34.059 --> 00:52:41.059
in the Christian Greek scriptures here at Romans chapter 1 verses 26 and 27.

00:52:41.059 --> 00:52:48.059
That is why God gave them over to disgraceful sexual passion.

00:52:48.059 --> 00:52:52.059
For their females changed the natural use of themselves

00:52:52.059 --> 00:52:54.059
into one contrary to nature.

00:52:54.059 --> 00:52:58.059
Likewise, also the males left the natural use of the female

00:52:58.059 --> 00:53:02.059
and became violently inflamed in their lust toward one another.

00:53:02.059 --> 00:53:05.059
Males with males working with his obscene

00:53:05.059 --> 00:53:11.059
and receiving in themselves the full penalty which was due for their error.

00:53:11.059 --> 00:53:15.059
So, Jehovah has not changed.

00:53:15.059 --> 00:53:23.059
According to the creator, homosexual acts constitute disgraceful obscene error.

00:53:24.059 --> 00:53:26.059
Some would disagree.

00:53:26.059 --> 00:53:28.059
As verse 28 points out,

00:53:28.059 --> 00:53:33.059
such ones do not consider it worthwhile to acknowledge God,

00:53:33.059 --> 00:53:35.059
but with what result?

00:53:35.059 --> 00:53:37.059
As it says there,

00:53:37.059 --> 00:53:42.059
a disapproved mental state, just the opposite of peace.

00:53:42.059 --> 00:53:46.059
And merely approving of unrighteous conduct,

00:53:46.059 --> 00:53:47.059
displeases Jehovah.

00:53:47.059 --> 00:53:51.059
Notice how this is indicated in verse 32.

00:53:51.059 --> 00:53:55.059
Although these know full well the righteous decree of God

00:53:55.059 --> 00:53:59.059
that those practicing such things are deserving of death,

00:53:59.059 --> 00:54:01.059
they not only keep on doing them,

00:54:01.059 --> 00:54:06.059
but also approve of those practicing them.

00:54:06.059 --> 00:54:12.059
Still, we do not hate individuals who practice unrighteousness

00:54:12.059 --> 00:54:13.059
nor do we judge them.

00:54:13.059 --> 00:54:16.059
On the contrary, we share the good news with them.

00:54:16.059 --> 00:54:19.059
We remember that we were all born with the same infirmities

00:54:19.059 --> 00:54:21.059
and have the same sinful tendencies,

00:54:21.059 --> 00:54:26.059
but we also have the same inherent spiritual need.

00:54:26.059 --> 00:54:29.059
And thus, we recognize that others can have the same peace,

00:54:29.059 --> 00:54:37.059
the same privileges, and the same prospects we enjoy if they pay attention to Jehovah.

00:54:37.059 --> 00:54:43.059
1 Timothy 2, 3, and 4 says that God's will is that all sorts of people should be saved

00:54:43.059 --> 00:54:45.059
and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.

00:54:45.059 --> 00:54:49.059
People practicing all manner of unrighteousness have accepted the truth.

00:54:49.059 --> 00:54:53.059
That is what some of you were, 1 Corinthians 6-11 says.

00:54:53.059 --> 00:54:57.059
So we communicate impartially with all our neighbors,

00:54:57.059 --> 00:55:00.059
but we hate unrighteous conduct,

00:55:00.059 --> 00:55:04.059
and we refuse to compromise Bible principles.

00:55:04.059 --> 00:55:09.059
Now, sometimes moral issues become the center of heated political debates.

00:55:09.059 --> 00:55:12.059
We avoid getting drawn into such controversies.

00:55:13.059 --> 00:55:18.059
But now, in practical terms, what might that look like?

00:55:18.059 --> 00:55:22.059
In the following video, notice how adults can respond effectively

00:55:22.059 --> 00:55:26.059
when questioned on highly controversial issues.

00:55:26.059 --> 00:55:40.000
There you are.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:43.000
Did you both get the e-mail survey sent?

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:44.000
You're both coming, right?

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.000
I must have missed it. I was on calls all morning. What's this about?

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000
The whole office is leading early.

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:53.000
We're going downtown to support the march for gay rights.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.000
For gay rights?

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000
She won't go.

00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000
Why?

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.000
It's against our religion.

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.000
Some of her people came by my house, and when I asked,

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:08.000
they said, your church won't support gay marriage.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:13.300
I read.

00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:15.300
It's true. As Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:18.300
we hold to the Bible standard on marriage,

00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:21.300
which is only between a man and a woman.

00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:24.300
And we remain politically neutral.

00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:29.179
That's such ignorant thinking.

00:56:29.179 --> 00:56:32.179
I understand it's a sensitive subject.

00:56:32.179 --> 00:56:36.179
I have a daughter who deserves her rights.

00:56:36.179 --> 00:56:38.179
Trust me, Amber.

00:56:38.179 --> 00:56:40.179
As one of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:56:40.179 --> 00:56:43.179
we believe everyone has a right to choose how they live.

00:56:43.179 --> 00:56:46.179
And I would never force my beliefs on anyone.

00:56:46.179 --> 00:56:48.179
But you won't go.

00:56:48.179 --> 00:56:51.179
Just as I would never force my beliefs on you,

00:56:51.179 --> 00:56:54.179
all I ask is the same respect.

00:56:54.179 --> 00:56:56.179
And no, I won't be going.

00:56:56.179 --> 00:56:58.179
I have to go back to work.

00:56:58.179 --> 00:57:05.889
Look, obviously I read.

00:57:05.889 --> 00:57:08.889
I don't agree with your perspective.

00:57:08.889 --> 00:57:11.889
But I do appreciate that you're not pushing on anyone else.

00:57:11.889 --> 00:57:25.920
Thank you.

00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:28.920
In contrast with the majority of mankind who are divided,

00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:31.920
true Christians are united.

00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:34.920
We loyally support Jehovah's right to rule.

00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:36.920
We don't set the standards,

00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:39.920
and we're not trying to solve the world's problems on our own.

00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:42.920
We fully support God's kingdom.

00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:45.920
As we observed in the video, moral and political issues

00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:47.920
might be brought up in the workplace.

00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:49.920
But more often, our young ones,

00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:51.920
even very young ones,

00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:54.920
are confronted with these same topics.

00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:56.920
How will they respond?

00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:58.920
Are your young ones ready?

00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:00.920
As you watch the next video,

00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:07.389
notice how Olivia defends Jehovah's Righteous Standards.

00:58:07.389 --> 00:58:09.389
Great discussion today, everyone.

00:58:09.389 --> 00:58:13.389
Remember, midterms of this Friday, no excuses.

00:58:13.389 --> 00:58:15.389
That includes you, Jordan.

00:58:15.389 --> 00:58:20.389
You were noticeably silent during our discussion today, Olivia.

00:58:20.389 --> 00:58:24.389
I was. I guess I just didn't have much to say.

00:58:24.389 --> 00:58:28.389
Aren't you concerned about gay rights?

00:58:28.389 --> 00:58:32.389
Well, it seems like a political issue,

00:58:32.389 --> 00:58:36.389
and I say neutral when it comes to political stuff.

00:58:36.389 --> 00:58:38.389
But it's not a political issue.

00:58:38.389 --> 00:58:40.389
This is a human rights issue.

00:58:40.389 --> 00:58:43.389
Mr. Dallas, she's like crazy religious.

00:58:43.389 --> 00:58:45.389
Hey, there's nothing wrong with it.

00:58:45.389 --> 00:58:46.389
No, you don't understand.

00:58:46.389 --> 00:58:49.389
Jehovah's Witnesses hate everybody that isn't straight.

00:58:49.389 --> 00:58:51.389
That's not true. We don't hate anyone.

00:58:51.389 --> 00:58:54.389
I've spoken with your people before.

00:58:54.389 --> 00:58:56.389
They seem big on equality.

00:58:56.389 --> 00:58:59.389
We are. The Bible says God isn't partial,

00:58:59.389 --> 00:59:03.389
so we believe that everyone should be treated fairly.

00:59:03.389 --> 00:59:05.389
Good.

00:59:05.389 --> 00:59:10.389
So, I assume you have gay members in your church?

00:59:10.389 --> 00:59:12.389
No, we don't.

00:59:12.389 --> 00:59:18.889
But I thought you just said everyone should be treated equal.

00:59:18.889 --> 00:59:20.889
I'm confused.

00:59:20.889 --> 00:59:22.889
I called it.

00:59:22.889 --> 00:59:25.889
Jordan, don't you have a class to get to?

00:59:25.889 --> 00:59:31.889
As I was saying, how is that not a little hypocritical?

00:59:31.889 --> 00:59:33.889
Saying that you love everyone,

00:59:33.889 --> 00:59:35.889
and then excluding certain people?

00:59:35.889 --> 00:59:50.940
Honestly, Mr. Dallas, I've wondered the same thing.

00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:52.940
Okay.

00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:54.940
And?

00:59:54.940 --> 00:59:57.940
Well, I researched it in the Bible,

00:59:57.940 --> 01:00:00.940
and I realized that God accepts all people,

01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:02.940
but He doesn't accept all conduct.

01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:06.789
What does that mean?

01:00:06.789 --> 01:00:11.679
It means that you can't be abusing drugs,

01:00:11.679 --> 01:00:14.679
you can't be stealing,

01:00:14.679 --> 01:00:18.679
or being violent, and still be a witness.

01:00:19.679 --> 01:00:26.690
There's just certain actions that God just doesn't accept.

01:00:26.690 --> 01:00:30.690
Including how someone expresses their sexuality?

01:00:30.690 --> 01:00:33.690
In some cases, yes.

01:00:33.690 --> 01:00:35.690
We follow God's standards,

01:00:35.690 --> 01:00:38.690
not having sex without being married.

01:00:38.690 --> 01:00:43.000
Well, if that's how you feel,

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
that's your right.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Personally, it seems a tad archaic to me,

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
but to each their own.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:01:02.489
Hey, hey, does the Bible really say all that?

01:01:02.489 --> 01:01:04.489
Yeah, it does.

01:01:04.489 --> 01:01:07.489
Okay, maybe you could show me some time.

01:01:07.489 --> 01:01:09.489
Yeah, for sure.

01:01:09.489 --> 01:01:10.489
Awesome.

01:01:10.489 --> 01:01:38.900
So we can expect future installments in this saga.

01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:44.900
But did you notice how Olivia was able to defend Jehovah's Righteous Standards?

01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:47.900
She kept her peaceful spirit, didn't she?

01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:50.900
She acknowledged that she had the same question as the teacher,

01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:53.900
and she had done further research on the subject.

01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:55.900
And did you appreciate how she subtly showed

01:01:55.900 --> 01:02:00.900
that Jehovah's Standards benefit both the individual and the community?

01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:04.900
As examples, she highlighted the avoidance of drug abuse and theft.

01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:08.900
Values she knew her teacher would appreciate.

01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:16.900
Parents are your young ones able to explain why we do or don't do certain things.

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:21.900
Do you know how your children really feel about Jehovah's Standards?

01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:25.900
Are they obedient simply to avoid making you mad?

01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:30.900
If so, will that truly be enough?

01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:36.900
Encourage your young ones to prove to themselves why Jehovah's Standards are wise.

01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:41.900
Help them to see how they can explain their choice to live by Jehovah's Standards.

01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:46.900
Teach them how to resist pressure to follow the world.

01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:54.570
We are so thankful that even during these critical times,

01:02:54.570 --> 01:03:00.570
hard to deal with, we can enjoy the inner peace that Jehovah gives to the righteous.

01:03:00.570 --> 01:03:04.570
But let's remind ourselves of what Jehovah promises to bring about

01:03:04.570 --> 01:03:08.570
once Satan's unrighteous system is removed.

01:03:08.570 --> 01:03:13.570
Turn with me, please, to Psalm 37.

01:03:13.570 --> 01:03:19.570
Here in these familiar verses, we find a beautiful description of what is to come.

01:03:19.570 --> 01:03:27.570
And notice once again, how the Bible makes the correlation between peace and righteousness.

01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:30.570
Psalm 37.29.

01:03:30.570 --> 01:03:32.570
Do you have it?

01:03:32.570 --> 01:03:34.570
What does it say?

01:03:34.570 --> 01:03:38.570
Who will possess the earth?

01:03:38.570 --> 01:03:39.570
The righteous.

01:03:39.570 --> 01:03:43.570
And for how long will they live on it?

01:03:43.570 --> 01:03:45.570
Forever.

01:03:45.570 --> 01:03:51.940
And then according to verse 11, what will they find there?

01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:52.940
Peace.

01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:56.940
The result of true righteousness will be peace.

01:03:56.940 --> 01:03:58.940
And how much peace will they find?

01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:01.940
A little peace, just personal or family peace?

01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:05.940
Remember, the righteous already had peace with God even when wicked people still existed.

01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:10.940
But what will Jehovah provide to all those who continue loving him?

01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:14.940
The abundance of peace.

01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:17.940
And how will you feel about that?

01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:21.940
Delighted or exquisitely delighted?

01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:23.940
So stick with it, dear friends.

01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:29.940
During this convention, be on the lookout for the connection between peace and righteousness.

01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:31.940
Continue on the course of righteousness.

01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:34.940
Help others to find the way of peace.

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:37.940
In that way, we can enjoy peace with Jehovah now,

01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:41.940
throughout the remainder of these last days, and on into the future,

01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:44.940
when Jesus rules as King over a cleanser,

01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:51.670
in which the righteous will flourish, and peace will abound.

01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:54.670
Thank you, brother Schaefer, for helping us to understand

01:04:54.670 --> 01:05:00.670
why upholding Jehovah's righteousness is essential for enjoying true peace.

01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:07.670
We have been well instructed during this first session of our convention, haven't we?

01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:09.670
We look forward to our next session,

01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:16.670
in which we will consider in greater detail, promises of peace, founding God's Word.

01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:22.670
We will also see how Bible principles can help families to enjoy greater peace now,

01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:29.780
and how we can avoid pursuing imitation peace.

01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:35.780
Now, let's conclude this session by singing song number 97 entitled,

01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:39.780
Life Depends on God's Word.

01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:44.780
After singing the song, you may have your local concluding prayer.

01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:47.780
Again, that song number 97.
