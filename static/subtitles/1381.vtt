00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:05.599
It's vital that each of us know how to find spiritual food,

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:08.500
whether it's through a library of books, a computer,

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.859
or a handheld device.

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:14.339
But the availability of spiritual food is not enough.

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.140
We must also learn how to make effective use

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.500
of the tools we have.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.219
Pay close attention and be reminded of how

00:00:22.219 --> 00:00:25.019
three of our research tools can be used

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.140
when we need to find spiritual treasures.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:45.859
As Jehovah's people, we often find ourselves

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:52.170
in situations that may require us to do research.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.570
For example, isn't that a lovely thought?

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.170
But personally, I pray to the saints.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.969
They really do help me.

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.969
What do you think about praying to the saints?

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:06.370
That's a really interesting question.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.769
I know we have some information on that.

00:01:08.769 --> 00:01:10.769
Perhaps I could come back in a couple of days

00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:15.969
and we could discuss that together.

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:20.370
Open up your textbooks, turn to page 26.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:27.370
And we all know that evolution is a trusted scientific theory.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:43.150
And it is well supported by the fossil records.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.549
How to identify the true religion?

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.150
Where do I start?

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.349
At times like these, what are some basic research techniques

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:55.150
that can help us?

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.750
Let's take a look at our available research tools.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.549
Watch Tower Library.

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.150
Research Guide and Watch Tower Online Library.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.750
And the JW Library app.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.949
Each of these has unique features that can help us

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:16.330
in a variety of ways.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.930
The Watch Tower Library program is very easy to use.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.729
Simply type in a word in the search field.

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:27.330
And you will see a vast amount of references

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.129
listed for that subject.

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.129
If you wish to see the very latest information,

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.129
simply click on the Year tab.

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.930
Or for easy viewing, you can categorize all the references

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.729
by clicking on the category tab at the bottom.

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:47.330
A nice feature of this tool is that you don't need

00:02:47.330 --> 00:03:09.960
an internet connection to access it.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.919
Have you had a chance to use our Research Guide?

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:17.719
While this tool doesn't list every subject

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:20.520
that has been discussed in our publications,

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.319
the topics that are listed contain the most current references.

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.719
Each topic links you directly to the appropriate article

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:33.120
on the Watch Tower Online Library.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.120
If you wanted to do an additional search

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.120
using Watch Tower Online Library,

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.319
simply click on the Watch Tower symbol

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.319
in the upper left-hand corner

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:57.900
and enter your desired topic.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.500
A great mobile research tool is our JW Library app.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.500
Under the Publications tab,

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.699
it has a growing number of publications and videos to choose from.

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:13.900
Each of these can be downloaded to your mobile device

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.899
for quick offline access.

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:19.899
But suppose you're thinking of a specific scripture

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:22.500
and can't remember the exact verse.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.699
No problem.

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:27.199
The JW Library app can help again.

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.600
Navigate to the search icon shown on the homepage

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.800
and type in a keyword.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.800
To refine the search,

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.110
multiple keywords can be entered.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.110
Yes, young and old can take advantage

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.910
of these excellent research tools

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.110
to help find satisfying answers.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.910
Improving our ability to do research

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.110
strengthens our relationship with Jehovah

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.709
so that we may be fully competent,

00:04:57.709 --> 00:05:01.910
completely equipped for every good work.

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:08.370
So let's make good use of our research tools.

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.569
Did you see something that could help you

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:12.970
in your spiritual studies?

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.370
As an example,

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.170
why not use the Research Guide

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.370
in the Watch Tower Online Library

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.370
for an answer to your question?
