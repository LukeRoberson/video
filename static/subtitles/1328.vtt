00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:25.129
For me, this is a historical moment. I was very worried about how we will succeed.

00:00:25.129 --> 00:00:30.129
But you can see that this is not possible just by people's efforts.

00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:33.130
The angels are helping and Jehovah gives his spirit.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:38.130
Actually, this went beyond our dreams, what we get.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:45.130
Of course, they have in many efforts put into it, but it was worth it.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:52.130
And we are very thankful to the governing body that they made it this possible for us.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:01:02.460
We welcome the 60 brothers and sisters who symbolize their dedication to Jehovah,

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:10.939
who have now joined us as footstep followers of Jesus.

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.939
Thank you, friends, for all the love and the kindness you've shown us here in Sofia.

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:22.939
It's a great privilege to be here with all of you and feeling the love that Jehovah has for us

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.939
and for everyone of you as well.

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:37.620
I think that the best gift that we received from our brothers was their smiles of happiness.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.620
We saw how the brothers and sisters with all their hearts gave their time

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.620
and were thinking about how to make the delegates feel welcome.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:52.620
To hold this special event is really a huge privilege for us.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.620
Thank you all for coming.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:04.909
We are happy and we look forward to seeing each other again.

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:06.909
Thank you for your gift.

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:21.680
I think the question we all had in the beginning was, will we make it?

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.680
Still today, I don't really understand how it worked out, but we used everyone everywhere.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:38.020
We knew that the brothers' young Bulgaria had less materially, but we also saw that they had a big heart.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.020
Many different languages are spoken yet, but the spirit is the same.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:52.909
We experienced what an international brotherhood really is.

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:56.909
The local congregations helped a lot.

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:59.909
They prepared a pleasant surprise for every tour.

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:06.479
At the end, we saw joy and happiness on the brother's faces.

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:12.340
For being here for the week, it really had such an impact on us.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.340
It's been wonderful.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.340
It's been a faith-building experience, and it really brings us together as a worldwide organization.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.340
We're privileged to be a part of it.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.030
So when we follow the instructions from the organization,

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:34.030
regarding the ministry, and we think about the brothers' happiness and joy in the ministry,

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.659
we can see the result.

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.659
We saw that in the end, Jehovah opened large doors.

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:47.659
We managed to accommodate our precious delegates in the best hotels,

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:54.669
and we saw how Jehovah can make the impossible possible.

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:59.669
These three days, we met our relatives from Bulgaria,

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:05.669
from the United States, from Macedonia, from Serbia, Ukraine, Moldova.

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:14.979
And we wouldn't change this for anything else.

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:17.980
Some of the joyful tears we were shed in the new world,

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.980
we have experienced here.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.980
The memory of this is beautiful.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:22.980
Thank you.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.980
We are truly a family.

00:04:47.149 --> 00:04:52.149
The feeling I had with this event is just like we had the impression to walk

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:57.149
for a few moments in the new world, is the way I felt.

00:04:57.149 --> 00:05:01.149
We would like to help you learn how you can be on Jesus' side,

00:05:01.149 --> 00:05:05.149
on his side when he completely conquers the world.

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:45.149
We look forward to being with you at a convention in the new world.
