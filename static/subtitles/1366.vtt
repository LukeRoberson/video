00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:07.049
We wanted to share a portrayal of life as a witness back in the early 1900s.

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.970
This unique dramatization about the endurance needed as a kingdom proclaimer was previously

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:19.809
shown to delegates at some international conventions held in one city in 2014.

00:00:19.809 --> 00:00:22.170
This is a gift video that we received.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.449
The title is Knock Knock.

00:00:24.449 --> 00:06:37.930
Where are the dead?

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.810
Did you wish that question answered according to Man's theory or to have the answers pointed

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:44.730
out in the Bible?

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:50.569
You will say Man's answer would be only a guest, and yet there is no truth more clearly

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:55.529
taught in the Bible than that of the resurrection of the dead.

00:06:55.529 --> 00:07:00.889
If the dead are to live again, then they must be resurrected and God has provided that

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:03.610
our shall be a resurrection.

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:09.290
The resurrection of Jesus Christ is a guarantee that all who have died must be awakened out

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:13.509
of death and give it a knowledge of the truth.

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:18.750
All mankind were born in sin, and the death of the perfect man Jesus provided the purchased

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:23.829
price for the right of man to live again, and in due time Jesus will awaken them out

00:07:23.829 --> 00:07:26.430
of death.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:31.829
All of the dead in God's due time should be awakened out of death.

00:07:31.829 --> 00:07:35.949
That shall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there shall be no more death, either

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:43.110
sire or cry, neither shall there be any more pain, for the form of things are passed away.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:49.069
The resurrection will bring boundless joy to those who obey God under Christ's kingdom.

00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:53.709
The obedient ones on earth, during the reign of Christ, will be given everlasting life

00:07:53.709 --> 00:07:58.980
on their incomplete happiness and joy.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:09.389
The hobos way is always right and true, learn that way and live.

00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:13.990
The word resurrection means his standing up again to life.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:19.389
If his claim with the clergy, the dead are alive in purgatory or some other place, then

00:08:19.389 --> 00:08:23.829
it follows that there could be no resurrection, and yet there is no truth or hurt at all.
