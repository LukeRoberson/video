00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:16.890
Arctite ground squirrels hibernate up to seven months every year.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.300
Though sometimes compared to sleep, hibernation is very different.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.300
Sleep refreshes the brain.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.929
In contrast, hibernation seems to devastate it.

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:37.929
As the squirrel enters hibernation, his breathing and heartbeat slow dramatically

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:42.929
and his tiny body chills to just below freezing.

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:49.929
Blood flow slows to a trickle and deprives his brain of oxygen and nutrition.

00:00:49.929 --> 00:01:02.240
As the days pass, brain cells call neurons shrink and thousands or even millions of connections that make up his memories appear to dissolve.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:08.239
Proteins clump and cling to the neurons, advancing memory loss.

00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:14.239
In some ways, his brain starts to resemble a brain affected by Alzheimer's disease.

00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:18.239
Then something amazing happens.

00:01:18.239 --> 00:01:26.239
About every two weeks, he shivers vigorously until his body warms to its normal temperature,

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:30.239
which it remains at for up to 15 hours.

00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:37.239
During this time, his brain cleans away the clumped proteins and re-grows the shrunken neurons.

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:42.239
Restoring full brain capacity in about two hours.

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:47.239
The process is repeated during his entire seven-month hibernation,

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:56.709
depriving his brain of food and oxygen, then rebuilding it about every two weeks,

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:04.359
until he merges in the spring, unscathed.

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:06.359
And that's not all.

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:13.360
Scientists think that old connections between neurons are somehow marked for quick reconnection,

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:22.360
so the squirrel gets back not just a working brain, but also something inconceivable, his memories.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:31.360
Researchers hope a better understanding of this process will pave the way for therapies to treat disease in the human brain.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.360
What do you think?

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.360
Did the regenerative ability of the arctic ground squirrel's brain simply evolve?

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.360
Or was it designed?
