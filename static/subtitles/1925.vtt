00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:07.980
Welcome. In this update, we will talk about planning now for spiritual activities over

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.900
the next few months. But first, here are a few updates.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:22.660
On March 28, 2025, a 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar and Thailand. The epicenter

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:29.859
was in Myanmar in the city of Mandalay. Many brothers and sisters had fled to Mandalay because

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:36.700
of war in various parts of the country. Sadly, a married couple serving as missionaries

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:43.020
in Mandalay died when the apartment building they were living in collapsed. We can only

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.740
imagine the pain and grief felt by their family members and the many brothers and sisters

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:55.219
who loved them dearly. We continue to pray that Jehovah gives these ones the strength

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:01.219
and comfort they need at this time. Another missionary couple living in that same building

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:08.180
survived, but sustained serious injuries. They have received emergency medical care and

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.900
thankfully, they are expected to make a full recovery. Seven other witnesses sustained

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:22.219
mostly minor injuries. Six homes owned by our brothers were destroyed and 77 more were

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:29.180
damaged. Six kingdom halls were also damaged. The branch committee is coordinating relief

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:37.780
efforts, including repairs and reconstruction. In South America and in southern and eastern

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.260
Africa, some of our brothers and sisters are suffering from famine. To address these

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:52.620
needs, we are providing food relief to over 8,000 brothers and sisters in six countries.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:02:01.420
We sincerely thank you for your generous contributions that make this relief work possible.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.739
While we continue to support our brothers and sisters in their challenges, we also have

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:12.699
some positive news to share from around the world. We're pleased to inform you that on

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:24.379
February 12, 2025, 72-year-old sister Alganesh Tecde was released from prison in Eritrea.

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:33.979
And on March 12, 2025, 80-year-old sister Beracti Gibratatios was also released. They have

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:39.979
been reunited with their families and are receiving the care they need. Both sisters

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:47.259
were among the 23 brothers and sisters previously reported on who were arrested in September

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:55.659
2024. We're also happy to report that six brothers were recently released from prison

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:02.620
in Russia after serving their sentences. This includes brother Demetri Golik, who served

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.939
about four years in prison. Upon release, Demetri was met by his wife and a group of family

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:18.340
members and friends. Also recently released was brother Inverse Yukov. His sister and her husband

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:26.819
were there to share his joy. Inver spent four years in a pre-trial detention center. That is

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:32.979
a record for the amount of time that one of our brothers has spent in pre-trial detention,

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:41.699
where conditions are often harsher than a penal colony. Despite such conditions, Inver gave a

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:49.139
good witness by his conduct. For example, a fellow prisoner sent him a letter of gratitude

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:58.020
that says, in part, thank you for being you. You are making this world a better place, showing by

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:06.580
example what we should be and what we can become. Your eyes always shine with warmth. Even here,

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:14.819
you help people feel happy at least for a moment. You manage to restore my faith in people.

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:25.540
This world needs you. We all need you. We are so proud of our imprisoned brothers and sisters.

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:33.300
Although many are enduring harsh conditions, they continue to glorify Jehovah by their fine

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:42.420
conduct. As Matthew chapter 5 and verse 16 says, Let your light shine before men so that they may

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.620
see your fine works and give glory to your father who is in the heavens.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:55.699
May Jehovah continue to strengthen and support all of our brothers and sisters who are in prison

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:04.899
for their faith. Here's another recent development. In March 2025, the governing body invited

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:12.660
branch committee members 80 years of age or older to consider their circumstances. As a result,

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:18.259
some of these dear brothers have made a personal decision that they will no longer serve as

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:27.540
branch committee members. Let's hear from a few. Old age sneaks up on you and you don't realize

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:33.939
at times the limitations that you have. So this was a way for the governing body to help us

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:44.740
to just accept the reality of old age in the consequences. During my almost 77 years of full-time

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:52.339
service, I have always experienced that Jehovah's guidance through the faithful slave brings joy and

00:05:52.339 --> 00:06:00.899
contentment. I truly believe that this arrangement is an expression of Jehovah's deep love.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:08.500
Even if our assignments change in the future, regardless of what assignment it may be,

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:17.300
will be an opportunity to enjoy our service or constantly thinking about pleasing Jehovah.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:26.420
This is the answer to a prayer. We cannot keep up. Let somebody else younger, stronger,

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:33.220
do the job and they're doing it. It makes me very happy to see younger brothers now on our

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:39.779
branch committee and they're doing a great job and I know allowing for other younger brothers to come

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:48.660
in. It's going to help the organization. It does help me to appreciate do what you can, not what you

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:55.060
can't do and love it. Follow Jehovah's direction. You'll always be happy.

00:06:58.579 --> 00:07:03.540
The governing body deeply loves and respects these dear brothers.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:10.259
If their circumstances permit, they will continue to share in teaching assignments,

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:16.339
such as conducting morning worship, serving as branch representatives at circuit assemblies,

00:07:16.899 --> 00:07:24.019
and in giving talks at regional conventions. In that way, our brothers and sisters will continue

00:07:24.019 --> 00:07:31.939
to benefit from their many years of faithful service. We're all looking forward to the

00:07:31.939 --> 00:07:40.259
2025 Pure Worship Conventions. This convention series began the weekend of May 9-11,

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:51.620
2025 and will continue into early 2026. It will include 19 special conventions to be held in

00:07:51.620 --> 00:08:00.180
13 countries. The first special convention was held the weekend of May 9-11 in Santa Cruz,

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:12.259
Bolivia. The peak attendance was 12,380 and 177 were baptized. I am sure we are all looking forward

00:08:12.259 --> 00:08:19.139
to attending a convention. As a reminder, so that everyone can get the most out of the convention

00:08:19.139 --> 00:08:26.259
program, the governing body requests that we all please be seated so that we can listen to the

00:08:26.259 --> 00:08:34.580
convention's musical preludes. This will allow us to prepare our minds and hearts for the convention

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:42.980
program. Speaking of conventions, here's another update. Recently, the brothers at World Headquarters

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:50.820
reviewed the audio and video equipment needs for regional conventions in 20 African branches.

00:08:51.779 --> 00:08:59.059
Outstandingly, the attendance in these 20 branch territories was nearly two and a half times

00:08:59.059 --> 00:09:07.620
the number of publishers. This represents close to five million attendees. But not all of the

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:14.259
convention locations have sufficient audio and video equipment to enjoy the convention program

00:09:14.259 --> 00:09:20.899
like our brothers in other lands. We're pleased to inform you that the governing body has approved

00:09:20.899 --> 00:09:30.500
to spend $21.1 million over a three-year period to purchase additional audio and video equipment

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:38.019
for conventions in Africa. A phased approach will be used to purchase and deploy the equipment

00:09:38.019 --> 00:09:45.059
for assembly halls, rented facilities, expandable kingdom halls, and even open fields.

00:09:46.019 --> 00:09:53.779
For 2026, the focus will be primarily on equipping conventions with sufficient audio equipment

00:09:53.779 --> 00:09:59.779
and generators. Some convention sites will be prepared to install new video setups

00:09:59.779 --> 00:10:07.460
to enhance existing setups. We thank you for your generosity and making it possible

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:14.100
for us to provide this equipment that will greatly benefit our brothers and sisters as well

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:22.419
as many interested ones. Now, let's talk about planning spiritual activities.

00:10:23.299 --> 00:10:29.139
In the Northern Hemisphere, as we move into summer, many of us will have our conventions in

00:10:29.139 --> 00:10:35.059
the weeks ahead. Even in the Southern Hemisphere, many conventions will be held in the next few

00:10:35.059 --> 00:10:42.259
months, and you may be planning other activities or possibly vacations, too. As you look ahead,

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:51.460
what is a good principle to remember? The greatest joy and satisfaction will come from giving to

00:10:51.460 --> 00:11:01.620
our wonderful God, Jehovah. As Proverbs 3, 9 in 10 says, honor Jehovah with your valuable things,

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:08.500
with the first fruits of all your produce, then your storehouses will be completely filled,

00:11:09.059 --> 00:11:17.139
and your vats will overflow with new wine. So, as we plan our activities for the next few months,

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:23.539
let's consider what opportunities we might have to expand our service to Jehovah.

00:11:24.659 --> 00:11:28.899
Young ones, if you have time off school during the next few months,

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:35.059
could you spend more time in the ministry? In the weeks leading up to each convention,

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:42.419
we'll invite our neighbors to attend the convention with us. That's an excellent time to expand

00:11:42.419 --> 00:11:50.340
our ministry. Could you auxiliary pioneer? Many of us have fond memories of auxiliary pioneering

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:57.460
during school breaks. Of course, this applies not only to our younger ones. All of us want to

00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:03.860
consider if we could auxiliary pioneer. Perhaps we might even be able to do so as a family.

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:11.779
Could we reach out to work some unassigned or seldom worked territory? No doubt such activities

00:12:11.779 --> 00:12:19.460
would bring us deep joy and satisfaction. Some of you young ones are finishing school in the coming

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:26.019
months. If so, have you prayerfully considered the goal of regular pioneering?

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:33.860
The new service year is just a few months away. Why not consider putting in your application?

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:39.940
There are also opportunities to volunteer for Kingdom Hall maintenance and construction.

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:48.419
Could you apply to share in this work? And remember that baptized brothers and sisters 18 years of

00:12:48.419 --> 00:12:56.980
age and older may now apply for Bethel. That's another wonderful way to serve Jehovah.

00:12:58.259 --> 00:13:03.620
This is also an excellent time to think about attending the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:10.899
Recently, the governing body encouraged young ones to consider the goal of missionary service.

00:13:11.779 --> 00:13:19.539
SKE is the door to missionary service. Have you put in your application for SKE?

00:13:20.419 --> 00:13:27.220
Remember that baptized brothers and sisters who are at least 21 years of age and who have been

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:32.820
serving as regular pioneers for at least two years may apply to attend.

00:13:33.779 --> 00:13:43.139
There are so many exciting opportunities. Please, carefully consider which ones may be open to you.

00:13:44.419 --> 00:13:50.659
Of course, we are also making plans to attend the convention in person if at all possible.

00:13:51.860 --> 00:14:00.259
Even if we have limited health or strength, could we attend in person one day or even a half day of

00:14:00.419 --> 00:14:09.139
the convention? Doing so would allow us the joy of praying together, singing together and being

00:14:09.139 --> 00:14:18.179
with our dear brothers and sisters in person. In this update, we have considered a variety of ways

00:14:18.179 --> 00:14:25.779
that we can be busy in spiritual activities. With good planning, we can accomplish much.

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:33.299
Our prayer for all of you is contained in the words of Psalm 20, verse 4, which says,

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:43.940
may he grant you the desires of your heart and give success to all your plans. Brothers and sisters,

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:53.779
we love you all very much. From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.
