00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:06.650
Brothers and sisters, your generous contributions

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:11.650
are what make theocratic events like this one possible,

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:18.649
including the obtaining of the audio video equipment required.

00:00:18.649 --> 00:00:23.649
However, the same technology is not readily available

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:25.649
for conventions everywhere.

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:29.649
In some countries, large video screens

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:34.649
or high-quality speakers are simply not obtainable

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.649
due to logistical reasons or perhaps political unrest

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:41.649
in the country.

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:43.649
But whatever the circumstances,

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.649
what's important for Jehovah's Organization

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.649
is that everyone is spiritually fed.

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.649
Take this convention in a refugee settlement

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.649
in Western Uganda as an example.

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.650
Television screens were transported on unpaved roads

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.650
through forest, tea plantations, and small villages.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.650
Similar setups with television screens were used

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.650
in other countries as well.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.650
At times, large video walls are used,

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.650
making it easier for a larger audience

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.650
to see all the beautiful videos that were produced

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.650
for the convention.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.650
For example, in Brazil,

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.650
video screens were used at 167 regional conventions.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.650
These screens are owned by the organization

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.650
and were sent to one convention after another.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:56.650
Traveling a distance equal to more than twice around the earth.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.650
And in Sweden, a mobile control room was used

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.650
to coordinate and synchronize the video

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.650
and audio production of the convention

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.650
in four spoken languages and three sign languages.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.650
These are only a few examples of what Jehovah's Organization does

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.650
in order to arrange conventions around the world

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.650
to spiritually build up Jehovah's people.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.650
But this would not be possible without your contributions.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.650
Also, as was the case here in the United States,

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.650
oftentimes a decision is made to purchase equipment

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.650
that is used frequently instead of paying for a rental each time,

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.650
which can be very expensive.
