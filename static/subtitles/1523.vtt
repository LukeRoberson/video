00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:24.640
The arrangement for worship at the tent or tabernacle is an illustration.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:33.479
Through it, Jehovah revealed how he would forgive the sins of mankind on the basis of Jesus' ransom sacrifice.

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:42.520
For example, on the day of atonement, the high priest performed a ceremony that had great symbolic meaning.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:49.109
Three times on that day, he entered the holy compartment,

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:56.640
and then passed through the curtain that separated it from the most holy.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:04.099
On his first entry, he burned perfumed incense before the ark of the covenant.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:10.900
When he entered the second time, he spattered the blood of a slaughtered bull.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:22.129
On his third and final entry, he spattered the blood of a slaughtered goat.

00:01:22.129 --> 00:01:26.849
Afterward, the high priest, now in his official garments,

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:30.689
presented sacrifices on the altar of burnt offering.

00:01:30.769 --> 00:01:35.730
Together, these sacrifices were a symbol of atonement for the sins of Israel.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.959
Many of these steps foreshadowed actions that Jesus, as the great high priest, would take

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:48.519
to atone for the sins of all mankind.

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:57.250
Before the high priest offered up sacrifices, he prepared the way for Jehovah to accept them

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.209
by burning incense. Before Jesus sacrificed his life,

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:05.650
he prepared the way by living a life of integrity,

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.689
and offering up fervent prayers that were like a sweet smelling aroma to Jehovah.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.650
Like the curtain that blocked entry into the most holy,

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.289
Jesus' human body prevented him from entering the heavens.

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:25.889
But after Jesus died, he was resurrected and could enter heaven,

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:28.689
which was represented by the most holy.

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.810
The high priest spattered the sacrificial blood before the arc of the covenant,

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.810
which represented Jehovah's presence.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.289
Jesus presented the value of his sacrifice before Jehovah himself.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.080
The high priest presented whole burnt offerings on the altar.

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:56.879
Jesus offered himself up as a complete sacrifice,

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:02.000
and Jehovah was willing to accept it as atoning for mankind's sins.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.960
Jesus is a vastly superior high priest compared with the human high priests

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.560
who served at the Tabernacle.

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:17.439
And Jesus' sacrifice was far more valuable than any animal sacrifice is offered there.

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:25.840
It laid the basis for Jehovah to forgive the sins, not of one nation, but of all mankind.
