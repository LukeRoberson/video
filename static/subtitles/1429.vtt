00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:09.720
I've been involved in the international construction service for eight years in Congo, in Senegal, and now we're here in the Philippines.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:18.719
It's such a wonderful, wonderful privilege that Jehovah has given me through the years to learn different skills that I never ever imagined I was able to do.

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:21.719
A construction site is a very happy site.

00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:27.719
Once you get there and you're working with your brothers and sisters, it's just happiness and joy.

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:36.719
To be able to see the love they have for Jehovah and the love they have for their assignment, that has been a wonderful thing.

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.719
Everywhere you go, you can learn from a culture.

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.719
There's like strong points in each culture that you can learn and apply in your own life.

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:53.719
There's been challenges and sacrifices we've made, for example, living behind friends who have become very close.

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.719
The congregation is a stronghold. It stabilizes us.

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:03.719
Actually, without the congregation, we couldn't be able to do our assignment.

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.719
When we first came to the Philippines, we were feeling kind of low and out of place.

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:13.719
But then the family from our new hall invited us over for a meal after service.

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:17.719
There would be some really good tasty local dishes,

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:24.719
they played music, we sang, that just canceled the homesickness that we were feeling.

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:29.719
We support the local congregation by having a good service routine.

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:32.719
The construction work that we do is the physical work.

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:35.719
So sometimes we can lose the focus.

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:41.719
We're being out in service, being with the Virgin Sisters. It puts you back in focus.

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:46.719
I really love being an international service because I love people.

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:52.719
Working for hours with my Virgin Sisters just makes me very happy.

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:57.719
And at the end of the day, always, always a very good day.
