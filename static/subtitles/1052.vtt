WEBVTT

00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:06.459
All of us around the world rejoice with you baptismal candidates.

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:09.460
This is a very special occasion for you.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.460
Today you will join millions of your brothers and sisters

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.460
in a very special relationship with Jehovah.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.460
I want you to imagine for a moment that you're in a very large stadium

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.460
and there's eight and a half million of your brothers and sisters

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.460
all in this stadium, clapping and so happy

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.460
to see the stand you're taking for Jehovah today.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.460
Some of you are young ones that are raised in the truth

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.460
and you're sitting with your parents and family.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.460
Others of you may have known the truth years ago

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.460
and have recently returned to Jehovah.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.460
Others may have learned the truth recently

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.460
and even under these unusual circumstances

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.460
of a pandemic in Zoom meetings

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.460
have come to the point of dedicating your life to Jehovah.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.460
Whatever your circumstances,

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.459
we are so happy that you've made the decision to get baptized.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:08.459
Now the theme of our talk with you baptism candidates

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:13.459
is exercising faith means everlasting life.

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:17.459
There's two key words here, exercising and faith.

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:23.459
Faith is your trust and confidence in Jehovah and his promises.

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:29.459
And exercising your faith is living your life to do God's will.

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:36.459
You've shown your faith by working hard to qualify for baptism today.

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:40.459
Now faith is a little bit like building a wood fire.

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:42.459
If you want to build a fire,

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:45.459
you first have to collect some small pieces of wood

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:49.459
and then later you need to have on hand some larger pieces of wood

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:51.459
to keep the fire going.

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:58.459
Likewise, your baptism today is the start of your fire of faith.

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:01.459
Now it's not easy to start a fire at times.

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:06.459
The wood may be wet, the wind keeps blowing out your flame.

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:10.460
Likewise, it may not have been easy for you to get the fire of your faith started.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:17.460
You have taken the time and effort to build your fire of faith.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.460
Now you need to keep that fire of faith burning.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.460
Why?

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.460
Well, because our faith can become weak,

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.460
unless we work to keep it strong.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.460
On one occasion, Jesus said to some of his disciples that they had little faith.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.460
Let's look at that in Matthew chapter 17 and verse 20.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:43.050
Matthew 17-20.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.050
He said to them,

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.050
Because of your little faith,

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.050
for truly I say to you,

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.050
if you have faith the size of a mustard grain,

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.050
you will say to this mountain,

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.050
move from here to there,

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.050
and it will move,

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.050
and nothing will be impossible for you.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:08.050
Jesus was letting them know that they needed to make their faith stronger.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.050
Now after a fire gets started,

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.050
it can often get very large and very hot.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.050
But if there's no wood added to the fire, what happens?

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.050
It soon goes out and turns to just cold ashes.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.050
So in order for us to keep our fire of faith burning,

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.050
we need to keep feeding it.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:36.050
Likewise, your fire of faith needs constant attention to keep burning hot and bright.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.050
Let's consider three questions.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.050
One, how can you feed your fire of faith?

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.050
Two, what does it mean to exercise faith?

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:54.050
And three, how will Jehovah reward your faith?

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.050
Before we answer those questions though,

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.050
we will talk to two baptized witnesses

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.050
who have taken steps to make their faith stronger.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.050
First, let's talk to Yoni Palmo.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.050
Brother Palmo and his wife, Ellie,

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.050
serve at Bethel in Finland,

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.050
and he has faithfully served Jehovah for 60 years.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.050
And I want you to note,

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:23.050
what help Brother Palmo face a test of his faith early in his pioneering?

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.050
Brother Palmo, can you recall a time when you had little faith?

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.050
Yes, I can recall,

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.050
when I was 17,

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.050
I moved to serve as an auxiliary pioneer

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.050
with an isolated group far away from my home.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:48.050
There, I faced very religious people who were convinced that we witnesses were wrong

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.050
and that I was badly misled.

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:58.050
There are questions about scriptures I never encountered in my former territory.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.050
The people were very convincing with their arguments

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.050
and I felt confused and lost.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.050
I asked myself, are there other questions too?

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.050
I don't have answers to.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.050
And this started little, my little,

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.050
bothering me and tested my faith.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.050
So there you were, young and isolated with all those questions.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.050
What did you do to strengthen your faith?

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.050
I didn't have bound volumes,

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.050
know what's the library or those kinds of tools.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.050
So I wrote a letter to my Leslie Brothers

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:46.050
who at that time went prison because of refusing military service.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.050
I knew that they had all of our literates there

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:56.420
and they were studying every day the Bible-like scholars.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.420
They saw my situation

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:04.420
and they sent me a letter with answers to all my questions.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.420
I was so happy and thankful to Hova.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:13.420
It really strengthened my faith.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.420
Jehovah used your brothers in prison to help you.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:21.420
So how do you think you benefited from strengthening your faith?

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:27.420
This experience was decisive, a hallmark to my whole spiritual life.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.420
I understood the value of accurate knowledge

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.420
and I started to collect a library of my own.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.420
I still have my early library,

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.420
and to me it is something very special.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.769
This experience happened 56 years ago,

00:06:46.769 --> 00:06:50.769
and since then I have not had any such doubts.

00:06:50.769 --> 00:06:55.769
Jehovah has given us all the answers we need to know.

00:06:55.769 --> 00:06:59.769
And even if there are questions,

00:06:59.769 --> 00:07:02.769
we don't have answers to at the moment.

00:07:02.769 --> 00:07:09.769
I have faith that they will be answered by Jehovah in his due time.

00:07:09.769 --> 00:07:11.769
Thank you, Brother Palmo.

00:07:11.769 --> 00:07:15.769
Your experience really helps us to appreciate the Bible's answers

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:18.769
to life's most complex questions.

00:07:18.769 --> 00:07:23.779
Next we can talk to Frankie Brown.

00:07:23.779 --> 00:07:26.779
Brother Brown and his wife Karen serve at Bethel

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:28.779
in the United States.

00:07:28.779 --> 00:07:31.779
And I want you to pay close attention to what helped Brother Brown

00:07:31.779 --> 00:07:35.779
to make the decision to dedicate his life to Jehovah.

00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:40.779
Brother Brown, can you recall a time when you had little faith?

00:07:40.779 --> 00:07:43.779
Until the age of 12, I was raised by my grandmother

00:07:43.779 --> 00:07:45.779
who studied with Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:07:45.779 --> 00:07:47.779
This is how I was introduced to the truth,

00:07:47.779 --> 00:07:50.779
and I studied off and on growing up.

00:07:50.779 --> 00:07:53.779
At 17, like many young people,

00:07:53.779 --> 00:07:57.779
I faced a decision of what to do with my life after school.

00:07:57.779 --> 00:08:01.779
Many around me just assumed I'd go off to college and pursue a career.

00:08:01.779 --> 00:08:03.779
However, from my study of the Bible,

00:08:03.779 --> 00:08:07.779
I knew I had another choice to make, to serve Jehovah.

00:08:07.779 --> 00:08:09.779
This was a big decision for me.

00:08:09.779 --> 00:08:12.779
At times, I had no idea what I wanted to do.

00:08:12.779 --> 00:08:16.779
I was inexperienced and unsure about whose advice to take.

00:08:16.779 --> 00:08:20.779
The Bibles or that of well-meaning family and friends.

00:08:20.779 --> 00:08:24.779
That's quite a challenging decision for you at that age to make.

00:08:24.779 --> 00:08:27.779
What did you do to strengthen your faith?

00:08:27.779 --> 00:08:30.779
I realized that I needed to know Jehovah better

00:08:30.779 --> 00:08:32.779
and what was involved in serving him.

00:08:32.779 --> 00:08:36.779
So I resumed my Bible study and attendance at Christian meetings.

00:08:36.779 --> 00:08:39.779
I also began to do personal study.

00:08:39.779 --> 00:08:42.779
One personal study project was Psalm 119.

00:08:42.779 --> 00:08:47.779
This beautiful Psalm helped me to view Jehovah as the loving father I never had.

00:08:47.779 --> 00:08:52.779
It also helped me to see the wisdom of living in harmony with the Bible standards.

00:08:52.779 --> 00:08:56.779
For example, Psalm 119.99 says,

00:08:56.779 --> 00:09:03.779
I have more insight than all my teachers because I ponder over your reminders.

00:09:03.779 --> 00:09:08.779
Essentially, the Psalmist was saying that Jehovah was his guidance counselor.

00:09:08.779 --> 00:09:15.779
Also, I benefited from the good example of the brothers and sisters in my congregation.

00:09:15.779 --> 00:09:18.779
They had already made the decision to serve Jehovah.

00:09:18.779 --> 00:09:24.779
And from their life, it was obvious they were truly happy and had a meaningful life.

00:09:24.779 --> 00:09:29.779
This convinced me that serving Jehovah, that was the best way to use my life.

00:09:29.779 --> 00:09:37.779
I thanked Jehovah for their good example and for their efforts to help me at a time when I needed more faith.

00:09:37.779 --> 00:09:44.779
Your personal study and help from the brothers and sisters in your congregation really helped you.

00:09:44.779 --> 00:09:48.779
So how do you think you benefited from strengthening your faith?

00:09:48.779 --> 00:09:54.779
I got baptized, started pioneering, and some years later was invited to Bethel.

00:09:54.779 --> 00:10:00.779
From my youth onward, I have found security and stability in my relationship with Jehovah.

00:10:00.779 --> 00:10:04.779
When I look back on my decision to dedicate my life to Jehovah,

00:10:04.779 --> 00:10:08.779
without a doubt, that's the best decision I've ever made.

00:10:08.779 --> 00:10:13.779
Whether young or old, Jehovah will not let you down when you need him the most.

00:10:13.779 --> 00:10:17.779
Thank you, Brother Brown. You made a good choice.

00:10:17.779 --> 00:10:22.779
Let's go back to our three questions. Consider our first question.

00:10:22.779 --> 00:10:26.779
How can you feed the fire of your faith?

00:10:26.779 --> 00:10:33.779
Well, the Bible is our main source of fuel to feed the fire of our faith.

00:10:33.779 --> 00:10:37.779
To feed the fire of our faith, we need to do two things.

00:10:37.779 --> 00:10:41.779
We need to read God's Word and meditate on it.

00:10:41.779 --> 00:10:46.779
Now, reading God's Word is like adding wood to our fire.

00:10:46.779 --> 00:10:51.779
And meditation is a lot like fanning the flames.

00:10:51.779 --> 00:10:53.779
Let's discuss these one at a time.

00:10:53.779 --> 00:11:03.779
First, let's use the example of the Psalmist in Psalm chapter 1, verses 1 through 3.

00:11:03.779 --> 00:11:06.779
Psalm chapter 1, verses 1 through 3.

00:11:06.779 --> 00:11:13.860
Happy is the man who does not walk according to the advice of the wicked,

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:19.860
and does not stand on the path of sinners, and does not sit in the seat of scoffers.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:27.860
But his delight is in the law of Jehovah, and he reads his law in an undertone day and night.

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:34.860
He will be like a tree planted by streams of water, a tree that produces fruit in its season,

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:41.860
the foliage of which does not wither, and everything he does will succeed.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.860
Well, we want to be like that man in this Psalm.

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:48.860
His delight is in the law of Jehovah.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:52.860
When we find delight or pleasure in reading God's Word,

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:59.860
it's not like we have to read God's Word, we want to read God's Word.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:03.860
He reads his law day and night.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:08.860
Jehovah wants us to read his Word often.

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:12.860
Prayer is when we speak to Jehovah.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:17.860
But reading the Bible is when he speaks to us.

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:24.860
I'd like you to notice the beautiful mental picture that Isaiah gives us of how Jehovah speaks to us,

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:29.860
in Isaiah chapter 30 and verse 21.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:34.860
And your own ears will hear a word behind you saying,

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:38.860
this is the way, walk in it, in case you should go to the right,

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:43.860
or in case you should go to the left.

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:48.860
Well, why do we hear Jehovah's voice behind us instead of in front of us?

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:53.860
Well, for one thing, Jehovah's words in the Bible were written many years ago,

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:58.860
or we could say in the time or past behind us.

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:02.860
But there's another way to visualize this verse.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.860
Maybe you've been with a group, with some small children,

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:09.860
and you're walking somewhere, where often are the children?

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:14.860
They're out in front, running ahead, even if they don't really know where they're going.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:17.860
And what do the parents behind have to do?

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.860
Well, they have to call to them and say, no, no, no, no, no,

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:25.860
not that way, we're going to the left here, and the children run back,

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:30.860
and that's the direction that they go in.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:35.860
Surely we want to listen carefully for Jehovah's voice behind us,

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:40.860
helping us to make the right decisions.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:44.860
Try to schedule Bible reading as part of your daily routine.

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:50.860
As a suggestion, you can use the schedule for Bible reading that's found on jdb.org.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:57.860
To find it, type schedule for Bible reading in the search field at the top right.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:01.860
If you read just three to five chapters every day,

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:06.860
you can complete the entire Bible in just one year.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:10.860
But simply reading God's Word is not enough.

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:15.860
You need to meditate on what you're reading.

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:20.860
Or why should you meditate on what you read in God's Word?

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:28.860
Well, it's because knowing what the right thing is to do and doing it are not the same.

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:32.860
Meditation is the process of converting knowledge.

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:38.860
That is what we know into wise decisions and actions.

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:43.860
The Bible often associates meditation with the heart.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.860
Now, why is that?

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:48.860
Because meditation can convert knowledge.

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:51.860
That is what we know into feelings.

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:56.860
And it is those feelings that drive our actions and decisions.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:01.860
We could kind of think of meditation like a bridge.

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:05.860
On this side of the river, we have knowing what is the right thing to do.

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:08.860
And on this side, we have actually doing it.

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:15.860
Meditation is the bridge that closes the gap between knowing and doing.

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:19.860
And if we find ourselves always kind of knowing what the right thing is to do,

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:21.860
but not actually doing it,

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:28.860
meditation is the bridge to help us close that gap between knowing and doing.

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:33.179
Well, how can you meditate on God's Word?

00:15:33.179 --> 00:15:39.179
Well, after reading a portion of the Bible or one of our publications,

00:15:39.179 --> 00:15:43.179
take a few moments to think deeply about what you have read.

00:15:43.179 --> 00:15:45.179
Ask yourself,

00:15:45.179 --> 00:15:51.179
what do I learn about Jehovah when I read this account?

00:15:51.179 --> 00:15:55.179
How does this account make me feel about Jehovah?

00:15:55.179 --> 00:15:58.179
How can I apply this in my life?

00:15:58.179 --> 00:16:01.179
Or how can I use this to help others?

00:16:01.179 --> 00:16:06.059
So let's review our first question.

00:16:06.059 --> 00:16:10.059
How can you feed the fire of your faith?

00:16:10.059 --> 00:16:14.059
Read and meditate on God's Word each day.

00:16:14.059 --> 00:16:18.659
Let's look at our second question.

00:16:18.659 --> 00:16:22.659
What does it mean to exercise faith?

00:16:22.659 --> 00:16:27.659
Well, Jesus told us that more was required than just believing in Him.

00:16:28.659 --> 00:16:35.659
Let's read John chapter 3 and verse 16 to see the emphasis that Jesus put on exercising faith.

00:16:35.659 --> 00:16:41.330
John chapter 3 and verse 16.

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:46.330
For God loved the world so much that He gave His only begotten Son

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:52.330
so that everyone exercising faith in Him might not be destroyed

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:55.330
but have ever lasting life.

00:16:57.669 --> 00:17:02.669
So what then does it mean to exercise faith?

00:17:02.669 --> 00:17:05.670
A study note on this verse explains

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:15.670
to exercise faith includes the idea of demonstrating one strong beliefs or faith by obeying God.

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:21.670
Now Abraham was a powerful example of proving his faith by obedience.

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:33.339
Let's look at a very wonderful description of Abraham's faith in James chapter 2 and verses 21 through 23.

00:17:33.339 --> 00:17:38.779
James chapter 2 verses 21 through 23.

00:17:38.779 --> 00:17:45.779
Was not Abraham our father declared righteous by works after he offered up Isaac's son on the altar?

00:17:45.779 --> 00:17:53.779
You see that his faith was active along with his works and his faith was perfected by his works.

00:17:53.779 --> 00:18:03.779
And the scripture was fulfilled that says Abraham put faith in Jehovah and it was counted to him as righteousness

00:18:03.779 --> 00:18:07.779
and he came to be called Jehovah's Friend.

00:18:07.779 --> 00:18:14.890
One way read and we meditate on the account of Abraham,

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:22.890
we can feel the emotions that he must have felt and being asked to offer up his son Isaac,

00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:26.890
the only son that he and Sarah had.

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:30.890
How could Abraham make such a very difficult decision?

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:37.890
Well long before this, Abraham had made a decision that he would obey Jehovah and serve him in everything.

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:46.890
And that decision years before to obey Jehovah and all things helped Abraham to make all the other decisions in life clear what he should do.

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:52.890
He did not always have to consider should I do what Jehovah asks or not?

00:18:52.890 --> 00:19:06.420
As difficult a request as it was to offer up his son, Abraham did not delay and took action immediately to obey Jehovah's request.

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:17.420
Now by your baptism today, you're telling everyone that you have dedicated your life to Jehovah to serve and obey him for the rest of your life.

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:27.420
Now let's consider three scriptures and see how you can show your faith by your actions.

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:37.420
Once we read each scripture, we'll consider each scripture as part of your dedication promise and how you can show your faith in action.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:41.420
Our first scripture is Hebrews chapter 10 and verse 25.

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:48.210
Hebrews chapter 10 and verse 25.

00:19:48.210 --> 00:20:02.730
Not forsaking our meetings together as some have the custom, but encouraging one another and all the more so as you see the day drawing near.

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:11.009
Your dedication promise, I will attend all meetings, assemblies and conventions.

00:20:11.009 --> 00:20:14.009
Well how do you show that by faith in action?

00:20:14.009 --> 00:20:22.009
Well you really need a job, but you say no to a job that would mean that you would regularly miss meetings.

00:20:22.009 --> 00:20:26.009
You don't have to decide should I go to meetings or not?

00:20:26.009 --> 00:20:32.009
You've already made that decision when you dedicated yourself to Jehovah.

00:20:32.009 --> 00:20:45.349
Our second scripture at Romans chapter 10 and verse 10.

00:20:45.349 --> 00:20:55.349
For with the heart one exercises faith for righteousness, but with the mouth one makes public declaration for salvation.

00:20:55.349 --> 00:21:01.349
So your dedication promise, I want everyone to know about Jehovah.

00:21:01.349 --> 00:21:09.349
Your faith in action? Well going to bed early so that you can get up for field service the next morning.

00:21:09.349 --> 00:21:12.349
Auxiliary pioneering when you can.

00:21:12.349 --> 00:21:25.430
You schedule field service first and then other activities later in the day or adapting to different forms of the ministry like telephone witnessing or letter writing.

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:43.049
Our third scripture mark chapter 11 and verse 24 mark chapter 11 and verse 24.

00:21:43.049 --> 00:21:54.049
This is why I tell you all the things you pray and ask for have faith that you have received them and you will have them.

00:21:54.049 --> 00:22:00.049
Well your dedication promise, I will constantly seek Jehovah's direction in prayer.

00:22:00.049 --> 00:22:10.049
Your faith in action? When you're tempted to play a violent video game, you reject that game and play something else.

00:22:10.049 --> 00:22:17.049
When faced with a serious illness, you pray for calm and wisdom to make good decisions.

00:22:17.049 --> 00:22:24.049
When you feel yourself getting angry with someone, you pray for self control.

00:22:24.049 --> 00:22:34.049
Now we could use many more scriptures and we could give you many more examples of how you can exercise and show your faith by your actions.

00:22:34.049 --> 00:22:42.049
The point is that you baptismal candidates have dedicated your life to Jehovah and to do his will.

00:22:42.049 --> 00:22:55.049
This one decision to dedicate your life and to live by his standards sets the spiritual and moral foundation for all the decisions you will make from this day forward.

00:22:55.049 --> 00:23:02.549
So let's review our second question. What does it mean to exercise faith?

00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:07.549
We show our faith by our obedience to God.

00:23:07.549 --> 00:23:16.099
Now let's go to our third question. How will Jehovah reward your faith?

00:23:16.099 --> 00:23:25.769
Jehovah loves his faithful worshippers. He wants the best for us and he wants us to be happy.

00:23:25.769 --> 00:23:33.769
Jehovah sees every time you do something to demonstrate your faith, to show faith in action, to be obedient to him.

00:23:34.769 --> 00:23:46.769
Now some feel that God or Jehovah is always watching out for the bad things they do. Maybe keeping a ledger track of all these things bad that a person does.

00:23:46.769 --> 00:23:53.769
But Jehovah is not doing that. He's actually looking for the good and rejoicing in the good that we are doing.

00:23:53.769 --> 00:24:03.769
We could kind of illustrate it the way that many of us are taking so many pictures these days. We all have phones, cameras, we're taking lots of pictures.

00:24:03.769 --> 00:24:13.769
And maybe you've noticed that at one point you take a picture of one of your friends and they have kind of a funny look on their face or they are in the middle of eating something.

00:24:13.769 --> 00:24:19.769
If you show your friend that picture, what do they often say? Could you please delete that?

00:24:19.769 --> 00:24:26.769
That's not the picture they want you to show to other people and that's not the picture you want to show of them.

00:24:26.769 --> 00:24:33.769
Now I want you to imagine for a moment that Jehovah has a digital photo album of you.

00:24:33.769 --> 00:24:37.769
Which pictures do you think he's keeping there?

00:24:37.769 --> 00:24:43.769
The ones where we made serious mistakes? The ones where we did something dumb?

00:24:43.769 --> 00:24:51.769
No, based on your repentance and the ransom sacrifice, those are deleted. They're gone.

00:24:51.769 --> 00:25:02.769
He has in his photo album of you the beautiful pictures, the beautiful moments that he's proud of that you showed your faith in action.

00:25:02.769 --> 00:25:10.769
Jehovah wants to reward your faith in Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 6.

00:25:10.769 --> 00:25:17.769
We can see how Jehovah feels about his servants by what he says here about rewarding them.

00:25:17.769 --> 00:25:21.769
Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 6.

00:25:21.769 --> 00:25:36.769
Moreover, without faith it is impossible to please God well for whoever approaches God must believe that he is and that he becomes the reworder of those earnestly seeking him.

00:25:36.769 --> 00:25:53.240
So when listing all these other examples of faith there in chapter 11 of Hebrews, the Apostle Paul pauses for a moment to remind us that Jehovah becomes the reworder of those earnestly seeking him.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:26:02.240
Now when you take the time and effort to build a fire, what reward do you get in return?

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:10.240
Well you get the warmth and light of that fire. You can keep yourself and others warm by the fire.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:16.240
And a fire gives off a beautiful light that can be very welcome on a dark night.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:21.240
The sounds of a crackling fire can make us feel safe and happy.

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:29.519
How will Jehovah reward his faithful worshipers for their fire of faith?

00:26:29.519 --> 00:26:33.519
Well ultimately he will reward us with everlasting life.

00:26:33.519 --> 00:26:41.829
During his ministry, Jesus repeatedly promised that his faithful servants would get everlasting life.

00:26:41.829 --> 00:26:51.829
Just as Jehovah provided the rewards of a wood fire, he also provides many gifts that come when we build and feed our fire of faith.

00:26:51.829 --> 00:26:55.829
Consider some of the rewards that Jehovah gives us now.

00:26:55.829 --> 00:27:01.829
The reward of his word, the Bible, gives us the best advice for life.

00:27:01.829 --> 00:27:06.829
It lights our way in a spiritually dark world.

00:27:06.829 --> 00:27:12.829
The reward of the ministry, the most satisfying work that we can do.

00:27:12.829 --> 00:27:23.829
The reward of Holy Spirit, a powerful helper in times of trials, remember you are never alone.

00:27:23.829 --> 00:27:31.829
And the reward of our loving group of brothers and sisters around the world, a source of great warmth and comfort.

00:27:31.829 --> 00:27:37.430
In conclusion, let's review our three questions.

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:42.430
1. How can you feed your fire of faith?

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:46.430
Read and meditate on God's word each day.

00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:51.430
2. What does it mean to exercise faith?

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:55.430
We show our faith by our obedience to God.

00:27:55.430 --> 00:28:01.710
3. How will Jehovah reward your faith?

00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:03.710
Everlasting life.

00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:10.920
Please take note of this day. Remember it. Write it down.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:17.920
Each time you hear baptism talk in the future, take that opportunity to reflect on your baptism.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:26.920
And the many blessings that you have received because of the decision that you made to dedicate your life to Jehovah.

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:30.920
Jehovah, want you to be happy and to enjoy life.

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:43.519
All 8.5 million plus of your brothers and sisters that are watching this program are with you and heart and mind, and we want you to be happy.

00:28:43.519 --> 00:28:54.519
Keep clear in mind, though, that happiness is not something that you can buy for yourself or get for yourself or you can't get it by loving yourself.

00:28:54.519 --> 00:29:07.519
Just like the warmth and light are byproducts of a wood fire, so to happiness is a byproduct of faith and love for others and for Jehovah.

00:29:08.519 --> 00:29:16.019
We could say that happiness is the warmth and glow from love's fire.

00:29:16.019 --> 00:29:22.019
The world will tell you you can follow your dreams. You can be anything you want to be.

00:29:22.019 --> 00:29:27.019
But it is far better to let Jehovah dream for you.

00:29:27.019 --> 00:29:35.019
Your life serving Jehovah can be far greater than anything you could dream up for yourself.

00:29:35.019 --> 00:29:44.019
Please, from this day forward, be determined to keep feeding and exercising your faith.
