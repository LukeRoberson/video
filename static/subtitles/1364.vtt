In 2001, with the governing body's approval, our brothers in France started using a variety

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:12.640
of methods to carry out our public witnessing, including the use of carts.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.120
The trial resulted in many good experiences.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:26.050
As a result, in 2011, a pilot project with cart witnessing in New York City, USA, was approved.

00:00:26.129 --> 00:00:31.890
Since Manhattan and New York City had a ratio of one Jova's witness to 657 inhabitants,

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:37.570
this was a perfect choice. That was the beginning of a pilot program in Manhattan.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.829
The program lasted one year, using many graduates from what was then the school for Christian

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:50.750
couples. Although different tables were used at the time, it was evident that a mobile card

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:57.229
had many advantages. As a result, today, Jova's witnesses are well known for their public witnessing,

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:02.750
using carts designed to display their literature. By means of this method, good news from the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.709
Bible can be taken to many places and easily becomes available to countless people.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.870
These carts include different posters that, call attention to our well-known publications,

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:23.069
invite people to accept free home Bible studies, and direct passers-by to our official website.

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:28.269
Here are just a few examples of how this method has had many good results.

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:36.510
My name is Mi Jong Yu. The first time I met Jova's witnesses was more than 20 years ago.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:42.750
I started studying in the You Can Live Forever book, but about a month later, I had to stop studying.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.909
After that, I would accept the magazines, but I never ended up studying the Bible again.

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:56.430
In June of 2014, though, I saw the public witnessing stand. I realized that it belonged to

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.150
Jova's witnesses. So many of the different publications they had caught my eye, so I asked if it

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.469
would be okay if I took a copy of each one. We ended up exchanging numbers, and a few weeks later,

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:16.990
the brother contacted me. I began studying the Bible again with the couple, and one month later,

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:24.430
started attending meetings regularly. I was baptized in October of 2015, and started

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.590
auxiliary pioneering right away for 10 months. Now I'm serving as a regular pioneer. Public

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.270
witnessing helped me find the truth, and it's a way for me to meet people that are interested

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.909
like I was. I have really come to cherish the public witnessing work.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.870
My name is Rakob Salome. I work as a driver and spend most of my life traveling all over Peru.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.830
Because of this, I had problems with the woman I was living with. I never spent time at home and

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:06.500
practically lived in the truck. I would see Jova's witnesses preaching on the streets near the buses,

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.939
but since I was always driving, I couldn't park or even talk to them.

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:19.219
But once I saw some witnesses preaching in a public square, so I went up to them to ask them what

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:30.240
the Bible says about family matters. This marked a change in my life. My girlfriend and I began

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:39.409
attending meetings, and then we got married, and got baptized. Now we are Jova's witnesses.

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:48.319
As Annie's and I were standing by our cart, we met Young Sudarshan. Annie showed him our

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.439
tract. Can the dead really live again? He was surprised and said, how is it possible?

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.719
When she explained to him, Acts 24-15, he exclaimed, I am a Christian. I never knew this.

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:07.280
I asked him, would you like to learn more about such wonderful things from the Bible? He asked,

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.840
can you tell me right now? There and then I discussed the first chapter of the

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:19.680
Teachbook. That's how it started. Sudarshan bought his friend Saga. Saga in turn brought Shiva

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:26.000
and Shrikant along. Three of them are attending our meetings regularly. Saga even turned down a

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.240
job offer that conflicted with Bible principles. One tract resulted in many Bible studies.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.399
We can really see Jehovah's blessing on this form of public witnessing.
