WEBVTT

00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:11.859
We meet people of different nationalities from different countries, it's really fabulous.

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:18.859
We have read about the international conventions and we imagine something beautiful.

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:23.859
The Hova's weaknesses are not a national religion but an international family.

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:29.859
And your conventions of Jehovah's Witnesses are joyful occasions that focus on Bible education,

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:40.859
often attracting the attention of media outlets around the world.

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:45.859
Every few years, Jehovah's Witnesses hold international conventions in selected cities.

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:48.859
And delegates from various countries are invited to attend.

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:56.859
What move these witnesses to travel so far at their own expense in order to attend these international conventions?

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:00.859
The reason I really wanted to attend this particular international convention is,

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:05.859
in 1958, my mother attended an international convention held in New York,

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:10.859
hollow grounds, Yankee Stadium, over 200,000 attended that convention.

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:13.859
And for her, it was one of the highlights of her life.

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:17.859
She's spoken about it in the past 50 years as such an incredible event,

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:21.859
seeing people from all nations come and learn about the Bible.

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:25.859
So when I had the opportunity, there was no way I was going to miss it.

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:31.859
So here we are today to fill again the love and the unity of the whole Brotherhood.

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:38.859
Witnesses attribute this unity to their personal study of the Bible and Bible-based publications.

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:45.859
The witnesses are known for their work of translating, printing and distributing Bibles and Bible study materials,

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:49.859
now available in over 500 languages.

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:57.859
Convention delegates comment on how such literature and study led to positive changes in their lives.

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:02.859
Before I became one of Jehovah's Witnesses, I was a member of a gang,

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:05.859
and I was basically of no real use to society.

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:09.860
After I studied the Bible, I became a person that can help others.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.860
Now, I'm a boss of a company, and I help others to understand the Bible.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.860
In my case, I was raised in a family where male chauvinism ruled.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:28.860
I started studying the Bible when I was 17, and thanks to that, I learned that Jesus loves everyone, including women.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.860
Thanks to the Bible, I am a happier person, and I learned to treat my wife lovingly.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.860
Besides, my dad is getting baptized.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.860
For 37 years, he was an alcoholic and addicted to drugs,

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.860
but he broke all of his habits when he started to study the Bible.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:57.860
And today, he's a better father, a happier husband, and my mother has gone in love with him again.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:04.860
He was a professional boxer, and I was involved with different kinds of lives, a morality.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.860
You name it all kind of dirty behavior, I was in it.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.860
But being one of the Jehovah's Witnesses, I've learned a lot.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.860
I used to be a violent person, but it's different now from what I've been taught through the Bible.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.860
So actually, it's been wonderful being one of the Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:31.860
After many months of Bible study, new members of the faith may qualify to be baptized as Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:39.860
Dali gets say that becoming one of Jehovah's Witnesses is a personal choice that is made on an individual basis.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.860
Everyone has the right to decide what they want to do with their life, like I did.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.860
Although we are parents of Jehovah's Witnesses, we have made the decision ourselves.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:57.860
To study the Bible ourselves, even though we had a family study, we studied ourselves, we could speak to other people.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.860
Studying the Bible doesn't teach us to be judgmental of others.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.860
As I said, my mom is a Roman Catholic.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.860
My sister belongs to an Epicostal religion, but I still treat them with love.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.860
I have more love for them now after studying the Bible than I had before I knew anything about the Bible.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.860
Jehovah's Witnesses are not a sect, they are not fanatic people.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:25.860
As many people have a wrong notion about them, but they are just ordinary people who are just following the principles in the Bible.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:33.860
When arranging for their conventions, Jehovah's Witnesses work closely with government authorities and local business people.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.860
Very well organized, I am so amazed to see how well organized they are.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:45.860
Everything is being scheduled and on time everything is being looked after, down to the very little details that actually are quite important.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:58.860
Something outstanding about the Witnesses is how organized they are and how respectful they are toward the government, national institutions and other religious groups.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:12.860
I have references from coworkers who say, don't worry about these people are very organized, they don't leave garbage in public areas and you won't have problems with them.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:21.860
The way they present themselves, the way they behave in the park, the way they follow rules, you don't even have to tell them that these are the rules which govern behavior in the park.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.860
They know what is expected of them, so we never have any issue at all with them.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:34.860
Whenever I had an interaction with them, I was very humble, very understanding and it's a pleasure to deal with Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:47.860
This brief report featured interviews with just a few of the more than 7 million Jehovah's Witnesses who gather peacefully for Bible education in 236 lands around the world.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:53.860
They share a bond that transcends barriers of nationality, culture and language.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:06:04.860
Jehovah's Witnesses happily attend these conventions that help them to become better fathers, mothers and children, better workers and schoolmates and better citizens.
