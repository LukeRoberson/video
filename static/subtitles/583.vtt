00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.580
The expression used in our day's text, the word used, is over-reached.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.580
And what comes to mind when we hear someone that has been over-reached?

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.579
Well, to over-reach means to get better off, or get the better off,

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:25.579
especially by deceit or trickery, to outwit, to overtake, to over-power.

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:31.579
And so we have to be very careful at all times, because our enemy, the devil,

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:38.579
is out to trick us, deceive us, overtake us on any occasion possible.

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.579
And he has quite a variety of tactics, doesn't he?

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:49.579
In fact, the Bible in Ephesians 6-11 describes these as the crafty acts of the devil.

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:55.579
Now, our context of today's text in the background helps us to illustrate just two of those tactics.

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.579
We invite you to open your Bibles to sect of Corinthians 2.

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:07.579
And in Paul's first letter to the Corinthians, the congregation had been affected by a man

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:14.579
who had been over-reached by Satan, being involved in very gross sexual immorality.

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:20.579
When on top of his being over-reached, the congregation was tolerating it.

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:23.579
And so what did Paul tell them in very clear terms?

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:31.579
You must hand such a man over to Satan, remove the wicked person from among you.

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:40.579
Well, the congregation responded, and eventually this very man who had been living such an immoral life really repented.

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:50.579
And now permissiveness and tolerating badness was no longer the issue, what was the issue?

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.579
Now a matter of forgiving such a man.

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.579
In 2 Corinthians 2, we read verse 6,

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:02.579
this rebuke given by the majority is sufficient for such a man.

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:09.580
Now you should instead kindly forgive and comfort him so that he may not be overwhelmed

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.580
by excessive sadness.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.580
And who was behind that ploy of excessive sadness, verse 11,

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:25.580
so that we may not be over-reached by Satan for we are not ignorant of his designs.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:32.580
So the devil will use whatever, the temptation of sexual immorality,

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:41.580
being overly permissive, or being harsh, unforgiving, and lacking mercy.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:49.580
Both of those tactics can be very effective in taking Jehovah's people away from their Heavenly Father.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.580
But on this matter of temptations when it comes to sexual immorality,

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.580
let's just briefly talk about another tactic that the devil uses.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:08.580
He can convince someone that they can taste or toy with things that might be unclean or are unclean,

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.580
but there will be no lasting harm or no serious consequences to that.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:22.580
They may even touch something unclean and nothing apparently bad has happened and they conclude that it's okay.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:28.580
But such a person is forgetting the unchangeable law of Jehovah as recorded in Galatians 6.7.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.580
Whatever a man is soying, this he will also reap.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:40.580
Now, just illustrate that how the devil can use bait and convince somebody that they're not really into any kind of trouble,

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.580
and yet he will catch them.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.580
We're going to tell you an account that goes back many years.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:52.580
There was a group of young men at a freshwater lake and they were fishing.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:59.580
And they could look down into this lake and they could see these big bass, beautiful fish.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.580
And they tried all sorts of lures.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:10.580
They tried worms on hooks, artificial lures. Those big fish would not bite.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.580
But then an older gentleman came along and he said, give me one of your worms.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.579
And he took the worm without the hook and he threw it out in the vicinity where these big bass were.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.579
And a bass came and he took the worm.

00:04:23.579 --> 00:04:27.579
He said, throw another one without the hook.

00:04:27.579 --> 00:04:29.579
Throw it, the bass took it.

00:04:29.579 --> 00:04:34.579
And now he said, put the worm on the hook and cast.

00:04:34.579 --> 00:04:37.579
The fish was caught.

00:04:37.579 --> 00:04:39.579
What is the lesson?

00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:43.579
The devil will give us bait sometimes and it appears that it's very pleasurable.

00:04:43.579 --> 00:04:46.579
There's nothing wrong here. It's harmless.

00:04:46.579 --> 00:04:57.579
But with the devil, there's always the hook, always the hook that can cause spiritual, emotional, mental, and even physical harm.

00:04:57.579 --> 00:05:05.579
It can literally cost us our life if we get tricked to thinking that uncleanness will not hurt us.

00:05:05.579 --> 00:05:15.579
Now, besides pleasure and the temptations that go with that, the devil will also use pain and suffering.

00:05:15.579 --> 00:05:22.579
For example, in the experience of Job, he lost his material possessions.

00:05:22.579 --> 00:05:26.579
He lost his children. He got very ill.

00:05:26.579 --> 00:05:30.579
That caused all sorts of physical and emotional pain.

00:05:30.579 --> 00:05:33.579
Not pleasure.

00:05:33.579 --> 00:05:44.579
And with all that he was going through, then his so-called friends come to comfort him and they accuse him of all sorts of bad attitudes and actions.

00:05:44.579 --> 00:05:53.930
And they even put doubts in Job's mind or try to that Jehovah couldn't be pleased anyway.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.930
Well, that was one of the toughest tests that he faced.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.930
This from with his friends and the words that they said.

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:14.930
Well, commenting on this, the August 15th, 2002 watchtower said this about how a great test can come from our fellow worshipers.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:23.930
It says this, Satan still makes use of misguided counsel or thoughtless spring marks from friends and fellow believers.

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:32.930
Discouragement from within the congregation can undermine our morale more easily than persecution from without.

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:40.930
And then this article went on to explain that there was a brother serving as an elder, but he had seen active combat in the army.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.930
There were two terrible things.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:55.930
But when he faced criticism, thoughtless remarks, and was hurt by his fellow workers in the congregation, what did he say about those tests within the congregation?

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:02.930
He says, it's the hardest thing I've ever been through in my life.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.930
So what can the devil use?

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:16.930
You can say or do things sometimes, and the devil will play on that and amplify that and cause one to stop serving Jehovah.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:23.930
Well, obviously there's a variety of crafty acts, and we've only covered just a couple of them this morning.

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.930
But what do we do to protect ourselves?

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:34.930
James 4.7 says, therefore, subject yourselves to God, but oppose the devil.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:46.930
When we do that, we always must remember the model prayer given by Jesus, where he said, deliver us from the wicked one.

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.930
Now, why is that so important?

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:58.930
Well, we bear Jehovah's name, and he is very anxious to protect his name, and he loves us very much.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:11.930
And like any loving father, if he saw one of his faithful sons going through a terrible trial by someone that was trying to kill him, that father would respond quickly, wouldn't he?

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.930
Well, how does Jehovah feel about us?

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:29.930
Well, let's open our Bibles to the book of Malachi, and just re-emphasize how much Jehovah cares for us, and why he would respond so quickly to our Christ for help to deliver us from the wicked one.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:38.929
In Malachi 3 and verse 17, it says, and they will be mine, says Jehovah of armies.

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:50.929
In the day when I produce a special property, I will show them compassion just as a man shows compassion to his son, who serves him.

00:08:50.929 --> 00:08:54.929
Well, that warm arrangement there, isn't it?

00:08:54.929 --> 00:08:56.929
And Jehovah cares for us.

00:08:56.929 --> 00:09:01.929
Other Bible translations, when it talks about special property, use these expressions.

00:09:01.929 --> 00:09:09.929
My very own, my most prized possession, my jewels. Jehovah loves us.

00:09:10.929 --> 00:09:21.929
And Jehovah will only allow the devil to go so far in testing us, only according to what Jehovah wills at the moment, for example.

00:09:21.929 --> 00:09:32.929
Remember in the case of Job, when fire came down from heaven, and consumed Job's flock of sheep, and even some of his servants, the devil calls that fire.

00:09:33.929 --> 00:09:45.929
But later in 1 Kings chapter 18, at the fire test at Mount Carmel, when there were two bulls, and the idea was to figure out who is the true God.

00:09:45.929 --> 00:09:56.929
Jehovah or a bale, and those bale worshipers went from morning to night, crying out to their false god, and not one flicker of flame could be produced.

00:09:56.929 --> 00:10:05.929
Jehovah would not allow the devil to even burn up one bull, in contrast to what he had done with all those many sheep.

00:10:05.929 --> 00:10:08.929
Jehovah is in control.

00:10:08.929 --> 00:10:22.929
And what Jehovah allows today, we can be sure, whatever he allows the devil to do, to cause this emotional pain, physical pain, to even persecute us, perhaps even kill some of us.

00:10:23.929 --> 00:10:31.929
By means of his son Christ Jesus, Jehovah has made a way to break up the works of the devil completely.

00:10:31.929 --> 00:10:40.929
So whatever happens, when we stay loyal to Jehovah, and we are on guard against the crafty acts of the devil, we will not be overreached.

00:10:40.929 --> 00:10:47.929
No permanent harm can come to Jehovah's people by this deceitful treacherous enemy.

00:10:47.929 --> 00:10:54.929
May all of us continue to stay on the alert. Be mindful of the devil's tactics.

00:10:54.929 --> 00:11:01.929
Beg Jehovah to deliver us, and then we can be confident that our loving Heavenly Father will never abandon us.
