00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:08.240
Although many of our construction projects are the result of growth in a branch territory,

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:15.720
our donations also are put to good use when disaster strike.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.920
The organization is quick to respond to the needs of our brothers and sisters in affected

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.640
areas.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.600
This includes the distribution of release supplies.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:35.200
It also involves helping our brothers repair or rebuild their homes and kingdom halls.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:44.280
This was the case in 2011 when a large tornado ripped through the state of Missouri in the

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.090
United States.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.729
When a disaster strikes, the disaster relief does take the lead in caring for the needs

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:53.969
of the field.

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.329
This is done by using volunteers.

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.490
Our brothers know how to work together.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.409
We're using volunteers that are used to crawling over each other and working in a kingdom hall.

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:08.450
So they have the ability to get into a disaster situation and take direction and just take

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.450
care of it.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.969
It's an evaluation process to see what's needed.

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:17.209
Then the purchasing department locally will then go ahead and start buying materials.

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:21.890
Those will be delivered and volunteers will come to prepare the home back to livable

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.450
conditions so that our brothers and sisters can get back into their homes.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.609
So we stabilize the friends, we stabilize the houses, and we can stabilize the congregation.

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:35.290
We had a group of brothers that went in to drop them as early after the tornado destroyed

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.810
30% of the city.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.650
We had probably 30, 40 volunteers working on the house.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.329
And a woman comes down the street from the neighborhood.

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:46.569
She sees all the volunteers working.

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:48.370
She thinks it's a construction organization.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.010
She says, can I pay you to come over and fix my garage?

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.329
It was basically a shed that had been picked up off the slab and turned upside down and

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.090
moved a few feet away from the slab.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.090
So the brothers said, well, let's go take a look at it.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.450
So they went over and they took a look at it.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.090
It wasn't that hard.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.530
The shed was still intact.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.530
They said, we could do this in a few minutes.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.849
So they went and got all their volunteers.

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.330
They went over, they picked the shed up.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.770
They got about 30 brothers on it and they turned it over and put it on the slab.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.810
And the woman was so thankful.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.289
She says, OK, so what do I owe you?

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:20.729
They said, no, we're all volunteers.

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:21.729
We're joeous witnesses.

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:25.250
We're working through the local kingdom hall here, a relief center.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.409
And she says, you're kidding me.

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:28.210
You're all volunteers.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.009
She says, yeah.

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:30.009
And we're out.

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:31.009
She says, what are you doing here?

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:36.050
So we're out working on our brothers and sisters' homes and trying to help them get stabilized.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.610
She was in tears.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.449
She came back down the street a few minutes later with a lot of money in her hand.

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:44.090
She said, I want to tell you a story.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.729
She says, I called my church after this happened.

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:53.210
And I asked them to come work, do this work for me, to put this shed back on its slab.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.530
They said, we can do that.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.490
We'll be there in about three weeks and it's going to cost you this much.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.930
She says, and here you folks come over to my house.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.169
You don't charge me.

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:05.210
You don't even know who I am.

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.330
And you put my home back together.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.370
What I needed have done, she says, here's the money.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.370
You have this.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.810
You put it in your contribution box.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.729
When someone helps in building a kingdom hall, when someone helps in building an assembly

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:26.650
hall, when someone aids in caring for a natural disaster, their lives are changed forever.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:36.229
When someone is benefited by one of these programs, their lives are changed forever.

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:44.590
The love demonstrated in the organization is truly faith strengthening to see.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.229
The same arrangement to respond to disasters is in place all around the world.
