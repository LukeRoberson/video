00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.140
Right now I'm serving in the Central America branch and I have the opportunity to work

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.699
with extraordinary brothers and sisters, both here and in other parts of the world.

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:15.699
My name is Rogelio.

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:21.289
I'm part of the art department and I'm a digital illustrator.

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.609
Music really means the world to me.

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:24.769
I am Joyce.

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:33.070
I am a pioneer and I sing Alta in the Bethel Corus.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.350
My name is Lulen and I serve as a regular pioneer in a congregation where there's a need.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.869
I love doing that.

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:42.549
My life is wonderful.

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:47.710
Seeing people's faces light up when you teach them God's name or when you tell them of Jehovah's

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.829
promises for us, fills me with great joy.

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:53.630
My name is Jose Marten.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:59.939
I serve as a regular pioneer and as an elder in the congregation.

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:05.219
Ever since I was little, I've always loved playing soccer and that was my biggest dream.

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:08.540
My goal was to become a professional soccer player.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.019
The truth is, setting goals was always difficult for me because I always had two passions.

00:01:14.019 --> 00:01:18.739
Am I a servant of Jehovah or an artist?

00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:22.620
My goal was to become the best gymnast in the world.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.250
At that moment, gymnastics were number one in my life.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:36.810
I played at big festivals, standing ovation, that was amazing.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.930
I was surrounded by non-witnesses using drugs, smoking, swearing.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.969
My trainer had mapped out a complete training program with the Olympics as a goal.

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:52.129
This would make me feel trapped.

00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:55.810
I started thinking, what do I want to do with my life?

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.849
More importantly, what does Jehovah want?

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:02.370
When I was studying design, I was already a regular pioneer.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.769
It wasn't easy for me to come to the understanding that the one who really matters is Jehovah.

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:13.770
When I was 16 years old, different teams started offering me high-paying contracts.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:20.770
I felt a lot of pressure and it was a temptation because they would constantly call me and come to my house.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.770
I noticed that when the players played the sport, they were happy.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.770
But afterwards, they weren't.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.770
My mother was in the full-time service and I saw her happiness.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.770
That motivated me because I too wanted to experience that lasting happiness.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.770
I felt a little guilty when I thought of how much of myself I was giving to design and art and all of that.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.770
So that's when I made my decision.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.770
I decided to leave university and focus on my service.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.770
I realized that for a long time, I hadn't been growing spiritually.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.770
I prayed intensely to Jehovah.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.020
I asked, do I know you?

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.030
Do I live the way you would want?

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:16.460
And after that, I stopped performing with non-witnesses.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.460
I prayed to Jehovah.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:24.460
And then, at the convention, we received a DVD young people ask, what will I do with my life?

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:30.280
That really was Jehovah's answer to my prayers.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.280
In the Bible, it says that the truth will set you free.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.280
That freedom is something I never used to feel.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:47.280
I love working together with other sisters in the ministry to see how they share my enthusiasm for making return visits and conducting Bible studies.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.280
It's just wonderful to see.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.280
To wake up each day, knowing that I'm going to do something new for Jehovah is extraordinary.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.280
It's an unbelievable blessing. It's like living a dream.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.280
I feel that I belong to a global organization and we are all going in the same direction.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.280
It's something really wonderful for me.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.280
To sing for Jehovah is the most beautiful privilege I could ever imagine.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.279
One of the biggest blessings is that I have a real friendship with Jehovah.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:24.279
Friendship with my brothers and sisters, young or old, it doesn't matter.

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:30.279
I am really happy that when Jehovah looks at me, I feel his approval.

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:33.279
That makes me happy.

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:36.279
My trust in Jehovah has grown stronger.

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:39.279
The way I communicate with him continues to improve.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:46.279
And I also love my assignment of being a regular pioneer and elder and to be able to support the brothers and sisters.

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:53.279
To continue to be among Jehovah's people, that's the joy I was looking for and I found it.
