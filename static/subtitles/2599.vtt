00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:05.650
Now, just looking at our text, which is taken from Acts 1, verse 8,

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.689
we suddenly see a distinct connection between power and Holy Spirit.

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:15.089
And that combination guarantees a successful outcome,

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.530
because the verse goes on to say,

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.609
you will be witnesses of me to the most distant part of the earth.

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.609
Now, the study note explains that the expression Holy Spirit

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.010
appears 41 times in the book of Acts,

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.850
and that makes it clear again and again that the international preaching work

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.929
is only successful because of the power of Jehovah's Holy Spirit.

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:41.289
But a personal question,

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:49.289
how does an unseen active force give me power to accomplish tasks associated with this work?

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.729
When you think about it, the Bible metaphorically describes Holy Spirit as God's hand

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.729
or His fingers. For example, Psalm 19, verse 1,

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:02.409
describes the skies as the work of God's hand.

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:06.329
And Psalm 8, verse 3 refers to the moon and stars

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:09.530
as the works of God's fingers.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.450
Now, our hands and fingers are a wonderful gift from Jehovah,

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:20.489
and today we will use them in a variety of ways to accomplish our various individual skills.

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:24.090
But whatever natural abilities we possess,

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.530
Holy Spirit can give us the power to take these abilities to a higher level.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.530
And since Jehovah used Holy Spirit to create the skies,

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.329
we could say that the skies the limit

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.370
as far as the potential is concerned for Jehovah to expand our abilities.

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:47.849
Now, let's just consider the power that Jesus has today because of Holy Spirit.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.370
At Revelation chapter 3, verse 1, Jesus is described as having

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.609
the seven spirits of God.

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:03.450
Now, our publications have explained that those seven spirits symbolise Jesus' ability to observe

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.290
and discern everyone and everything throughout the earth.

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.330
Now, think about that as we look at the illustration on the screen.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.289
With the earth's population estimated to hit 8 billion around November 2022,

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:27.449
Jesus has the ability to scrutinize every individual from the vantage point of his throne in heaven.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.569
As a perfect judge, he will divide the world's population into sheep and goats during the great

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:40.169
tribulation, and every single assessment will be right and just.

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.409
And as we also see illustrated following that judgment,

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:50.169
Holy Spirit will give Jesus the power to execute divine judgments at the battle of Armageddon.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.250
Now, when you think of all that power unleashed at Armageddon,

00:02:54.969 --> 00:03:00.569
and not one single casualty amongst those who Jesus has identified as a sheep,

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:08.889
now that just shows you that Jesus possessing the seven spirits of God gives him a tremendous amount

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:16.250
of power. Now, while we will never have or even need Jesus' powers, what does that do for us?

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:24.009
It instills confidence that even a tiny amount of God's spirit can give us the power to fulfill

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:32.569
our assignments. Now, let's consider the example of two humans, mentioned in Exodus chapter 35.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:40.409
And these two humans are Bezilell and Oholyab. These two men were involved in the furnishing of

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:51.050
the Tabernacle. And if we look at verse 35, I'm sorry, verse 31, it says, he, that's Jehovah, has

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:59.289
filled him, that's Bezilell, with the spirit of God giving him wisdom, understanding, and knowledge

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:07.370
of every sort of craftsmanship. And then in verse 35, it says, he, again, Jehovah, has filled them

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:14.650
this time, including Bezilell and Oholyab, filled them with skill. Or as the footnote says,

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:23.850
a wisdom of heart to do all the work of a craftsman. So these two men probably had a knowledge of

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:32.730
crafts before assigned to these skilled tasks. However, God's spirit filled them with wisdom,

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:38.970
understanding, and knowledge why to accomplish the work to a higher standard.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:45.930
The fact that the Tabernacle existed for nearly 500 years is surely a credit to their

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:53.930
workmanship. Now in our day, the gift of Holy Spirit has a fundamentally different objective.

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:00.810
It is to perform spiritual works, the preaching, and teaching work described in Acts chapter 1 verse 8,

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:07.529
but also shepherding, counseling, and guiding the congregations. But nevertheless,

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:14.730
the formula for success is the same as it was for Bezilell and Oholyab. When Jehovah gives us

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:22.649
Holy Spirit, we grow in wisdom, understanding, and knowledge. And in turn, God's finger

00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:30.009
enhances natural talents and abilities, taking them to another level. Now let's look at our next

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:40.939
slide and what do you see here? Verse 32 explains that these talented men worked with gold,

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:48.620
silver, and copper. Now these are separate skills. A goldsmith, a silversmith, and a copper

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:55.180
smith learn different techniques, and they require different training. Now don't you think that's

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:02.459
quite amazing for one man or two men to possess all those skills in order to produce artistic

00:06:02.459 --> 00:06:10.779
designs, as the verse says. And then verse 33 adds they made all kind of artistic wood products.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:16.939
Not just any old wood and piece, but artistic products. What a combination of skills.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:24.459
These men possess the ability to work with metals and wood and produce some outstanding products.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:33.850
Now it's quite common for an artist to initial his works. Where any of those artistic products

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:40.810
carved with the initial B for bezel L, so that over the next 500 years people would know who made it.

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:48.410
Or was there a large letter O for Oholyab woven into the fabrics? Of course not.

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:55.769
Because these humble men knew that their level of craftsmanship was down to Holy Spirit.

00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:03.449
Now actually not all of the designs may have been attributed to them. If we look at verse 34,

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:10.889
it tells us that they were encouraged to teach. So they teach and explain their skills to other people.

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:16.970
That means there was quite a number of unnamed talented individuals who worked on the tabernacle

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:24.490
and who learned artistic skills from bezel L and Oholyab. Now herein lies a very interesting lesson

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:32.170
for all who receive the gift of Holy Spirit. And it's a lesson that Paul taught in Galatians chapter 5.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:40.889
So Galatians chapter 5 lists various aspects of the fruitage of the Spirit. But then Paul offers

00:07:40.889 --> 00:07:47.209
this warning in verse 26 to those who develop the fruitage. He says, let us not become

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:53.769
egotistical stirring up competition with one another, envying one another.

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:58.970
Well there's various things mentioned there, but just let's focus on the word egotistical.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:06.329
An egotist has a strong desire to receive praise from others, one who so to speak like

00:08:06.329 --> 00:08:12.089
his initials carved in such a way against his accomplishments so that people will recognize

00:08:12.089 --> 00:08:19.850
who did the work. And yet when we consider it so much is accomplished today by unnamed individuals

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:27.529
here at Bethel and the thousands of remote workers. Even those whose work is obvious to others

00:08:27.529 --> 00:08:34.490
don't seek fame. Let's think of an example. What do you think about the standard of acting that

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:39.690
goes into the convention videos? It's amazing and quite outstanding, isn't it? Our brothers

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:45.850
have shown some outstanding skills. And yet our brothers and sisters don't play the parts using

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:52.970
their own real names. Nor are there credits that the end of each supports symposium for those

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:59.289
in front and even behind the camera. We certainly don't have awards ceremonies every year for the

00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:04.889
best video, the best actor, the best actress, the best costume designer, the best producer,

00:09:04.889 --> 00:09:11.690
and so on and so forth. None of that, because we all accept that Jehovah takes even natural

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:20.009
talents to a higher level by using his finger, his Holy Spirit. So what can we say in conclusion?

00:09:20.889 --> 00:09:25.049
When we develop skills, we rightly feel deep satisfaction,

00:09:26.009 --> 00:09:31.929
knowing that God's finger is at work in our lives, giving us the power to perform our various

00:09:31.929 --> 00:09:38.169
assignments. But at the same time, we are quick to acknowledge that whatever natural talents and

00:09:38.169 --> 00:09:46.330
abilities we possess, Jehovah takes them to a higher level by means of his finger, his Holy Spirit.
