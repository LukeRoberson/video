00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:10.570
and introduction to the book of Hosea. Hosea served as a prophet to the Ten Tribe Kingdom of Israel,

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:18.570
and his prophecies were directed mainly to that nation. His contemporaries Micah and Isaiah

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:27.570
served as prophets to the southern kingdom of Judah. Hosea began his service no later than 804 BCE

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.570
during the reign of King Jarabon II. His career as a prophet continued for about 60 years until

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:43.570
sometime after 745 BCE when he completed the book bearing his name. Hosea prophesied amid great

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:54.250
political turmoil. Four kings of Israel were assassinated during this period. The book of Hosea

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:02.250
has 14 chapters. Chapters 1 to 3 use Hosea's family life to dramatize Jehovah's dealings with Israel.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:10.250
Jehovah tells Hosea to marry a woman who would later commit adultery repeatedly. Hosea

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:17.250
marries Gomer who becomes unfaithful to him. Hosea's marriage to Gomer pictures Jehovah's

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:24.250
marriage to Israel by means of the Mosaic law covenant. Gomer's unfaithful conduct pictures

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.250
Israel's betrayal of Jehovah by turning to the worship of false gods and forming political

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:37.250
alliances with pagan nations. Chapter 3 contains Jehovah's instructions to Hosea to

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:45.250
take back his unfaithful wife. This symbolizes Jehovah's willingness to show mercy to the Israelites

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:53.250
if they repent of their idolatry in Obey Jehovah. Hosea foretells that Israel will look

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:01.250
for Jehovah and for David their king. A prophecy ultimately fulfilled with Jesus as heavenly

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:10.680
king. Did you know the Northern 10 tribe Kingdom of Israel was at times called Ephraim

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:16.680
or Samaria. Ephraim was the dominant tribe of the Kingdom and Samaria was the Kingdom's

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:27.759
capital city. Chapters 4-13 contain judgments against unfaithful Ephraim. These were fulfilled

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:36.759
when Assyria overthrew the nation and its capital city Samaria. Chapter 14 contains a heartwarming

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:46.159
invitation to Israel to return to Jehovah who reassures the people of his mercy. As you study

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:54.159
the book of Hosea, note how Jehovah requires unhypercritical worship is merciful toward repentant

00:02:54.159 --> 00:03:01.159
wrongdoers and is loyal to his promise of providing a heavenly king from the line of David.
