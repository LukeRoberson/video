00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:14.310
We can watch a tiny seed transform into a beautiful plant.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:21.309
But what part do timing and surrounding conditions play in plant growth?

00:00:21.309 --> 00:00:29.739
During the cold season, seeds and bulbs remain dormant.

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:39.810
Later, as temperatures rise and days lengthen, they bloom.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:49.079
Some desert plants practically shut down during long dry periods.

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.079
It finally rains.

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.079
It's their time to grow and flower.

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:08.799
Some flower plants need lots of light.

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:13.799
Throughout the day, they turn to follow the sun.

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.799
After their flowers open, they stop moving and face east all day.

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:32.489
Jehovah made plants to respond to their environment at the right time.

00:01:32.489 --> 00:01:37.489
We respond to evidence that these are the last days.

00:01:37.489 --> 00:01:41.489
And we focus on the source of spiritual light.

00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:47.969
Jesus said,

00:01:47.969 --> 00:02:03.140
Likewise also you, when you see all these things, know that he is near at the doors.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:15.569
See creatures, do they benefit by acting at the right time?

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.569
These are young salmon.

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.819
They start life in freshwater.

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:30.159
Most species migrate down river to the ocean to feed and grow.

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:38.169
They time the trip around the currents and available food.

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:44.169
Later, as adults, they're ready to head back and start the next generation.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:53.060
They wait until river conditions are suitable to migrate up river.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.060
Then, they go.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:13.969
Dolphins, too, perform different activities at different times.

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:16.969
There's time to play.

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:19.969
To see what's for dinner.

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:22.969
And to make friends.

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:27.969
But there are times when a dolphin knows to act with urgency.

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:33.969
When threatened, the dolphin pot closes ranks to protect everyone.

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:36.969
Especially the young.

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:45.539
We stay close to one another for safety in a spiritually dangerous world.

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:52.539
And no matter how busy we are, we make time to be taught by Jehovah.

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:57.539
Look, now is the especially acceptable time.

00:03:57.539 --> 00:04:01.539
Look, now is the day of salvation.

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:19.399
Jehovah gave birds inherent abilities that enable them to survive in challenging environments.

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:24.699
Consider emperor penguins.

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:28.699
How do these birds deal with their unique challenges?

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:32.699
And what can we learn from their sense of timing?

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:42.699
For many birds, the end of the Antarctic summer marks the start of a migration north to milder conditions.

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.699
But emperor penguins instinctively do the opposite.

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:53.699
They head south, moving deeper into the cold to breed.

00:04:53.699 --> 00:05:01.699
Each female then lays a single egg, which is soon entrusted to the male for safekeeping.

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:06.269
These sights are very inhospitable.

00:05:06.269 --> 00:05:09.269
But the emperors are prepared.

00:05:09.269 --> 00:05:13.269
Jehovah has given them instinctive wisdom.

00:05:13.269 --> 00:05:21.269
Before migrating south, these males had feasted and built up their fat reserves.

00:05:21.269 --> 00:05:32.269
Because for two long months, the coldest and darkest of the year, they won't eat and will lose half their body weight while they incubate the eggs.

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:47.139
During this time, the females have trekked about 50 miles to the sea, and are now ready to return with food.

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:51.139
Just in time for when the chicks hatch.

00:05:51.139 --> 00:06:01.120
Preparing ahead for the difficult times helps these penguins to survive, along with a young.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:09.120
Now is the time for us to learn from the emperor penguin, and build up our spiritual reserves.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:16.139
Before this world's dark days become even darker.

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:27.889
Even the stalk in the sky knows its seasons.

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:33.889
Bees work hard, and they have a lot to do.

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:39.889
How do bees and other insects get their work done on time?

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:42.889
Honeybees are adaptable.

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:52.889
They organize their foraging to save time and energy, and to visit flowers when they have plenty of nectar and pollen.

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:56.889
The bees' timing works out for all involved.

00:06:56.889 --> 00:07:02.970
Plants get pollinated, and the bees make honey.

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:15.949
This is the sound of cicadas in eastern North America.

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:20.949
This variety develops underground for 17 years.

00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:30.300
Right on time, they emerge by the billions.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:38.300
They'll have just a few weeks to shed their skin and finish the most important work of their life.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.300
To find a mate, and lay their eggs.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:57.910
Whether with an adaptable routine like the honeybee, or a fixed one like the cicada, insects instinctively accomplish their work on time.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:05.379
We have an important work to do, and a limited time to do it.

00:08:05.379 --> 00:08:13.379
With a regular schedule, and by adapting it as needed, we can make wise use of our time.

00:08:14.379 --> 00:08:18.379
Therefore, the way I'm running is not aimlessly.

00:08:18.379 --> 00:08:29.759
The way I am aiming my blows is so as not to be striking the air.

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:34.759
Land mammals can stay active for long periods.

00:08:34.759 --> 00:08:39.759
From the large to the not so large.

00:08:39.759 --> 00:08:45.759
But all of them need some time each day to sleep.

00:08:45.759 --> 00:08:50.759
African elephants get about two hours of sleep per day.

00:08:50.759 --> 00:08:54.759
Horses sleep for close to three hours.

00:08:54.759 --> 00:08:58.759
A wild sloth might doze for up to 14.

00:08:58.759 --> 00:09:04.759
And a little brown bat can snooze for nearly 19.

00:09:04.759 --> 00:09:09.139
But how does sleep help them?

00:09:09.139 --> 00:09:14.139
Sleep allows the body to recuperate from the day's activities.

00:09:14.139 --> 00:09:22.139
And some scientists believe that sleep allows their brains to reset and remove toxins.

00:09:22.139 --> 00:09:26.139
As if giving the brain a good scrub.

00:09:26.139 --> 00:09:33.639
It may also help to move the day's memories into long-term storage.

00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:36.639
We humans need sleep too.

00:09:36.639 --> 00:09:39.639
The younger we are, the more we need.

00:09:39.639 --> 00:09:50.809
We are not made to work constantly without sufficient rest and balanced recreation.

00:09:50.809 --> 00:10:00.309
And unlike animals, we need time to refresh our faith and confidence in Jehovah.

00:10:00.309 --> 00:10:09.129
Our friendship with him must always be the most important thing in our life.

00:10:09.129 --> 00:10:23.019
Make sure of the more important things so that you may be flawless up to the day of Christ.
