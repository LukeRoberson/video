00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:11.599
I was serving at the Austria branch from about mid-70s to 1990.

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:17.600
We had a small department that was assigned to help certain countries east and Europe.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.600
And that included visiting the brothers on the ban, bringing them spiritual food,

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.600
having secret meetings with them, and also the strengths of the local organization

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.600
that was exposed to persecution and ban.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:38.600
We would print books on Bible paper and miniature size.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.600
This way more books or literature could be taken to these countries.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:50.600
The couriers, they transported literature to these countries in their own private cars.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.600
This way hundreds of books could be transported.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.679
At the border, if a courier would be found transporting literature,

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:03.679
they would interrogate the driver.

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:06.680
But these brothers were trained.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.680
They knew what to say to protect the work and not give away any secrets.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:19.680
Usually, after a day or two days, the officials would let them go back home to the home country.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.680
But not with their car. They had to have public transportation.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.680
Because the cars would be confiscated.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.680
But the brothers had a spiritual sacrifice. They were willing to waste that.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:40.680
But the majority got through, and actually every year thousands of miniature books were transported secretly to eastern Europe.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:49.680
So it was not just a matter of us being so clever in hiding things, getting it to the brothers.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.680
But we were always fully convinced and had evidence that it was Jehovah's Holy Spirit that helped us.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:09.680
Also, we transported stencils for local production, so that in their countries they could reproduce the same material with mimeographing machines.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:16.680
In most cases, the mimeographing machines were transported secretly by the couriers.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.680
The other method was to build it within the country.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.680
I remember there was a brother that was a very skilled engineer.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.680
And under his direction, they decided to build it themselves.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.680
So they were self-made, offset printing presses.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.680
The brothers had a number of underground printers that they had dug out under their own homes.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.680
In many cases, the brothers had to do what they did during the night.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:55.680
Because in communist countries, they had to go during the day to a factory or whatever else and do some secular work.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:10.680
But it testifies to the great spirit of sacrifice that the brothers showed to forfeit so much of their private life as a family to do at night the printing of the spiritual faulty.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.680
Some had only a few hours of sleep.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:21.680
But they loved Jehovah and the brothers so much that they did it.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.120
There was no kingdom hall.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:32.120
The brothers had secret meetings in private homes and they would not all come at the same time.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:40.120
Because if the neighbors would see certain persons all the time going to a specific house, there could be suspicions.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.120
And every week, they had the meetings in a different home of the brothers.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:53.120
And this helped to protect the work so that it could be kept secret.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.120
Singing was very important for the brothers.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.120
And they didn't have to have a song in hand.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.120
They knew the texts of the song by heart.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.120
And immediately, saying a number, they could sing the song.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.120
That affected the heart, the emotions of the brothers.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.120
So they were strengthened in their determination to be faithful.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.120
A lot of pressure was on the brothers in Romania.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:26.120
The Communist Party, they tried to so distrust among the brothers,

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:33.120
meeting with them separately and telling some brothers one thing, telling other brothers something else.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.120
Sometimes it has happened that an official posed as an interested person

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:46.120
and was clever enough to disguise that and pretend to make progress in the truth.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:53.120
Not only to the point of getting baptized, but even to the point of becoming an elder.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:02.120
But he was in reality an agent of the secret police, with the aim to find out everything about the organization.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:12.120
So it did lead in one case that brothers started to distrust someone that was actually appointed by headquarters.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:19.120
And these brothers then separated from the organization that Jehovah used.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:25.120
And some of them were separated for not just a few years, but for decades.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:31.120
And they were a large number, up to 5,000 publishers.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:39.120
They continued to meet together. They were preaching and using material that they had left over from earlier years.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:48.120
But they hardly got any new material to study because they were not in touch with the organization that was used for headquarters.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:55.120
Attempts to bring the brothers back into the organization were made from time to time.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:02.120
But it seemed that the brothers from the separated organization did not have sufficient trust.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:13.120
But when we presented to the leader of the separated group that one from the governing body would come,

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:21.120
he was happy about that and he had enough trust in that case to agree that we should have a meeting

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:26.120
and seriously talk about reunification.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:34.120
And so from the separated group, there were Brother Albu, who was the leader, and four of his main elders.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:42.120
And from our side, there was Brother Jeris, our translator, and I was part of that group.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:48.120
Also, there were several from the country committee of Romania.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:57.529
I remember the first night there was a lot of accusations about what the others had done and not done,

00:06:57.529 --> 00:07:02.529
which did not create the best spirit. And we mainly listened.

00:07:02.529 --> 00:07:07.839
But everybody agreed to meet another night.

00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:12.839
And the second night, obviously, Jehovah wanted the brothers to unite again.

00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:21.839
And the whole spirit was different and the brothers talked the matters over and clarified some misunderstandings.

00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:27.839
And at the end of the second evening, I remember the leader of the separate group, Brother Albu said,

00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:36.980
let's do it because if we don't do it now, we may never have another opportunity again.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:41.709
And so the decision was made.

00:07:41.709 --> 00:07:51.589
It doesn't happen every day. The five thousand brothers come back to the organization.

00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:58.589
From then on, all the practical things were put in place to accomplish this reunification.

00:07:58.589 --> 00:08:02.589
They were asked to merge with our congregations.

00:08:02.589 --> 00:08:10.589
And it also took a lot of humility on their part, but they were willing to do it.

00:08:10.589 --> 00:08:18.589
So they were really brothers in their heart and loved the truth.

00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:28.970
And so the reunification was accomplished. And it was a wonderful victory for Jehovah and against Satan.

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:38.970
Reflecting on the experience with the brothers in Romania, we can see that could always be a misunderstanding among humans.

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:47.970
And there could always be even legitimate complaints about misconduct of some responsible brothers.

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:54.970
But the important thing is never to lose trust that this is Jehovah's organization.

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:59.970
That's where Jehovah's blessing is. Jehovah sees it all.

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:04.970
Jehovah uses his Holy Spirit to keep the organization together.

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:08.970
And what he wants to have accomplished will happen.

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:16.970
And if we work with the Holy Spirit, then Jehovah will bless our efforts and it will be successful to his praise.
