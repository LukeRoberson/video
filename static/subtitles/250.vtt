00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.690
That was terrible. I could have answered that better.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.689
No, you did great, really.

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:14.689
I've always been hard on myself.

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:16.690
Really, he's printing our faith.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:26.460
Then have we, um, no, that's all.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.870
Sometimes, it made me so anxious

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:39.189
that even the normal stuff I do felt impossible.

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:54.579
So what do you think brings this out?

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.600
I don't know, maybe, maybe lately,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.600
it's because I'm thinking about escape.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.599
If I can reach that goal, it'll be fine.

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:09.359
Let me see.

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:12.359
How about we read a scripture that might help?

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:18.370
They didn't discourage me from escape,

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:24.420
but they suggested I try to manage the anxiety first.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.950
I was on it.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:41.420
If I focused on my goal and took care of myself,

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:51.099
I'd get there.

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:55.099
Maybe it was a little too much focus.

00:01:55.099 --> 00:02:07.340
Thank you, brothers.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:19.210
So, I'm the right.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.000
Escape would be a lot for me right now.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
But you get there.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.110
I tried everything to fix this.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.110
What's wrong with me?

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.110
Nothing.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.469
Some things just take time.

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:43.469
Hey, I have Lily's study tomorrow morning.

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:51.009
I could use your help.

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:54.009
I want to get baptized.

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:58.009
But I don't know.

00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:03.300
You all do so much.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.300
I don't think I could ever really be.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:15.430
I think I understand.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.430
Can I show you something?

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.430
Micah 68.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:26.259
What do you read that?

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:29.259
He has told you, oh man, what is good?

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:31.259
And what is Jehovah requiring of you?

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:35.259
Only to exercise justice, to cherish loyalty,

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:38.259
and to walk in modesty with your God.

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:42.259
That last part, walk in modesty.

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:47.259
That's about knowing our limitations.

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:52.259
So, is Jehovah happy with what you can do?

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:55.259
Or does he want what you can to do?

00:03:55.259 --> 00:04:01.020
He only expects what I can do.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.020
Then, why should we expect more?

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.020
Turns out, I gave Lily the same advice that brothers gave me.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.020
It was my turn to apply it.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.300
I had to be honest with myself.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:21.300
My limitation was my own high expectations.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.300
I've been doing it so long that there was no quick fix.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.899
It didn't mean giving up on my goals though.

00:04:29.899 --> 00:04:40.459
I just tried to focus more on what I could do in the present.

00:04:40.459 --> 00:04:43.459
Like having more empathy for people who feel like I do.

00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:48.949
And showing them how much Jehovah values them.

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:58.430
We could tell by the student how we...

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.060
How we overcame a challenge.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.060
True this, I can actually do a lot for Jehovah.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.920
With the reasonable expectations.
