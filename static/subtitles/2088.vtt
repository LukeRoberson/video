00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.639
Jehovah's Witnesses are known for publishing in hundreds of languages,

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:12.640
with a website recognized as the most widely translated in the world.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:18.640
But have you ever wondered how we're able to release our literature in print and online

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.640
and so many languages at once?

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.640
The answer involves a cutting-edge publishing system that our brothers developed

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.640
more than 40 years ago, a breakthrough in publishing called Maps.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.640
But just what is Maps?

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.640
Let's find out and see how this technology has helped to unite Jehovah's people

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.640
and has opened the way for us to give the greatest witness in history.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:01:03.820
God's people have long understood the need to share the truth in as many languages as possible.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:10.819
Revelation chapter 14 verse 6 prophesied that the good news would be preached to every nation

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:14.819
and tribe and tongue and people.

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:17.819
So as far back as the late 1800s,

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:22.819
the early Bible students translated our literature into languages other than English

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:26.819
so that people could learn the truth in their mother tongue.

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:34.819
But for decades, publishing the good news in many languages was a labor-intensive process.

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:39.819
Imagine yourself working at a Bethel printer decades ago.

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:42.819
It's hot and loud.

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:45.819
Printing required the use of a line of type machine,

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:54.819
which turned molten lead into small metal slabs of type called slugs one line at a time.

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:02.819
Workers had to meticulously compose pages by arranging the slugs into large metal frames

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:05.819
that were used to make special embossed maps.

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:11.819
Then more hot metal was used to cast printing plates from the mats.

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:18.819
And for long press runs, the plates then had to be electroplated with nickel to harden them.

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.819
Finally, after removing any irregularities,

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.819
the plates were ready to be mounted on a large rotary printing press.

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.819
Publishing the same material in another language

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.819
meant repeating these pre-press steps from beginning to end.

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:41.819
It took months for a single magazine to be translated from English,

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.819
typeset, and printed.

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.819
For books, it could take years.

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:54.060
The days of hot metal were quickly ending.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:01.060
The printing industry began adopting the use of photo-type setting and offset presses.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:09.060
It was time to modernize operations at Bethel and make the transition to computers.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.060
But the brothers faced a unique challenge.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:19.060
At this point, we were already printing literature in 167 languages.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.060
So we needed a solution that could handle all those languages and more,

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.060
and not one of the commercially available systems could do that.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:40.020
So in 1979, a group of brothers and sisters were called to wash tower farms in Wal-Kill, New York.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:47.020
To develop a multi-language electronic photo-type setting system, or maps.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.020
So we got to work on building maps.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.020
Some brothers and sisters concentrated on the hardware, the actual circuitry,

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.020
other brothers concentrated on the screen itself and building that,

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.020
and then others of us concentrated on the software, the operating system you might say.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.020
The maps team designed and built almost everything.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:15.020
Computers, keyboards, screens, and software they had to.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.019
Personal computers with the power needed still weren't available,

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.019
and wouldn't be for another few years.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:27.019
Another massive part of the project involved creating the fonts.

00:04:27.019 --> 00:04:32.019
The individual letters used to make up the pages of text.

00:04:32.019 --> 00:04:38.019
Commercial fonts weren't available or were too expensive for many of the languages needed.

00:04:39.019 --> 00:04:47.019
So brothers and sisters had to draw each character by hand and scan them into the computer.

00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:53.810
For some languages, this meant drawing thousands of characters.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.810
The software then had to be programmed with all the rules for spacing and hyphenation

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.810
so that words and characters could be displayed correctly.

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:12.810
Just three years after the project began, the first MEPS unit was completed in 1982.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:20.810
With MEPS, an operator could enter text at a computer workstation in any supported language.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:26.810
After this, the workstation could be used to format the text and compose pages.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:36.810
This approach allowed the brothers to use a single-page layout to produce the same publication for all languages.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:45.810
The final pages were then rendered on photographic paper, transferred to film, and used to make printing plates.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.810
MEPS didn't do the translation itself.

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.810
That was, and still is, a job for human translators.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.810
But it allowed all the pre-press work to be completed in a fraction of the time.

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:05.810
And MEPS achieved something even more important than increased speed and efficiency.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.810
It addressed a global spiritual need.

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.810
Even before the MEPS project began, the governing body realized

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:21.810
that if Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide could somehow study the same material each week at meetings,

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.810
it would unite them as never before.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:30.810
And it was clear that with MEPS, along with faster presses and other adjustments in production,

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.810
this could finally become a reality.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:07:03.810
The April 1, 1984 issue of the Watch Tower became the first to be published in multiple languages simultaneously.

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:10.810
In just the next year, the number of simultaneous languages grew to 23.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:20.810
And by 2021, the study edition of the Watch Tower was being published simultaneously in more than 390 languages.

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:30.810
Almost all of Jehovah's Witnesses are now able to study the same spiritual food at our meetings at the same time.

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:33.810
Truly a modern day miracle.

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:37.810
Today, MEPS does a lot more than typesetting.

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:41.810
It's grown to become a full set of publishing tools.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:47.810
MEPS programming paved the way for Watch Tower Library on CD-ROM

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:51.810
and contributed to the development of the JW Library app.

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:59.810
In fact, the MEPS acronym now stands for Multi-Language Electronic Publishing System

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:04.810
because it drives our publishing both imprint and online.

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:10.810
In the end, the story of MEPS is more than a story of technology.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:12.810
It's one of love.

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:21.810
Love moved the governing body to seek better ways to provide spiritual food to people of every tribe and tongue.

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:34.809
As a result of that love, and with Jehovah's Holy Spirit, we now enjoy unprecedented unity and the ability to preach the good news on a scale never before possible.
