00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:08.880
James 4.7, oppose the devil and he will flee from you is indeed a powerful encouragement.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.400
By these reassuring words, Jehovah reminds us of the potential we have.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.679
Why can we say so?

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:22.039
Because Jehovah would never expect us to do something that is beyond our abilities.

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.320
And even if we ourselves in certain situations might feel we are not having the strength

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.320
anymore.

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:33.520
We know Jehovah will empower us.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.759
Now, when was it the last time that you opposed the devil?

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:46.719
We all understand the general concept of James 4.7 and yet it might be a challenge to get

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:51.119
specific when it comes to applying it on a personal level.

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:55.679
We are not having conversations directly with the devil as Jesus did when he was tempted

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:57.520
three times.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.679
And we know that this devil might not cause all of our problems.

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:11.000
But we also know that he is sure to use them for his purpose.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.760
Therefore, let us try to analyze two examples, two areas where we oppose the devil and

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.079
experience that he flee from us.

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:25.640
First of all, let's talk about our health.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.079
Now health problems are something most of us have to deal with in one way or another.

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.719
Sadly, some of us have even to deal with serious issues or disabilities.

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:41.439
So now, what does this have to do with opposing the devil?

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:47.719
One of the subtle attacks of the devil is trying to use our proper concern for our health

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:52.120
in order to shift our focus away from spiritual things.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.879
He wants to make use of us being overly distracted.

00:01:56.879 --> 00:02:04.359
He would like us becoming consumed with matters of health to the extent that they take first

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:06.400
place in our life.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:13.560
Or he would like us to go to extremes in striving and to maintain our health.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.840
But he has no success.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:24.280
One of the reasons we find in Luke 12, I'd like to invite you to open with me, Luke 12,

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.639
and we would like to read verse 25.

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:30.800
Here Jesus asked a good question.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:40.599
He says, who of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his lifespan?

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:48.680
So why we take good care of our health in line with Jesus' words found in Luke 5 verse 31,

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:55.280
we are not becoming undulyed anxious over things we cannot control.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.520
At the convention I talked to one of the attendants, a brother in his 30s.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.840
At first, it was just a normal small talk.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.599
Later in the conversation, he revealed to me that he was actually supposed to be at

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.759
the hospital.

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:17.080
The doctors had told him that he would not survive the next five months.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.879
Would he now be fully absorbed in finding some treatment and forgetting all his spiritual

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:23.879
routine?

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:30.400
No, our brother persisted in getting some medicine to be able to attend the convention.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.960
He wanted to serve as attendant.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.360
He wanted to care for others.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:42.719
And so strengthened by the program, he was ready to go back to the hospital the next day.

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:46.039
We are not sacrificing our spirituality.

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:48.800
We maintain our spiritual balance.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.360
And despite our challenges, we are caring for others.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:59.080
In this way, we oppose the devil and some of us on a daily basis.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.639
Now let's look at the second example.

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:06.599
Another area where we successfully oppose the devil is our attitude.

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:11.520
We all know the attitude makes a big difference in life.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:18.720
For example, a positive or a negative attitude can influence how we deal with certain situations

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.480
and how other people react to us.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:29.079
The same is true with a complaining or a grateful attitude.

00:04:29.079 --> 00:04:35.279
If we had a bad attitude, nothing would seem right, even when from an objective point

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:39.480
of view, life is just good.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:47.759
It would be like putting a dirty towel on a nice piece of decoration in our room.

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:52.319
So what does this have to do with opposing the devil?

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:55.560
A negative attitude can be used by Satan.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:02.000
It can accumulate in our heart and overpower our ability to decide wisely.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.319
We might lose our joy in Jehovah's service.

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:07.879
It also can weaken our resolve to resist wrongdoing.

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:14.240
So do we see how the devil would be able to benefit from it?

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.879
Of course, as Christ followers, we avoid negative or a complaining attitude, although this

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:22.279
is not always easy.

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:30.199
But maybe we feel down because we are sometimes not content with what we are able to accomplish.

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:35.279
Are we, for example, disappointed at times that we did not reach a goal that we've set

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:37.519
for ourselves?

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:44.160
Maybe we were encouraged to spend more time in the ministry and then things just did not

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.639
turn out the way we planned it.

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:53.040
And then we are sitting in the congregation meeting, we are listening to nice experiences

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.839
of others.

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:56.839
How do we feel?

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:58.839
Are we discouraged?

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:00.639
That can be dangerous.

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:03.720
Let's turn to Proverbs 24 together.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:11.560
Let's read together 20 Proverbs, chapter 24, the verse 10, because here this danger that

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.279
can be utilized by Satan is identified.

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:22.639
Here we read Proverbs 24, verse 10, if you become discouraged in the day of distress,

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:25.240
that's what we were talking.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.850
Your strength will be meager.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:37.730
Prolonged negative feelings can rob us of our strength, making us feel weak and vulnerable.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.730
Satan knows this well.

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:46.810
It is difficult enough if our heart is plagued with such feelings of unworthiness or worthlessness.

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:53.250
However, when Satan attempts to exploit such feelings, it makes such a situation even

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.129
more burdensome.

00:06:56.129 --> 00:07:04.449
So as we maintain a balanced view of ourselves, or as the Apostle Paul calls it in Romans 12,

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:11.649
verse 3, as we maintain a sound mind, we oppose the devil.

00:07:11.649 --> 00:07:21.250
As we remind ourselves that Jehovah just expects 100%, our personal 100%, today is 100%.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:27.930
Not the 100% of somebody else, not the 100% of what we were able to do years ago, as we

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:35.490
keep this balanced view of ourselves, we are not doing the devil's work.

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:40.889
So when was it the last time that you opposed the devil?

00:07:40.889 --> 00:07:44.930
We just discussed two subtle forms of his attack.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:50.649
Probably we are all opposing the devil on a daily basis.

00:07:50.649 --> 00:07:58.089
We do not allow ourselves to be unduly anxious in health matters, and we work hard in maintaining

00:07:58.089 --> 00:08:00.089
a good attitude.

00:08:00.089 --> 00:08:08.980
In fact, that we are here together today is proved that we all oppose the devil and that

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:12.100
we experience that he flees from us.
