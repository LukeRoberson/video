00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:08.539
One of the outstanding highlights of the 2014 service here in the central Europe branch

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:14.140
and by the way that's Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Lichtenstein and Luxembourg.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:21.859
So one of the highlights was certainly the international convention held in July in Frankfurt.

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:28.859
This convention hosted about 35,000 brothers and sisters, included 3,000 delegates from

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.460
all over the world, perhaps even some of you.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:40.140
In total more than 230,000 attendees enjoyed the program at various locations in the whole

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:50.500
branch territory at the same weekend, and almost 1,500 got peptized at that special weekend.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.780
Local brothers as well as many delegates had wonderful experiences.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.500
There is, for example, the Indian cap driver in Frankfurt, yes, in Frankfurt.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.500
He took a group of delegates from Australia and from Slovakia and his taxi and they got into

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:15.019
a friendly conversation. And as he recognized their batches, they had the opportunity to

00:01:15.019 --> 00:01:22.299
give a brief witness and they had the chance to explain how the convention was all about

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:27.180
and how the Bible had united people of all backgrounds to come together in peace.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:36.379
As they reached their destination, the taxi driver refused to accept any money of them.

00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:42.140
He insisted not to charge them and said, this morning I took some of your people to the convention

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:49.659
and I didn't charge them and I don't want to charge you. You people are doing a holy work

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:56.379
and for this reason I won't charge you. At least they could give him something far more

00:01:56.379 --> 00:02:01.739
worthy than money they gave him a tract. And Jehovah knows what effect this will have on him.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.219
Another very encouraging but somewhat bizarre situation to place in a hotel in Frankfurt.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:16.620
A couple who visited as delegates from the US, rehearsed their German field service presentation

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.900
in the lobby of the hotel just before going out to preach with the local brothers.

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:29.580
Interestingly, they attracted the attention of the hotel manager who asked what they were doing.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.500
So they explained him what they are doing. Surprisingly, the manager offered to serve himself

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.860
as a sort of crash test dummy so that they could try their presentation on him.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.699
The couple accepted the offer and tried their German field service presentation on the manager.

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:55.979
To the joy of our couple, he took time to coach them still with some fine tuning on their

00:02:55.979 --> 00:03:02.860
German grammar and pronunciation. And as the couple thought everything was said and done,

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:09.900
the manager asked, don't you normally offer some magazines? And the couple said yes.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.979
And then the manager said, and why don't you offer them to me? I would love to take them.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.060
You can imagine how surprised the couple wasn't, of course, the manager got his magazines.

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:26.939
As you can see, that convention had really a great impact, not only on the brotherhood,

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:32.620
but as well on the outsiders. Besides that convention highlight, there is another very

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:39.020
encouraging development in our branch territory. It's the continuous increase of regular pioneers

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:47.340
in the last years. Just a few facts. In 2004, we had about 7,400 regular pioneers.

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:58.139
And this number increased to 11,500 until now. Today, it already 870 regular,

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:05.419
by new regular pioneers have been appointed for the 2015 service year only in Germany.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:14.219
And 1554 in our whole branch territory. Among them, there are many couples. And it is very

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:20.939
encouraging to see how more and more publishers in our quite wealthy country set the kingdom on

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:28.220
first place in their lives. We also see a lot of growth in the foreign language territory.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:35.579
Currently, of the about 210,000 publishers in our branch territory, almost 50,000

00:04:35.579 --> 00:04:46.379
work in the foreign language field. During the 2014 service year, 1717 foreign

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:55.100
language congregations were formed, plus 63 groups, plus 54 pregroups. And an amazing number

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:04.300
of 1216 got baptized at foreign language assemblies and conventions in the last service year

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:11.980
in language fields such as Romanian, Bulgarian, Persian, Tigrinia, Turkish, Chinese, and many others.

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:19.259
We are convinced that these developments are another evidence that God's kingdom rules.

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:31.740
And this motivates us all to do our very best to be fellow workers of Jehovah.
