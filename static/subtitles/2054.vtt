If Mom and Dad were alive, they would be very proud of you.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.300
You know what I'm thinking? You could have more.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.300
I'm talking about real security for you and the family.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.300
A government capenture contract.

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:30.600
You 93.6.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.600
I had an update to our report from yesterday. Malaysia Groups are threatening to take over the capital.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.600
Violence has been escalating in the area.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.600
As you are aware, the branch has recommended that we meet and discuss the possibility of several unrest in our area.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.600
There will always be rumors surrounding the elections.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.600
The safety of the congregation is the concern.

00:00:58.159 --> 00:00:59.159
There's no need to worry.

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:03.409
These are just threats, rumors.

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.689
There's nothing to it. We received a direction from the branch.

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:12.689
Those brothers are so far away though.

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.689
I keep wondering if they have been overly cautious.

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:20.189
Remember, Amani.

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.189
This strength will be...

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:36.700
Are you still trusting these people to guide your life?

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.700
Father Jehovah, please help me.
