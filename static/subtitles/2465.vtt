00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.570
Mm-hmm.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.949
Oh.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.629
Hey, there.

00:00:21.629 --> 00:00:24.510
Making bread sure is tiring.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.390
This reminds me of that time Abigail delivered all

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.129
of that food to a friend.

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:30.969
Do you know why she did that?

00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:33.869
It wasn't just for hospitality.

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:34.829
Come on.

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.070
Let's take a look.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.130
Abigail was on a mission.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.229
She was out to meet David.

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:46.670
You see, earlier, David did a very good thing.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.869
He protected a flock of sheep, even though they weren't his.

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:55.070
Those sheep belonged to Abigail's husband, Navel.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.670
He was a rude and senseless man.

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:02.869
In exchange for protecting Navel's sheep,

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.599
David asked for some food to eat, but Navel hated to share.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.000
He screamed mean things about David.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.000
David then got angry and wanted to kill Navel.

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:22.400
When Abigail found out, she knew this would be bad.

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:25.599
So Abigail acted fast.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.200
She gathered all the bread and wine she could find.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.400
And quickly brought it over to David and his men.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.159
She approached them with kindness and respect.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.959
Abigail reminded David of all the good Jehovah promised him.

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:47.760
He was going to do great things for Jehovah.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.760
But if he killed Navel and anger,

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:55.760
he'd ruin his close relationship with Jehovah, his best friend.

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:58.959
David listened to Abigail.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.389
Jehovah's friends help each other avoid bad and do good.

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:12.990
But what happened to Navel, David and Abigail after that?

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.590
Read Abigail's story and imagine you were there.

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:20.389
Make time every day to learn from Jehovah's.

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:24.189
Gotta go.

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:27.189
What do you think?

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:31.389
What did Abigail do to remain Jehovah's friend?

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.990
When have you seen a friend about to do something bad?

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.189
What could you say to prevent your friend from doing something bad?
