00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.629
This is going to look great.

00:00:21.629 --> 00:00:25.629
Hey there, I'm working on something from Joseph's story.

00:00:25.629 --> 00:00:28.629
Do you remember what happened with his brothers?

00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:30.629
Oh, you're going to love this one.

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:32.630
It's about forgiveness.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:38.630
When Joseph was a boy, his father Jacob loved him very much.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.630
His older brothers were jealous.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.630
They wanted to be treated special like Joseph.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.630
They hated him so much.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:52.509
They threw him into a water pit.

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:55.509
And later, they sold him as a slave.

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:59.979
Can you imagine how Joseph felt?

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:07.980
He lost everything, everything except his best friend, Jehovah.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.980
Many years passed and there was a terrible famine.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.980
Joseph's brothers needed food.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.980
So they traveled to Egypt and guess who was in charge of all the food?

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.980
Joseph all grown up.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.980
After years of staying faithful to Jehovah,

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.980
Joseph continued faithful as a leader in Egypt.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.980
But his brothers didn't recognize him before he told him who he was.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.980
Joseph put them through many tests.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.980
He wanted to see if they were better people.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.980
And they were.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.980
His brothers were really sorry for what they had done.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.980
What did Joseph do?

00:01:48.980 --> 00:02:04.180
Joseph forgave them.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.180
Jehovah's friends forgave.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.180
But what did Joseph do next to them?

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.180
Read his story and imagine you were there.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.180
Make time every day to learn from Jehovah's friends.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.689
What do you think?

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:25.689
What did Joseph do to show he was Jehovah's friend?

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:29.689
When was it hard for you to forgive someone?

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:32.689
How do you feel when someone forgives you?
