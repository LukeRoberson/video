00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:07.820
Well, earthquakes have been, in the news quite a bit recently, but we're going to read

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:17.260
about an earthquake in Psalm 46, which describes one that has never happened in recorded history.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:28.519
Psalm 46, starting with verse 1, says, there, God is our refuge and strength, a help that

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:35.719
is readily found in times of distress. That is why we will not fear, though the earth undergoes

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:42.399
change, or some translations say, though the earth quakes, though the mountains topple into

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:49.399
the depths of the sea, though its waters roar and foam over, though the mountains rock on

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:55.740
account of its turbulence. Now, there's no evidence that this poetic description of

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:02.179
mountains toppling into the sea literally happened in ancient Israel. But clearly, the

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:09.180
world around the psalma seemed to be collapsing somehow. What catastrophic situation is being

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.640
referred to? Well, the watchtower has explained that this psalm seems to fit the time of King

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:23.620
Hezekiah, when Jerusalem was being threatened by Sinacra, the king of Assyria. Now, we know

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:31.500
those threats were not empty. Sinacra had conquered surrounding nations. He had also conquered

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.980
the fortified cities around Jerusalem that were protecting the city. He'd actually overrun

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:45.540
the villages right up to Nob, and Nob was within sight of Jerusalem one mile away. And as you

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:53.040
know, Assyria was famous for its cruelty. They found palace walls from Sinacra,

00:01:53.120 --> 00:02:02.480
times the shocking scenes of brutality toward conquered peoples. So we can understand why the psalm

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:10.560
has felt the world was collapsing. The description is so ominous and bleak. But suddenly, in verse four,

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:19.120
the tone of the psalm changes completely. There is a river, the streams of which make the city of

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:27.680
God rejoice. The holy Grand Tabernacle of the most high. God is in the city. It cannot be overthrown.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:36.479
God will come to its aid at the break of dawn. So the psalmist thoughts go from catastrophe and chaos

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:45.120
to peace and confidence. In verse four, speaks about a river in the city of God. There's no river

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:52.159
flowing in Jerusalem. So what is this referring to? Well, some suggest that it refers to Hezekiah's

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:58.479
tunnel that was built in order to bring water into the city. But the poetic structure of the psalm

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:06.479
actually parallels the river to the holy Tabernacle of Jehovah, the holy Tabernacle of the

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:12.879
most high, and the pure worship carried on there. And it's interesting that when Hezekiah

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:20.719
received the threats from Sinacra, the scriptures say at 2 Kings 19 that Hezekiah took the letters

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.360
from the Assyrians. He went into the temple. He spread them out before Jehovah and He prayed

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:35.039
fervently. And then Jehovah sent a reassuring message through Isaiah. I have heard your prayer to

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:41.919
me concerning Sinacra king of Assyria. He will not come into the city or shoot an arrow there or

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:49.919
bring a shield or siege rampart against it. Now the sons of Korah who recorded this psalm may have

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:57.520
seen Hezekiah going into the temple and then heard Jehovah's response through Isaiah. And this would

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:05.199
give them complete confidence in the outcome. And we all know what happened next. The huge Assyrian

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:12.639
army was vanquished overnight by an angel. And it could be that verse 5 alludes to this where it says

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:22.129
God will come to its aid at the break of dawn. But what does this psalm teach us? Well, the psalmist

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:27.889
example of focusing on pure worship and his word, which is likened to a river in this psalm,

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:34.209
shows that we can experience peace even when the world around us seems to be collapsing.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:44.129
The psalmist declared God is in the city. He was its ruler, not Sinacra. For decades, Judah had

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:51.410
been wayward and God was not in Jerusalem. But Hezekiah renovated the temple and restored pure

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:58.290
worship there. That pure worship was like a river of blessing that connected the people to Jehovah

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:06.610
and gave powerful evidence that God was in the city. Our pure worship book associates the river

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:12.689
of Psalm 46 with the river that flowed from Jehovah's sanctuary in Ezekiel's vision.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:19.170
And you might recall that that river became wider and deeper the further it flowed.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:25.649
And the pure worship book says about it, like the visionary river that Ezekiel saw,

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:32.769
the flow of pure truce has expanded rapidly. And today the flow of that river includes

00:05:32.769 --> 00:05:41.170
Bibles, Bible-based publications and videos in over a thousand languages. Ezekiel said that the river

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:48.769
got so deep that a person had to swim. And for the last five months, you students have felt

00:05:48.769 --> 00:05:58.689
like Ezekiel. Your course has immersed you and sometimes taken you underwater. And that was

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:04.689
from the flood of Bible knowledge you received through your study, your lectures, and also the

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:10.610
interaction with the students and also your instructors. And you may have felt like you were

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:18.370
even drowning sometimes. But like Hezekiah and those with them, you've also been in the confines

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:25.730
of a secure city where Jehovah's worship prevails. During these months, the world has been

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:31.810
dealing with the aftermath of the pandemic and wars and other disasters. But you were like the

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:38.689
psalmist. The earth could quake, the mountains could topple, but you enjoyed a special period of

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:46.420
peace because you were focused on that river. Now you're going back out into the trenches with

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:51.620
the rest of us, so to speak. Some of you will serve where there's economic toil,

00:06:52.740 --> 00:07:00.180
turmoil or violence or other disasters, or you may personally face health trials, even persecution.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:08.500
But the lesson of Gilead and the lesson of Psalm 46 can serve you well. When you stay focused on

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:16.259
the river, Jehovah's pure worship, you can remain confident and joyful regardless of what challenges

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:24.100
life brings. An ancient Greek writer said, no man ever steps in the same river twice,

00:07:24.899 --> 00:07:30.980
for it's not the same river and he's not the same man. And isn't it true that our lives are

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:38.899
constantly changing and new challenges suddenly crop up? But Jehovah's river of blessings just

00:07:38.899 --> 00:07:45.540
keeps flowing and is constantly renewed. It supplies life-giving water in all circumstances.

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:52.660
And this is so even when the figurative mountains of this world are toppling and the world is in chaos.

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:58.209
A sister in the Warzone in Eastern Ukraine wrote,

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:06.449
what we needed most was spiritual food. We were overwhelmed with joy when we received the JW

00:08:06.449 --> 00:08:13.970
boxes after the internet failed and spiritual food became available again. Despite many challenges

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:20.209
and difficulties, when we meet with fellow believers our problems are not the main subject of discussion.

00:08:21.329 --> 00:08:28.290
More often we share how Jehovah supports us, what has strengthened us and what we're thankful for.

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:36.529
We can sense her calmness. These friends are living examples of how focusing on the river

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:47.970
can preserve our peace even in times of disaster. Now returning to Psalm 46 we can paraphrase verses 8 and

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:55.970
9 which may have occurred when the angel destroyed the Issyrian army. It says, Jehovah has done

00:08:55.970 --> 00:09:03.090
astonishing things in the earth, bringing an end to wars, breaking the bow and the spear and

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:10.690
burning the military wagons. We can just imagine the astonishing scene going out into the Issyrian

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:16.129
camp and seeing the entire army devastated. Now what does that mean for us?

00:09:17.169 --> 00:09:22.690
Well we hate the war and violence that plagues this world and affects our dear brothers and we

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:30.690
long for it to end. But until then understanding that Jehovah is still in the city, still in control

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:38.049
with this people gives us complete confidence. No humans, no attack of an Issyrian-like government

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:46.450
can stop the flow of that river or shake the city. And the Psalmist concludes in verse 11,

00:09:47.409 --> 00:09:56.370
excuse me, with the reassuring echo of verse 1, Jehovah of armies is with us. The God of Jacob

00:09:56.370 --> 00:10:03.809
is a secure refuge for us. Well we don't know what your individual future holds after

00:10:03.809 --> 00:10:10.529
Gilead, what assignments you'll receive, but you can be confident that Jehovah is in the city,

00:10:10.529 --> 00:10:19.169
he's in control. And remember the lesson of Gilead, stay focused on the river. The river that makes

00:10:19.169 --> 00:10:30.529
the city of God rejoice, the river that will flow throughout eternity.
