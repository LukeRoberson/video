00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.780
Work constructed in the new Britain branch offices is well underway.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.779
A Theocratic project of this size is no small task.

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:13.779
It involves challenges.

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:16.780
What were some of those challenges?

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.780
How did those involved feel?

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.780
And what can we learn from that?

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.780
The branch facilities, an unusual entity,

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.780
a mixture of working, living, volunteers,

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.780
all on one property, that doesn't occur very often if ever.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.780
The common thread that people told us,

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.780
planning officers or councillors

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.780
where we made inquiries about a specific site was

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.780
you will never get a site anywhere in Britain

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.780
where you get that combination in one planning application.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.780
From a human viewpoint, it was just a complete conflict

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.509
of normal criteria.

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:59.509
We searched the country far and wide to try to find a council

00:00:59.509 --> 00:01:03.509
that was keen to follow the model that was needed for Bethel.

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:06.510
Amazingly, after almost three years

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.510
of searching for suitable properties,

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.510
having looked at over 300 sites,

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.510
we only came up with three that met the criteria.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.510
It was in 2011 that we looked at a site

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.510
in the Essex area, it was a disused hospital.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.510
That came to nothing because it was developed as residential

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.510
but it did eventually introduce us to the Chelmsford Council.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.510
And then the planning authority said,

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.510
well, we can't help you with that one.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.180
But have you thought about this one?

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.180
The brothers were looking everywhere they could see

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.180
but this was, in effect, an invisible site.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.180
It was a site that we hadn't even looked at

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.180
and wasn't even on our radar.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.180
So this is another area where we felt

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.180
that Jehovah's Hand was evident.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:58.180
The development on that site was already approved for 69,300 square metres

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.180
and a brief was 70,000 square metres.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.180
Having looked at so many other sites

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.180
where some doors would open

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.180
but others would remain shut,

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.180
to then come across a property, a site,

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.180
where all the doors opened.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.180
You knew this was different.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.180
You knew this was the right one.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.419
Another aspect of the work that was done to secure this site

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:28.419
was there was a lot of peripheral properties

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:30.419
which were strategic.

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:33.419
And we're useful to us in setting up site works

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:37.419
and in perhaps removing potential opposition

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:39.419
to our planning application.

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:42.419
For construction reasons, we needed staging,

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:46.419
we needed accommodation, we needed access points,

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:49.419
we needed buffer, those properties became available.

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.419
Just where we needed them, when we needed them.

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:55.419
It seemed that every single one of them had a reason

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:58.419
why they were contemplating selling up at that time.

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:01.419
So it wasn't just the branch property itself,

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:04.419
it was all the facilitating properties around

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:07.419
becoming available at the same time.

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:10.419
Again, it was remarkable, unprecedented.

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:12.419
None of them were actually on the market.

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:16.419
I see that too as another evidence of Jehovah's blessing.

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:24.419
A principle issue in the negotiation was the issue of contamination.

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:30.419
I was stumped with the absolute chaos and mess that it was.

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:35.419
So we negotiated a reduction in the purchase price.

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:41.419
The way the negotiations went, it was evidence to me of Jehovah's hand.

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:45.419
We had a specialist company do a full survey of the site

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:49.419
and they commented there is a barrier of clay across the whole site.

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:52.419
If it would have been chalk or limestone or sandstone

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:56.419
it wouldn't be able to build on that property.

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:02.669
There was a lot of obstacles to overcome.

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:04.669
And those were overcome little by little,

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:09.669
but we started to see Jehovah's hand as seemingly impossible.

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:12.669
Obstacles began to be removed.

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:15.669
Psalm 127 and verse 1 says,

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:18.670
unless Jehovah builds the house,

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.670
it is in vain that the builders work hard on it.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.670
Seeing Jehovah's direction first hand through the various phases

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.670
convinces us that the success of this project is not dependent

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.670
on favorable circumstances,

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.670
the skill of the workers,

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.670
or even the hard work of those involved.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:46.670
Building this new branch is only possible because of Jehovah's blessing.
