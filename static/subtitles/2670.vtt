WEBVTT

00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.259
We've been working on the project almost 12 months now.

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:09.259
I had a limited knowledge of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:11.259
Occasionally they knock on the door.

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.259
We only see one small part of you when you're coming around the streets

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:16.260
and you're knocking on doors.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I didn't even know they did these sort of projects.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
And then I've learned that they've been all over the world doing these.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
They're the same sort of things.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
I've never been on the site, this is well run as this one.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.260
The cleanliness of the actual site is impeccable.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.259
Seems a very, very well-organised site.

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:35.259
The planning of the whole thing.

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:37.259
There's the walkways, the routes in and out.

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:38.259
It's not been exemplary.

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:40.259
It's been an experience.

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:42.259
A good one I might add.

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:46.259
It's opened my way through a lot of different ways of working.

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:50.600
When I found out that most of the people on this site were volunteers,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.600
it was quite amazed.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.600
It was very clear that Watchtab was so much time into their people

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.600
in terms of bringing them on, putting the skills in,

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.599
making them capable of doing the job that they wanted to do.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:09.599
And that training and that time was just superb to see.

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:11.599
And this fella sitting next to me when I explained to him

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:14.599
with volunteers working at, he didn't believe me.

00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:16.599
Everyone we speak to, there's just no chance.

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:19.599
They wouldn't believe us to what we see and what we experience,

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:21.599
which has been good.

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:24.599
You've got ladies driving diggers and big dumpers

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:27.599
and it's not very often to say that.

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:30.599
Construction is still a male dominated environment,

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:32.599
but actually to come on site and see the number of women

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:35.599
that are actually operating plan and actually involved in, you know,

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:38.599
that the cold face construction is fantastic.

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:41.599
Because it proves that they're able to do as good a job

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:43.599
and walk you around this site.

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:46.599
I'll be honest with you, probably a bit of job in many instances.

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:51.599
It's amazing how the Obi-Wan is just really nice

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:55.599
and just seems so relaxed and just generally really, really nice people.

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:57.599
You always got hello, you always got goodbye,

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:00.599
you always were asked how you were doing.

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:04.599
When you go back home you feel different, you don't have that feeling

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:06.599
that stress on top of you.

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:10.599
We came here first time and it was almost to my mind like a film set.

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.599
Everyone seemed happy all the time and it didn't seem possible to happen.

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.599
Yeah, it's just continued for the last eight months, nine months I've been here.

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.599
And it's always happy and no one can fake that.

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.599
It's great to see people that are just really positive about everything

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.599
which in a negative, sometimes society, when you pick up the papers

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.599
and look at the news, it's just when you come here,

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.599
it's just with, it's a smile on your face.

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.599
It's just been a warm, a friendly experience,

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.599
other health and safety, the briefings, they're all still done.

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.599
How can you build so fast and so accurately with such quality though?

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.599
And that's what's blown our mind.

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:47.599
Most of the people on site haven't got the skills when they first came here

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.599
and they're doing work as good as some of our guys.

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.599
We've probably been employed six or seven years.

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.599
Communication has been fantastic.

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.599
It's a two-way conversation when problems are raised.

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.599
It's not always a fight over money.

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.599
It's just working with each other.

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.599
There's not an argument about everything.

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.599
If something's not right, you work together to get over the problem.

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.599
To see everyone here together is all striving for the same goal.

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:12.599
It's fantastic.

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.599
I think what's made it great for us working with a watchtower

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.599
is that everything they want to do, they want to do it right

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.599
and do everything with passion and energy.

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.599
And it's something that we like to do ourselves as well.

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.599
Build a GÃ¼rken in the city, build Wembley Stadium,

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:28.599
big projects, big status.

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.599
We've pretty much seen the cast of other professionals out there.

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.599
You would not know the difference.

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.599
I've been volunteer and non-profitable outside.

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.599
It's been actually incredible to see, really.

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:48.300
We've learned how to work together with other people on sites.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.300
We've learned how to work with people

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.300
that haven't been in the construction before.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.300
Just keeping it honest and straightforward

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.300
sort of solves a lot of problems.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.300
We wish it would be like that everywhere else,

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.300
because it's not unheard of really.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.300
We've learned more on this site than we've learned on any site.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.300
Probably about working with each other probably in 23 years.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.300
I've had enjoyable experience working with Joey Witnesses.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.300
If there was a chance to come up with another project

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.300
I'd definitely be more than willing to want to get involved.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.300
I wish all sites could be like this,

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.300
but life would be a lot easier.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.300
You need to get people to come to this site

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.300
and there would be a definite difference

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.300
in the way people perceive Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.300
It's certainly opened and bored in my mind

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.300
to what Jehovah Witnesses do.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.300
The most changed my opinion of your organisation most

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.300
is you do exactly what you preach,

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.300
and I mean exactly.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.300
You're friendly, you're forthright,

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.300
you're very truthful.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.300
I've never been on any other projects like this.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.300
Not at all.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.300
I just wish all construction sites would like that.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.300
It would be such a nice place to live and work.
