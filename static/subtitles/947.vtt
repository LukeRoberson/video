WEBVTT

00:00:24.239 --> 00:01:00.549
I don't remember when our routine service day became so well routine our zeal wasn't what it used to be and we were finally starting to notice

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:20.579
not everyone wants to listen we just didn't want to be the reason it didn't take much research to find great ideas and set a few simple goals

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:34.650
like working with those who encourage us with delta and army were always talking about how we can reach the heart

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:45.989
we got back to basics be friendly listen let the conversation progress naturally

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:55.739
try to share an appealing scriptural thought and keep trying

00:01:56.739 --> 00:02:18.120
our zeal can attract an honest person to the truth we'd made some good changes

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:27.560
but we weren't done I asked Yuri what she planned to talk about

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:34.560
that started the usual scramble and we got it the sample conversation

00:02:34.560 --> 00:03:07.310
that'll do but for that to work I had to remember the scripture we were both a little forgetful that morning

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:24.729
yeah we needed to prepare better we'd been relying on our experience and not enough on Jehovah

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:41.289
so first we prepared our hearts then we prepared our minds and found new ways to use our preaching tools

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:55.860
even a little preparation for initial calls and our return visits went a long way

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:36.269
they seemed nice I knew what Yuri was thinking

00:04:36.269 --> 00:04:52.629
I wanted to start a conversation but I didn't want to bother them either and when an opportunity came

00:04:52.629 --> 00:05:36.649
it froze then I was in a rush to give a witness it felt forced it helped to hear that with all been there

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:52.459
our past experiences were similar whenever we didn't put pressure on ourselves and just looked for something in common to talk about

00:05:52.459 --> 00:05:58.459
we could usually find a moment when we could say something about the Bible

00:05:58.459 --> 00:06:19.259
she was curious why we were dressed up turns out that she'd never talked to Jehovah's Witnesses before

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:31.680
Ami left a great question for her next visit return visit Mrs. Iwata

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:50.209
I told her I'd visit this morning I just didn't schedule the time I could at least stop by on the way back

00:06:50.209 --> 00:07:07.100
Mr. again if I didn't try something different I was just going to keep missing her

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:31.660
first I wanted her to know I hadn't forgotten her dear Mrs. Iwata I hope you're doing well

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:38.660
I promised to come by early next week by the way your flowers are so beautiful

00:07:38.660 --> 00:08:07.939
then I made a plan for my service day blowing through is just too important to leave to chance

00:08:07.939 --> 00:08:22.129
Mrs. Iwata was doing great we were already on lesson 10

00:08:22.129 --> 00:08:43.070
I really hope she come to a meeting soon we talked about Hebrews 10 24 and 25 and watched the video

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:54.519
did I miss something I guess I did I was too focused on our progress with the lessons

00:08:54.519 --> 00:09:10.179
instead of her progress and what she needed Mr. Iwata said going to meetings with dishonor the family

00:09:10.179 --> 00:09:19.179
he wanted her to quit the study she didn't want to quit but whenever she tried to talk about it

00:09:19.179 --> 00:09:27.179
they argued we showed her where to look for help and may time during our studies to talk about it more

00:09:27.179 --> 00:10:01.899
we all pray for Jehovah to bless her efforts we did our best to share the good news of peace

00:10:01.899 --> 00:10:11.870
and Jehovah did the rest
