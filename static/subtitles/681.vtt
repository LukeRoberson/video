00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:09.000
Many are aware that extensive travel arrangements are needed to assist special full-time servants

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.719
in a foreign field to attend one of the 2019 international conventions.

00:00:16.719 --> 00:00:21.559
What role does World Headquarters travel play in these arrangements?

00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:24.800
How are donated funds saved?

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.820
How has travel been arranged in the past?

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.619
The following report will not only give us a brief history of organisational travel,

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:41.979
but also to help us to see the behind-the-scenes activities that are necessary to help with

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:55.020
this year's international convention series.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.460
Travel has always been an integral part about organisation's spiritual activity.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.859
Jesus said, as recorded at Acts chapter 1 and verse 8,

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:14.019
you will be witnesses of me to the most distant part of the earth.

00:01:14.019 --> 00:01:24.260
In 1880, Brother Russell followed the example set by Jesus and embarked on a preaching tour.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.180
At first Brother Russell travelled throughout the northeastern United States and then internationally.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:38.980
In 1911, he travelled some 35,000 miles to lands, including China, India, Japan, and the Philippines.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:50.140
Then in 1914, more than 300 brothers were sent to what they referred to at the time as practically every city and district in the world, presenting Bible lectures.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:02:00.719
Well, Brother Brother Ferd and Brother Norr likewise travelled extensively, encouraging the household of faith.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.560
And then in 1943, with the inception of Gilead School,

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:14.439
where this involved inviting hundreds of students every year, training them, and then dispatching them to various missionary assignments around the world.

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:22.750
One day I received a phone call to go upstairs and the 10th floor in Sebrother Norr.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:30.069
Usually, that put a little bit of fury in you, but I knew I hadn't done anything terribly wrong, so...

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:42.750
They said, well, we want you to come up and work in the office and take over the desk and took care of the missionary's visas, getting them to their assignments.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.750
Well, back in those days, this was in the 50s.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:56.789
Generally, air fares were pretty high, but most were sent out at that time by not a fancy ship, but a cargo ship.

00:02:56.789 --> 00:03:03.349
The missionaries didn't mind that slowboat trip to their assignment.

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:14.150
Gradually, air fares came down, and we began to use airplanes to get most of the brothers to their assignments.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:22.310
Brother Norr, as the branches expanded, saw the need to get out and visit the branches.

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:36.229
So that desk, which became the travel desk, would arrange for flights, so the work got started for travel in that way, and then we expanded later on, of course.

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:43.150
Since 2013, the World Headquarters Travel Department has continued to manage this ever-increasing task.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.430
What travel is arranged?

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.229
International transfers for special full-time service.

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:53.669
Travel for medical reasons.

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:58.389
Fagiliate and other theocratic schools, and much more.

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:04.669
Some 80 branch officers around the world have thus far been assisted.

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:14.199
How does World Headquarters Travel save valuable kingdom funds?

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:17.120
Imagine yourself on a plane.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.040
You paid $500 for your ticket, and you were happy with that price.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.319
Talking to the person on your left, you learned that he paid $800.

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:31.839
Now you're really happy.

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:37.519
But the person on your right paid just $300.

00:04:37.519 --> 00:04:40.560
This is often the reality with travel.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:48.839
Using a global booking tool, World Headquarters Travel works hard to avoid paying the higher prices.

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:54.120
We lock in the middle price and then search for the cheapest.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.920
Sometimes we search for weeks for prices to drop.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.839
I have searched for some bookings for months to get better prices, and I have found them.

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:07.480
Also, we use donated airline credits and mileage to purchase tickets.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.079
By consolidating various travel that is done worldwide,

00:05:11.079 --> 00:05:14.839
we're able to obtain discounts with airlines and suppliers,

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:18.920
and by these agreements, we're able to have access to lower fares,

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.120
additional checked luggage, along with free day changes.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.759
Many automated systems are also used.

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:27.800
For example, even after a ticket is purchased,

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.680
we have a program that will continually reprice the ticket,

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.399
checking for a lower fare up until the departure date.

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:40.199
In 2016, a program was released in the United States

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:44.800
to allow for donations of transferable hotel points,

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.040
airline miles and credits, along with gift cards.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:55.120
The program, Donate Rewards Points, helps us to reduce travel costs.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.759
One couple that were determined to simplify their life,

00:05:57.759 --> 00:05:59.879
redeemed many of their rewards programs,

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:02.279
their donations saved thousands of dollars,

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:05.680
and many of their rewards points would have otherwise just expired.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.439
One Bethel couple decided to donate their personal airline miles,

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:12.920
over 200,000.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:18.240
Their donation allowed the organization to save $7,000.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.720
Along with their travel, the organization's wise use of hotel points

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.920
has conserved donated funds.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.560
When our brothers and sisters plan to attend conventions

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.959
and assemblies or visit Bethel,

00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:34.079
they're often provided a list of hotels with room rates

00:06:34.079 --> 00:06:36.199
the branch has negotiated.

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:38.600
Just as frequent flyers earn mileage,

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.360
the organization earns hotel points.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.639
These points are then redeemed to meet travel needs throughout the world.

00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:52.220
For over 100 years,

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.740
theocratic conventions have brought encouragement,

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:00.259
excitement and joy to God's servants.

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:07.620
In 1886, the watchtower invited readers to a three-day general meeting,

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.300
following the memorial of Christ death.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:17.259
Thus beginning our rich history of annual conventions.

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:24.180
The year 1922 saw a landmark convention in Cedar Point, Ohio,

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:29.540
with attendees from the United States and Europe.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:36.459
By 1950, delegates were attending conventions from 67 lands,

00:07:36.459 --> 00:07:42.660
and by 1958, from 123 lands.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:47.660
Over 50 years later, our conventions continue to grow.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:52.740
In August 2018, congregations learned that in 2019,

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:59.100
international conventions will be held in 24 locations.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:04.939
A record number of invited delegates are receiving help in planning their travel.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:06.819
Once selected as delegates,

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:11.300
brothers and sisters log on to JW2019.org,

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:15.459
a website organized under the Teaching Committee office.

00:08:15.459 --> 00:08:19.660
Delegates can select hotels and airlines with discounted rates.

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:23.860
For activities, besides having a day planned for field service

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:26.860
and an evening gathering with the local friends,

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:31.540
delegates can also indicate which branch-sponsored activities they prefer,

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.940
such as a visit to the branch office,

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:37.419
or possibly a tour of local attractions.

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:43.980
Similar preparations are made for thousands of missionaries and full-time servants.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:49.899
Bethel's travel website allows them to search for flights.

00:08:49.899 --> 00:08:54.460
Select an itinerary and submit their choices

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:58.299
to World Headquarters Travel for processing.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:02.220
Then the excited missionaries, along with their family and friends,

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:07.980
can focus on the spiritual refreshment that the conventions bring.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:12.059
And all of us are looking forward to meeting these missionaries

00:09:12.059 --> 00:09:14.980
from many distant lands.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:21.879
What an exciting year it will be with the international conventions.

00:09:21.879 --> 00:09:26.159
No doubt, God's organisation will keep traveling

00:09:26.159 --> 00:09:29.120
to the most distant parts of the earth

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.919
to accomplish Jehovah's will until the end comes.
