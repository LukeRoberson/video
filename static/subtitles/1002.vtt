00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:17.510
Greetings, brothers and sisters.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.510
Our next music video presentation is about to begin.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.510
As you watch it, please reflect on how you can imitate the faith of your brothers and sisters.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.510
Please enjoy the presentation.

00:00:55.619 --> 00:09:54.649
Welcome to this session of our Powerful by Faith Convention, which corresponds to the Sunday morning session and your

00:09:54.649 --> 00:09:56.649
printed program.

00:09:56.649 --> 00:10:04.649
The theme is Jesus' promise recorded at Matthew 21-21, which says in part,

00:10:04.649 --> 00:10:09.649
if you have faith, it will happen.

00:10:09.649 --> 00:10:18.649
We invite you to sing together song number 137, faithful women Christian sisters.

00:10:18.649 --> 00:13:03.509
Again, that song number 137.

00:13:03.509 --> 00:13:10.509
Sadly, some consider women as being inferior to men and of little worth.

00:13:10.509 --> 00:13:12.509
How untrue.

00:13:12.509 --> 00:13:20.509
As we'll see in this eight-part symposium, there is a bunch that we can learn from women of faith.

00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:24.509
Each speaker will introduce the one to follow.

00:13:24.509 --> 00:13:30.509
To begin, let's give our attention to brother Kenneth Cook and member of the governing body.

00:13:30.509 --> 00:13:45.740
As he presents the talk entitled, imitate women of strong faith, Sarah.

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:50.740
In our life experience, there are many people we do not forget, both good and bad.

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:58.740
But those we delight to call to mind or remember are the people most important and most love to us.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.740
This is true of Jehovah as well.

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:09.740
He knows everyone who has ever lived, righteous and unrighteous, and he will resurrect millions of them.

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:20.740
But what he finds the greatest delight in is remembering those with strong faith who became his friends, including many faithful women.

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:25.740
His word is filled with accounts of women who had strong faith.

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:31.740
This symposium will consider faithful women from the past with various backgrounds.

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:40.740
We will learn why they needed faith, how they showed faith, and how all of us can imitate their faith.

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:44.740
We begin with the faithful woman, Sarah.

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:48.740
Sarah needed faith. Why?

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:56.740
Well, because like her husband, Abraham, Sarah accepted a nomadic lifestyle when Jehovah directed them to do so.

00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:09.740
Hebrews 118 says of Abraham that by faith, he obeyed by going out to a place that he was to receive as an inheritance, although not knowing where he was going.

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:15.740
What was true for Abraham was true for Sarah as well.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:23.740
Along with Abraham, she complied with Jehovah's direction and she left the prosperous city of Er.

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:29.740
She no doubt had to leave behind her relatives, as well as material advantages.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:33.740
We read at Genesis 12 and verse 1 that Abraham was told,

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:38.740
go out from your land and away from your relatives.

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:41.740
Such moves are never easy.

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:52.740
Actually, moving is known to be one of the most stressful things that people must do at times, especially when it involves moving away from friends and relatives.

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:57.740
Yes, Sarah needed faith and she had it.

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:05.740
She cooperated with her husband's direction, which meant accepting a completely different way of life.

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:10.740
Her obedience revealed her strong faith in Jehovah.

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:18.299
As you watch the following video, imagine the challenges that Sarah faced.

00:16:18.299 --> 00:16:21.299
Life in Er was comfortable.

00:16:21.299 --> 00:16:24.299
We had all the modern conveniences.

00:16:24.299 --> 00:16:28.299
Then Jehovah gave us an assignment we never expected.

00:16:28.299 --> 00:16:33.299
One that meant saying goodbye to the life we loved.

00:16:33.299 --> 00:16:38.299
But rather than look behind, Abraham and I looked ahead.

00:16:38.299 --> 00:16:46.299
We had seen Jehovah's hand in our lives and we knew he would be with us every step of the journey.

00:16:46.299 --> 00:16:50.299
And he was in ways that surprised us.

00:16:50.299 --> 00:16:53.299
Ways we never could have imagined.

00:16:53.299 --> 00:16:59.299
Jehovah did more than help us. He fulfilled his every promise.

00:16:59.299 --> 00:17:08.779
As accurately depicted in that video, how did Sarah show faith?

00:17:08.779 --> 00:17:11.779
She showed faith by looking ahead.

00:17:11.779 --> 00:17:15.779
She also reflected on what Jehovah had already done for them.

00:17:15.779 --> 00:17:19.779
Abraham and Sarah had seen Jehovah's hand in their lives.

00:17:19.779 --> 00:17:22.779
They were his friends. They obeyed before.

00:17:22.779 --> 00:17:26.779
And Jehovah had confidence in their obedience now.

00:17:26.779 --> 00:17:34.779
As a woman of strong faith, Sarah trusted that Jehovah would continue to be with them in their new assignment.

00:17:34.779 --> 00:17:38.779
She willingly gave up the comforts and conveniences of her.

00:17:38.779 --> 00:17:41.779
And her faith in God did not go unrewarded.

00:17:41.779 --> 00:17:46.779
In time, she received a blessing that she never could have anticipated.

00:17:46.779 --> 00:17:51.779
Sarah's faith in Jehovah led to the birth of Isaac.

00:17:51.779 --> 00:17:58.779
What made this blessing especially remarkable is described for us at Hebrews chapter 11 verses 11 and 12.

00:17:58.779 --> 00:18:01.779
Let's read those verses.

00:18:01.779 --> 00:18:06.779
Hebrews chapter 11 lists a number of faithful servants of God.

00:18:06.779 --> 00:18:09.779
Sarah is mentioned along with Abraham.

00:18:09.779 --> 00:18:15.779
As we read starting in verse 11, notice how the focus is on faith.

00:18:15.779 --> 00:18:20.779
By faith, also Sarah received power to conceive offspring,

00:18:20.779 --> 00:18:26.779
even when she was past the age, since she considered him faithful who made the promise.

00:18:26.779 --> 00:18:32.779
For this reason, from one man who was as good as dead, there were born children,

00:18:32.779 --> 00:18:41.779
as many as the stars of heaven in number and as innumerable as the sands by the seaside.

00:18:41.779 --> 00:18:47.779
So what remarkable blessing did Sarah receive as a result of her faith?

00:18:47.779 --> 00:18:53.779
The power to conceive offspring even when she was past the age it said.

00:18:53.779 --> 00:18:57.779
But how specifically did she show faith?

00:18:57.779 --> 00:19:03.779
She showed faith because she considered him faithful who had made the promise.

00:19:03.779 --> 00:19:08.779
Sarah had faith in Jehovah's promise that Abraham would become the father to many.

00:19:08.779 --> 00:19:11.779
Abraham needed faith, but so did Sarah.

00:19:11.779 --> 00:19:15.779
And because they both had such faith, verse 12 says,

00:19:15.779 --> 00:19:19.779
for this reason there were born children.

00:19:19.779 --> 00:19:25.779
Now some might say, but I recall from the scriptures that Sarah laughed when she heard that she would give birth.

00:19:25.779 --> 00:19:28.779
True, but was that because she lacked faith?

00:19:28.779 --> 00:19:30.779
Not at all.

00:19:30.779 --> 00:19:34.779
We read a moment ago that Sarah considered Jehovah faithful.

00:19:34.779 --> 00:19:38.779
In other words, she trusted him. So what happened?

00:19:38.779 --> 00:19:46.779
We evidently the thought of giving birth at her age struck her as being so unusual that she could not hold back laughing to herself.

00:19:46.779 --> 00:19:53.779
So while she was only all too human, she was undeniably a woman of strong faith.

00:19:53.779 --> 00:20:03.779
Years later, Sarah's faith in Jehovah's promise concerning Isaac moved her to speak up when five-year-old Isaac was persecuted or bullied by 19-year-old Ishmael.

00:20:04.779 --> 00:20:12.779
She saw a real threat to the well-being of Isaac, and her faith reminded her that Isaac was more than just her son.

00:20:12.779 --> 00:20:20.779
He was assigned a key role in Jehovah's purpose, so she mustered up courage and spoke up in his defense.

00:20:20.779 --> 00:20:24.779
Strong faith helps us to do many things.

00:20:24.779 --> 00:20:32.779
In the following dramatization, take note of how a husband and wife show faith like that of Abraham and Sarah.

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:42.730
Saying goodbye?

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:44.730
It's never easy.

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:54.230
And even though we were excited about our new LDC assignment, it was going to take us further than we'd ever been.

00:20:54.230 --> 00:21:08.660
It wasn't just a new routine.

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:11.660
It was a whole new way of life.

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:30.700
With each new move and project, we thought about Sarah.

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.700
She focused on the good things ahead.

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:38.660
And not on what she had left behind.

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.660
And that's what we tried to do.

00:21:40.660 --> 00:22:18.180
Jehovah's been so good to us.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:53.799
We didn't always know where the next project would take us.

00:22:53.799 --> 00:23:01.009
But we did know that Jehovah would be with us every step of the way.

00:23:01.009 --> 00:23:18.349
As demonstrated in that video, we can strengthen our faith by meditating on Jehovah's goodness to his people in the past and his goodness to his people today.

00:23:18.349 --> 00:23:26.349
Take time to meditate on how Jehovah has helped you when you've made sacrifices in his service.

00:23:26.349 --> 00:23:36.349
As the sister in the video stated, Sarah focused on the good things ahead and not on what she had left behind.

00:23:36.349 --> 00:23:45.349
We show faith like that of Sarah's when we support the decisions that are made by God's organization today.

00:23:45.349 --> 00:23:51.349
Imitate Sarah's faith and follow Jehovah's direction closely.

00:23:51.349 --> 00:23:58.349
When we are obedient to Jehovah's direction, then as Hebrews 13, 17 states,

00:23:58.349 --> 00:24:04.349
the brothers may carry out their responsibilities with joy and not with sign.

00:24:04.349 --> 00:24:10.349
For married sisters, this means displaying a Sarah-like spirit in their marriage.

00:24:10.349 --> 00:24:16.349
A Christian wife respects and supports her husband in doing Jehovah's will.

00:24:16.349 --> 00:24:22.349
The Apostle Peter wrote that such a spirit has great value in the eyes of God.

00:24:22.349 --> 00:24:28.349
What are some of the many ways in which sisters today display faith like Sarah's?

00:24:28.349 --> 00:24:35.349
Well, many Christian women of strong faith are supportive of their husbands in the circuit work.

00:24:35.349 --> 00:24:45.349
Many others leave family behind when accepting an assignment from local design construction or the school for kingdom evangelizers.

00:24:45.349 --> 00:24:51.349
And many sisters serving at Bethel do so far away from their families.

00:24:51.349 --> 00:24:54.349
And this is true of single sisters as well.

00:24:54.349 --> 00:25:02.349
All of these and many more show Sarah-like faith by trusting in Jehovah's loving care

00:25:02.349 --> 00:25:06.349
and making themselves available in his service.

00:25:06.349 --> 00:25:11.349
We are confident that Jehovah sees these acts of faith.

00:25:11.349 --> 00:25:17.349
Hebrews 13, 16 says that God is well pleased with such sacrifices.

00:25:17.349 --> 00:25:23.349
So see their example and imitate their faith.

00:25:23.349 --> 00:25:30.349
Brother James Mance, a helper to the writing committee, will now present the next talk in this symposium.

00:25:30.349 --> 00:25:34.349
Imitate women of strong faith, Rahab.

00:25:34.349 --> 00:25:48.079
Two Israelite men sneak into the city of Jericho.

00:25:48.079 --> 00:25:50.079
The men are spies.

00:25:50.079 --> 00:25:53.079
They take refuge in a place where they feel no one will notice them.

00:25:53.079 --> 00:25:56.079
The home of a prostitute, Rahab.

00:25:56.079 --> 00:26:01.079
And little does Rahab know how the visit of these two men will affect her life.

00:26:01.079 --> 00:26:05.079
But someone recognizes the spies and they notify the king.

00:26:05.079 --> 00:26:09.079
The king sends men to take the spies into custody.

00:26:10.079 --> 00:26:16.079
As the king's men bang on the door, Rahab is confronted with a life or death decision,

00:26:16.079 --> 00:26:22.079
a decision that will affect her livelihood and the lives of everyone in her family.

00:26:22.079 --> 00:26:25.079
Will she take a stand for Jehovah's people?

00:26:25.079 --> 00:26:29.079
Or will she side with the king of Jericho?

00:26:29.079 --> 00:26:34.079
As you watch the following video, imagine the challenges that Rahab faced

00:26:34.079 --> 00:26:41.859
and notice what helped her to make a life-saving decision.

00:26:41.859 --> 00:26:43.859
Jericho was doomed.

00:26:43.859 --> 00:26:45.859
People were scared.

00:26:45.859 --> 00:26:50.859
When the Israelite men showed up at my door, there was barely time to think.

00:26:50.859 --> 00:26:53.859
But I knew what was at stake.

00:26:53.859 --> 00:26:57.859
Even as a young girl, I had heard all the stories.

00:26:57.859 --> 00:27:00.859
Jehovah wasn't like the other gods.

00:27:00.859 --> 00:27:07.859
He had dried up the waters of the Red Sea and given his people victory over the Emirates.

00:27:07.859 --> 00:27:14.109
If I helped these men, I knew Jehovah would help me.

00:27:14.109 --> 00:27:23.390
For the first time in my life, I was standing with Jehovah's people on Jehovah's side.

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:27.390
And my faith was being rewarded.

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:35.940
The spies were probably the first Israelites that Rahab had ever met.

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:41.940
But she was convinced that if she helped the two men, that Jehovah would help her.

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:43.940
Why did she feel that way?

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:48.940
Please open your Bibles to Hebrews chapter 11 and we're going to read verse 31.

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:53.940
And here we find the answer to that question in a single word.

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:56.940
Hebrews 11-31 says,

00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:07.940
By faith, Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who acted disobediently because she received the spies in a peaceable way.

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:14.940
Yes, Rahab took a decisive stand based on her faith in what she had heard about Jehovah,

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:21.940
how he had delivered his people at the Red Sea, how he had given them victories over nearby kings.

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:28.940
The account in Joshua chapter 2 describes the significant sequence of events.

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:33.940
Rahab had already hidden the spies on her roof before the kingsmen arrived.

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:39.940
And after sending the kingsmen away, she went back up to the roof to talk to the spies.

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:43.940
There she explained to them the reasons for her faith.

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:48.940
And she expressed confidence that Jehovah is the true God

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:54.940
and that Jehovah would give his people victory over Jericho.

00:28:54.940 --> 00:29:01.940
Only then did she ask the spies for protection for herself and her family.

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:06.940
So Rahab's faith was not based on the promise of a reward.

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:15.940
Rather, her faith was based on her firm conviction that Jehovah is the Almighty God.

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:19.940
Rahab's faith gave her courage to hide and protect the spies.

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:25.940
And then her faith moved her to obey the spies on usual instructions.

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:37.619
In the following dramatization, notice how a young Bible student shows faith like that of Rahab.

00:29:37.619 --> 00:29:44.619
There was no doubt about it. I had found the truth.

00:29:44.619 --> 00:30:12.039
So why did I feel so anxious? I knew how mom felt about the holidays.

00:30:12.039 --> 00:30:29.559
But I also learned how Jehovah felt. They displeased him.

00:30:29.559 --> 00:30:52.750
Some changes in my life were easy to make. But I really needed Jehovah's help for what I had to do next.

00:30:52.750 --> 00:31:02.529
I loved my mom so much. When I explained that I wouldn't celebrate the holidays anymore,

00:31:02.529 --> 00:31:13.609
I could tell that she was hurt. But I knew I was doing the right thing.

00:31:13.609 --> 00:31:16.609
And prayed that Jehovah would help her understand.

00:31:16.609 --> 00:31:26.930
Holiday season like no other, like this 36 megapixel DSLR camera kit for just $3.99.

00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:31.930
Or would you believe this 65-inch 4K UHG Smart TV is only $8.49?

00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:33.930
Hurry in before it's gone because the...

00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:57.769
I admit I was surprised when she said she wanted to learn more.

00:31:57.769 --> 00:31:59.769
What a blessing.

00:31:59.769 --> 00:32:06.769
Thanks to Jehovah, I have found the truth. And now maybe my family would find it too.

00:32:06.769 --> 00:32:18.779
Like Rahab, this Bible student had already identified the true God.

00:32:18.779 --> 00:32:25.779
She was convinced that she had found the truth. But now she needed to act on that faith.

00:32:25.779 --> 00:32:30.779
And she was blessed when she took a stand on Jehovah's side.

00:32:31.779 --> 00:32:38.779
Each of us must ask ourselves, am I standing firmly on Jehovah's side?

00:32:38.779 --> 00:32:42.779
Perhaps you feel that you don't have enough knowledge to take a stand?

00:32:42.779 --> 00:32:48.779
If so, imitate Rahab and do not hesitate.

00:32:48.779 --> 00:32:53.779
What little knowledge Rahab had about Jehovah was enough to give her faith

00:32:53.779 --> 00:32:58.779
that moved her to take prompt, obedient action.

00:32:58.779 --> 00:33:03.779
But Rahab had to do more than protect the spies and follow their instructions.

00:33:03.779 --> 00:33:11.779
James chapter 2, verse 25, states that Rahab was declared righteous by her works.

00:33:11.779 --> 00:33:18.779
Remember, she was a prostitute, a work that is not in harmony with Jehovah's righteous standards.

00:33:18.779 --> 00:33:22.779
The Canaanites didn't view prostitution as something bad.

00:33:22.779 --> 00:33:28.779
However, in order to be accepted as one of Jehovah's clean worshipers,

00:33:28.779 --> 00:33:33.779
Rahab had to abandon her immoral way of life.

00:33:33.779 --> 00:33:43.779
Likewise today, all who want to please Jehovah must abandon any lifestyles or conduct that displeases him.

00:33:43.779 --> 00:33:49.779
This includes sexual immorality, idolatry, theft, drunkenness,

00:33:49.779 --> 00:33:53.779
and customs that are not in harmony with the Scriptures.

00:33:53.779 --> 00:34:02.190
Rahab and her family certainly were grateful that her faithful actions led to their salvation.

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:07.190
But that wasn't all that Jehovah did to bless this woman of strong faith.

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:14.190
She also had the privilege of becoming an ancestor of the Messiah, Jesus Christ.

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:23.190
Therefore, may all of us imitate the faith of Rahab and may that faith move us to action,

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:32.190
to abandon immoral conduct and false religious customs, to take our stand for Jehovah and his pure worship,

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:40.190
to continue to grow in knowledge of God and to draw closer to Him as our loving Heavenly Father.

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:48.190
If we show faith like that of Rahab, we will enjoy Jehovah's favor and blessing forever.

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:55.190
Brother Ken Flodin, a helper to the Teaching Committee, will now present the next talk of this symposium,

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:59.190
imitate women of strong faith, Hannah.

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:11.000
In the third talk of this convention, Brother Numeir asked,

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.000
have you experienced financial setback?

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:22.000
Has your child faced peer pressure and we could add or bullying in school?

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000
Do you have a life-threatening disease?

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000
We'd like to continue that list.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
Do you face scorn from workmates?

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000
Do you have a personality issue with someone?

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000
Do family members taunt you?

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Was we deal with various trials?

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000
We might recall the words of Paul.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:51.000
He said, the way I'm aiming my blows is so as not to be striking the air.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.000
Well, how do we counteract the adversities of this system?

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000
Please find 1 Samuel 1.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000
Hannah had two adversities,

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:10.000
and they were like, boom, boom, one, two punch, designed to drop her for the count.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.980
The first one is in verse 2 of chapter 1.

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:18.980
Now, Hannah had two wives.

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:21.980
One was named Hannah, and the other was named Pininna.

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:23.980
Well, that's polygamy.

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:27.980
And Pininna loathed, she hated Hannah.

00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:30.980
But what was the second problem?

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:33.980
It continues, Pininna had children,

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:35.980
but Hannah had no children.

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:37.980
Hannah was barren.

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:44.980
And in that culture, this was a bitter reproach for a woman.

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:49.980
Well, it was devious, uncouth, Pininna really like.

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:51.980
Let's read verse 6.

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:56.980
Moreover, her rival wife pondered her relentlessly in order to upset her.

00:36:56.980 --> 00:37:01.980
She did this on purpose, because Jehovah had not given her children.

00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:03.980
And look at the end of verse 7.

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:10.980
Her rival would taunt her so much that Hannah would weep and not eat.

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:16.980
As you watch the following artwork, imagine Hannah's distressing circumstance

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:20.980
and then how faith turned it all around.

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:26.550
I couldn't sleep or eat.

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:30.550
I felt my hopes and dreams slipping away.

00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:36.550
But even if no one else really understood me, I knew Jehovah would.

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:40.829
I told him everything.

00:37:40.829 --> 00:37:49.829
I knew that the God of justice would set all matters right in his own time and in his own way.

00:37:49.829 --> 00:37:54.829
Jehovah answered my prayer in such a wonderful way.

00:37:54.829 --> 00:38:00.829
I never forgot where this incredible blessing had come from.

00:38:00.829 --> 00:38:08.190
There is no rock like our God.

00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:12.190
Did you see the grief on Hannah's face in that first picture?

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:16.190
The next piece of art, she's peaceful in tranquil.

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:20.190
And she's voicing her faith in Jehovah her rock.

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:26.190
From despair to calmness of heart, how did that happen?

00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:29.190
Versus 10 and 11.

00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:33.190
She demonstrated faith in several ways.

00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:40.190
And we can do the same as we face our own boom, boom, one, two punch of trials and frustrations of life.

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:43.190
Verse 10.

00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:52.190
Hannah was extremely bitter and she began to pray to Jehovah and to weep uncontrollably.

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:57.190
She was extremely bitter, but she prayed.

00:38:57.190 --> 00:39:02.190
She cried uncontrollably, but she prayed to Jehovah.

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:09.190
In your agonizing circumstances, no matter how agitated, find a quiet place.

00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:15.190
If only in your mind and pour out your heart to Jehovah.

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:19.190
Well, how else did Hannah show her faith?

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:24.190
Well, in that very prayer, she did ask Jehovah for a blessing,

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:28.190
but she also promised to give him something in return.

00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:29.190
Verse 11.

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:34.050
And she made this vow.

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:41.050
O Jehovah of armies, if you look upon the affliction of your servant and remember me,

00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:47.050
and you do not forget your servant, and give to your servant a male child,

00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:53.050
I will give him to Jehovah all the days of his life, and no razor will touch his head.

00:39:53.050 --> 00:40:02.050
Yes, she was going to give her son as a Nazareth from birth to serve Jehovah all his days,

00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:07.050
a sterling example of faith.

00:40:07.050 --> 00:40:11.050
Well, what else likely strengthened Hannah's faith?

00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:17.050
Examples of faithful women who came before her, with similar circumstances.

00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:22.050
Do you remember Rachel and her sister, Leah?

00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:28.050
They were both married to Jacob, and like Hannah, Rachel had no children.

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:31.050
And there were issues between the two because of this.

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:39.050
But you see, Hannah could look back on that example and see how Jehovah helped faithful Rachel to prosper.

00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:42.050
It bolstered her faith.

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:46.050
Well, what's another way that Hannah showed faith?

00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:52.050
Well, despite being distraught, so distraught that she would weep and could not eat,

00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:55.050
she continued her spiritual routine.

00:40:55.050 --> 00:41:02.050
Verse 7 says that she would go the tabernacle faithfully year after year.

00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:10.050
13 through 16, she was misjudged by the high priest, but she continued her spiritual routine.

00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:18.050
Now, as we said at the outset, the punches that life throws us are different from Hannah's,

00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:23.050
but we too can have the same strong faith that she did.

00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:28.050
Now, in the following dramatization, though the trial is different,

00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:32.050
note how the sister shows faith like that of Hannah.

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:43.860
I could tell from the doctor's voice the news wasn't good.

00:41:43.860 --> 00:42:06.230
I just didn't expect my health to worsen so quickly.

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:40.670
I tried to act like everything was fine, but I was fine.

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:48.460
I wasn't.

00:42:48.460 --> 00:43:10.110
Going to Jehovah, knowing he would listen and understand that's what got me through.

00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:18.099
No one really knew what I was going through.

00:43:18.099 --> 00:43:22.219
Not even my friends.

00:43:22.219 --> 00:43:46.190
I felt like Hannah totally misunderstood.

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:50.190
But she had faith that Jehovah would set matters straight.

00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:56.860
And he did.

00:43:56.860 --> 00:44:03.750
For Hannah and for me, but more than that,

00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:07.750
he reminded me that I wouldn't have to deal with this illness alone.

00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:16.030
The sister's circumstances were different,

00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:21.030
but she drew strength from Hannah's strong faith in Jehovah.

00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:24.030
No matter what the circumstances are,

00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:28.030
how can we imitate the example of that faith?

00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:31.030
Well, there's many different ways, but let's review a few.

00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:37.030
First Peter 5.9, Satan tries to beat us up and knock us down,

00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:39.030
but we're not alone.

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:42.030
There are others who experience the same trials.

00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:44.030
First Peter 5.9,

00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:52.590
but take your stand against him, firm in the faith,

00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:56.590
knowing that the same kind of sufferings are being experienced

00:44:56.590 --> 00:45:00.590
by the entire association of your brothers in the world.

00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:03.590
Reflect on Jehovah's dealings with other faithful ones,

00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:08.030
both in the past and in the present day.

00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:14.030
Now in 1 Samuel 112, it says that Hannah prayed for a long time

00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:16.030
before Jehovah.

00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:20.030
We too can gain relief through fervent, persistent,

00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:23.030
and specific prayers.

00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:26.030
Colossians 4 says persevere in prayer.

00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:29.030
When we pray to Jehovah,

00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:34.030
leave it with him, confident that he will help.

00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:37.030
And recall that Hannah was extremely bitter.

00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:39.030
She was crying uncontrollably.

00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:43.030
But after she poured her feelings out to Jehovah,

00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:45.030
verse 18 says,

00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:47.030
she went on her way and ate,

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:51.030
and her face was no longer downcast.

00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:54.030
And then after Jehovah acted in her behalf,

00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:56.030
Hannah remembered that,

00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:58.030
and she went back to Jehovah in prayer

00:45:58.030 --> 00:46:04.030
and prayed the beautiful prayer in 1 Samuel 2.

00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:06.030
Finally, like Hannah,

00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:08.030
even if discouraged,

00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:12.030
we need to maintain a good spiritual routine.

00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:17.030
If we allow distress to paralyze us,

00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:22.030
in effect, we become a stationary punching bag for Satan.

00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:24.030
Stay nimble on your feet spiritually,

00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:28.030
active in your theocratic routine.

00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:30.030
And like Paul, aim your blows.

00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:32.030
Do not strike the air.

00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:36.030
Fight back against Satan and his tactics.

00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:38.030
If we do all these things,

00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:43.030
our bond with Jehovah will grow ever stronger.

00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:45.030
And,

00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:51.030
Jehovah will reward our faith like he did for Hannah.

00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:53.030
And now, Brother Harold Corcoran,

00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:55.030
a helper for the publishing committee,

00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:58.030
will present the next talk of this symposium,

00:46:58.030 --> 00:47:01.030
imitate women of strong faith,

00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:03.030
the captive Israelite girl.

00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:12.710
In the 11th century BCE,

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:16.710
the nation of Syria would often attack Israel,

00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:19.710
capturing many and making many of their slaves,

00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:21.710
even children.

00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:24.710
Notice how the Bible describes one of these raids

00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:27.710
at 2 Kings chapter 5.

00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:29.710
2 Kings chapter 5,

00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:31.710
and in verse 1,

00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:35.710
we are told that Naomi was the army chief of the Syrians.

00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:37.710
He was a mighty warrior,

00:47:37.710 --> 00:47:40.710
but he was also very sick with leprosy.

00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:42.710
But notice verse 2.

00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:44.710
On wonder of their raids,

00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:47.710
the Syrians had taken captive from the land of Israel,

00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:48.710
a little girl,

00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:51.710
who became a servant to Naaman's wife.

00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:54.710
Can you picture this little girl being ripped away

00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:55.710
from her parents?

00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:57.710
It was frightening for her.

00:47:57.710 --> 00:47:59.710
She was taken to a strange land

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:01.710
with people that were intimidating,

00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:04.710
and they worshipped many false gods.

00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:08.710
In that very difficult circumstance,

00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:11.710
how was this little girl required

00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:14.710
to exercise strong faith?

00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:16.710
Please note the answer to this question

00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:21.820
and the following video.

00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:25.820
I remember the day the soldiers took me away.

00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:28.820
I had never felt more alone.

00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:31.820
My home, my friends,

00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:34.820
everything I knew was gone.

00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:37.820
But I still had Jehovah.

00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:43.829
The master of the house was very sick.

00:48:43.829 --> 00:48:46.829
He was in pain.

00:48:46.829 --> 00:48:48.829
Elijah could help him.

00:48:48.829 --> 00:48:51.829
I had heard about Elijah's miracles.

00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:54.829
He had even raised the dead.

00:48:54.829 --> 00:48:57.829
I knew Elijah could cure him,

00:48:57.829 --> 00:49:01.829
and Jehovah gave me the courage to speak up.

00:49:01.829 --> 00:49:08.539
Despite being away from her parents,

00:49:08.539 --> 00:49:12.539
this little girl exercised strong faith.

00:49:12.539 --> 00:49:14.539
Where did she get that faith?

00:49:14.539 --> 00:49:16.539
Well, no doubt her parents had inculcated

00:49:16.539 --> 00:49:19.539
love and trust for Jehovah in her.

00:49:19.539 --> 00:49:22.539
But she also had things that were happening

00:49:22.539 --> 00:49:25.539
in her lifetime that would build her faith.

00:49:25.539 --> 00:49:27.539
For example, she would have known

00:49:27.539 --> 00:49:31.539
about the miracles of the prophet Elijah.

00:49:31.539 --> 00:49:33.539
And how was Jehovah's Spirit?

00:49:33.539 --> 00:49:35.539
He performed many miracles,

00:49:35.539 --> 00:49:39.539
including raising a little boy from the dead.

00:49:39.539 --> 00:49:41.539
This little girl could have reason.

00:49:41.539 --> 00:49:45.539
Why if Jehovah can raise a little boy from death?

00:49:45.539 --> 00:49:50.539
He can certainly cure my master from his disease.

00:49:50.539 --> 00:49:53.539
Well, what did she do with this faith and trust?

00:49:53.539 --> 00:49:55.539
She spoke up courageously.

00:49:55.539 --> 00:49:57.539
Notice her words to her mistress

00:49:57.539 --> 00:50:02.539
as recorded at Second Kings chapter 5 and verse 3.

00:50:02.539 --> 00:50:04.539
She said to her mistress,

00:50:04.539 --> 00:50:08.539
if only my Lord would visit the prophet in Samaria,

00:50:08.539 --> 00:50:12.539
then He would cure him of his laprosy.

00:50:12.539 --> 00:50:14.539
Such bonus.

00:50:14.539 --> 00:50:16.539
And because she spoke up,

00:50:16.539 --> 00:50:19.539
Naman went to Israel,

00:50:19.539 --> 00:50:23.539
God in touch with Elijah the prophet,

00:50:23.539 --> 00:50:24.539
humbled himself,

00:50:24.539 --> 00:50:26.539
listened to the instructions,

00:50:26.539 --> 00:50:30.539
and was completely cured of the laprosy.

00:50:30.539 --> 00:50:33.539
But something else very important occurred.

00:50:33.539 --> 00:50:36.539
Because of Naman coming to know about Jehovah,

00:50:36.539 --> 00:50:38.539
what did he declare?

00:50:38.539 --> 00:50:40.539
At Second Kings 5, 15, he said,

00:50:40.539 --> 00:50:44.539
Now I know there is no God anywhere in the earth,

00:50:44.539 --> 00:50:46.539
but in Israel.

00:50:46.539 --> 00:50:50.539
And Naman also vowed that he would never serve any other gods,

00:50:50.539 --> 00:50:53.539
but Jehovah.

00:50:53.539 --> 00:50:57.539
How happy Naman and his entire household was when he went home.

00:50:57.539 --> 00:50:59.539
Not only was he cured of his laprosy,

00:50:59.539 --> 00:51:05.539
but now he was a happy, joyful servant of Jehovah.

00:51:05.539 --> 00:51:07.539
Well, it's not just in Bible times

00:51:07.539 --> 00:51:10.539
that good experiences like this have occurred.

00:51:10.539 --> 00:51:13.539
As you watch the following dramatization,

00:51:13.539 --> 00:51:15.539
notice how one of our sisters

00:51:15.539 --> 00:51:17.539
shows strong faith

00:51:17.539 --> 00:51:20.539
even under the most difficult of circumstances.

00:51:20.539 --> 00:51:27.150
I was taken from my home,

00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:32.460
my husband,

00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:34.460
and my spiritual family.

00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:39.730
I was imprisoned for my faith.

00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:50.760
It was another world.

00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:52.760
It wasn't easy staying strong.

00:51:52.760 --> 00:52:05.170
Every time I asked for a Bible,

00:52:05.170 --> 00:52:07.170
the answer was no.

00:52:07.170 --> 00:52:19.500
But God's word was already in my heart.

00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:24.059
So I did what I loved the most.

00:52:24.059 --> 00:52:26.059
I talked about God's kingdom.

00:52:26.059 --> 00:52:32.949
Many of those I preached to seemed cold at first.

00:52:32.949 --> 00:52:35.949
But genuine love and the warmth of God's word

00:52:35.949 --> 00:52:40.489
just seemed to melt their hearts.

00:52:40.489 --> 00:52:45.489
Sometimes speaking up took more courage than I thought I had.

00:52:45.489 --> 00:52:49.489
But not more courage than Jehovah could give me.

00:52:49.489 --> 00:53:08.400
It was hard to look beyond the locks and uniforms.

00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:13.400
But God's will is that all sorts of people learn about him.

00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:17.400
So I spoke about my God, Jehovah.

00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:53.719
I knew that even behind prison bars,

00:53:53.719 --> 00:54:06.070
Jehovah would give me the strength to help others.

00:54:06.070 --> 00:54:10.070
At this point, we'd like to address our young ones in the audience.

00:54:10.070 --> 00:54:13.070
You too can have strong faith

00:54:13.070 --> 00:54:15.070
like the little Israelite girl

00:54:15.070 --> 00:54:18.070
and tell others about Jehovah.

00:54:18.070 --> 00:54:22.070
Remember the words of Romans chapter 10 verses 13 and 14?

00:54:22.070 --> 00:54:26.070
It is so important that people know about Jehovah.

00:54:26.070 --> 00:54:29.070
But how can they know about him and gain salvation

00:54:29.070 --> 00:54:32.070
if there's no one to preach?

00:54:32.070 --> 00:54:36.070
You too can become a bold and faithful preacher of the good news.

00:54:36.070 --> 00:54:37.070
How?

00:54:37.070 --> 00:54:42.070
By taking in Bible truths and building up strong faith in your heart.

00:54:42.070 --> 00:54:46.070
And then you'll be able to do like our sister did in the dramatization.

00:54:46.070 --> 00:54:48.070
Remember what she said?

00:54:48.070 --> 00:54:52.070
I had God's word in my heart and as a result,

00:54:52.070 --> 00:54:57.070
even in prison, when I was surrounded by all those difficulties,

00:54:57.070 --> 00:55:02.070
I did what I loved to do talk about God's kingdom.

00:55:02.070 --> 00:55:07.070
Another thing you can do is pray for more courage and faith.

00:55:07.070 --> 00:55:09.070
Remember what our sister said?

00:55:09.070 --> 00:55:13.070
It seemed that at times to speak up required more courage than I had.

00:55:13.070 --> 00:55:18.070
But not more courage than Jehovah could give me.

00:55:18.070 --> 00:55:25.070
So dear young ones, don't be afraid to talk about Jehovah and the truth

00:55:25.070 --> 00:55:31.070
to your schoolmates, to your unbelieving relatives, to your teachers.

00:55:31.070 --> 00:55:34.070
Good results will happen, for example.

00:55:34.070 --> 00:55:37.070
There is an experience of a schoolteacher here in the United States

00:55:37.070 --> 00:55:41.070
who had been searching for the basic questions as to the meaning of life,

00:55:41.070 --> 00:55:43.070
but she could not find them.

00:55:43.070 --> 00:55:48.070
But then her 12-year-old student at school asked the teacher three questions,

00:55:48.070 --> 00:55:50.070
the first question.

00:55:50.070 --> 00:55:52.070
Do you know I'm one of Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:55:52.070 --> 00:55:53.070
Yes.

00:55:53.070 --> 00:55:56.070
Would you like to learn more about Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:55:56.070 --> 00:55:58.070
Yes.

00:55:58.070 --> 00:55:59.070
Third question?

00:55:59.070 --> 00:56:01.070
Where do you live?

00:56:01.070 --> 00:56:05.070
Our 12-year-old sister started a study with her teacher.

00:56:05.070 --> 00:56:07.070
The teacher loved what she was hearing,

00:56:07.070 --> 00:56:11.070
made excellent progress and was baptized.

00:56:12.070 --> 00:56:15.070
That sister, the former schoolteacher,

00:56:15.070 --> 00:56:17.070
has been serving Jehovah now for many decades.

00:56:17.070 --> 00:56:20.070
In fact, for the last 40 years,

00:56:20.070 --> 00:56:24.070
she has been serving as a member of the United States Bethel family.

00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:29.070
So blessings come when we speak up and show strong faith.

00:56:29.070 --> 00:56:32.070
Remember in the case of the little Israelite girl,

00:56:32.070 --> 00:56:36.070
Naman would have never gone to Israel if she had not spoken up.

00:56:36.070 --> 00:56:39.070
And as a result, he was cured,

00:56:39.070 --> 00:56:42.070
but also became a servant of Jehovah.

00:56:42.070 --> 00:56:48.070
So in harmony with the strong faith of that captive Israelite girl,

00:56:48.070 --> 00:56:54.070
may Jehovah give all of us the courage we need to display our strong faith,

00:56:54.070 --> 00:57:00.449
even under the most stressful and even frightening circumstances.

00:57:00.449 --> 00:57:04.449
Brother Jeffrey Jackson will now consider the next talk of this symposium,

00:57:04.449 --> 00:57:17.739
imitate women of strong faith, Mary, the mother of Jesus.

00:57:17.739 --> 00:57:22.739
Jehovah chose the young woman Mary for a difficult assignment.

00:57:22.739 --> 00:57:28.739
It was a unique assignment, one that required great faith.

00:57:28.739 --> 00:57:36.739
It was to care for and raise the only begotten Son of God, Jesus Christ.

00:57:36.739 --> 00:57:40.739
What an amazing privilege that was.

00:57:41.739 --> 00:57:45.739
And yet it required strong faith on the part of Mary,

00:57:45.739 --> 00:57:49.739
not only because this was a very serious responsibility

00:57:49.739 --> 00:57:52.739
that would involve quite a number of years,

00:57:52.739 --> 00:57:57.739
but initially, Mary before accepting this assignment,

00:57:57.739 --> 00:57:59.739
had some concerns no doubt.

00:57:59.739 --> 00:58:04.739
One of them would have been the concern with regard to the reaction

00:58:04.739 --> 00:58:07.739
of her friends, neighbors, relatives,

00:58:07.739 --> 00:58:10.739
yes, of course, her fiance Joseph.

00:58:10.739 --> 00:58:14.739
After all, the angel didn't say to her, don't worry,

00:58:14.739 --> 00:58:18.739
I'll go and inform this of all the, to all the ones involved

00:58:18.739 --> 00:58:20.739
so that they don't get upset.

00:58:20.739 --> 00:58:26.739
So it was a very difficult and overwhelming assignment for Mary.

00:58:26.739 --> 00:58:29.739
Can you imagine how she approached this assignment?

00:58:29.739 --> 00:58:33.739
Well, to help us do that, let's watch this short video.

00:58:33.739 --> 00:58:38.659
I was engaged to Mary Joseph.

00:58:38.659 --> 00:58:41.659
I thought we would have a simple and quiet life,

00:58:41.659 --> 00:58:45.659
and then suddenly everything changed.

00:58:45.659 --> 00:58:49.659
I know that God sometimes asks us to do what is difficult,

00:58:49.659 --> 00:58:54.659
but this seemed impossible beyond anything we could handle,

00:58:54.659 --> 00:58:58.659
but I knew I was safe in Jehovah's hands.

00:58:58.659 --> 00:59:03.659
If we remained loyal to Him and did our best to care for His precious Son,

00:59:03.659 --> 00:59:08.659
He would always be loyal to us and give us what we needed.

00:59:08.659 --> 00:59:14.480
Yes, when we think of Mary's situation,

00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:18.480
all she was interested in was having a quiet, simple life,

00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:21.480
then suddenly everything changed for her.

00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:27.480
And it may have seemed impossible for her to be able to accept that assignment.

00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:30.480
And yet, what was her reaction?

00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:35.480
Well, please, take your Bibles and turn with me to the first chapter of Luke.

00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:38.480
And verse 38.

00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:42.480
Luke chapter 1 and verse 38.

00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:46.480
There we see Mary's reaction.

00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:54.480
Look, Jehovah's slave girl, may it happen to me according to your declaration.

00:59:54.480 --> 01:00:01.480
Yes, in full faith and with humility, she accepted this difficult assignment.

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:06.480
She knew that Jehovah would be with her and that he would help her.

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:11.480
But what was it that gave Mary such a strong faith?

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:17.480
Well, we get a clue if we look down in the same chapter, but verse 46.

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:20.480
So that's Luke chapter 1 and verse 46.

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:26.480
And we're not going to read the verse, but the study note associated with the verse.

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:33.480
Notice it says, Mary's words have praised the following verses 46 through 55,

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:40.480
contain well over 20 references to or illusions to the Hebrew Scriptures.

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:46.480
Mary's words give evidence of her spirituality and her knowledge of the Scriptures.

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:49.480
They show her appreciative attitude.

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:54.480
Her words also reveal the depth of her faith as she spoke of Jehovah

01:00:54.480 --> 01:01:02.480
as a basing the Hordean powerful and as helping the lowly and poor who seek to serve Him.

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:10.480
Yes, Mary's faith was based on her knowledge of God's Word of the Holy Scriptures that she had.

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:16.480
But it seems that she didn't have personal copies of these writings.

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:23.480
Rather, she must have memorized what she heard being read at the synagogue.

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:30.480
So Mary's heart was full of all of these expressions from the Hebrew Scriptures.

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:37.480
So much so that when she spontaneously praised Jehovah, all these expressions came out

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:41.480
because she had treasured them in her heart.

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:46.480
So yes, Mary had strong faith that was based on the Holy writings,

01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:52.480
and that is what made her qualified for this assignment.

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:54.480
Well, what about us?

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:59.480
How can we imitate this strong faith of Mary?

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:05.480
As we look at this dramatization, notice that although our assignments may be different,

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:09.480
we likewise need to have that same strong faith.

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:16.010
When they first told me, I thought it must have been a mistake.

01:02:16.010 --> 01:02:18.010
I mean, me?

01:02:18.010 --> 01:02:22.010
Oversee a department at an international convention.

01:02:22.010 --> 01:02:33.369
I felt like it was just too much to handle.

01:02:33.369 --> 01:02:47.320
I remembered that I thought the same thing years ago.

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:50.320
When I was asked to serve on a disaster relief committee,

01:02:50.320 --> 01:03:13.349
and when I served on the hospital liaison committee,

01:03:13.349 --> 01:03:34.190
actually, I've always felt that way when I've received an assignment from Jehovah.

01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:44.500
But what I've learned is, he's always ready to help.

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:59.289
So when Jehovah asked me to do something that seems difficult,

01:03:59.289 --> 01:04:07.570
I just remind myself to pray, stay loyal, and have faith.

01:04:07.570 --> 01:04:27.010
He'll give me what I need.

01:04:27.010 --> 01:04:38.300
Did you feel sorry for that young brother?

01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:41.300
Perhaps we can really understand his expressions.

01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:45.300
When they told me of the assignment, I thought it was a mistake.

01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:49.300
No doubt some of us have felt the same way at times too.

01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:52.300
But what helped this young brother?

01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:58.300
Well, he remembered how Jehovah had helped him in similar situations in the past.

01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:04.300
Remember how he thought back to the time when he was with the disaster committee?

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:10.300
And there he was standing as a young man and all these other men looking to him for some direction.

01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:12.300
That was very overwhelming.

01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:18.300
And then what about when he was to make the presentation as a HLC member?

01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:23.300
Remember sitting there in a corridor by himself and then this young woman ashes him into the room?

01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:26.300
She didn't look very friendly at all, did she?

01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:29.300
And certainly the medical staff didn't look very friendly.

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:33.300
So assignments like that can be overwhelming.

01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:35.300
But what did the young brother say?

01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:43.300
He said the things that helped him were prayer, stain loyal, and having faith.

01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:51.300
Yes, like Mary, we likewise can have this strong faith that pleases Jehovah.

01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:57.300
We need to display humility and have absolute confidence in Jehovah,

01:05:57.300 --> 01:06:01.300
a type of confidence that's expressed in the book of Psalms.

01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:08.300
Please turn with me to Psalm 56 and verses 3 and 4.

01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:13.300
Psalm 56, verses 3 and 4.

01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:20.300
When I am afraid, I put my trust in you, in God whose word I praise.

01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:24.300
In God I put my trust, I am not afraid.

01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:29.699
What can be a man due to me?

01:06:29.699 --> 01:06:36.699
Yes, just like the Psalmist and just like Mary, we can have full confidence in Jehovah.

01:06:36.699 --> 01:06:42.699
Yes, let us demonstrate this strong faith when we are faced with difficult assignments.

01:06:42.699 --> 01:06:49.699
Trust the in Jehovah, knowing that he will bless us, the same as he blessed Mary.

01:06:49.699 --> 01:06:54.699
The next part in our symposium will be handled by Brother Leonard Myers,

01:06:54.699 --> 01:06:57.699
who's a helper to the writing committee.

01:06:57.699 --> 01:07:04.699
He'll discuss the theme, imitate women of strong faith, the Phoenician woman.

01:07:04.699 --> 01:07:18.130
After the Passover 32 CE, Jesus and his disciples were in Phoenicia of Syria,

01:07:18.130 --> 01:07:21.130
north of the borders of Israel.

01:07:21.130 --> 01:07:25.130
Even in this non-Israelite territory, Jesus couldn't escape notice.

01:07:25.130 --> 01:07:30.130
Please open your Bibles to Matthew 15, and you may want to put a place marker there.

01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:39.130
Matthew 15, starting in verse 22, a Greek woman, born in Phoenicia, found Jesus and begged him to heal her daughter.

01:07:40.130 --> 01:07:45.130
The verse says that the girl was cruelly demon-possessed.

01:07:45.130 --> 01:07:50.130
Well, verse 23 says that Jesus did not say a word and answer to the mother.

01:07:50.130 --> 01:07:58.130
After a while, his disciples urged him, send her away because she keeps crying out after us.

01:07:58.130 --> 01:08:01.130
The mother was persistent.

01:08:01.130 --> 01:08:06.130
In response, Jesus explained his reason for ignoring her in verse 24.

01:08:06.130 --> 01:08:11.130
I was not sent to anyone except to the law sheep of the house of Israel.

01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:14.130
How would the woman respond?

01:08:14.130 --> 01:08:19.130
Would Jesus seeming rejection discourager? Would she lose faith?

01:08:19.130 --> 01:08:27.689
In the following video, look for evidence of the Phoenician woman's extraordinary faith.

01:08:27.689 --> 01:08:34.689
No, I was not Jewish, but I saw that this Jesus was no ordinary man.

01:08:34.689 --> 01:08:39.689
I had heard about his power to help others, and my daughter was suffering.

01:08:39.689 --> 01:08:46.689
I wouldn't take no for an answer. I couldn't. This man was from God.

01:08:46.689 --> 01:08:49.689
There was nowhere else to turn.

01:08:49.689 --> 01:08:52.689
I had faith in Jesus.

01:08:52.689 --> 01:08:57.689
When he heard me, he said, let it happen to you as you wish.

01:08:57.689 --> 01:09:02.000
And then it did!

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:13.890
My beautiful, precious daughter was healthy and smiling again.

01:09:13.890 --> 01:09:20.890
Because of her faith, the Phoenician woman overcame the fear of prejudice that could have prevented her from approaching Jesus.

01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:24.890
Remember, she was of Greek descent. Jesus was Jewish.

01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:33.890
But as stated in the video, she heard reports of Jesus' power to help others, and she realized that this man was from God.

01:09:33.890 --> 01:09:39.890
Notice in verse 22, she addressed Jesus as Lord Son of David.

01:09:39.890 --> 01:09:44.890
She publicly acknowledged that Jesus was the promised Messiah.

01:09:44.890 --> 01:09:51.890
And even though at first he didn't respond to her, and then explained his reason for doing so, she didn't become discouraged.

01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:59.390
Let's continue with the account in verse 25 to see the strong faith of this woman.

01:09:59.390 --> 01:10:05.390
But the woman came and did obeisance to him saying, Lord, help me.

01:10:05.390 --> 01:10:10.390
How Jesus must have been moved by the woman's heartfelt appeal.

01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:14.390
Apparently though, Jesus wanted to test her faith.

01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:26.390
Like a parent who plans to grant a child's request, but doesn't give an outward sign of that plan in order to test the child's seriousness, notice what Jesus tells her in verse 26.

01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:33.670
It is not right to take the bread of the children and throw it to the little dogs.

01:10:33.670 --> 01:10:40.670
Among the Greeks and Romans, the dog was often a beloved pet that lived in its owner's house and played with the children.

01:10:40.670 --> 01:10:49.670
The expression little dogs, or perhaps a house dog, might have reminded the woman of a warm and daring picture.

01:10:49.670 --> 01:10:58.670
By likening the Israelites to children and non-Jews to little dogs, Jesus evidently wanted to indicate an order of priority.

01:10:58.670 --> 01:11:03.670
In a household with both children and dogs, the children would be fed first.

01:11:03.670 --> 01:11:10.670
So Jesus meant that he couldn't care for non-Israelites at the expense of deserving Jews.

01:11:10.670 --> 01:11:17.670
Rather than take offense, the woman discerned the point of the illustration and humbly stated in verse 27.

01:11:17.670 --> 01:11:24.670
Yes, Lord, but really, the little dogs do eat of the crumbs falling from the table of their masters.

01:11:24.670 --> 01:11:27.670
What a beautiful response.

01:11:27.670 --> 01:11:32.670
And what was the result of the woman's remarkable faith? Verse 28.

01:11:32.670 --> 01:11:35.670
Then Jesus replied to her,

01:11:35.670 --> 01:11:41.670
Oh woman, great is your faith. Let it happen to you as you wish.

01:11:41.670 --> 01:11:46.670
And her daughter was healed from that hour on.

01:11:46.670 --> 01:11:50.670
The woman's faith was rewarded when Jesus healed her daughter.

01:11:50.670 --> 01:11:53.670
What an example of strong faith.

01:11:53.670 --> 01:12:04.979
In the following dramatization, note how someone who has just started to have a good relationship with God might need to display strong faith like that of the Phoenician woman.

01:12:04.979 --> 01:12:14.560
I never thought it would happen. I finally found what I'd been searching for.

01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:19.479
A good relationship with God.

01:12:19.479 --> 01:12:28.810
Then one day, a coworker texted an article that claimed to expose Jehovah's Witnesses.

01:12:28.810 --> 01:12:45.390
I was tempted to read it, and then I thought back to when I first met Jehovah's Witnesses.

01:12:45.390 --> 01:12:57.050
I was so excited about what they taught me from the Bible.

01:12:57.050 --> 01:13:00.050
That God's name is Jehovah,

01:13:00.050 --> 01:13:04.050
the kingdom is a real government, and so much more.

01:13:04.050 --> 01:13:09.869
Why would I want to learn about Jehovah's Witnesses from their enemies?

01:13:09.869 --> 01:13:23.270
But my friends, not so much.

01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:41.409
I saw people who really love one another.

01:13:41.409 --> 01:13:45.899
It's a real brotherhood.

01:13:45.899 --> 01:13:53.970
But it wasn't just the people. This was the truth.

01:13:53.970 --> 01:14:24.020
I didn't need to learn about Jehovah's Witnesses from their enemies.

01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:36.060
I had seen for myself that the worshiped the true God, Jehovah.

01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:45.989
Did you notice how the young man recognized and put faith in Jehovah's organization?

01:14:45.989 --> 01:14:51.989
That was a protection, so he wasn't misled by lies from our enemies.

01:14:51.989 --> 01:14:54.989
His faith might have reminded you of the Phoenician woman.

01:14:54.989 --> 01:15:01.989
Remember, she recognized and put faith in Jehovah's representative, his son.

01:15:02.989 --> 01:15:09.989
The question we need to consider is, how can we imitate the Phoenician woman's strong faith?

01:15:09.989 --> 01:15:16.989
Like that woman, we need to recognize Jehovah's representatives and associate with them.

01:15:16.989 --> 01:15:21.989
At Matthew 24.45, Jesus identified these representatives.

01:15:21.989 --> 01:15:25.989
He foretold that in our day, he would use the faithful and discreet slave

01:15:25.989 --> 01:15:28.989
to provide spiritual food at the proper time.

01:15:29.989 --> 01:15:35.989
Why can we have strong faith that the governing body is filling that role of the faithful and discreet slave?

01:15:35.989 --> 01:15:38.989
Consider three lines of evidence.

01:15:38.989 --> 01:15:43.989
First, there's evidence of Holy Spirit guiding these brothers.

01:15:43.989 --> 01:15:50.989
For example, Holy Spirit has helped the governing body to grasp scriptural truths not previously understood.

01:15:50.989 --> 01:15:55.989
These brothers feel as the Apostle Paul, who wrote at 1 Corinthians 2.13,

01:15:55.989 --> 01:16:04.989
these things we also speak, not with words taught by human wisdom, but with those taught by the Spirit.

01:16:04.989 --> 01:16:08.989
Second, we see evidence of angelic assistance.

01:16:08.989 --> 01:16:17.989
The governing body has the immense task of overseeing an international preaching work involving over 8 million evangelizers.

01:16:17.989 --> 01:16:27.989
The overall growth of the preaching and disciple-making work, despite fierce opposition in some lands, has been possible only with superhuman assistance.

01:16:27.989 --> 01:16:34.300
A third line of evidence is Reliance on God's Word.

01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:40.300
Some religions may revise teachings in order to appease beliefs and opinions of their members,

01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:48.300
but our dear brothers of the governing body allow their decisions to be guided by God's Word rather than popular opinion.

01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:55.300
We can have strong faith that Jehovah, through his son, is directing the governing body.

01:16:55.300 --> 01:17:04.300
And we need to remain loyal to these faithful brothers and to Jehovah's organization, despite attempts by opposers to discredit them.

01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:07.300
What will be the outcome if we do?

01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:10.300
Think back to the example of the Phoenician woman.

01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:13.300
Was she rewarded for her strong faith?

01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:17.300
Yes, when her beloved daughter was healed.

01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:26.300
Likewise, if you display strong faith and follow the direction of our leader, Jesus, he will lead you to everlasting life.

01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:32.970
Where the William Malan font, a helper to the teaching committee, will now present the next talk of this symposium.

01:17:32.970 --> 01:17:36.970
Imitate women of strong faith, Martha.

01:17:36.970 --> 01:17:47.489
Martha, Martha.

01:17:47.489 --> 01:17:51.489
She was a hard-working, hospitable woman.

01:17:52.489 --> 01:18:01.489
The Bible tells us that Jesus loved Martha and her sister Mary and their brother Lazarus.

01:18:01.489 --> 01:18:09.489
When Lazarus took ill, Martha surely did everything in her power to soothe his discomfort.

01:18:09.489 --> 01:18:21.489
She was so concerned with her brother's condition that she and her sister Mary sent a message to Jesus as recorded at John 113, saying,

01:18:21.489 --> 01:18:28.489
Lord, see, the one for whom you have affection is sick.

01:18:28.489 --> 01:18:32.489
Martha knew that Lazarus was seriously ill.

01:18:32.489 --> 01:18:39.489
She must have felt helpless as Lazarus sank deeper into his illness and then died.

01:18:39.489 --> 01:18:42.489
What would Martha do?

01:18:42.489 --> 01:18:50.489
Would she give into despair and would grief overpower her and weaken her faith?

01:18:50.489 --> 01:19:00.340
As you watch the following video, try to imagine Martha's grief when her brother died.

01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:04.340
During those first few days, everything was a blur.

01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:09.340
My sister Mary and I had never felt so empty and lost.

01:19:09.340 --> 01:19:16.340
I knew that if our Lord had been here, our brother would not have died.

01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:24.340
But through the tears and the pain, I had no doubt that the resurrection was real.

01:19:24.340 --> 01:19:28.340
But someday, someday he would live again.

01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:33.619
Who could have imagined it could happen that very day?

01:19:33.619 --> 01:19:47.140
And right before our eyes, we wept here's joy and thanked our loving father in heaven, Jehovah.

01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:55.140
Empathy helps us to feel the pain and the distress that Martha felt when Lazarus died.

01:19:55.140 --> 01:20:00.140
The Bible account tells us that Jesus traveled to Bethany where Martha lived.

01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:04.140
But he did not arrive before Lazarus died.

01:20:04.140 --> 01:20:09.140
In fact, he came four days after Lazarus had died.

01:20:09.140 --> 01:20:16.140
When Jesus met with Martha, she expressed faith that Jesus could have healed Lazarus.

01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:21.140
And she felt that Jesus might yet help her brother.

01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:28.140
The scriptures show that she also believed in the future resurrection.

01:20:28.140 --> 01:20:33.140
Martha must have been thinking about miracles that Jesus had performed

01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:36.140
and the people who had been healed by him.

01:20:36.140 --> 01:20:44.140
And she had no doubt that Jesus was the Christ and that he could perform miracles.

01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:50.140
Read with me what the Bible says about Martha's faith in the resurrection

01:20:50.140 --> 01:20:53.140
and her confidence in Jesus.

01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:58.140
It's found at John chapter 11 verses 21 through 26.

01:20:58.140 --> 01:21:00.140
It reads as follows.

01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:04.489
Martha then said to Jesus,

01:21:04.489 --> 01:21:10.489
Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.

01:21:10.489 --> 01:21:15.489
She didn't say this to reproach Jesus. She merely stated a fact.

01:21:15.489 --> 01:21:22.489
And then she goes on. She says, yet even now I know that whatever you ask God for,

01:21:22.489 --> 01:21:25.489
God will give you.

01:21:25.489 --> 01:21:27.489
Jesus said to her,

01:21:27.489 --> 01:21:30.489
Your brother will rise.

01:21:30.489 --> 01:21:32.489
Martha said to him,

01:21:32.489 --> 01:21:36.489
I know he will rise in the resurrection on the last day.

01:21:36.489 --> 01:21:39.489
Jesus said to her,

01:21:39.489 --> 01:21:42.489
I am the resurrection and the life.

01:21:42.489 --> 01:21:48.489
The one who exercises faith in me, even though he dies, will come to life.

01:21:48.489 --> 01:21:55.489
And everyone who is living in exercises faith in me will never die at all.

01:21:55.489 --> 01:21:58.489
Do you believe this?

01:21:58.489 --> 01:22:06.489
In verse 27, Martha makes one of the most important statements that would ever pass her lips.

01:22:06.489 --> 01:22:08.489
It reads,

01:22:08.489 --> 01:22:10.489
She said to him,

01:22:10.489 --> 01:22:20.489
Yes, Lord, I have believed that you are the Christ, the Son of God, the One coming into the world.

01:22:20.489 --> 01:22:27.489
We can only imagine how much her faith was appreciated by Jesus.

01:22:27.489 --> 01:22:36.489
Jesus Christ has the same appreciation for us as we show our faith in His promises.

01:22:36.489 --> 01:22:39.489
In the following dramatization,

01:22:39.489 --> 01:23:09.899
observe how a sister's faith brings her comfort.

01:23:09.899 --> 01:23:22.229
I lost my son.

01:23:22.229 --> 01:23:26.380
I lost part of myself.

01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:36.659
I tried to stay busy,

01:23:36.659 --> 01:23:42.569
but everything felt empty.

01:23:42.569 --> 01:24:12.789
In my darkest times,

01:24:12.789 --> 01:24:15.789
Jehovah's words brought me comfort.

01:24:15.789 --> 01:24:51.210
Not a day goes by that I don't think about Brandon.

01:24:51.210 --> 01:24:58.300
Not just memories of how it was.

01:24:58.300 --> 01:25:07.619
But even more, how wonderful it will be to see him soon in God's new world.

01:25:07.619 --> 01:25:17.380
We deeply sympathize with the sister in the video over the loss of her son,

01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:23.380
and with any in the congregation that have suffered the loss of a loved one.

01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:28.380
Did you take note of how the sister imitated Martha's faith

01:25:28.380 --> 01:25:36.380
by putting her complete trust in Jehovah God and going to Him in prayer?

01:25:36.380 --> 01:25:41.380
Like Martha, we can build our faith in the resurrection

01:25:41.380 --> 01:25:46.380
by carefully considering all that God's Word says about it.

01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:53.380
Think of all the evidence there is that Jesus was resurrected.

01:25:53.380 --> 01:25:58.380
The scriptures show clearly that after His death and resurrection,

01:25:58.380 --> 01:26:03.380
Jesus showed Himself alive to His disciples.

01:26:03.380 --> 01:26:08.380
He also appeared to Saul of Tarsus who became the Apostle Paul.

01:26:08.380 --> 01:26:11.380
In His letter to the Corinthians,

01:26:11.380 --> 01:26:17.380
Paul points out that more than 500 brothers saw the resurrected Jesus.

01:26:17.380 --> 01:26:21.380
And to show that it was not just hearsay,

01:26:21.380 --> 01:26:26.380
Paul tells us that most of those eyewitnesses were still alive

01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:29.380
when he wrote to the Corinthians.

01:26:29.380 --> 01:26:39.380
Yes, they were living witnesses who could verify the fact that Jesus was resurrected from the dead.

01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:47.380
And think about the inspired assurance that we have at Revelation 21, 3 and 4,

01:26:47.380 --> 01:26:53.380
that the time is coming when death will be no more.

01:26:53.380 --> 01:27:02.380
When you think about it, who is it that declares that death will be no more at Revelation 21, 3 and 4?

01:27:02.380 --> 01:27:07.380
None other than the resurrected Jesus Christ.

01:27:07.380 --> 01:27:15.380
We do well to imitate Martha by maintaining strong faith when we face the loss of a loved one.

01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:19.380
No, it's not easy. It's painful.

01:27:19.380 --> 01:27:27.380
But we can do it knowing full well that this life is not all there is.

01:27:27.380 --> 01:27:33.380
All true Christians must have faith in the resurrection.

01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:42.380
Faith that the dead will live again and that death will be done away with in God's new world.

01:27:43.380 --> 01:27:50.380
Jehovah and his son rewarded the faith of Martha, Mary and Lazarus.

01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:57.380
We will be rewarded too if we build strong faith like that of Martha.

01:27:57.380 --> 01:28:06.630
Brother Garrett Lush, a member of the governing body will now present the final talk of this symposium.

01:28:07.630 --> 01:28:13.630
Imitate women of strong faith, modern-day examples.

01:28:13.630 --> 01:28:27.220
Over the years, there were many sisters without standing faith.

01:28:27.220 --> 01:28:31.220
Sister Matsui Ishi was one of them.

01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:35.220
She was born in Japan in 1909.

01:28:35.220 --> 01:28:41.220
Although she grew up in the Buddhist family, she had a thirst for Bible knowledge.

01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:49.220
In 1918, the Spanish flu hit her area and she saw lots of coffins with dead bodies.

01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:57.220
She and her elders sister both also caught the Spanish flu and the week later her sister died.

01:28:57.220 --> 01:29:04.220
She wondered, why do people die and what happens to them at death?

01:29:04.220 --> 01:29:15.220
In 1928, when Matsui was 19, her father arranged for her to marry Jesus Ishi a jealous Buddhist.

01:29:15.220 --> 01:29:22.220
Matsui was introduced to the truth in Osaka through the book The Heart of God.

01:29:22.220 --> 01:29:31.220
That was given to her by a brother who lived in a neighboring house that belonged to the International Bible Students Association.

01:29:31.220 --> 01:29:40.220
Matsui was baptized in March 1929 and her husband, Giso, was baptized a short time later.

01:29:40.220 --> 01:29:50.220
In June 1939, when she was 30 years old, she and her husband were arrested and were separated from each other.

01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:54.220
This certainly called for faith.

01:29:54.220 --> 01:30:01.220
She said that she nearly died when she was in solitary confinement for almost a year.

01:30:01.220 --> 01:30:11.220
Matsui was released toward the end of 1944 and she was reunited with Giso after World War II ended.

01:30:11.220 --> 01:30:18.039
Both she and her husband had remained faithful.

01:30:18.039 --> 01:30:22.039
Let us now consider another encouraging example.

01:30:22.039 --> 01:30:29.039
Right after World War II ended, far away from Japan in Estonia, Northeastern Europe,

01:30:29.039 --> 01:30:40.039
Ella Tom was introduced to the truth in April 1945 and was baptized in August 1946 at age 20.

01:30:40.039 --> 01:30:49.039
She was arrested by the Communists on December 27, 1950 and sentenced to imprisonment.

01:30:49.039 --> 01:30:57.039
She was sent to a slave labor camp in Russia, the infamous Wakuta camp, above the Arctic Circle,

01:30:57.039 --> 01:31:05.039
and later to other prison camps, 250 miles of 400 kilometers southeast of Moscow.

01:31:05.039 --> 01:31:09.039
The sisters continued to be spiritually minded.

01:31:09.039 --> 01:31:17.039
They made miniature copies of watchtower and put them inside bars of soap and resealed the soap.

01:31:17.039 --> 01:31:20.039
This certainly called for faith.

01:31:20.039 --> 01:31:30.039
She did not have to serve for 13 years but actually was released on May 4, 1956, after five and a half years.

01:31:30.039 --> 01:31:34.039
The year after, she married Brother Lempid Tom.

01:31:34.039 --> 01:31:45.699
However, the threat of searches and arrests continued until the preaching work was legalized in Estonia in 1991.

01:31:45.699 --> 01:32:06.020
In the following video, note some other details regarding the lives of these two faithful women, Matsui Ishi and Ella Tom.

01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:16.020
For nearly a year, I had been held in solitary confinement in a tiny filthy, bug-infested prison cell.

01:32:16.020 --> 01:32:28.560
Five and a half years after my arrest, I was released.

01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:36.560
If we truly rely on Jehovah, really love him and cry out in a heart for his help,

01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:56.260
just as he did not forsake me, he will not forsake his servants.

01:32:56.260 --> 01:33:00.260
They arrested me and took me in for questioning.

01:33:00.260 --> 01:33:08.149
An interrogator invited me to sign a document stating that I would discontinue preaching.

01:33:08.149 --> 01:33:18.779
I said, I would rather live in prison with my relationship with God intact than be free and lose his approval.

01:33:18.779 --> 01:33:23.779
My determination has been to heed the Bible admonition.

01:33:23.779 --> 01:33:27.779
Trust in Jehovah and do good.

01:33:27.779 --> 01:33:40.500
I have learned that doing this leads to receiving the requests of your heart.

01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:46.500
How did the sisters Ishi and Tom show faith?

01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:50.500
This turned with me to Psalm 37.

01:33:50.500 --> 01:34:00.500
Sister Ishi had faith that Jehovah would not abandon her in line with Psalm 37, 25, which reads,

01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:12.159
I was once young and now I'm old, but I have not seen anyone righteous abandoned nor his children looking for bread.

01:34:12.159 --> 01:34:18.159
Her faith had her to endure difficult tests of integrity.

01:34:18.159 --> 01:34:31.159
She was arrested on June 21, 1939 and taken to a police station and put into a dark cell with suit hanging from the ceiling.

01:34:31.159 --> 01:34:38.159
The after she was transferred to another location and put into solitary confinement.

01:34:38.159 --> 01:34:46.159
Her husband was also arrested and she did not see him until the war had ended.

01:34:46.159 --> 01:34:54.159
I nearly died in that cell, she said, but she was exposed to another test too.

01:34:54.159 --> 01:35:06.159
When interrogated, she found out from the officials that Junso Akashi, the overseer of the Japan branch, had abandoned the truth.

01:35:06.159 --> 01:35:12.159
Sister Ishi replied, Akashi is only an imperfect human.

01:35:12.159 --> 01:35:20.500
He is no longer my brother. Sister Ishi remained loyal.

01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:27.500
Similarly, Sister Tom from Estonia refused to compromise or to abandon her faith.

01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:44.680
She prayed and meditated on Bible principles in order to endure like Psalm 119 verses 97 and 98 say,

01:35:44.680 --> 01:35:50.680
How I do love your law, I ponder over it all day long.

01:35:50.680 --> 01:36:00.659
Your commandment makes me wiser than my enemies because it is with me forever.

01:36:00.659 --> 01:36:09.659
In 1949, Ella Tom was arrested by the communists. They took her in for questioning.

01:36:09.659 --> 01:36:19.659
She reports, forced to remove all my clothing and being watched by young police officers, I felt humiliated.

01:36:19.659 --> 01:36:28.199
Yet after I prayed to Jehovah, peace and calmness of heart came over me.

01:36:28.199 --> 01:36:33.199
Next I was put in a tiny cell where I could not even lie down.

01:36:33.199 --> 01:36:38.199
I was taken out only for interrogations.

01:36:38.199 --> 01:36:43.199
Officers would say, we are not asking you to deny the existence of God.

01:36:43.199 --> 01:36:49.199
Just stop your stupid preaching. You can have a promising future.

01:36:49.199 --> 01:37:00.930
And they would threaten, quote, Do you want to live or do you want to die with your God on the fields of Siberia?

01:37:00.930 --> 01:37:08.930
She said, For three days I was prevented from falling asleep between the repeated interrogations.

01:37:08.930 --> 01:37:13.930
Meditation on Bible principles helped me to endure.

01:37:13.930 --> 01:37:23.930
Finally an interrogator invited me to sign a document stating that I would discontinue preaching.

01:37:23.930 --> 01:37:27.930
I have given this matter much thought, I said.

01:37:27.930 --> 01:37:38.369
And I would rather live in prison with my relationship with God intact than to be free and lose his approval.

01:37:38.369 --> 01:37:43.369
At that interrogators shouted, You fool.

01:37:43.369 --> 01:37:48.369
All of you will be arrested and sent to Siberia.

01:37:48.369 --> 01:37:53.369
But she was unexpectedly set free at midnight.

01:37:53.369 --> 01:37:57.369
However, was arrested again some time later.

01:37:57.369 --> 01:38:05.369
In the following dramatization, note how a brother shows faith like that of sister's issue and tomb.

01:38:05.369 --> 01:38:24.010
As the world went from bad to worse, I dug deeper into God's word.

01:38:24.010 --> 01:38:44.939
I wanted to stay strong like so many brothers and sisters in the past.

01:38:44.939 --> 01:38:53.380
Those who remain faithful had no special abilities and were inconspicuous.

01:38:53.380 --> 01:39:00.380
Surely all of us must always trust in Jehovah with all our heart.

01:39:00.380 --> 01:39:05.529
I memorized scriptures.

01:39:05.529 --> 01:39:38.930
I knew these words would build my faith and give me the strength I needed to face what was to come.

01:39:38.930 --> 01:39:45.930
To code this week, as local authorities enforce new restrictions on Jehovah's Witnesses, this is coming just 14 days after this.

01:39:45.930 --> 01:40:12.229
Trust in Jehovah and do what is good.

01:40:12.229 --> 01:40:16.229
Reside in the earth and act with faithfulness.

01:40:16.229 --> 01:40:22.229
Find exquisite delight in Jehovah and you will grant you the desires of your heart.

01:40:22.229 --> 01:40:30.340
We had to be more discreet, but we never stopped talking about God's word.

01:40:30.340 --> 01:40:44.399
We had to face many difficulties, but with God's word embedded in our hearts, we faithfully endured to the end.

01:40:44.399 --> 01:40:55.649
How can you imitate the examples discussed in this symposium?

01:40:55.649 --> 01:40:58.649
How can you imitate Sarah?

01:40:58.649 --> 01:41:06.649
Build faith by meditating on Jehovah's goodness to his people and to you personally.

01:41:06.649 --> 01:41:09.649
How can you imitate Rahab?

01:41:09.649 --> 01:41:16.649
Take a firm stand for true worship, even if you have only a limited knowledge of the truth.

01:41:16.649 --> 01:41:21.500
How to imitate Hannah?

01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:29.039
Build faith by taking note of Jehovah's answers to your prayers.

01:41:29.039 --> 01:41:34.039
How can you imitate the captive Israelite girl?

01:41:34.039 --> 01:41:44.039
Young ones show faith by sharing the good news with schoolmates, teachers, and unbelieving family members.

01:41:44.039 --> 01:41:48.039
You can also imitate the mother of Jesus, Mary.

01:41:48.039 --> 01:41:49.039
How?

01:41:49.039 --> 01:41:54.039
Strengthen your faith and trust in Jehovah.

01:41:54.039 --> 01:42:00.930
Carefully examine the scriptures and meditate on them.

01:42:00.930 --> 01:42:03.930
How can you imitate the Phoenician woman?

01:42:03.930 --> 01:42:12.210
Recognize whom Jehovah is using to do his will and associate yourself with them?

01:42:12.210 --> 01:42:17.210
How can you imitate Mary, the sister of Lazarus?

01:42:17.210 --> 01:42:24.210
Build faith by considering all that God's word says about His wonderful promises.

01:42:24.210 --> 01:42:32.210
The Bible says, Mary, set down at the feet of the Lord and kept listening to what He was saying.

01:42:32.210 --> 01:42:39.260
How can you imitate sister's ishi and the tomb?

01:42:39.260 --> 01:42:46.260
Let the power of God's word motivate you to endure faithfully.

01:42:46.260 --> 01:42:52.260
When we clearly perceive the great cloud of witnesses surrounding us,

01:42:52.260 --> 01:42:58.260
we can run with endurance the race that is set before us as Hebrews 12.

01:42:58.260 --> 01:43:02.260
Verse 1 encourages us to do.

01:43:02.260 --> 01:43:08.260
Like these faithful women, we can all be included in Jehovah's book of remembrance,

01:43:08.260 --> 01:43:16.260
as mentioned at Malachi 3.16 and inherit everlasting blessings.

01:43:16.260 --> 01:43:21.819
Thank you, brothers, for those motivating talks.

01:43:21.819 --> 01:43:29.069
May we always cherish faithful women just as Jehovah does.

01:43:29.069 --> 01:43:35.069
Let's sing together, song number 142, holding fast to our hope.

01:43:35.069 --> 01:43:41.069
Again, that's song number 142.
