WEBVTT

00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:06.169
After the flood, Jehovah stated as recorded in Genesis 8.21,

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:10.669
the inclination of the heart of man is bad from his youth up.

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:15.169
So sadly, we all have imperfect tendencies,

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:19.570
and Satan's banking on us, acting on those inclinations.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.769
For example, our text comments today highlight

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:25.469
that Job needed to work on humility.

00:00:25.469 --> 00:00:28.170
And if we researched Job, we learned that he had other areas

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.769
he could improve on too.

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.170
For example, when attacked, he became bitter and discouraged.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.570
Now, it's understandable any of us would in that circumstance,

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.030
but understandable doesn't mean good,

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.270
because those reaction or imperfect tendencies

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.369
blinded Job from considering other possible reasons

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:53.369
for his problem, and then he blamed and criticized Jehovah.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.969
Now, when we listen to that description,

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:57.170
it sounds rather bleak.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.770
He needed to work on humility, avoid bitterness,

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.469
avoid discouragement, avoid justification,

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:06.769
not be critical, and shift blame.

00:01:06.769 --> 00:01:09.569
We probably all have a little bit of Job in us,

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:11.769
things that we can work on.

00:01:11.769 --> 00:01:15.170
Satan hoped that those tendencies would win

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.370
and break Job's integrity.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.569
But did Jehovah see Job like that

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:22.469
or any of the rest of us like that?

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:23.769
Not even close.

00:01:23.769 --> 00:01:25.769
Let's go back to the beginning of this trial

00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:27.370
and see Jehovah's viewpoint.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.969
I invite you to Job, chapter one.

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:32.769
Job, chapter one, and we'll read verse eight.

00:01:32.769 --> 00:01:34.170
Job one, verse eight.

00:01:35.769 --> 00:01:38.170
The heavenly scene, Satan has been allowed

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.269
to enter in before Jehovah,

00:01:40.269 --> 00:01:42.170
and notice the conversation in verse eight.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.569
And Jehovah said to Satan,

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:48.769
have you taken note of my servant, Job?

00:01:48.769 --> 00:01:50.969
There is no one like him on the earth.

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:52.870
He is an upright man of integrity,

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.269
fearing God and shunning, what is bad?

00:01:56.269 --> 00:01:59.170
Now what a fantastic evaluation.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.670
Why the difference?

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.569
And what can we learn that will help us weather trials today?

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:07.670
Let's look at a first lesson.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.169
Relationships matter.

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:14.169
Relationships with Jehovah and our fellow servants.

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:16.169
Let's first talk about Jehovah.

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:19.569
Satan obviously hated Job.

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.069
Satan only saw value in Job

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.469
if he could break his integrity.

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:25.169
Other than that, he was worthless dust.

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:28.870
Whereas Job and Jehovah had a personal relationship.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.669
Job didn't understand why he was suffering,

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:35.169
but regardless, he loved Jehovah

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:37.870
and he didn't want to break his integrity.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.469
And Jehovah knew Job.

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:43.270
Jehovah saw Job's faithfulness and love for his family.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.669
He also remembered that Job didn't worship the sun,

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:49.370
the moon, and the heavenly body, so common at that time.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.370
He also helped fatherless boys and widows

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.870
and he was kind to his servants.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.169
Job also knew that Job didn't want to break his integrity.

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:00.169
Thus, while Jehovah was not ignorant

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:02.870
of Job's imperfect inclinations,

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.270
he didn't view Job as the sum of his weaknesses.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.870
Jehovah saw the whole man and focused on his good qualities.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.069
And Jehovah does the same with us today.

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.069
Why?

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.770
Because we have a personal relationship based on love.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.370
Now at times, it's true,

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.770
we may want Jehovah to correct something

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.969
or provide direction more quickly

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:27.870
or we might not like the direction

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.169
or we don't understand why Jehovah's allowing a situation.

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:33.770
But because of our relationship,

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.669
we're patient and confident.

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:39.469
We know Jehovah will care for things

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:41.569
and that our obedience will be blessed,

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:42.870
just like Job's was.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.569
We also need personal relationships

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.569
with our fellow workers to get through trials.

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.569
For example, Jehovah's Holy Spirit empowered a lie

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.270
who to help Job.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.270
A lie who was younger had less experience.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.969
But Job accepted his counsel.

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:01.270
He needed the help.

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.669
One reference mentioned that Job

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:05.169
may even have wept in relief

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:09.469
as a lie who helped him firmly but kindly.

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:12.069
Today, our brothers and sisters want to help.

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:13.669
But here's the catch.

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:16.069
We have to be willing to accept their help.

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:19.269
Be it spiritual, physical, or emotional.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.470
We don't want to dismiss their help

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.970
because we see their imperfect tendencies

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.970
or because we don't want to be a burden.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.269
Our brothers and sisters care for us.

00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:33.069
And these relationships will be even more important

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:34.970
as we near the end.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.569
To weather trials, relationships matter,

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:41.170
both with Jehovah and our brothers and sisters.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.170
Let's look at a second lesson.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.370
We want to have the correct viewpoint of trials.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.670
We remember that Job didn't cause,

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.170
Jehovah didn't cause Job's troubles.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.769
But he didn't stop them either.

00:04:53.769 --> 00:04:57.569
Job was allowed to suffer, but with a purpose.

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:02.370
First and foremost, to prove his integrity and Satan a liar.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.170
But secondarily, the trial also afforded Jehovah

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:09.069
an opportunity to train Job further.

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:11.069
And it's similar today.

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:13.470
Satan hasn't gotten any nicer with age.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.269
So while we don't look for trials,

00:05:16.269 --> 00:05:18.269
we're not surprised when they come

00:05:18.269 --> 00:05:21.569
and we don't end them via unscriptural means.

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:22.670
Why?

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:23.870
Our viewpoint.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.769
We view trials as an honor and as an opportunity.

00:05:28.769 --> 00:05:31.269
Imagine for a moment how Job would have felt

00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:33.870
if when Satan made his taunt to Jehovah.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.269
Jehovah told Satan, you know, Job's good.

00:05:38.269 --> 00:05:40.170
But he still needs to work on a few things.

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:41.569
He's not ready.

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:45.170
Let's wait until Moses comes along.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:46.269
But that didn't happen.

00:05:46.269 --> 00:05:47.670
Look back at verse 8.

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.470
Notice, it wasn't Satan who brought up Job's name.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.769
Yes, he was thinking about it.

00:05:53.769 --> 00:05:56.769
But it was Jehovah who brought up Job's name

00:05:56.769 --> 00:06:00.069
and then gave that wonderful description that we read.

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:03.769
Job was honored to stand up for Jehovah.

00:06:03.769 --> 00:06:05.069
And we are too.

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:08.769
We want Jehovah to use our name

00:06:08.769 --> 00:06:11.670
just like he did Job's.

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.370
We also view standing firm through trials

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:15.769
as an opportunity.

00:06:15.769 --> 00:06:18.170
I'd like to invite you to the first letter that Peter wrote.

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.069
First Peter.

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:22.170
We'll look at chapter 5 and verse 10.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:27.089
Verse Peter 5 and verse 10.

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:29.889
Notice what it says.

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.990
But after you have suffered a little while,

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.790
so a trial, there will be trials.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.790
The God of all undeserved kindness

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:38.790
who called you to his everlasting glory

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:39.889
and union with Christ.

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:44.490
Now notice, we'll himself finish your training.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.389
In the result, he will make you firm.

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:49.189
He will make you strong.

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:52.389
He will firmly ground you.

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:55.290
So while Jehovah didn't cause Job's trial,

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.990
it did become a teaching moment.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:02.689
Jehovah helped Job see the bigger picture and be humbler.

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:04.389
And Jehovah can train us today too.

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:07.689
So if we're facing a trial, we should ask ourselves,

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:10.589
what is Jehovah teaching me?

00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:14.490
Do I need more faith to be milder to work on humility?

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:19.589
And whatever we need, we let Jehovah train us.

00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:21.290
I was recently speaking with the sister

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:24.089
who's been going through a very challenging situation

00:07:24.089 --> 00:07:25.389
for a while now.

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:26.389
But as she was explaining it,

00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:28.089
she made a beautiful comment.

00:07:28.089 --> 00:07:31.290
She said that while she never expected to go through this

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:33.589
and hopes never to go through it again,

00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:35.889
she has come to see how Jehovah

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:38.290
is truly caring for her.

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.290
She stated that she has seen Jehovah's hand

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.389
on her behalf personally in ways

00:07:42.389 --> 00:07:46.089
that she has never experienced before.

00:07:46.089 --> 00:07:48.290
It's built her faith.

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:51.689
So a trial can be an opportunity for Jehovah

00:07:51.689 --> 00:07:54.990
to train us and make us firm.

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:58.689
We will face a myriad of trials as this system ends

00:07:58.689 --> 00:08:01.990
and Satan counts on our weaknesses.

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:03.790
But as Jehovah's servants,

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:05.889
we will weather the storm.

00:08:05.889 --> 00:08:07.790
To get through these trials,

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:09.089
we will need to remember

00:08:09.089 --> 00:08:12.189
that we need strong relationship with Jehovah

00:08:12.189 --> 00:08:13.790
and our brothers and sisters.

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:16.189
No one's an island.

00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:17.889
Relationships matter.

00:08:17.889 --> 00:08:21.790
And secondly, we adopt the right view of that trial.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:23.889
We see it as an honor to give an answer

00:08:23.889 --> 00:08:25.990
to Jehovah for Satan's taunt

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:29.990
and it's an opportunity for Jehovah to finish our training.
