00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:07.860
The text and comment in today's examining the scripture's daily was taken from a Watchtower study article with the theme

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.220
How can we maintain a waiting attitude?

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:16.620
That's a timely question for all of us to ponder because as that Watchtower said

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.100
impatience can be dangerous

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.140
For it can cause us to behave rashly

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.579
What's the antidote to impatience?

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:32.219
Open please your Bible to the theme text for that Watchtower study in Micah chapter 7 and verse 7

00:00:33.179 --> 00:00:42.939
Let's read Micah 7 7 together and consider for a few moments how Micah's good example can help us to maintain a waiting attitude

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.140
That text reads

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.140
But as for me, I will keep on the lookout for Jehovah

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:57.899
I will show a waiting attitude or as the footnote says I will wait patiently for the God of my salvation

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.380
My God will hear me

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.739
It's beautiful that in just that one verse three times Micah refers to his God our God Jehovah

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.900
And that's a nice reminder that no matter what the situation is that may cause us to have feelings of impatience

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:15.659
frustration

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.700
Whenever we put a problem or a difficulty side-by-side with our God

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.579
Jehovah what happens to the situation?

00:01:24.379 --> 00:01:26.060
It appears smaller

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.060
manageable with his help

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:34.939
We might conclude as did Brother Carl Klein as published in his life story that if Jehovah permits it

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.500
We can take it

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:41.900
With Jehovah's help we can patiently endure any trial

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.620
circumstance situation as long as necessary without losing our joy

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:51.739
Micah was confident of that

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.219
Look again at chapter 7 and verse 7

00:01:55.019 --> 00:01:58.299
By saying that he would keep on the lookout for Jehovah

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:06.219
In effect, Micah was saying that he was determined to become like an active century on a Watchtower

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.699
So let's try to picture that a wide-eyed

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.580
Watchman on high alert

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.259
That was Micah spiritually speaking

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.580
He was determined not to get impatient not to get frustrated with things that he could not change

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.580
Was it easy for Micah to maintain a waiting attitude?

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:30.060
Probably not

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:37.419
Notice the context that reveals what circumstances were like in Israel in Judah in Micah's time

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:43.500
Notice is you consider some of the thoughts there beginning in verse 2 of Micah chapter 7

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.979
He says the loyal one has perished from the earth

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.939
Verse 3 their hands are expert at doing what is bad

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.180
Verse 4

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:57.259
Their best one is like thorns

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.340
Their most upright one is worse than a thorn hedge

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:07.340
In fact in verse 5 he says do not put your faith in your companion or trust a close friend

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.379
Guard what you say to the one who lies in your embrace

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.379
Verse 6 for a son despises his father

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:19.419
A daughter rises up against her mother and a daughter in law is against her mother in law

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:23.180
A man's enemies are the men of his own household

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:30.139
Yes, times were difficult when Micah was alive during wicked King Ahaz's rule

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:35.099
The spiritual and moral conditions in Israel deteriorated to an appalling state

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:39.180
Can you relate to Micah's circumstances?

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:47.180
All of Jehovah's people today experience a test of endurance a test of patience because we're living in a selfish world

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.539
Where according to the scriptures people are unthankful

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.340
disloyal they have no natural affection

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:57.180
True Christians are objects of hatred as Jesus foretold

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:01.580
Some of our brothers and sisters experience hatred

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:06.060
Opposition at school and at work nearly every day

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.500
Sometimes that hatred is within the family from unbelieving family members

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.860
Think too about the hatred that our brothers and sisters are experienced to our

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.180
Imprisoned

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:25.420
I can't help but think about the two sisters and Isaac by John that we're praying fervently for

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:32.139
Because of their unjust persecution or 600 more in Eritrea

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.139
Nagorno-Karaba

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.620
Singapore South Korea and Turkmenistan

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:44.779
Those are injustices that we long to see corrected. We'd love to see those situations change today

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.180
But are we impatient?

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.379
No, we cultivate a waiting attitude

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:56.139
Added to these circumstances are the health problems that many of our brothers and sisters are facing

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.220
These two are tests of patience tests of endurance

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:08.540
Maybe you're dealing with a health challenge or a family member or friend of yours is battling one of these to a greater or lesser degree

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:15.019
It may be think of the broadcast for this month for December where we met Sabina Hernandez in Panama

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:21.980
Who was born with a severe handicap since birth her life has been anything but normal

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:25.180
But what an encouragement she is

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:30.779
She's come to trust in Jehovah like Micah. She's developed a waiting attitude and this sister

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.259
Is doing her best to serve Jehovah despite her health challenge

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:40.779
She looks forward to the day when those circumstances will change and we do too

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:43.259
We'd love to see it today, wouldn't we?

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.100
Of course those problems will end and likely it will happen sooner than we think

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:56.220
But whether the end of our circumstances that are so difficult comes today or a little later

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.500
What can Micah's example teach us?

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.220
We'll think a little deeper about Micah

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.660
Micah served faithfully for some six decades some 60 years

00:06:08.459 --> 00:06:12.060
He did live to see the fulfillment of some of Jehovah's judgment messages

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.819
He did see some good footage from his prophesying activity

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:19.980
But did Micah live to see the fulfillment of all of Jehovah's promises?

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.379
No

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:27.259
So what helped him to wait patiently to keep active to be confident in Jehovah

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:33.420
It was his absolute confidence that Jehovah would in time fulfill all of his promises

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.060
He trusted completely in him

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:41.339
Well by way of a reminder what two practical steps could we do

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.620
Or do more fully that will help us to cultivate that same trusting

00:06:47.019 --> 00:06:49.019
Confident waiting attitude

00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:54.300
The first is the text found at first Thessalonians chapter 5 and verse 17

00:06:55.259 --> 00:06:59.339
Let's read that together first Thessalonians chapter 5 and verse 17

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.259
Perhaps you haven't memorized. It's one of the easiest verses to do that

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.339
two words

00:07:05.339 --> 00:07:07.339
What does it tell us to do?

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.420
Pray constantly

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:14.139
We need to remember that prayer is real communication with God

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.819
We can never be charged with talking too much to Jehovah

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:24.060
When it comes to real communication with God the watchtower cited this text and said

00:07:24.459 --> 00:07:28.139
He's willing to listen endlessly to those who do his will

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:33.019
Let's accept that invitation. Let's pray constantly about the things that distress us

00:07:33.259 --> 00:07:38.779
Let's cultivate the trust in him by praying specifically about the things that we need help with

00:07:39.899 --> 00:07:46.300
But what if we pray constantly and we're enduring a situation and the problem persists what then

00:07:47.579 --> 00:07:49.579
Notice Luke 11 verse 9, please

00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:53.759
Jesus words

00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:57.199
Give us every reason for confidence when it says at Luke 11 9

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.759
So I say to you keep on asking and it will be given you

00:08:02.319 --> 00:08:07.279
Keep on seeking and you will find keep on knocking and it will be open to you

00:08:08.399 --> 00:08:12.959
Yes, we want to do what's with ever in our power to solve our problems

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:19.199
Having confidence that in time Jehovah will give us the solution and until then he'll help us endure

00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:23.360
Remember what happens to a mountain when it's put next to Jehovah

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.240
It becomes a molehill

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:33.039
We need to turn mountains into mole hills by throwing our concerns upon Jehovah in prayer

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.600
Micah's confidence was not misplaced

00:08:36.399 --> 00:08:43.840
Soon he'll be back with us in the resurrection to witness the fulfillment of all of Jehovah's promises that he patiently waited for

00:08:44.559 --> 00:08:51.840
So like him may we curb our natural feelings of impatience by keeping wide awake in faith always on the lookout for Jehovah
