00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:09.970
The islands of Micronesia are tiny specks in the Pacific Ocean, but these beautiful islands are home to some

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.210
1,400 worshipers of Jehovah.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:21.929
Formerly called the Guam branch, the Micronesia branch oversees the work in nine lands in addition to Guam.

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:30.809
There are currently 64 Bethel family members in full-time commuters, but only 25 are at the branch office.

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:36.490
The rest have the privilege of working in six remote translation offices.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.609
A significant milestone was recently reached in Micronesia.

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:49.250
The Kingdom Hall construction program that began in 2008 will be complete this month.

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:58.210
Among the projects completed were 13 Kingdom Halls, six remote translation offices and four missionary homes.

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:04.329
Some of these projects were new construction, whereas others were renovations.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:14.689
Many experiences showed Jehovah's blessing on these projects, some of which were shared in this month's JW Broadcasting program.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:24.849
Despite very poor conditions on many of these islands, there has been a heartwarming response to the May 2015

00:01:25.129 --> 00:01:31.810
JW Broadcast concerning our privilege to support Kingdom interests through our donations.

00:01:32.769 --> 00:01:42.010
Following the program, one couple of humble means decided to set aside $20 US dollars each month as a donation.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:50.049
Just last month, however, their bills exceeded their income by some $80.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:58.689
Not knowing how they were going to come up with the extra money, they thought about using the $20 to help pay for the expenses.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:09.210
In the end, though, they decided it was more important to donate the funds as they had resolved and look for another way to cover the deficit.

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:20.569
Well, shortly after making the donation, they both were surprised to learn that they had been selected as employees of the month for their good work.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.849
They reward a cash gift of $50 each.

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:30.729
The couple gives all the praise to Jehovah for the positive outcome.

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:40.569
In 2014, our branch received training to do audio video recording in the remote translation offices.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.409
As a result, the publishers have enjoyed using more videos in the ministry.

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:53.610
One missionary brother had invited a chukis couple he was studying with to the meeting many times,

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:58.330
but they had only attended once in the past year and a half.

00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:06.569
When the video, what happens at a kingdom hall became available in their language, the brother played the video for them.

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:12.729
The couple was impressed and commented that the kingdom hall was very different from their church.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.770
They attended the very next meeting, which happened to be the memorial.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.810
Experiencing for themselves, what they saw in the video, they continued attending meetings.

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:32.490
Last year, the branch office encouraged congregations to consider working unassigned territory.

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:42.330
In Micronesia, these are often isolated at tolls located hundreds of miles from the nearest congregation.

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:47.689
One group sailed to the hour atoll in the Marshall Islands.

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:55.849
On the little atoll island of Tobal, they preached and invited the residents to attend a public meeting

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:05.930
the very next day. To their surprise, 42 residents attended, which is about 25% of the island's population.

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:11.289
They were intrigued by the talk entitled, how does God view the dead?

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:18.250
The subject was timely because a father of three children had died in an accident,

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.129
and the local minister said it was God's will.

00:04:22.329 --> 00:04:29.449
Following the talk, about 20 people stayed to ask questions, some for up to two hours.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:38.889
Altogether, the group of five publishers placed 1,000 pieces of literature and started many Bible studies

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:45.610
in this atoll. Needless to say, this group is looking forward to making another trip to this

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:54.649
receptive territory. In Isaiah 42 and verse 12, it was foretold that Jehovah's people would declare

00:04:54.649 --> 00:05:01.930
his praise in the islands. We are happy that this prophecy is being fulfilled in the islands of

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:09.129
Micronesia, and it is a pleasure to bring to you all the love and greetings from these beautiful people.
