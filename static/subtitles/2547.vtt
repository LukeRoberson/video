00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.490
Welcome to the Brazil branch. Today we will show you the work that's being

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.849
carried out than the renovation of this beautiful branch. Our building's

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:23.129
house more than 1,150 BF and also provide workspace for an additional 600

00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:28.769
commuters. The last branch expansion finished in 1997 and since then there has

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.369
not been a renovation of its buildings. In addition, the way in which much of the

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:40.369
work is done here has changed a lot. During this period, the number of publishers

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:46.890
in Brazil has almost doubled reaching to more than 900,000. Although our

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.450
buildings are very well cared for, some mechanical, electrical and computer

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:58.329
systems are outdated, which limits their usefulness. For these and other

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:04.650
reasons, the renovation is necessary for Bethel to continue caring for the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:15.219
present and future needs of the organization. The renovation has already started.

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:21.219
Temporary accommodations have been created for more than 220 volunteers. These

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:35.500
accommodations will be used by the construction team. This is a renovated

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.260
apartment along with new finishes, the mechanical and electrical systems have

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.819
been replaced. The new windows have better thermal and acoustic insulation,

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:50.620
letting in more natural light and serving to economise resources. Each of the

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.340
over 650 apartments at the branch will be renovated. While on the subject of

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.700
economising and simplifying, now each Bethelite will wash their own clothes. 29

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.500
new laundry rooms are being constructed throughout the residential blocks. In

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.860
addition, practically all of the offices will be completely renovated and

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.379
modernised. We currently have office space for approximately 500 workers. The

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:24.539
renovation will create room for almost 900. The new layout will also provide the

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:34.349
option to reconfigure the office space to more than 1,050 workstations. Also, the

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.629
project includes plans to renovate and modernise most of the public areas

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:55.430
throughout the branch, creating a nice environment to work and live. In order

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.750
to accomplish this, we plan to have between 350 and 400 workers per day at the

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.949
renovation. I am 23 years old. I've always had the dream of serving in construction.

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:10.590
Then I had the privilege of being called to serve in the construction going on

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.030
here at Bethel. It's amazing. I work on the electrical crew. I took an electrical

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.509
course when I was 15. But the truth is, I really learn this profession here in

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:27.349
Bethel. This is my wife, Natalia. And this is my husband Jose. And this is our first

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:32.310
assignment together. I'm serving in the engineering department in the design

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.830
sector. I'm in Masonry, something I've never done before. At the end of the day

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:45.400
when I finish work, I feel like I've really accomplished something. We hope that

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.759
at the end of this project, these buildings will become a place that's even more

00:03:50.759 --> 00:04:29.639
efficient and better prepared to care for the future needs. Would you like to have

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:37.379
a part in this project? If so, know that your prayers and your contributions to

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:44.899
the worldwide work are a great help. Also, if your circumstances permit, then why not make

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:50.939
yourself available to come and serve as a volunteer on this or another construction project.
