00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.029
Three days before Jesus was put to death,

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:19.789
His disciples posed a question that has great importance for all of us today.

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.010
They asked Jesus,

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:28.390
What will be the sign of your presence and of the conclusion of the system of things?

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:35.590
In reply, Jesus foretold that a time period preceding the promised new world would be marked by events,

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:42.689
such as wars, earthquakes, food shortages, and pestilence.

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:45.189
Jesus then said,

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:48.689
For as they were in those days before the flood,

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:53.490
eating and drinking, men marrying, and women being given a marriage,

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.689
until the day that Noah entered into the ark,

00:00:56.689 --> 00:01:02.789
and they took no note, until the flood came and swept them all away,

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.290
so the presence of the Son of Man will be.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.189
With those words,

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.189
Jesus confirmed that Noah was a real person,

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.890
and that the flood was an actual historical event.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:27.790
He also warned us that the period just before the flood mirrors the period in which we live today.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.790
So it's important to consider closely what happened in Noah's day

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.290
and to see what we can learn from it.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.290
The opening chapters of the book of Genesis

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.689
give us a picture of what life was like in the centuries prior to Noah

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.189
after Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden.

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.290
Everyone spoke the same language,

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.590
and people had possibly developed the art of writing.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.189
They had built a city, maybe several cities.

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.090
They had learned how to forge copper and iron.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.289
They made musical instruments, harps and flutes,

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.090
and because they were much closer to the physical perfection of Adam and Eve,

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.090
they lived long lives, hundreds of years.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.590
But all was not well.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.189
People turned away from Jehovah, and as a result,

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:32.389
they became very violent and immoral.

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:37.090
Things got so bad that Jehovah moved a righteous man named Enoch,

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.490
the seventh man and the genealogical line from Adam,

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.789
to prophesy that God would not forever tolerate a wicked and rebellious world.

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:52.289
He'd execute judgment against the ungodly.

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:57.389
Of course, the ungodly people in Enoch's day didn't like what he was saying.

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:02.889
They hated Enoch, and they may have tried to kill him.

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:07.289
Enoch never saw the fulfillment of this prophecy.

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:15.669
Another 600 years passed, and by then conditions on earth had become even worse.

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:25.030
Let's read Genesis chapter 6 verses 1 through 7.

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:29.129
Now when men started to grow a number on the surface of the ground,

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.330
and daughters were born to them,

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.830
the sons of the true God began to notice that the daughters of men were beautiful.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.530
So they began taking as wives all whom they chose.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.530
Then Jehovah said,

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:46.129
My spirit will not tolerate men indefinitely,

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:48.430
because he is only flesh.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.330
Accordingly, his days will amount to 120 years.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.629
The Nephilim were on the earth in those days and afterward.

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:03.530
During that time, the sons of the true God continued to have relations with the daughters of men,

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.129
and these bore sons to them.

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:11.129
They were the mighty ones of old times, the men of fame.

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:16.329
Consequently, Jehovah saw that man's wickedness was great on the earth,

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:22.930
and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only bad all the time.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.230
Jehovah regretted that he had made men on the earth, and his heart was saddened.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.629
So Jehovah said,

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:36.029
I am going to wipe men whom I have created off the surface of the ground.

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:40.230
Man, together with domestic animals, creeping animals,

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.629
and flying creatures of the heavens,

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:48.209
where I regret that I have made them.

00:04:48.209 --> 00:04:54.410
During that time, some angels from heaven noticed beautiful human women

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.610
and developed lustful feelings for them.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:05.110
These angels rebelled against God by coming to earth and taking on human bodies

00:05:05.209 --> 00:05:09.110
in order to have sex with the women.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.009
They became selfish and wicked demons.

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:17.110
They may have been charming, intelligent, handsome,

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.810
and they had supernatural powers.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:28.610
They must have been irresistible, especially to women who themselves had no love of God.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.810
Perhaps the angels took some women by force,

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:38.410
whatever the case the angels took all whom they chose.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:44.709
What a human on earth at that time could hope to stop demons

00:05:44.709 --> 00:05:50.709
that these godless creatures people lost their daughters, their sisters,

00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:55.879
and possibly even their wives.

00:05:55.879 --> 00:06:00.480
The women became pregnant and gave birth to sons,

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.680
but their sons were not like other boys.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.480
They were stronger.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:11.180
They were bullies, aggressive, fierce, and brutal.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.079
Those qualities stayed with them as they grew.

00:06:15.079 --> 00:06:20.579
The boys became men, but they were unusually cruel.

00:06:20.579 --> 00:06:27.379
They were called Nephilim, possibly meaning those who caused others to fall down

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:30.180
and people feared them.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:35.180
Like their fathers, the Nephilim had no love for God,

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:42.180
and they cared only about their fame for being strong and vicious.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.480
The materialized angels in their savage offspring

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:53.259
dominated the world of that time and people followed their lead.

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:57.259
Jehovah saw that man's wickedness was rampant

00:06:57.259 --> 00:07:00.959
and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart

00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:05.160
was only bad all the time.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:11.360
How Satan must have delighted to see most humans reject Jehovah

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.160
and become more and more corrupt.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.259
But in that world of depraved people,

00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:24.459
there was a man who was faithful to Jehovah.

00:07:24.459 --> 00:07:32.889
Let's read about him in Genesis 6 and verse 8.

00:07:32.889 --> 00:07:36.689
But Noah found favor in the eyes of Jehovah.

00:07:36.689 --> 00:07:39.290
This is the history of Noah.

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:41.589
Noah was a righteous man.

00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:45.290
He proved himself faultless among his contemporaries.

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:48.689
Noah walked with the true God.

00:07:48.689 --> 00:07:52.290
In time, Noah became father to three sons,

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:55.290
Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:59.389
But the earth had become ruined in the sight of the true God

00:07:59.389 --> 00:08:02.689
and the earth was filled with violence.

00:08:02.689 --> 00:08:07.589
Yes, God looked upon the earth and it was ruined.

00:08:07.589 --> 00:08:12.759
All flesh had ruined its way on the earth.

00:08:12.759 --> 00:08:17.560
Some people today say that there was no such person as Noah

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.060
and that the account of the ark and the flood

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:24.060
was just a legend or a fairy tale.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:28.759
But the Bible writer knew that Noah really existed

00:08:28.759 --> 00:08:32.159
and that the flood truly happened.

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:36.860
The prophet Isaiah and Ezekiel both refer to Noah.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.960
Ezra, the writer of First Chronicles

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.460
and the gospel writer Luke both include Noah

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:45.960
and the chronologies they compiled.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.860
The apostles Peter and Paul both confirmed

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:52.759
the Genesis account of the flood.

00:08:52.759 --> 00:08:57.059
And as we mentioned earlier, the Son of God Himself

00:08:57.059 --> 00:09:00.860
testified that Noah was a real person

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:06.399
and that the flood really happened.

00:09:06.399 --> 00:09:09.700
Noah's faith was outstanding.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.100
He lived in an evil world.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.399
A world dominated, a terrorized angels

00:09:15.399 --> 00:09:17.500
there, violent offspring,

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:21.399
and a society of ungodly people.

00:09:21.399 --> 00:09:24.399
Noah lacked many of the things we have today

00:09:24.399 --> 00:09:27.100
to help us keep our faith strong.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.500
He had no Bible to help him to love Jehovah

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.700
and to understand his ways.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.899
He didn't know about all the faithful men and women

00:09:35.899 --> 00:09:39.100
who would live after him.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.100
And Noah had no congregation of fellow believers

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:46.700
to encourage him and to strengthen his faith.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:51.179
Yet Noah knew much.

00:09:51.179 --> 00:09:54.179
He knew what happened in the Garden of Eden

00:09:54.179 --> 00:09:57.279
and he could see the tragic results.

00:09:57.279 --> 00:10:00.980
He saw that people grew old and died.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:04.580
He knew that the way to the Garden of Eden was barred

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:08.179
and the ground outside had been cursed.

00:10:08.179 --> 00:10:11.580
He understood what his great grandfather, Enoch,

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.879
had foretold.

00:10:13.879 --> 00:10:15.980
And Noah knew that his father, Lamek,

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:20.779
had given him a name, likely meaning rest or consolation

00:10:20.779 --> 00:10:23.879
because he would, as his father foretold,

00:10:23.879 --> 00:10:26.179
bring us comfort from our labor

00:10:26.179 --> 00:10:29.679
and from the painful toil of our hands

00:10:29.679 --> 00:10:34.950
because of the ground that Jehovah has cursed.

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:40.049
Surely Noah wondered about these prophecies.

00:10:40.049 --> 00:10:42.450
How would he bring comfort?

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:46.149
How and when would God act against the wicked ones

00:10:46.149 --> 00:10:48.750
who surrounded him?

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:54.250
For hundreds of years Noah prayed and he wondered.

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:57.950
By the time he had lived well over 500 years,

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:03.559
he had married and had a family, three sons.

00:11:03.559 --> 00:11:06.159
Though he lived in a wicked world,

00:11:06.159 --> 00:11:09.259
Noah remained faithful to God

00:11:09.259 --> 00:11:13.259
and he helped his family to do the same.

00:11:13.259 --> 00:11:15.559
Then Jehovah delivered a message

00:11:15.559 --> 00:11:19.259
that surely must have stunned Noah.

00:11:19.259 --> 00:11:28.360
Let's continue reading from Genesis chapter 6, verse 13.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:32.340
After that, God said to Noah,

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:36.139
I have decided to put an end to all flesh

00:11:36.139 --> 00:11:40.639
because the earth is full of violence on account of them.

00:11:40.639 --> 00:11:45.840
So I am bringing them to ruin together with the earth.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:49.440
Make for yourself an ark from resinous wood.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.840
You will make compartments in the ark

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:56.440
and cover it with tar inside and outside.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.840
This is how you will make it.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.039
The ark should be 300 qubits long,

00:12:02.039 --> 00:12:07.340
50 qubits wide and 30 qubits high.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:10.840
You will make a window for light for the ark.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.840
One qubit from the top.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.940
You should put the entrance of the ark in its side

00:12:16.039 --> 00:12:18.039
and make it with a lower deck,

00:12:18.039 --> 00:12:21.539
a second deck and a third deck.

00:12:21.539 --> 00:12:23.039
As for me,

00:12:23.039 --> 00:12:26.539
I am going to bring flood waters upon the earth

00:12:26.539 --> 00:12:29.539
to destroy from under the heavens all flesh

00:12:29.539 --> 00:12:31.940
that has the breath of life.

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:35.440
Everything on the earth will perish.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.840
And I am establishing my covenant with you.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.940
And you must go into the ark.

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.940
You, your sons, your wife

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.139
and your sons' wives with you

00:12:46.139 --> 00:12:47.639
and bring into the ark

00:12:47.639 --> 00:12:50.940
two of every sort of living creature

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:53.639
in order to preserve them alive with you,

00:12:53.639 --> 00:12:57.039
a male and a female of the flying creatures

00:12:57.039 --> 00:12:59.039
according to their kinds,

00:12:59.039 --> 00:13:02.440
the domestic animals according to their kinds

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.340
and all creeping animals of the ground

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:07.840
according to their kinds.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.940
Two of each will go in there to you

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:12.740
to preserve them alive.

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:13.940
For your part,

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.940
you are to collect and take with you

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.340
every kind of food to eat,

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:24.899
to serve as food for you and for the animals.

00:13:24.899 --> 00:13:29.399
And Noah did according to all that God had commanded him.

00:13:29.399 --> 00:13:33.370
He did just so.

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:35.769
Noah had long wondered

00:13:35.769 --> 00:13:39.769
how Jehovah would act against an ungodly world.

00:13:39.769 --> 00:13:46.070
Now he knew a catastrophic flood would cleanse the earth.

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:50.970
Noah also knew what he and his family must do.

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:54.669
So much dependent on him.

00:13:54.669 --> 00:13:58.669
The thought must have been overwhelming.

00:13:58.669 --> 00:14:02.879
The ark would be gigantic.

00:14:02.879 --> 00:14:06.580
Now new questions occupied his mind.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:08.080
Trees.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.379
A great many trees would have to be felt

00:14:11.379 --> 00:14:14.480
in the timber hall shaped and joined.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.879
How would he do that?

00:14:16.879 --> 00:14:20.779
How would he gather so many kinds of animals?

00:14:20.779 --> 00:14:23.779
How would he get food supplies for the animals

00:14:23.779 --> 00:14:26.580
and for his family?

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:30.779
And what about the godless people around him?

00:14:30.779 --> 00:14:34.080
What would they think?

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.080
Noah knew what had happened to the righteous men

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.379
who preceded him.

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:42.779
Abel had been killed by his brother, King.

00:14:42.779 --> 00:14:45.879
And Enoch likely wasn't such danger of being slain

00:14:45.879 --> 00:14:50.980
by ungodly ones that God mercifully cut his life short

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:54.980
so they wouldn't fall into their hands.

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.779
People would see what he was doing

00:14:57.779 --> 00:15:01.679
and they'd soon learn why he was doing it.

00:15:01.679 --> 00:15:04.580
These god-designing Nephilim influence people

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:08.080
might react violently.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:13.179
Yet Noah trusted in Jehovah and he got to work.

00:15:13.179 --> 00:15:14.679
He did all of that.

00:15:14.679 --> 00:15:17.179
God had commanded him.

00:15:17.179 --> 00:15:20.580
It took a long time for Noah's family to build the ark.

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:24.580
Perhaps some 40 or 50 years.

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:26.980
There must have been challenges,

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:30.580
but we never read that Noah complained.

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.879
The family had no support from others.

00:15:33.879 --> 00:15:37.779
Remember that Jesus said that the people took no note

00:15:37.779 --> 00:15:41.980
until the flood came and swept them all away.

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:46.779
Of course, people took note that Noah was building an ark.

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:48.980
His neighbors must have asked him

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:53.179
why he was building such an enormous structure.

00:15:53.179 --> 00:15:56.879
And Noah explained to them why he was building it.

00:15:56.879 --> 00:16:00.279
But Noah's contemporaries took no note

00:16:00.279 --> 00:16:02.879
that Jehovah was blessing Noah

00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:05.779
and his construction efforts.

00:16:05.779 --> 00:16:09.879
They took no note of what this would mean for them.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:13.779
Instead, the people were caught up in everyday affairs,

00:16:13.779 --> 00:16:16.879
eating, drinking, and marrying.

00:16:16.879 --> 00:16:20.480
Those were the things that concerned them.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.879
To those godless people,

00:16:21.879 --> 00:16:25.779
Noah and his family were fools, crackpots.

00:16:25.779 --> 00:16:28.779
They were the butt of ridicule, jeers,

00:16:28.779 --> 00:16:32.850
and probably threats.

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:36.750
The ark was finally completed.

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:41.750
We can imagine Noah and his family looking at it with pride

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:45.149
and remembering how God had helped them.

00:16:45.149 --> 00:16:50.149
Jehovah always directs his servants when needed.

00:16:50.149 --> 00:16:53.549
Now, Jehovah spoke again to Noah.

00:16:53.549 --> 00:16:59.549
Let's read chapter 7 starting with verse 1.

00:16:59.549 --> 00:17:02.350
After that, Jehovah said to Noah,

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:05.950
Go into the ark, you and all your household,

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:08.950
because you are the one I have found to be righteous

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:11.650
before me among this generation.

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:16.150
You must take with you every kind of clean animal by sevens,

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:18.349
the male and its mate,

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:22.450
and of every animal that is not clean just two,

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:24.849
the male and its mate.

00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:28.750
Also of the flying creatures of the sky by sevens,

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:30.650
male and female,

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:34.549
to preserve their offspring alive over all the earth

00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:36.849
for in just seven days,

00:17:36.849 --> 00:17:40.849
I will make it rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights,

00:17:40.849 --> 00:17:43.349
and I will wipe from the surface of the ground

00:17:43.349 --> 00:17:46.549
every living thing that I have made.

00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:52.779
Then Noah did everything that Jehovah had commanded him.

00:17:52.779 --> 00:17:55.579
There was no time to lose.

00:17:55.579 --> 00:17:58.380
There was urgent work to do.

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:01.279
In seven days, the rains would come.

00:18:01.279 --> 00:18:05.180
Animals, many animals had to be situated in the ark.

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:07.779
Supplies had to be secured.

00:18:07.779 --> 00:18:11.380
Noah listened, and he obeyed.

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:14.180
For the second time in this inspired account,

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:19.779
we are told that Noah did all that he was commanded to do.

00:18:19.779 --> 00:18:26.380
Now please turn to Genesis chapter 7 and verse 6.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:31.579
Noah was 600 years old when the flood waters came upon the earth.

00:18:31.579 --> 00:18:34.980
So Noah, along with his sons, his wife,

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.579
and his sons' wives,

00:18:36.579 --> 00:18:40.680
went into the ark ahead of the flood waters.

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.980
Of every clean animal,

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.779
and of every animal that is not clean,

00:18:45.779 --> 00:18:47.579
and of the flying creatures,

00:18:47.579 --> 00:18:50.680
and of everything that moves on the ground,

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:54.980
they went inside the ark to Noah by twos,

00:18:55.079 --> 00:19:00.279
male and female, just as God had commanded Noah.

00:19:00.279 --> 00:19:02.579
And seven days later,

00:19:02.579 --> 00:19:06.579
the flood waters came upon the earth.

00:19:06.579 --> 00:19:09.180
In the 600th year of Noah's life,

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.680
in the second month,

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.180
on the 17th day of the month,

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:14.680
on that day,

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:19.380
all the springs of the vast watery, deep, burst open,

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:22.980
and the flood gates of the heavens were open.

00:19:23.079 --> 00:19:28.680
And the rain poured down on the earth for 40 days and 40 nights.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.480
On that very day,

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.180
Noah went into the ark,

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:33.880
along with his sons,

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.279
Shem, Ham, and Japheth,

00:19:36.279 --> 00:19:37.579
and his wife,

00:19:37.579 --> 00:19:40.980
and the three wives of his sons.

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:45.279
They went in with every wild animal according to its kind,

00:19:45.279 --> 00:19:48.480
and every domestic animal according to its kind,

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:52.880
and every creeping animal of the earth according to its kind,

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:56.079
and every flying creature according to its kind,

00:19:56.079 --> 00:19:57.279
every bird,

00:19:57.279 --> 00:19:59.779
every winged creature.

00:19:59.779 --> 00:20:02.779
They kept going to Noah inside the ark,

00:20:02.779 --> 00:20:04.480
two by two,

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:08.880
of every sort of flesh that has the breath of life.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.279
So they went in,

00:20:10.279 --> 00:20:13.380
male and female of every sort of flesh,

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.279
just as God had commanded him.

00:20:16.279 --> 00:20:17.279
After that,

00:20:17.279 --> 00:20:20.980
Jehovah shut the door behind him.

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:24.680
The flooding continued for 40 days on the earth,

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:29.380
and the waters kept increasing and began carrying the ark,

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:33.480
and it was floating high above the earth.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.779
The waters became overwhelming,

00:20:35.779 --> 00:20:39.180
and kept increasing greatly upon the earth,

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:43.779
but the ark floated on the surface of the waters.

00:20:43.779 --> 00:20:47.180
The waters overwhelmed the earth so greatly

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.380
that all the tall mountains

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:52.279
under the whole heavens were covered.

00:20:52.279 --> 00:20:57.680
The waters rose up to 15 cubits above the mountains,

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:02.380
so all living creatures that were moving on the earth perished,

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:03.880
the flying creatures,

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.380
the domestic animals,

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:06.880
the wild animals,

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.579
the swarming creatures,

00:21:08.579 --> 00:21:11.279
and all mankind.

00:21:11.279 --> 00:21:13.579
Everything on dry land

00:21:13.579 --> 00:21:17.980
that had the breath of life in its nostrils died.

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.579
So he wiped every living thing

00:21:20.579 --> 00:21:22.279
from the surface of the earth,

00:21:22.279 --> 00:21:24.880
including man, animals,

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.480
creeping animals,

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:29.079
and the flying creatures of the sky.

00:21:29.079 --> 00:21:32.279
They were all wiped off the earth,

00:21:32.279 --> 00:21:37.279
only Noah and those with him in the ark survived.

00:21:37.279 --> 00:21:39.119
And the waters continued

00:21:39.119 --> 00:21:45.349
overwhelming the earth for 150 days.

00:21:45.349 --> 00:21:49.549
If Noah had wondered how he would collect all those animals,

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:53.950
he now knew they would come to him.

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:56.349
Jehovah would bring them.

00:21:56.349 --> 00:21:59.450
Noah didn't have to go looking for them.

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:03.150
The animals did come every kind of animal,

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:08.450
some by sevens and some by twos.

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:12.849
Just imagine dozens and dozens of animals

00:22:12.849 --> 00:22:15.849
strutting, popping, slithering,

00:22:15.849 --> 00:22:18.650
and waddling into the ark.

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:22.950
We can imagine Noah's family finding places for them all,

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:26.549
stroking the soft fur of some animals as they passed,

00:22:26.549 --> 00:22:28.349
while avoiding the rough hides,

00:22:28.349 --> 00:22:29.950
or spines of others,

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:32.549
and making sure to get out of the way

00:22:32.549 --> 00:22:37.049
of the large animals as they lumbered past.

00:22:37.049 --> 00:22:39.150
The birds came too,

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:41.150
fluttering, soaring,

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:42.650
what colors,

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:45.750
what smells, what sounds.

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:48.349
No one as family must have shouted

00:22:48.349 --> 00:22:52.660
to hear one another above the den.

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:55.059
When all were inside,

00:22:55.059 --> 00:22:58.460
Jehovah shut the door.

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.759
Can you picture the family huddling together

00:23:00.759 --> 00:23:02.460
inside the ark,

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:03.759
listening,

00:23:03.759 --> 00:23:06.559
straining to hear,

00:23:06.559 --> 00:23:08.559
then it came,

00:23:08.559 --> 00:23:10.759
rain.

00:23:10.759 --> 00:23:13.460
Perhaps it began almost imperceptibly,

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:16.759
but soon it came in torrents.

00:23:16.759 --> 00:23:19.359
The sound was deafening.

00:23:19.359 --> 00:23:23.859
What they had long anticipated was now happening.

00:23:23.859 --> 00:23:25.559
They were tired,

00:23:25.559 --> 00:23:27.559
exhausted,

00:23:27.559 --> 00:23:32.660
but there was likely little sleep that night.

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:34.960
There were animals to check.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.059
There was the din of the rain,

00:23:37.059 --> 00:23:41.519
and how they prayed.

00:23:41.519 --> 00:23:44.819
Did their thoughts turn to those outside?

00:23:44.819 --> 00:23:46.720
Certainly.

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:48.319
They knew those people,

00:23:48.319 --> 00:23:50.319
and had preached to them.

00:23:50.319 --> 00:23:52.420
Many were relatives.

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:56.119
How sad for them.

00:23:56.119 --> 00:23:57.920
Like Jehovah,

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:02.720
Noah took no delight in the death of the wicked.

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:06.619
It saddened him that so many had to die,

00:24:06.619 --> 00:24:09.119
but he knew that those who perished

00:24:09.119 --> 00:24:13.119
had ample warning of what was to come.

00:24:13.119 --> 00:24:15.420
Even if they hadn't seen the ark,

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:17.220
Noah was building.

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:19.720
They would have heard about it.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:22.420
They'd know why he was building it.

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:25.019
Now it was too late for them.

00:24:25.019 --> 00:24:30.240
Jehovah had shut the door.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.539
Noah's family listened

00:24:32.539 --> 00:24:37.410
as the rain battered the ark without let it.

00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:39.309
And then came a moment.

00:24:39.309 --> 00:24:43.009
They would never forget movement.

00:24:43.009 --> 00:24:47.509
They felt their massive wooden ark lifting from the ground.

00:24:47.509 --> 00:24:50.309
It was floating.

00:24:50.309 --> 00:24:53.609
Their hearts were beating loud and fast.

00:24:53.609 --> 00:24:57.509
Would their vessel hold together?

00:24:57.509 --> 00:25:01.809
Let's resume our reading from Genesis chapter 8,

00:25:01.809 --> 00:25:03.609
verse 1,

00:25:03.609 --> 00:25:06.609
to see what happened next.

00:25:06.609 --> 00:25:08.910
But God gave attention to Noah

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:11.009
and to all the wild animals

00:25:11.009 --> 00:25:14.309
and domestic animals that were with him in the ark.

00:25:14.309 --> 00:25:17.910
And God caused a wind to blow over the earth

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:21.509
and the waters began to subside.

00:25:21.509 --> 00:25:23.410
The springs of the watery deep

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:26.509
and the floodgates of the heavens were stopped up

00:25:26.509 --> 00:25:30.910
so the rain from the heavens stopped falling.

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:35.410
Then the waters began to recede progressively from the earth.

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:38.109
By the end of 150 days,

00:25:38.109 --> 00:25:40.809
the waters had subsided.

00:25:40.809 --> 00:25:42.109
In the seventh month,

00:25:42.109 --> 00:25:44.710
on the 17th day of the month,

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:49.309
the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.

00:25:49.309 --> 00:25:52.009
And the waters were steadily decreasing

00:25:52.009 --> 00:25:54.109
until the 10th month.

00:25:54.109 --> 00:25:55.309
In the 10th month,

00:25:55.309 --> 00:25:57.109
on the 1st of the month,

00:25:57.109 --> 00:26:00.210
the tops of the mountains appeared.

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:02.609
So at the end of 40 days,

00:26:02.609 --> 00:26:05.809
Noah opened the window that he had made in the ark

00:26:05.809 --> 00:26:08.210
and sent out a raven.

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:10.710
It continued flying outside

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:14.609
and returning until the waters dried off the earth.

00:26:15.009 --> 00:26:17.509
Later, he sent out a dove

00:26:17.509 --> 00:26:19.509
to see whether the waters had receded

00:26:19.509 --> 00:26:21.910
from the surface of the ground.

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:24.910
The dove did not find any resting place to perch

00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:27.410
so it returned to him into the ark

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:30.210
because the waters were still covering the surface

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:32.309
of the whole earth.

00:26:32.309 --> 00:26:34.309
So he reached his hand out

00:26:34.309 --> 00:26:37.309
and brought it inside the ark.

00:26:37.309 --> 00:26:39.509
He waited seven more days

00:26:39.509 --> 00:26:40.509
and once again,

00:26:40.509 --> 00:26:43.710
he sent out the dove from the ark.

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:46.410
When the dove came to him toward evening,

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:49.609
he saw that there was a freshly plucked olive leaf

00:26:49.609 --> 00:26:51.109
in its bill.

00:26:51.109 --> 00:26:56.109
So Noah knew that the waters had receded from the earth.

00:26:56.109 --> 00:26:59.210
He waited still another seven days.

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:02.109
Then he sent out the dove

00:27:02.109 --> 00:27:06.309
but it did not return to him anymore.

00:27:06.309 --> 00:27:09.210
For 40 days and 40 nights,

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:12.309
the noise of torrential rain filled the ark

00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:15.309
and then it stopped.

00:27:15.309 --> 00:27:17.210
Imagine no one in his family

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:18.509
peering out of the ark

00:27:18.509 --> 00:27:20.609
and seeing nothing but water,

00:27:20.609 --> 00:27:23.109
no land anywhere.

00:27:23.109 --> 00:27:24.809
It went blue

00:27:24.809 --> 00:27:27.509
and the waters subsided.

00:27:27.509 --> 00:27:33.009
Finally, 150 days after the downpour began,

00:27:33.009 --> 00:27:35.509
the ark settled on land.

00:27:35.509 --> 00:27:39.809
What a happy day that must have been.

00:27:39.809 --> 00:27:42.109
Was it safe to go out?

00:27:42.109 --> 00:27:44.009
No.

00:27:44.009 --> 00:27:48.009
The waters had to subside further.

00:27:48.009 --> 00:27:52.009
There was plenty to do to keep the family busy.

00:27:52.009 --> 00:27:55.109
There were animals to feed and to care for.

00:27:55.109 --> 00:27:59.210
Still Noah's family must have longed to be outside,

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:01.710
to be free of the confinement,

00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:05.009
to feel the ground under their feet.

00:28:05.009 --> 00:28:07.509
Patience was needed.

00:28:07.509 --> 00:28:10.509
Picture the family spending time together,

00:28:10.509 --> 00:28:14.509
planning what they do when they came out of the ark.

00:28:14.509 --> 00:28:18.609
Another 73 days passed.

00:28:18.609 --> 00:28:23.160
Now they could see the tops of the mountains.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:26.559
Now was it safe to exit?

00:28:26.559 --> 00:28:28.960
Noah peered out of a window.

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:31.559
He selected from the birds a raven

00:28:31.559 --> 00:28:35.559
and he sent it out but it kept returning.

00:28:35.559 --> 00:28:37.559
Noah put the raven back in its place

00:28:37.559 --> 00:28:39.660
and selected a dove.

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:41.960
It too flew and returned,

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:45.259
not having found a place to perch.

00:28:45.259 --> 00:28:48.259
A week later, he released it again

00:28:48.259 --> 00:28:52.359
and it returned with an olive leaf in its bill.

00:28:52.359 --> 00:28:55.859
Seven days later, Noah sent it again.

00:28:55.859 --> 00:29:00.259
This time, it did not return.

00:29:00.259 --> 00:29:02.460
What next?

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:09.460
Let's continue reading from Chapter 8, verse 13.

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:11.960
Now in the 601st year,

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.559
in the first month,

00:29:13.559 --> 00:29:15.759
on the first day of the month,

00:29:15.759 --> 00:29:18.660
the waters had drained from the earth

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:21.859
and Noah removed the covering of the ark

00:29:21.859 --> 00:29:25.759
and saw that the surface of the ground was drying.

00:29:25.759 --> 00:29:29.160
In the second month, on the 27th day of the month,

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:31.559
the earth had dried off.

00:29:31.559 --> 00:29:34.259
God now said to Noah,

00:29:34.259 --> 00:29:36.059
Go out of the ark.

00:29:36.059 --> 00:29:40.660
You, your wife, your sons, and your sons' wives.

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:42.960
Bring out with you all the living creatures

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.759
of every sort of flutch,

00:29:44.759 --> 00:29:47.359
of the flying creatures and of the animals

00:29:47.359 --> 00:29:49.960
and of all the creeping animals of the earth

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.359
that they may multiply on the earth

00:29:52.359 --> 00:29:55.859
and be fruitful and become many on the earth.

00:29:55.859 --> 00:29:59.460
So Noah went out together with his sons,

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:02.859
his wife, and his sons' wives.

00:30:02.859 --> 00:30:04.559
Every living creature,

00:30:04.559 --> 00:30:06.559
every creeping animal,

00:30:06.559 --> 00:30:08.559
and every flying creature,

00:30:08.559 --> 00:30:10.759
everything that moves on the earth

00:30:10.759 --> 00:30:14.160
went out of the ark by families.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.960
Then Noah built an altar to Jehovah

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.259
and took some of all the clean animals

00:30:19.259 --> 00:30:21.859
and of all the clean flying creatures

00:30:21.859 --> 00:30:25.460
and offered burnt offerings on the altar.

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:29.660
And Jehovah began to smell a pleasing aroma.

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:33.259
So Jehovah said in his heart,

00:30:33.259 --> 00:30:37.559
Never again will I curse the ground on man's account

00:30:37.559 --> 00:30:40.559
for the inclination of the heart of man is bad

00:30:40.559 --> 00:30:42.359
from his youth up.

00:30:42.359 --> 00:30:44.359
And never again will I strike down

00:30:44.359 --> 00:30:47.859
every living thing as I have done.

00:30:47.859 --> 00:30:49.359
From now on,

00:30:49.359 --> 00:30:53.759
the earth will never cease to have seed-soy and harvest,

00:30:53.759 --> 00:31:02.579
cold and heat, summer and winter and day and night.

00:31:02.579 --> 00:31:05.880
When the dove didn't return,

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:09.480
Noah removed part of the roof of the ark.

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:13.279
Now he could see that much of the land had dried out.

00:31:13.279 --> 00:31:17.579
Possibly he could see vegetation growing and flourishing

00:31:17.579 --> 00:31:19.579
in a way that it hadn't been possible

00:31:19.579 --> 00:31:20.980
in the days before the flood

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:23.779
when the earth had been cursed.

00:31:23.779 --> 00:31:29.180
Still Noah waited for Jehovah's direction.

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:31.480
And then it came.

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:35.180
Jehovah's Command, go out of the ark.

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:42.180
At last, what a joyful day that must have been.

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:46.779
They'd been in the ark for 370 days.

00:31:46.779 --> 00:31:49.579
Picture the family coming out of the ark,

00:31:49.579 --> 00:31:53.180
laughing, breathing fresh air,

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:56.779
eager to adjust to their new life.

00:31:56.779 --> 00:31:59.279
The annals came out too.

00:31:59.279 --> 00:32:04.380
And the family watched as they dispersed in all directions.

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:05.779
Some they'd drawn close to,

00:32:05.779 --> 00:32:08.180
but now it was farewell.

00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:11.279
A happy farewell.

00:32:11.279 --> 00:32:13.880
There were no materialized angels,

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:19.130
no Nephilim and no wicked people.

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:23.630
How grateful they were to Jehovah.

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:26.029
Noah wasted no time.

00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:29.230
He built an altar and sacrificed to Jehovah

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:33.730
and God expressed his pleasure.

00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:37.730
Jehovah assured the family that he would never again

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:41.730
strike down every living thing.

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:44.829
But he did more than that.

00:32:44.829 --> 00:32:48.730
He concluded a covenant with Noah and his sons

00:32:48.829 --> 00:32:53.630
and gave them a sign that we too can observe.

00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:56.930
Let's read about it at Genesis 9,

00:32:56.930 --> 00:33:00.730
starting with verse 8.

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:02.529
Then God said to Noah,

00:33:02.529 --> 00:33:05.230
until his sons with him,

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:08.630
I am now establishing my covenant with you

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:11.230
and with your offspring after you

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:14.529
and with every living creature that is with you.

00:33:14.529 --> 00:33:16.630
The birds, the animals,

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:19.730
and all the living creatures of the earth with you,

00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:22.430
all those that came out of the ark,

00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:25.329
every living creature of the earth.

00:33:25.329 --> 00:33:29.029
Yes, I establish my covenant with you.

00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:33.829
Never again will all flesh be destroyed by the waters of a flood.

00:33:33.829 --> 00:33:37.930
And never again will a flood bring the earth to ruin.

00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:39.730
And God added,

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:41.829
this is the sign of the covenant

00:33:41.829 --> 00:33:44.230
that I am making between me and you

00:33:44.329 --> 00:33:47.230
and every living creature that is with you

00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:50.329
for all future generations.

00:33:50.329 --> 00:33:53.430
I put my rainbow in the cloud

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:56.230
and it will serve as a sign of the covenant

00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:59.130
between me and the earth.

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:01.829
Whenever I bring a cloud over the earth,

00:34:01.829 --> 00:34:05.230
then the rainbow will certainly appear in the cloud.

00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:08.230
And I will certainly remember my covenant

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:11.130
that I made between me and you

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:14.630
and every living creature of every kind.

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:17.829
And never again will the waters become a flood

00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:20.030
to destroy all flesh.

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:22.829
And the rainbow will occur in the cloud.

00:34:22.829 --> 00:34:25.030
And I will certainly see it

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:27.530
and remember the everlasting covenant

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:30.530
between God and every living creature

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:34.940
of every kind on the earth.

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:39.739
What a magnificent sign Jehovah gave.

00:34:39.739 --> 00:34:42.539
Every rainbow would remind both God

00:34:42.539 --> 00:34:46.139
and man of his promise.

00:34:46.139 --> 00:34:48.639
How Noah's family must have marveled

00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:52.739
to see the colors spanning across the sky.

00:34:52.739 --> 00:35:00.559
Violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red.

00:35:00.559 --> 00:35:06.659
Never again will a flood deluge the earth.

00:35:06.659 --> 00:35:12.059
But Jehovah is not one to tolerate wickedness forever.

00:35:12.059 --> 00:35:15.659
Let's read what the Apostle Peter wrote.

00:35:15.659 --> 00:35:21.059
Please turn to 2 Peter, chapter 2 and verse 5.

00:35:21.059 --> 00:35:24.159
The Apostle wrote,

00:35:24.159 --> 00:35:27.659
and he, God, did not refrain from punishing

00:35:27.659 --> 00:35:30.260
an ancient world but kept Noah,

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:34.460
a preacher of righteousness, safe with seven others

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:41.230
when he brought a flood upon a world of ungodly people.

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:46.829
Today we live in a world that resembles the one before the flood.

00:35:46.829 --> 00:35:51.030
There's violence and people do all sorts of things

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:54.130
that Jehovah hates.

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:57.530
People are concerned with the everyday affairs of life

00:35:57.530 --> 00:36:02.230
and take no note of the message of salvation

00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:05.230
that we proclaim.

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:08.630
Ridiculars of God's people mockingly say,

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:12.230
where is this promised presence of His?

00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:15.329
Why all things are continuing exactly

00:36:15.329 --> 00:36:19.230
as they were from creations beginning?

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:22.730
They are wrong.

00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:26.429
Jehovah acted against wickedness in the time of Noah

00:36:26.429 --> 00:36:29.730
and he'll act again.

00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:34.730
But like Noah, the faithful will be saved.

00:36:34.829 --> 00:36:37.230
God's word assures us.

00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:40.429
Jehovah knows how to rescue people

00:36:40.429 --> 00:36:43.929
of godly devotion out of trial

00:36:43.929 --> 00:36:48.130
but to reserve on righteous people to be destroyed

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:51.860
on the day of judgment.

00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:54.860
Jehovah will make the earth a paradise

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:58.260
just as he originally purchased.

00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:02.059
The paradise will be inhabited by good people.

00:37:02.059 --> 00:37:06.059
There will be no people who rebel against God

00:37:06.059 --> 00:37:09.960
and what are the rebellious spirit creatures?

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:13.059
When the flood delus the earth and Noah's day,

00:37:13.059 --> 00:37:15.860
the rebellious angels left their human bodies

00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:21.360
and returned to the spirit realm and disgrace.

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:24.159
However, these demons have continued

00:37:24.159 --> 00:37:29.360
to exert an evil influence on humans down to this day.

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.960
But when Jehovah acts again,

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:35.360
the demons and their rulers Satan

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:40.820
will be put out of action.

00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:43.420
The word of God says this.

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:47.420
By faith, Noah, after receiving divine warning

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:50.719
of things not yet seen, showed godly fear

00:37:50.719 --> 00:37:56.119
and constructed an ark for the saving of his household.

00:37:56.119 --> 00:38:00.019
Faith moved Noah to obey Jehovah.

00:38:00.019 --> 00:38:04.820
As a result, he and his family survived the flood.

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:07.320
Noah lived a long life.

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:10.420
Some nine hundred and fifty years.

00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:13.719
When that faithful man is resurrected,

00:38:13.719 --> 00:38:19.780
he'll have the prospect of living forever.

00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:22.980
If we display the faith of Noah and obey Jehovah,

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:27.280
we too can walk with Jehovah as our friend

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:31.780
and that friendship can last forever.
