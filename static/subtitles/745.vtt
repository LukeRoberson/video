00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:09.070
I like to start by telling you an experience of a brother at Patterson Bethel.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:16.670
He had recently lost a loved one, a parent, in fact, in a horrible accident, and he had

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.350
desperately needed to talk with someone about what he was going through and how he was

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.429
feeling.

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:29.070
He was in a word, unraveling, and he needed help.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.429
So he called a close friend of his at Wal-Kill, Bethel, but unfortunately the brother said

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:41.590
that at that time he was unable to talk.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:49.549
Have you ever found yourself in a similar situation that is feeling like you're drowning and

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:52.109
in need of assistance?

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:54.670
The psalmist did.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:01.750
Please read with me his words in the 94th Psalm and note his question.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:15.269
It's Psalm 94, verse 16, the psalmist asked in part, who will rise up for me?

00:01:15.269 --> 00:01:20.709
Who will rise up for me?

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:26.469
He goes on to answer his own question in verses 17 and 19.

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:33.430
He says, if Jehovah had not been my helper, I would have soon perished.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:41.349
When anxieties overwhelmed me, you, Jehovah, you comforted and soothed me.

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:48.950
Well when you and I send up such heartfelt prayers to Jehovah, how does he rise up for us?

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:56.469
And how can we imitate him by rising up in behalf of others?

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:01.030
Let's go back in time and consider an example.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:09.590
During the days of Israel's judges, their lived a wealthy landowner named Boaz.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.750
In obedience to Jehovah's law, he made sure that in his fields, cleanings were left for

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.990
the afflicted and poor.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:27.509
One day, he observes a woman working in his fields that he does not recognize.

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:34.550
And soon he learns that she is the foreigner, Ruth, whom up to this point he has only heard

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.550
about.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.189
Well, what does Boaz do?

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:46.229
Notice how he rolls up for her at Ruth chapter 2, verse 8.

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:55.270
Ruth chapter 2, starting with verse 8, Boaz said to Ruth, listen, my daughter, do not

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.509
go away to glean in another field.

00:02:58.509 --> 00:03:03.909
And do not go anywhere else, stay close by my young women.

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:09.870
Keep your eyes on the field that they harvest and go with them.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.110
I have commanded the young men not to touch you.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:20.030
When you are thirsty, go to the water jars and drink from what the young men have drawn.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.110
Clearly, Boaz protected Ruth.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.229
He brought her under his loving care.

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:35.870
We see him looking out for, shielding, defending the one in need.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:43.509
And when Ruth, according to verse 10, questions his motive for helping her, a foreigner.

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:47.830
Notice a second way he rolls up in her behalf.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:57.189
Ruth chapter 2, verse 11, Boaz answered her, a full report was made to me of all you have

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:04.669
done for your mother-in-law after the death of your husband and how you left your father

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:13.349
and your mother and the land of your relatives to go to a people whom you had not known before.

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:20.230
May Jehovah reward you for what you have done, and may there be a perfect wage for you

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:28.509
from Jehovah, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to seek refuge.

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:37.029
To this she said, let me find favor in your eyes, my Lord, because you have comforted

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:48.310
me and spoken reassuringly to your servant, although I am not even one of your servants.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:59.350
When Boaz spoke reassuringly to Ruth, the footnote says that he spoke to her heart, how so.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.629
His words were not just general expressions of praise.

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:09.110
They were specific to Ruth into her personal circumstances.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:16.709
He reassured Ruth that Jehovah loved her for all the sacrifices she had made and she

00:05:16.709 --> 00:05:19.629
would not be forgotten.

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:28.629
Those comforting, encouraging words of Boaz convinced Ruth that everything was going to be okay,

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:33.350
but Boaz did more than offer reassuring words.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.870
Notice the third way he rose up.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.949
Ruth chapter 4, verse 9.

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:47.470
By taking swift action, Boaz ensured that the inheritance of his deceased relative,

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:54.430
Alemilek, would remain in their family, chapter 4, verse 9.

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.389
Boaz said to the elders and all the people,

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:07.750
you are witnesses today that I am buying from Naomi, all that, excuse me, all that belonged

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:13.790
to Alemilek and all that belonged to Killian and Maulin.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:21.389
I am also requiring Ruth the Moabite, it's the wife of Maulin as a wife, for what reason?

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:26.870
To restore the name of the dead man to his inheritance.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:32.470
So that the name of the dead man will not be cut off from among his brothers and from

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.230
the city gate of his home.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:46.170
You are witnesses today, Jehovah used Boaz to rise up for Ruth and Naomi in three main

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:48.129
ways.

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:53.529
One, he protected those under his care.

00:06:53.529 --> 00:07:03.410
Secondly, he spoke reassuringly to them, and third, he took action.

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:08.170
Seeing the need, it rose up to meet it.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:14.209
He protected, he reassured, he took action.

00:07:14.209 --> 00:07:19.649
Well, how about you and me?

00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:25.529
Should we not do the same for those in need of assistance?

00:07:25.529 --> 00:07:29.160
And what can result when we do?

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:37.000
Well, before you answer that, let's go back to our opening experience.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:44.879
You see the very next morning, upon arriving at his work assignment, our distressed brother

00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:49.800
received a phone call from the Patterson lobby.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:54.800
It was the brother, the friend from Wallkill.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:01.600
He had gotten up early that morning, had driven over an hour from the Wallkill complex to

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.399
reach the Patterson complex by 8 a.m.

00:08:05.399 --> 00:08:12.920
He had arranged for a private conference room, and he was there waiting for that distressed

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:18.759
friend, so he could find out how can I help.

00:08:18.759 --> 00:08:27.240
That was 22 years ago, but I can tell you now, I have never forgotten what that friend

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:32.759
did for me when he rose up for me on that day.

00:08:32.759 --> 00:08:42.120
By means of the action that he took, I felt reassured, I felt protected, I felt loved.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:51.240
So the question for you 24 students, in fact, the question for all of us in our hearing

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:59.320
audience is this, what will you do to rise up for someone in need?

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:06.960
We have every confidence that each and every one of you will answer that call when it comes

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:11.960
saying, here I am, I will rise up for you, how can I help?
