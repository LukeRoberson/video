00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.929
The peak number of publishers reporting in Zimbabwe

00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:09.929
during the 2014 service year was 43,113 in August 2014.

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:17.410
Just two months later in October 2014,

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.410
we had a new all-time peak of 43,635 publishers.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.089
This means that in just over a year

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:28.769
we had increased by three medium-sized circuits.

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:32.090
We'd like to thank the governing body

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.090
for selecting Harari Zimbabwe to host an international convention,

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:43.090
which was held August 22-24-2014.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.450
This was the busiest time in the history

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.689
of the Kingdom work in Zimbabwe.

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:50.210
Even publishers and remote congregations

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.090
were involved with the preparations in one way or another.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.969
Here is an interesting experience from the convention.

00:00:58.689 --> 00:01:02.289
Mr. Murandu and his family are studying the Bible

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:04.370
and attending meetings.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.370
When he heard of the international convention in February,

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.810
he immediately applied for leave

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.609
and in addition spoke to the manager

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:16.209
to be sure that he would have tarmed off from work.

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:18.170
This was granted.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.250
Then in June he reminded the manager again.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.569
The manager confirmed that there was no problem.

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:29.010
However, the Thursday before the convention,

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.129
the manager called him and told him

00:01:31.129 --> 00:01:33.689
that he had changed his mind.

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.769
Mr. Murandu had to report for work.

00:01:36.769 --> 00:01:39.849
His vacation had been cancelled.

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:42.810
This was not a matter open for discussion he was told.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.810
If he did not report for work, he would be fired.

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.010
What would Mr. Murandu do?

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.370
He was determined.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.129
He would rather lose his job than miss this convention.

00:01:55.129 --> 00:01:57.209
In Zimbabwe, for one to do this,

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:59.450
he must have thought deeply about the matter

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.170
for jobs are hard to combat.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.170
Friday morning of the convention,

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.969
he and his family went to the convention.

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.650
As he entered the stadium, who did he see?

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.009
But the manager, they looked at each other in amazement.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.289
Mr. Murandu, you're supposed to be at work.

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:22.210
I told you, you leave was cancelled.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.810
I'm sorry sir, but I just had to be here.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.050
But allow me to ask, why are you here yourself?

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.969
He said that he'd been given an invitation

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:34.969
by one of the delegates early that week

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:37.370
and decided he would attend.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.330
That was when he decided to cancel Mr. Murandu's leave

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.330
so that he would be at work while he,

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.500
the manager, was at the convention.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.060
He then walked away.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.580
Both of them attended all three days of the program.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.340
On Monday, Mr. Murandu went for work

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.740
and found out that he was still employed.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.259
He and his family continued to make good spiritual progress.

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:08.939
There's no question but that the Harari International Convention

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:13.219
has put Jehovah's Witnesses firmly on the map in Zimbabwe

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:18.789
and ensured many more know about Jehovah's name and his people.

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:22.909
It is our pleasure to convey to the Bethel family here,

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:25.509
including our dear brothers of the governing body,

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:29.069
the warm love of the 140 members of the Bethel family

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.909
in Zimbabwe.
