00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:07.320
Water.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:13.419
From space, it is our planet's most striking feature.

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:17.780
We find water everywhere that we find life.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.179
And this is no coincidence.

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:29.019
For each drop of water has extraordinary properties that are essential for all living things.

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:36.700
For example, North American redwood trees can grow to be over 100 meters tall.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:44.219
Water, carrying nutrients must travel from the roots all the way up to the highest leaf.

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.219
How does water overcome gravity to reach these great heights?

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.420
To help answer this, notice what happens when a narrow glass tube is placed in a dish of

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.380
water.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.619
Water begins to rise inside the tube.

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:08.060
What causes this to happen?

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.780
As we have considered, water is a polar molecule, that is, one side has a negative charge, and

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.019
the other side has a positive charge.

00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:24.219
As a result, water molecules form what are called hydrogen bonds with other polar molecules,

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:29.540
including the glass molecules just above them in the sides of the tube.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.500
At the same time, the bonds between the water molecules pull the surface-taught and draw

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.379
up the molecules below, like links in a chain.

00:01:40.379 --> 00:01:48.700
These same forces, adhesion and cohesion are at work in trees.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:55.459
Water rises inside the trunk of a tree via tiny capillaries or tubes.

00:01:55.459 --> 00:02:01.579
Meanwhile, as water evaporates from the leaves, it creates an upward pull that is transmitted

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:06.060
through the chain of water molecules below.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:13.060
Together, these forces lift the water, carrying vital nutrients to each limb, branch, twig,

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.580
and leaf.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.500
All around us, this amazing process is quietly at work in plants, from the smallest wild

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:31.240
flower to the tallest tree, which in turn provide food and oxygen for humans and animals.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.000
But perhaps our most direct and personal connection to water comes from its role within

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.719
our own bodies.

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:45.159
From the blood that circulates through our veins to the fluid around and inside our cells,

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:49.159
water is the perfect medium for life.

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:55.159
As a powerful solvent, water breaks down salts, minerals, and other nutrients, carrying

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:59.680
these in solution to nourish our cells.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.080
As a chemical reactant, it is essential in the digestion of our food.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.520
Even proteins, the fundamental building blocks of our cells, have a special relationship

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.639
with water.

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:20.400
To function correctly, a protein must be folded into a specific three-dimensional shape.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.719
And this crucial folding process is guided by subtle interactions between the protein and

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:29.289
water.

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:36.889
Yes, in every way, the properties of water are precisely balanced to support life.

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:45.340
Without water, our cells would be as dry and lifeless as a harbor in the middle of a desert.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:56.259
Instead, water energizes our cells, keeping us active, healthy, and alive.

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:59.979
What an extraordinary creation water is.

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:04.740
And what a unique role it has been given in sustaining all living things on our beautiful

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.900
planet Earth.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:15.180
On every level, from the tiniest molecules to the vast ocean spanning the globe, water

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:22.100
is masterfully interwoven with the fabric of life.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:28.860
It is a powerful and daily testimony to our wise creator, Jehovah God, the one who made

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.259
the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters.
