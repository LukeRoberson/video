00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:10.710
And in production to the book of Haggai, Haggai was likely born in Babylon.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.390
In 537 BCE, he traveled with a remnant of the Jewish nation to Jerusalem, where he would

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.690
later serve as a prophet.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.350
Haggai completed his book in 520 BCE.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.230
But why did Jehovah cause him to begin prophesying?

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:35.270
In 536 BCE, the Jews laid the foundation for the New Temple in Jerusalem.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.350
Sadly, the work stopped for many years because of opposition for enemies and apathy on

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.710
the part of the Jews.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.469
In the year 520 BCE, Jehovah sent Haggai to rekindle the zeal of the Jews in order to

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:53.670
resume temple construction.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:01.210
The temple was finally completed in 515 BCE.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.969
Did you know?

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:10.810
In the 38 verses that make up chapters 1 and 2, Haggai uses the name Jehovah 35 times,

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:18.420
14 times in the expression Jehovah of Armies.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.379
The book of Haggai has two chapters that convey four inspired messages.

00:01:25.379 --> 00:01:30.420
Chapter 1 directs the first message toward those who are focusing on their own interests

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.670
while Jehovah's House lies in ruins.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.189
Governors are rubbable, high priest Joshua, and the rest of the people respond favorably,

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:48.750
and go to work on the temple just 23 days after Haggai started to prophesy.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.390
In chapter 2, Haggai delivers the second inspired message.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.469
Jehovah promises that he will shake the nations and cause their precious things to come in,

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:04.459
and that he will fill his house with glory.

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:10.699
Later, Haggai delivers the third inspired message to the priests, explaining that neglect

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:18.150
of pure worship has made the nation unclean before God.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.949
Then Haggai proclaims the fourth message.

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:25.870
Again, Jehovah speaks of shaking the heavens and the earth, but this time it will mean

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.789
the complete annihilation of human kingdoms.

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:38.229
Centuries afterward, the Apostle Paul quoted Haggai's words to show that God's kingdom

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:43.699
in the hands of Jesus Christ will never be shaken.

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:50.259
As you read Haggai, note how personal interests must take a backseat to spiritual interests.

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:56.620
How mere formalistic worship does not please Jehovah, and how God's kingdom in the hands

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.259
of Jesus Christ will never be shaken.
