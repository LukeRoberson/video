00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:35.659
Welcome to the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses at Warwick, New York.

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:40.780
As Jehovah's people, we are multicultural and multilingual.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.899
And as the artwork here emphasizes, our focus is on our commission to preach the good

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.939
news to people of all nations.

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:54.340
So what are we doing today as an organization?

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.100
How did we get here?

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.780
And what's our main tool for this great work?

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.939
We invite you to come to our museums to find out.

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:11.260
We have three museums here at Warwick, all funded by voluntary donations.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.939
Each of them is alive with stories.

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.900
Upstairs on the second floor is the museum, Faith in Action.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.939
There we'll see the very latest on what's being done by Jehovah's organization.

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.739
Also on the second floor is the museum, A People for Jehovah's Day.

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:37.180
It takes us on an exciting journey back in time.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.540
And downstairs, we have the Bible Museum.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.140
There we'll get to see up close a spiritual treasure chest.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.260
When you tour the museums, you'll notice that they were designed to be not passive,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.620
but interactive so that you can put yourself in the experience.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:07.180
So with that preview, let's take the tour.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.740
This is the launching point to the Faith in Action Museum.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.099
Note that important descriptive word, action.

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:23.020
What activities or actions are being organized and directed by the governing body today?

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.300
This display equates you right away with the work of the governing body committees.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.259
Each committee has specific responsibilities, but as you take the tour,

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:39.819
notice how the committees work together to accomplish their goals.

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.580
The Faith in Action Museum is divided into four galleries.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:53.099
Show love, meet together, take in spiritual food, and make disciples.

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:59.780
As you walk through the galleries, notice how each of them is connected by a JW Blue Ribbon.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.469
So if you get lost, just follow the Blue Ribbon.

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:08.150
This is the show love gallery.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.830
Here you'll learn how the governing body helps God's people to have love among themselves.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.310
As Jesus commanded, at John 1335.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:25.949
For example, how do the brothers and headquarters respond to needs that arise when a disaster strikes?

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:32.750
When things like natural disasters, terrorist attacks, or civil unrest occur,

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.509
the coordinators committee directs relief efforts.

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:42.550
They in turn communicate with the branch committee that oversees the affected area,

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.310
usually within 48 hours, a report of what's occurred,

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.990
and what's being done to help our brothers is compiled and sent to headquarters.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:04:00.990
That report may be the basis for informing the brotherhood through an article on JW.org.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.629
There's another way that love is shown to Jehovah's people.

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:09.789
Schools, such schools as the School for Congregation Elders,

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.509
and the School for Circuit Overseers and their wives.

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:20.829
These have been very effective in training brothers to shepherd the congregations lovingly.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.550
The Teaching Committee is responsible for the curriculum,

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.949
while the Service Committee arranges for the selection of the students.

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:32.910
This is the Meet Together Gallery.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.990
Here you'll learn how the governing body is helping God's people to meet together,

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:45.949
to incite to love and find works as directed at Hebrews 10, 24, and 25.

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:50.430
How is the headquarters staff at Warwick filling that need?

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.709
Because we keep growing, there is an ongoing need to build new kingdoms

00:04:55.709 --> 00:04:58.430
and to renovate existing ones.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.949
The Publishing Committee of the governing body directs where kingdom halls will be built

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:07.790
and makes funds available to the branches.

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.629
The Publishing Committee works closely with the branch office

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:16.470
and its local design construction department carries out the work.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.430
But where do these hardworking brothers and sisters come from?

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.189
The Personnel Committee appoints all construction servants

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:29.430
for assignments in their home country or in a foreign land.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.589
Have you worked on a Theocratic Building project?

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:35.670
Take our survey and let us know.

00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:41.709
Some kingdom halls are located in areas where there is little or no electricity,

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:45.870
but that doesn't stop us from meeting together.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.829
The Publishing Committee has arranged for a custom-built portable sound system

00:05:50.829 --> 00:05:53.589
to be used in these areas.

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:58.990
The Unity Player has a battery that can be recharged by its solar panel

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.029
or with a built-in hand crank.

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:06.990
It's a wonderful provision that helps our brothers and sisters benefit more

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.069
from their congregation meetings.

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:13.350
This is the take-in spiritual food gallery.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.230
Can you guess what design we used?

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.990
That's right, a dining table.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.430
Here, you'll learn how the governing body fulfills the Scriptural Commission

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:29.430
at Luke 1242 to feed God's people spiritually.

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:34.110
To accomplish this, millions of Bibles, Books,

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:40.149
and other publications need to be prepared, translated, and printed.

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:45.550
In addition, a regular flow of material is released online.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:51.029
Translators around the world keep in close contact with translation services,

00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:56.189
a headquarters department that supervise by the Writing Committee.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:59.509
Do you have a favorite publication?

00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:02.829
Much more is involved in just the writing.

00:07:02.829 --> 00:07:07.949
The section from Start to Finish outlines 11 steps

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:11.350
that are taken to produce the final product.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.670
What about our online spiritual food?

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:20.550
Each month, we look forward to a new JW Broadcasting Program.

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:24.230
Once the Teaching Committee approves a video idea,

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:27.550
audio video services research is the subject,

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:31.589
and prepares a script for final approval.

00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:35.829
Approved scripts and storyboards are assigned to video production teams

00:07:35.829 --> 00:07:37.670
around the world.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:42.790
This gives our videos an international flavor.

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:47.389
Well, we've come to our final gallery, Make Disciples.

00:07:47.389 --> 00:07:50.870
Here, you'll learn how the governing body is helping us

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:55.750
to fulfill the Scriptural Commission at Matthew 28, 19,

00:07:55.750 --> 00:08:01.790
to make disciples of people of all nations baptizing them.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:06.750
The command to preach can be daunting, especially in certain lands.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:10.389
So how are we meeting that challenge?

00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:14.589
The Service Committee oversees the preaching work worldwide.

00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:18.230
They help all to have a share according to their ability,

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:24.189
some as congregation publishers, others as full-time evangelizers.

00:08:24.189 --> 00:08:28.829
Additionally, special preaching campaigns and public witnessing

00:08:28.829 --> 00:08:32.750
have resulted in many new Bible studies.

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:35.750
At times, though, our religious freedom

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:38.789
is opposed by secular authorities.

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:41.990
So the coordinators committee supervises

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:45.149
the World Headquarters Legal Department.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:48.830
Many courts have handed down favorable decisions.

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:55.990
Still, we must continue to defend our right to preach the good news.

00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:01.629
Our online tools are also a huge help in making disciples.

00:09:01.629 --> 00:09:06.429
This counter shows the average rate at which people worldwide

00:09:06.429 --> 00:09:09.870
are logging on to JW.org.

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:16.549
Each day, some 250 Bible studies are requested online.

00:09:16.549 --> 00:09:19.990
Schools also help us to make disciples.

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:22.629
We have the Pioneer Service School,

00:09:22.629 --> 00:09:27.870
the School for Kingdom Evangelizers and Gilead School.

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:30.590
Have you attended one of these schools?

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:33.600
Let us know.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.399
Well, as we come to the end of our tour,

00:09:36.399 --> 00:09:41.960
we hope you enjoyed some highlights from this faith in action museum.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:46.799
What we've seen here reminds us that now and always,

00:09:46.799 --> 00:09:53.200
Jehovah's people are a people of faith, faith in action.
