No human can foretell the future in exact detail.

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:14.839
Yet about the year 732 BCE, the Prophet Isaiah foretold

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.839
that a man named Cyrus would conquer the mighty city of Babylon,

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:25.839
that he would dry up a river, and that he would enter the city through open gates.

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:31.839
History confirms that every detail of this prophecy was fulfilled.

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:35.840
Concerning the same city, the Prophet Jeremiah foretold,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.840
that Babylon would become piles of stones and never again be inhabited.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.840
Despite a strategic location, Babylon eventually became a pile of stones and remains that way.
