00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:05.910
The theme for our program is, the women proclaiming the good news.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:14.910
Sadly, throughout human history, women have been subjected to injustice, violence, and abuse.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.910
Why is that? The Bible explains.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:27.910
In the latter part of Genesis 3 and verse 16, notice what God says.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:35.219
Your longing will be for your husband and he will dominate you.

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:44.219
When God said that Adam would dominate his wife, God was not indicating his approval of the subjugation of woman by man.

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.219
He was simply for telling the sad consequences of sin on the first couple.

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:59.219
So, abuse of women is a direct outcome of a sinful nature of humans, not of God's will.

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:07.219
Right down to our day, rarely have women been accorded the dignity that God wants them to receive.

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:16.219
However, Jehovah makes clear in his word the Bible that women and men have equal standing before him.

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:23.219
In fact, he indicated that women would play a vital role in the outworking of his purpose.

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:29.219
Our theme is based on Psalm 68 and verse 11.

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:31.219
Let's read it.

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:39.219
Jehovah gives the command, the women proclaiming the good news are a large army.

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:46.500
Those words were inspired by God, but what did this psalmist have in mind when he pinned them?

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:54.500
The context of Psalm 68 shows that David was praising Jehovah as a God of saving acts.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:01.500
From the time of their exodus from Egypt, the men of Israel often had to fight against enemy nations.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:10.500
With Jehovah's help, they defeated them, and the entire nation would then rejoice over the victory Jehovah had given them.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:22.500
The first of the victory celebrations recorded in the Bible was at the time that Jehovah gave his people the victory over Pharaoh and the Egyptians who were pursuing them.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:32.500
Exodus chapter 15 verses 20 and 21 tells what happened after this miraculous victory.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:43.500
Then Miriam, the prophetess, Aaron's sister, took a tambourine in her hand, and all the women followed her with tambourines and with dances.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:51.500
Miriam sang in response to the men, saying to Jehovah, for he has become highly exalted.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.500
The horse and its rider he has hurled into the sea.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.500
Picture that scene.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.500
There were an estimated three million people in the nation of Israel. Imagine.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:16.500
Out of that large number, all the women were dancing and singing praises to Jehovah. That was undoubtedly a large army.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.500
What a great shout of praise to Jehovah that was.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.500
Another example was when King Saul and his general David returned from victory over the Philistines.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:35.500
Let's read the account at 1 Samuel chapter 18 and verse 6.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:51.500
When David and the others would return from striking down the Philistines, the women would come out from all the cities of Israel with song and dances to meet King Saul with tambourines, with rejoicing and with lutes.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:04:01.500
Notice that the account says that the women came out of all the cities to greet them with music, song and dance.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:10.500
Occasions such as these were not simply expressions of rejoicing that originated with human emotion.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.500
Recall that under inspiration, David said, Jehovah gives the command.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.500
The women proclaiming the good news are a large army.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:28.500
Yes, and Jehovah value their expressions of praise just as he value the contributions of the men who had engaged in battle.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.500
What about today?

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:43.500
The report for the 2017 service year shows that there were over 8.3 million publishers proclaiming the good news throughout the earth.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:56.500
They remind that in most lands, it is not unusual for our dear sisters to make up over half of our special pioneers and nearly three quarters of those who serve in the regular pioneer work.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:06.500
In addition, many other sisters are wholeheartedly spreading the good news of the kingdom to the best of their ability within their circumstances.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:14.500
There are many single parent families where our sisters are providing materially and spiritually for their children.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:31.500
Many of our faithful single sisters are spending themselves in Jehovah's service in theocratic construction and maintenance work, Bethel service, and serving where the need is greater, which includes serving in foreign language fields.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:39.500
Faithful wives, loyally support their husbands as well as fulfill their own roles as preachers and teachers.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:45.500
Yes, how Jehovah must be pleased to see all of you who serve in various ways.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:54.500
And we're grateful for the warm spirit and positive influence our dear sisters have on our congregations.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:02.500
Clearly, Jehovah values this large army of sisters.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:08.500
But does he take note of the individual circumstances and sacrifices of each sister?

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.500
We do not have to wonder.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:20.500
By means of his word, Jehovah makes it evident that he sees and appreciates each of his servants.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:30.500
For example, did you notice when we read the scripture in Exodus chapter 15 that Miriam was described as a prophetess?

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:36.500
Evidently, she was privileged to be used as an instrument of divine communication.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:43.500
In some instances, this no doubt included singing songs that were inspired by Jehovah.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:48.500
Miriam was not the only one in the scriptures with this designation.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:57.500
Other women in the Bible records, such as Anna and Isaiah's wife, were also spoken of as prophetesses.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:04.500
In the book of Judges, another faithful servant, Deborah, is identified.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:12.500
Let's read Judges chapter 4 verses 4 and 5.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:19.500
Now, Deborah, a prophetess. The wife of Lapidoth was judging Israel at that time.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:26.500
She used to sit under Deborah's palm tree between Rayma and Bethel in the mountainous region of Ephraim.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.500
The Israelites would go up to her for judgment.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:39.819
Evidently, Deborah was assigned a subtle dispute that arose among Israelites by giving Jehovah's answer to problems that came up.

00:07:39.819 --> 00:07:48.819
Much later in Israel's history during the reign of faithful King Josiah, Holda served as a prophetess.

00:07:48.819 --> 00:08:00.819
At 2 Kings chapter 22 and verse 8, we read that while the temple was being repaired, the original book of the law was found.

00:08:00.819 --> 00:08:08.819
When it was read to Josiah, he was distraught at seeing how far off the nation had strayed from Jehovah's law.

00:08:08.819 --> 00:08:16.819
At verse 13, he directed the priest, the secretary, and other influential men.

00:08:16.819 --> 00:08:30.819
Go in choir of Jehovah in my behalf, in behalf of the people, and in behalf of all Judah concerning the words of this book that has been found.

00:08:30.819 --> 00:08:35.820
How did they accomplish this? Verse 14 continues.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:46.820
So, he'll chia the priest, a hikeum, ackbore, shafen, and aseah, went to Holda the prophetess.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:59.129
It's interesting that Jehovah uses faithful woman to convey his direction, and that prominent men in priests sought her divinely inspired advice.

00:08:59.129 --> 00:09:09.129
The Christian Greek scriptures, however, do not permit sisters to serve in such a capacity as did Deborah and other prophetesses in the nation of Israel.

00:09:09.129 --> 00:09:25.129
However, Titus chapter 2 verses 3 and 4 encourages older women to display spiritual qualities so that they may advise the younger women in spiritual matters.

00:09:25.129 --> 00:09:28.129
Let's read those verses.

00:09:28.129 --> 00:09:45.129
Likewise, let the older women be reverent in behavior, not slanderous, not enslaved to a lot of wine, teachers of what is good, so that they may advise the younger women to love their husbands, to love their children.

00:09:46.129 --> 00:09:57.379
How we appreciate the spiritually mature sisters among us who provide such fine assistance to younger sisters or those who are newer in the truth.

00:09:57.379 --> 00:10:11.379
However, today, Jehovah has delegated authority to men. They scripturally qualified to serve as elders and ministerial servants in order to serve, guide, and protect his people.

00:10:11.379 --> 00:10:29.379
It is obvious that this is not due to a lack of respect for the gifts of our sisters in the congregation. In fact, many responsible brothers will acknowledge that they have benefited from the experience and practical wisdom of our humble spiritually mature sisters.

00:10:29.379 --> 00:10:35.379
Finally, think of the outstanding faith of another woman mentioned in the Bible.

00:10:36.379 --> 00:10:43.379
Mary, what an awesome responsibility Jehovah entrusted her with.

00:10:43.379 --> 00:10:55.379
Mary, and raising his own son as a human, we can only imagine the thoughts that were going through her mind when she was told of this assignment.

00:10:55.379 --> 00:11:04.379
But the account in Luke, chapter 1, tells us much about her spirituality.

00:11:04.379 --> 00:11:15.379
In verse 38, after the angel Gabriel finished speaking with her, Mary's response was simply,

00:11:16.379 --> 00:11:24.379
Look, Jehovah's slave girl, may it happen to me according to your declaration.

00:11:24.379 --> 00:11:31.379
She must have wondered how Jehovah would accomplish these things, but she was humble and obedient.

00:11:31.379 --> 00:11:39.379
Faithful men such as Moses and Jeremiah hesitated when given the challenging assignment from God, not Mary.

00:11:39.379 --> 00:11:49.659
What a beautiful example she set for all of us, men and women. Clearly, Jehovah has always highly valued women.

00:11:49.659 --> 00:11:55.659
And we are privileged to serve today with millions of hardworking sisters.

00:11:55.659 --> 00:12:03.659
How pleased Jehovah must be to see dear sisters serving him humbly and faithfully.

00:12:04.659 --> 00:12:12.659
We urge you sisters, please, keep up your good work and continue to be a positive influence in the congregation.

00:12:12.659 --> 00:12:19.659
God has indeed granted you faithful women the privilege of participating in the fulfillment of the Psalmist words.

00:12:19.659 --> 00:12:26.659
Jehovah gives the command, the women proclaiming the good news are a large army.
