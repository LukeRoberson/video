00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.379
The Mozambique Special Convention is truly outstanding for so many different reasons.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.339
One thing that has made this convention unique is that we have so many courageous

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:34.659
brothers who have been in prison for their faith from Angola, Korea, Malawi, Zimbabwe,

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:39.619
and from some of the countries in Europe who had to really stand up and set an example.

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:45.700
And to have them all here with our courageous Mozambique and brothers has made this convention

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.820
so special.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.060
It is very encouraging to be at this special convention.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.780
We have spent 10 years in the re-education camps along with our brothers from Malawi

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.579
and we are at the same camp and today we are together at this special convention.

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:01.939
It's very encouraging.

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:08.019
In 1990 I was judged and condemned to 15 months of prison in Paris.

00:01:08.019 --> 00:01:10.019
We were about 100 brothers in prison.

00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:14.340
They tried to shame us but thanks to Jehovah we had courage.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.739
Today this beautiful convention fills us with even more courage.

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.340
I was one of the brothers saving us a bicycle career during the ban,

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.980
delivering literature long distances.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.180
It was a difficult week because the police were searching for us.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.099
Jehovah blessed us with courage, giving us a heart without fear.

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:40.719
Because of our Christian neutrality, we were imprisoned.

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:44.560
Although it was a difficult time, Jehovah gave us courage to endure.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.799
And now we are here together.

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.439
We really thank Jehovah for that.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.299
I was arrested and sentenced to six years in prison.

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:03.459
Despite all these difficulties, today I feel very happy, I feel very encouraged.

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:13.979
At this convention we released the Greek scriptures in Sua and Sena.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.590
Thank you very much Jehovah for this wonderful provision.

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:30.509
I will surely use it while speaking about Jehovah's name in Sua.

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:35.310
We are so happy to have this Bible in Sua language.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.870
It's easy to read and it will improve our family worship.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.710
Those are the first two local languages in Mozambique to receive any part of the New World Translation.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.949
So it was a very exciting day.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.699
This convention was tied into 18 locations in Mozambique.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.580
A total of 1,685 were baptized.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.509
I have faith in Jehovah and want to have a close relationship with them.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:17.229
Many have commented on the fact that among the 981 that were baptized in Maputo,

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:18.909
there were many young ones.

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:24.189
And it just shows that the families here in Mozambique are working very hard with their young ones

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:29.870
to help them to know Jehovah and love Jehovah and to know what it means to be courageous.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.780
To organize a special convention in Africa requires a lot of work and a lot of planning.

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:45.419
But you could truly see the blessing of Jehovah here because everything has gone so beautifully

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.860
and the delegates are so happy.

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:53.340
You can really feel that Jehovah's spirit is with us.

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:04.219
Before the work was banned in Mozambique, we used to sing to Jehovah.

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:07.659
At the camps, we continued to sing joyfully.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.259
Now with the special convention, we continue to sing to our delegates.

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:21.279
Many of the delegates commented that the favorite part of the convention was going out in the

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:27.439
ministry with the local brothers. Even though the brothers may have very limited resources,

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:32.319
they showed them tremendous hospitality. It made a huge impression.

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:37.600
Some of the delegates even said that when they go back, this is going to have a life-changing

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:49.019
effect on them. We want to assure these dear brothers and sisters that the governing body

00:04:49.019 --> 00:04:56.060
loves them. But greater than that, Jehovah God knows about them. He loves them. He's supporting them.
