00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:10.330
As we learned in our audio-jama, the Jews returned to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple in 537 BCE.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:19.829
And by 515 BCE, it was finally completed. However, the city's walls were still left in ruins.

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:29.329
Jehovah's time had now come to rebuild the walls, and he used the faithful man Nehemiah to take the lead in this work.

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:35.329
This would be a massive undertaking for the Jews. And once again, there were opposers.

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:41.329
Nehemiah told the nation of Israel that the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:47.329
How could he encourage them to be joyful despite all the opposition?

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:56.329
What lessons can we learn from their example? There are many, but here are three to think about as you watch.

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:05.329
What role did prayer play in helping Nehemiah to be a courageous person for Jehovah?

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:13.329
In addition to direct attacks, what schemes did the enemies employ to oppose the work?

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:19.329
Despite setbacks, what was Nehemiah's main source of joy?

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:28.329
Got it? Alright then. With that in mind, please sit back and enjoy the following video presentation.

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:35.379
The joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.

00:01:35.379 --> 00:01:47.769
It was a privilege to have a share in the restoration of Jehovah's worship.

00:01:47.769 --> 00:01:56.739
People know we rebuilt the wall, but there is so much more to the story.

00:01:56.739 --> 00:01:58.739
Let's start at the beginning.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:08.870
In the 20th year of King Arduzirksi's linger maintenance, I was in Shushan, the palace.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:26.030
I was cut bearer to the king. He trusted me with his life.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:35.590
Although I was far from Jerusalem, I found great joy just thinking about our people there, serving Jehovah.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:55.340
Until one day, when I received a visit from my brother Henei, that visit changed everything.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.340
What's going on Henei?

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.340
How are people? Not good.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.340
The conditions are disgraceful.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:14.189
The walls of Jerusalem are broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire.

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:15.189
What about the temple?

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:20.189
It stands, but the services are nothing but empty rituals.

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:25.189
Most of the people and the priests ignore God's law.

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:28.189
You have to return with us.

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:43.680
For days, my conscience plagued me.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:53.719
Would the king even allow me to go?

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:58.719
Our people had sinned by not keeping Jehovah's commandments.

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:05.719
But now I felt as if I were sinning, by not helping them in their time of need.

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:20.129
I begged Jehovah to grant me success.

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:24.129
Nirmaya, why are you so gloomy when you're not sick?

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:29.110
This can be nothing but gloominess of heart.

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.110
Why should I not look gloomy?

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.110
When this city, the place where my forefathers are buried lies in ruins.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.110
And its gates have been consumed by fire.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.110
Nirmaya, what is this?

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.110
Speak frankly, what are you seeking?

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:55.329
At once, I prayed to the God of the heavens, if it pleases the king.

00:04:55.329 --> 00:05:01.339
And if your servant has found favor with you, send me to Judah,

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:12.839
to the city where my forefathers are buried, and let me rebuild it.

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:14.839
You may go.

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:20.980
Jehovah was with us.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:27.980
The king gave me supplies, an army, and an appointment as governor.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:35.410
We were on our way to help rebuild Jerusalem's walls.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:06:30.310
I had seen a portion of the city, but it wasn't until I rose by night to inspect the walls.

00:06:30.310 --> 00:07:08.560
The Isod just how badly God's city had been treated, believe the destruction.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:22.259
The time had come to reveal Jehovah's purpose for Jerusalem.

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:24.259
I gathered the leaders.

00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:28.670
Who is this man?

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:32.670
I'm told he's Nehemiah, cut bare to the king.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.670
What does he want from us?

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:48.029
Men, the holy city is completely vulnerable.

00:07:48.029 --> 00:07:53.029
Let us rebuild the walls of Jerusalem so that this disgrace will not continue.

00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:55.029
But what will our neighbors think?

00:07:55.029 --> 00:07:58.029
Yes, we have many powerful enemies.

00:07:58.029 --> 00:08:03.029
Our disurxies commissioned me to rebuild the walls in the entire city.

00:08:03.029 --> 00:08:06.029
Didn't you see the horsemen he sent?

00:08:06.029 --> 00:08:10.029
And all the timber, he gave it all.

00:08:10.029 --> 00:08:13.029
Brothers, the good hand of our God was upon me.

00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:16.029
He is the one to fear, not men.

00:08:16.029 --> 00:08:19.029
He will give us success.

00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:32.559
Not everyone was happy that we had come to do something good for the people of Israel.

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:35.559
So that's what this Nehemiah is up to.

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:38.559
Hisham, do you see what I'm saying?

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:43.559
Without a wall, we can keep the Jews under control.

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:47.559
If they rebuild it, the Jews won't need our land or resources.

00:08:47.559 --> 00:08:49.559
That means he's planning to rebel.

00:08:49.559 --> 00:08:50.559
We can't let him.

00:08:50.559 --> 00:08:55.059
We must act and act together.

00:08:55.059 --> 00:08:56.059
Are you with me?

00:08:56.059 --> 00:09:00.500
You have my support.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.500
And mine, as always.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.500
Good.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:09.470
We must go to Jerusalem to keep an eye on Nehemiah.

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:15.470
The opposers wanted to maintain control and to profit from Jehovah's people.

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:18.470
They wasted a little time trying to intimidate us.

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:24.019
Who are these?

00:09:24.019 --> 00:09:28.620
That's Sam Ballet, governor of Samaria.

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:32.860
Next to him is Tobiah, an Ammonite official.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.860
Land owner to many of our people.

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.860
They'll look up to him.

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:37.860
That's Hisham.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.860
He's a very wealthy Arabian and close ally to Sam Ballet.

00:09:41.860 --> 00:10:00.649
Nehemiah, are you rebellion against the king?

00:10:00.649 --> 00:10:02.649
The king himself gives us the authority.

00:10:02.649 --> 00:10:04.649
To rebuild the city and the wall?

00:10:04.649 --> 00:10:07.649
To rebuild the city and the wall is what the king expects us to do.

00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:09.649
Why did you not consult with me?

00:10:09.649 --> 00:10:12.649
I am the governor of Samaria.

00:10:12.649 --> 00:10:15.649
Well, yes, but the king appointed Nehemiah as governor of Judah.

00:10:15.649 --> 00:10:17.649
So why have you not asked for our help?

00:10:17.649 --> 00:10:19.649
We worship Jehovah too.

00:10:19.649 --> 00:10:21.649
We sacrifice to him for generations.

00:10:21.649 --> 00:10:24.649
Along with sacrifices to all of your other gods.

00:10:24.649 --> 00:10:28.649
The God of the heavens is the one that will grant us success.

00:10:28.649 --> 00:10:32.649
And we his servants, we will get up and build.

00:10:32.649 --> 00:10:37.649
No one should let his religious beliefs come before national unity.

00:10:37.649 --> 00:10:42.649
But you have neither share nor claim nor memorial in Jerusalem.

00:10:51.299 --> 00:10:58.279
Sam Ballet, could it be you who is rebelling against the highest king of all?

00:10:58.279 --> 00:11:09.059
Despite opposition, the people work strenuously.

00:11:09.059 --> 00:11:32.769
Their struggles went far beyond building a wall.

00:11:32.769 --> 00:11:35.769
Jehovah remembers brothers like Peelef,

00:11:35.769 --> 00:11:40.769
seeing how he dealt with personal challenges, strength in my faith.

00:11:40.769 --> 00:11:48.419
Peelef, right here.

00:11:48.419 --> 00:11:51.419
We'll never finish this work. It's not about rubble.

00:11:52.419 --> 00:11:54.419
They swear trying to make a change.

00:11:54.419 --> 00:11:57.419
Always an optimist.

00:11:57.419 --> 00:12:00.419
By the way, you're late on your rent.

00:12:00.419 --> 00:12:02.419
Again.

00:12:02.419 --> 00:12:04.419
Rayham, I'm sorry.

00:12:04.419 --> 00:12:06.419
I need more time.

00:12:06.419 --> 00:12:07.419
With the work on the wall.

00:12:07.419 --> 00:12:09.419
I don't have enough troubles.

00:12:09.419 --> 00:12:13.419
Look, if I don't get payment by the end of the month, you and your family are out.

00:12:13.419 --> 00:12:20.179
Is there anything we can do?

00:12:20.179 --> 00:12:22.179
Maybe I can work it off.

00:12:22.179 --> 00:12:23.179
Do we get caught off?

00:12:23.179 --> 00:12:28.580
Seriously, you don't have time to work it off.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.580
But maybe your daughter can help.

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:33.580
She can come stay with us.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:34.580
Is it slave?

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:39.580
No, I'll hire her to help Azuba, to pay off your debt.

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:43.580
Look, I'm trying to help, but you don't have many options to have my friend.

00:12:43.580 --> 00:13:14.059
Think about it.

00:13:14.059 --> 00:13:17.059
So, Rayham spoke to me today.

00:13:17.059 --> 00:13:18.059
About what?

00:13:18.059 --> 00:13:22.059
He wants to hire Simka to help Azuba in the house.

00:13:22.059 --> 00:13:26.789
And he says he'll care for her like his own daughter.

00:13:26.789 --> 00:13:31.789
Ema, I've known Rayham and Azuba ever since I came here with Ezra.

00:13:31.789 --> 00:13:34.789
Rayham helped us.

00:13:34.789 --> 00:13:36.789
Our house belongs to him.

00:13:36.789 --> 00:13:37.789
I don't trust him.

00:13:37.789 --> 00:13:40.789
He wants our Simka to live with him?

00:13:40.789 --> 00:13:41.789
Ema.

00:13:41.789 --> 00:13:43.789
What about Jehovah's Command?

00:13:43.789 --> 00:13:45.789
Their parents raised their own children.

00:13:45.789 --> 00:13:54.519
Don't you want her to have a better life?

00:13:54.519 --> 00:13:56.519
I cannot agree.

00:13:56.519 --> 00:13:58.519
To having her live apart from us.

00:13:58.519 --> 00:14:00.519
Even if we have to survive on cleanings.

00:14:00.519 --> 00:14:02.519
Yeah, they know we'll survive it all.

00:14:02.519 --> 00:14:08.379
Because Jehovah always takes care of those who love and obey him.

00:14:08.379 --> 00:14:16.600
Men like Pilith, through their burden on Jehovah, and kept working.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:34.120
Sinballah set up camp near Jerusalem to keep an eye on our progress.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:42.970
So, what is it?

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:43.970
My lord.

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:47.970
Yes, the wall. It's up to half its height all around the city.

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.970
This has gone too far.

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:51.970
Gisham.

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:54.970
How long will it take to assemble an attack force?

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:56.970
Attack force.

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:58.970
My lord, Simballah.

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:00.970
An attack on the Jews.

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:02.970
Being an attack on the king.

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:03.970
What are you talking about?

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:04.970
He's right.

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:07.970
Nehmaya has authorization from Artyxerxes himself.

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:09.970
You saw how many horsemen the king sent with him.

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:10.970
Yes.

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:12.970
Would you be talking like this if those horsemen were still here?

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:13.970
And they can't come back.

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:14.970
Nonsense.

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:17.970
Never mind the horsemen.

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:19.970
This is my province.

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:22.970
Out here, I decide what to do.

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:25.970
Now, we need to threaten them.

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:28.970
Gisham, you bring Samaritan troops.

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:31.970
They're prepared to attack us.

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:33.970
How do you know that?

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:35.970
I heard them talking.

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:37.970
Brothers, please.

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:39.970
Have they attacked anyone yet?

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:41.970
They must have.

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:44.970
Are you going to wait until they start killing us?

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:45.970
Of course not.

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:52.740
Of course not.

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:53.740
Henei.

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:58.529
Postmen by families at the lowest parts of the wall.

00:15:58.529 --> 00:16:00.529
At all the exposed places.

00:16:00.529 --> 00:16:02.840
Yes, Nehmaya.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:06.840
Brothers, if we let mere threats frighten us into stopping,

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:07.840
they will have achieved their goal.

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.840
It's no use. Don't you see these people hate what we're doing?

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:11.840
They hate us.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.840
You don't have to live and work around them like we do.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.840
Brothers, where is your faith?

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.840
It is Jehovah's will that we build this wall.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.840
It's really Jehovah's will and why are we getting all this opposition?

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.840
Maybe this isn't the right time.

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:29.840
Besides, this work is too much for us. We're worn out.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.840
Why do we need a wall anyway?

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:37.899
To protect Jehovah's people.

00:16:37.899 --> 00:16:47.179
Brothers, do not be afraid of them.

00:16:47.179 --> 00:16:52.179
Remember Jehovah who is great and awe-inspiring.

00:16:52.179 --> 00:16:56.840
And fight for your brothers.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.840
Your sons and daughters.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:02.759
Your wives and homes.

00:17:02.759 --> 00:17:09.089
So when you hear the sound of the horn,

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:12.089
gather together to where we are.

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:15.089
Our God will fight for us.

00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:19.170
Listen for this signal.

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:30.230
The threats are working.

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:33.230
Next sound they hear will be our battle cry.

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:36.230
Wait, we already spoke about this.

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:39.230
A direct attack would be seditious.

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:41.230
Besides, they've armed themselves.

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:47.869
Wait.

00:17:47.869 --> 00:17:49.869
I, I, I, Lord.

00:17:49.869 --> 00:17:51.869
Keishan's right.

00:17:51.869 --> 00:17:53.869
It would never get away with this.

00:17:53.869 --> 00:17:56.869
Don't you recall who commissioned Nehemiah?

00:17:56.869 --> 00:17:57.869
It was the King.

00:17:57.869 --> 00:17:58.869
The King of Persia.

00:17:58.869 --> 00:18:00.869
Let me remind you.

00:18:00.869 --> 00:18:03.869
Nehemiah setting himself up as a king.

00:18:03.869 --> 00:18:16.089
I recommend you turn the accusation of sedition against Nehemiah.

00:18:16.089 --> 00:18:18.089
That's brilliant.

00:18:19.089 --> 00:18:21.089
Yes.

00:18:21.089 --> 00:18:23.089
You will beg for our help.

00:18:23.089 --> 00:19:03.140
Let's go back to Samaria.

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.140
You look like you've been working.

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:09.140
Almost not like it, too.

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:10.140
Yes.

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:13.640
Yes, you do.

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.529
Brothers.

00:19:16.529 --> 00:19:20.529
Brothers, we are well on our way to completing the wall.

00:19:20.529 --> 00:19:22.529
Jehovah's helping us.

00:19:22.529 --> 00:19:25.529
But we must not let our hands drop.

00:19:25.529 --> 00:19:29.799
From now on,

00:19:29.799 --> 00:19:32.799
we will all spend the night inside Jerusalem.

00:19:32.799 --> 00:19:34.799
We will take turns keeping watch.

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:37.799
And a night we'll give out assignments.

00:19:37.799 --> 00:19:38.799
Good work today.

00:19:38.799 --> 00:20:24.799
Looking hard on the wall.

00:20:24.799 --> 00:20:30.799
More issues to contend with.

00:20:30.799 --> 00:20:31.799
My brothers.

00:20:31.799 --> 00:20:35.079
How can I help you?

00:20:35.079 --> 00:20:36.079
Nehemiah.

00:20:36.079 --> 00:20:39.079
We, with our sons and daughters, are many.

00:20:39.079 --> 00:20:41.079
We need food to stay alive.

00:20:41.079 --> 00:20:46.619
We gave our fields and vineyards and houses

00:20:46.619 --> 00:20:49.619
as security to get grain during the food shortage.

00:20:49.619 --> 00:20:52.619
We borrowed money on our fields and our vineyards

00:20:52.619 --> 00:20:55.619
to pay the king's tribute.

00:20:55.619 --> 00:20:58.619
And we've had to sell some of our children at the slavery.

00:20:58.619 --> 00:21:00.619
And we're powerless to stop this

00:21:00.619 --> 00:21:03.619
because our fields and vineyards belong to others.

00:21:03.619 --> 00:21:08.660
Thank you for bringing this to my attention.

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:10.660
I must ponder all this.

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:11.660
Thank you, Nehemiah.

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:20.619
Haneena, please tell all the nobles and deputy rulers

00:21:20.619 --> 00:21:23.619
to come to me first thing tomorrow morning.

00:21:23.619 --> 00:21:26.619
With God's help, we can make this right.

00:21:42.299 --> 00:21:46.549
Men of Judah, each of you is demanding interest

00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:48.549
from your brother.

00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:51.549
You should be shamed of yourselves.

00:21:51.549 --> 00:21:54.549
Should you not walk in the fear of our God

00:21:54.549 --> 00:21:57.549
so that the nations, our enemies,

00:21:57.549 --> 00:21:59.549
cannot reproach us?

00:21:59.549 --> 00:22:03.549
Let us please stop this blending on interest.

00:22:03.549 --> 00:22:07.549
Please restore to them their fields, vineyards,

00:22:07.549 --> 00:22:10.549
all of groves and houses,

00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:12.549
and the interest.

00:22:12.549 --> 00:22:20.819
Nehemiah, I will restore the fields this day at sunset.

00:22:20.819 --> 00:22:28.150
We all will restore these things to our brothers.

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:32.150
Before Jehovah, do you swear to these promises?

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:34.150
We do.

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:37.150
May the true God shake out from his house

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:41.150
every man who does not carry out this promise.

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:48.180
Amen.

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:55.700
We best inform Tobiah about this.

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:57.700
This will be successful.

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:12.180
Jehovah will bless.

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:13.180
Now bring your news.

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:14.180
Is that so?

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:16.180
Yes.

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:18.180
We have your rent.

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:23.180
Well, come by any time and collect it.

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:25.180
But I thought we...

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:27.180
I think what about Simka?

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:35.269
She'll be staying with us.

00:23:35.269 --> 00:23:39.269
Well, how are you able to put it together so quickly?

00:23:39.269 --> 00:23:45.250
Jehovah always takes care of those who love and obey him.

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:47.250
Ever since Nehemiah got here,

00:23:47.250 --> 00:24:04.769
things have been getting better and better.

00:24:04.769 --> 00:24:08.769
Me and my thanks were still as young as when we came here with Ezra.

00:24:08.769 --> 00:24:12.109
I've worked hard.

00:24:12.109 --> 00:24:14.109
But now Nehemiah treats us like it all fell out of heaven,

00:24:14.109 --> 00:24:16.109
and we just had to pick it up.

00:24:16.109 --> 00:24:18.109
I've worked hard for what I have.

00:24:18.109 --> 00:24:19.109
Didn't I?

00:24:19.109 --> 00:24:20.109
Yes, you worked hard.

00:24:20.109 --> 00:24:23.109
If I get back my fields, what am I to eat?

00:24:23.109 --> 00:24:24.109
What am I to drink?

00:24:24.109 --> 00:24:26.109
What's wrong with lending on interest?

00:24:26.109 --> 00:24:29.109
You borrow, you pay, with interest.

00:24:29.109 --> 00:24:30.109
Where are you?

00:24:30.109 --> 00:24:33.109
Jehovah just wants us to treat our brothers fairly.

00:24:33.109 --> 00:24:34.109
Have you heard a word I said?

00:24:34.109 --> 00:24:36.109
I treat everyone fairly.

00:24:36.109 --> 00:24:43.380
Where are you so angry?

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:47.750
I'm not angry.

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:49.750
Why are you talking to me like this?

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:51.750
I just feel betrayed.

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:56.089
By the people I've lent money to.

00:24:56.089 --> 00:25:01.190
What can I do about it?

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:04.190
Only what a wife is supposed to do?

00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:06.190
Give me a son!

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:08.190
If not a son, then a daughter.

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:13.200
I cannot give you.

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.200
Which Jehovah does not give us.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.200
One day, it will be too late.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:35.150
See what the boy reports when he returns.

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:37.150
My lord, St. Ballet.

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:38.150
Now what?

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:40.150
The wall has no more gaps.

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:41.150
What?

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:47.099
How can they advance so quickly?

00:25:47.099 --> 00:25:50.099
Also, there's a letter for Tobaya.

00:25:50.099 --> 00:26:08.250
Nehemiah is forcing landlords to return their fields

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:10.250
to the original owners.

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:11.250
We're running out of time.

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:12.250
Enough.

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:21.200
Tell this to Nehemiah.

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.200
Come.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:25.200
And let us set a time to meet together

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:29.609
in the valley plain of Ono.

00:26:29.609 --> 00:26:39.859
They're trying to lure me away from Jerusalem.

00:26:39.859 --> 00:26:41.859
Please tell your master.

00:26:41.859 --> 00:26:44.859
I'm engaged in a great work, and I'm not able to go down.

00:26:44.859 --> 00:26:48.859
Why should the work stop while I leave it to come to you?

00:26:48.859 --> 00:26:51.859
They sent me the same message several times.

00:26:51.859 --> 00:26:57.099
Each time I gave them the same response.

00:26:57.099 --> 00:27:06.980
He has rejected your offer a fourth time.

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:17.319
Geesham, it's time to implement your plan.

00:27:17.319 --> 00:27:20.319
Tobaya, write this down.

00:27:20.319 --> 00:27:24.319
Among the nations, it has been heard.

00:27:24.319 --> 00:27:29.319
And Geesham is also saying that you and the Jews

00:27:29.319 --> 00:27:32.319
are scheming to rebel.

00:27:32.319 --> 00:27:54.750
That is why you are building the wall.

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:55.750
Yes?

00:27:55.750 --> 00:28:22.230
Give this to Nehemiah.

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:23.230
Tell your master.

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:26.230
None of the things you are saying have taken place.

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:29.230
You are making them up out of your own imagination.

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:52.059
They're bluffing.

00:28:52.059 --> 00:28:55.059
They're trying to frighten us and is stopping the work.

00:28:55.059 --> 00:28:59.059
Yes, they know that the king won't change his decree.

00:28:59.059 --> 00:29:26.990
But believe me, they won't stop.

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:32.990
Jehovah, I pray strengthen my hands.

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:38.329
What can we do to stop him?

00:29:38.329 --> 00:29:40.329
We don't have much time.

00:29:40.329 --> 00:29:43.329
The wall is almost complete.

00:29:43.329 --> 00:29:51.220
San Ballet.

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:53.220
I think I know a way.

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:55.220
Shemaya, you call for me?

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:57.220
Yes.

00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:02.579
You are in great danger.

00:30:02.579 --> 00:30:03.579
And so am I.

00:30:03.579 --> 00:30:04.579
Because I know about it.

00:30:04.579 --> 00:30:05.579
Talk sense, man.

00:30:05.579 --> 00:30:06.579
What danger?

00:30:06.579 --> 00:30:07.579
They're coming to kill you.

00:30:07.579 --> 00:30:12.579
By night, we must go into the temple and close the doors.

00:30:12.579 --> 00:30:14.579
Shemaya.

00:30:14.579 --> 00:30:16.579
Should a man like me run away?

00:30:16.579 --> 00:30:17.579
You don't understand.

00:30:17.579 --> 00:30:18.579
No.

00:30:18.579 --> 00:30:21.579
What would that do to the spirit of the entire nation?

00:30:21.579 --> 00:30:23.579
It's the only safe place.

00:30:23.579 --> 00:30:25.579
Besides, I'm not a priest.

00:30:25.579 --> 00:30:29.579
If I entered the temple, that would be Valhri's in a kill me.

00:30:29.579 --> 00:30:31.579
I will not go in.

00:30:31.579 --> 00:30:41.170
That decision would be foolish, Nehemiah.

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:42.170
Oh, I see.

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:46.170
Tobaya and San Ballet put you up to this.

00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:48.170
Didn't they, you hypocrite?

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:50.170
Made Jehovah remember them?

00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:54.170
And all of you false prophets who keep trying to frighten me.

00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:55.170
Come, Henei.

00:30:55.170 --> 00:31:14.319
We have work to do.

00:31:14.319 --> 00:31:17.319
We just kept working day and night.

00:31:17.319 --> 00:31:19.319
But before we knew it,

00:31:19.319 --> 00:31:22.319
we were finishing the very last section of the wall.

00:31:22.319 --> 00:31:39.200
It helped us to achieve the impossible.

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:48.210
We were tired.

00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:51.210
But we discovered something we had lost.

00:31:51.210 --> 00:32:06.619
It's 52 days.

00:32:06.619 --> 00:32:15.690
It's from Shemaya.

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:31.730
What does it say?

00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:46.539
The wall is complete.

00:32:46.539 --> 00:32:49.849
George left me put in.

00:32:49.849 --> 00:32:51.849
San Ballet, we must act quickly.

00:32:51.849 --> 00:32:53.849
San Ballet.

00:32:53.849 --> 00:32:55.849
Tobaya.

00:32:55.849 --> 00:32:57.849
There's still time.

00:32:57.849 --> 00:32:59.849
Write that letter to the God.

00:32:59.849 --> 00:33:03.319
Don't you see?

00:33:03.319 --> 00:33:09.829
God must be helping the Jews.

00:33:09.829 --> 00:33:11.829
It's over.

00:33:11.829 --> 00:33:13.829
We'll lose all control over them.

00:33:13.829 --> 00:33:18.900
This isn't over.

00:33:18.900 --> 00:34:16.860
We would definitely need God's help for what was coming next.
