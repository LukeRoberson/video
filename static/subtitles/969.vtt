00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:09.939
The title of this series of four talks is Seek, Peace, and Persuad, and it's based on 1 Peter chapter 3 and verse 11.

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:11.939
Let's read that together.

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:17.510
1 Peter chapter 3 and verse 11.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.510
Let him turn away from what is bad and do what is good.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.510
Let him seek peace and pursue it.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.509
Yes, we have to pursue peace and pursuit requires effort.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:38.509
Have you ever had to chase a piece of paper that was in your hands and got blown away by the wind?

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:42.509
And just when you get to it, the wind blows it away again and again.

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:48.509
It can really take quite some effort to retrieve and get that paper back in your hands.

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:56.509
Just standing there and watching the paper blow further and further away is not going to get it back.

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:59.509
Well, peace can be a lot like that paper.

00:00:59.509 --> 00:01:09.510
At some point, it can get blown away and we have to then chase or pursue it to get that piece back again.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.510
This series of talks will help us to pursue peace in four ways.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:25.510
By not quickly taking offense, by apologizing, by forgiving freely, and by using our gift of speech wisely.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.109
Let's consider our first way to pursue peace.

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:35.109
Avoid quickly taking offense.

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:41.109
Now, because we are imperfect, we might misjudge others and quickly take offense.

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:46.109
Notice that we say, quickly take offense. That's an important word.

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:52.109
We need to avoid jumping to conclusions quickly before we actually have the facts.

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:58.459
Even faithful men like Jesus apostles have taken offense too quickly.

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:04.459
You may recall the time that Jesus and His apostles were looking for lodging in a Samaritan village.

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:09.460
Now, the Samaritans in that village rudely denied them lodging.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:17.460
At Luke 9 verses 54 through 56, the apostles James and John say to Jesus,

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:23.460
Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven and annihilate them?

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.699
But Jesus rebukes them for their rash and rather violent suggestion.

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:36.699
Think of the serious consequences had Jesus yielded to the violent temper of James and John.

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:41.699
The Samaritans could have become prejudiced against the kingdom message.

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:50.699
Instead, Jesus pursues a peaceful solution. The account says they simply went to a different village.

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:54.699
Now, does this mean we're saying I can never take offense?

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:58.699
No, you may have a legitimate cause for complaint.

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:06.699
The key point is that we should not quickly draw conclusions before we hear all the facts.

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:10.699
Proverbs chapter 18 and verse 13 says,

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:17.699
When anyone replies to a matter before he hears the facts, it is foolish and humiliating.

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:24.949
In the following dramatization, know what helps one sister to overlook an offense.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.520
And I expected more from you.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.520
Hey Lee, what are you talking about? Got a pin.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.520
About my posts.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.520
Are you that lonely?

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.979
You've got nothing better to do.

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:47.659
Hey Lee.

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:49.659
Wait, please.

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:51.659
I don't know what's happening.

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:54.659
Did you talk to Emily about my posts?

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:55.659
Yes, we do.

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:56.659
Do you want to sit about me?

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:59.659
No, why would I look up to you?

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:03.659
You're supposed to be the mature one and you're just like Emily, busy running your mind.

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:05.659
Hey Lee.

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:08.659
Look, I can see you're upset.

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:11.659
But trust me, this is a huge misunderstanding.

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:17.660
I love you.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.660
I would never, ever say anything behind your back.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.660
So please calm down.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:34.779
Sometimes I just feel so alone.

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:43.540
Between Nana and work.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.540
And then knowing all of you were talking about me.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.540
I promise, that's not what happened.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:56.040
You're just really tired and overwhelmed.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:02.300
So why don't we just slow things down, little?

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.300
You know, meetings always make me feel better.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.300
Even on my worst days.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.300
Why don't we go inside?

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.300
Clean up a little, enjoy the program together.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.300
Then afterwards, we can all talk.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.300
I promise, it'll be okay.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:30.709
Hey Lee really was upset.

00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:36.709
She'd already concluded that she was being gossiped about by everyone.

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:44.709
If we find ourselves like Hey Lee feeling offended, how can we avoid quickly taking offense?

00:05:44.709 --> 00:05:48.709
Well, we must stop and think.

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:54.709
Let's read Ecclesiastes chapter 7 and verse 9 for some very good advice in these situations.

00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:58.709
Ecclesiastes chapter 7 and verse 9.

00:05:58.709 --> 00:06:01.709
Do not be quick to take offense.

00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:08.019
For the taking of offense lodges in the bosom of fools.

00:06:08.019 --> 00:06:14.019
Like Celia said in the parking lot to Hey Lee, please calm down.

00:06:14.019 --> 00:06:21.019
So in those situations, we need to think about what you know and just as importantly what you don't know.

00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:27.019
Now, you know what you were told happened, but what was really said?

00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:31.019
In the video, Hey Lee quickly believed what she was told.

00:06:31.019 --> 00:06:35.019
She did not even ask Celia what she really said.

00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:42.339
Or you may know what was said, but do you know what was really meant by it?

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:45.339
Hey Lee asked, did you talk about my posts?

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:47.339
And Celia said yes.

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:51.680
And immediately, Hey Lee assumed the worst.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.680
Or perhaps we misjudged the person who heard us.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:02.680
Hey Lee misjudged Celia on the spot by saying, you're just as bad as Emily.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.680
She had not even heard from Celia yet.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.680
Hey Lee said to Celia, she was the mature one, the one she looked up to.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.680
And yet she was quick to believe the worst about her.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.680
Hey Lee had not stopped and really thought about what she was thinking and saying.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:24.250
Perhaps she was having a hard day.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:28.250
Well, Celia really set a fine example for us.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.250
Even though Hey Lee spoke harshly to her,

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.250
Celia was calm and listened to Hey Lee.

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:39.250
As Hey Lee explained how she was feeling lonely, dealing and caring for her grandmother,

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:43.250
you can see the love and concern that Celia had for Hey Lee.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:49.250
Even though just moments before, she had spoken really harshly to her.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:53.250
Well, besides taking time to think things through,

00:07:53.250 --> 00:08:00.250
we also need to remember that it is Jehovah's opinion of us that matters the most.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:07.250
Now, that's an important point, especially when we deal with misunderstandings or false accusations.

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.250
Think about it.

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:13.250
Jehovah is an eyewitness to everything.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:16.250
Dilustrate that I want you to imagine.

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.250
You had a traffic accident.

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:21.250
Now, you were just sitting at the stop sign,

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:25.250
but another car ran straight into you.

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:31.250
The police come and the person that ran into you says that you ran into them.

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:34.250
And the police believed them.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.250
You take the matter to court.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:42.250
The judge listens, as the other person says, that you ran into them.

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:46.250
However, before you can say anything, the judge says,

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.250
no, that is not what happened.

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:53.250
I was there walking on the sidewalk across the street that day,

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:55.250
and I saw the whole thing.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:09:03.590
Well, it's extremely unlikely that you can go to court and expect the judge for your case to have been an eyewitness.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:12.590
This does illustrate, though, the peace of mind that we can have knowing that Jehovah is an eyewitness to all that happens.

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:18.590
So when falsely accused, or we have a misunderstanding that we cannot seem to clear up,

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:26.590
it is of great comfort for us to know that Jehovah was there that day and saw the whole thing.

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:34.220
We don't need to take offense at every negative thing that is said or done around us.

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:40.220
Or feel we have to defend ourselves as right on every occasion.

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:48.570
We would surely wear out emotionally and probably not have very many friends.

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:53.570
We should be willing to overlook minor transgressions.

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:58.570
Let's look at Proverbs 19 and verse 11.

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:01.570
Proverbs 19 and verse 11.

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:04.570
What can help us?

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:15.570
Insight of a man certainly slows down his anger, and it is beauty on his part to overlook an offense.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:19.570
So can you overlook an offense?

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:23.570
As the Proverbs said, that is beauty on our part.

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:30.570
If not, and you have a serious cause for complaint, handle matters according to Jehovah's direction,

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:39.570
show insight, slow down any anger, think carefully and listen patiently

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:47.200
to make sure you clearly have all the facts before you become offended or take action.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:52.200
Remember that piece of paper that you had in your hands and got blown away by the wind?

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.200
What if it was a hundred dollar bill?

00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:02.200
Well, you would make every effort to pursue it and get it back because it's valuable.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:07.200
Our piece with our brothers is far more valuable than paper money.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:14.200
When our piece with our brothers or sisters is blown away by misunderstandings, mistakes, or sin,

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:18.200
then you should pursue peace, try hard to get it back.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:27.740
Yes, we glorify God and promote peace when we avoid quickly taking offense.

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:35.080
Brother Ralph Walls, a helper to the Personnel Committee, will now present the next talk of this symposium,

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:39.080
seek peace and pursue it by apologizing.
