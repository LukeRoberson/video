00:00:02.509 --> 00:00:09.210
During his earthly ministry, Jesus miraculously healed many sick or disabled persons.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.710
At times, he would say to such ones, the expression we find at Matthew 9.29,

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.250
according to your faith, let it happen to you.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.390
The principle of what Jesus stated applies in every aspect of our Christian life and ministry.

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:33.789
But today, we would discuss how this principle that faith in Jehovah makes things happen

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:36.289
can work for us in three areas.

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:43.090
We will see, number one, how our faith has made positive things happen in our personal life.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:51.590
Two, how we can accomplish things in God's service that would not be possible without faith in Jehovah God.

00:00:51.689 --> 00:01:00.189
And three, how faith moves us to step out of our comfort zone to do more in Jehovah's service.

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:08.189
The principle faith in Jehovah makes things happen is well illustrated in one of the miracles Jesus performed.

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:16.790
Please open your Bible to Mark chapter 5 and let's read verses 25 to 29.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.189
Now, there was a woman who had had a flow of blood for 12 years.

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:28.189
She had suffered much at the hands of many physicians and had spent all her resources.

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.890
And she was no better, but rather had become worse.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:41.090
When she heard the reports about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his outer garment.

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:48.590
For she kept saying, if I touch just his outer garments, I will get well.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:58.489
And immediately her flow of blood dried up and she sensed in her body that she had been healed of the grievous sickness.

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:04.590
In the following verses, Jesus asked who had touched him, the woman then reveals before the crowd,

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.090
but she had done and how she'd been cured.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.689
Now, notice Jesus' response in verse 34.

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:15.189
He said to her,

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:16.389
daughter,

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:19.289
your faith has made you well.

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:23.889
Go in peace and be healed from your grievous sickness.

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:31.090
What comforting words Jesus spoke to this trembling woman, your faith has made you well.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.090
What did Jesus mean?

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.889
Let's examine the account more closely.

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:40.689
It says that the woman heard reports about Jesus.

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:45.590
Many others heard the same reports, but not all put faith in Jesus.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.389
And think of the circumstances that could have prevented her from even coming to Jesus.

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:56.289
She had been disappointed many times over the past 12 years.

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:59.889
She might well have thought, what's the use?

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.289
I'm tired and weak and poor.

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:05.189
I am staying home.

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:09.990
Or I would like for Jesus to see me, but there is such a crowd.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.590
How will I ever get through to him?

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.289
And after all, I'm in an unclean state.

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:19.990
And if the people discover this, perhaps they will punish me.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:26.590
No, she did not allow these negative thoughts or doubts to fill her mind.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.090
She left her home.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.789
She found Jesus despite the large crowd.

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:33.789
And what was she saying?

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:40.289
Did she say, if I touched just his outer garments, maybe I will get well?

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:44.789
No, she said, I will get well.

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:49.090
Now, it was not the case that her faith healed her.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.189
No, but her faith moved her to come to Jesus.

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:58.490
And she was healed by the power from Jehovah that flowed through his Son.

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:04.069
Faith to approach Jesus made it happen for her.

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:13.569
If you are a dedicated baptized Christian, don't you agree that your faith has already made positive things happen in your personal life?

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.569
No, you were not miraculously healed of your physical sicknesses.

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:23.970
We look forward to physical healing of our eels during the thousand-year reign of Christ.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:30.269
But today, Jesus Christ directs a program of spiritual healing.

00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:36.970
When we were a part of this godless world, many of us were sick, spiritually, morally, and emotionally.

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.470
No one could cure us.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:49.670
Perhaps we desperately tried material things or pleasures to feel our spiritual need, but our condition only got worse.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:54.970
We were helpless and hopeless, but then we heard reports.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.670
The good news of God's kingdom under Christ.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.769
We studied the Bible.

00:05:00.769 --> 00:05:08.269
Our faith moved us to make positive changes in our life and to associate with the Christian congregation.

00:05:08.269 --> 00:05:12.970
Today, we enjoy good spiritual health and happiness.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.279
Our faith has made it happen.

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:25.579
Faith has also made it possible to accomplish things in God's service that perhaps we never thought we could do.

00:05:25.579 --> 00:05:30.879
Please open your Bibles to Hebrews chapter 11.

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:35.980
In this portion of Paul's letter to the Hebrews, he focuses on faith.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:42.279
It begins with a definition of faith, but then starting in verse four,

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:50.779
Paul acts as a sort of tour guide walking us through the corridor of thousands of years of Bible history.

00:05:50.779 --> 00:06:00.879
He stops along the way to point out the extraordinary things that men and women of the past did by means of faith in Jehovah God.

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:10.180
Just glance down the columns in this chapter and notice how Paul introduces each paragraph with the words

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.980
by faith.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:20.980
This expression by faith appears 18 times in this one chapter.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:25.779
Now, when we look at the names Paul lists in this chapter,

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:30.779
we may think, well, these were spiritual giants.

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:37.579
But in reality, they were ordinary humans with weaknesses like all of us have today.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:47.980
The thing they all had in common was faith and faith in Jehovah made it possible for them to do amazing things.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:56.180
Let's look at some of them and compare what they did with what many of you are doing today by faith.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.379
Let's read verse five.

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:09.879
By faith, Enoch was transferred so as not to see death and he was nowhere to be found because God had transferred him.

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:16.379
For before he was transferred, he received the witness that he had pleased God well.

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:27.480
The book of Jude verses 14 and 15 informs us that Enoch boldly proclaimed that Jehovah was going to destroy that ungodly world.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:34.579
It appears that wicked, violent men were going to take Enoch's life because of his bold witness.

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:47.430
So God chose to take him that is gently cutting short his life, sparing him the pangs of a violent death in modern times like Enoch.

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:54.529
Many brothers and sisters have boldly declared God's judgments even when faced with death.

00:07:54.629 --> 00:08:04.629
One brother after receiving a death sentence at Nazi hands during World War II wrote these words shortly before his execution.

00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:12.529
I have such peace, such tranquility that you can't possibly imagine.

00:08:12.529 --> 00:08:17.529
Faith made such boldness and calmness possible.

00:08:17.529 --> 00:08:23.329
In many ways, you very likely have shown the same faith as Enoch.

00:08:23.329 --> 00:08:30.529
By faith, you stand up to an ungodly world by not adopting its corrupt ways.

00:08:30.529 --> 00:08:37.129
By faith, you boldly declared God's word from house to house and in public places.

00:08:37.129 --> 00:08:45.230
Before you became a baptized witness, you may have thought you would never do this preaching work, but you are doing it.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:53.230
Sometimes, even in the face of verbal abuse and opposition, faith has made it happen.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.929
Let's read verse 7.

00:08:55.929 --> 00:09:07.330
By faith Noah, after receiving divine warning of things not yet seen, showed godly fear and constructed an ark for the saving of his household.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:15.529
And through this faith, he condemned the world and he became an heir of the righteousness that results from faith.

00:09:15.629 --> 00:09:24.029
Nothing in the Bible indicates that Jehovah chose Noah to construct an ark because he was an experienced builder.

00:09:24.029 --> 00:09:31.429
Certainly, he never had built such a gigantic vessel as what Jehovah'd asked him to construct.

00:09:31.429 --> 00:09:34.529
Noah likely pondered many questions.

00:09:34.529 --> 00:09:37.629
How will I get all the building materials?

00:09:37.629 --> 00:09:40.830
Do I have the right tools to do the job?

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.629
How will I gather all the animals?

00:09:43.629 --> 00:09:46.629
What food will they need and how much?

00:09:46.629 --> 00:09:50.230
When exactly will the deluge begin?

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:52.230
How long will it last?

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:56.629
Where will the ark land after the flood subsides?

00:09:56.629 --> 00:10:02.230
Nothing in the record indicates that Jehovah gave Noah all the details in advance.

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:05.730
What Noah did have was faith.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:11.830
Faith moved him to begin building his faith saved him and his family.

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:16.730
Faith in Jehovah made it happen.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:25.129
Like Noah during this time of the end, Jehovah's people have taken on challenging theocratic building projects.

00:10:25.129 --> 00:10:33.129
Certainly constructing the new world headquarters at Warwick, New York was one of these projects that required much faith.

00:10:33.129 --> 00:10:40.529
A committee of brothers was assigned to complete this vast project in less than four years to do so.

00:10:40.629 --> 00:10:45.629
They knew they had to begin by July 2013.

00:10:45.629 --> 00:10:48.629
They moved ahead in faith.

00:10:48.629 --> 00:10:57.330
Though the town had not yet approved the site permits, they began inviting workers to the site with that date in mind.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.429
Time was passing quickly.

00:10:59.429 --> 00:11:03.029
The invited volunteers were buying plane tickets.

00:11:03.029 --> 00:11:06.830
Bethel was arranging rooming and other details.

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:10.730
Yet the committee still did not have site permits.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:13.230
Would they cancel these invitations?

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:18.429
They state we spent a lot of time praying about it.

00:11:18.429 --> 00:11:27.929
We decided we needed to act in faith and we were just convinced Jehovah was going to make it happen.

00:11:27.929 --> 00:11:34.429
As the deadline approached, the brothers had done everything possible to obtain the permits.

00:11:34.429 --> 00:11:38.830
The town planning board was holding a public hearing.

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:47.830
And so the brothers' great surprise, within 15 minutes of the start of the meeting, the town board voted to approve the project.

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:51.830
These oversteers commented,

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:58.830
when the approval came through, we knew it was only by Jehovah's spirit that that happened.

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:05.029
But it was also the brothers' faith to act that made it happen.

00:12:05.029 --> 00:12:12.029
Those experiences are found in the video, World Headquarters history is being written.

00:12:12.029 --> 00:12:19.240
You can find it in the R-Activity section under the Construction Category.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:23.840
Now let's read Hebrews 11-8.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:32.539
By faith, Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place he was to receive as an inheritance.

00:12:32.539 --> 00:12:37.240
He went out, although not knowing where he was going.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:44.639
What faith it took for Abraham and his submissive wife, Sarah, to leave the prosperous city of her

00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:47.840
and go wherever Jehovah would lead them,

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:51.240
and went leaving the security of a pleasant home,

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:55.539
and moving to some strange and potentially hostile land,

00:12:55.539 --> 00:13:01.539
some 1,000 miles or 1,609 kilometers away.

00:13:01.539 --> 00:13:04.139
Do we see such faith today?

00:13:04.139 --> 00:13:05.940
Absolutely.

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:13.039
Since 2014, thousands of brothers and sisters have attended the school for Kingdom Evangelizers,

00:13:13.139 --> 00:13:18.240
agreeing to be assigned to wherever there is a need by the organization.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:22.039
Faith has made it happen.

00:13:22.039 --> 00:13:28.740
When a call goes out for skilled volunteers to help build or expand branch facilities,

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:32.940
faith moves brothers and sisters to simplify their lives

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:37.340
and to leave their comfort zone in order to assist.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:42.940
For example, in 2009, the congregations in the United States

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:49.440
were informed that an expansion project at Wal-Kill New York was being planned.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:54.639
One couple moved out of their newly built 2,200 square foot

00:13:54.639 --> 00:13:57.639
or 200 square meter dream home

00:13:57.639 --> 00:14:03.340
and into a 270 square foot or 25 square meter apartment

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:06.139
so that they could make themselves available.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.240
What happened? They explained.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.740
One month after we moved into our small apartment,

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:18.440
we received an invitation to serve as temporary volunteers at Wal-Kill.

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:22.240
It was clear to us that by simplifying our life,

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:26.340
we had given Jehovah something to bless.

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:30.340
Faith made it happen for them.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.539
So what have we learned today?

00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:38.039
Faith in Jehovah God is a powerful motivating force

00:14:38.039 --> 00:14:41.940
that impels us to act in harmony with His will.

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:44.639
Jehovah rewards such faith.

00:14:44.639 --> 00:14:49.039
Remember, the very meaning of the name of our God, Jehovah,

00:14:49.039 --> 00:14:52.240
is He causes to become.

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:56.539
Truly, He is a God who makes things happen.

00:14:56.539 --> 00:15:01.240
Brothers and sisters, let us continue to act in faith.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:04.539
Jehovah will continue to make wonderful things happen

00:15:04.539 --> 00:15:06.340
in our personal life.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:09.240
We will accomplish things we never could do

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.539
through our own personal efforts.

00:15:11.539 --> 00:15:14.639
We were able to do more in Jehovah's service.

00:15:14.639 --> 00:15:18.639
May it happen to you according to your faith.
