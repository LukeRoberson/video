00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:09.789
Inherited imperfection, we don't like it, but we all have it.

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:16.550
And since imperfection means that everyone is less than perfect, we are bound to be treated

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.469
unfairly at times, even by fellow Christians.

00:00:22.469 --> 00:00:29.829
In rare cases one might become the victim of slander or even fraud.

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:35.590
Herewith me an account about slander that occurred in the nation of Israel in the days

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.869
of King David.

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:46.509
It's about a man named Mithibasheth, who was slandered by a man named Zyba.

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:53.270
Examining the way that Mithibasheth handled this matter can be of real help to us to

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.950
so peace and to reap peace.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:05.829
Jonathan was Mithibasheth's father, and King Saul was his grandfather.

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:15.590
When Jonathan and Saul died, King David gave to Mithibasheth all the land of his grandfather.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:23.909
David assigned Zyba as a servant to take care of the land that he had given to Mithibasheth.

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:32.790
One time later a rebellion in David's household forced him to flee from Jerusalem, and Zyba went

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.590
out to meet David.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:42.230
When David asked Zyba about Mithibasheth and why he didn't come with Zyba to show his

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:51.030
support for David, Zyba slandered Mithibasheth, saying that he was seeking the kingship for

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.750
himself.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:03.510
He said to say, David believed the slander and gave Mithibasheth's land to Zyba.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:10.870
Sometime later Mithibasheth met with King David and explained why he didn't show up to

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.310
travel with him.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.949
He told David that Zyba had lied about him.

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:25.229
When hearing Mithibasheth's side of the story, David now decided that he and Zyba should

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:28.669
share the land.

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:37.030
Instead of complaining or seeking vengeance, Mithibasheth displayed the spiritual qualities

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.669
of a peacemaker, and he was willing to be wronged.

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:55.110
He said to David, as recorded at 2 Samuel, chapter 19, and verse 30, these words,

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:03.270
at this Mithibasheth said to the king, let him take it all, now that my Lord the king has

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.469
come to his house in peace.

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:15.830
Yes, Mithibasheth was more concerned about David's kingship than he was about himself.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:23.789
In the following dramatization, notice how a brother reacts to a perceived injustice,

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:35.900
and thereafter how he soes peace with his brothers.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:42.259
First time we met David, we were in chains, I'd seen a lot of things during my time as a

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:48.400
guard, but nothing like the peace that you all had.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.360
Prison chains may be strong, but we all had something much stronger.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.520
But we had to work for that peace, right Phil?

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.759
That's right.

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:12.020
There was a misunderstanding, that got blown all out of proportion, and I didn't handle it

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.379
the best.

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:20.180
The more I tried to defend myself, the worse it became.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.220
Brothers, there must be some mistake.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:33.430
This isn't true, you know me.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.470
I wasn't prepared for how far I would go.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.910
There's one more announcement.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:48.100
Because their Philip Kim is no longer serving as an elder.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:55.699
The next few months were a real struggle, but by more details came to light, I thought

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:59.019
I'd be reappointed.

00:04:59.019 --> 00:05:00.019
But I wasn't.

00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:10.139
I couldn't understand why.

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:26.699
I felt bitterness growing inside.

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:33.060
Everything became about me, how I felt, what I deserved.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:41.220
It was like a fog that stopped me from seeing what Jehovah deserved, and I really needed

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.209
his help.

00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:53.290
I found comfort and accounts of Jehovah's servants were either misunderstood or misjudged,

00:05:53.290 --> 00:06:02.430
but maintain their loyalty to him.

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:10.350
They helped me realize that it's a privilege just to be in Jehovah's organization.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:18.350
Being a peace with my brothers was more important than any appointed position.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:32.839
Without peace, I don't know how we could have managed what was to come.

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:39.240
Our threat is fat today, and I'll be your secretary, just like Barrick was the Jeremiah.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:50.689
I don't know what I'd do without you.

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:59.610
The question now for all of us is, how can we imitate the example of Muthybasheth?

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:08.129
First of all, if you are the victim of minor gossip or rude treatment by someone, why

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:13.769
not choose to let it pass and not make a big issue of it?

00:07:13.769 --> 00:07:18.769
Isn't that what first Peter 4.8 advises?

00:07:18.769 --> 00:07:28.569
First Peter 4.8 reads, above all things have intense love for one another, and then it

00:07:28.569 --> 00:07:30.970
tells us what our love can do.

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:38.209
It says, because love covers a multitude of sins.

00:07:38.209 --> 00:07:48.089
Yes, love covers sins and imperfections if we are willing to let love have its way.

00:07:48.089 --> 00:07:54.370
But what if you are the victim of a more serious injustice?

00:07:54.370 --> 00:08:00.209
For example, the brother in the video, he felt that he was a victim of injustice when he

00:08:00.209 --> 00:08:03.050
was deleted as an elder.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:10.329
He tried to clarify matters, but since he didn't get the response he was hoping for, he

00:08:10.329 --> 00:08:12.889
became very upset.

00:08:12.889 --> 00:08:21.410
He lost his peace, and he caused others to lose their peaceful relationship with him.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:28.569
To regain his peace, the brother dug into the scriptures, looking for examples he could

00:08:28.569 --> 00:08:36.169
benefit from, and he prayerfully looked to Jehovah to help him.

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:44.009
He could see the importance of self-control and being guided by God's spirit.

00:08:44.009 --> 00:08:53.049
As a result, he was able to be at peace with himself, and so peace with his brothers.

00:08:53.049 --> 00:09:00.129
Now think for a moment about the unfair decision David made when he told Mothibusheth that

00:09:00.129 --> 00:09:04.570
he and Zyba were to share the land.

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:13.850
Zyba was the cause of the problem, not Mothibusheth, however Mothibusheth displayed the qualities

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:21.769
of a spiritual man by not looking out for his own interests, by being patient and by

00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:25.210
not seeking vengeance.

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:35.090
Read with me at 2 Samuel, chapter 19, verse 25, through verse 28.

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:38.090
2 Samuel 19, 25, through 28.

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:39.889
It reads,

00:09:39.889 --> 00:09:47.289
When he came to Jerusalem, that is, Mothibusheth went to Jerusalem to meet the king.

00:09:47.289 --> 00:09:52.610
The king said to him, Why did you not go with me Mothibusheth?

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:58.370
For this he said, My Lord the king, my servant tricked me.

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:04.450
For your servant had said, Let me get my donkey saddled so that I may ride on it and go

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:06.450
with the king.

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:09.330
For your servant is crippled.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:13.009
But he slandered your servant to my Lord the king.

00:10:13.009 --> 00:10:19.690
However, my Lord the king is like an angel of the true God, so do whatever seems good

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:22.169
to you.

00:10:22.169 --> 00:10:27.570
All the household of my father could have been doomed to death by my Lord the king,

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:32.690
and yet you placed your servant among those eating at your table.

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:38.970
So what right do I have to cry out further to the king?

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:40.769
It's truly remarkable.

00:10:40.769 --> 00:10:46.690
Mothibusheth was grateful for what he had, and he was seeking nothing more.

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:51.129
He enjoyed peace of mind and heart.

00:10:51.129 --> 00:10:58.129
If a matter involving slander, or fraud arises today, a Christian may choose to follow

00:10:58.129 --> 00:11:02.610
Jesus' instructions at Matthew 18, 15 through 17.

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:09.889
However, if for some reason following that procedure does not fully resolve the matter,

00:11:09.889 --> 00:11:17.409
he or she may choose to pursue it no further, and suffer loss rather than disturb the peace

00:11:17.409 --> 00:11:20.330
of the congregation.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:28.289
We can leave any unresolved issues with Jehovah, knowing that he sees what we do and what

00:11:28.289 --> 00:11:35.690
others do, and he will carry out justice at the right time.

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:42.129
For our own benefit, we really must try to let go of resentment.

00:11:42.129 --> 00:11:46.370
When we do, we benefit ourselves.

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:52.129
When we forgive, we forgive others, Jehovah forgives us.

00:11:52.129 --> 00:11:56.889
Now that doesn't mean that we minimize or excuse the wrong conduct of fellow believers,

00:11:56.889 --> 00:11:58.690
no.

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:05.649
But it does mean that we imitate Mothibusheth by letting go of resentment and pursuing

00:12:05.649 --> 00:12:07.769
peace.

00:12:07.769 --> 00:12:14.929
We draw closer to Jehovah by following the advice at Psalm 55-22.

00:12:14.929 --> 00:12:21.929
Throw your burden on Jehovah, and he will sustain you, never will he allow the righteous

00:12:21.929 --> 00:12:24.929
one to fall.

00:12:24.929 --> 00:12:33.649
And as Romans 15-13 assures us, Jehovah will fill you with all joy and peace by your

00:12:33.649 --> 00:12:37.659
trusting in him.

00:12:37.659 --> 00:12:43.940
Brother Joel Dalinger, a helper to the service committee, will now consider the next talk

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.340
of this symposium.

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:51.539
How they sowed and reaped peace, Paul and Barnabas.
