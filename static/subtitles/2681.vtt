00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:41.420
There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:28.699
This one came to him in the night.

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:38.360
Rabbi, we know that you have come from God as a teacher.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:48.979
For no one can perform these signs that you perform unless God is with him.

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:56.650
Most truly I say to you, unless anyone is born again,

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.219
he cannot see the kingdom of God.

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:04.500
How can a man be born when he is old?

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.139
He cannot enter into the womb of his mother the second time he'd be born.

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:13.430
Kenny.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.270
Most truly I say to you,

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.909
unless anyone is born from water and spirit,

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:23.669
he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:27.669
What has been born from the flesh is flesh

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:38.060
and what has been born from the spirit is spirit.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.979
Do not be amazed because I told you you people must be born again.

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:47.819
The wind blows where it wants to and you hear the sound of it.

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.689
But you do not know where it comes from and where it is going.

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:58.620
So it is with everyone who has been born from the spirit.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:05.129
How can these things be?

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:10.610
Are you a teacher of Israel and yet do not know these things?

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.569
Most truly I say to you what we know we speak

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.839
and what we have seen we bear witness to,

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:24.019
but you do not receive the witness we give.

00:04:24.019 --> 00:04:28.540
If I have told you earthly things and you still do not believe,

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.220
how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.540
Moreover, no man has ascended into heaven

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:44.230
that the one who descended from heaven, the son of man.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.589
And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness,

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:56.230
so the son of man must be lifted up so that everyone,

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:18.209
believing in him, they have everlasting life.

00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:23.129
For God loved the world so much

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:27.509
that He gave His only begotten Son,

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:32.949
so that everyone exercising faith in Him

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:35.589
might not be destroyed,

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:40.990
but have everlasting life.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:46.629
For God did not send His Son into the world for Him to judge the world.

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:51.959
But for the world to be saved through Him

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:56.800
whoever exercises faith in Him is not to be judged

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.040
whoever does not exercise faith

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.319
has been judged already

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:08.800
because He has not exercised faith in the name

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:13.899
of the only begotten Son of God.

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:20.660
Now this is the basis for judgment

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:26.149
that the light has come into the world,

00:06:26.149 --> 00:06:31.889
but men have loved the darkness rather than the light

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:36.540
for their works were wicked,

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:41.259
for whoever practices vile things hates the light

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:44.300
and does not come to the light

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:53.199
so that His works may not be reproved

00:06:53.199 --> 00:07:04.279
but who ever does what is true comes to the light

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:08.860
so that His works may be made manifest

00:07:08.860 --> 00:08:19.610
as having been done in harmony with God.

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:22.410
After this, Jesus and His disciples

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:25.209
went into the Judean countryside

00:08:25.209 --> 00:08:31.939
and there He spent some time with them and was baptising.

00:08:31.939 --> 00:08:35.100
But John too was baptising in Inan,

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:38.009
in his Salem

00:08:38.009 --> 00:08:40.889
because there was a great quantity of water there

00:08:40.889 --> 00:08:44.450
and people kept coming and were being baptised.

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:50.700
For John had not yet been thrown into prison

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.779
now that his disciples of John had a dispute

00:08:52.779 --> 00:08:59.019
with a Jude concerning purification.

00:08:59.019 --> 00:09:03.460
Rabbi, the man who was with you across the Jordan

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.580
about whom you bore witness.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.100
See, this one is baptising

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:12.230
and all are going to him.

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:14.389
A man could not receive a single thing

00:09:15.389 --> 00:09:19.700
unless it has been given him from heaven.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.620
You yourselves bear me witness that I said

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.100
I am not the Christ.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:31.299
But I have been sent ahead of that one.

00:09:31.299 --> 00:09:36.139
Whoever has the bride is the bridegroom

00:09:36.139 --> 00:09:38.419
but the friend of the bridegroom

00:09:38.419 --> 00:09:42.649
when he stands and hears him

00:09:42.649 --> 00:09:44.970
as a great deal of joy

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:51.220
on account of the voice of the bridegroom.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:57.639
So my joy has been made complete.

00:09:57.639 --> 00:10:07.789
That one must keep on increasing

00:10:07.789 --> 00:10:20.460
but I must keep on decreasing.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.860
The one who comes from above

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:26.509
is over all others.

00:10:26.509 --> 00:10:30.019
The one who is from the earth

00:10:30.019 --> 00:10:32.419
is from the earth

00:10:32.419 --> 00:10:36.429
and speaks of things of the earth.

00:10:36.429 --> 00:10:38.429
The one who comes from heaven

00:10:38.429 --> 00:10:40.029
is over all others.

00:10:41.029 --> 00:10:45.230
He bears witness to what he has seen and heard

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:49.299
but no man accepts his witness.

00:10:49.299 --> 00:10:51.860
Whoever has accepted his witness

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.899
has put his seal to it

00:10:53.899 --> 00:11:01.659
that God is true

00:11:01.659 --> 00:11:05.419
for the one whom God sent

00:11:05.419 --> 00:11:10.179
speaks the sayings of God

00:11:10.179 --> 00:11:15.679
for he does not give the spirit sparingly.

00:11:15.679 --> 00:11:19.200
The Father loves the Son

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:26.600
and has given all things into his hand.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:30.240
The one who exercises faith in the Son

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:36.009
has everlasting life.

00:11:36.009 --> 00:11:39.370
The one who disobeys the Son will not see life

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:44.370
but the wrath of God remains upon him.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:53.149
Herod himself had sent out

00:11:53.149 --> 00:11:55.149
and arrested John

00:11:55.149 --> 00:12:10.460
behind him in prison

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:14.600
account of Herodius,

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:20.259
the wife of Philip his brother

00:12:20.259 --> 00:12:23.259
because he had married her.

00:12:23.259 --> 00:12:28.850
For John had been saying to Herod

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:30.850
it is not lawful for you

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:35.019
to have your brother's wife

00:12:35.019 --> 00:12:38.019
so Herodius was nursing a grudge against him

00:12:39.019 --> 00:12:41.019
and wanted to kill him

00:12:41.019 --> 00:12:44.269
but she could not

00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:48.269
for Herod was in fear of John

00:12:48.269 --> 00:12:54.480
knowing him to be a righteous and holy man

00:12:54.480 --> 00:13:12.799
and he was keeping him safe.

00:13:12.799 --> 00:13:14.799
After hearing him

00:13:14.799 --> 00:13:19.299
he was at a great loss as to what to do

00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:36.129
yet he continued to hear him gladly.

00:13:36.129 --> 00:13:38.129
When the Lord became aware

00:13:38.129 --> 00:13:40.129
that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making

00:13:40.129 --> 00:13:43.129
and baptizing more disciples than John

00:13:43.129 --> 00:13:46.129
although Jesus himself did no baptizing

00:13:46.129 --> 00:13:48.129
but his disciples did.

00:13:48.129 --> 00:13:50.129
He left Judea

00:13:50.129 --> 00:13:53.129
and departed again for Galilee

00:13:53.129 --> 00:13:57.129
but it was necessary for him to go through a Samaria.

00:13:57.129 --> 00:14:07.370
So he came to a city of Samaria called

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:09.370
Psycar

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:15.350
near the field that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:21.519
In fact, Jacob's well was there.

00:14:21.519 --> 00:14:26.519
Now, Jesus tired out as he was from the journey

00:14:26.519 --> 00:14:32.519
was sitting at the well.

00:14:32.519 --> 00:14:35.519
It was about the sixth hour.

00:14:35.519 --> 00:15:23.899
A woman of Samaria came to draw water.

00:15:23.899 --> 00:15:25.899
Give me a drink.

00:15:25.899 --> 00:15:28.899
For his disciples had gone off into the city to buy food.

00:15:28.899 --> 00:15:36.850
How is it that you just bite into June?

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:39.850
Ask me for a drink, even though I am a Samaritan woman.

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:43.850
For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:46.850
If you had known of the free gift of God

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:49.850
and who it is who says to you give me a drink

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:51.850
you would have asked him

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:54.850
and he would have given you living water.

00:15:54.850 --> 00:16:01.690
So you do not even have a bucket for drawing water

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:04.690
and the well is tea.

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:08.690
From what source then do you have this living water?

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:11.690
You were not greater than our father, Jacob,

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:14.690
who gave us the world and who together with his sons

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:20.269
and his cattle drank out of it, I am.

00:16:20.269 --> 00:16:24.269
Everyone drinking from this water will get thirsty again.

00:16:24.269 --> 00:16:27.269
Whoever drinks from the water that I will give him

00:16:27.269 --> 00:16:30.679
will never get thirsty at all.

00:16:30.679 --> 00:16:33.679
But the water that I will give him

00:16:33.679 --> 00:16:38.679
will become in him a spring of water

00:16:38.679 --> 00:16:41.679
bubbling up to impart everlasting life.

00:16:43.539 --> 00:16:46.539
So give me this water.

00:16:46.539 --> 00:16:48.539
So that I may neither thirst

00:16:48.539 --> 00:16:51.539
nor keep coming over to this place to draw water.

00:16:51.539 --> 00:16:58.960
Go call your husband and come to this place.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:02.850
I do not have a husband.

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:10.740
You are right in saying I do not have a husband.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:13.740
For you have had five husbands

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:18.119
and the man you now have

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:20.119
is not your husband.

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:29.029
This you have said truthfully.

00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:33.890
Sir, I see that you are a prophet.

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:44.740
Our forefathers worshipped on this mountain.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:49.049
But you people say that in Jerusalem

00:17:49.049 --> 00:17:54.769
is a place where people must worship.

00:17:54.769 --> 00:17:58.769
Believe me, woman, the hour is coming.

00:17:58.769 --> 00:18:00.769
But neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem

00:18:00.769 --> 00:18:02.769
will you worship the Father.

00:18:02.769 --> 00:18:05.769
You worship what you do not know.

00:18:05.769 --> 00:18:07.769
We worship what we know

00:18:07.769 --> 00:18:09.769
because salvation begins with the Jews.

00:18:12.269 --> 00:18:15.269
Nevertheless, the hour is coming

00:18:15.269 --> 00:18:17.269
and it is now

00:18:17.269 --> 00:18:20.269
when the true worshipers

00:18:20.269 --> 00:18:25.269
will worship the Father with spirit and truth.

00:18:25.269 --> 00:18:27.269
For indeed the Father is looking for ones

00:18:27.269 --> 00:18:29.269
like these to worship him.

00:18:29.269 --> 00:18:32.549
God is a spirit

00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:37.549
and those worshipping him must worship with spirit and truth.

00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:42.240
I know that Messiah is coming

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.240
who was called Christ.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.240
Whenever that one comes,

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:55.279
you will declare all things to us openly.

00:18:55.279 --> 00:19:07.690
I am He, the one speaking to you.

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:10.690
Just then His disciples arrived.

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:12.690
And they were surprised

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:15.690
because He was speaking with a woman.

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:18.690
Of course, no one said,

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:20.690
what are you looking for?

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:23.690
Or, why are you talking to her?

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:28.099
So the woman left her water jar

00:19:28.099 --> 00:19:30.099
and went off into the city

00:19:30.099 --> 00:19:32.099
and told the people,

00:19:32.099 --> 00:19:33.099
come and see

00:19:33.099 --> 00:19:37.099
a man who told me everything I did.

00:19:37.099 --> 00:19:40.099
Could this not perhaps be the Christ?

00:19:40.099 --> 00:19:42.099
They left the city

00:19:42.099 --> 00:19:48.940
and began coming to Him.

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:51.940
Meanwhile, the disciples were urging Him.

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:58.000
Rabbi, eat.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000
I have food to eat

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.470
that you do not know about.

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:07.170
No one brought too many things to eat, did he?

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:09.170
My food is to do the will of Him

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:11.170
who sent me

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:23.819
and to finish His work.

00:20:23.819 --> 00:20:25.819
Do you not say that there are yet four months

00:20:25.819 --> 00:20:30.160
before the harvest comes?

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.160
Look, I say to you,

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.160
lift up your eyes

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.160
and view the fields

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.160
that they are white for harvesting.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:39.160
Already, the Reaper is receiving wages

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.160
and gathering fruit

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.160
for everlasting life.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.160
So that's the soar

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.160
and the Reaper

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.160
may rejoice together.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.160
For in this respect,

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.630
the saying is true.

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:52.630
One is the soar

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:56.579
and another the Reaper.

00:20:56.579 --> 00:20:58.579
I sent you

00:20:58.579 --> 00:21:00.579
to reap what you did not labor on.

00:21:00.579 --> 00:21:03.990
Others have labored

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:06.990
and you have entered into the benefit of their labor.

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:16.859
Many of the Samaritans

00:21:16.859 --> 00:21:17.859
from that city

00:21:17.859 --> 00:21:19.859
put faith in Him

00:21:19.859 --> 00:21:20.859
because of the word of the woman

00:21:20.859 --> 00:21:22.859
who bore witness,

00:21:22.859 --> 00:21:24.859
saying,

00:21:24.859 --> 00:21:27.859
He told me all the things I did.

00:21:27.859 --> 00:21:38.059
So, when the Samaritans came to Him,

00:21:38.059 --> 00:21:41.059
they asked Him to stay with them

00:21:41.059 --> 00:21:45.920
and He stayed there two days

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:46.920
as a result,

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.920
many more believed

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:52.359
because of what He said

00:21:52.359 --> 00:21:54.359
and they said to the woman,

00:21:54.359 --> 00:21:55.359
we no longer believe

00:21:55.359 --> 00:21:57.359
just because of what you said.

00:21:57.359 --> 00:22:01.359
For we have heard for ourselves

00:22:01.359 --> 00:22:03.359
and we know that this man

00:22:03.359 --> 00:22:05.359
really is the Savior of the world.

00:22:05.359 --> 00:22:17.440
After the two days,

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.440
He left there for Galilee.

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:24.740
Jesus Himself, however,

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:26.740
bore witness

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:28.740
that a prophet has no honor

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:30.740
in his own homeland.

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:35.980
So, when He arrived in Galilee,

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.980
the Galileeans welcomed Him

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:40.980
because they had seen

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:42.980
all the things He did in Jerusalem

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:44.980
at the festival.

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:47.980
For they too had gone to the festival.

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:49.980
The appointed time

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:51.980
has been fulfilled

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:54.980
and the kingdom of God

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:56.980
has drawn near,

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:58.980
repent,

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:10.809
and have faith in the good news.

00:23:10.809 --> 00:23:14.809
Then He came again to Cana of Galilee,

00:23:14.809 --> 00:23:17.809
where He had turned the water into wine.

00:23:17.809 --> 00:23:27.549
Now, there was a royal official,

00:23:27.549 --> 00:23:30.549
whose son was sick in Capernaum.

00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:51.880
When this man heard

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:54.880
that Jesus had come out of Judea

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.880
into Galilee,

00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:12.509
He went to Him

00:24:12.509 --> 00:24:16.529
and asked Him to come down

00:24:16.529 --> 00:24:19.529
and heal His Son,

00:24:19.529 --> 00:24:22.529
but He was at the point of dying.

00:24:22.529 --> 00:24:36.019
Unless you people see signs and wonders,

00:24:36.019 --> 00:24:38.019
you'll never believe.

00:24:38.019 --> 00:24:42.019
God, come down before my young child dies.

00:24:42.019 --> 00:25:27.509
Go your way.

00:25:27.509 --> 00:25:31.950
Your son lives.

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:34.950
The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to Him,

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:36.950
and He left.

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:45.519
But while He was on His way down,

00:25:45.519 --> 00:25:48.519
His slaves met Him

00:25:48.519 --> 00:25:51.519
to say that His boy was alive.

00:25:51.519 --> 00:25:54.519
So He asked them at what hour He got better?

00:25:54.519 --> 00:25:57.519
The people left Him yesterday

00:25:57.519 --> 00:25:59.519
at the seventh hour.

00:25:59.519 --> 00:26:01.519
The father then knew

00:26:01.519 --> 00:26:03.519
that it was in the very hour

00:26:03.519 --> 00:26:05.519
that Jesus had said to Him

00:26:05.519 --> 00:26:08.519
your son lives.

00:26:08.519 --> 00:26:14.299
So He and His whole household believed

00:26:14.299 --> 00:26:17.299
that this was the second sign Jesus performed

00:26:17.299 --> 00:26:25.259
when He came from Judea into Galilee.

00:26:25.259 --> 00:26:27.259
He then went to Nazareth

00:26:27.259 --> 00:26:30.259
where He had been brought up.

00:26:30.259 --> 00:26:34.259
And according to His custom on the Sabbath day,

00:26:34.259 --> 00:26:37.259
He entered the synagogue

00:26:37.259 --> 00:26:42.660
and stood up to read.

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:45.660
So the scroll of the prophet Isaiah

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:50.819
was handed to Him,

00:26:50.819 --> 00:26:51.819
and He opened the scroll

00:26:51.819 --> 00:27:01.059
and found the place where it was written.

00:27:01.059 --> 00:27:04.059
His spirit is upon me,

00:27:04.059 --> 00:27:07.059
because He anointed me to declare good news to the poor.

00:27:07.059 --> 00:27:11.539
He sent me to proclaim liberty

00:27:11.539 --> 00:27:14.539
to the captives

00:27:14.539 --> 00:27:16.539
and a recovery of sight

00:27:16.539 --> 00:27:19.819
to the blind,

00:27:19.819 --> 00:27:22.819
to send the crushed ones away free,

00:27:22.819 --> 00:27:25.819
to preach Jehovah's acceptable year.

00:27:25.819 --> 00:27:34.930
With that, He rolled up the scroll,

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:37.930
handed it back to the attendant

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:39.930
and sat down.

00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:42.930
And the eyes of all in the synagogue

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:47.180
were intently fixed on Him.

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:51.000
Today,

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000
this scripture that you just heard,

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.779
is fulfilled.

00:27:58.779 --> 00:28:05.200
And they all began to give favorable witness about Him

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.200
and to be amazed

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:10.200
at the gracious words coming out of His mouth.

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:22.700
This is a son of Joseph.

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:23.700
Is it not?

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:41.029
No doubt you will apply this saying to me.

00:28:42.029 --> 00:28:44.029
Physician, cure yourself.

00:28:44.029 --> 00:28:46.029
Do also hear in your home territory

00:28:46.029 --> 00:28:51.269
the things we have heard were done in Copernia.

00:28:51.269 --> 00:28:52.269
Truly, I tell you that no prophet

00:28:52.269 --> 00:28:58.470
has accepted in his home territory.

00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:59.470
For instance,

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:01.470
I tell you in truth,

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:03.470
there were many widows in Israel

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:04.470
in the days of Elijah,

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:06.470
when heaven was shut up for three years

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:08.470
and six months.

00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:13.579
And a great famine came on all the land.

00:29:13.579 --> 00:29:15.579
Yet Elijah was sent to none of those women,

00:29:15.579 --> 00:29:19.930
but only to a widow in Zarifeth,

00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:21.930
the land of Sidon.

00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:29.390
Also,

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:31.390
there were many lepers in Israel

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:34.390
in the time of Elijah the prophet.

00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:36.390
Yet not one of them was cleansed.

00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:40.640
Only name in the Syrian.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:43.640
Now all those hearing these things in the synagogue

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.640
became filled with anger.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:50.890
And they rose up and rushed Him outside the city.

00:29:50.890 --> 00:30:07.319
They led Him to the brow of the mountain

00:30:07.319 --> 00:30:09.319
on which their city had been built.

00:30:09.319 --> 00:30:20.509
In order to throw Him down headlong,

00:30:20.509 --> 00:30:38.390
but He went right through their midst

00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:41.390
and continued on His way.

00:30:41.390 --> 00:31:00.130
After leaving Nazareth,

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:05.440
He came and took up residence in Copernia.

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:07.440
Beside the sea,

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:10.440
in the districts of Zebulin and Naftalai,

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:16.779
so as to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet,

00:31:16.779 --> 00:31:17.779
who said,

00:31:17.779 --> 00:31:24.319
O land of Zebulin and land of Naftalai,

00:31:24.319 --> 00:31:27.319
along the road of the sea,

00:31:27.319 --> 00:31:30.319
on the other side of the Jordan,

00:31:30.319 --> 00:31:32.319
Galilee of the nations,

00:31:32.319 --> 00:31:39.740
the people sitting in darkness,

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:47.250
saw a great light.

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:51.250
And as for those sitting in a region of Deathly Shadow,

00:31:51.250 --> 00:32:19.359
light rose on them.

00:32:19.359 --> 00:32:20.359
On one occasion,

00:32:20.359 --> 00:32:22.359
when the crowd was pressing in on Him

00:32:22.359 --> 00:32:25.359
and listening to the word of God,

00:32:25.359 --> 00:32:28.359
He was standing by the lake of Ganesirat,

00:32:28.359 --> 00:32:33.359
and He saw two boats docked at the lakeside.

00:32:33.359 --> 00:32:35.359
But the fishermen had got out of them,

00:32:35.359 --> 00:32:37.359
and were washing off their nets,

00:32:37.359 --> 00:33:02.000
and going aboard one of the boats, which were simons.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000
He asked Him to pull away a bit from land.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:27.950
Then He sat down and He began teaching the crowds from the boat.

00:33:27.950 --> 00:34:14.440
When He stopped speaking, He said to Simon,

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:17.440
Pull out to where it is deep,

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:19.440
and let down your nets for a catch.

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:29.969
Instructor, we toiled all night,

00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:41.960
and caught nothing that had to your word.

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:43.960
I will lower the nets.

00:34:43.960 --> 00:36:29.079
And they did this, they caught a great number of fish.

00:36:29.079 --> 00:36:33.519
In fact, their nets began ripping apart,

00:36:33.519 --> 00:36:43.369
so they motioned to their heart as in the other boat

00:36:43.369 --> 00:36:59.320
to come and assist them,

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:02.320
and they came and filled both boats,

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:10.630
so that bees began to sink.

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:30.590
Seeing this, Simon Peter fell down

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:33.590
at the knees of Jesus.

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:35.590
Depart from me, Lord,

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:39.940
because I am a sinful man.

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:48.400
For both He and those with Him

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.400
were overwhelmed with astonishment

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:53.400
at the catch of fish they had taken,

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:56.400
and the same was true of both James and John.

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.400
Zebedee's sons,

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.400
who were partners with Simon.

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:04.769
But Jesus said to Simon,

00:38:04.769 --> 00:38:06.769
Stop being afraid.

00:38:06.769 --> 00:38:12.139
From now on, you will be catching men alive.

00:38:12.139 --> 00:38:44.699
So they brought the boats back to land,

00:38:44.699 --> 00:38:46.699
and abandoned everything,

00:38:46.699 --> 00:38:48.699
and followed Him.

00:38:48.699 --> 00:38:50.699
Come after me,

00:38:50.699 --> 00:38:52.699
and I'll make you fishes of men.
