00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:05.299
As David Slackman visits fellow witnesses in the hospital,

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.300
notice what he considers to be the special blessings of his work.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.539
My name is David Slackman.

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:18.539
I serve as the chairman of the Hospital of the Aeson Committee in a Houston area.

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.539
And the thing I like about the Hospital of the Aeson Committee is that

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.539
I'm not there for any personal glory.

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.539
But rather I'm serving from the standpoint of helping the friends

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:34.539
I get a lot of phone calls.

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:38.539
And sometimes the phone calls may come in the middle of the night.

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:42.539
Sometimes the phone call may come during dinner time.

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:44.539
But I'm serving Jehovah.

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:46.539
I'm serving the friends.

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:48.539
I don't care when it comes.

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.539
I just want to help them.

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:53.539
So when the call comes, the emergency is there.

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.539
I have this prayerful attitude that I have Jehovah's spirit to assure them

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:00.539
that Jehovah cares for them.

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:07.540
When we're visiting with the patient, the patient is very glad to see us.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.540
And that immediately translates from their viewpoint that Jehovah is with them.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.540
When we leave the hospital and we know that the sister has been comforted by our call,

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.540
it calls to mind what the prophet said in Isaiah 40 in verse 11.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.540
It says, like a shepherd, he will care for his flock.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.540
Jehovah does care.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.540
And when we see that's what Jehovah does for the individual sheep

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.540
and I'm able to try to imitate that and also at the same time comfort the brother or sister,

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.540
that's what gives me the greatest joy.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:53.790
Brother Slackman has been serving on the hospital liaison committee for 22 years.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.790
Recall that he said his joy comes from imitating Jehovah's love for his sheep.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:05.790
You and I can feel that same joy and satisfaction anytime we help a brother or sister in need.
