00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:10.580
Now, the theme of my discussion is despite changing circumstances, always see the big picture.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.219
Perhaps you've heard the expression, he can't see the forest for the trees.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.179
This is referring to a person who is too involved in the details of a problem to see the

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:22.699
situation as a whole.

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:28.019
Now, that's a dangerous problem for anyone, but especially one of Jehovah's people, no

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.379
matter what the circumstances.

00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:33.700
We want to always see the big picture.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.859
The first sentence in today's Watchtower comments says this.

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:46.340
Philip, the evangelizer, provides a fine example of one who stayed focused on the ministry,

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.740
despite changing circumstances.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.380
And for us, just like Philip, the big picture is always Jehovah's thinking.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:02.380
See, Jehovah's view of the situation, Jehovah's thinking, Jehovah's viewpoint is so lofty,

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.380
isn't it?

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.379
So elevated.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.540
Open up to Isaiah, please, chapter 55.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.859
And notice what is said here about the altitude of Jehovah's thinking.

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:20.659
Jehovah says in verse 9, For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so my ways are

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:26.019
higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:29.700
And if you think about it, viewpoint really does make a difference, isn't it?

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.060
Makes a huge difference.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.260
For example, if you walk up to the world trade buildings on the sidewalk, look up.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.780
It's overwhelming and intimidating.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.780
On the other hand, if you fly over the world trade building in an airplane, look out the

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.780
window at it.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.379
It looks like a matchstick stuck in the ground.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.620
Well, viewpoint makes a difference.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.900
Here's another illustration.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.819
Imagine you're lost in a complex maze.

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:02.140
Now, overhead though, is a trusted friend and a helicopter.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.140
Now, that friend could easily direct you to safety, isn't not true.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.379
Well, in this illustration, our trusted friend with elevated view is, of course, Jehovah.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.379
In fact, while you're still looking at this picture, let me read to you, please,

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:21.500
Jehovah's words at Isaiah, chapter 30, verse 21, his promise.

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:28.300
He says, and your own ears will hear a word behind you saying, this is the way.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.659
Walk in it.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.699
In case you should go to the right or in case you should go to the left.

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:41.020
So if we make Jehovah's thinking or thinking, then Jehovah will safely guide us through

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.699
any situation, but now what makes it challenging to always see the big picture?

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:54.699
Well, as we touched on changing circumstances, first Corinthians 731, the scene of this world

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:59.900
is changing. Similarly, we could say the scene of our lives is constantly changing.

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:05.500
In fact, let's talk about some changing circumstances that could come our way

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:11.180
before the end of this system in which we want to always see the big picture.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.219
Now, one, a change of residence as we touched on that happened to Philip.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.780
He was forced out of the Jerusalem because of intense persecution. He ended up in Samaria,

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.419
but he saw the big picture there. He knew he didn't have to be in Jerusalem to preach.

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:31.979
He didn't have to be in Jerusalem to serve Jehovah. He could do it in Samaria.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:39.819
And he did so powerfully. Probably the most outstanding example of a change of residence is Jesus.

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:45.659
He left his heavenly abode of billions of years to live on this little tiny earth.

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:52.139
But obviously, he always saw the big picture by making Jehovah's thinking, his thinking,

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:57.340
Abraham and Sarah. Another excellent example, drastic change in residence.

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:04.620
Well, that may happen to us. We may have a change of residence either by no choice of our own

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.300
or by choice. We may choose to move and serve with the need is greater.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:16.220
We may have to move to care for family responsibility. I know of a Bethel couple at Bethel,

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:22.620
almost 25 years, they had to leave to care for a father who had dementia, but they continue

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:27.420
to see the big picture. They know that you can preach, you can go to meetings, you can

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:33.819
read God's word, you can serve Jehovah wherever you live. Now, here's another changing circumstance.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.620
You develop chronic health problems. Perhaps problems that will only be corrected by Jehovah's

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:46.699
New World. Now, in this vein, think for a moment about Jehovah. He was struck with

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:53.980
answerous boils from the crown of his head to the souls of his feet, brought to within one

00:04:53.980 --> 00:05:00.220
inch of death. He wished he was dead. And yet, he saw the big picture, didn't he?

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:06.779
I've got to keep integrity to Jehovah, no matter what. He even said at Joe 27-5,

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:14.459
until I die, I will not renounce my integrity. Now, he didn't have no idea he would be restored

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:19.579
to good health. But he knew if he kept his integrity, he would be resurrected.

00:05:19.579 --> 00:05:24.699
Jehovah would call him, and he would answer from the grave. Well, the same with us.

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:31.180
We may develop chronic health problems. We may even die before the end of the system.

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:38.939
But if we keep our integrity, such an individual will take a quick nap. And from his perspective,

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:45.100
instantaneously open his eyes in the New World, if he keeps his integrity like Joe.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.500
And if you think about this, no matter how long we have to suffer some illness,

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:56.060
it's momentary compared to the permanency of perfect health in Jehovah's New World.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:01.660
That's what 2 Corinthians 417 says. For the tribulation is momentary in light,

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:10.060
yet it works out for us a glory that is everlasting. So if we keep our eyes on a big picture,

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:16.860
maintain integrity, we can trade a moment of pain for an eternity of perfect health.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:23.579
You could say an ounce of suffering for gigatons of pleasure.

00:06:24.459 --> 00:06:28.220
Think of that. A gigaton of billion tons compared to an ounce.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:35.660
Here's another changing circumstance. We encounter perceived injustice in the congregation.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:42.939
Now, you know what we said, perceived. Because often things are not the way we see them to be.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:49.339
We can't read hearts. We don't have all the facts. Often our view is like trying to look into a large

00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:56.220
house through the front door. This cracked open one inch, very limited view we have.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.420
So seeing the big picture will recognize we don't have all the facts.

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:04.379
And seeing the big picture will recognize who do have all the facts. Jehovah,

00:07:05.019 --> 00:07:12.939
everything is naked and openly exposed to him. Jesus, revelation 21 refers to him as having

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:20.060
the seven stars the elders in his right hand. And walking about among the seven golden lamp stands.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:25.579
So Jesus, the head of the congregation, he has the facts. So once we've done what's in our Jewish

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:31.819
diction, perhaps report the matter. Seeing the big picture will leave it in the hands of those who

00:07:31.819 --> 00:07:38.379
have all the facts confident that they will take care of this matter. If it truly is an injustice,

00:07:38.379 --> 00:07:44.060
they will take care of it in their time and their way. Now, here's another changing circumstance.

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:51.100
We come face to face with some temptation. Now, in a case like this, we want to be nothing like Eve.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:58.300
She obviously didn't see the big picture, did she? If she had, she would have realized this serpent

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:05.339
has done nothing from me. Jehovah has done everything from me. In a contradictory situation,

00:08:05.339 --> 00:08:11.740
who obviously would be telling me the truth? Instead, we want to battle like Jesus. When he was

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:17.740
tempted by the devil, he saw the big picture, didn't he? The issue of universal far sovereignty.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:23.019
So if we're tempted to look at pornography, listen to apostate ideas.

00:08:23.819 --> 00:08:30.060
For it was someone who's not our mate, as just a few examples, let's pause, elevate our thinking,

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:36.379
make Jehovah's thinking, our thinking, and let's see the big picture. And the big picture is

00:08:36.379 --> 00:08:42.860
Satan is trying to get the thin edge of a wedge into our suit of armor. And anything this world

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:49.980
has to offer cannot begin to equal the value of our relationship with Jehovah, our place in his

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:56.059
new world. We'll also be able to fast forward if we see the big picture and see the horrible consequences

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:03.580
of giving in to temptation. Now, here's one more changing circumstance. We're persecuted.

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:12.139
And this can go from ridicule to threatened with being executed and or even executed.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:17.740
Think of David for just a moment. He was ridiculed. He was threatened with death by Goliath.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:24.779
But even though David saw how big he was, but David saw the big picture, didn't he? He saw

00:09:24.779 --> 00:09:31.820
how puny, how wimpy Goliath was compared to Jehovah, the Almighty. So the big picture has to

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:37.820
always include the Almighty God, Jehovah. And again, we'll be able to fast forward, see the horrible

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:44.620
consequences of compromising if we're persecuted. On the other hand, we'll see the wonderful

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:51.659
blessings. If we keep our integrity, we do not compromise. In fact, even if we're threatened with

00:09:51.659 --> 00:09:59.019
death, we're executed. If we see the big picture, we'll realize that Satan has just handed us a

00:09:59.019 --> 00:10:05.820
validated passport right into the new world. See, that is the big picture. Well, we've talked

00:10:05.899 --> 00:10:11.419
about seeing the big picture when you have a change of residence, your health deteriorates,

00:10:12.299 --> 00:10:19.820
you encounter a perceived injustice, you come face to face with temptation, you are persecuted.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:26.220
And that's just a few examples. It may not be easy to always see the big picture in challenging

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:34.299
circumstances. But the key is to make Jehovah's thinking or thinking pause, elevate our thinking,

00:10:34.299 --> 00:10:40.700
view it from Jehovah's standpoint. The result will be protection and blessings coming our way

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:50.299
and praise going Jehovah's way.
