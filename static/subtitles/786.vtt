00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.040
What type of song sticks in your head?

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.839
For some it's a happy song

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:12.960
Yet for others it's a sad song

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.399
One that expresses the emotional pain we feel

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.800
Now consider the experience of a missionary sister and

00:00:22.879 --> 00:00:27.640
She is serving faithfully in her assignment. She's doing a wonderful work

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.359
You know at the same time

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.359
She appeared happy on the outside

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:42.840
joyful but inside in her heart a sad song was playing and it kept playing and playing

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.719
reinforcing the idea as she said

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.240
And I'm a failure and

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.880
As she said it's causing me to doubt that I have Jehovah's approval

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.280
To doubt you have Jehovah's approval. That's serious. So

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.760
This is what she was going through and then she said I read one scripture

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:10.439
That completely shifted my perspective

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.480
And she shared that scripture with me and

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:22.579
Now I want to share that scripture with you and I want you to take this and put it in your pocket

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:33.620
Carry it in your pocket a good shirt pocket scripture as you now begin your post graduation journey

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:36.140
This scripture

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.579
Zephaniah chapter three. Let's open our Bibles there Zephaniah chapter three

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:53.469
Let's read verse 17 and see how this scripture helped her and how it will help you. Let's read it

00:01:54.469 --> 00:02:00.109
Jehovah God is in your midst as a mighty one. He will save

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.870
He will exalt over you with great joy

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.549
He will become silent in his love

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:11.909
He will rejoice over you with shouts of joy

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:17.870
Embedded within embedded within this one scripture is the secret

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.990
The secret to keeping your joy bright in the days of pet

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:33.590
So let's take a closer look at this text in this one verse. We're going to note three powerful ways in which Jehovah expresses his love and

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.710
His approval of you. So pay close attention

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.710
first

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.389
He says

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:46.389
Jehovah will exalt over you with great joy

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:50.349
Exalt over you with great joy exalt over what?

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.349
over your zeal

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.349
Over your unbreakable devotion

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:05.949
He celebrates your faithful record. That's Jehovah. He's celebrating what you are doing for him. He's speaking

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.830
Then the next point it says that he becomes silent in his love

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:19.669
Jehovah is at ease. He's deeply satisfied. He's pleased with your obedience. He loves it

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:29.469
Much like a parent who reflects on their child and the good things that they are doing and becomes very proud of that child

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:35.150
Just reflecting big smile comes over the parent's face. That's the way Jehovah is

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:39.150
silent in his love how beautiful

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:43.469
But Jehovah does not remain silent

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:53.669
That silence now is it's so profound the love that he has for you is so profound your obedience looks what look what happens next now

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:56.949
This is the main point of the talk

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:04.830
So which the third expression the third sentence in this verse. I want you to see it look at it again

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.710
It's the last sentence of the verse because this is the one we want to zero in on

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:18.019
So don't miss it. He will rejoice over you with shouts of joy

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:26.740
Based on the Hebrew word the phrase can be rendered he will rejoice over you with singing

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:34.899
It's the only instance that the in the scriptures where Jehovah is referred to as singing

00:04:35.899 --> 00:04:42.100
The sentence describes Jehovah as spinning around with shouts of joy

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:49.899
The powerful imagery of singing helps us understand how profound Jehovah's love is

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.860
These are your heavenly father's strong emotions toward you his thoughts toward you

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.899
They're deep they're profound. This is Jehovah's thoughts toward you

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.160
How do you listen to Jehovah's song?

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:15.480
You meditate you think you focus on what Jehovah is singing to you what Jehovah is singing so be careful

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.360
Don't dilute his approval with self-doubt

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:22.079
With insecurity

00:05:22.079 --> 00:05:28.639
What others might think of you what others might save you don't do that. That's just watering down. What Jehovah is saying

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:32.279
Block out the negative noise

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:37.259
Now I want to give you an example

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:40.060
When you followed the direction of the organization

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.540
Even when it was difficult

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.509
Did you listen to the voice inside of you?

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.750
Because you struggle to obey I'm bad. I'm struggling to obey. No, that's your voice

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.269
Or did you hear Jehovah singing at

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.709
Deuteronomy chapter 28 and verse two?

00:06:02.709 --> 00:06:05.509
All my blessings will come upon you and

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:13.189
Overtake you because you keep listening to my voice whose voice do you listen to you listen to Jehovah's

00:06:13.829 --> 00:06:17.370
When you remain loyal under trial

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:20.129
Jehovah was singing at

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:23.689
Psalm 43 because you were loyal to me

00:06:24.329 --> 00:06:27.329
Know that I will treat you in a special way

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:30.689
Did you listen to him?

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:35.930
When you shall loyalty Jehovah promises a very specific response

00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:39.209
Make the connection

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:43.209
He is so proud of your faith. When is he he bursts into song?

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.850
That's what we're describing here

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:50.290
How wonderful this relationship you have with Jehovah is

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:54.060
however

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.339
The theme of this talk is not the soloist

00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:02.290
Because Jehovah now requires you to do something

00:07:03.209 --> 00:07:05.209
wants you to do something

00:07:05.209 --> 00:07:11.250
Now let's look at verse 14 chapter three Zephaniah chapter three verse 14 now

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:14.490
What is Jehovah wanting

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:17.290
Shout joyfully

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:19.290
shout in triumph

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.290
Be joyful and rejoice with all your heart

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:27.490
Oh now Jehovah's calling on you to join in

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:32.810
Shout joyfully rejoice with all your heart. He is inviting you to sing a duet

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:36.410
Now how do you sing with Jehovah

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:42.930
By acknowledging your record of loyalty your personal record of loyalty

00:07:43.689 --> 00:07:44.889
acknowledge it

00:07:44.889 --> 00:07:51.329
Only you and Jehovah know each word of the duet each note eat in each inflection of the song

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:58.000
He wants you to sing it with him for example

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.800
When you read a second Samuel chapter 22 and verse 26

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.600
With someone loyal

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:14.720
Jehovah you will act in loyalty. That's what Jehovah says in his word with someone loyal

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.319
Who is that someone that's you?

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:25.920
Well, what does Jehovah say he will act in loyalty? He will act. He's not passive. It's a verb. It's strong

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:27.480
He will act

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:31.100
so recall

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:35.820
How he acted in loyalty with you when you were loyal under trial

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:41.179
How did you feel when he drew closer to you? He did?

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:45.940
Did you recognize it? He drew closer to you. He acted

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.500
He gave you this Holy Spirit

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.240
so that you could

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.860
Accomplish his will and overcome the temptation or trial

00:08:55.379 --> 00:09:01.340
Did you acknowledge it? He drew closer? You felt his Holy Spirit. He connected in a stronger way

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:07.620
It was tangible. It was real. It's concrete. It's not made up. That's who Jehovah is

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.830
Now remember

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:15.269
When Jehovah sees you trying to please him

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:21.830
He reacts not simply with mild satisfaction. Oh, good boy. Oh

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:29.269
Good girl try again. We're not talking about that. He reacts with rejoicing

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:33.429
Don't dismiss it as if it was of no account

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:38.389
Instead sing with Jehovah by thanking him

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:46.409
When under pressure you were able to overcome a difficult situation with Jehovah's help

00:09:47.289 --> 00:09:49.049
Don't ignore that

00:09:49.049 --> 00:09:55.049
acknowledge his hand and power in your life shout out with him by God's power. I can scale a wall

00:09:55.929 --> 00:10:00.250
Now you're you're working with Jehovah blend your voice with Jehovah's

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:08.090
And don't let your imperfect thoughts or the thoughts of others or your own deepest feelings and insecurities about yourself

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:11.529
Cause you to drown out Jehovah's voice

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:13.929
Don't do that

00:10:13.929 --> 00:10:16.570
Let Jehovah's thoughts take the lead in your song

00:10:17.529 --> 00:10:20.330
And never doubt his feelings toward you

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:25.740
See Jehovah's thoughts are so powerful

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.500
They have the power to sustain and motivate

00:10:30.779 --> 00:10:36.860
Help you not to give up on the face of personal disappointments or knowing anxiety

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:46.090
Now this is what our sister wrote in a world of expectation

00:10:47.049 --> 00:10:48.730
Disapproval and judgment

00:10:49.769 --> 00:10:53.769
Jehovah freely expresses his feelings of joy for me

00:10:54.970 --> 00:11:00.009
This scripture has transported me from the mud of trials that drag you down

00:11:00.649 --> 00:11:06.169
Into a bubble of safety security and happiness that no one could ever take away from me

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:16.519
Clearly Jehovah was singing to her and when she joined him in this duet

00:11:16.759 --> 00:11:18.759
The song lifted her up

00:11:18.759 --> 00:11:25.000
Transported her above the difficulties into a bubble of safety security and happiness

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.960
No longer was she at the breaking point

00:11:29.399 --> 00:11:31.399
No longer did she feel like a failure

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.519
She had found the secret to keeping her in a joy

00:11:37.399 --> 00:11:39.559
And what was that

00:11:39.559 --> 00:11:43.799
Focusing on the reality of Jehovah's thoughts toward her

00:11:44.679 --> 00:11:48.919
That's what we want you to do. That's why we're giving you this final piece of encouragement

00:11:53.019 --> 00:11:55.019
Now it's been said that words

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:58.220
Are a powerful drug

00:11:59.419 --> 00:12:03.500
Because they can change the way a person thinks and feels

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.299
However

00:12:06.299 --> 00:12:09.659
Music has the power to alter our emotions

00:12:11.179 --> 00:12:14.139
So when woven together a song

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:19.580
A song can become the most powerful healing agent known to man

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.820
When you join your voice with Jehovah in this duet

00:12:24.779 --> 00:12:32.379
It can transport you to a protected place the secret place of the most high and in this secret place where true joy resides

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:35.580
No one can harm you here

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:43.340
The personal sweet melody we want to encourage you keep singing keep singing the duet

00:12:45.639 --> 00:12:51.159
This is the song you want stuck in your head for the rest of your life

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.720
And do not let the noise from within or from without overwrite your song

00:12:59.399 --> 00:13:02.679
Let Jehovah's feelings for you set the tone

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:10.440
And if you struggle to overcome negative thoughts take control change the tune

00:13:11.639 --> 00:13:12.840
How

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.039
Can I change the tune by joining in the song

00:13:19.639 --> 00:13:31.080
The sovereign lord of the universe has composed for you in his word Jehovah God the sovereign lord of the universe has composed the song for you in his word

00:13:31.639 --> 00:13:36.759
How he has given you a list of scriptures that resonate in your heart

00:13:37.399 --> 00:13:43.639
That remind you of how he feels about you you have the list in fact. We'll call this your playlist

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.360
You put that playlist in your pocket

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.399
And if you do in spite of life's challenges

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:57.000
You will be able to keep your inner joy why

00:13:57.639 --> 00:14:02.600
Because all of you have learned to sing a most beautiful duet
