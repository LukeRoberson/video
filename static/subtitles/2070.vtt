00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.300
For nearly 70 years, the principal focus of Gildiard School has been to send missionaries

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.660
to foreign lands, particularly they were assigned to remote areas of the country.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:21.019
Now, since 2011, the purpose and focus of Gildiard has changed.

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:27.660
First, all those that attend Gildiard now have already been in special full-time service.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.740
Either as missionaries, traveling overseers, or maybe they've been serving at a Bethlehem.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:39.340
Second, all those that are invited to attend Gildiard have been hand-picked by their branch

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.340
committee.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.340
Then, they're invited to attend Gildiard.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.740
They're not going to be assigned to some remote area.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.179
They're going to be assigned to a densely populated area.

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:54.939
The idea is to bolster up the organization wherever they're assigned.

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:58.259
But when I got my Gildiard invitation, I was overwhelmed, really.

00:00:58.259 --> 00:01:03.820
We had never thought about it, not because we didn't appreciate the missionary service,

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.219
but just because we were sure that we were already giving our best to Jehovah.

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:13.980
I was really struggling in my mind with that idea that we are now invited to Gildiard.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.260
Jehovah is teaching us that adjusting your goals is possible with his early spirit.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.859
We thought about the example of Paul when he went to minor Asia.

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:29.260
He wanted to go to one direction, but then the Holy Spirit said, no, no, you need to

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.260
go to another direction.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.859
Isaiah was able to offer himself to do the assignment without the knowledge of what he was going

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:36.859
to do.

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:38.859
For me, it was a good example to follow.

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:43.939
I learned Jehovah to choose our assignment, helps us to discover other areas which we

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.500
can save Jehovah, maybe even do better than we ever thought we could do.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.500
Sometimes we can surprise ourselves.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.500
I just love to be surprised by Jehovah.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.500
Taste and see that Jehovah is good, but how can we do it if we don't give Jehovah opportunities

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.500
to show that for us?

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.500
So because we have, we have fears, we limit how Jehovah can use us, we do not avail ourselves

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.500
to Jehovah's blessings.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.500
So again, it's just a case of trust in that Jehovah knows the best way for you and

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.060
follow it, and then you'll never be disappointed.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:26.900
At the graduation of the 135th class of Gilead, on September 14, 2013, the chairman, Guy

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.099
Pierce of the governing body, epitomized the student's feelings.

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:38.020
Jehovah God is taking ordinary people like you and me, causing extraordinary things to

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.500
take place according to his will and direction.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.500
Drawing on the example of the first century Macedonians, Thomas Chicky of the United

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.500
States Branch Committee explained,

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:57.000
They're giving had consequences, but they calculated the consequences and gave wholeheartedly

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.500
to a grand theocratic activity.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.500
You have not shielded yourself from the consequences of giving fully.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.500
Yes, it costs sometimes, but as it works out, there's great blessings.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.500
Gilead instructors Sam Robertson and William Samuelson, along with the governing body's

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.500
Samuel Hurd, offered some parting admonition to the students.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.500
Remember, whatever good you do in the days ahead, in whatever assignment you may find yourself

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.500
in, you did not accomplish it alone.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.500
Jehovah was with you.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.500
Our problems, difficulties, will be no match for Jehovah.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.500
Now maybe Jehovah won't take away the problem, but he certainly empowers us that we can handle

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.500
that problem.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.500
Man's extremities are Jehovah's opportunities.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.500
Show respect for the dignity of others.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:03.500
You add to your dignity when you glorify your ministry, not looking for self-lorification.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.500
The students shared regularly in the ministry and the audience enjoyed reenactments

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.500
of their experiences under the guiding hand of Michael Burnett, one of their Gilead instructors.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:21.500
Four of the students expressed how their hearts have been given firmness by their Gilead training.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.500
Joshua didn't really replace Moses.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.500
Moses had his role in Jehovah's organization as did Joshua who followed, and the same is true today.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.500
Gilead school and other theocratic schools, they don't train replacements.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.500
They simply train Jehovah's people to do what's needed by his organization right now.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:46.500
The most valuable things in Jehovah's organization are the publishers, the people around us.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.500
This whole world is in the state it's in because Satan refused to be humble.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:58.500
So for me, I realized that to be useful to Jehovah and the organization, I have to be a lesser one.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.500
That brings us to the third example we want to address.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:07.500
Jackson of the governing body referenced Jesus' observation of a poor widow near the temple treasury.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:14.500
Jesus said those two coins that were placed there, that really was her whole living.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.500
It really didn't matter how the money was going to be used.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:23.500
That was her gift to Jehovah, and she was going to be blessed because she gave it.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.500
She sometimes our efforts may appear to be futile.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:35.500
Whatever we do in Jehovah's service is proof of our faithfulness and it is our gift to Jehovah.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:44.500
A combined total of 10,495 attendees saw the graduates receive their hard earned diplomas

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.500
with the words of Brother Hurd still ringing in their ears.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.500
Well, the school has ended.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:58.500
And when you and the school are gone, may the memory linger off.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:07.500
Yes, the students of Gilead school are now trained to become a strengthening aid to the branches that they're assigned to.
