00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:04.639
What is true peace?

00:00:04.639 --> 00:00:10.800
For those who live in lands where they have wars, no doubt the focus they have on true

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.480
peace is to stop fighting, to stop the conflicts, to not have any wars.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.679
And it's true that peace does include an absence of war.

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:29.320
But in many cases the efforts of mankind to try and gain peace by stopping wars is similar

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.719
to what we say is a bandaid solution.

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.039
What do we mean by that?

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:40.640
Well, a person may have a horrible sore, perhaps even cancerous.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.280
And if he just puts a bandaid over the top, maybe it hides the sore, but really doesn't

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.079
solve the problem, does it?

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:55.119
Because peace is not just an end of war.

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:56.640
You know yourself.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.560
If you were to live in a country where there isn't any war, but still you're worried

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.719
about your health, your well-being, and your safety.

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:12.040
If you feel sick and hungry, would you say that you're having a peaceful life?

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.319
Of course not.

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:21.200
According to the Bible, the word peace means far more than just an absence of war.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.239
It means good health, well-being, and safety.

00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:30.959
And from our convention, we've seen that there's a lot involved with true peace.

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:35.400
It includes having a peaceful relationship with your hover guard.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.079
It also means having a peaceful relationship with others.

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:47.840
And also, it includes the peace of heart and mind that gives us tranquility.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.439
But now in this final talk, we're going to consider a bigger issue.

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.000
And that is universal peace.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.400
Now what do we mean by universal peace?

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:09.400
What we mean by universal peace is the type of peace that is everywhere in heaven and

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.000
on earth, in all aspects of life.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.479
It's the type of peace that only the God of peace Jehovah can bring along with the

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:21.240
Prince of Peace, Jesus Christ.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:28.199
Soon, they will take dramatic steps toward the restoration of universal peace.

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:34.879
Let's take our Bibles, and if we turn together to Romans chapter 16 and verse 20,

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:41.400
we'll see what's included in this restoration of universal peace.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.840
That's Romans 16 and verse 20.

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:51.879
There we're told, for his part, the God who gives peace will crush Satan under your

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:53.800
feet shortly.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.919
May the underserved kindness of our Lord Jesus be with you.

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:07.759
Yes, the restoration of universal peace also includes the crushing of Satan the devil.

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:12.960
So in our final discussion, the final talk of this convention, we're going to

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.639
consider four basic questions.

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:22.159
The first one is, when was universal peace disturbed?

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:27.000
Secondly, who will restore universal peace?

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.840
The third question, how will it be restored?

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.919
And then finally, we're going to think about what further blessings mankind will enjoy

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:38.520
at that time.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.960
But before we go on to answer those questions, let's review together the program that we've

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:45.960
had.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:46.960
I'm sure you'll agree.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:53.840
This has been a beautiful convention, and it's encouraged us to pursue peace.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.680
But what are some of the good points that you remember from the program?

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.560
Well as we mentioned already, there are three aspects, the peace that we discuss.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.800
First of all, our peace with Jehovah God.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:14.120
The Friday program finished with the final talk, and that's where it mentions about

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.800
not being misled by imitation peace.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.680
And then Sunday, what a beautiful public discourse we had.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.680
It said that friendship with God, how possible.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.839
And then the second aspect of our peace is peace with one another.

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:39.279
The first day, remember, we had that beautiful symposium on family peace.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:43.800
What were some of the things that we need to do to have peace in our family?

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.680
Well, love and respect are important.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.600
We need to improve our communication with one another.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.959
We need to work as a team and worship together.

00:04:54.959 --> 00:05:01.920
And then Saturday, we had another interesting symposium when it said about peace records,

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.279
music and wreck peace.

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:13.279
Remember some of those inappropriate boasting, envy, dishonesty, harmful gossip, and uncontrolled

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:15.519
anger.

00:05:15.519 --> 00:05:22.399
And then the third aspect of peace deals with our personal peace, our inner calm despite

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:24.439
trials.

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:29.519
On Saturday, we had a very interesting talk that mentions the need to safeguard our bond

00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:31.519
of peace.

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:36.720
And then on Sunday, we went through another symposium where it gave examples of those

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.879
who had soared peace and then reaped peace.

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:45.720
As we look through the program, I'm sure there's so many points that you can remember

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.560
that you enjoyed.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:53.480
Of course, one of the highlights at any convention is when we have the baptism.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.279
If you were baptized at this convention, we'd like to welcome you.

00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:04.120
Yes, welcome you to the Christian Brotherhood, because we know that you're working hard

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.040
to have peace with your over God.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:14.720
But now at this point, let's watch a video that gives us some lessons with regard to

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.000
what we've saw in the various videos in this convention.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:31.199
Enjoy.

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:32.199
Would she ever?

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:33.199
No, she wouldn't ever.

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:34.199
She's mean.

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:39.209
It feels out of your control, doesn't it?

00:06:39.209 --> 00:06:47.420
Remember when we studied about the Shula, my girl, who was really in control?

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.019
She was.

00:06:49.019 --> 00:06:51.699
You have the same power.

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:56.420
If you believe that, it'll change how you handle the pressure.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.220
My peace comes from doing the right thing.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.300
I am a wall.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:07.819
You're just a coward to get trash.

00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:10.220
Think about what the jailer had done to Paul.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.220
He could have hated him for it.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.379
Yeah, he could have.

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:18.899
But I guess he saw the jailer's pain instead of just his own.

00:07:18.899 --> 00:07:20.980
Let me show you just one scripture.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:23.740
All right, one scripture.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.259
Johova has taught us to love.

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:35.660
And he's given our family peace.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:36.660
Hello, everyone.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.379
Haley from Genoa Design here.

00:07:38.379 --> 00:07:40.740
You don't think she's showing off?

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:44.379
Is this just about Haley?

00:07:44.379 --> 00:07:46.019
Can you believe how?

00:07:46.019 --> 00:07:48.579
I haven't seen you all her posts.

00:07:48.579 --> 00:07:54.699
If Celia agrees that Haley's doing something she shouldn't, you should talk to her.

00:07:54.699 --> 00:07:58.259
I've noticed you were post-lately on Quickpost.

00:07:58.259 --> 00:07:59.060
What about them?

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.300
Some people might think you're bragging.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.860
Who would think like that?

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:03.379
You.

00:08:03.379 --> 00:08:04.620
I didn't want to upset you.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.139
Jake said that I needed to fix.

00:08:06.139 --> 00:08:07.699
Set everyone.

00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:09.100
Things my posts are in a boat.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.699
It's not what I'm saying at all.

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:15.990
You are such.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:20.629
I think back to a time when you wanted forgiveness.

00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:25.509
Love is patience and kind.

00:08:25.509 --> 00:08:29.509
It's not jealous.

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:31.430
I'm sorry, Haley.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:34.830
Genuine affection fights peace-rikers.

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:42.960
And affection grows when we really know our brothers and sisters well.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:47.879
I was always impressed with how close you two were.

00:08:47.879 --> 00:08:55.110
Well, it wasn't always that way.

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.470
What started as a small disagreement exploded.

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:03.110
You, you're the problem.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:08.470
I needed a lot of help from Jova to make things right with Nick.

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:10.309
There was a misunderstanding.

00:09:10.309 --> 00:09:14.029
I'm not going to blow an all out of proportion.

00:09:14.029 --> 00:09:17.509
And I didn't handle it the best.

00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:20.909
That's when our peace was really put to the test.

00:09:20.909 --> 00:09:26.950
The body decided unanimously that he should no longer serve you push them.

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:31.990
Phil didn't know just how tense things were between Tim and I.

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:35.750
I found comfort and accounts of Jova's servants.

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:42.230
They helped me realize that being a peace with my brothers was more important than any

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:45.730
appointed position.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:47.809
It wasn't easy.

00:09:47.809 --> 00:09:49.809
But we talked it out.

00:09:49.809 --> 00:09:53.330
And we were able to make peace with Jova's help.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:10:01.100
Without peace, I don't know how we could have managed what was to come.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:06.019
At that moment, when you hear the verdict that you'll stay in prison, it's like you've

00:10:06.019 --> 00:10:09.259
been knocked unconscious.

00:10:09.259 --> 00:10:28.169
But then, the doors of the elevator opened up and in front of us, that's Jova.

00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:34.570
When you're just about to lose all your strength, Jova does that something for you.

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:41.389
The Russian brothers and sisters, I pray for them constantly because they are going

00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:51.350
through a very tough time.

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:58.950
What I've learned from all of this is peace isn't from what's outside, from what's going

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:01.750
on or what you're experiencing.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:17.179
I've learned that peace is on the inside and that comes from Jova.

00:11:17.179 --> 00:11:20.179
Priceless lessons those were.

00:11:20.179 --> 00:11:26.940
But now at this point, friends, we're going to turn our attention to that bigger issue.

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:29.580
Universal peace.

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:33.019
Remember the first question we're going to answer?

00:11:33.019 --> 00:11:38.179
When was universal peace disturbed?

00:11:38.179 --> 00:11:41.500
People mankind was created.

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:45.500
Universal peace existed for countless ages.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:50.740
It was just like a beautiful pond of water that was undisturbed.

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:53.940
No ripples, mirror-like interference.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:12:01.340
In other words, there was utmost harmony with Jova and with all the spirit creatures.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:07.379
But then it's just as if a rock was thrown into that beautiful pond.

00:12:07.379 --> 00:12:11.659
And peace started to be disturbed.

00:12:11.659 --> 00:12:13.340
When do you think that happened?

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:19.019
Well, we'll find the answer to that question by turning to the Bible and this time if we

00:12:19.019 --> 00:12:24.539
look at 1st John, chapter 3, and verse 8.

00:12:24.539 --> 00:12:28.500
That's 1st John, chapter 3, and verse 8.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:34.669
Notice the answer to the question, when did the problem start?

00:12:34.669 --> 00:12:42.870
Here we're told, the one who practices sin originates with the devil because the devil

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:46.629
has been sinning from the beginning.

00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:53.870
For this purpose, the Son of God was made manifest to break up the works of the devil.

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:59.750
So notice the answer to the question, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:04.590
or, as the footnote says, from the time that he began.

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:08.710
Does that mean right from the very time when he was created?

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:14.470
No, he wasn't, the devil then was he, he was a perfect angel.

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:20.110
So when was it that this universal peace started to be disturbed?

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:24.230
When was it that the ripples started to go through the universe?

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:31.269
Well, you might remember that it wasn't at the time that he deceived Eve.

00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:36.509
Just a little bit like the Bible says, with a woman who gives birth to a child.

00:13:36.509 --> 00:13:39.149
That's not when the child's life starts, is it?

00:13:39.149 --> 00:13:40.990
That's well before then.

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:48.429
So likewise, this disruption of the universal peace began in heaven first.

00:13:48.429 --> 00:13:54.629
At the time that the angel who became Satan started to cover the position of Jehovah,

00:13:54.629 --> 00:13:57.549
to want worship from others.

00:13:57.549 --> 00:14:03.309
And by doing this, he alienated himself from God, and no longer was he and harmony

00:14:03.309 --> 00:14:06.029
with Jehovah's will.

00:14:06.029 --> 00:14:12.470
Then that sinful attitude was manifested in the Garden of Eden.

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:18.830
That's when he took the next step and started to disturb the peace of Adam and Eve.

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:22.429
And of course, they lost their peace with God.

00:14:22.429 --> 00:14:29.110
So let's take a moment and think about what was really involved with those events there

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:31.509
in the Garden of Eden.

00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:36.509
Some very important issues were raised.

00:14:36.509 --> 00:14:40.149
Remember how Satan, first of all, spoke to Eve?

00:14:40.149 --> 00:14:43.509
He asked what seemed like a ridiculous question.

00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:49.350
Is it true that God hasn't allowed you to eat from any tree in the garden, all the trees

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:50.350
abandoned?

00:14:50.669 --> 00:14:53.549
Well, of course, that's ridiculous.

00:14:53.549 --> 00:14:55.750
But what was he doing?

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:59.789
He was calling into question Jehovah's qualities.

00:14:59.789 --> 00:15:04.549
Yes, he was inferring that Jehovah may not be so generous.

00:15:04.549 --> 00:15:09.830
Maybe he stingy, perhaps he's holding things back from Adam and Eve, that they really

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:12.269
should have.

00:15:12.269 --> 00:15:16.149
And then Satan went one step further.

00:15:16.149 --> 00:15:21.309
He said, you will not die.

00:15:21.309 --> 00:15:27.149
Really what he was saying is, Jehovah is alive.

00:15:27.149 --> 00:15:30.470
What a horrible accusation.

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:34.429
Sadly, Eve didn't defend Jehovah.

00:15:34.429 --> 00:15:39.190
We would have expected that she would have said to Satan, who are you?

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:40.509
I don't know you.

00:15:40.509 --> 00:15:42.389
Why would I believe you?

00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:51.470
I know my loving Heavenly Father Jehovah, but no, she sided with the devil.

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:53.190
So what would Jehovah do?

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:59.509
Well, think for a moment about this, what if someone accused you wrongly in front of

00:15:59.509 --> 00:16:05.750
everybody, calling you a liar, saying all sorts of bad things about you?

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:07.509
What would you do?

00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:09.629
Would you go and punch them in the face?

00:16:09.629 --> 00:16:13.190
Well, if you did, that wouldn't be the right thing to do.

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:17.710
And it certainly wouldn't answer the questions raised.

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:22.750
You see, was that person really true in what they said or not?

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:24.909
How would you probably solve this?

00:16:24.909 --> 00:16:28.710
Well, you may take the person to court.

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:33.950
And in that court case, that person could offer whatever evidence they feel they have

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:36.190
to prove that you're a liar.

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:42.830
On the other hand, you can produce witnesses to prove that really you aren't a liar,

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:44.870
but you're very truthful.

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:51.149
And then finally, there would be a decision made as to who was right and who was wrong.

00:16:51.149 --> 00:16:57.429
Well in a similar way, these issues, these questions raised in the Garden of Eden, started

00:16:57.429 --> 00:17:00.149
a symbolic court case.

00:17:00.149 --> 00:17:02.909
So how did Jehovah respond?

00:17:02.909 --> 00:17:08.430
Wisely, he allowed time to settle these issues.

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:16.950
He allowed Satan the opportunity to try and rule mankind, to do things his way.

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:23.549
At the same time mercifully, he provided the hope for the unborn children of Adam and

00:17:23.549 --> 00:17:25.269
Eve.

00:17:25.269 --> 00:17:31.990
You remember in Genesis 3 verse 15, it speaks of an offspring or a son who would come

00:17:32.069 --> 00:17:39.349
later and eventually undo the bad that Satan had done there in the beginning, and eventually

00:17:39.349 --> 00:17:43.230
free mankind from sin and death.

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:48.549
But what has Satan been doing since his opportunities be given to him?

00:17:48.549 --> 00:17:51.150
He's still craving worship from other people.

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:55.990
He wants them to bow down to him and acknowledge him as their God.

00:17:55.990 --> 00:18:02.150
He also uses lies and deceit to blind the minds of persons.

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:07.190
And he also has great anger, particularly at this time in history, where he knows his

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:08.670
end is near.

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:17.029
And so he's influencing the world to hate anyone who stands up on Jehovah's side.

00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:21.309
But now let's think about a very interesting question.

00:18:21.309 --> 00:18:28.869
Even though we're living in a world that is ruled by Satan, is it possible at all for

00:18:28.869 --> 00:18:32.309
us to have a measure of peace with God?

00:18:32.309 --> 00:18:35.789
We're experiencing so many trials and challenges.

00:18:35.789 --> 00:18:41.509
We face opposition, we have illness, economic problems, disasters.

00:18:41.509 --> 00:18:45.549
Is it possible to have some measure of peace?

00:18:45.549 --> 00:18:48.470
The answer is found again in the scriptures.

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:56.069
And this time, if you turn with me, please, to the book of 2 Corinthians chapter 1.

00:18:56.069 --> 00:19:02.589
2 Corinthians chapter 1 and verses 3 and 4.

00:19:02.589 --> 00:19:06.470
Notice this beautiful promise.

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:14.069
Praise be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of tender mercies, and

00:19:14.069 --> 00:19:21.630
the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our trials so that we may be able to

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:28.950
comfort others in any sort of trial with the comfort that we receive from God.

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:31.869
Isn't that a beautiful scripture?

00:19:31.869 --> 00:19:33.589
What does it highlight?

00:19:33.589 --> 00:19:38.269
Notice Jehovah obviously is aware of our suffering.

00:19:38.269 --> 00:19:40.589
He feels for us.

00:19:40.589 --> 00:19:46.069
He wants to help us, it mentions He's the Father of tender mercies.

00:19:46.069 --> 00:19:51.589
But at the same time, we realize that Jehovah won't step in and fix all our problems at

00:19:51.589 --> 00:19:52.589
this point.

00:19:52.589 --> 00:19:53.589
Why?

00:19:53.589 --> 00:19:59.509
Because this is the time that Satan has the opportunity to try and rule the world.

00:19:59.509 --> 00:20:04.789
And the problems of this world really come from Satan.

00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:10.230
At the same time, we wouldn't expect Jehovah to step in and start to solve the problems

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:14.029
as if He were helping Satan the devil.

00:20:14.029 --> 00:20:21.869
But there is a time when Satan will be taken away and the problems will be solved.

00:20:21.869 --> 00:20:27.230
We can think of Jehovah's position similar to that of a father whose son is running in

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:30.029
a marathon race.

00:20:30.029 --> 00:20:36.630
As he sees his son running in the race, he may see the son is starting to tire out.

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:40.829
Or perhaps he may see that others in the race are not obeying the rules.

00:20:40.829 --> 00:20:45.470
Does that mean that the father then jumps in and takes the place of his son and helps

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:47.589
him as he runs along?

00:20:47.589 --> 00:20:50.430
No, the rules don't allow it.

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:53.869
But what the father can do is continue to encourage his son.

00:20:53.869 --> 00:20:54.869
Keep on going.

00:20:54.869 --> 00:20:57.630
Yes, you can do it.

00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:01.910
So in a similar way, what did this verse tell us?

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:06.309
It said that Jehovah gives us comfort.

00:21:06.309 --> 00:21:08.150
How does he do that?

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:14.950
He gives us peace by means of his word, the Bible, by means of Holy Spirit and by the loving

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:18.430
brotherhood that we have.

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:23.230
So at this point, what we'd like to do is have a look at a video that will highlight

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:33.019
how Jehovah lovingly helps us even in times of need.

00:21:33.019 --> 00:21:41.180
We are living in critical times, hard to deal with.

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:52.019
Many people have lost all hope and servants of Jehovah are not free from trials.

00:21:52.019 --> 00:22:05.410
We may face loss of property, loss of health, loss of loved ones.

00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:18.279
We may experience deep emotional trauma or even imprisonment for our faith.

00:22:18.279 --> 00:22:26.799
Our trials are similar to those of Job, a faithful servant of Jehovah who was so saddened

00:22:26.799 --> 00:22:34.250
that he once asked, why didn't I die at birth?

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:43.950
Perhaps we've had moments like that, but why should we not lose hope?

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:49.710
Because with every trial comes Jehovah's support.

00:22:49.710 --> 00:23:43.369
Support received in many forms, material support, emotional support, and spiritual support.

00:23:43.369 --> 00:23:51.369
And while Jehovah will not remove all our trials now, we trust that with his support,

00:23:51.369 --> 00:24:00.859
we can endure them until they disappear in the real life to come.

00:24:00.859 --> 00:24:10.460
Psalm 34, 17 and 18 says, they cried out and Jehovah heard, he saves those who are crushed

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:15.720
in spirit.

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:23.160
So we can see even though our peace has been disturbed, we can enjoy peace with God.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:26.599
So let's think about our second question.

00:24:26.599 --> 00:24:31.599
Remember that question was, who will restore universal peace?

00:24:31.599 --> 00:24:38.759
But we already saw the answer when we referred to Genesis chapter 3 verse 15, the first prophecy

00:24:38.759 --> 00:24:40.240
in the Bible.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:46.079
And mentioned the promise offspring or son, and that one is Jesus Christ, the Prince of

00:24:46.079 --> 00:24:47.400
Peace.

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:53.319
He has a key role in restoring universal peace.

00:24:53.319 --> 00:25:00.079
Very soon he's going to take the decisive action to remove this whole world and then take

00:25:00.079 --> 00:25:07.000
progressive steps toward the restoration of universal peace.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.640
But why can we be so sure that Jesus will come soon?

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:18.000
It's a very simple answer, by seeing the current events that are happening in the world

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000
today.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:26.960
Yes, as we look around us, we see so many things that are happening that prove to us that

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:30.519
Jesus will soon step in to help us.

00:25:30.519 --> 00:25:32.880
Now, how can we say that?

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:38.920
Well, let's have a look together at their famous prophecy that's recorded in Matthew chapter

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.440
24.

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:46.160
Matthew chapter 24 and verse 3.

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:53.920
Remember the apostles at this particular time were asking Jesus a very important question.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:58.200
It's at the second part of verse 3.

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:05.400
It says they asked, tell us when will these things be and what will be the sign of your

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:09.799
presence and of the conclusion of the system of things.

00:26:09.799 --> 00:26:16.359
Now, you remember no doubt from your previous studies of the Bible, how Jesus then went

00:26:16.359 --> 00:26:21.640
on to list many events that would occur during the last days.

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.680
He mentioned wars.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:24.960
He mentioned earthquakes.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:29.960
He mentioned famines and all sorts of pestilences.

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:35.559
Truly, we have seen those things happen in recent times.

00:26:35.559 --> 00:26:41.259
In addition to all of that, Matthew 24 verse 14, mentioned the need to preach the good

00:26:41.259 --> 00:26:43.920
news of the kingdom.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:50.599
But there could be some who perhaps may doubt a little and say, well, there's been wars

00:26:50.599 --> 00:26:52.160
all through time.

00:26:52.559 --> 00:26:59.200
There's been earthquakes at other times, not just in the last days and for shortages.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:07.279
So why can we be so sure that this is the time when we know that Jesus will soon bring

00:27:07.279 --> 00:27:10.160
about an end to wickedness?

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:13.839
Well, let's use an illustration.

00:27:13.839 --> 00:27:16.599
Most of us are familiar with using a computer.

00:27:16.599 --> 00:27:22.119
Now, when you sit at your computer, what's the first thing that you need to do?

00:27:22.759 --> 00:27:25.319
After you've turned it on.

00:27:25.319 --> 00:27:29.240
Usually you have to type in a password, don't you?

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.799
And you have to get it right.

00:27:30.799 --> 00:27:35.319
You have to put in all those numbers and letters that are required.

00:27:35.319 --> 00:27:40.200
Otherwise, you won't be able to start working on the computer.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:47.910
Now these days, people are very concerned about having strong passwords.

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:54.309
What do you think if you had a password that had 24 different letters and numbers?

00:27:54.309 --> 00:27:56.869
That's a very strong password.

00:27:56.869 --> 00:28:02.309
And it would be very difficult for someone just randomly to try and find out what those

00:28:02.309 --> 00:28:06.470
numbers were and unlock your computer.

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:09.950
Well how does that relate to the sign that Jesus gave?

00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:17.390
And notice that, if you look back at Matthew 24 verse 3, the question was not the signs

00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:25.069
of your presence, but the sign, just like a password, one sign.

00:28:25.069 --> 00:28:34.470
But then that sign has many different features, in fact at least 24 different features.

00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:40.309
So even though there have been wars in the past, this is the time when we see all those

00:28:40.309 --> 00:28:47.069
features coming together at one time and in that way we could say it opens the fulfillment

00:28:47.069 --> 00:28:49.069
of Bible prophecy.

00:28:49.069 --> 00:28:55.150
Yes, as we look around us, as we listen to the news each day, we can see that there is

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:59.589
a definite fulfillment of what Jesus said.

00:28:59.589 --> 00:29:02.710
Truly the end is close.

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:06.589
It's just like a jigsaw puzzle to use another illustration.

00:29:06.589 --> 00:29:11.309
When you have all the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle and you start to put them all together,

00:29:11.309 --> 00:29:16.869
eventually when all the pieces are in place, the picture is clear, isn't it?

00:29:16.869 --> 00:29:23.589
And that's exactly how we should feel about the prophecy that Jesus gave.

00:29:23.589 --> 00:29:28.869
Soon, very soon, he is going to step in and take action.

00:29:28.869 --> 00:29:36.589
But of course, sometimes we may feel, yes, we've known about this for quite some time.

00:29:36.589 --> 00:29:41.549
And it means that we've had to wait a long time.

00:29:41.549 --> 00:29:47.750
But that doesn't negate the fact that the evidence of the last days is here.

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:50.670
Perhaps we could illustrate it this way.

00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:55.589
Most of us have gone to an airport to meet someone who's coming, maybe from overseas

00:29:55.589 --> 00:29:58.269
or another part of the country.

00:29:58.269 --> 00:30:04.230
Now since 9-11, it's very hard to go to an airport and actually stand on the side of

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:07.750
the runway and see the plain land.

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:09.430
Only what happens.

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:13.750
Once you get to the airport, you are allowed to go into a large room with other people

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:17.390
and all you see are monitors on the wall.

00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:20.670
Now what may the monitor say?

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:24.789
Well you see it says there, the flight has left.

00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:29.750
Then later maybe the monitor says the flight is on time.

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:33.509
Then it says the flight has landed.

00:30:33.509 --> 00:30:37.349
Then it says the flight is taxi.

00:30:37.349 --> 00:30:42.750
Then it says at the gate, well, now you say to get really excited, aren't you?

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:47.309
And yet you haven't seen the plane and you haven't seen your friend yet.

00:30:47.309 --> 00:30:53.789
But you can see from the indications of what you see on the monitor that it must be close.

00:30:53.789 --> 00:30:58.950
And then all of a sudden the doors open, people start to come out, well now you're really

00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:03.670
excited because you know, yes, you're going to meet your friend.

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:08.549
Well that is similar to how we can view the last days.

00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:13.470
There's been a lot of things happening that we don't actually see but we see the indications

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:15.430
of what's happened.

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:23.750
And we know that very soon Jesus, the angels and the 144,000 will take steps to remove

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:30.990
this whole world and then take further steps toward the restoration of peace.

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:34.630
And that a beautiful promise.

00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:42.430
So naturally that takes us to the third question, how will universal peace be restored?

00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:45.309
What will Jesus need to do?

00:31:45.309 --> 00:31:50.509
Basically, we could say there are two actions required.

00:31:50.509 --> 00:31:56.269
One is to remove Satan and the peace disturbance.

00:31:56.269 --> 00:32:04.230
And then the second action is to undo all the evil that Satan has done.

00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:07.910
You see we don't want a band-aid solution, do we?

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:13.990
Where you're just hiding something that's very serious by putting a band-aid over it.

00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:19.789
So not only does Jesus need to take away those that are disrupting the peace, but he also

00:32:19.789 --> 00:32:26.789
has to take steps to heal mankind and to heal the earth so that all the evil, the bad

00:32:26.789 --> 00:32:31.109
things that Satan has done will be overturned.

00:32:31.109 --> 00:32:34.950
So let's think about those two actions for a moment.

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:39.710
Remember the first one is to remove the peace disturbance.

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:42.990
What steps are involved with that?

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:46.789
Remember this is a progressive action.

00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:51.950
If we take our Bibles and turn to the book of Revelation, we'll see there are several

00:32:51.950 --> 00:33:00.069
things mentioned here that help us to see how progressively Jesus has and will bring about

00:33:00.069 --> 00:33:04.029
this removal of peace disturbance.

00:33:04.029 --> 00:33:11.980
If you turn with me, please, to Revelation chapter 12, let's read together verse 9.

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:12.980
Revelation 12.

00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:19.339
Now immediately, no doubt you remember the Revelation 12 is talking about the time when

00:33:19.339 --> 00:33:23.740
Jesus' government, His kingdom, was established in the heavens.

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:26.900
That was in 1914.

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:32.779
In verse 9 it mentions what happened shortly after that time.

00:33:32.779 --> 00:33:34.619
Let's read it.

00:33:34.619 --> 00:33:41.900
So down the great dragon was hurled, the original serpent, the one called devil and Satan, who

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:45.619
was misleading the entire inhabited earth.

00:33:45.619 --> 00:33:51.019
He was hurled down to the earth and His angels were hurled down with Him.

00:33:51.019 --> 00:33:55.579
Do you notice that word that came up several times?

00:33:55.579 --> 00:33:56.579
Hurled down.

00:33:56.579 --> 00:34:02.539
You see, Jesus didn't go and say to Satan, well, look, if you don't mind, we'd like

00:34:02.539 --> 00:34:05.859
you to relocate to the earth.

00:34:05.859 --> 00:34:07.460
Whenever you're ready.

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:12.420
Satan was hurled down and what confidence that gives us.

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:18.460
That means that Jesus has the power to be able to remove Satan from the heaven and gives

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:23.579
us some idea what's going to happen in the future with regard to the earth.

00:34:23.579 --> 00:34:28.539
Of course, now we're living in a time when Satan and his demons are here in the vicinity

00:34:28.539 --> 00:34:33.179
of the earth and they are causing so much trouble.

00:34:33.179 --> 00:34:39.579
So it's another step that Jesus will take in removing those who disrupt the peace.

00:34:39.579 --> 00:34:48.019
Well, let's look at another chapter in the same book, Revelation chapter 19.

00:34:48.019 --> 00:34:53.420
Revelation chapter 19, and we're going to read, starting at verse 19, right through

00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:56.059
to 21.

00:34:56.059 --> 00:35:03.420
We might mention before we start reading it that here it describes political organizations,

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:08.539
kings and those who oppose Jesus and Jehovah God.

00:35:08.539 --> 00:35:15.420
And in a symbolic way, it refers to these as beasts, as organizations that have disrupted

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:16.420
the peace.

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:19.460
Let's see what happens to them.

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:24.579
And I saw the wild beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together

00:35:24.579 --> 00:35:30.340
to wage war against the ones seated on the horse and against his army.

00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:33.860
Now that one is Jesus Christ.

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:39.699
And the wild beast was caught and along with it the false prophet that performed in front

00:35:39.699 --> 00:35:46.139
of it the signs with which he misled those who received the mark of the wild beast and

00:35:46.139 --> 00:35:48.900
those who worship its image.

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:56.539
While still alive, they both were hurled into the fiery lake that burns with sulfur.

00:35:56.539 --> 00:36:02.420
So what happens to these political organizations and opposition to Jehovah and Jesus?

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:06.380
Again, we see the word hurled down into destruction.

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:12.019
And what about the rest of mankind that opposes Jesus' rule?

00:36:12.019 --> 00:36:15.420
Well, let's look at verse 21.

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:17.019
What does it say?

00:36:17.019 --> 00:36:22.019
That the rest were killed off with the long sword that proceeded out of the mouth of the

00:36:22.019 --> 00:36:24.420
one seated on the horse.

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:27.780
And all the birds were filled with their flesh.

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:32.539
Now that's a very interesting comment, isn't it?

00:36:32.539 --> 00:36:42.300
It helps us to see here that all those who oppose Jesus will be destroyed in the Battle

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:44.460
of Armageddon.

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:49.900
So that's another step in getting ready for universal peace.

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:53.300
First of all, Satan is cast out of heaven.

00:36:53.300 --> 00:37:00.659
And then secondly, at Armageddon, all those humans who rebel against Jesus and reject his

00:37:00.659 --> 00:37:05.019
rule, they will be taken away, destroyed.

00:37:05.019 --> 00:37:06.420
But there's something else too.

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:10.019
Let's look at chapter 20 of Revelation.

00:37:10.019 --> 00:37:20.059
It says, and I saw an angel coming down out of heaven with the key of the Abyss and

00:37:20.059 --> 00:37:22.320
a great chain in his hand.

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:28.239
He seized the dragon, the original serpent, who was the devil and Satan, and bound him

00:37:28.239 --> 00:37:30.760
for 1,000 years.

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:36.440
And he noticed the word again, hurled him into the Abyss and shot it and sealed it over

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:44.320
him so that he would not mislead the nations anymore until the 1,000 years were ended.

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:49.639
After this, he must be released for a little while.

00:37:49.639 --> 00:37:53.519
What do we notice from this description?

00:37:53.519 --> 00:38:02.119
You see, gradually, in a progressive manner, Jesus will eradicate and remove those who disrupt

00:38:02.119 --> 00:38:04.480
peace.

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:10.159
So Satan and his demons cast down to the earth, at the Battle of Armageddon, those who

00:38:10.159 --> 00:38:18.280
rebel will be destroyed, and then Satan will be put in a symbolic prison in the Abyss

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:22.159
for 1,000 years, along with his demons.

00:38:22.159 --> 00:38:29.679
So that's the first action that Jesus needs to do to get rid of these troublemakers.

00:38:29.679 --> 00:38:37.039
Satan opens up the way for what the Bible refers to as the 1,000 year reign of Jesus Christ

00:38:37.039 --> 00:38:41.320
with his kingdom and co-rulers.

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:46.599
What is going to happen during that 1,000 year reign?

00:38:46.599 --> 00:38:51.639
Remember, we said it's not a bandaid type solution, isn't?

00:38:51.639 --> 00:38:57.519
He will need to help mankind and the earth to heal.

00:38:57.519 --> 00:39:03.239
Notice please how this is described for us in a scripture that we've already read.

00:39:03.239 --> 00:39:09.679
Let's turn to it again, 1 John chapter 3 and verse 8.

00:39:09.679 --> 00:39:14.960
Remember in the beginning of that verse, that's where it told us how universal peace was

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:21.480
disrupted in the beginning, at the time when that angel became the devil and started

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:28.400
sinning, but notice what it says in the second part of this verse.

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:34.760
For this purpose, the Son of God was made manifest to do what?

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:39.599
To break up or to destroy the works of the devil.

00:39:39.599 --> 00:39:43.840
Isn't that an amazing concept?

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:51.039
Jesus not only removes those who disrupt peace, but he will break up the works of the devil,

00:39:51.039 --> 00:39:56.840
the things that he's done over these thousands of years that he's been ruling this earth.

00:39:56.840 --> 00:40:05.519
That means all the evil, all the suffering, death, all of that will be taken away.

00:40:05.519 --> 00:40:08.719
Mankind will be gradually healed.

00:40:08.719 --> 00:40:14.880
Now Jesus started to break up the works of the devil when he willingly gave his life

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:16.760
as a ransom.

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:23.719
So even now we have the opportunity to gain a measure of peace with Jehovah and with others.

00:40:23.719 --> 00:40:29.519
We can ask Jehovah for forgiveness based on the ransom sacrifice.

00:40:29.519 --> 00:40:37.039
But during the thousand year reign, there will be further things that Jesus will accomplish.

00:40:37.039 --> 00:40:40.440
Notice these three aspects.

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:44.599
He will undo all harm.

00:40:44.599 --> 00:40:53.440
So that includes sickness, war, disease, famine, all these problems, all the harm will be undone.

00:40:53.440 --> 00:41:00.400
He will also undo death by resurrecting those who have died.

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:08.519
And he will also undo sin by helping mankind to grow to perfection.

00:41:08.519 --> 00:41:10.840
Isn't that a beautiful promise?

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:14.519
And doing all these works of the devil.

00:41:14.519 --> 00:41:20.920
And then by the end of the thousand years, what will we see with regard to the earth?

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:23.519
It will be a paradise.

00:41:23.519 --> 00:41:28.840
It will be exactly as Jehovah purposed it to be in the beginning.

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:37.679
Yes, Jesus by means of the kingdom will have completely broken up the works of the devil.

00:41:37.719 --> 00:41:43.039
Is that the time then when universal peace is restored?

00:41:43.039 --> 00:41:46.400
No, not quite yet.

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:49.519
Why not? Something else has to happen.

00:41:49.519 --> 00:41:53.519
And we're going to reread another scripture and that's Romans 16.

00:41:53.519 --> 00:41:56.880
Remember we refer to that in the beginning.

00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:03.039
And here we see a very interesting connection between two different things.

00:42:03.039 --> 00:42:07.239
So that's Romans 16 verse 20.

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:12.800
For his part, the God who gives peace will do what?

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:18.440
Will crush Satan under your feet shortly?

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:21.320
Do we see the connection here?

00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:28.119
Universal peace is connected with the crushing of Satan the devil.

00:42:28.119 --> 00:42:35.199
So universal peace can only be restored after Satan has been destroyed.

00:42:35.239 --> 00:42:40.000
Now, what events will occur leading up to Satan's destruction?

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:46.079
Or remember, as we read already in Revelation, Satan is going to be allowed to be released

00:42:46.079 --> 00:42:49.000
from that prison, the symbolic prison.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:55.760
And he'll have an opportunity to try to mislead people who are living on the earth at that time.

00:42:55.760 --> 00:43:00.440
Those who join Satan will be destroyed forever.

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:05.480
Then Satan will be permanently destroyed.

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:11.480
But what will happen to those perfect persons who prove faithful to Jehovah?

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:17.119
Let's see what the Bible says if we turn to the book of Romans.

00:43:17.119 --> 00:43:22.639
Romans chapter 8 and verse 21.

00:43:22.639 --> 00:43:31.230
Romans 8 verse 21, that the creation itself will also be set free from enslavement

00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:37.989
to corruption and have the glorious freedom of the children of God.

00:43:37.989 --> 00:43:40.269
What does that really mean?

00:43:40.269 --> 00:43:48.389
It means that at that point, everyone will become part of Jehovah's Universal family.

00:43:48.389 --> 00:43:54.829
All intelligent creatures in heaven and on earth will be united as one family

00:43:54.829 --> 00:43:58.949
in the pure worship of the one true God, Jehovah.

00:43:58.989 --> 00:44:02.750
What a beautiful time that will be.

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:10.630
But what further blessings are involved with this process of gradually bringing universal peace?

00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:16.670
While during the thousand year reign of Jesus, there's going to be wonderful blessings.

00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:22.550
Those who are obedient to Jehovah and Jesus will experience the things that were described

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:26.590
in the Bible book of Psalms in Psalm 72.

00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:31.670
But let's turn that together, Psalm 72.

00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:40.590
And here we see portrayed some very interesting prophetic statements about the thousand year reign.

00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:43.829
You'll notice at the beginning it says regarding Solomon.

00:44:43.829 --> 00:44:49.670
So although initially this was referring to an extent with regard to Solomon,

00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:52.989
but Jesus mentioned that he's greater than Solomon.

00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:58.389
So this has a prophetic application to the thousand year reign.

00:44:58.389 --> 00:45:01.110
Let's see what it says about peace.

00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:03.429
Starting at verse 1.

00:45:03.429 --> 00:45:05.949
We'll go through to verse 4.

00:45:05.949 --> 00:45:13.989
Oh God, give your judgments to the king and endow the son of the king with your righteousness.

00:45:13.989 --> 00:45:21.469
May he plead the cause of your people with righteousness and of your lowly ones with justice.

00:45:21.469 --> 00:45:28.230
May the mountains bring peace to the people and may the hills bring righteousness.

00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:30.949
Let him defend the lowly among the people.

00:45:30.949 --> 00:45:37.070
Let him save the sons of the poor and let him crush the defraudah.

00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:42.550
What a beautiful description of what will happen in the thousand year reign.

00:45:42.869 --> 00:45:50.110
All those who under Satan's rule will lowly, beaten up, disadvantaged,

00:45:50.110 --> 00:45:57.389
all these will experience relief because of the righteous rule of Jesus Christ.

00:45:57.389 --> 00:46:01.829
Let's go down a little further to verses 12 through 14.

00:46:01.829 --> 00:46:06.150
It tells us a little more about what Jesus will accomplish.

00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:12.590
Starting in verse 12, we're told, for he will rescue the poor who cry for help.

00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:19.829
Also the lowly one and whoever has no helper, he will have pity on the lowly and the poor

00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:23.389
and the lives of the poor he will save.

00:46:23.389 --> 00:46:31.110
From oppression and from violence, he will rescue them and notice this very interesting expression.

00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:36.030
And their blood will be precious in his eyes.

00:46:36.070 --> 00:46:37.469
What does that mean?

00:46:37.469 --> 00:46:42.630
Their blood will be precious in his eyes.

00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:47.590
In the Bible usually the word blood is associated with life, isn't it?

00:46:47.590 --> 00:46:55.070
So it's saying that each person's life will be precious to Jesus Christ.

00:46:55.070 --> 00:47:01.550
What a beautiful description of what will happen during the thousand year reign.

00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:08.750
Then if we go back a little to verse 5, we'll notice that this part of the Psalm helps

00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:12.829
us to see how widespread peace will be at that point.

00:47:12.829 --> 00:47:16.110
It uses very picturesque language.

00:47:16.110 --> 00:47:21.949
Notice in verse 5 it says, they will fear you as long as there is a sun.

00:47:21.949 --> 00:47:26.150
Well, we know the sun continues on, so they'll continue to fear him.

00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:33.150
And as long as the moon remains for generation after generation, he will be like the rain

00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:39.190
that falls on the moon grass like showers of rain that water the earth.

00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:46.750
In his days the righteous will flourish and peace will abound until the moon is no more.

00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:54.949
He will have subjects from sea to sea and from the river to the ends of the earth.

00:47:54.989 --> 00:48:02.349
Yes, what a beautiful description of the peaceful arrangements that will prevail

00:48:02.349 --> 00:48:07.789
during the thousand year reign of Jesus kingdom.

00:48:07.789 --> 00:48:12.869
But then the thousand years finishes.

00:48:12.869 --> 00:48:17.110
What can we expect when that reign ends?

00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:22.670
I'm sure you're going to enjoy our consideration of a very special part of the scriptures.

00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:24.949
1 Corinthians chapter 15.

00:48:24.949 --> 00:48:30.070
Please turn there with me and we're going to go through and look at what these verses

00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:36.590
tell us about after the end of the thousand year reign.

00:48:36.590 --> 00:48:42.190
The section of scripture we're going to consider is 1 Corinthians chapter 15

00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:46.750
verses 24 through 28.

00:48:46.789 --> 00:48:49.510
Starting in verse 24 we're told.

00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:55.789
Next, the end, when he hands over the kingdom to his God and Father,

00:48:55.789 --> 00:49:01.550
when he has brought to nothing all government and all authority and power.

00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:07.230
For he must rule as king until God has put all enemies under his feet.

00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:12.349
And the last enemy death is to be brought to nothing.

00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:16.269
For God subjected all things under his feet.

00:49:16.309 --> 00:49:20.070
But when he says that all things have been subjected,

00:49:20.070 --> 00:49:26.389
it is evident that this does not include the one who subjected all things to him.

00:49:26.389 --> 00:49:29.949
But when all things will have been subjected to him,

00:49:29.949 --> 00:49:37.309
then the Son himself will also subject himself to the one who subjected all things to him.

00:49:37.309 --> 00:49:44.250
That God may be all things to everyone.

00:49:44.250 --> 00:49:49.210
What do these verses tell us about the end of the thousand year reign?

00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:53.050
Well let's go back to verse 24.

00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:56.210
There it says, next, the end.

00:49:56.210 --> 00:50:00.289
Now this end mentioned here is not Armageddon.

00:50:00.289 --> 00:50:05.190
This is the end of the thousand year reign.

00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:11.789
At the end of the thousand year reign there are some other things too that will have finished.

00:50:11.789 --> 00:50:17.110
That means for start the end of the kingdom arrangement.

00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:22.909
There will also be an end to sin which means that mankind will no longer need the ransom

00:50:22.909 --> 00:50:25.750
or a mediator or priesthood.

00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:29.070
And then verse 26, now this is says,

00:50:29.070 --> 00:50:32.510
the last enemy death is brought to nothing.

00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:35.230
In other words, the graves will be emptied.

00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:41.070
Those who have experienced the Adamic death will have been brought back.

00:50:41.110 --> 00:50:48.750
Mankind will all attain to perfection with the end of sin, the Adamic sin.

00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:56.510
So at that point in time something very, very special happens.

00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:58.710
What is it?

00:50:58.710 --> 00:51:05.150
Well let's go back in the beginning of our discussion when we talked about the problems

00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:07.590
that occurred in the Garden of Eden.

00:51:07.590 --> 00:51:15.030
Remember Satan the devil raised some issues that resulted in a symbolic court case

00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:18.869
that involves the sanctification of Jehovah's name.

00:51:18.869 --> 00:51:25.670
Yes, Satan had claimed that Jehovah is a liar, that he doesn't rule mankind out of love,

00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:31.030
even raised a question later about who would actually serve Jehovah.

00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:36.269
So this issue has continued on, the issue of the sanctification of Jehovah's name

00:51:36.309 --> 00:51:38.030
right down through history.

00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:42.230
And over and over again, Jehovah's name has been sanctified.

00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:45.230
His reputation has been vindicated.

00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:51.510
We can see that he's a loving God, unlike Satan, such a horrible person.

00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:57.710
But Jehovah has stood out as being the loving Heavenly Father.

00:51:57.710 --> 00:52:06.230
So now at this point in time we can say the universal court case comes to a conclusion.

00:52:07.230 --> 00:52:13.750
The issue is settled, the verdict is given in what way?

00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:20.269
Well Jesus has just finished ruling mankind for a thousand years along with the 144,000.

00:52:20.269 --> 00:52:26.550
They've made the earth a paradise, mankind is now no longer sinners, they're perfect.

00:52:26.550 --> 00:52:29.230
All the problems have been healed.

00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:33.230
So at this point in time, what does Jesus do?

00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:35.429
Does he follow the example of Satan and say,

00:52:35.469 --> 00:52:40.269
well, you know, I think we did a very, very good job for this thousand years.

00:52:40.269 --> 00:52:46.309
So let's just keep everything in place and we'll keep on ruling in the kingdom.

00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:49.230
Now, we saw what he does.

00:52:49.230 --> 00:52:55.230
At that point in time, there's a marvelous answer in this court case,

00:52:55.230 --> 00:53:00.110
because Jesus hands over the kingdom back to his father.

00:53:00.110 --> 00:53:02.269
He submits to Jehovah's rule.

00:53:02.269 --> 00:53:07.550
And it's just as if Jehovah is told by his loving son, Jesus,

00:53:07.550 --> 00:53:10.989
you were right all along.

00:53:10.989 --> 00:53:16.550
This whole thing has been a terrible travesty of justice.

00:53:16.550 --> 00:53:20.789
Satan is a despicable liar and all mankind,

00:53:20.789 --> 00:53:24.789
including Jesus in the 144,000,

00:53:24.789 --> 00:53:28.190
submit themselves to Jehovah's rule.

00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:33.469
Yes, the end of the universal issue.

00:53:33.469 --> 00:53:38.190
Jehovah will then rule directly over perfect mankind.

00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:42.710
But is that the point in time when universal peace is restored?

00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:45.829
No, remember, there's some other things that need to occur.

00:53:45.829 --> 00:53:51.150
We've already mentioned that Satan will be released from his symbolic prison.

00:53:51.150 --> 00:53:54.750
He'll have an opportunity to try and mislead some.

00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:59.230
And those who side with him, Jehovah morally and ethically

00:53:59.230 --> 00:54:03.110
doesn't have to wait any longer and say, well, let's have another court case.

00:54:03.110 --> 00:54:07.789
No, they are executed immediately.

00:54:07.789 --> 00:54:10.550
But what about the rest of mankind?

00:54:10.550 --> 00:54:13.349
They become Jehovah's sons and daughters.

00:54:13.349 --> 00:54:16.829
They can talk to him directly without the need of a mediator.

00:54:16.829 --> 00:54:21.070
And their names will be written permanently in the book of life.

00:54:21.070 --> 00:54:25.510
They'll be approved to live forever in paradise.

00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:30.670
So at this point, when we're thinking about all these beautiful things that will occur,

00:54:30.670 --> 00:54:34.110
let's enjoy the final video of our convention.

00:54:34.110 --> 00:54:38.710
It highlights the blessings of the thousand year reign and beyond.

00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:43.630
And also, we're going to listen to the original song that we'll sing

00:54:43.630 --> 00:54:45.789
at the conclusion of our program.

00:54:45.789 --> 00:55:16.869
In dark stormy seas, God's people are live with our eyes of faith.

00:55:16.869 --> 00:55:26.070
We see beyond the clouds and know that the storm soon will cease.

00:55:26.070 --> 00:55:38.840
To the ends of the earth, there may peace and life be turned

00:55:38.840 --> 00:56:12.980
from the mountains and stars, all on earth and in heaven.

00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:45.280
The peace will know we've never known before by just dissimilar.

00:56:45.280 --> 00:58:26.940
Oh, he said, what a beautiful song and what beautiful images to encourage us.

00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:31.820
So brothers and sisters, we've enjoyed our convention program, haven't we?

00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:39.500
Let us be determined to keep pursuing peace, not an imitation peace, but the real peace.

00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:45.579
We can enjoy rich blessings now by having a peaceful relationship with your hover guard.

00:58:45.579 --> 00:58:49.699
Yes, trying to continue to maintain peace with one another

00:58:49.699 --> 00:58:54.539
and also attaining to this inner peace, calmness and tranquility

00:58:54.579 --> 00:58:59.260
because we have friendship with the God who gives us hope.

00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:04.619
And that hope helps us to look to the future, even though we have difficulties now,

00:59:04.619 --> 00:59:10.900
and we look forward to the time when universal peace is finally restored.

00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:18.380
But in the meantime, may the God of peace be with each one of you now and forever.
