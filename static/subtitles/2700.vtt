00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:11.650
One night the police came into our home they kicked open the doors and they broke the windows

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:25.899
They told us that they were taking the house that it was no longer hours

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:35.420
After that incident I became an angry person. I was angry and I told myself that I would do anything

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.140
to find justice and freedom

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:49.340
A partite caused divisions among people. For example, there was education meant for white people and education meant for black people

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:57.020
The education for black people was of a very low standard. When the government made a budget

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.859
most of that money was going to white people

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:08.859
Even in the classrooms the black students classrooms were overcrowded compared to the white students classrooms

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:17.019
While I was growing up I was determined to become a lawyer so that I would be able to fight a partite legally

00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:21.900
After that cruel incident and that harsh treatment

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:24.859
My view changed immediately

00:01:25.739 --> 00:01:32.780
And I wanted an immediate solution that would help us find peace, find freedom and find justice

00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:37.790
I went on to join a political organization

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.750
I agreed to cross the border where I was being trained in the military

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:53.390
The political organization made me a military commander of soldiers that were fighting for freedom

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:03.379
My responsibility as a commander was to establish cells

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.500
Where we could store our weapons for war

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.139
And to train others who came to join that organization

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:20.610
We were training them in guerrilla warfare

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:24.449
Showing them how to use guns

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.729
Or different explosives that we stored in those cells

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:37.780
I was a very cruel person who did not respect anyone who was not afraid of anything

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:41.819
I was not happy because

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.939
I expected that as one organization we would be united because we had the same purpose

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:53.439
In my experience

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.599
There was hatred

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.439
There was prejudice

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:01.229
There was quarreling

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:04.509
My wife was already one of Jehovah's Witnesses

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.030
We agreed that she should find someone who would teach me about the Bible

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:17.949
That sister came and started telling me about the good news of God's kingdom

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:27.099
But things turned sour when she said that this kingdom of God will crush all these other kingdoms

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:30.300
Including my political organization

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.219
I was furious as I was talking to her

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:42.500
But I saw that she was just smiling, not shouting, not even retaliating

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.300
I was surprised

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.300
It touched my heart

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.060
They invited me to the kingdom hall

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.659
What really got my attention is that everywhere I looked

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:59.539
Everyone in the hall was participating

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.740
Little children were raising their hands

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.979
Giving their answers freely

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.900
You could see they were well prepared and stayed on the topic

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.580
Each and every one of them found scriptures quickly

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:17.779
I was a university student

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:20.259
But I was unable to find the scriptures

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:23.620
That made me think, hey, I want to be the same as them

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.860
I noticed that the kind of education that they were receiving in Jehovah's organization

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:31.699
Was of a high standard

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.300
Compared to what we receive under Partied

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.019
Which was of a very low standard

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.899
For my experience

00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:46.060
It is clear that trusting in people is chasing the wind

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.420
But putting trust in Jehovah God brings people happiness

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:55.980
Since I was young

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.980
I just wanted to find freedom

00:04:58.459 --> 00:05:01.660
Find peace and become a happy person

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:05.819
But I could not find it until I came into the kingdom hall

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:10.220
That is where I found real freedom

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:12.379
I found real justice

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:14.779
I had real happiness

00:05:15.579 --> 00:05:17.899
And I was shown what real love is

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:22.779
My life has changed tremendously

00:05:23.579 --> 00:05:26.060
I have a close relationship with Jehovah

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:31.889
That relationship caused me to become a loving person

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:34.850
A person who is empathetic

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:38.370
Someone who strives hard to be humble

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:42.370
Someone who lives with people in peace

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:46.529
I clothe myself completely

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.009
With the new personality
