00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:06.160
After being taught by Jehovah, some of our brothers and sisters have made great sacrifices

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.720
to be able to serve him more fully.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.599
Sister Yoshi Nagata from Japan is one of them.

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:18.079
She gave up a career that many in the world spent a lifetime pursuing.

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:24.440
This is her story.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.480
I was a novelist.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.399
Young people sent me about 100 fan letters each month.

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:40.539
I became famous and felt I was contributing to society.

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:46.619
Eventually, I entered the world of TV and became an announcer.

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:50.420
I had expensive dinners and clothes.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.659
That was my life.

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:58.429
Do you think I was happy?

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:01.630
I looked so to others.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.510
But the more money and fame I gained,

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.959
the more it drove me to work.

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:15.560
New jobs, position, and material things.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.280
These were things I thought I wanted.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.400
But when I got them, what can I say?

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.219
My heart felt starved.

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:35.829
I was never happy at all.

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:40.030
A pioneer sister who was conducting the Bible study with my mom

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.430
talks to me about the words of King Solomon.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.709
Everything is futile.

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:52.469
These words touched my heart.

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:56.109
I felt this is how I feel.

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:59.790
This is the truth.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.629
Whatever I gain is futile and just makes my heart starve.

00:02:06.629 --> 00:02:11.080
I started to study the Bible.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.639
Then I suddenly got more job offers,

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:20.000
especially for advertising in moral movies

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and writing occult novels.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.460
I felt I am being used by Satan.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.539
I made up my mind.

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:34.379
I will quit my job.

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:41.460
The Bible truth I was learning satisfied my hungry heart.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:52.009
Ten months later, I was baptized.

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:55.849
Now my loving husband and I are in a congregation

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:07.379
where the need is great and enjoying pioneering.

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.500
My husband is a home tutor

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.139
and I am working part-time at a store.

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:19.379
I only have one fifth year of my former income.

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.460
There are no more fancy brand-name clothes

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.280
or expensive dinners.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.479
We are still learning how to save money

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:33.780
and make our life simple.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.979
This is really enjoyable.

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:41.219
Living a simple life, learning local dialects,

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:43.699
making new friends

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:48.620
and delivering God's word to the people.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:56.819
This is a truly satisfying life.

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.300
Do you think I look happy?

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.819
I don't just look happy.

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.020
I am happy.
