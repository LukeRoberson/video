00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:13.970
What fills you with enthusiasm?

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.969
Do you enjoy talking about tasty food

00:00:16.969 --> 00:00:18.969
or do you speak with enthusiasm

00:00:18.969 --> 00:00:22.969
about the playful antics of your little niece or nephew?

00:00:22.969 --> 00:00:26.969
Reasons for enthusiasm vary from person to person.

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:30.969
But why might a speaker who loves Jehovah

00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:33.969
and who believes what he's saying

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:36.969
lack enthusiasm when speaking?

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:40.969
It's not enough just to prepare what to say.

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:43.969
We must get our heart involved.

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.969
Think about our listeners and breathe life into our delivery.

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.969
This is important both in the congregation and in the ministry.

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.969
As you watch the following example, consider the question,

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.969
does this sister need more enthusiasm for her subject or less?

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:06.969
The coming paradise will be wonderful.

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:08.969
Notice just one of the prophecies in the Bible

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:11.969
regarding the abundant blessings God has promised.

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:15.969
It's here at Isaiah 65, 21 and 22.

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:17.969
They will build houses and live in them,

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:19.969
and they will plant vineyards and eat their fruitage.

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:21.969
They will not build for someone else to inhabit,

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:23.969
nor will they plant for others to eat.

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:26.969
So how did she do?

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:30.969
When we speak about the blessings of the new Earth under God's Kingdom,

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:34.969
we should brim with enthusiasm.

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:37.969
Enthusiasm is contagious.

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:40.969
Let's watch another example.

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:43.969
The coming paradise will be wonderful.

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:46.969
Notice just one of the prophecies in the Bible

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:50.969
regarding the abundant blessings God has promised.

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:55.969
It's here in Isaiah 65, 21 and 22.

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:58.969
They will build houses and live in them,

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:02.969
and they will plant vineyards and eat their fruitage.

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.969
They will not build for someone else to inhabit,

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:07.969
nor will they plant for others to eat.

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.969
For the days of my people will be like the days of a tree,

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:13.969
and the work of their hands,

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:18.969
my chosen ones will enjoy to the fall.

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:20.969
Well done.

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:25.969
Our sister spoke from the heart and breathed life into her material.

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:30.969
It was evident in her tone of voice and facial expression.

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:33.969
Of course, we need to be balanced.

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:38.969
We could tire our listeners if we project a high level of enthusiasm

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:41.969
throughout our presentation.

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:47.969
To illustrate this, watch this brother giving a talk at the Kingdom Hall.

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:51.969
What prophetic events can we expect in the near future?

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:55.969
First, there will be a pronouncement of peace and security.

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:59.969
Then, the great tribulation will begin when the nations turn on,

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:02.969
babble on the great, the world empire of false religion.

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:06.969
However, in harmony with the words of Matthew 24, 22,

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:10.969
the attack will be cut short on account of the chosen ones.

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:12.969
What will happen next?

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:16.969
Gog of Megag, a coalition of nations will attack God's people.

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:20.969
Also, what do you think?

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:24.969
The speaker was clearly enthusiastic,

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:29.969
a bit too enthusiastic about the devastating events to come.

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:37.969
Also, our listeners will be distracted if we use the same gesture repeatedly.

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:41.969
So we should try to make our gestures meaningful

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:46.969
and show enthusiasm primarily when teaching main points

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:50.969
and when motivating our listeners to action.

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:53.969
Let's give our brother another chance.

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:57.969
What prophetic events can we expect in the near future?

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:02.969
First, there will be a pronouncement of peace and security.

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:06.969
Then, the great tribulation will begin when the nations turn on,

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:10.969
babble on the great, the world empire of false religion.

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:15.969
However, in harmony with the words of Matthew 24, 22,

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:19.970
the attack will be cut short on account of the chosen ones.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.970
What will happen next?

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.970
Gog of Megag, a coalition of nations will attack God's people.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.970
But Jehovah will rescue his servants during Armageddon,

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.970
the war of the great day of God, the Almighty.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.970
So, what must we do now?

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:44.970
Romans 12-11 commands us to be a glow with this spirit.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.970
By putting enthusiasm into our delivery,

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.970
we'll stimulate and motivate our listeners to action.
