When World War II erupted in 1939, nearly every organized religion sent its members into the battle.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:16.280
French and American Catholics killed German and Italian Catholics.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.280
British and American Protestants killed German Protestants.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:28.910
Jehovah's Witnesses wanted to make it clear that they were no part of this controversy.

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.289
The watchtower of November 1st, 1939, reasoned,

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:44.289
how could a person who is devoted to God's kingdom favor one side or the other in a conflict between factions of the world?

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:47.289
It defined what neutrality meant.

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:53.289
We're not pacifists. Jehovah is not a pacifist. Neither is his son Jesus Christ.

00:00:53.289 --> 00:01:00.289
And when it comes to being in support of some cause, we were 100% in support of the kingdom.

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:07.290
And so we could not engage in any of the world's controversies or share in their war efforts.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:16.290
This stand would lead to their persecution by dictatorships and democracies around the world.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.290
This is something that is so fundamental to Jehovah's people.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.290
They are absolutely no part of the world.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.290
They must be strictly neutral when it comes to any conflict between the nations.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:36.290
There's no other people that are entirely neutral with regard to the world.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.290
But Jehovah's people are.
