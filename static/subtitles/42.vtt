WEBVTT

00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.620
Welcome to our program.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.620
Here's a preview of what we can look forward to.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.619
This brother began his ministry in the Congo

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:13.619
when his fellow witnesses were few in number.

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:18.620
How did Jehovah bless his hard work to preach and shepherd?

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.620
It's a joy when we come together at assembly halls

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.620
for spiritual programs.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.620
But how much work goes into caring

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.620
for these places of pure worship?

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.620
We also work to maintain peaceful relationships

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.619
with our brothers and sisters.

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:35.619
What lesson does this sister learn

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:39.619
that lets her see the beautiful qualities and others?

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:42.619
And we'll consider the privilege we have

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:44.619
to be fellow workers with God.

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:48.619
You're watching the October 2017 edition

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:50.619
of JW Broadcasting.

00:00:50.619 --> 00:01:12.790
We begin with a report from the United States branch

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.790
in Wal-Kill, New York.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.790
Any Bethel assignment is a joy

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.790
and sometimes a challenge.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.790
Proper training is therefore an important part

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.790
of every job.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.790
How does the maintenance department train hundreds

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.790
of volunteers to work efficiently and safely?

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.790
And how do the students feel

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:43.870
about the practical training they receive?

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.870
There were a few factors that created the need

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.870
at Bethel for a more structured training program.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.870
One of those factors included

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.870
the regular changeover in personnel.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.870
The brothers have to be more versatile.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.870
In their assignments, they may have to do tasks.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.870
They previously weren't trained on.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.870
Printing equipment became more technologically advanced.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.870
Our building systems became more complicated.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.870
Computer systems were now starting to be used

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.870
to control virtually everything.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.870
I feel like Bethel has definitely always been good

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.870
about training, but especially now,

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.870
I think everyone sees the need to continue investing

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.870
in the brothers and sisters

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.870
that are currently at Bethel.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.870
I don't think it's possible for someone

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.870
to know less about the trades than I did when I started.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.870
I remember my first reaction when I was invited

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.870
to help an electrical was a fear.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.870
So when I received my assignment,

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.870
I found out that it involved

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.870
running the heavy equipment.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:44.870
So I called my parents.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.870
I was really excited about it.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.870
I said, Mom and Dad, I guess what I get to do?

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.870
And Dad says, OK, son, well,

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.870
did you tell them that you don't know how to drive?

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.870
It was decided to pull a group of highly experienced,

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.870
highly skilled brothers to concentrate on developing

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.870
and teaching repeatable, consistent classes

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.870
that could bring people skill levels up to what was needed.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.870
We teach well over 100 different classes

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.870
in 12 major categories.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.870
Here at Bethel, I've probably been a part of

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.870
over 30 different classes.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.870
So it's been a variety depending on the needs

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:24.870
at the time of the assignment.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.870
I would estimate that I've taken about 15 or 20

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.870
different courses from safety and training

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.870
over the course of my 13 years in learning a trade.

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:34.870
I've become certified

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.870
and at least these seven different license requirements.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.870
We teach people technical skills,

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.870
but that's not the sole purpose of the training.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.870
If you aren't skilled in safety,

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.870
you can't be skilled in your trade and vice versa.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.870
The objective in all of our safety courses

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.870
is to get them to view safety the same way

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.870
Jehovah views it as a reflection of their spirituality.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.870
So training and safety is essential.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.870
So our goal is to take them into the classroom,

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.870
give them some time to consider the theoretical,

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.870
and then we take them out where there's a lab setup

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.870
and we have them do some tests on it.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.870
Typically they will tell us that they've been able to learn

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.870
more in a week than what they have learned

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.870
in a year of trade school.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.870
We've done over 60,000 instances of training.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.870
And so now receiving this training,

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.870
it provides an area or an aspect in which I can give my 100% to Jehovah.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.870
You see it in their eyes are just so happy that they now have

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.870
maybe a new skill or a new understanding

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.870
that they can use to benefit Jehovah.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.870
I love the fact that I came into Bethel

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.870
with virtually no experience,

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.870
and not only did I receive a trade that I could use

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.870
to carry out a work that glorifies Jehovah,

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.870
but I was trained well enough that I can share that with others

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.870
and they can be trained to.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.870
Helping someone else to go from that feeling

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.870
of not knowing anything to feeling productive

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.870
and feeling like they're contributing

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.870
is a real joy for me.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.870
And they can take what they learn wherever they go.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.870
The confidence that people leave with,

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.870
once they've received that investment,

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.870
it's confidence that they can carry out whatever assignment

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.870
Jehovah has given them,

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.870
and the confidence that Jehovah is going to train them

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.870
for whatever's being asked of them.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.870
I think if younger brothers and sisters

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.870
are trying to learn a skill so that they can come to Bethel,

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.870
that's commendable,

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.870
but more importantly is spirituality.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.870
Let Jehovah finish your training.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.870
In regard to training, we're really only getting started.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.870
The training that we are getting

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.870
in this system of things by Jehovah

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.870
and especially related to safety

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.870
is absolutely going to be vital in the New World.

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.870
I can imagine the idea of being able to use

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.870
some of the things I've learned to figure out

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.870
how we can use the natural resources

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.870
in a way without using them up.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.870
We know that we serve a God who is known

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.870
as the grand instructor.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.870
So the things that we're teaching and training right now,

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.870
it can only expand in the future.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.870
And as long as you let him train you,

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:09.620
you're going to be all right.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.620
Good training gives us confidence

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.620
to do our best for Jehovah.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.620
That's true at Bethel,

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.620
but also true in the field.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.620
Have you, though, ever felt alone in your assignment,

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.620
even if, for just a few hours in the ministry,

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.620
for the Possean Bucanga

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.620
may have felt that way early in his assignment.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.620
He was the first circuit overseer

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.620
for all of what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.620
and the Republic of Congo.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.620
He traveled great distances to visit

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.620
the few brothers throughout the territory.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.620
Listen to what encouraged him the most to keep going.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:55.540
In 1960, I was made a circuit overseer

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.540
for the whole of Congo.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:02.980
I was so happy to receive this privilege.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.980
But I was shocked and scared.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.980
The assignment was huge.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.980
Congo is a vast country.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.980
I was afraid to go to places I didn't know.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.980
I felt overwhelmed,

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.980
so I turned to Jehovah.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:25.360
Sometimes I had to go through savannas

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.360
and across the jungle.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.360
There were wild animals.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.360
One day, I climbed up a tree

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.360
to find a place to sleep.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.360
I tied myself to a branch with my bell.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.360
I was afraid I would be taken by a boa snake.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:45.959
I was afraid of getting lost in the forest.

00:07:45.959 --> 00:07:49.959
Visiting the brothers was very difficult.

00:07:49.959 --> 00:07:52.959
Sometimes the journey took many days.

00:07:52.959 --> 00:07:54.959
I remember one day,

00:07:54.959 --> 00:07:57.959
I left my house to visit the brothers to encourage them.

00:07:57.959 --> 00:08:04.189
I left at 5.30 in the morning

00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:08.189
and I arrived at 7.30 that night.

00:08:08.189 --> 00:08:11.189
I had to push my bicycle through sand

00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:14.189
for up to 13 miles or even more.

00:08:14.189 --> 00:08:17.189
Other times, we traveled by truck.

00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:19.189
That was not easy.

00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:23.189
You had to climb on top of the truck.

00:08:23.189 --> 00:08:27.189
I had to hold on tight so as not to fall.

00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:30.189
Congregations, isolated groups

00:08:30.189 --> 00:08:33.190
were far away from one another.

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:37.190
There were no phones at that time either.

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:40.190
Even though they did not know I was coming,

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:44.759
they made me feel so welcome.

00:08:44.759 --> 00:08:48.759
The brothers were really very hospitable.

00:08:48.759 --> 00:08:52.759
When I arrived, I was exhausted

00:08:52.759 --> 00:08:55.759
but so happy to see the brothers.

00:08:55.759 --> 00:09:02.029
The kids of Wala was a religion.

00:09:02.029 --> 00:09:05.029
They sent many letters to the Belgian branch

00:09:05.029 --> 00:09:08.029
to be recognized as Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:09:08.029 --> 00:09:13.539
These people used our publications

00:09:13.539 --> 00:09:16.539
and used the name Watchtower.

00:09:16.539 --> 00:09:20.539
It created a lot of confusion.

00:09:20.539 --> 00:09:23.539
To clarify the matter,

00:09:23.539 --> 00:09:26.539
the organization prepared a booklet.

00:09:26.539 --> 00:09:33.330
My mission was to check whether there were any genuine Jehovah's Witnesses

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:34.330
in Kisangani.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:43.710
We found out that these people were not Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:48.710
In all the confusion, people even tried to kill me during the trip.

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:54.179
Fortunately, I managed to escape.

00:09:54.179 --> 00:10:00.230
Since it was Jehovah who assigned me this privilege,

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:03.230
I was confident that he would always help me.

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:11.779
And today, I am very happy to have at my side my children,

00:10:11.779 --> 00:10:14.779
my grandchildren, and my great-grandchildren,

00:10:14.779 --> 00:10:17.779
all Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:10:17.779 --> 00:10:22.289
Jehovah has given me many blessings.

00:10:22.289 --> 00:10:25.289
I am truly grateful.

00:10:25.289 --> 00:10:30.289
What a joy to be used by Almighty God.

00:10:30.289 --> 00:10:34.289
Through all these years, I have never lacked anything.

00:10:34.289 --> 00:10:39.629
Jehovah has given me this strength to serve him up until now

00:10:39.629 --> 00:10:43.629
to the age of 86.

00:10:43.629 --> 00:10:47.629
In everything and for everything,

00:10:47.629 --> 00:10:51.629
my trust really is in Jehovah.

00:10:51.629 --> 00:10:55.629
There were 46 publishers in the whole of Congo.

00:10:55.629 --> 00:11:05.769
Today, I hear there are more than 223,000 Jehovah's Witnesses in the Congo.

00:11:05.769 --> 00:11:14.610
Today, when I see the increase of Jehovah's People,

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:19.559
to me, it is like a miracle.

00:11:19.559 --> 00:11:23.559
I thank Jehovah for allowing me to see the little one

00:11:23.559 --> 00:11:27.559
become a thousand here in the Congo.

00:11:27.559 --> 00:11:42.389
Brother Wakanga continues to serve as an elder at nearly 88 years old.

00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:47.389
Can you imagine yourself experiencing both the joys and difficulties he had

00:11:47.389 --> 00:11:50.389
as a circuit overseer?

00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:53.389
He courageously visited the Kitawala religious groups

00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:56.389
who claimed to serve Jehovah.

00:11:56.389 --> 00:12:01.389
Only to find some were violent and practiced immorality.

00:12:01.389 --> 00:12:04.389
But it was his reliance on Jehovah,

00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:09.389
and watching him turn the small group of brothers into more than 200,000

00:12:09.389 --> 00:12:11.389
that has kept him going.

00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:16.990
He personally experienced our theme for this program,

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:22.590
the privilege and blessing of being God's fellow worker.

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:28.590
As Jehovah's People, we enjoy many undeserved and precious privileges.

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:34.590
Among them, we bear Jehovah's name and render him sacred service.

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:40.590
As we carry out his will, he dignifies us in a very special way.

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:46.590
At 1 Corinthians 3.9, the Apostle Paul under inspiration stated

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:51.590
that we are God's fellow workers.

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:55.590
What an honor to be a fellow worker with the universal sovereign

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:58.590
our loving Heavenly Father.

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:02.590
To build appreciation for the privilege of working with Jehovah,

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:07.590
we're going to review events in the life of Jonathan, son of King Saul.

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:12.590
1 Samuel 14.45 describes Jonathan when it says,

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:16.590
for it was with God that he acted this day.

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:20.590
What was the background that led to this statement?

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:24.590
How did Jonathan act or work with Jehovah on that day?

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:29.590
What lessons can we learn from their working relationship?

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:33.590
And what blessings result from being a fellow worker with God?

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:38.899
Let us begin with some background.

00:13:38.899 --> 00:13:44.899
1 Samuel 12 and verse 20 records the encouraging words spoken

00:13:44.899 --> 00:13:48.899
by the prophet Samuel to the nation of Israel.

00:13:48.899 --> 00:13:50.899
Do not be afraid.

00:13:50.899 --> 00:13:53.899
Only do not turn away from following Jehovah

00:13:53.899 --> 00:13:56.899
and serve Jehovah with all your heart.

00:13:56.899 --> 00:13:58.899
Verse 22 adds,

00:13:58.899 --> 00:14:01.899
for the sake of his great name,

00:14:01.899 --> 00:14:04.899
Jehovah will not abandon his people.

00:14:04.899 --> 00:14:06.899
As long as they remain faithful,

00:14:06.899 --> 00:14:12.899
Jehovah would always be there to guide, protect, and rescue them.

00:14:12.899 --> 00:14:16.899
These words no doubt strengthen Jonathan to carry out Jehovah's directive

00:14:16.899 --> 00:14:21.899
to subdue the enemy nations and take possession of the Promised Land.

00:14:21.899 --> 00:14:26.179
At 1 Samuel 13,

00:14:26.179 --> 00:14:29.179
we read that Jonathan was assigned 1000 men

00:14:29.179 --> 00:14:33.179
to attack a Philistine garrison at Giba.

00:14:33.179 --> 00:14:38.179
Although poorly equipped, Jonathan and his men succeeded.

00:14:38.179 --> 00:14:42.179
This victory strengthened Jonathan's confidence in Jehovah

00:14:42.179 --> 00:14:46.179
and provides a valuable lesson for us.

00:14:46.179 --> 00:14:48.179
While we gained strength and courage

00:14:48.179 --> 00:14:51.179
from Jehovah's reassuring words in the scriptures,

00:14:51.179 --> 00:14:55.179
our confidence in Jehovah's support becomes even stronger

00:14:55.179 --> 00:14:58.179
when we successfully carry out our assignments

00:14:58.179 --> 00:15:00.179
that may seem overwhelming.

00:15:00.179 --> 00:15:04.500
The account then relates how the Philistines

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.500
were infuriated over their defeat

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.500
and mounted a massive counterattack.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.500
They sent out raiding parties

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.500
from their camp at McMash near Jerusalem.

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.500
Many as light men hid out of fear

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:21.500
and some even fled to the other side of the Jordan River.

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:27.500
In contrast, Jonathan remained courageous.

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.500
Determined to put a stop to the raids,

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.500
he confronted the Philistine outpost

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.500
at the ravine pass of McMash.

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.500
The approach was by way of a deep gorge

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.500
with nearly vertical cliffs.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.500
This would have seen next to impossible

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.500
to someone unfamiliar with the area.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.500
But Jonathan grew up in this territory

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.500
and apparently knew it well.

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:53.870
His knowledge of the surroundings

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:56.870
provides another practical lesson.

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:59.870
Whatever theocratic assignment we may be given,

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:02.870
putting forth time and effort to get to know

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:04.870
that the terrain, so to speak,

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:07.870
will contribute to our effectiveness.

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:09.870
When we show interest in our assigned work,

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:13.870
we become even more effective fellow workers of Jehovah.

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:17.149
Let's read as Jonathan prepares

00:16:17.149 --> 00:16:21.399
to take action against the Philistines.

00:16:21.399 --> 00:16:24.399
First Samuel 146 states,

00:16:24.399 --> 00:16:26.399
so Jonathan said to his armor bearer,

00:16:26.399 --> 00:16:29.399
come and let us cross over to the outpost

00:16:29.399 --> 00:16:31.399
of these uncircumcized men.

00:16:31.399 --> 00:16:34.399
Perhaps Jehovah will act in our behalf

00:16:34.399 --> 00:16:36.399
for nothing can hinder Jehovah

00:16:36.399 --> 00:16:39.399
from saving by many or by few.

00:16:39.399 --> 00:16:43.399
What contributed to his confidence in Jehovah?

00:16:43.399 --> 00:16:45.399
Recall that he put faith

00:16:45.399 --> 00:16:47.399
in Jehovah's reassuring words

00:16:47.399 --> 00:16:49.399
to the prophet Samuel.

00:16:49.399 --> 00:16:51.399
Do not be afraid.

00:16:51.399 --> 00:16:53.399
For the sake of his great name,

00:16:53.399 --> 00:16:57.399
Jehovah will not abandon his people.

00:16:57.399 --> 00:16:59.399
He experienced Jehovah's support

00:16:59.399 --> 00:17:03.399
when he struck down the Philistine garrison at Giba.

00:17:03.399 --> 00:17:07.400
Jonathan could also think back on Israel's history.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.400
He could reflect on how Gideon

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.400
and his 300 men were victorious

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:16.400
over 135,000 Midianites.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.400
He could meditate on Samson

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.400
killing 1,000 Philistines

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:24.400
with the jawbone of a donkey.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.400
Such examples would bolster his confidence

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.400
that he was working with the Almighty God, Jehovah.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:35.839
We too can meditate on fellow workers of God

00:17:35.839 --> 00:17:37.839
recorded in the scriptures,

00:17:37.839 --> 00:17:39.839
as well as published life stories

00:17:39.839 --> 00:17:42.839
of modern-day faithful servants.

00:17:42.839 --> 00:17:45.839
Such examples reinforce our faith in Jehovah

00:17:45.839 --> 00:17:50.410
as we rely on him for success.

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:52.410
Another lesson comes from the response

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:54.410
of Jonathan's armor bearer

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:57.410
at 1 Samuel 147.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:00.410
At this, his armor bearer said to him,

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:03.410
do whatever your heart impelled you to do,

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:05.410
turn wherever you wish,

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:09.410
and I will follow you wherever your heart impelled you.

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:11.410
It is unlikely that the attendant

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:15.410
would have initiated this challenging mission on his own.

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:17.410
Jonathan's confident lead

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:20.410
was a positive motivating influence on the man.

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:23.690
What happens today when elders

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:25.690
and overseers take the lead

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:29.690
and display zeal in Jehovah's work like Jonathan?

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:31.690
Others in the congregation

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:33.690
are also motivated to action

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:35.690
while they are fine example.

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:40.000
Let us now read verses 8 through 10.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Then Jonathan said,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
we will cross over to those men

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
and reveal our presence to them.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
If they say to us,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
stand still until we come to you,

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
we will stand where we are

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
and not go up to them.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
But if they say, come up against us,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
we will go up,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
because Jehovah will give them into our hand.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
This will be our sign.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Jonathan once again demonstrated

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
humble reliance on Jehovah.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Earlier in Samuel's account,

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Jonathan is described as

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
swifter than eagles and mightier than the lions.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
However, these qualities and abilities

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
did not cause him to be self-reliant

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
or overconfident.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
He sought Jehovah's direction

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.410
by means of a sign,

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:35.410
what a powerful reminder for us.

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:38.410
Regardless of any natural abilities,

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:41.410
acquired skills, or experience we may have,

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:43.410
the key to success

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:46.410
is seeking Jehovah's guidance and support.

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:48.410
We seek His direction

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:50.410
through specific prayers,

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:53.410
Bible reading, and meditation,

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:57.410
and applying direction from the faithful and discreet slave.

00:19:57.410 --> 00:20:01.410
We also consult with long-time faithful brothers and sisters

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:03.410
who can share their rich experience

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:05.410
as God's fellow workers.

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:10.849
One such example was sister Joy Oram,

00:20:10.849 --> 00:20:14.849
who served in the Britain ranch.

00:20:14.849 --> 00:20:16.849
She shared her experiences

00:20:16.849 --> 00:20:18.849
in an archived interview

00:20:18.849 --> 00:20:23.849
sometime before finishing her earthly course in 2011.

00:20:23.849 --> 00:20:25.849
Listen also to the comments

00:20:25.849 --> 00:20:27.849
of her fellow workers in Britain

00:20:27.849 --> 00:20:35.940
who benefited from their time together.

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:36.940
I had the privilege for two years

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:38.940
of sitting on the same table as sister Oram

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:40.940
for morning worship.

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:41.940
She expected nothing

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:44.940
and appreciated everything that you did for her.

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:47.940
Sister Oram was affectionately known as Joy.

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:50.940
And if you take the eith out of Joy,

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:53.940
you left with the English word Joy,

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:54.940
and that's under it.

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:57.940
My impression of Joy when I first met her

00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:59.940
was here as this frail old lady.

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:02.940
But then when you got started to speak to Joy,

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:05.940
you were tapping into a tremendous depth.

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:08.940
About the age of 20, around about that time,

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:10.940
I had the heavenly calling.

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:12.940
That was a big battle.

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:14.940
I couldn't understand why Joy Hoover

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.940
would use a person like me.

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:18.940
When I was 21,

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:21.940
I got into pioneering in 1939.

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:23.940
But the police were after me

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:25.940
because I wouldn't join the armed forces.

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:27.940
And I was tried under a new act

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:29.940
and they kept taking me to a side room

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:30.940
and saying,

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:31.940
if you will see,

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:33.940
you're not connected with Joy Hoover's witnesses.

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:35.940
Not connected with the watchtower,

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:36.940
you have a walkaway.

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:38.940
I said, I am connected with the watchtower.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:41.940
I'm proud to be connected with the watchtower.

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:42.940
They said,

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:43.940
then they are direct to you.

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:44.940
I said, no,

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.940
my stand of not doing as you wish.

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:48.940
It's my own personal stand.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:49.940
So this went on.

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:50.940
In the end,

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:52.940
they sent me to prison just for two months

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:53.940
and let me out.

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:55.940
I partnered with another sister.

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:58.940
And she and I went to Northern Ireland

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:00.940
and pioneered there for 18 months.

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:01.940
And it was in Northern Ireland.

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:03.940
We had our call to Gilead.

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:06.940
In 1948, Joy was invited to Gilead.

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:08.940
And that was the 11th class.

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:10.940
It left an impression on me,

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:12.940
which I will never, ever, ever forget.

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:15.940
You pick up that spirit of good behaviour, of love.

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:17.940
It's something that leaves its mark,

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:18.940
or it should do.

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:21.940
It has left its mark on me very, very much so.

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:22.940
One thing, rather,

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:24.940
nor impressed on us,

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:26.940
you'll be three years on your assignment

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:28.940
before you really love it.

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:29.940
And it was true,

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:31.940
because it was a hard assignment.

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:32.940
After Gilead,

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:34.940
she was assigned to be a missionary in Dublin

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:36.940
in the Irish Republic.

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:37.940
That was the time

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:40.940
when Catholic priests used to organise mobs

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:42.940
against the pioneers.

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:43.940
She was full of joy,

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:45.940
but that didn't mean to say she'd had an easy life.

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:47.940
You never went out from door to door

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.940
without being mobs and attacked

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:51.940
and beaten up and thrown around.

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:54.940
And you could only do a few houses in a road

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:56.940
and you have to get away very quickly.

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:58.940
But we made a very good name.

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:00.940
People got to know we were completely neutral.

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:03.940
They chose four of us to work the business property.

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:06.940
And I got some studies going in their offices.

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:08.940
But one place I went into,

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:10.940
I walked the length of this draper shop.

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:12.940
And I asked if I could

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:13.940
go into the manager's office.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:14.940
And as I went in,

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:16.940
I didn't say a word.

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:17.940
I didn't owe my mouth

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:18.940
and even say good morning,

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:19.940
but this man stood up

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:20.940
and he said,

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:21.940
rust the light!

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:23.940
And he took hold of me

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:24.940
by the scruff of my neck

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:25.940
and the seat of my pants

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:26.940
and he lifted me up.

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:27.940
And he carried me

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:29.940
the length of the store.

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:31.940
Well, like a silly one,

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:34.940
I should have gone heavy on him, you see.

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:35.940
But instead of that,

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:36.940
I lit my legs paddled.

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:38.940
And I was hanging on to my book bag

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:39.940
not wanting to lose it.

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:41.940
And when he got to the front door,

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:42.940
the staff,

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:44.940
their eyes were absolutely gone.

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:45.940
What's happening?

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:46.940
He opened his front door

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:47.940
and he threw me out of the tree

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:48.940
and I went,

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:49.940
zoom!

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:50.940
And just my little zoom again.

00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:52.940
And one of the brothers

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:54.940
was passing and he caught me.

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:56.940
And caught me steady.

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:57.940
So it was going on.

00:23:57.940 --> 00:23:59.940
And I couldn't stop laughing.

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:00.940
To me,

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:01.940
it was very, very funny.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.940
The rest was so crossed about it.

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:04.940
But I wasn't a store cross.

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:06.940
I thought it was quite hilarious.

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:09.940
I could see myself being carried through this shop.

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:10.940
Sky high.

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:11.940
Things like that happened.

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:14.940
These experiences did not dampen her zeal.

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:17.940
She always retained that missionary spirit.

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:19.940
I first met Joey

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:21.940
when I was commuting to Bethel in the infirmary.

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:24.940
She was sitting on that old fashioned chair

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:26.940
with this huge Bible

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:28.940
and she stayed there

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:30.940
hours reading the Bible,

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:31.940
praying to Yelva.

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:33.940
Often when you came in,

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:35.940
she'd been in the middle of Bible reading

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:36.940
and she'd be saying something like,

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:38.940
Daniel's just been thrown into the line's den.

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:40.940
Or, oh, Yelva's really angry.

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:42.940
He's thundering from the heavens.

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:43.940
And it made me think,

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:45.940
wow, she must have read the Bible so many times.

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:47.940
But every time it was as if

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:49.940
it was happening right in front of her.

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:52.940
Right up until she became incapacitated,

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:54.940
she was conducting Bible studies

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:57.940
and helping people to come to know Yelva.

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:00.940
She was looking forward to her heavenly reward.

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:02.940
And for her that was

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:05.940
the culmination of a life of joy in Yelva's service

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:07.940
and that she was just transferring

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:09.940
to her next assignment.

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:11.940
I'm very, very grateful for work.

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:13.940
In fact, often in my prayers,

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:16.940
pray to Yelva that I'll have some good work to do today.

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:26.400
I'm very grateful to have work to do.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.400
Similar to what we learned about Jonathan,

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:33.400
Sister Orham demonstrated humble reliance on Yelva.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.400
So sure was her trust in God

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:38.400
that she could face even fearful situations

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:41.400
with a sense of humor.

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:44.400
We may not be able to laugh when enduring persecution,

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:50.400
but we can imitate Joy's faith and firm resolve.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:55.000
What else can we learn from Jonathan's account?

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000
Picking up at 1 Samuel 1412,

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Jonathan and his armor bearer advanced toward the Philistines.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
From their elevated location,

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
the Philistines shout to them.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
Come up to us, and we will teach you a lesson.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
At once, Jonathan said to his armor bearer,

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.000
follow me, for Jehovah will give them into the hand of Israel.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Jonathan had requested a specific sign, and he got it.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
But it meant advancing up a steep and treacherous incline

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000
right into the enemy hands.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000
Someone lacking complete trust in Jehovah might have said,

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000
before proceeding,

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000
or perhaps we should ask for another sign,

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
but not Jonathan.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
Without hesitation, he told his attendant to follow him

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000
because Jehovah would give the enemy into their hand.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
When we received Jehovah's direction,

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000
we should, without hesitation,

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
put our hearts into the work,

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
confident of Jehovah's backing.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.380
What happened next?

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:06.380
First Samuel 14,

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:09.380
13 and 14 reports,

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:12.380
and Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet,

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:15.380
and his armor bearer was behind him.

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:18.380
And the Philistines began to fall before Jonathan,

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:22.380
and his armor bearer was putting them to death behind him.

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:26.380
In the first attack that Jonathan and his armor bearer made,

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:29.380
they struck down about 20 men.

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:32.380
Even after receiving a clear sign from Jehovah,

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:35.380
it took great effort.

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:38.380
They had to climb up on their hands and feet,

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:43.380
exerting themselves vigorously over rugged terrain.

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:45.380
The lesson?

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:47.380
Even when we received clear direction,

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:49.380
and are ready to obey,

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:53.380
carrying out our assignments will not always be easy.

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:56.380
We have to exert ourselves vigorously,

00:27:56.380 --> 00:28:01.380
being willing to work hard with all of our mind, heart, and strength.

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:07.819
How did the Philistines react to seeing Jehovah's support for his people?

00:28:07.819 --> 00:28:10.819
First Samuel 14, 15 reads,

00:28:10.819 --> 00:28:13.819
then terror spread in the field camp,

00:28:13.819 --> 00:28:16.819
and among all the people of the outpost,

00:28:16.819 --> 00:28:19.819
and even the raiding parties were terrified.

00:28:19.819 --> 00:28:21.819
The earth began quaking,

00:28:21.819 --> 00:28:24.819
and a terror from God ensued.

00:28:24.819 --> 00:28:29.819
The earthquake Jehovah caused melted the Philistines' hearts.

00:28:29.819 --> 00:28:33.819
Soon the Israelites, even those who had previously fled in fear,

00:28:33.819 --> 00:28:37.819
joined the victory battle over the Philistines.

00:28:37.819 --> 00:28:41.819
Likewise, when we put our hearts into theocratic assignments,

00:28:41.819 --> 00:28:45.819
Jehovah, our best fellow worker,

00:28:45.819 --> 00:28:51.819
will always come through with whatever we need to accomplish his will.

00:28:51.819 --> 00:28:56.819
But there's another lesson to be learned from this exciting Bible account.

00:28:56.819 --> 00:28:58.819
During the height of the battle,

00:28:58.819 --> 00:29:02.819
King Saul gave an unwise order, saying,

00:29:02.819 --> 00:29:06.819
cursed is the man who eats any food before the evening,

00:29:06.819 --> 00:29:10.819
and until I have taken vengeance on my enemies.

00:29:10.819 --> 00:29:14.819
Jonathan, however, was not aware of his father's order,

00:29:14.819 --> 00:29:17.819
and ate some wild honey that he had found.

00:29:17.819 --> 00:29:25.099
How did Saul react when he discovered that his own son had disobeyed him?

00:29:26.099 --> 00:29:31.099
First Samuel 14, 43, and 44, tells us,

00:29:31.099 --> 00:29:33.099
then Saul said to Jonathan,

00:29:33.099 --> 00:29:35.099
tell me,

00:29:35.099 --> 00:29:37.099
what have you done?

00:29:37.099 --> 00:29:39.099
So Jonathan told him,

00:29:39.099 --> 00:29:44.099
I merely tasted a little honey on the tip of the staff in my hand.

00:29:44.099 --> 00:29:46.099
Here I am.

00:29:46.099 --> 00:29:48.099
I am ready to die.

00:29:48.099 --> 00:29:50.099
At this Saul said,

00:29:50.099 --> 00:29:53.099
thus may God do and may he add to it

00:29:53.099 --> 00:29:56.099
if you do not die, Jonathan.

00:29:56.099 --> 00:30:02.099
Imagine, after all that Jonathan had done in risking his life and behalf of his people,

00:30:02.099 --> 00:30:06.099
and seeing Jehovah grant so much success,

00:30:06.099 --> 00:30:11.099
he is now being condemned to death by his own father.

00:30:11.099 --> 00:30:19.099
How his heart must have sank in disbelief, disappointment, and sadness.

00:30:19.099 --> 00:30:23.099
Would Jehovah now abandon his loyal fellow worker?

00:30:23.099 --> 00:30:27.099
First Samuel 14, 45 reads,

00:30:27.099 --> 00:30:30.099
but the people said to Saul,

00:30:30.099 --> 00:30:32.099
should Jonathan die?

00:30:32.099 --> 00:30:35.099
The one who brought this great victory to Israel?

00:30:35.099 --> 00:30:37.099
It is unthinkable,

00:30:37.099 --> 00:30:39.099
as surely as Jehovah is alive,

00:30:39.099 --> 00:30:42.099
not even a single hair of his head should fall to the ground,

00:30:42.099 --> 00:30:47.099
for it was with God that he acted this day.

00:30:47.099 --> 00:30:50.099
With that the people rescued Jonathan,

00:30:50.099 --> 00:30:53.099
and he did not die.

00:30:53.099 --> 00:31:00.099
Jonathan's success provided undeniable evidence that he was truly Jehovah's fellow worker.

00:31:00.099 --> 00:31:04.099
Jehovah, who had been at Jonathan's side the whole time,

00:31:04.099 --> 00:31:07.099
saw everything that had happened

00:31:07.099 --> 00:31:11.099
and would not allow his loyal worker to die at Saul's hands.

00:31:11.099 --> 00:31:16.339
How comforting to know that when we faithfully carry out our assignments,

00:31:16.339 --> 00:31:20.339
he will never forget our zealous efforts.

00:31:20.339 --> 00:31:26.339
If someone as close as a father fails to see and appreciate the work we do in Jehovah's service,

00:31:26.339 --> 00:31:29.339
or even turns against us,

00:31:29.339 --> 00:31:32.339
Jehovah will never forget our work.

00:31:32.339 --> 00:31:38.339
He will always be there to guide, support, protect, and bless us.

00:31:38.339 --> 00:31:45.779
What a faith-building account we've considered in 1 Samuel 13 and 14.

00:31:45.779 --> 00:31:49.779
Why not take the time to read these chapters for yourself?

00:31:49.779 --> 00:31:57.779
You'll be moved to imitate Jonathan's excellent example of loyalty, courage, and obedience.

00:31:57.779 --> 00:32:02.779
We want to be described just as Jonathan was at 1 Samuel 14.45,

00:32:02.779 --> 00:32:07.779
for it was with God that he acted this day.

00:32:07.779 --> 00:32:11.779
By continuing as industrious fellow workers with Jehovah,

00:32:11.779 --> 00:32:20.250
we are assured that through faith and patience, we will inherit the promise reward.

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:25.250
Let's look at another example of modern-day fellow workers with God.

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:31.250
Assembly hall servants care for the cleaning and maintenance of these places of worship,

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:34.250
but they don't do this work alone.

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:37.250
In this report from the United States,

00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:40.250
we'll see how the work is organized,

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:45.250
and we'll hear how our brothers and sisters feel about being able to help with the work.

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:50.650
The Assembly hall is an educational center.

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:57.410
This is a center of pure worship for all the congregations that come.

00:32:57.410 --> 00:33:01.410
Taking care of Jehovah's house as part of sacred service,

00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:04.410
even going back to the temple,

00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:08.410
everyone had an assignment, they had someone to open the doors.

00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:13.410
So, of course, they had somebody also maintaining things.

00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:19.410
As of December 2016, there's 773 Assembly halls worldwide.

00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:22.410
There's so many details on Assembly Hall.

00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:26.410
You can't do it all yourself to be overseer of Assembly Hall.

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:31.410
We're excited to do it, but it seemed real heavy at the time.

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:39.309
It does take, in our particular case, a couple of hundreds.

00:33:39.309 --> 00:33:44.309
There's about 200 or so volunteers each and every week

00:33:44.309 --> 00:33:48.309
that really are necessary to care for the Assembly Hall.

00:33:48.309 --> 00:33:52.309
The grounds, the counting, the purchasing,

00:33:52.309 --> 00:33:55.309
the maintenance and the cleaning.

00:33:55.309 --> 00:33:59.309
Each and every one of these chairs, the seating,

00:33:59.309 --> 00:34:02.309
all has moving parts, has to be maintained.

00:34:02.309 --> 00:34:05.309
And with 4,050 seats in here,

00:34:05.309 --> 00:34:10.309
we can say that every single one of them has been maintained.

00:34:10.309 --> 00:34:15.940
Well, John, 217 says, the zeal for your house will consume me.

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:19.940
And I think we have an opportunity to show Jehovah that,

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:23.940
that we have zeal, we have an eagerness, a fire for his house,

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:25.940
and caring for it.

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:29.940
So, we appreciate all those that want to work at the Assembly Hall.

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:33.940
So many of the dear friends, after they've just been in a whole day,

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:37.940
doing some terribly dirty job, they thank you for the privilege.

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:40.940
Well, that zeal for Jehovah's house.

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:43.940
Nowhere else does that happen, and if you tried to do it yourself.

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:49.940
If we hired somebody, it wouldn't be as good as the work that the friends do when they come in.

00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:53.940
When the friends come on the weekend, this is an educational facility.

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:56.940
So they come here to be educated about Jehovah,

00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:04.940
and new ones come, and it needs to be dignified and reflect Jehovah's qualities.

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:08.940
So the cleaning that goes on, the maintenance that goes on,

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:11.940
that's what the purpose is.

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:16.449
At lunchtime, we do a spiritual program.

00:35:16.449 --> 00:35:20.449
It could be a talk, could be a discussion.

00:35:20.449 --> 00:35:26.449
And we really generally try to cover a topic that helps the volunteers

00:35:26.449 --> 00:35:32.449
see the connection between their work at the Assembly Hall and Kingdom Preaching work.

00:35:32.449 --> 00:35:37.449
We are preachers, that's number one, to spread the good news.

00:35:37.449 --> 00:35:51.889
And we see the results of that here, we're filling this place up.

00:35:51.889 --> 00:35:57.889
It's a real privilege you learn so much from the sacrifices that the friends make

00:35:57.889 --> 00:36:01.889
in order to serve Jehovah, that it makes us feel very small,

00:36:01.889 --> 00:36:07.889
and we realize what a blessing it is for us to be in that environment all the time.

00:36:07.889 --> 00:36:11.889
The goal of any work in Jehovah's service is to help as many people as you can,

00:36:11.889 --> 00:36:16.889
to come to know him, and to take care of his interests here on the earth.

00:36:16.889 --> 00:36:25.250
And we all have the same goal, trying to please him, and doing what we can.

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:34.250
Our goal, really, as Assembly Hall servants, is to take care of the place in such a way,

00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:39.250
take care of the Assembly Hall in such a way that not only saves

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:43.250
and makes a wise use of dedicated funds and resources,

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:48.250
but also making things ready in such a way that on Saturday morning,

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:53.250
when the brothers and sisters walk in and the attendants and the sound and the stage brothers are getting ready,

00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:58.250
all they really have to do is come on, flip the switches, lights come on,

00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:01.250
air conditioning, heat, everything's functioning.

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:06.250
Where all they have to do is just focus on the program and listen and take an instruction.

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:08.250
That's what we're asked to do.

00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:10.250
Listen and take an instruction.

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:13.250
We can do that when we're not distracted by anything else.

00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:18.250
So if everything works well on the Assembly Day, we know we've done our job.

00:37:18.250 --> 00:37:28.590
We can remember these hardworking brothers and sisters in our prayers,

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:31.590
and we can do our part to help them.

00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:38.590
If possible, volunteer to assist with your congregations cleaning assignment at your next assembly.

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:43.590
Or ask about the arrangement for maintaining Assembly Halls in your area.

00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:48.590
A few are needed to take the lead, but they need our help to get the work done.

00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:54.840
The same is true with the great amount of work in the congregation.

00:37:54.840 --> 00:38:00.840
In our discussion about Jonathan, we mentioned the zealous example of our elders.

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:05.840
Are the elders leaders or do they take the lead?

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:07.840
What's the difference?

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:12.840
For the Jeffrey Jackson explains in this Bethel morning worship.

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:19.840
While meditating on the text this morning, I was reminded of an experience I had many years ago as a missionary.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:26.840
At the time I was studying with a young man who was training to be a pastor in his church.

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:35.840
This man had got to the point where he started to attend all our meetings while at the same time still attending his church gatherings.

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:41.840
The church obviously was very disturbed about the fact that he was coming to the meetings of Jehovah's Witnesses

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:47.840
and the headquarters sent in a missionary from overseas to try and rectify the situation.

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:49.840
The young man told me what happened.

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:55.840
He said the missionary asked him, what is it that impresses you about Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:59.840
He said, well, one of the things is that they do the preaching work.

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:04.840
The missionary replied, well, our church can do that too.

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:10.840
So the next time they had a service, the missionary conducted the service and with great zeal

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:16.840
and enthusiasm demanded that everyone in the church take part in the preaching work.

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:20.840
He announced the time that they would have the group to go preaching.

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:25.840
The young man told me quite a number of people came along, but there's just one thing missing.

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:28.840
You guessed it, the missionary.

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:35.840
He felt that it was enough just to encourage everybody else to do it without engaging in it himself.

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:44.840
How different was the example of Jesus and of our hardworking elders who do take the lead with regard to the preaching work?

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:53.840
Let's take our Bibles and turn to a very interesting scripture in Hebrews 13 and verse 7 and 17.

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:59.840
I'd like to highlight the beauty of the New World translation in these two verses.

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:05.840
You see at the beginning of verse 7, remember those who are taking the lead among you.

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:11.840
And then verse 17, be obedient to those who are taking the lead among you.

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:18.840
If you look at other Bibles, whether you or old, most of them say your leaders.

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:28.840
Now, obviously, the New World Transition Committee had in mind Jesus comments with regard to no one being a leader among us

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:36.840
and although it's a different word in the Greek text, I still in English, we can't help but be sensitive to that matter.

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:44.840
And so this accurate translation of saying taking the lead really summarizes, doesn't it, what the role is of an elder.

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:48.840
We're not leaders, but we set the right example.

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:58.840
Now, this accurate translation is also portrayed in the words of Lord Jesus Christ as recorded in Luke chapter 22.

00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:06.840
And you'll be interested to note that this is part of the revision of the New World Transition text, Luke 226.

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:17.840
It now portrays accurately the fact that both expressions in Hebrew and this one here are the same word.

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:29.840
So Luke chapter 22 verse 26 says, you though are not to be that way, but let the one who is the greatest among you become as the youngest.

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:32.840
And then notice and the one taking the lead.

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:38.840
Now, this is the same expression as in Hebrews as the one ministering.

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:47.840
So obviously, to take the lead means to do the work, to be a minister, to be a servant, to serve others.

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:55.840
This also reminds me many years ago when I worked with the translation team in the Pacific nation of Samoa.

00:41:55.840 --> 00:42:02.840
At that point, we were trying to select an accurate expression to convey this thought of taking the lead.

00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:11.840
And there were two words, eventually, that the brothers were trying to select between a choose between one was the word ta-i and the other ta-i-mua.

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:13.840
Now, you don't have to remember those words.

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:20.840
But as a foreigner, I didn't really understand the subtleties between the difference of the two words.

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:25.840
So I asked the brothers, how can you explain to me what these two words mean?

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:32.840
So one of the brothers was very eloquent, he said, well, just imagine a procession, a parade.

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:38.840
So ta-i is the old man who sits on the side of the road barking out the orders.

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:41.840
You should do it this way, you should do it that way.

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:49.840
The ta-i-mua, on the other hand, is the one right in the front of the parade, taking the lead, and everyone's following them.

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:52.840
Which word do you think we selected?

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:57.840
Doesn't that summarize nicely? Just exactly what's involved with being an elder.

00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:06.840
It's not a matter of sitting on the sidelines barking out orders, but getting involved, setting the right example, and then others following.

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:11.840
And this is in harmony with one Greek lexicon that describes this expression this way.

00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:21.840
It says, the concept of leading can be expressed by showing how to do something, demonstrating how we ought to do it, and going ahead showing the way.

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:29.840
Of course, on the other hand, some religions even view the expression elder as a title.

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:32.840
You've probably heard of them introducing themselves.

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:35.840
Good morning, I'm Elder Jackson.

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:44.840
But of course none of us would want to view being an elder as a title in the sense of a position that lords it over others.

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:51.840
And with that in mind, another subtlety to the revision is seen in 1st Timothy chapter 3.

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:54.840
So please turn there with me.

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:58.840
1st Timothy, chapter 3 and verse 1.

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:06.840
These are well-known words, particularly when our brothers are considering the qualifications for elders.

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:12.840
But you may or may not have seen the subtlety of the change here in this revision.

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:17.840
It says, now, this statement is trustworthy.

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:24.840
If a man is reaching out to be an overseer, he is desirous of a fine work.

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:34.840
Do you remember before the original New World Transition said, if someone is reaching out for the office of being an overseer?

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:43.840
And they're that reflected and know that was influenced by the King James and many of the older translations that translated it that way.

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:53.840
But when we look at the rest of the verse, we see that it's not the office or the position of being an overseer that someone reaches out for.

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:55.840
Rather, it's the work.

00:44:55.840 --> 00:45:00.840
Yes, the hard work that needs to be done by an overseer.

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:14.840
An overseer recognizes that he needs to work hard as setting a right example and then others will follow rather than just telling everyone what they should do.

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:21.840
So when we look at these subtlety in the New World Transition, it only helps us to appreciate it even more, doesn't it?

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:26.840
So if this in mind, what does that text this morning help us to keep in mind?

00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:30.840
Well, as elders, what do we need to do?

00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:44.840
Not sit on the sidelines barking out orders, but rather to take the lead, be in the forefront, do the work and then others will follow our example just as we follow the example of Jesus.

00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:50.840
The Bible gives us a clear understanding of what Jehovah wants us to do in the congregation.

00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:58.250
Elders take the lead by doing the work and we follow their good example.

00:45:58.250 --> 00:46:04.250
Applying God's Word contributes to our being fellow workers under peaceful conditions.

00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:10.250
But we could be distracted even when our brothers and sisters are right there with us.

00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:26.539
What are these distractions? Let's see in this music video.

00:46:33.539 --> 00:46:37.539
Because you know that there's much more to life.

00:46:37.539 --> 00:46:43.539
A friend requesting likes. Think of all the things we haven't seen.

00:46:43.539 --> 00:46:48.539
Well, yeah, you'll never see them if you're focused on a superficial.

00:46:48.539 --> 00:47:18.460
You need real friends if you know what I might see around the world.

00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:22.460
Take the time to see. See what others see.

00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:25.460
Don't trade that plastic box for all your friends.

00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:29.460
You can make friends you know are true.

00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:32.460
You'd love Jehovah too.

00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:36.460
And stand right by your side until the end, but yeah.

00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:41.460
You'll never meet them if you're focused on a superficial.

00:47:41.460 --> 00:50:14.699
You need real friends if you know what I might see around the world.

00:50:14.699 --> 00:50:18.699
Time spent with our brothers and sisters is precious.

00:50:18.699 --> 00:50:24.699
Make the most of it by setting aside anything that could distract from the interchange of encouragement.

00:50:24.699 --> 00:50:34.300
Sometimes though, our viewpoint of ones in the congregation hides their true beauty that Jehovah sees.

00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:38.300
How does the sister in this dramatization learn that lesson?

00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:42.300
And in turn, become more beautiful herself.

00:50:42.300 --> 00:51:08.309
My name is Mickey. I moved here one year ago.

00:51:08.309 --> 00:51:24.300
Everyone was so nice and friendly. That's how I felt in the beginning.

00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:40.889
I am not your babysitter.

00:51:40.889 --> 00:51:51.019
Didn't you see we were talking?

00:51:51.019 --> 00:52:05.159
Come on. This is not a park.

00:52:05.159 --> 00:52:10.440
And the elders are always busy.

00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:13.440
I'm not sure if they really want me here.

00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:30.380
Yoko, a pioneer sister from my former congregation visited me.

00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:32.380
She asked me how I was doing.

00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:39.260
I told her how I feel about my congregation.

00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:43.260
Then she told me that she had a similar experience.

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:47.260
And she shared with me a watchtower article that helped her.

00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:53.050
I made this my next personal study project.

00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:59.769
What do you see when you look at others?

00:52:59.769 --> 00:53:03.769
Do you have the tendency to view what they say or do as either black or white?

00:53:03.769 --> 00:53:08.139
As if no other colors or shades existed?

00:53:08.139 --> 00:53:15.869
Having that viewpoint would be like a photographer who ignores the large variety

00:53:15.869 --> 00:53:19.869
of brilliant hues and shades in an autumn landscape.

00:53:19.869 --> 00:53:22.869
As if only black and white images existed.

00:53:22.869 --> 00:53:35.719
Maybe I've been viewing the congregation as black and white.

00:53:35.719 --> 00:53:39.719
The article then turned my attention to Jesus example.

00:53:39.719 --> 00:53:44.449
The spirit of course is eager.

00:53:44.449 --> 00:53:51.510
But the flesh is weak.

00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:55.510
Why was Jesus able to say such kind words to his disciples?

00:53:55.510 --> 00:54:09.909
Insight is the ability to put yourself in the others place.

00:54:09.909 --> 00:54:12.909
Jesus did that with his disciples.

00:54:12.909 --> 00:54:16.909
Okay, I need to do the same.

00:54:16.909 --> 00:54:19.909
She always looks after the children at home.

00:54:19.909 --> 00:54:24.909
She also needs time to be refreshed by association with friends at the kingdom hall.

00:54:24.909 --> 00:54:28.909
She probably didn't mean to be rude.

00:54:28.909 --> 00:54:32.909
Since we looked like we were having an enjoyable conversation,

00:54:32.909 --> 00:54:36.909
she may have just wanted to join us.

00:54:36.909 --> 00:54:40.909
The elders are so busy caring for the needs of the congregation.

00:54:40.909 --> 00:54:43.909
I know they're doing the best they can.

00:54:43.909 --> 00:54:46.909
I want to do what I can to make their job easier.

00:54:46.909 --> 00:55:17.690
You are such a beautiful Christian.

00:55:17.690 --> 00:55:20.690
We're so glad to have you in our congregation.

00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:32.150
The inside of a man certainly slows down his anger.

00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:46.909
And it is beauty on his part to overlook an offense.

00:55:46.909 --> 00:55:51.909
If you'd like to make this less than a topic for your personal study or family worship,

00:55:51.909 --> 00:55:58.909
you can review the March 15th, 2008 Watchtower article, beginning on page 25.

00:55:58.909 --> 00:56:04.909
The title asks the question, do you view others as Jehovah does?

00:56:04.909 --> 00:56:06.909
When we shared Jehovah's view of others,

00:56:06.909 --> 00:56:11.909
we're better equipped to be fellow workers with God and with our brothers and sisters.

00:56:11.909 --> 00:56:20.260
Finally, this month's report from fellow workers comes to us from the country of Georgia.

00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:28.260
Forest, streams, and lush valleys adorn this mountainous region on the border of Europe and Asia.

00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:36.260
Georgia's capital, Tbilisi, is a bustling city where modern buildings mix with historic architecture.

00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:43.260
The Georgian people are known for their strong family ties and warm hospitality.

00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:47.260
Folk music and dances are a rich part of their culture.

00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:52.260
Visitors are offered to try a variety of delicious local foods,

00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:56.260
such as this candy made from walnuts and grape juice.

00:56:56.260 --> 00:57:03.260
Old Town Signagi is a unique place to enjoy the beautiful landscape and culture.

00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:08.260
The congregation here has 50 publishers who keep busy in the preaching work.

00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:15.260
Despite being a small congregation, they represent almost 3% of the town's population.

00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:23.260
Remote towns and villages create opportunities to preach in unassigned territories throughout the year.

00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:30.260
We thank the congregation in Signagi and the more than 18,000 brothers and sisters in Georgia

00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:33.260
for this encouraging visit with them.

00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:39.260
And we send them and all of you, our warm Christian love and greetings.

00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:44.260
From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.
