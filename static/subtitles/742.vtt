WEBVTT

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.919
Now, we have the opportunity to enjoy this edition

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:13.359
that we're accustomed to of the inside story,

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:16.199
and it's hosted by another instructor,

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.719
Brother Trent Liphole.

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:46.299
Enjoy it.

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:48.100
The past year has been a period of change

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.179
for all of Jehovah's people.

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:55.179
We've had to show flexibility, caution, and reasonableness.

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:58.619
Here at Gilead, for us too, Class 150

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:00.659
has presented us with change.

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:04.019
For example, all the students of Class 150

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.459
are from or serving in the United States.

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:09.739
Five couples in one single brother

00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:12.180
all serve in the circuit work.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.060
That represents approximately 50% of the class.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.219
Today, we're going to meet three couples

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:20.659
from different parts of the United States

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.379
and see how they learn to cope with change in their lives.

00:01:24.379 --> 00:01:27.540
And how they, like the Apostle Paul,

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.739
worked to become all things to all people.

00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:32.420
So let's meet our first guests,

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.219
Joey and Taylor Bornshine, from the state of Texas.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.010
Joey and Taylor, welcome to the inside story.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.010
Great to have you with us.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.849
Thank you.

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:53.969
You're from the big state of Texas.

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:55.730
Where specifically are you from?

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.049
From Dallas.

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:58.609
Dallas, Texas, all right.

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:01.049
Well, again, nice to have you with us.

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.290
You know, to come to Gilead, here you are in the 150th class,

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.450
and it all starts with regular pioneering.

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:08.969
So how did you both start regular pioneering,

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:10.770
maybe Joey, how did you start?

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.849
So for me, I feel very grateful that my foundation

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.169
starts a long time ago with my family,

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:19.050
especially with my grandparents.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.129
They were the couple that, after they got married,

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.050
they really just wanted to serve Jehovah the best way they could.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.729
They would ask circuit overseers

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:28.810
where they could move that needed help.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.889
If they were ever asked to go to another congregation,

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:33.849
they would always do it right away.

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.169
And so that really affected my mom,

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:37.729
which in turn affected me.

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:39.930
How did that affect you?

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.449
So for a while, after my parents got married,

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:45.490
they might have just gotten a little distracted

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.770
with marriage, family, taking care of the family.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.810
But at one point, they made a move across the country.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.289
And they used that as an opportunity to simplify.

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:58.650
And my mom was able to start regular pioneering at that time.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.449
And I just, I remember as a child,

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:03.849
how different both of my parents were,

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.610
just in their happiness and in life in general,

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.930
because she was able to do more for Jehovah.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:10.849
Nice.

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:12.810
How old were you when that happened

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.050
when your mom started pioneering

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.449
and you saw this change?

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:16.490
I was about nine.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:17.250
OK.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.930
And so when did you start regular pioneering then?

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.729
So actually, the next year, my sister

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:25.610
and I both got to join her pioneering.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.930
So you were 10 years old.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:28.930
That is amazing.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.530
10 years old started pioneering.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:31.370
Great.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.810
What about you, Taylor, how did you

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:35.889
get your start in regular pioneering?

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:39.849
So we pioneered in Texas, but I'm originally from Colorado.

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:43.370
So my parents, like Joey, said a really good example for me.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.930
Most of my life, they pioneered as a couple.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.050
And so pioneering was always just something, full-time service

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.169
was something that I grew up with.

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:52.650
Then I was in my mid teens.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.250
My parents got appointed into this substitute circuit work.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.330
That was fun.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.930
On the weekends, I would travel with them

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.129
to visit congregations.

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:01.090
I was in public schools.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.770
I couldn't go with them during the week.

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.169
And I appreciated about them.

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:06.849
That it wasn't just what they said,

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.770
but they set the example by what they did.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.330
OK, I mean, that must have been cool.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.729
You got to be parents from there in the substitute circuit work.

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:15.330
But personally, how did that affect you?

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.930
Yeah, so that was just some good motivation

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.209
for me to start pioneering.

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.769
I graduated about six months early,

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.209
a semester early, and then started pioneering.

00:04:23.209 --> 00:04:25.730
And then as soon as I was able to, I hit 19

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.889
and submitted an application for Bethel.

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:29.410
And soon thereafter, I was accepted

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.649
and was able to spend a few years in Brooklyn.

00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:32.649
OK.

00:04:32.649 --> 00:04:36.009
After that, I know you left Bethel a tube you got married,

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:39.930
or you're there, regular pioneering in Dallas.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.410
What made the difference for you,

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.850
for you to reach out and progress in Jehovah's Service?

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.730
So we were pioneering as a young couple.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.649
We had goals, but it can be hard when you're new,

00:04:50.649 --> 00:04:53.089
trying to figure marriage out, some distractions,

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:55.970
or maybe even just knowing what direction you should take.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.689
So we just feel so thankful to Jehovah,

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:59.810
whether we had some very instrumental circuit

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.689
overseer couples that came just at the right time.

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:06.250
We've tried to express it to them,

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.370
but I don't think they'll ever fully understand

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.490
the impact that they've had on our lives.

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.050
Well, that is one of the great things

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.810
about the impact of those in the circuit work,

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.290
what they do for young people, for young ones.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.649
And I think we're all so grateful for that.

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:22.329
Would you say then that was that your inspiration

00:05:22.329 --> 00:05:24.490
to get into the circuit work?

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.689
Not really.

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:28.730
We actually had different goals.

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.769
We really wanted to go to Bethel together as a couple.

00:05:31.769 --> 00:05:35.410
So we applied and applied, and it just didn't seem to happen.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.569
But you ended up in the circuit work.

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:39.970
So I wonder what changed then,

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.170
did it just grow on you or what happened?

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:43.970
Well, one day we opened up a piece of mail,

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.209
and it was a questionnaire for the substitute circuit work.

00:05:48.209 --> 00:05:50.970
So while that might not have been the direction

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.250
that we thought we would go down,

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.410
it seemed like that was the path

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:54.889
that Jehovah laid out in front of us.

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:56.129
So we happily accepted.

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:58.370
And little by little, it started to grow on us,

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:59.730
the idea of the circuit work.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.170
We were then able to attend school

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.050
for kingdom evangelizers,

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.889
where it just continued to get training,

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:08.970
motivation to do what Jehovah wants us to do.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.649
And so after our graduation,

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:11.730
within just a few months,

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.449
we were appointed into the circuit work,

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:16.889
and we love the circuit work.

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:18.449
Where was your first circuit, Joy?

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:20.930
So we went to the suburbs of Chicago.

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.850
So it was great, big city of Dallas,

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.769
to the big city of Chicago.

00:06:24.769 --> 00:06:27.610
What did you think of Chicago?

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.649
It was everything that I could want in a circuit.

00:06:30.649 --> 00:06:33.410
So two big city people from Dallas,

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.209
now to Chicago, even bigger city.

00:06:35.209 --> 00:06:36.810
We love diversity,

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.889
love background, culture, race,

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:39.889
and it had everything.

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:41.050
So we were just eating it up.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.970
We loved being in the Chicago area.

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.329
It sounds like a butt's coming for change.

00:06:46.329 --> 00:06:48.410
What changed for you both?

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.370
So after just about six months of being in that circuit,

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.449
still falling in love with the circuit work,

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:55.329
we got to call from the branch office,

00:06:55.329 --> 00:06:56.730
that we were now being reassigned

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:58.129
to a different circuit,

00:06:58.129 --> 00:06:59.329
further north,

00:06:59.329 --> 00:07:03.050
and a more rural circuit in Wisconsin.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:04.370
Okay, Wisconsin.

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.170
Well, what did you think?

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:07.009
Tell us about it.

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:09.730
What was Wisconsin like for you Taylor?

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.529
So very different,

00:07:11.529 --> 00:07:14.370
big city people going into a rural circuit

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:18.209
that was mostly dairy farm communities.

00:07:18.209 --> 00:07:20.529
So out of my element,

00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:22.689
we would drive for miles and miles

00:07:22.689 --> 00:07:23.689
when we were out in service,

00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:28.329
no stores or shops or bathrooms or coffee shops.

00:07:28.329 --> 00:07:30.529
So it was a little getting used to.

00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:32.810
Timing was probably now became something you had to learn.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:33.649
Right, good.

00:07:33.649 --> 00:07:35.889
What about for you Joey coming from Dallas?

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:37.769
What was it like for you?

00:07:37.769 --> 00:07:41.730
For me, the big change was the weather, the winters.

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:43.889
We didn't have extreme winters in Dallas

00:07:43.889 --> 00:07:47.730
and Wisconsin had very long, very cold winters.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:51.610
So we invested in really good coats, wool leggings,

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:53.329
great boots.

00:07:53.329 --> 00:07:55.689
I jokingly told Taylor some mornings I would wake up

00:07:55.689 --> 00:07:58.129
and feel exhausted just getting dressed in the morning.

00:07:58.129 --> 00:08:00.649
Putting on so much, I guess that also affected

00:08:00.649 --> 00:08:02.889
bathroom breaks and things like that.

00:08:02.889 --> 00:08:04.930
New skills you're learning in Wisconsin.

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:05.610
Right.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:09.449
What helped you to adjust to this new change?

00:08:09.449 --> 00:08:12.089
So although it was a different environment,

00:08:12.089 --> 00:08:15.490
it was just beautiful to see that it was cold outside,

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.449
but that didn't affect the friends, their hearts,

00:08:17.449 --> 00:08:20.089
they were warm and their service to Jehovah,

00:08:20.089 --> 00:08:23.170
they were so warm in the way that they treated us.

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:26.689
It just adopted us so quickly into a different environment.

00:08:26.689 --> 00:08:29.610
Are we very, very quickly fell in love

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:31.410
with the friends in Wisconsin?

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:33.250
Jehovah's people are amazing, aren't they?

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:34.450
What about you, Joey?

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:36.730
What would you say helped you to adjust?

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:38.370
Well, of course, like Taylor said,

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:41.250
the love from the friends it helped us immediately.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:44.129
But we also actually learned new waves to have fun

00:08:44.129 --> 00:08:46.090
that we never did in Dallas.

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:48.289
Yeah, you brought a picture, this photograph,

00:08:48.289 --> 00:08:50.809
great picture, obviously having fun there.

00:08:50.809 --> 00:08:52.450
Joey, what can you tell us about it?

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:55.169
So this is actually a gathering that we went to

00:08:55.169 --> 00:08:57.210
on the middle of a frozen lake.

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.009
And this is actually a size fishing.

00:08:59.009 --> 00:08:59.929
Did you catch anything?

00:08:59.929 --> 00:09:00.929
We did.

00:09:00.929 --> 00:09:02.649
You're telling yourself you're not in Dallas.

00:09:02.649 --> 00:09:03.850
It was great.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:04.649
Great.

00:09:04.649 --> 00:09:06.970
There's also another photo, and I love this one.

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:08.970
What can you tell us about this Taylor?

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:10.169
So there's a brother in the circuit

00:09:10.169 --> 00:09:11.929
who raised beef cattle.

00:09:11.929 --> 00:09:14.970
So I got to spend some time getting to pet the little guy

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:16.490
and also a hand feeding it.

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:18.970
So amazing experience, not something

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:22.370
that I would have been able to do in downtown Chicago

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:23.450
or downtown Dallas.

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:25.409
If you're really there just becoming all things

00:09:25.409 --> 00:09:29.649
to all people, what would you say you learned

00:09:29.649 --> 00:09:33.730
from the changes you've gone through in your lives?

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:36.009
So if I'm just being honest, the circuit work was not

00:09:36.009 --> 00:09:38.570
something that I had a desire to do.

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:43.289
I didn't feel like it would make me comfortable or happy.

00:09:43.289 --> 00:09:46.289
But Jehovah at times puts things in front of us

00:09:46.289 --> 00:09:48.009
that we might not think that we would like

00:09:48.009 --> 00:09:51.169
or make us comfortable, but it does.

00:09:51.169 --> 00:09:53.289
And I'm so glad that he did allow us

00:09:53.289 --> 00:09:55.809
to have the opportunity to be into the circuit work

00:09:55.809 --> 00:09:58.450
because we love the circuit work.

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:01.409
So just a nice little reminder that Jehovah will choose things

00:10:01.409 --> 00:10:02.970
for us or put things in front of us

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:05.289
that maybe we don't think is going to make us happy

00:10:05.289 --> 00:10:07.610
or it's not going to make us comfortable

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:10.450
and how we feel with a circumstance or environment.

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:12.809
But that Jehovah always chooses what's best for us

00:10:12.809 --> 00:10:14.809
if we just let him do it.

00:10:14.809 --> 00:10:17.370
What would you say, Joey, what did you learn?

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:20.049
I think for me, anytime there's a change,

00:10:20.049 --> 00:10:22.210
there's always going to be a little bit of anxiety

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:24.049
and certain tease worries.

00:10:24.049 --> 00:10:27.169
I just really learned to just leave it in Jehovah's hands

00:10:27.169 --> 00:10:29.210
to pray to him about it because a lot of times

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:30.649
those things never even happen.

00:10:30.649 --> 00:10:32.409
They never even come true.

00:10:32.409 --> 00:10:35.049
So whatever Jehovah asks of us,

00:10:35.049 --> 00:10:36.370
we will be able to get through it

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:38.850
because either they won't happen

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.769
or Jehovah will help us and bless us through them.

00:10:41.769 --> 00:10:43.730
Those are two great lessons that you learned.

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:45.330
Thank you so much for sharing them with us.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.450
And those are two lessons that will probably help you out

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:50.970
in the changes that are to come in your life.

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:52.210
Taylor and Joey, thank you so much

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:53.649
for being with us on the Inside Story.

00:10:53.649 --> 00:10:55.409
Thank you.

00:10:55.409 --> 00:10:59.049
Let's welcome our next guests coming from the state of Michigan,

00:10:59.049 --> 00:11:13.490
Ben and Whitney Fry.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:14.850
Ben and Whitney, thank you for being with us

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:16.289
on the Inside Story.

00:11:16.289 --> 00:11:19.529
You've come to Gilead from the circuit work

00:11:19.529 --> 00:11:23.009
and the circuit work also starts with regular pioneering.

00:11:23.009 --> 00:11:24.649
So maybe you can tell us, how did you, Whitney,

00:11:24.649 --> 00:11:26.570
how did you start regular pioneering?

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:29.330
So my mom taught me the truth when I was growing up

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.169
and I loved Jehovah, but by late teens,

00:11:32.169 --> 00:11:34.929
I didn't really know what I wanted to do with my life.

00:11:34.929 --> 00:11:37.889
I had a girlfriend who invited me to support her

00:11:37.889 --> 00:11:39.850
at a funeral of a young brother

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:42.330
who had passed away in a tragic accident.

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:43.289
That's interesting.

00:11:43.289 --> 00:11:45.529
Maybe you could make, what's the connection

00:11:45.529 --> 00:11:47.769
starting pioneering of a funeral?

00:11:47.769 --> 00:11:49.409
Maybe you could make the connection for us.

00:11:49.409 --> 00:11:51.970
Yeah, so for me, when I got to the funeral

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:54.370
of this young brother, even though I didn't know him personally,

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:57.090
I had seen that he had just started regular pioneering

00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:58.450
and he had the goal of going to Bethel

00:11:58.450 --> 00:11:59.850
when he got old enough.

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:02.289
And I just compared his life to mine.

00:12:02.289 --> 00:12:04.690
He was going to give everything he had to Jehovah

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.730
and I had the circumstances to do the same thing,

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:09.129
but I wasn't doing it.

00:12:09.129 --> 00:12:12.210
And so I just thought he didn't get to finish his story.

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:15.169
So I wanted to pick up where he left off.

00:12:15.169 --> 00:12:16.809
I wanted to start pioneering.

00:12:16.809 --> 00:12:19.210
And so when I went home, I prayed about it

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:21.690
and I turned in my auxiliary pioneer application

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:24.009
with the goal of starting regular in September.

00:12:24.009 --> 00:12:26.250
Well, that's really encouraging something so tragic

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:28.529
and yet something very positive came out of it.

00:12:28.529 --> 00:12:29.370
What about you, Ben?

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:30.570
How did you get your start?

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:33.210
So similar to Whitney, my mother taught me the truth.

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:35.809
My dad was not in the truth during my youth.

00:12:35.809 --> 00:12:39.250
I grew up in a rural congregation in Michigan.

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:42.730
And while I respected the truth in my late teens,

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:46.330
early 20s, I struggled spiritually.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:49.970
And the reason being is because I wanted a lot out of life.

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:53.409
And at that point, the truth felt very restrictive to me.

00:12:53.409 --> 00:12:55.049
It felt like it was holding me back

00:12:55.049 --> 00:12:57.809
and not allowing me to get the rich life that I wanted.

00:12:57.809 --> 00:12:59.210
What changed in your life, then?

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:00.970
What helped you?

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:02.490
We had a couple pioneer elders

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:05.049
move into our congregation who were a great source

00:13:05.049 --> 00:13:06.450
of encouragement to me.

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:08.009
They helped me to see that serving Jehovah,

00:13:08.009 --> 00:13:10.250
it's not about what you can't do.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:12.850
It's about all the things you can do.

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:15.929
And the way I illustrated is with a board game,

00:13:15.929 --> 00:13:18.850
if all you did was just learn the rules of that game,

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:22.250
but you never played it, that wouldn't be a lot of fun.

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:24.850
And that's really how my view was at that time

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:25.570
of the truth.

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:28.009
I knew the rules, so to speak, of the truth.

00:13:28.009 --> 00:13:31.769
I respected the truth, but I wasn't involved in it.

00:13:31.769 --> 00:13:33.330
So with the encouragement of these two brothers,

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.129
I really got involved.

00:13:35.129 --> 00:13:37.009
I started playing the game, so to speak.

00:13:37.009 --> 00:13:40.450
And I started studying the Bible like I should have all along.

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:43.769
And then I also started regular pioneering shortly thereafter.

00:13:43.769 --> 00:13:46.370
Nice, well, we're happy you got in the game.

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:48.129
Was there anything else Whitney that helped you

00:13:48.129 --> 00:13:51.649
or maybe inspired you to reach out?

00:13:51.649 --> 00:13:54.250
Yeah, when I started wanting to pioneer,

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:56.970
I also got into more studying.

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:58.690
And one thing that really affected me

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:00.929
was the video to the ends of the earth.

00:14:00.929 --> 00:14:01.970
I remember watching it.

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:05.049
And as I'm watching it thinking, that's it.

00:14:05.049 --> 00:14:05.889
That's what I want to do.

00:14:05.889 --> 00:14:08.370
I want to go to Gilead and I want to be a missionary.

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:09.210
Very nice.

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:12.529
Well, that video is still available on jw.org

00:14:12.529 --> 00:14:13.970
on the video library.

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:16.649
And probably that video, like yourselves,

00:14:16.649 --> 00:14:20.129
inspired hundreds of people to reach out

00:14:20.129 --> 00:14:23.970
and enter missionary service to attend Gilead.

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.330
And many of them are still out there

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.850
strengthening and stabilizing the brotherhood.

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:35.049
So you both then had the goal of foreign service, missionary service.

00:14:35.049 --> 00:14:37.009
Did you keep pursuing that goal?

00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:38.210
Yeah, we certainly did.

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:40.250
After we got married six months later,

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:41.889
we served where the need was great

00:14:41.889 --> 00:14:44.210
in the country of Guyana and South America.

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:45.289
Nice.

00:14:45.289 --> 00:14:47.330
And you brought along a couple of pictures.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:48.850
Maybe you can explain these.

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:50.889
Well, the first one's obviously that's your photo, Ben.

00:14:50.889 --> 00:14:51.769
What can you tell us?

00:14:51.769 --> 00:14:55.129
Yeah, so we were motivated by the motorbike scene

00:14:55.129 --> 00:14:57.090
in the ends of the Earth video.

00:14:57.090 --> 00:15:00.129
So we got a motorbike when we were down there,

00:15:00.129 --> 00:15:02.090
not quite as big or as cool as the one

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:04.450
in the ends of the Earth video.

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:06.169
But this served its purpose.

00:15:06.169 --> 00:15:08.289
We were able to travel the territory efficiently

00:15:08.289 --> 00:15:10.490
through our different Bible studies and return visits.

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:11.370
Good.

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:15.210
And the next photo, what can you tell us about it, Whitney?

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:17.529
So when the bike couldn't take us any farther,

00:15:17.529 --> 00:15:19.250
we would park it and then we walked

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:22.649
in a lot of times that meant through mud across the trenches.

00:15:22.649 --> 00:15:23.490
Like, we didn't mind.

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:24.330
It was fun.

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:25.289
We were enjoying it.

00:15:25.289 --> 00:15:26.929
So Ben's been careful on the bridge.

00:15:26.929 --> 00:15:29.690
Yeah, you had to be careful because there were black camein,

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:32.210
which is a form of alligator that were in those trenches.

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:35.090
So you chose your steps carefully.

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:37.409
Well, I know, Sue, you came back from Guyana.

00:15:37.409 --> 00:15:39.169
Did you continue to pursue Gilead?

00:15:39.169 --> 00:15:39.769
We did.

00:15:39.769 --> 00:15:41.330
Once we returned to the United States

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:44.730
after serving in Guyana, we applied for Gilead.

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:46.690
And to our surprise, we were invited

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:50.090
to serve as special pioneers in the state of West Virginia

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:51.450
here in the United States.

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:53.529
OK, so did Gilead remain your goal, though,

00:15:53.529 --> 00:15:55.529
even though you're there in West Virginia?

00:15:55.529 --> 00:15:56.049
It did.

00:15:56.049 --> 00:15:58.490
We continued to apply for Gilead.

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:00.129
But then instead, we were invited

00:16:00.129 --> 00:16:02.250
to the Bible school for Christian couples.

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:02.769
Very nice.

00:16:02.769 --> 00:16:05.649
So more theocratic education, though.

00:16:05.649 --> 00:16:09.690
And from there, you returned to West Virginia?

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:10.370
That's correct.

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:13.529
So we continued special pioneering in West Virginia,

00:16:13.529 --> 00:16:16.009
and we also got training for circuit work.

00:16:16.009 --> 00:16:16.690
Good.

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:18.570
Did you end up in the circuit work?

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:21.490
So we were invited to start circuit work

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:24.570
in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin area, similar close

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:25.850
bite of the Borenchein.

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:26.649
And we loved it.

00:16:26.649 --> 00:16:28.769
We loved the friends there, and we loved that circuit.

00:16:28.769 --> 00:16:29.809
Nice.

00:16:29.809 --> 00:16:32.690
But of course, change came, didn't it?

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:34.090
A big change for you?

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:36.169
Yeah, so one day Ben came home.

00:16:36.169 --> 00:16:37.450
We've been there about four years.

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:38.610
We're loving it.

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:40.769
And he came home and told me that we

00:16:40.769 --> 00:16:43.210
got field missionary applications.

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:45.129
There it is, foreign service.

00:16:45.129 --> 00:16:45.929
So how did you feel?

00:16:45.929 --> 00:16:47.730
Ben, how did you feel?

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:50.129
At that point in our life, we were really

00:16:50.129 --> 00:16:51.490
enjoying circuit work.

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:53.769
And we loved the friends.

00:16:53.769 --> 00:16:55.929
So admittedly, at that point, the idea

00:16:55.929 --> 00:16:59.250
of now going foreign and having another change,

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:01.090
maybe lost a bit of its luster.

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:02.649
And we had gotten so comfortable.

00:17:02.649 --> 00:17:04.849
We had potentially gotten too comfortable.

00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:06.329
What about you, Whitney?

00:17:06.329 --> 00:17:08.890
Yeah, I thought, you know, that had always been my goal.

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:12.529
But now, Jehovah, now, after I got into circuit work,

00:17:12.529 --> 00:17:15.450
I was enjoying it, now you want me to go foreign.

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:17.730
So what helped you?

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:19.849
So we were explaining what was happening

00:17:19.849 --> 00:17:21.930
and talking to my family, telling them how we feel.

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:24.849
I was talking to my sister and my brother-in-law.

00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:27.130
And he said, you know, what you feel like you got trained

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:29.329
for circuit work, but maybe circuit work

00:17:29.329 --> 00:17:31.609
was training you for the next assignment.

00:17:31.609 --> 00:17:34.289
And just shifting my thoughts in that way really helped me.

00:17:34.289 --> 00:17:36.089
Yeah, that's great advice.

00:17:36.089 --> 00:17:36.930
What about you, Ben?

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:38.569
Was there something particularly that helped you?

00:17:38.569 --> 00:17:39.089
There it was.

00:17:39.089 --> 00:17:42.250
I spoke with a brother in the service department at Bethel.

00:17:42.289 --> 00:17:43.970
And he said that ones in our situation

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:46.609
come across his desk frequently.

00:17:46.609 --> 00:17:49.009
And he said, you're at a crossroads.

00:17:49.009 --> 00:17:51.450
And there are some who turned down the opportunity

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:53.890
to accept this form of foreign service.

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:56.250
He said, but for those that accept it,

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:58.529
who take that step of faith,

00:17:58.529 --> 00:18:02.289
they receive blessings that they could never have imagined

00:18:02.289 --> 00:18:03.569
from Jehovah.

00:18:03.569 --> 00:18:07.250
And we can rightly say, that has been completely accurate.

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:09.009
We feel exactly that way.

00:18:09.009 --> 00:18:10.690
Well, it shows.

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:12.250
So you went off into a foreign assignment.

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:15.410
You continued in circuit work there.

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:19.529
What would you say, Whitney, how did foreign service help you?

00:18:19.529 --> 00:18:20.930
So many ways.

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:22.930
But a couple of them are just getting

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:25.450
to express our faith and trust in Jehovah

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:28.250
in a way that we never would have if we didn't go.

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:31.049
And one of the greatest gifts was the people that we met,

00:18:31.049 --> 00:18:32.890
the local brothers and sisters,

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:35.369
our fellow missionaries and circuit overseers.

00:18:35.369 --> 00:18:38.410
Their faith in self-sacrifice taught us so much.

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:39.210
Beautiful.

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:40.890
And now you've come to Gilead.

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:43.210
How has Gilead training helped you?

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:44.369
Again, so many ways.

00:18:44.369 --> 00:18:47.490
But while we loved our foreign assignment,

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:48.890
it did have challenges.

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:50.650
And I remember praying to Jehovah,

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:52.210
asking him for help with certain things

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:53.650
that I struggled with.

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:55.690
And the first week that we were here in Gilead,

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:58.329
I saw the answer to those prayers, specific things

00:18:58.329 --> 00:19:01.529
that I had prayed about answered right in week one.

00:19:01.529 --> 00:19:03.089
And it never stopped since.

00:19:03.089 --> 00:19:04.930
Yeah, and I'm sure Gilead training will just

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:07.009
keep helping you in the future.

00:19:07.009 --> 00:19:08.410
You said at the outset, Ben, that you

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:10.250
wanted to get a lot out of life.

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:11.569
And I think we would all agree.

00:19:11.569 --> 00:19:15.089
You've gotten a lot out of life, both of you so far.

00:19:15.089 --> 00:19:17.730
And maybe the next 30 minutes, you'll find just out

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:20.009
just how much more of life you're going to get.

00:19:20.009 --> 00:19:22.369
Thank you both for being with us on the Inside Story.

00:19:22.369 --> 00:19:23.609
Thank you.

00:19:23.609 --> 00:19:25.410
Let's welcome our final guests.

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:27.289
They're also serving in the United States.

00:19:27.289 --> 00:19:41.630
It's Joshua and Saladi Rechenek.

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:42.789
Joshua and Saladi, welcome.

00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:43.990
It's nice to have you.

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:46.069
You're a final guest on the Inside Story for today.

00:19:46.069 --> 00:19:47.950
And I should clarify, although you're

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:49.670
serving the United States, you are actually

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:51.990
from Puerto Rico, correct?

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:54.670
That's right, which is a beautiful tropical island

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:56.190
in the Caribbean.

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:59.950
So my mom and dad moved there before I was born and to serve.

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:02.509
And that's where I was raised.

00:20:02.509 --> 00:20:04.190
And they were a tremendous example

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:06.430
for entering full-time service for me.

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:08.829
Because when I was one, they actually

00:20:08.829 --> 00:20:10.150
started in the circuit work.

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:13.430
So it's just from a very young age,

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:16.190
it just seemed very natural to have that as a goal.

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:17.349
And I'm very grateful.

00:20:18.309 --> 00:20:22.150
Saladi, you also born and raised in Puerto Rico?

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:23.309
That is right.

00:20:23.309 --> 00:20:25.509
I have an older brother, Tafi.

00:20:25.509 --> 00:20:31.029
And we both were raised by our mom, Lydia, as a single parent.

00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:32.990
She raised us in the truth.

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:36.549
And a little bit after Joshua came to our congregation,

00:20:36.549 --> 00:20:38.589
I started to pioneer.

00:20:38.589 --> 00:20:42.670
And also I had the privilege to serve as commuter

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:45.269
in Puerto Rico, right?

00:20:45.309 --> 00:20:49.309
But we were happy to have him in our congregation,

00:20:49.309 --> 00:20:50.630
but something happened.

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:52.470
OK, before we get to what happened,

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:53.670
we have a nice photograph.

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:54.190
There it is.

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:56.029
So that's you with your mom, Saladi?

00:20:56.029 --> 00:20:57.710
Yes, my mom, Lydia.

00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:59.549
So Josh, just to clarify this also,

00:20:59.549 --> 00:21:02.190
how did you get to Saladi's congregation?

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:03.950
So after I started pioneering, I

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:06.710
went to what was called the Ministerial Training School

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:08.029
in 2003.

00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:09.390
And after a little bit, I got assigned

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:12.390
to this lovely rural congregation,

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:15.230
where I just happened to meet a very beautiful sister.

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:17.349
I liked the way you say lovely congregation.

00:21:17.349 --> 00:21:18.269
Yes.

00:21:18.269 --> 00:21:19.069
But a change came.

00:21:19.069 --> 00:21:21.230
You said, Saladi, something changed.

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:23.109
What changed?

00:21:23.109 --> 00:21:25.549
Well, I had gotten some training as a substitute circuit

00:21:25.549 --> 00:21:26.630
over here.

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:31.069
And then there was a need for a circuit over here.

00:21:31.069 --> 00:21:32.309
But it wasn't in Puerto Rico.

00:21:32.309 --> 00:21:35.150
It was in a Spanish circuit in Ohio.

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:36.589
And so I prayed about it.

00:21:36.589 --> 00:21:39.670
And off I went from Puerto Rico to Ohio.

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:40.750
What was that like, Josh?

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:41.470
Tell us about it.

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:43.630
How did you feel when you got there?

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:45.789
I was very different.

00:21:45.789 --> 00:21:48.309
I remember dropping my dad off at the airport

00:21:48.309 --> 00:21:50.150
because he helped me move up.

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:53.269
And then when I was driving away, I said, I know nobody

00:21:53.269 --> 00:21:56.390
and nothing even nearby after that plane takes off.

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:58.750
Because not only the place was different,

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:00.829
but everything was different.

00:22:00.829 --> 00:22:02.789
It's very interesting because the congregations

00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:06.670
in the US and Spanish tend to be very mixed culturally.

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:08.509
And so I got to be with brothers

00:22:08.509 --> 00:22:11.430
from many different cultures that I had an experience before.

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:13.509
I even had to learn to speak Spanish in a way

00:22:13.509 --> 00:22:15.549
that everybody would understand instead

00:22:15.549 --> 00:22:17.509
of just the brothers from Puerto Rico.

00:22:17.509 --> 00:22:19.470
So that's a huge change for you.

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:21.470
Change of culture coming to the United States.

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:23.910
And then as you say, all these other cultures,

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:25.869
you brought along a really nice picture, Josh.

00:22:25.869 --> 00:22:27.589
What can you tell us about this?

00:22:27.589 --> 00:22:30.190
I learned this day, a very important skill,

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:32.109
which is to check the weather report

00:22:32.109 --> 00:22:33.750
before you leave home to preach.

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:34.869
Right.

00:22:34.869 --> 00:22:36.750
Do you not check the weather in Puerto Rico?

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:37.589
Nope.

00:22:37.589 --> 00:22:39.470
It's either going to be sunny or it's going to rain.

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:40.309
Two choices.

00:22:40.309 --> 00:22:41.109
Interesting.

00:22:41.109 --> 00:22:42.069
What about you, Solidey?

00:22:42.109 --> 00:22:46.269
So Josh has come to the United States.

00:22:46.269 --> 00:22:47.950
How did that affect you?

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:50.069
Well, I was happy for the assignment.

00:22:50.069 --> 00:22:51.829
It was a privilege.

00:22:51.829 --> 00:22:54.069
So I wanted to support him.

00:22:54.069 --> 00:22:55.950
So we kept in touch.

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:59.029
And in 2010, we got married.

00:22:59.029 --> 00:23:01.990
And after that, we received an invitation

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:04.630
to continue as a couple in Ohio.

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:06.150
Well, that's a big change for you then.

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:09.869
Again, just like Josh, you come new country in a sense,

00:23:10.869 --> 00:23:14.990
new marriage, new assignment and circuit work.

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:16.670
What were some of the hard moments for you?

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:18.750
Maybe Josh, you could share first.

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:21.750
Well, as I said, there was a lot of adaptation.

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:23.630
When you started a new assignment,

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:27.269
I don't think we ever felt really qualified for it,

00:23:27.269 --> 00:23:29.029
or prepared for it.

00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:31.750
And so we were very young when we started the circuit work,

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:33.910
visiting congregations where sometimes there were brothers

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:36.710
that had been serving as regular pioneers longer

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:38.230
than we'd been alive.

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:39.190
And then all of a sudden, we've

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:42.509
kind of the responsibility to encourage them and help them.

00:23:42.509 --> 00:23:45.230
So that could be a bit intimidating.

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:46.029
Sure.

00:23:46.029 --> 00:23:47.789
And you brought along another photo.

00:23:47.789 --> 00:23:50.589
You can see the confusion of the adaptation.

00:23:50.589 --> 00:23:52.470
What can you tell us about this, Josh?

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:55.670
So this was a field service day.

00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:57.549
We shortly after getting married.

00:23:57.549 --> 00:23:59.190
It wasn't that I was distracted or anything,

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:02.509
but we rushed out the door, went to field service,

00:24:02.509 --> 00:24:04.549
took the group out, made all the arrangements.

00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:06.950
And then a dear brother, very good friendy,

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:10.069
came up to me and he put his arm around my shoulder.

00:24:10.069 --> 00:24:11.750
And he took me over to Solidey.

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:13.910
And he says, I'm not going to say anything.

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:14.950
I'm just going to look.

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:16.789
And he looked down at my shoes.

00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:21.190
And well, it just turned out that I put two different shoes on.

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:22.750
And he was kind enough to point that out

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:23.750
before I went out and service.

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:26.430
But he didn't point it out before he took the picture.

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:27.750
Of course.

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:29.109
Solidey, what were you thinking?

00:24:29.109 --> 00:24:31.670
I was like, baby, what happened?

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:34.309
What are you doing?

00:24:34.309 --> 00:24:36.269
So you always check his shoes before he goes out.

00:24:36.269 --> 00:24:39.910
I learned to check him before leaving home.

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:42.869
But maybe in all seriousness, Josh, what would you say?

00:24:42.869 --> 00:24:46.430
What were the keys to helping you?

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:48.910
I got some really good advice from brothers

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:51.269
with more experience, including my father.

00:24:51.269 --> 00:24:54.589
And there's really two keys we found.

00:24:54.589 --> 00:24:56.829
One is to love the brothers.

00:24:56.829 --> 00:24:58.670
Because that's really what they need.

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:02.029
They need love and affection in your time.

00:25:02.029 --> 00:25:04.390
And the other is to be humble.

00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:06.269
Because the brothers appreciate greatly

00:25:06.269 --> 00:25:08.190
the arrangement of the circuit over here.

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:10.069
Whoever the circuit over here is.

00:25:10.069 --> 00:25:12.269
So as long as you remain humble, Jehovah

00:25:12.269 --> 00:25:14.670
can use you to encourage the friends.

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:16.190
And then all glory goes to you.

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:18.630
Very nice to love humility.

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:21.670
And that's really what helps us become all things to all people.

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:23.029
What about for you, Solidey?

00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:25.990
What were challenges for you?

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:29.470
Well, for me, it was the emotional part.

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:30.509
Because it is true.

00:25:30.509 --> 00:25:34.470
It is a beautiful privilege to be able to know

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:38.509
so many brothers and sisters and make bonds with them.

00:25:38.509 --> 00:25:41.190
But at the same time, you face reality.

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:44.029
You see all the struggle that they are going through.

00:25:44.029 --> 00:25:47.390
So some are dealing with health problems

00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:51.269
or economic problems or even their status in the country.

00:25:51.269 --> 00:25:54.990
So I was not able to help them in the way that I wanted.

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:56.589
So I felt helpless.

00:25:56.589 --> 00:25:59.269
So what could you do for them?

00:25:59.269 --> 00:26:04.190
So I had to leave that part in the Jehovah hands

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:06.910
and give them my time.

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:09.990
So I tried to go with them on service,

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:12.670
try to encourage them.

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:15.549
Sometimes we laugh, sometimes we cry.

00:26:15.549 --> 00:26:17.950
But I tried to show them our love

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:20.309
and even more important that Jehovah loved them.

00:26:20.309 --> 00:26:20.990
Nice.

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:23.309
Well, I'm sure you left a little bit of your heart

00:26:23.309 --> 00:26:24.470
with all of them.

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:26.430
That's very nice.

00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:27.789
Now you're here in Gilead.

00:26:27.789 --> 00:26:29.150
Was that a surprise for you?

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:31.589
Yes, a big surprise.

00:26:31.589 --> 00:26:33.950
And Josh, I know Gilead actually has a special place

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:34.710
in your heart.

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:35.990
Why is that?

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.509
It does.

00:26:36.509 --> 00:26:39.430
It's because my parents attended Gilead.

00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:42.029
And that's actually what brought them to Puerto Rico.

00:26:42.029 --> 00:26:44.390
They attended the 52nd class.

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:44.910
Right.

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:45.750
Good.

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:48.230
So having parents who went to Gilead,

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:49.789
did they keep Gilead in their heart even

00:26:49.789 --> 00:26:52.109
after they had a family and were raising you and your?

00:26:52.109 --> 00:26:52.910
They did.

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:53.589
Absolutely.

00:26:53.589 --> 00:26:58.390
I remember they had their graduation photo up in the hallway

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:00.950
where all of us would walk by every day.

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:03.710
So every day of my life growing up, I walked past that photo.

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:05.390
There it is, 52nd class.

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:06.470
That's them.

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:11.349
And also the way they were, the way they served Jehovah,

00:27:11.349 --> 00:27:13.910
the love and zeal that they have,

00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:17.069
it's clear to me, even clearer now,

00:27:17.069 --> 00:27:19.789
that Gilead had a big impact on them.

00:27:19.789 --> 00:27:21.309
What would you say that impact was on them?

00:27:21.309 --> 00:27:24.710
How did you see Gilead training in them?

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:26.029
I think two things.

00:27:26.029 --> 00:27:28.950
One is that there are excellent students of the Bible.

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:30.349
Always have been.

00:27:30.349 --> 00:27:32.150
My mom's Bible is so many notes I don't think

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:33.589
he can hold anymore.

00:27:33.589 --> 00:27:37.710
And my dad, I remember he would be reading the Bible

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:40.430
with us at night and he had an envelope

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:42.309
that he'd marked the family Bible with.

00:27:42.309 --> 00:27:43.670
And all of a sudden he'd stop reading

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:45.549
and stop to make a note on the envelope

00:27:45.549 --> 00:27:47.230
because he came across a scripture

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:49.950
that he wanted to use for a talk or a shepherding chord,

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:51.589
just a point that he liked.

00:27:51.589 --> 00:27:53.670
So that was an excellent example.

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:56.109
And also they've always worked very, very hard

00:27:56.109 --> 00:27:57.390
for Kingdom interests.

00:27:57.390 --> 00:27:59.589
They've always had the goal to do as much as they can

00:27:59.589 --> 00:28:01.269
for as long as they can

00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:04.029
and just kind of became the family model.

00:28:04.029 --> 00:28:06.710
So it's interesting now going through Gilead

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:08.910
and seeing so much emphasis placed on those,

00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:11.869
exactly those things to feed your love for Jehovah

00:28:11.869 --> 00:28:14.349
and do as much as you can for the organization.

00:28:14.349 --> 00:28:16.910
Yeah, I was going to ask you that as well.

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:18.309
Here you are sitting in class

00:28:18.309 --> 00:28:21.470
and you're hearing to a great degree,

00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:23.390
the same things your parents heard.

00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:24.990
Has that helped to at all?

00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:25.990
It has.

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:28.630
They must have had those qualities to an extent

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:30.109
when they came to Gilead.

00:28:30.109 --> 00:28:32.390
But I think listening to the classes now

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:36.349
it's clear that Gilead stirred that up in them

00:28:36.349 --> 00:28:38.670
and kept that flame burning for many, many years.

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:39.829
That's beautiful.

00:28:39.829 --> 00:28:41.950
And they must be very proud of both of you

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:45.390
as you apply yourselves and will apply the training

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:48.309
and look forward to applying in your future assignments.

00:28:48.309 --> 00:28:50.589
Thank you both very much for being with us today.

00:28:50.589 --> 00:28:52.150
Thank you.

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:54.990
In the introduction, we quoted Paul's words

00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:57.509
in 1 Corinthians 9 verse 22.

00:28:57.509 --> 00:29:01.589
He said, I've become all things to people of all sorts

00:29:01.589 --> 00:29:05.630
so that I might by all possible means save some.

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:09.509
The apostle obligated himself to adjust his life

00:29:09.509 --> 00:29:12.710
and personal tastes for the sake of the good news.

00:29:13.789 --> 00:29:16.990
We hope today's program has been encouraging to you

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:20.309
whether it's trying something you just don't prefer

00:29:20.309 --> 00:29:22.190
or something you didn't think you could do

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:24.109
in Jehovah's service.

00:29:24.109 --> 00:29:27.230
Maybe it's just getting in the game so to speak

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:29.789
or giving someone a little piece of your heart

00:29:29.789 --> 00:29:31.509
to encourage them.

00:29:31.509 --> 00:29:36.309
Today's guests have shown us that by adjusting your life

00:29:36.309 --> 00:29:39.390
and personal tastes for the sake of the good news

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:43.109
with Jehovah, we can cope with any change

00:29:43.109 --> 00:29:46.950
or make any change for Jehovah's service.

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:48.269
Thank you for being with us

00:29:48.269 --> 00:29:49.509
and we look forward to seeing you

00:29:49.509 --> 00:29:51.990
on another edition of the Inside Story.

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:22.200
Very encouraging and nice to see a picture

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:27.039
of that 52nd class I mentioned in the introduction

00:30:27.039 --> 00:30:30.440
and Josh wasn't there, you know, he was.

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.279
He was.

00:30:31.279 --> 00:30:32.119
He was.

00:30:33.079 --> 00:30:36.000
They were rewarded with him later,

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.200
there in Puerto Rico.

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.400
So that was so encouraging.

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:43.119
We really appreciate the inside story.

00:30:43.119 --> 00:30:46.880
We thank Trent and all those participants.

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:50.160
And now we look forward to another member

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:53.119
of the governing body for the Jeff Jackson's

00:30:53.119 --> 00:30:56.079
going to speak on the subject.

00:30:56.079 --> 00:30:57.119
And this is for you.

00:30:57.119 --> 00:31:02.119
Students particularly now share what you have learned.

00:31:04.539 --> 00:31:09.539
The graduation of the 150th class of Gilead.

00:31:09.779 --> 00:31:14.779
Who would have thought that we would have 150 classes

00:31:14.779 --> 00:31:16.900
of Gilead and probably for you students,

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:18.859
you were wondering if you would survive

00:31:18.859 --> 00:31:21.779
to the 150th graduation.

00:31:22.779 --> 00:31:26.380
Over the years, graduations of Gilead

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:28.900
have taken various forms.

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:30.900
If you look at this photograph,

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:34.660
you'll notice that the seventh class,

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:37.740
the graduation was in 1946.

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:38.940
And what do you notice?

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:41.380
The guests who came along,

00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:45.420
they were in the open air, hoping for good weather.

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:47.460
And I'm told there was no,

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:49.019
it wasn't a ticketed event,

00:31:49.019 --> 00:31:52.460
so just those that wanted to come along came along.

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:54.019
And then notice in the next one here,

00:31:54.019 --> 00:31:58.059
we've got the president giving one of the talks

00:31:58.059 --> 00:32:01.059
on the stairs leading up to Gilead.

00:32:01.059 --> 00:32:03.140
Well, things have changed.

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:06.660
In 1953, the 21st class,

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:10.700
graduated at the Yankee Stadium.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:13.460
And you'd imagine that was a huge event.

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:17.420
And in fact, it commemorated the 10th anniversary of Gilead.

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:19.220
And it was very appropriate because

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:22.819
that was a very special year, 1953.

00:32:22.819 --> 00:32:25.339
That was the year that the US government

00:32:25.339 --> 00:32:29.059
granted us legal status so that we could have foreign students

00:32:29.059 --> 00:32:31.579
come and join the school.

00:32:31.579 --> 00:32:35.059
And then of course, no matter what graduation we've had,

00:32:35.059 --> 00:32:38.779
always the joyous look on the faces of those graduating.

00:32:38.779 --> 00:32:41.660
That's the common denominator.

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:42.859
Of course, in recent years,

00:32:42.859 --> 00:32:45.099
we've had some very different graduations

00:32:45.099 --> 00:32:49.220
as well, haven't we, with no live audience?

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:58.809
But aren't you happy that we've got a live audience today?

00:32:58.809 --> 00:33:00.690
Now after the last few months,

00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:04.369
you've been so through so many lessons

00:33:04.369 --> 00:33:07.289
and written exams and so on,

00:33:07.289 --> 00:33:09.490
there's been a lot of training.

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:12.490
And what has been the purpose of all of that?

00:33:12.529 --> 00:33:17.130
But when we think of worldly institutions and education,

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:20.609
usually it's all about the students, isn't it?

00:33:20.609 --> 00:33:24.809
It's all about their dreams, as Brother Morris mentioned.

00:33:24.809 --> 00:33:26.930
It's all about their ambitions

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:30.690
and their success that they're looking forward to.

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:31.890
But what about Gilead?

00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:34.529
Well, you've learned very clearly,

00:33:34.529 --> 00:33:36.930
I'm sure that it's not about you.

00:33:38.049 --> 00:33:38.769
And if you haven't,

00:33:38.769 --> 00:33:41.569
maybe we need to enroll you in the next class as well.

00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:46.529
No, as dedicated servants of Jehovah,

00:33:46.529 --> 00:33:49.170
we see that it's nothing is about us.

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:51.009
It's not all about us.

00:33:51.009 --> 00:33:53.609
It's about what we can accomplish

00:33:53.609 --> 00:33:57.049
in praising our Heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:33:57.049 --> 00:33:59.009
So now you're at this point

00:33:59.009 --> 00:34:01.930
where you're about to graduate.

00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:02.769
Now what?

00:34:03.849 --> 00:34:08.530
Now's the time for you to share what you've learned with others.

00:34:09.369 --> 00:34:10.570
Now what does that involve?

00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:13.409
Does this mean you're going to go to different assignments

00:34:13.409 --> 00:34:16.210
and start up little Gilead glasses,

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:19.530
informally, in the back rooms of Kingdom Halls?

00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:21.929
I wouldn't advise that.

00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:29.130
So what does it mean to share what you've learned with others?

00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:33.369
Well, as has already been highlighted in this program,

00:34:33.369 --> 00:34:37.969
your example working hard is going to help others

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:41.730
to see in action what you learned at Gilead.

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:45.530
But also, we see a very interesting scripture

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:47.170
in the second book of Timothy.

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:51.289
So please turn with me to second Timothy chapter two

00:34:51.289 --> 00:34:52.929
and verse two.

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:55.969
And here Paul is speaking to Timothy,

00:34:55.969 --> 00:35:00.090
but he captures the thought of what else we need to do.

00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:03.210
In verse two, it says the things you heard from me

00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:05.690
that were supported by many witnesses,

00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:09.050
these things in trust of faithful men

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:14.050
who in turn will be adequately qualified to teach others.

00:35:15.409 --> 00:35:19.050
What do we see from this particular verse?

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:22.730
Well, yes, you will teach by your example, doing hard work,

00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:26.530
but also you need to take interest in others

00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:29.449
and perhaps in a more informal setting,

00:35:29.449 --> 00:35:32.250
help them to see the principles and the lessons

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:35.610
that you've learned from your Gilead training.

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:37.769
And that's a very important thing.

00:35:38.849 --> 00:35:42.210
We could take the example of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:44.969
Of course, Jesus was, His main focus

00:35:44.969 --> 00:35:48.289
was the preaching of the good news of the kingdom, wasn't it?

00:35:48.289 --> 00:35:50.289
But that's not all he did.

00:35:50.289 --> 00:35:53.690
If we turn to Mark chapter nine,

00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:58.690
notice in Jesus' busy schedule, what he made time for.

00:35:59.449 --> 00:36:03.530
This is Mark chapter nine, verses 30 and 31.

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:08.210
They departed from there and went through Galilee,

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:11.969
but he did not want anyone to get to know about it.

00:36:11.969 --> 00:36:15.650
So this was something where he wanted some peace and quiet.

00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:16.969
Why?

00:36:16.969 --> 00:36:19.050
Well, verse 31 says,

00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:23.289
for he was teaching his disciples.

00:36:23.289 --> 00:36:26.730
So Jesus took time from his busy schedule

00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:30.369
to show interest in those who he was training

00:36:30.369 --> 00:36:33.369
to help them to be prepared for the future.

00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:36.809
So that's a wonderful example for us.

00:36:36.809 --> 00:36:38.170
When we look through the scriptures,

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:41.170
we see many examples, but for the next few minutes,

00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:43.769
we're going to think about Barnabas.

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:49.690
And how Barnabas was able to share what he learned with Paul.

00:36:50.650 --> 00:36:52.889
And as we think about what happened

00:36:52.889 --> 00:36:56.449
in that interaction between Barnabas and Paul,

00:36:56.449 --> 00:36:59.409
we're going to learn five lessons.

00:36:59.409 --> 00:37:03.369
Five lessons that teach us how to handle training

00:37:03.369 --> 00:37:05.690
others and passing on what we've learned.

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:08.690
So the first lesson, if you turn with me,

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:12.530
please, through the book of Acts, Acts chapter nine.

00:37:13.489 --> 00:37:17.610
This takes us to the year around the year 36C.

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:22.610
So Saul has already become a Christian now after a while

00:37:22.769 --> 00:37:24.409
he arrives in Jerusalem.

00:37:24.409 --> 00:37:26.210
So what happens?

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:28.769
In verse 26 of chapter nine, it says,

00:37:28.769 --> 00:37:32.250
on arriving in Jerusalem, he, that's Paul,

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:35.289
made efforts to join the disciples.

00:37:35.289 --> 00:37:37.050
But they were all afraid of him.

00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:38.050
I wonder why?

00:37:39.369 --> 00:37:42.449
Because they did not believe he was a disciple.

00:37:42.449 --> 00:37:46.369
They were thinking this is going to be a very dangerous thing.

00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:50.329
But now what happened in verse 27?

00:37:50.329 --> 00:37:55.329
So Barnabas came to his aid and led him to the apostles.

00:37:56.570 --> 00:37:59.650
So we see as pictured here,

00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:04.690
Barnabas saw the potential in Saul

00:38:04.690 --> 00:38:07.690
and believed that really he could be useful

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:09.050
in Jehovah's service.

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:12.250
So he risked his reputation, you might say,

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:15.329
by supporting or sponsoring Saul

00:38:15.329 --> 00:38:18.050
and taking him to the apostles.

00:38:18.969 --> 00:38:22.409
So what's the lesson that we learn from this?

00:38:22.409 --> 00:38:26.250
Try to see the potential in others.

00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:30.730
And don't worry about if you perhaps encourage them

00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:34.090
and you give them support, you sponsor them, you might say,

00:38:34.090 --> 00:38:36.210
and then they don't really turn out well

00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:38.250
that now all of a sudden your reputation

00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:40.010
is going to be tarnished.

00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:42.570
Remember, it's not all about you.

00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:45.329
It's what is good for the work.

00:38:45.329 --> 00:38:46.769
So that's the first lesson.

00:38:46.769 --> 00:38:50.289
Try to see the potential in others.

00:38:50.329 --> 00:38:53.210
Now if we turn across to Acts chapter 11,

00:38:54.369 --> 00:38:59.369
this goes about nine years later, around the year 45 CE.

00:39:00.369 --> 00:39:03.409
Now in chapter 11 of Acts,

00:39:03.409 --> 00:39:06.690
the work is going ahead in the Gentile field

00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:10.090
and particularly in the city of Antioch.

00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:14.050
So Barnabas was assigned by the brothers

00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:18.170
to go and help the congregation in Antioch.

00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:21.570
Well, let's look down verses 25 and 26

00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:24.050
because as soon as Barnabas arrived there,

00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:28.010
he realized he needed help.

00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:30.010
So what did he do?

00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:32.570
Well, in verse 25 it says,

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:35.610
he that's Barnabas went to Tassus

00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:38.849
to make a thorough search for Saul.

00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:42.489
So he went to find Saul.

00:39:42.489 --> 00:39:46.050
He remembered this is a man who could speak Greek

00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:48.409
and was well educated.

00:39:48.409 --> 00:39:51.769
He'd be able to help him with the Gentile field.

00:39:51.769 --> 00:39:54.449
It's interesting that when you look at a map,

00:39:54.449 --> 00:39:59.449
you'll notice that it's about 120 miles from Antioch to Tassus

00:40:00.969 --> 00:40:03.050
or about 200 kilometers.

00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:05.650
It mentions here in verse 25,

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:07.409
he made a thorough search for Saul.

00:40:07.409 --> 00:40:08.409
Why?

00:40:08.409 --> 00:40:10.730
Well, if we compare first Corinthians

00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:14.530
where Paul lists all the things he did, many of those,

00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:18.289
it appears happened in those nine years.

00:40:18.289 --> 00:40:20.090
He was shipwrecked several times,

00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:21.610
put it into prison and so on.

00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:23.769
So he was very busy.

00:40:23.769 --> 00:40:25.849
Barnabas sought him out.

00:40:25.849 --> 00:40:27.130
And then what did he have to do?

00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:30.969
Well, in verse 26 it says after he found him,

00:40:30.969 --> 00:40:33.489
he brought him to Antioch.

00:40:33.489 --> 00:40:34.690
So what did he have to do?

00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:37.369
He had to convince Saul.

00:40:37.369 --> 00:40:39.530
You could imagine that might have been a little difficult

00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:42.690
because Saul was having productive ministry.

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:44.969
So he brought him to Antioch.

00:40:44.969 --> 00:40:46.809
Then verse 26 says,

00:40:46.809 --> 00:40:50.769
for a whole year they assembled with them in the congregation

00:40:50.769 --> 00:40:53.449
and taught quite a crowd.

00:40:53.449 --> 00:40:56.449
So Barnabas didn't take Paul and say,

00:40:56.449 --> 00:40:58.090
now I'm going to teach you.

00:40:58.090 --> 00:41:00.849
He just had him work along with him.

00:41:00.849 --> 00:41:02.650
And as they work together,

00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:05.170
that would have given Saul some training.

00:41:06.369 --> 00:41:09.610
So what's the lesson that we learned?

00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:11.409
Be willing to make the effort.

00:41:11.409 --> 00:41:15.130
You see, Barnabas not only saw the potential,

00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:18.170
but he was willing to go and find Saul,

00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:20.489
then convince him to come and work with him.

00:41:20.489 --> 00:41:22.369
And then they worked together.

00:41:22.369 --> 00:41:24.489
So that's the second lesson.

00:41:24.489 --> 00:41:27.769
The third lesson is in Acts 13.

00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:33.730
So after Barnabas and Saul were in Antioch for some time,

00:41:33.730 --> 00:41:36.650
what happened in verse two?

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:38.889
It says as they were ministering to Jehovah

00:41:38.889 --> 00:41:42.329
and fasting, the Holy Spirit said,

00:41:42.329 --> 00:41:45.849
set aside for me Barnabas and Saul

00:41:45.849 --> 00:41:48.010
for the work to which I have called them.

00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:51.570
Well now this is the time when they're going out

00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:53.449
in their missionary field.

00:41:54.409 --> 00:41:58.769
But notice the Holy Spirit mentions Barnabas and Saul.

00:41:58.769 --> 00:42:01.849
So in this illustration we see who's taking the lead.

00:42:01.849 --> 00:42:05.449
Barnabas, Saul's following along.

00:42:05.449 --> 00:42:07.969
But if we look down further in verse 13

00:42:07.969 --> 00:42:12.050
of the same chapter, we see there's a little change.

00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:15.889
Saul starts to use a name that is more common in that area.

00:42:15.889 --> 00:42:17.929
Paul, but what does it say?

00:42:17.929 --> 00:42:21.730
Now Paul and his companions would have to see.

00:42:21.730 --> 00:42:26.010
And from here on, it seems that Paul took the lead.

00:42:27.369 --> 00:42:29.690
Now let's just imagine for a little bit

00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:31.130
that you were Barnabas.

00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:33.530
Maybe we could imagine ourselves saying

00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:35.690
quietly to Saul or Paul,

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:37.929
whatever he was calling himself at that time.

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:41.050
Can I just have a few words with you?

00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:45.409
This is not a big issue, but remember when Holy Spirit

00:42:45.409 --> 00:42:49.650
said we were going out, it was Barnabas and Saul.

00:42:51.369 --> 00:42:53.409
Now I don't have a big problem with this,

00:42:53.409 --> 00:42:56.730
but I appreciate your enthusiasm,

00:42:56.730 --> 00:43:01.010
but really I was the one designed to take the lead here.

00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:02.849
Now he didn't say that, did he?

00:43:02.849 --> 00:43:07.849
The Bethara Witness spoke mentions he wasn't envious at all.

00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:09.650
So what's the lesson?

00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:13.369
Well, if we're working along with someone

00:43:13.369 --> 00:43:18.690
and training them, the lesson is don't be envious

00:43:18.929 --> 00:43:21.210
if they start to excel.

00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:23.449
And actually what we're hoping them to do

00:43:23.449 --> 00:43:26.690
is to blossom and they get some of the privileges

00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:29.570
that perhaps we would have liked along the way.

00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:33.130
So we won't be saying, well, excuse me,

00:43:33.130 --> 00:43:35.929
but I'm the one who went through Gilead.

00:43:35.929 --> 00:43:38.489
No, we won't be envious.

00:43:39.409 --> 00:43:43.489
The fourth lesson takes us to the book of Galatians.

00:43:43.489 --> 00:43:47.849
So if you turn with me to Galatians, chapter two.

00:43:47.849 --> 00:43:50.889
And this is around the year 49 CE.

00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:56.530
Already Peter and Paul and Barnabas and Titus

00:43:56.530 --> 00:43:58.409
had all been to Jerusalem

00:43:58.409 --> 00:44:00.289
and they had had the big discussion

00:44:00.289 --> 00:44:03.610
with the governing body about circumcision.

00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:06.369
Interestingly, when they arrived in Jerusalem,

00:44:06.369 --> 00:44:09.650
the account says, Barnabas and Paul were there.

00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:12.929
Interesting, maybe Barnabas took note of that

00:44:12.929 --> 00:44:14.889
that he was mentioned first again,

00:44:14.889 --> 00:44:17.130
probably because the governing body remembered

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:20.650
that was actually the role originally.

00:44:20.650 --> 00:44:24.530
But now we find that Peter, Paul, and Barnabas

00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:27.250
and some others were back in Antioch.

00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:31.489
And what happened just a few months after that special meeting?

00:44:31.489 --> 00:44:36.489
Well, Paul had to tell Peter he was doing something wrong.

00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:39.329
But notice, please, what verse 13 says,

00:44:40.769 --> 00:44:42.929
the rest of the Jews also joined him

00:44:42.929 --> 00:44:45.010
in putting on this pretense.

00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:49.570
So that even Barnabas was let along with them in their pretense.

00:44:49.570 --> 00:44:51.409
Now, I just love this picture.

00:44:51.409 --> 00:44:54.929
You see, Paul telling Peter he's wrong.

00:44:54.929 --> 00:44:56.730
And you look, have a look at that.

00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:59.449
Look on Barnabas face it.

00:44:59.449 --> 00:45:01.289
He looks guilty.

00:45:01.289 --> 00:45:03.170
Awkward.

00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:07.730
You see, he was caught in the crossfire.

00:45:08.769 --> 00:45:10.929
He likewise was getting counsel

00:45:10.929 --> 00:45:13.489
because he was involved with this.

00:45:13.489 --> 00:45:17.289
So what lesson do we gain from this?

00:45:17.289 --> 00:45:21.090
Except counsel, even from those who we are viewing

00:45:21.130 --> 00:45:23.690
as the ones who were training?

00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:26.969
Don't feel that we're above accepting counsel.

00:45:28.289 --> 00:45:31.050
Now, the final lesson is the one probably

00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:32.570
you thought about immediately

00:45:32.570 --> 00:45:34.369
when we mentioned Paul and Barnabas.

00:45:34.369 --> 00:45:36.769
I know what you were thinking, Acts 15.

00:45:36.769 --> 00:45:38.489
So let's turn there.

00:45:38.489 --> 00:45:43.489
Acts 15 and verses 37 to 39.

00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:49.480
And this is after the incident in Antioch.

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:52.199
And it says, Barnabas was determined

00:45:52.199 --> 00:45:56.079
to take along John who was called Mark.

00:45:56.079 --> 00:46:00.360
Paul, however, was not in favor of taking him along with them,

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:03.360
seeing that he had departed from them in Pamphilia

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:06.280
and had not gone with them to the work.

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:10.280
At this, there was a sharp burst of anger

00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:12.599
so that they separated from each other.

00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:16.480
Now, this is the instance that we usually remember

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:18.960
when we think of Paul and Barnabas.

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:21.719
What led to this problem?

00:46:21.719 --> 00:46:24.039
Have you ever thought about that?

00:46:24.039 --> 00:46:26.719
It mentions that Paul was very hesitant

00:46:26.719 --> 00:46:29.960
about taking John Mark along with them.

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:33.559
Perhaps he remembered on that first missionary tour

00:46:33.559 --> 00:46:35.519
when John Mark had gone back,

00:46:35.519 --> 00:46:39.079
he and Barnabas continued on into Galatia

00:46:39.079 --> 00:46:41.519
and reading what Paul said to the Galatians.

00:46:41.519 --> 00:46:45.599
It seems obvious that Paul had problems with his eyes

00:46:45.599 --> 00:46:48.360
and he was very sick at that point.

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:52.000
So no doubt, you know, he missed having a young man

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.079
available to carry the luggage

00:46:54.079 --> 00:46:57.000
to do all the things that needed to be done.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:02.000
So part of us can understand why Paul was hesitant.

00:47:02.159 --> 00:47:04.920
He didn't want to lose the hope again.

00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:06.960
But then on the other hand, what about Barnabas?

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:11.519
Why do you think he was so determined to take John Mark?

00:47:11.519 --> 00:47:14.760
Well, it could be the fact that he was a relative

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:17.719
that sometimes comes into a factor

00:47:17.719 --> 00:47:21.760
or it could be that the fact that Barnabas saw

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:26.280
the potential in Saul is the same thing he saw in John Mark.

00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:28.239
This is a good young man.

00:47:28.239 --> 00:47:30.039
We need to give him a chance.

00:47:31.199 --> 00:47:34.199
Or could it be that he was still stinging

00:47:34.199 --> 00:47:37.280
a little bit after the rebuke in Antioch?

00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:43.280
Or could it be that he was still viewing Saul or Paul

00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:47.320
as a student, someone you're in the truth in him

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:52.320
and someone that he just found it hard to accept his opinion?

00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:56.320
Now, we're not going to play the blame game.

00:47:56.320 --> 00:48:00.320
Some of us will be working with these brothers later.

00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:10.110
But I feel safe in saying this.

00:48:10.110 --> 00:48:13.110
I'm sure that Paul and Barnabas,

00:48:13.110 --> 00:48:16.110
when they think back to that day,

00:48:16.110 --> 00:48:19.030
would agree they could have done things better.

00:48:19.309 --> 00:48:20.710
Is that a safe comment?

00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:23.949
I think all of us have things we've felt.

00:48:23.949 --> 00:48:27.869
Maybe we were right, but we could have handled it better.

00:48:27.869 --> 00:48:29.110
So what's the lesson?

00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:32.829
Try to respect different opinions.

00:48:32.829 --> 00:48:35.230
Don't overreact.

00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:36.670
Don't get upset.

00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:39.869
Try to work through things so that it doesn't affect

00:48:39.869 --> 00:48:41.550
our working relationship.

00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:46.469
Well, when we've thought about Barnabas and Paul,

00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:49.309
it really gives us a lot of food for thought, doesn't it?

00:48:49.309 --> 00:48:51.469
Remember those five lessons?

00:48:51.469 --> 00:48:54.829
Try to see the potential in others.

00:48:54.829 --> 00:48:58.070
Then be willing to put for the effort

00:48:58.070 --> 00:49:00.230
that's required to train them.

00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:03.349
Don't be envious if they get privileges,

00:49:03.349 --> 00:49:05.909
except counsel if they offer you counsel

00:49:05.909 --> 00:49:08.989
and respect their opinions as well.

00:49:08.989 --> 00:49:13.510
We know that you'll try to implement those suggestions.

00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:17.030
Yes, as you go to your assignments,

00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:20.190
may your hover be with you and bless you,

00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:23.869
may you try to help others by sharing what you've learned

00:49:23.869 --> 00:49:26.070
at Gilead, and in that way,

00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:29.230
you will fulfill the purpose of Gilead

00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:42.420
to stabilize and strengthen others.

00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:45.420
So you heard them nice and clear?

00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:47.420
Share what you've learned.

00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:51.900
Beautiful lessons, keep in mind.

00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:56.820
Now, the students have certainly looked forward

00:49:56.820 --> 00:50:00.699
to this point for over five months,

00:50:01.699 --> 00:50:05.980
and they're going to transition into Gilead graduates.

00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:08.659
So this is what this,

00:50:08.659 --> 00:50:11.099
now, Brother Ken Flodin,

00:50:11.099 --> 00:50:13.260
the helper to the teaching committee,

00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:16.460
is going to assist by introducing the graduates

00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:19.739
and then letting us know where they're assigned.

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:23.099
We'll hand out the diplomas.

00:50:23.099 --> 00:50:26.260
First, we have a brother and sister baker,

00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:28.900
and they're going to be serving in Angola.

00:50:31.059 --> 00:50:32.539
Maybe sister, thank you.

00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:42.539
This is brother and sister, Barber.

00:50:42.539 --> 00:50:44.820
They'll be remaining in the United States

00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:47.619
where Ryan will serve as a member of the branch committee.

00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:58.869
Brother and sister, Bill,

00:50:58.869 --> 00:51:00.829
will also be remaining in the United States

00:51:00.829 --> 00:51:04.909
where Steve will be serving as a member of the branch committee.

00:51:04.909 --> 00:51:14.679
Congratulations.

00:51:14.679 --> 00:51:16.599
Brother and sister, Boring Sign,

00:51:16.599 --> 00:51:20.239
will be transferred to Angola,

00:51:20.239 --> 00:51:23.400
where Taylor will be serving on the branch committee there.

00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:34.409
Okay, congratulations.

00:51:34.409 --> 00:51:35.690
And here we have Brother and sister,

00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:39.530
Ryan, they're being transferred to the Philippines,

00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:44.530
and Ben will be serving on the branch committee there.

00:51:44.530 --> 00:51:45.969
Congratulations.

00:51:45.969 --> 00:51:55.349
Congratulations.

00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:57.070
And this is brother Hess.

00:51:57.070 --> 00:51:59.269
He's going to be serving in the United States.

00:51:59.269 --> 00:52:00.550
Very good.

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:08.659
Congratulations.

00:52:08.659 --> 00:52:12.179
Brother and sister Lopez will be remaining in the United States.

00:52:12.179 --> 00:52:21.500
Oh, right. Congratulations.

00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:22.980
This is brother and sister Monty,

00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:25.219
and they will be remaining in the United States.

00:52:25.219 --> 00:52:34.760
All right.

00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:36.559
Brother and sister Martinez,

00:52:36.559 --> 00:52:39.079
they're going to now be serving in Paraguay

00:52:39.079 --> 00:52:41.599
where he will be serving as a member of the branch committee.

00:52:41.599 --> 00:52:48.809
Okay.

00:52:48.849 --> 00:52:50.250
Uh-oh.

00:52:50.250 --> 00:52:58.139
And this is Brother and sister Morris,

00:52:58.139 --> 00:53:00.780
and they will be remaining in the United States

00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:04.179
where he will be serving as a member of the branch committee.

00:53:04.179 --> 00:53:06.420
Congratulations, man.

00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:10.420
Awesome.

00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:25.190
That was great.

00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:28.630
It'll be hard to follow that one up.

00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:29.909
This is brother Morrison,

00:53:29.909 --> 00:53:32.670
and he'll be remaining in the United States.

00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:42.489
Good job, man.

00:53:42.489 --> 00:53:44.690
And this is brother and sister Parmaly.

00:53:44.730 --> 00:53:47.010
They're going to now be serving in the Philippines

00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:49.010
where he's going to serve on the branch committee.

00:53:49.010 --> 00:54:00.539
Very good.

00:54:00.539 --> 00:54:02.579
And finally, this is brother and sister Rich and that

00:54:02.579 --> 00:54:04.860
can they're going to serve in Paraguay

00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:20.519
where he'll be serving on the branch committee.

00:54:20.519 --> 00:54:21.719
Well, that went quick.

00:54:21.719 --> 00:54:24.719
That was, uh, it's very good.

00:54:25.719 --> 00:54:29.320
Well, very special to all of us.

00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:32.599
Bless the program, that's for sure.

00:54:32.599 --> 00:54:36.760
Just to want to share some concluding comments

00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:40.800
and, uh, I think you're supposed to raise that curtain,

00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:42.800
aren't you?

00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:44.159
Oh, you know what?

00:54:44.159 --> 00:54:45.320
Yeah, I want to see Ryan.

00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:46.639
Where's Ryan?

00:54:46.639 --> 00:54:47.639
Oh, yeah.

00:54:47.639 --> 00:54:50.880
So Ryan's going to read a letter

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:53.519
from the class force.

00:54:53.519 --> 00:54:57.800
You're listening.

00:54:57.800 --> 00:55:02.579
Yeah.

00:55:02.579 --> 00:55:04.860
To the governing body.

00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:08.539
Dear brothers, over 2,500 years ago,

00:55:08.539 --> 00:55:11.659
Jehovah addressed Jeremiah with the words,

00:55:11.739 --> 00:55:15.579
Here I am, Jehovah, that God of all mankind.

00:55:15.579 --> 00:55:20.099
Is there anything too wonderful for me?

00:55:20.099 --> 00:55:22.260
Attending Gilead at this time in our lives

00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:26.300
and in the midst of a pandemic seemed too wonderful to us.

00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:29.739
But it was not too wonderful for Jehovah.

00:55:29.739 --> 00:55:31.619
Thank you for the undeserved kindness

00:55:31.619 --> 00:55:35.860
of being invited to attend this unique school.

00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:38.260
The pinnacle of education in this world

00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:40.860
is divine education.

00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:43.019
Through it, the depth of God's wisdom

00:55:43.019 --> 00:55:45.739
has taken on new meaning for us.

00:55:45.739 --> 00:55:50.099
We feel a greater closeness to Jehovah than ever before.

00:55:50.099 --> 00:55:54.300
And we feel a closeness to our legacy from Adam

00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:57.139
to the faithful and discreet slave.

00:55:57.139 --> 00:55:59.420
At the same time, Gilead has revealed ways

00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:02.699
in which we need to continue to grow spiritually

00:56:02.699 --> 00:56:08.219
while providing the blueprint and the motivation to do so.

00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:10.260
We love our dear instructors

00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:13.059
who brought out of their treasure store

00:56:13.059 --> 00:56:15.780
things both new and old as they journeyed with us

00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:16.780
through God's word.

00:56:17.739 --> 00:56:19.940
Their example and that of their wives helped us

00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:22.340
during these five months of molding.

00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:24.460
And yet, by the way of the scriptures,

00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:27.260
by the way, the scriptures were opened up

00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:31.139
and spiritual matters were explained by spiritual words,

00:56:31.139 --> 00:56:33.420
we could feel that we were really being taught

00:56:33.539 --> 00:56:37.820
by our grand instructor, Jehovah, and our exemplar Jesus.

00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:41.420
Thank you, too, for taking precious time

00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:45.420
from your busy schedules to deliver lectures to us.

00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:48.099
Each one of you, as well of all those assigned

00:56:48.099 --> 00:56:51.099
to give lectures, delivered information to us

00:56:51.099 --> 00:56:53.420
with warmth and enthusiasm.

00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:59.300
We saw Bible truth so much simpler and more clearly.

00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:02.179
Your humility, sense of humor,

00:57:02.179 --> 00:57:05.579
and kindness showed your tender affection for us.

00:57:05.579 --> 00:57:07.900
Like Paul, you were determined to impart

00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:10.179
not only the good news of God,

00:57:10.179 --> 00:57:13.019
but also your very selves.

00:57:13.019 --> 00:57:16.780
We will never forget your love for Jehovah

00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:19.699
and the privilege we have had to learn from you in person.

00:57:21.099 --> 00:57:24.099
We also feel a deep, a debt of gratitude

00:57:24.099 --> 00:57:26.940
to the Bethel family for their living example

00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:28.940
of kindness and hospitality.

00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:33.219
Qualities we learn so much about in class.

00:57:33.219 --> 00:57:35.139
Even routine trips to the pantry

00:57:35.139 --> 00:57:37.500
or walk around the complex turned into

00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:40.900
spontaneous interchanges of encouragement.

00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:43.579
For this, we consider the Bethel family's example

00:57:43.579 --> 00:57:45.619
to be part of our education.

00:57:47.539 --> 00:57:49.420
We know what we have to do now.

00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:54.260
Apply ourselves to strengthening and stabilizing

00:57:54.260 --> 00:57:57.099
by upholding Bible truth and caring for Jehovah's

00:57:57.099 --> 00:58:01.219
precious sheep in the areas where we will serve.

00:58:01.219 --> 00:58:03.860
This is a humbling assignment,

00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:06.619
but it is one we want to carry out

00:58:06.619 --> 00:58:10.500
by imitating your example in that of the Christ.

00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:14.619
We are fully confident that Jehovah will help us

00:58:14.619 --> 00:58:19.059
because we have seen that nothing is too wonderful for him

00:58:19.059 --> 00:58:21.980
with warm love, your brothers and sisters,

00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:39.679
150th class of Gilead.

00:58:39.679 --> 00:58:43.340
Ryan didn't want to hug me.

00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:45.579
It's personal, you know.

00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:52.039
Now that's very touching sentiments

00:58:52.039 --> 00:58:57.039
and the everybody treasures those expressions from all of you.

00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:02.119
And just concluding comments for you some things to pass on

00:59:02.119 --> 00:59:06.000
that of course all of us listening can benefit.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:10.400
Mention, we talk about the SKE School

00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:12.480
for Kingdom Evangelizers

00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:14.800
and see everything changed with Gilead

00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:18.760
giving you some statistics shortly.

00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:22.480
But the School for Kingdom Evangelizers

00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:24.960
has just been so blessed by Jehovah.

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:31.079
Two months, but they just are strengthening

00:59:31.079 --> 00:59:33.199
the brothers and sisters in the field.

00:59:33.199 --> 00:59:36.199
Some of them end up in the circuit work, missionaries.

00:59:36.199 --> 00:59:39.039
So he's blessing that and what's another blessing

00:59:39.039 --> 00:59:43.079
is as we deal with this side of Armageddon

00:59:43.719 --> 00:59:45.239
is all these different languages.

00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:48.400
They don't have to learn English,

00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:50.239
which was always a struggle,

00:59:51.559 --> 00:59:54.400
that's the fault of language,

00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:57.719
certainly not those sincere individuals wanting

00:59:57.719 --> 01:00:00.199
to come to Gilead.

01:00:00.199 --> 01:00:03.920
So they've done wonderful Jehovah's bless the School.

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:06.239
Now you've had these five months

01:00:06.239 --> 01:00:09.639
and these are some statistics that reveal

01:00:09.639 --> 01:00:11.519
how Jehovah has blessed

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:15.480
the governing body's decision years ago.

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:18.400
Because Gilead's change is you see some of the history

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:22.159
and appreciate it very much for the Jackson's review

01:00:22.159 --> 01:00:24.719
of some of these pictures.

01:00:24.719 --> 01:00:27.400
But it was a missionary school obviously

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:30.840
and they did tremendous work after World War II.

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:32.679
But you may remember

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:37.960
and these are statistics starting with the class 132,

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:40.280
that's October 2011.

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:42.639
The focus of the school changed.

01:00:43.679 --> 01:00:48.119
See now, he brought in special full-time servants.

01:00:48.119 --> 01:00:49.599
See, there was a time you'd go to Gilead

01:00:49.599 --> 01:00:50.880
if you were a regular pioneer

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:53.719
and had good recommendations.

01:00:53.719 --> 01:00:57.519
But these are all special full-time servants.

01:00:57.519 --> 01:01:01.920
But what was the thinking behind the decision

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:05.000
was to stabilize and strengthen the field

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.199
and branch organization, see.

01:01:09.199 --> 01:01:11.400
And just help the brothers there

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:14.440
and the branches they'd serve in

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:18.679
to be sure to adhere to scriptural and theocratic direction.

01:01:18.679 --> 01:01:21.639
So the school has really been blessed

01:01:21.639 --> 01:01:24.679
that decision that Jehovah

01:01:24.679 --> 01:01:26.760
helped the governing body make

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:29.800
and it's his organization, this earthly part.

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:32.639
And it's just an amazing what's happened

01:01:32.639 --> 01:01:34.760
to show his, the results,

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:38.480
the wisdom through righteous by its works or results.

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:40.079
So here's some statistics.

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:44.280
There are 675 branch

01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:48.119
and 17 country committees worldwide.

01:01:48.119 --> 01:01:49.920
So that's 692.

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:55.000
Of these 692 members,

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.519
355 are Gilead graduates.

01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:03.719
So you're talking 51.3% already.

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:07.440
Since when we started that.

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:10.760
Now, of the 355 graduates,

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:13.960
221 of them, which is 62%

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:16.920
are from classes 132 to 149.

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:19.920
This is in these last 10 years.

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:25.840
So these 220, one brothers represent 46.2%

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:29.239
of the 478 total brothers

01:02:29.239 --> 01:02:34.239
who are graduates of classes 132 to 149, see.

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:37.599
What happens to, you know,

01:02:37.599 --> 01:02:40.199
we have some of you here already

01:02:40.199 --> 01:02:42.480
going to be on branch committees.

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:44.480
And that happened in past classes too,

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:47.840
but see, some of them that went to their assignments,

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:50.280
they weren't on the committee right away,

01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:53.079
but not too long after some years,

01:02:53.079 --> 01:02:54.840
they're on the committee.

01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:58.199
So Gilead made a big difference,

01:02:58.199 --> 01:03:01.519
form and it's helping the organization.

01:03:01.519 --> 01:03:03.559
They've been around headquarters,

01:03:03.559 --> 01:03:05.719
like I've told classes in the past,

01:03:05.719 --> 01:03:09.840
even though they're way on the other side of the planet,

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:13.559
you can't just make that appear in a video.

01:03:13.559 --> 01:03:17.559
It's not like being there and receiving that education.

01:03:17.559 --> 01:03:21.159
So the numbers have gone up now.

01:03:21.159 --> 01:03:23.800
You had more of you that are on branch committees

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:26.920
and others that'll take Gilead's training

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:30.760
and offer themselves and strengthen as you can.

01:03:31.719 --> 01:03:33.159
So good results.

01:03:33.159 --> 01:03:36.519
Jehovah gets all the praise and glory,

01:03:36.519 --> 01:03:39.440
but Gilead has been blessing

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:42.760
to the earthly part of Jehovah's organization.

01:03:43.519 --> 01:03:48.119
Now finally, just these brief comments for you.

01:03:49.679 --> 01:03:54.679
Very brief at the graduation, the 52nd class, see.

01:03:56.079 --> 01:03:58.960
Brother North stressed the need for the graduates

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:00.440
to be humble.

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:03.960
Now you've heard that quite a few times during class

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:08.639
and they intensify it toward the last couple of weeks,

01:04:08.639 --> 01:04:12.320
if I know these instructors like I think I do,

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:15.280
being lowly in mind when you're teaching others,

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:16.840
Brother North told them,

01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:20.199
you can't overemphasize being humble.

01:04:21.159 --> 01:04:23.519
Just can't overemphasize it.

01:04:23.519 --> 01:04:27.840
It's crucial for Jehovah to use this continually.

01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:31.480
And we believe that same message goes for you

01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:35.280
in class 150 of the Brother North gave class 52,

01:04:36.239 --> 01:04:41.239
be humble, teach others with a lowlyness of mind, see.

01:04:42.159 --> 01:04:46.760
So you humbly rendering your sacred service

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:51.840
to Jehovah God is gonna cause your heavenly Father

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:53.000
to rejoice.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.519
Don't cause them to rejoice and we know you will.
