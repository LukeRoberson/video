WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This project is unique because it is the first kingdom hall in the archipelago, but what

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.439
is also unique is that we have decided to divide the work up into five different phases.

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:23.760
That would enable five different teams to come to build two kingdom halls within 28 days.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.559
Each team replaces the previous one.

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:31.920
We arrive in St. Pia by airplane from Quebec City, while the other team flies to Goose Bay,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.200
which is 800 kilometers away in Labrador.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.880
A few weeks before the work began, we sent two trailers with tools and materials so that

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.409
everything would be ready for the arrival of the first team.

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:53.649
The most precious things we have on the building site are not the building materials, but

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:55.969
our volunteers.

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:02.869
They are obedient and they manifest the fruitage of the spirit, including joy.

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:12.129
When we work joyfully, everything runs smoothly, everything goes well.

00:01:12.129 --> 00:01:19.170
We take care of the home with the volunteers today, making sure that all of our guests

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.969
are comfortable and ready for their work.

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:25.209
We look after our 40 children, if you like.

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:31.569
Yes, that's it, their mother.

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:35.849
The job of the first team was to put up the building structure.

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:44.090
They installed the walls, the roof trusses, the roof panels, and the asphalt shingles.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.689
The work of the second team was to install the plumbing, then the insulation.

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:55.489
We closed up the walls with the drywall.

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:58.769
It's going to be hard to leave Sampierre and Michelin.

00:01:58.769 --> 00:02:03.329
For me, it is truly an honor to be here with my brothers and sisters.

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.730
I'm just so happy.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.330
Everything was ready for the arrival of team three.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:19.530
They took care of the drywall taping, the painting, and the installation of the suspended

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.939
ceiling.

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:34.960
Building four installed the floor coverings, the carpet, the tiles, they poured concrete

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.479
pathways.

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:42.000
It's amazing to feel like a tool in Jehovah's hands.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.599
Once again, we have seen our international unity.

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:55.240
And finally, the last team, team five, carried out the finishing work, fitting the doors,

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:02.479
finishing the trim, the sound system, the furniture, and the sign on the building that identifies

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:11.900
the kingdom hall of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.139
I thank Jehovah every night for our kingdom hall.

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:20.819
I am infinitely grateful that he has given us this wonderful gift.

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.939
It's a unique opportunity to give a witness.

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:25.939
It's incredible.

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:27.740
It's a lot of work.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:28.740
But it's really worth it.
