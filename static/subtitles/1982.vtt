00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.219
and introduction to the Book of Hebrews.

00:00:05.219 --> 00:00:16.660
Paul wrote this letter in about 61 CE, shortly before or after his release from house arrest in Rome.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:23.660
The information in the letter indicates that it was intended for Hebrew Christians living in Judea.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.660
Many had been Christians for years.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.659
Yet spiritually speaking, some of these had gone back to needing milk, not solid food.

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:40.659
This put their faith at risk because it was under attack by the Jewish religious leaders and their supporters.

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:48.659
The opposers may have argued that Christians had no visible realities to aid them in their worship.

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:59.659
The Jews, however, had a magnificent temple, a priesthood, animal sacrifices, the law of Moses, and a history dating back to Abraham.

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:09.659
Paul wrote to the Hebrew Christians to strengthen their faith in the far superior heavenly realities centered on Christ.

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.659
Those realities place Christian worship high above that of fleshly Israel.

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:22.659
Paul's letter may have also been helpful to Hebrew Christians who were still holding on to the Mosaic Law.

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.659
The letter to the Hebrews has 13 chapters.

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:33.659
Chapters 1 through 3 set the theme for Hebrews by describing Jesus' elevated position.

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.659
He is superior both to the angels and to Moses.

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:47.659
In chapters 4 through 10, we see Jesus as heavenly high priest, far above the sinful Jewish high priests serving at the temple.

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.659
Unlike them, Jesus is perfect and without sin.

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:04.659
The Jewish high priests had to offer sacrifices daily for the sins of the people, and they offered animal sacrifices, which had limited value.

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:13.659
Christ entered into heaven itself to present to God the value of his perfect human life as a ransom once in for all time.

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:23.099
Jesus' ransom also provides the basis for a new and better covenant compared with the one mediated by Moses.

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.099
Did you know? At Hebrews 9 verse 9 we read,

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.099
this tent is an illustration.

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:36.099
Paul was here referring to the earthly tent or tabernacle that Moses set up.

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:45.949
Worship centered on that tent and its animal sacrifices could not provide complete forgiveness of sins.

00:02:46.949 --> 00:03:04.960
The far greater tent not made with hands, which is the arrangement for worship being Jehovah on the basis of Christ's ransom sacrifice, provides all we need to have a personal and everlasting relationship with God.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:15.960
In chapter 10, we read that Christ's followers should meet together regularly to encourage one another, and all the more so as the end draws near.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:27.500
Chapter 11 focuses on faith, giving many examples of pre-Christian men and women who by faith were made powerful and word-indeed.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:35.939
In chapter 12, we read that these courageous men and women make up a great cloud of witnesses.

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:43.939
The Apostle then points to the greatest witness of all, Jesus Christ, who is the chief agent and perfector of our faith.

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:49.180
Christ like faith must, of course, be reflected in holy conduct.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.180
So Paul's final exhortations in chapter 13 include the words,

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:06.620
Let your brotherly love continue, let marriage be honorable among all, and be obedient to those who are taking the lead among you.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:13.620
As you read the book of Hebrews, note how Paul beautifully shows the superior nature of Christian worship,

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.620
how we can continue to perfect our faith as we await the end of Satan's world,

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:27.620
and how Jesus, our heavenly high priest and the King of God's kingdom, is used by God to eliminate sin and death forever.
