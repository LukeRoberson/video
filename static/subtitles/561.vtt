00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:08.580
Patience, let's turn to James chapter 1 verse 19.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.179
Here the scripture reads,

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:12.900
Know this, my beloved brothers.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.460
Everyone must be quick to listen that requires patience.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.260
Slow to speak, patience, slow to anger.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.500
So even though the word patience isn't used in this text, we do have to exert patience,

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.539
and it is speaking about patience.

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:40.100
patience is not only about waiting, it's also about how you wait, what your attitude

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.579
about waiting is, and the spirit you show while you're waiting, for example, you're in

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.380
traffic, stuck.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:54.020
You're in a long line at a store waiting to pay for the merchandise you'd like to purchase.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:00.500
You're getting very slow service at a restaurant, or you're waiting for someone who is slow

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.980
for an appointment, or to complete an assignment.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.299
How do you wait?

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:09.780
We want to wait with patience.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.500
We have a wonderful example in the scriptures, Elihu, is the man in Job, will turn their

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.579
Job chapter 32.

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:22.620
We can learn some lessons about patience from Elihu.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:29.219
He had genuine love for Jehovah God and very deep respect for truth, and when he heard

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:35.500
some of the foolish, untrue things that Job's three companions were saying, and also from

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:42.959
Job himself, it irritated him, and we can read about his irritation, really righteous

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:48.980
indignation, we'd call it, had Job 32 verses 1 through 3.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.540
It says, so these three men stopped trying to answer Job because he was convinced of

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.540
his own righteousness.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:02.540
But Elihu, the son of Barakel, the buzzer of the family of Ram, had become very angry.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.939
His anger blazed against Job for trying to prove himself right rather than God.

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:13.819
He was also very angry with Job's three companions because they could not find an answer, but

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.819
had declared God wicked.

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.819
Isn't that interesting?

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.340
Elihu, he waited with great patience.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.539
He didn't interrupt Job or his three companions, those false comforters, even though he could

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:32.379
see clearly, they were terribly mistaken in what they were saying.

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:39.139
In fact, they lied about Jehovah God, and they made false accusations against Job.

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:43.939
So he did indeed have righteous indignation, but there's one thing we notice.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.939
He gave an example that we can imitate.

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.340
He waited to speak.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.379
He had patience before he revealed his feelings.

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:01.219
Let's read verses 4 through 6, Job 32, 4 through 6.

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:09.139
Elihu had been waiting to respond to Job because they were older than he was.

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:15.180
And Elihu saw that the three men had nothing to say in answer, his anger flared up.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.539
So Elihu, the son of Barakal, the buzzer, began to speak, saying, I am young, and you

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:23.139
men are aged.

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:30.379
So I respectfully held back, and I dared not tell you what I know.

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:34.539
What lesson can we learn here about patience?

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:39.099
Don't interrupt other people when they're having a conversation.

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:40.819
Can't you see people do that?

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.259
You may be conversing with somebody, and some will just walk up and interrupt immediately

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:48.979
and insert himself, inject himself in your conversation.

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:50.580
Really, that's rude.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.379
It's not the right thing to do.

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:56.939
I remember one time when I was at the Stanley Theater.

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:01.539
There was a brother there that I wanted to greet, that he was having a conversation with

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:02.539
a sister.

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:04.620
This was a very prominent brother.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.780
And so in my enthusiasm, I walked up to him, and I interrupted the conversation to greet

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:10.780
him.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.379
Well, what happened to me on that occasion?

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:21.779
He looked at me with a withering look of reproach for my bad manners.

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:22.779
What a good lesson.

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:24.060
He was right.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.819
I was wrong to interrupt a conversation that it was obvious that he was having with another

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:30.819
person.

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:33.779
So we need to learn, because it's our inclination sometimes.

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:34.779
We want to be heard.

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:38.379
We think we've got something to say that's important, but is it really more important than

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:40.500
what the people are talking about?

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.420
Those that we interrupt, and some just seem to have the habit of interrupting.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:51.060
So the lesson is don't be rude and interrupt conversations that others are engaged in,

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.459
even if you feel that what you have to say is more important.

00:04:54.459 --> 00:04:59.019
Don't interrupt unless the building is burning down.

00:04:59.019 --> 00:05:03.779
So what you have to say also might not be as important as you think it is.

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:11.300
There's another lesson we can learn here from Elihu in Job 32 versus 11 and 12.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.779
Notice what it says.

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:16.980
Look, I have waited for your words.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.500
I kept listening to your reasoning.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:26.699
As you searched for things to say, I paid close attention to you, but none of you could

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:31.259
prove Job wrong or answer his arguments.

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:39.139
He listened closely to what was being said by the three false comforters and also by Job.

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:43.860
He got all the facts before he spoke, isn't that a good lesson?

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.740
Sometimes we may jump to a conclusion about somebody, his motive for doing something

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.660
or saying something, and we only have partial information, and then we find out I should

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:54.660
have been quiet.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.500
I should not have said anything.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:03.259
I'm embarrassed about my own foolishness because I jumped to a conclusion about this person.

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:10.300
So like Elihu, we should avoid jumping to conclusions about a person's motive for saying

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.060
or doing something.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:17.620
We may be mistaken, especially if we react before hearing the reasons why a person said

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.019
or did what he did.

00:06:20.019 --> 00:06:25.699
Being patient can save us from unnecessary embarrassment.

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:29.459
So it's a good idea to show patience.

00:06:29.459 --> 00:06:34.139
Elihu's patience was truly remarkable also because he was a man of passion.

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:40.060
You can tell that he had very strong feelings about the truth and speaking the truth, the

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:45.620
way he was agitated over what Job's three false comforters were saying.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.779
He wanted to correct matters.

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:54.459
He knew that Job's three friends didn't speak the truth about Jehovah, they lied, about

00:06:54.459 --> 00:07:01.540
Job they were lying, but he contained himself until they were finished speaking.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.620
What an interesting account.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:09.540
Actually, let's turn to Job 32, 17 to 20.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:13.819
This is how he felt, and sometimes you may feel this way, highly agitated, you feel you

00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:19.060
just have to say something, but it's important sometimes, especially when you really feel

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:26.060
that way to hold back a bit versus 17 through 20.

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:32.220
So I too will give an answer, I too will tell what I know for I am full of words.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:35.139
The spirit within me compels me.

00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:41.860
My insides are like wine that has no vent like new wine skins ready to burst.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.220
Let me speak so that I can find relief.

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:50.100
I will open my lips and give an answer, but isn't it interesting?

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:57.500
This is how the man felt, but he exercised control over his own person.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:03.980
He exercised restraint in coming for speaking what he felt over perhaps quite a long period

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:09.379
of time while the three so-called friends of Job were criticizing Job and then Job's

00:08:09.379 --> 00:08:10.860
reply.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:17.500
He stood there, or sat there, and listened, paid attention, controlled himself, and at

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.740
the right time he spoke.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:27.899
And we do know that his anger did indeed blaze against Job and against his three companions.

00:08:27.899 --> 00:08:33.379
We can detect his anger in the first verses of chapter 32.

00:08:33.379 --> 00:08:39.179
But what's fascinating about the way Elihu handled matters when you go to chapter 33,

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:44.340
when it came time to give counsel, he said a good example for all of us in the family,

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:48.220
when it comes time to give a person counsel, even if we're highly irritated over something

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:51.620
he or she did or said.

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.500
Let's read verses one through seven.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:09:02.259
Elihu says, but now Job, please hear my words, listen to everything I say, look, please,

00:09:02.259 --> 00:09:04.620
I must open my mouth.

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.019
My tongue must speak.

00:09:07.019 --> 00:09:14.139
My words declare the uprightness of my heart, and my lips sincerely tell what I know.

00:09:14.139 --> 00:09:20.700
God's own spirit made me, and the Almighty's own breath brought me to life, replied to me

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.379
if you are able.

00:09:22.379 --> 00:09:27.580
Present your arguments before me, take your position, and notice this wonderful expression

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:28.899
of fellow-feeling.

00:09:28.899 --> 00:09:35.659
Look, I am just like you before the true God, from the clay I too was shaped.

00:09:35.659 --> 00:09:41.700
So no fear of me should terrify you, and no pressure from me should overwhelm you.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:42.700
What a wonderful example.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:48.299
We might get highly irritated at somebody and feel he really needs to be talked to.

00:09:48.299 --> 00:09:54.139
Perhaps we feel that he needs a severe reprimand, but we need to do it with love.

00:09:54.139 --> 00:09:59.299
Elihu was a friend, and you can tell when a person gives you counsel.

00:09:59.299 --> 00:10:05.820
If he's giving you counsel just because he's angry at you, or if he's counseling you,

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.379
because he loves you, you're his friend and he wants to be of help.

00:10:09.379 --> 00:10:12.460
That's the example that Elihu said for us.

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:18.299
So what good lessons for all of us from Elihu about patience and good manners?
