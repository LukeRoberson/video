00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.139
It's true, isn't it? When we look at this prophecy in the book of Micah, it's very exciting

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:13.859
because it portrays to us what's actually happening among God's people today.

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:19.059
We know that, although in the New World, there will be a tremendous unity displayed by

00:00:19.059 --> 00:00:25.660
God's people, chapter 4 of Micah is actually portraying what's happening now, and we'll

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.300
involve with this. We know that because in verse 5 says, at the same time that this unity

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.060
would be evident, all the peoples will walk each in the name of its God. Well, that's not

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.500
talking about the New World, is it? It's talking about the time we're living in now. But what

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:49.619
is it that helps all of Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide to be so united and not to be involved

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:55.780
with the wars of this world? Well, one of the things that helps us is our Christian neutrality.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:04.260
What do we mean by neutrality? We mean not taking sides and political issues. Of course,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.260
we take sides with Jehovah and the Kingdom, but with regard to worldly political debates and

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:17.700
issues that arise, we don't take sides. Why is this so important? Well, let's turn our

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:29.540
Bibles to Revelation chapter 13, Revelation 13 verses 16 and 17. And here it tells us, it puts

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.980
under compulsion, all people, the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:41.780
slaves, that these should be marked on their right hand and on their fard, and that nobody can

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:49.060
buy or sell except a person having the mark, the name of the wild beast, of the number of its name,

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:56.659
or the number of its name. What's the point of this verse? Well, of course, we will look forward to

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.739
seeing how this may turn out in the future and what pressure is put on God's people at that time.

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:09.780
But even now we see the principle here that the political system is wanting to put its mark on us,

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.419
mentally as well as physically, so we see the fard as well as the hand being involved.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:24.340
So we need to be absolutely certain that we remain neutral with regard to political issues in

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:32.580
the world, not only by not being involved actively in the political issues, but also mentally,

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:38.979
not allowing ourselves to take sides. What are some of the things that perhaps could erode

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:47.219
our neutrality? Well, maybe we could mention three things this morning. One is the propaganda

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:52.900
that the world puts forward. And we have seen what the media says about your harvest witnesses,

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:59.139
haven't we? How distorted some of their reports are and how they can paint a negative picture with

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:06.099
regard to us? Well, should we expect that they are neutral with regard to other events that they

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:12.500
report on? Particularly when there are conflicts between two nations. The media in one particular

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:20.580
nation may promote certain ideas about the other nation. We may be affected by that. We may be surprised

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.740
perhaps to visit some other countries that have a different political ideology and be surprised to

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.659
see how things perhaps were a little different in that country to how it's portrayed by the media

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:38.659
in our country. So we need to be careful not to be influenced by the propaganda of this world,

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:45.539
particularly media reports and so on. What's another thing perhaps that could cause us to lose a

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:54.259
measure of neutrality? Sporting events. Sometimes sporting events are able to achieve certain goals

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:58.979
with regard to nationalism. We see the national anthem being played many of these events.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.860
Reminds me many years ago when I was in a different country. A friend of mine asked me to record

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.219
a certain sporting event. I wasn't particularly interested in the event, but because he made this

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:17.139
request, I recorded it. And of course, I wanted to make sure that I'd got the last 10 minutes of it.

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:22.180
I thought a friendship may be strained if I didn't get the actual last part of the game.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.100
But I watched it. It was absolutely exciting, now biting finish.

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:35.060
Well, after the brother gave me back the video tape, I thought maybe some of the other brothers who

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.540
would be interested in this sporting event may want to have it rather than just wipe the tape.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:46.899
So offered it to several. And each one of them said to me, no, thanks. If we had one, perhaps it would

00:04:46.899 --> 00:04:53.459
be different. Now, what was the problem? As I said to them, were you watching the game or were

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:59.300
you taking sides? An interesting concept, because here two different nations were involved.

00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:07.060
So we have to be careful that even sporting events don't stir up within us certain nationalistic

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:15.540
feelings. And perhaps we could take sides with regard to certain events. The third area that perhaps

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:22.899
could erode our neutrality, the political promises being made, particularly the election time.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:31.139
Perhaps one of the candidates is from our ethnic background, or perhaps it's the same gender as we are.

00:05:32.579 --> 00:05:37.860
When we look at the political situation, these days with many elections, it seems to be more in the

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:46.100
form of entertainment than anything else with music and very colorful characters. But if we were to

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:55.060
say in our heart, I hope that idiot doesn't get into power. Are we neutral? Or we're still, if we say,

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:01.139
I hope the other person gets into power. Well, we need to be careful, don't we? I remember many

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:07.939
years ago as a young pioneer in Australia, I was facing the conscription issue, the national

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:13.860
call up for the military at that time. The Vietnam War was being fought. And then there was an

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:20.180
election in Australia. And at that time, the party that was trying to get into power said that if

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:26.819
they got into power, they would abolish conscription. So now that affected me personally. I remember

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:33.220
how hard it was sitting there watching the election results, not to say in my heart, I hope they

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:42.100
get in. And then when they got in, not to say, yes. You see, if we personally are affected by some

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:50.339
of these political promises, we may violate our neutrality. So brothers and sisters, let's work hard

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:56.579
at remembering that we're no part of this world. We support the best government that could ever

00:06:56.579 --> 00:07:06.259
rule this earth. And by doing so, we will keep our neutrality and we will keep our unity.
