00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.289
Do you enjoy a good story?

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:12.289
If so, you're in for a special treat.

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:16.289
A people for Jehovah's name at World Headquarters in Warwick

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.289
is more than a history museum.

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.289
It's the modern-day story of a people seeking to know the true God

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.289
and to do his will.

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.289
But this isn't just any story.

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.289
It's our story.

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.289
So let's take a thrilling journey back in time.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.600
The story unfolds on the narrative wall

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.600
and in several galleries along the way.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.600
We begin in the 1870s

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.600
when a small group in Allegheny, Pennsylvania

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.600
decided to re-examine the Bible

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.600
as CT Russell reasoned.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.600
All the creeds of Christendom claim to be founded on the Bible

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.600
and these are conflicting.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.600
Is it possible that the Bible has been misrepresented?

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.599
The more they learned, the more they wanted to share.

00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:10.599
So in 1879, they began publishing Zion's watchtower.

00:01:10.599 --> 00:01:13.599
Readers were soon taking a stand for the truth

00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:15.599
that they were learning.

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:16.599
Listen.

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:19.599
What I want to tell you is this.

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:21.599
I am free.

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:24.599
The truth has made me free.

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:28.599
Today, I was excluded from the Baptist Church.

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:34.599
So I am all alone in the flesh, but not in the Spirit.

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:37.599
They became known as the Bible students

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:40.599
and they soon realized that people everywhere

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:42.599
should hear the good news.

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:46.599
But how could this small group preach the Bible's message

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:48.599
Earthwide?

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:51.599
Transcontinental and international tours

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:55.599
helped them to see how they could expand their preaching work

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:56.599
even further.

00:01:56.599 --> 00:02:00.599
In just one tour, beginning in December 1911,

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:05.599
CT Russell and his associates traveled completely around the world.

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:11.599
Let's imagine what it was like to live in those exciting times.

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:16.599
In this gallery, you can experience what life was like for Pilgrim

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.599
or what we today call a circuit overseer.

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.599
Here's a Pilgrim's formal jacket that he'd wear when giving a public talk.

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.599
The Bible students offered the studies in the Scriptures series

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:34.599
in the ministry and they carried lists to locate and visit

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.599
Watchtower subscribers.

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:42.599
Then in 1914, they presented the exciting photo drama of creation.

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:48.599
Its purpose was to build faith in the Bible as God's inspired word.

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:54.599
It was an innovative combination of moving pictures, sound recordings,

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.599
and beautiful hand-colored glass slides.

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.599
Hundreds of people reenacted Bible scenes.

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.599
Some with live animals.

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:11.599
Was this enormous work worth all the effort?

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:20.599
Dear Brother Russell, I want to thank you so much for the privilege of seeing the photo drama of creation.

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:26.599
I had never thought to live to see the everlasting gospel preached to those who dwell on the earth,

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:28.599
yet so it is.

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.599
Words cannot tell you how my heart rejoices.

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:34.599
Your sister, F.E. Riley.

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:40.599
By the end of 1914, over nine million had viewed it.

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:47.599
But with such success, the Bible students didn't realize what tests lay ahead.

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:55.819
The Gentile times have ended.

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.819
Their kings have had their day.

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:05.599
So we know not what awaits us.

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:08.599
World War I broke out in 1914.

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:14.599
Then in 1916, the death of C.T. Russell left the Bible students in shock.

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:18.600
It was a unique time of testing.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.600
Inside the organization, some struggled over who should take the lead.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.600
Outside, governments tried to force them to take sides in the war.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:37.600
Then, in 1918, J.F. Rutherford and seven of his close associates were imprisoned.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.600
Was this the end for the Bible students?

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.600
Or would they prove to be a people for Jehovah's name?

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.600
The joy that came with the release of our brothers from the Atlanta Federal Prison on Tuesday,

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.600
March 25, 1919, knew no bounds.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:02.600
Their further devotion to Jehovah was shown in the fact that they immediately set to work

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:08.600
to herald forth to the people of God everywhere the knowledge of Jehovah's deliverance.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.600
Thomas Sullivan.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.600
The Bible students moved forward with renewed zeal.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:20.810
But the opposition didn't end there.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:26.810
In this gallery, you will see how our brothers and sisters have stood firm for their faith.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:35.810
In Russia, a father imprisoned for ten years encouraged his young daughters with hand-drawn postcards.

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:43.810
In Greece, a son used the same blanket in prison that his father used when imprisoned before him.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.810
It was an encouraging reminder of his father's integrity.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:55.810
In Korea, witnesses were locked in tiny cells for up to thirty days at a time.

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:01.810
When you stand in the lighted outline, you get a sense of what it was like.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:11.730
All of these brothers and sisters look beyond the prison bars to their firm hope for the future.

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:19.730
As light from God's word increased, the Bible students humbly let go of cherished but unscriptural traditions.

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:25.730
Songs used in worship were examined in the light of what the Bible taught.

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.730
The people for Jehovah's name were becoming even more evident.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:37.730
So in 1931, they were thrilled to take on their new name Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:45.730
Then in 1935, Brother Rutherford identified the great multitude of other sheep who served alongside the anointed.

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:49.730
At the climax of his talk, he asked,

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:55.730
Will all those who have the hope of living forever on the earth please stand?

00:06:55.730 --> 00:07:01.730
With this new understanding, they saw the true scope of Jesus' commission to make disciples.

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:05.730
New and innovative methods were needed.

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:13.069
Our third gallery shows the preaching methods used in the 1930s and 1940s.

00:07:13.069 --> 00:07:21.069
Radio was a powerful way to spread the kingdom message to large audiences.

00:07:21.069 --> 00:07:29.069
They also used large phonographs called portable transcription machines with loudspeakers mounted on sound cars.

00:07:29.069 --> 00:07:35.069
Brothers played recorded talks wherever people gathered.

00:07:35.069 --> 00:07:43.069
Lighter phonographs were also designed and produced, so publishers could take the recorded message directly to people at home.

00:07:43.069 --> 00:07:47.069
These methods helped bring unity to the message.

00:07:47.069 --> 00:07:55.069
But the time had come to train each one of Jehovah's people to be an effective witness.

00:07:55.069 --> 00:07:57.069
Schools were started.

00:07:57.069 --> 00:08:01.069
The course in theocratic ministry trained publishers in the congregation.

00:08:01.069 --> 00:08:07.069
And the Bible School of Gilead began training missionaries for global expansion.

00:08:07.069 --> 00:08:13.069
We had entered into a new era of divine education.

00:08:13.069 --> 00:08:17.069
And we were about to receive an amazing tool.

00:08:17.069 --> 00:08:23.069
In 1950, we received the new world translation of the Christian Greek scriptures.

00:08:23.069 --> 00:08:28.069
And by 1961, the complete Bible was released.

00:08:28.069 --> 00:08:34.070
Since then, we've seen our tools continue to improve with the wise use of modern technology.

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:41.070
From high speed printing to the internet and video, these methods help us to stay unified.

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:45.070
Reach millions with the good news and glorify God.

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:51.070
Yes, this museum's story is about people, but not just any people.

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:54.070
We are a people for Jehovah's name.

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:57.070
Only one question remains.

00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:00.070
What will you contribute to this wonderful story?
