00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:14.509
At Hebrews 8.1, the Apostle Paul wrote,

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.510
now this is the main point of what we are saying.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.210
When we teach, we want our main points to stand out.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.410
Why?

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.710
Well, which is easier to listen to,

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.210
a rambling discourse that outlines seemingly unrelated facts,

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.710
or an organized presentation with main points that relate to the theme.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.109
When we make our main points stand out,

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:43.909
we help our audience to pay attention,

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:48.509
understand, and remember what we say.

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:53.310
So how can you make the main points stand out?

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.509
First, decide on the objective of your talk.

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:59.710
Aim to accomplish something.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.710
If you don't know your objective, neither will your audience.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.109
Do you want to inform?

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:12.810
Convince, encourage, motivate, or something else.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.709
For example, let's say that you're discussing the resurrection.

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:22.409
If you're speaking to a grieving family made up of fellow Christians,

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.909
your objective may be to give encouragement and comfort.

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.609
On the other hand, if you're speaking about the resurrection

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:33.909
to unbelieving relatives who have questioned your beliefs,

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.909
your objective might be to convince them.

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.109
In each instance, the main points you choose will be different

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:45.109
because the objective is different.

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:48.109
So when preparing, select only main points

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:50.909
that help you achieve your objective

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.109
and that you can teach effectively in the allotted time.

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:59.310
Then develop the points in a logical order.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.109
Ask yourself.

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:06.810
What questions or objections might my audience have about this topic?

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.860
In what logical order would they raise those questions or objections?

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.259
Often, however, we are given an outline to develop

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:23.060
and the main points have already been selected and put in a certain order.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.259
In such a case, analyze the outline to have clearly in mind,

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:30.060
the objective of the talk,

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:34.960
and how the main points will help you to reach that objective.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.960
As you give the talk, you don't want the audience to lose sight of your theme.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.759
So at various times during your discourse,

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:48.259
repeat key words in the theme or use synonyms.

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:51.759
Your audience will remember only a few main points

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:54.460
so don't develop too many.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.159
Even if you're giving a longer talk,

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:01.560
focus on developing a few points well.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.860
As you develop secondary points,

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.560
explain their connection to the main point.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.060
Don't add ideas just because they're interesting.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.759
To make your main points stand out,

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:16.460
you might repeat in a sentence or two

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.960
each main point before going on to the next,

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.360
or you might state the main points in the introduction

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.360
and then restate them in the conclusion.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.960
When you finish, the audience should be able to remember the main points.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.159
Let's watch a brother who's in the middle of giving a talk,

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:43.159
see if you can discern the main point he's developing and his theme.

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:47.360
Let's turn to Proverbs 281.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.069
Here, the righteous are compared to a very impressive animal.

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.770
The wicked flee when no one pursues them,

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.569
but the righteous are as confident as a lion.

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.069
You and I can be like a lion.

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.169
Imagine that.

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:08.169
Bible writers were familiar with lions

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:11.069
because they were once plentiful in Israel,

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.969
although they are now extinct there.

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:18.370
A lion's thunderous roar can be heard for miles.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.269
They can move at a speed of 40 miles per hour.

00:04:22.269 --> 00:04:26.870
They are so powerful that a single blow from a lion's paw

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.769
is enough to break the neck of a small antelope.

00:04:30.769 --> 00:04:33.069
According to insight on the scriptures,

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:37.970
the lion serves as a fitting symbol of courageous justice.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:45.040
And so Jesus is called the lion that is of the tribe of Judah.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.740
Could you tell from that talk what the theme is?

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.939
Is it something about lions?

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:54.439
Jesus, the righteous?

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:59.939
Actually, the theme of this talk is Jehovah makes us bold.

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:03.939
What's the main point that the speaker was trying to develop?

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:07.939
Jehovah is the source of true boldness.

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:10.339
Let's watch the speaker try again.

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:16.939
This time, notice how he emphasizes the theme and main point.

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:19.939
Let's turn to Proverbs 281.

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:23.939
As we read this verse, look for the answer to this question.

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:27.939
What sort of people can be truly confident?

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:33.040
The wicked flee when no one pursues them,

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.040
but the righteous are as confident as a lion.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.540
So who can be confident?

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.540
The righteous?

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.540
And who are the righteous?

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.540
Those who have faith in the ransom

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.040
and who strive to adhere to Jehovah's requirements?

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.540
Here's the point.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:03.540
Confidence comes not from natural ability, education, or riches.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:10.040
The source of true boldness is our relationship with Jehovah.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.540
So when we go in the ministry, we don't need to be afraid.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:19.540
We're doing what Jehovah requires and Jehovah is supporting us.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:24.540
Remembering this will help us to preach with boldness.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:31.540
This time, the speaker introduced the scripture in a way that called attention to the main point.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.540
He avoided cluttering his talk with details that didn't support his point.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.540
And to make sure the audience got the main point, he told them,

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.540
here's the point.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.540
Then he connected the point to the theme.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.819
Whether from the platform or in the ministry,

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:52.819
our teaching should be simple and clear.

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:59.819
If we group our thoughts under just a few main points that relate to our objective and theme,

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:04.819
our presentation will be easy to follow and hard to forget.
