00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:07.580
What would you think, and how would you feel if I showed up to give this talk but had done nothing to prepare what to say to you?

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:14.080
I had not bothered to study the outline I was given, could not remember the theme, had no idea what the main points are,

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:22.079
and would have to guess at what scriptures to use to support them. And then as I spoke, I would ramble in coherently and make a very bad impression.

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:30.280
I know how I would feel, I would be a nervous wreck, and you would wonder why I did not think enough of you to put all the time and effort

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:36.479
that was necessary into preparing the talk so that you could get the most benefit from it.

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:45.979
Can you see where I'm going with this? Could the same things be said if you engaged in the ministry without first preparing what to say?

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:51.979
You did not review the sample conversations that had been provided, could not think of how to start a conversation,

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:58.979
and did not know what scripture to share. How nervous would you be, and what would the householder think of you?

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:08.680
It would likely be a very short, uncomfortable conversation, and the other person may not care to have you call again.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.680
We should take some time to prepare well before we preach. Why?

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:26.079
Because we have the best message ever, the good news of peace to share with people, and we should do our best so that they will want to listen to what we have to say.

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:35.280
Jesus helped his disciples to prepare for the ministry. Luke chapter 10 reports that before sending out 70 disciples to preach,

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.780
he shared with them a pleasant way to greet each householder, told them what to talk about, the kingdom of God,

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:48.379
and he told them how to respond to the varied reactions they would get in their territory.

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:56.480
As a result, because the disciples were fully prepared for the ministry, they enjoyed some thrilling experiences.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:04.579
When we are prepared, we are more poised, enthusiastic, and can truly enjoy the ministry.

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:19.990
As you watch the following video, notice the good results of preparing well.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:28.560
We made some good changes, but we weren't done.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.360
I asked Yuri what she planned to talk about.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:40.560
That started the usual scramble, and we got it, the sample conversation.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:03:09.819
That'll do, but for that to work, I had to remember the scripture.

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.120
We were both a little forgetful that morning.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:22.550
Yeah, we needed to prepare better.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:35.860
We'd been relying on our experience and not enough on Jehovah, so first we prepared our hearts,

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:51.840
then we prepared our minds and found new ways to use our preaching tools,

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.340
even a little preparation for initial calls.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:16.220
And our return visits went a long way.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.720
The husband said, yeah, we needed to prepare better.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.720
Have you ever thought that about your ministry?

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.519
Like the couple in the video, we can first prepare our heart and our mind,

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:32.720
and then see how best to use our preaching tools.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.019
Our goal should be the same as that of the Apostle Paul.

00:04:37.019 --> 00:04:46.720
At 1 Corinthians 9, verse 23, he wrote that he wanted to do all things for the sake of the good news

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.819
in order to share it with others.

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:55.120
So let's think about some specific things we can do to prepare well,

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.319
beginning with what we can say on the initial call,

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:03.819
whether that is done in person or over the telephone.

00:05:04.019 --> 00:05:09.220
Each issue of the Christian life and ministry meeting workbook provides us with sample conversations

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.819
and give us some helpful ideas.

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:16.519
Of course, you may modify the samples or use something entirely different.

00:05:16.519 --> 00:05:24.019
Perhaps a subject from a previous month or a different scripture would have wider appeal in your territory.

00:05:24.019 --> 00:05:30.720
Your opening words may be the most important part of the presentation, so think it through.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.420
If the introduction does not arouse interest, the other person may terminate the conversation

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.120
before we can give a witness.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.620
We will be more effective if we carefully prepare the first sentence or two

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.519
that we will say after giving a customary greeting.

00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:52.620
We might say, many people are concerned about

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.720
or I would like to get your opinion on

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.819
or say something else.

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:01.819
Then pick a topic that is of local interest

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:09.120
and ask a wellward viewpoint question that will draw the person into the conversation.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.620
Now, what about preparing for return visits?

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.519
That actually begins on the initial call

00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:21.620
by leaving a question for the person to think about until you call again.

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:27.420
That is how the sample initial calls and return visits are set up in the median workbook.

00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:31.819
By leaving a thought-provoking question at the end of every visit

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:37.819
we can keep the chain of conversations going as long as possible.

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:39.720
We can illustrate it this way.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.019
Imagine a freight train with an engine at the front, a caboose of the rear,

00:06:44.019 --> 00:06:46.420
and many cars in between.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:51.620
What keeps all those cars moving together down the train track?

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.620
There is a device called a coupler at the back of each train car

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.120
that latches onto the coupler at the front of the car behind it.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.620
By being coupled or linked together,

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:07.519
the cars all run as a unit along the track.

00:07:07.519 --> 00:07:12.319
So the question that we leave with a householder at the end of one visit

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:16.519
is what we can latch onto at the beginning of our next visit

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:22.819
so that we can keep the train of thought going from one conversation to the next.

00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:24.319
For example,

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:26.920
on the initial call you could ask,

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.519
why is there so much suffering in the world?

00:07:30.519 --> 00:07:33.720
After discussing that, raise the question,

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.220
how does God feel about our suffering?

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:41.019
But don't answer the question until your next visit.

00:07:41.019 --> 00:07:44.420
After answering that question on the first return visit,

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.720
leave the person with this question,

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.920
what will God do to end our suffering

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.920
to be discussed on your next visit?

00:07:54.019 --> 00:07:59.819
It is also important to have an objective in mind for each return visit.

00:07:59.819 --> 00:08:01.019
Before making the call,

00:08:01.019 --> 00:08:04.920
think about what you want to accomplish on that call.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.019
If you raise a question,

00:08:06.019 --> 00:08:12.519
the last time your objective will surely include answering that question from the Bible.

00:08:12.519 --> 00:08:16.319
Of course, the ultimate objective is to try to start a Bible study

00:08:16.319 --> 00:08:20.670
in the enjoy life forever brochure.

00:08:20.769 --> 00:08:26.170
Now, what about preparing for the Bible studies that we conduct?

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:27.970
Even if we know the material very well,

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:33.269
we should prepare for each study session with our student in mind.

00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:39.769
That means thinking about and anticipating the views and needs of that individual.

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:44.669
What points might he struggle to understand or accept?

00:08:44.669 --> 00:08:50.870
It also means getting familiar with the lesson to be covered in our interactive Bible course.

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.070
Read the lesson carefully.

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:56.570
Look up the read scriptures to see how they apply.

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:59.870
Watch the videos that will be shown during the lesson

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:02.970
and review the items in the Explore section

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:07.870
so that you will know which of those will be especially helpful to your student.

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:13.370
Then you will be well prepared to conduct the study.

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:17.970
Since it is God who makes the seed of truth grow in a person's heart,

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:22.370
we should ask for Jehovah's blessing on our preparation for the study

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:27.340
so that we can best help the student spiritually.

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:33.240
And we will be more effective in our ministry if we stay up to date with the latest material and features

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:37.340
found on JW.org and in JW Library.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:41.039
So learn how to navigate the website and the app.

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:43.740
Two very helpful features on the website

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:48.840
are Bible questions answered under the Bible Teachings tab

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:53.740
and frequently asked questions under the About Us tab.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:59.440
They can also be found on the app under Article Series.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:06.340
The Apostle Paul described himself at 1 Corinthians 310 as a skilled master builder.

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:10.340
That is because he was engaging in a spiritual construction work

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.840
to build Christian disciples.

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:17.139
And we are doing the same sort of work when we engage in the ministry.

00:10:17.139 --> 00:10:22.240
But to build effectively, we must learn to use our tools well.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:27.340
We especially need to develop skill in using our principal tool, God's Word,

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:34.340
as well as learn how to make effective use of the publications in our teaching toolbox.

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:41.240
A builder who prepares before starting to work avoids mistakes and frustration.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.340
Remember what the brother said at the end of the video?

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:48.340
Even a little preparation goes a long way.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:53.139
And that is what will help you to do your best in the ministry.

00:10:53.139 --> 00:10:57.740
Just as Paul recommended at 2 Timothy 2 verse 15,

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:01.139
please follow along in your Bible, if you will.

00:11:01.139 --> 00:11:06.139
It's 2 Timothy 2 verse 15.

00:11:06.139 --> 00:11:10.940
Do your utmost to present yourself approved to God,

00:11:11.039 --> 00:11:18.039
a workman with nothing to be ashamed of, handling the word of the truth, a right.

00:11:18.039 --> 00:11:23.740
Then you will experience great joy in the spiritual building work that is taking place now

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:30.740
because you will be ready and well prepared to share the good news of peace.

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:33.539
Brother Anthony Morris, a member of the governing body,

00:11:33.539 --> 00:11:36.639
will now present the next talk of this symposium.

00:11:36.639 --> 00:11:39.240
Are you ready to share the good news of peace?

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.240
Take the initiative.
