00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:15.019
Saturday, October 4, 2014, Jersey City, New Jersey, Stanley Theater, excitement is building

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.500
an anticipation of the annual meeting of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.420
It is an event attended by Jehovah's Witnesses from around the world.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.260
What would be presented?

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.579
How would it affect the worldwide work of preaching the good news?

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.460
Should there be further light on the Scriptures?

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.859
Those questions would soon be answered.

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:41.219
Brother Mark Sanderson of the governing body served as the program chairman.

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.179
This is indeed a glorious day.

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:51.579
After 100 years of kingdom rule, this is no dull anniversary.

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:59.380
This is a day for us as Jehovah's people to rejoice and to thank Jehovah for all of the

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.299
things that he has accomplished over this past 100 years.

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:10.219
The popular animated series featuring Caleb and Sophia received comments of appreciation

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:14.180
from children throughout the world.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:27.739
The audience was treated to a new animated video for children.

00:01:27.739 --> 00:01:29.819
This message was clear.

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:33.219
Be a bold witness for Jehovah.

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:41.099
An announcement was made about a new software application for language learning that will

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:42.099
be most useful.

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:53.239
The governing body is releasing today the JW Language App.

00:01:53.239 --> 00:02:01.560
This was followed by another exciting development, JW Broadcasting, an English television station

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.920
that can be accessed via internet.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.560
This should prove to be a vital source of encouragement for God's people.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.960
Another treat was in store for the audience as they viewed a video entitled The Kingdom,

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.159
100 Years and Counting.

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:23.400
This inspiring presentation highlighted the accomplishments of God's kingdom over the

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.840
past 100 years.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:32.520
There is no question about the kingdom being in control.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.520
Neither David Splain of the governing body highlighted the importance of music in true

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.520
worship.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.400
There was wonderful news for all in attendance.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:58.889
A new song was written to celebrate 100 years of kingdom rule.

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:03.770
All in the audience were given the music and words and taught the new song.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.330
With the help of the Watchtower chorus, they learned the song quickly.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:15.610
It would be the first of three new songs that would be taught to the audience.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.210
Brother Garrett Lush, next interviewed some long-time Bethelites who expressed appreciation for

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.490
the progressive changes made in God's organization.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.330
From my standpoint, I think what the Psalmist said says it all.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.610
In Psalm 118, verse 23, this has come from Jehovah.

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.330
It's wonderful in our eyes.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.090
Further understanding of scriptural truth was delivered by Brother David Splain.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.409
He spoke in the theme types and anti-types.

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:50.530
We need to exercise great care when applying accounts in the Hebrew Scriptures as prophetic

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:58.569
patterns or types if these accounts are not applied in the Scriptures themselves.

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.729
We simply cannot go beyond what is written.

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:05.449
For the Scriptures identify them as such.

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:07.129
We embrace them.

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:12.849
But where the Bible is silent, we must be silent.

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:21.500
The audience learned another new song entitled Grant Us Boldness.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.500
Brother Stephen Let of the governing body gave further scriptural understanding in his talk.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.579
Will you keep on the watch?

00:04:29.579 --> 00:04:34.660
He based his talk on the parable of the Ten Virgins mentioned at Matthew chapter 25

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.579
verses 1 through 13.

00:04:36.579 --> 00:04:37.779
He asked,

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:41.779
How can each of us benefit from this parable today?

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:46.100
Obviously, this parable was meant to his counsel warning.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.699
To Christ, anointed followers that they had better keep on the watch.

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:56.500
There's an implied warning to the other sheep as to how they can be judged sheep rather

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.500
than goats.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.220
So Jehovah leaves no one out, does he?

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.740
The message of the parable is simple.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.139
Keep on the watch.

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:07.860
Next, Brother Anthony Morris of the governing body added further understanding in the talk

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.060
entitled The Parable of the Talents.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:19.459
So who has the five talents and who represents those having the two talents, some get the

00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:25.300
workload of five others are doing two, they double their efforts.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.300
That's all.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.540
And he's urging his followers living in the last days to be vigilant.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.139
The dare they are when the Lord's coming.

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:38.459
Do you cherish the privilege to preach and make disciples of Christ Jesus?

00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:45.540
Indeed, how eager we are to hear those words well done, good and faithful slave,

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:51.839
enter into the joy of your master.

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:56.720
The final talk of the program was given by Jeffrey Jackson of the governing body.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.160
It had the interesting topic who will soon attack God's people.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.759
Who really is God of May, God?

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:10.439
So when we look at the testimony here in the Scriptures, we can see that it's evident

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:19.879
that God of May, God does not refer to Satan the devil, but to a coalition of nations.

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:25.839
We know for sure that when God of May, God attacks, he is going to be defeated and then

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:29.160
destroyed completely.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.959
It had a wonderful spiritual banquet, but there was more to come.

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:40.160
Well, I'm very pleased to announce today the release of the pocket-size edition of the

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.680
revised English edition of the New World Translacent.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.360
The audience was further delighted to hear more good news.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:55.680
Many of you have been asking if we will be producing a new audio recording of the Bible

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.720
based on this new edition.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:05.839
Well, the answer is, yes, a Phoenician woman from that region came and cried out,

00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:13.720
have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David, my daughter is cruelly demon-possessed.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:19.279
Brothers Sanderson summed up the feelings of all involved, well, regardless of the challenges

00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:25.160
we each may have in our lives, when we're conscious of our blessings, when we take time

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:32.120
to meditate on them, when we take time to thank Jehovah for them, we are fortified, we

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.120
are strengthened.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:44.720
He also gave us the year text for 2015, Psalm 106.1, give thanks to Jehovah for He is good.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:52.079
All 19,129 enjoy this historic annual meeting.

00:07:52.079 --> 00:07:57.879
The final new song was sung together by both the Watchtower chorus and the audience, ending

00:07:57.879 --> 00:08:01.439
the 2014 annual meeting on a glorious note.
