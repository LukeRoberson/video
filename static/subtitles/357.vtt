00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:07.519
Let's open our Bibles, please, to Matthew, chapter 26, and we will begin at verse 36.

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:16.800
Matthew 26, verse 36, then Jesus came with them, his disciples to the spot called Gethsemane,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.440
and he said to his disciples, sit down here while I go over there to pray.

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:34.560
While I go over there to pray, the eternal future of all mankind rested on Jesus' shoulders.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:41.200
His remaining faithful to God was essential. He knew that if he did not remain faithful,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.520
it would be a slap in the face of Jehovah. It was prayer at this time in his life. That was the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:55.119
most important thing. Yes, I am perfect. I have supernatural powers. I can resurrect the dead.

00:00:55.119 --> 00:01:00.159
I can perform miracles. I'm the second greatest personage in the universe. I share in the creation.

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:07.200
But no, I'm not depending on that at this time. I'm not depending on supernatural powers and

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.599
natural abilities. I'm depending on my father. I'm leaning on him. It is prayer. It is

00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:21.040
supplication. That's what I'm depending on at this time. I need my father's help. If I'm going

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.359
to surrender my life today in a way that brings honor to him and remain as an integrity keeper,

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:35.280
I need to pray so I'm going over there to pray. The first valuable lesson we learned right here is

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.560
we work out our salvation today with fear and trembling. We're careful that over confidence does

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:50.159
not overtake us or just thinking that years of service or somehow past acts of loyalty would be

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.560
a license into the new world known. Now is the time to pray. Now is the time as we

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.719
come into the great tribulation. It's in the offing. Now is the time to take stock of ourselves.

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:08.960
And if we find ourselves running any yellow lights and we haven't gotten in an accident yet,

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:16.080
now is the time to put on the brakes. Now is the time to go over there and pray. Let's read verse

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:26.400
37. And taking along Peter and two sons of Zebedee, he began to feel grieved and greatly troubled

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:36.159
verse 38. And he said, I am deeply grieved even to death. This was no act. This was no show. Jesus

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:43.520
feelings were real. He was deeply grieved, greatly troubled, why? Because he knew his death as a

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:50.800
criminal on a on a stake that would be a reproach to his father, Jehovah God. That's what he was

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:57.120
concerned about blasphemy, his father being accused of cursing God. It was just too much of for him

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:05.680
to bear. This is what grieves him greatly, not himself and his reputation, but his father's name

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:13.360
and reputation. So again, think about the lesson that we learn. What is the most important thing in

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.879
our life? What do we deeply grieved about being misunderstood or not getting a particular

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:25.599
privilege and so forth? No, that's not what grieves us. What grieves us is Jehovah's name, bringing

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:31.759
reproach on that name. We want to do everything we can to honor that name. Here we are as the

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:37.919
United States Bethel family. And we owe it to Jehovah because of our privileges. What he has

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:45.759
allowed us to do to be here and to serve him, honoring his name, bringing no reproach, whether in

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:52.240
public or in private. That's our goal. We should feel deeply grieved and sorely troubled

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:59.199
in just the thought of bringing reproach upon Jehovah. And Jehovah is just as real to us as the

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:08.849
person sitting next to us. Now, let's read verse 39. And going a little way forward, he fell

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:20.610
down, he fell face down, praying. He falls face down, praying. Think of the intensity that he was

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:30.290
under face down, praying. Luke reports at this point, he got into an agony and he continued praying

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:40.740
more earnestly and his sweat became his drops of blood face down, praying face down. And his

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:46.899
sweat becoming drops of blood, he was keenly aware of the pain. What his father would go through

00:04:46.899 --> 00:04:52.819
is he would watch his beloved son put on a stake and treat it in such a barbaric fashion. He knew that

00:04:54.579 --> 00:05:01.060
no wonder, no wonder during his ministry when he's explaining to his disciples that he would have

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:09.540
to die. No wonder he reacted so strongly to Peter's words. When Peter said, be kind to yourself,

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:15.779
Lord, this isn't going to happen to you. Be kind to yourself. This isn't going to happen to you.

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:22.100
What? Be kind to myself. Here I am in this garden. My sweat has become as drops of blood and you're

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:28.899
telling me, be kind to myself. No wonder he said, get behind me Satan. What a strong rebuke

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:36.259
because in Jesus' mind, no, this is not a time to be kind to himself. Those were words that could

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:43.699
have caused a stumbling block. Now let's go further in verse 39. My father, if it is possible,

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:52.100
let this cup pass away from me. Let the cup, the cup of reproach, the cup of dishonoring your name.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:58.019
I can't handle that. Let it pass away. But Jehovah didn't. Jehovah said, no, this is the way I wanted

00:05:58.019 --> 00:06:07.620
to be. So Christ lined up his will along with Jehovah's will. And he knew Jehovah was hearing him.

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:14.420
He knew this supplication was ascending to the heavens. He knew because from his prehuman existence,

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:20.740
he watched his father answer prayers. He watched it. He saw evidence when he was the first born

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:26.019
there in the heavens with his father. He watched his father answer these supplications and pleadings

00:06:26.019 --> 00:06:31.860
of whether it be Hannah or Ruth or David. He saw that. So he knew my father is listening and will

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:40.339
answer this prayer. And he did. Because again, the gospel accounts at parallel this say that an

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:46.100
angel was sent to encourage Jesus at this time. What an encouragement that angel must have been

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:51.540
obviously Jesus would have known him from his prehuman existence. He gave reassuring words.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:55.459
You have your father's favor. He gave him fresh strength to continue

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:05.620
that night. And it is of interest that apparently that angel is able to tell Jesus that

00:07:06.579 --> 00:07:14.500
your death will not be a reproach on your father's name. In fact, your death is going to be the very

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:20.100
thing that Jehovah God uses to sanctify his name. So the very thing that was waiting,

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:27.699
a weighing on Jesus so much, Jehovah said, no, it won't reproach me. I'm going to use it to sanctify

00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:35.699
my name. So just think about how encouraged Jesus was of that. And the lesson for you and for me,

00:07:35.699 --> 00:07:46.339
again, another vital lesson. How do you know how Jehovah uses our acts of loyalty when we line up

00:07:46.339 --> 00:07:52.420
our will with his? And when it's not easy, we do what Jehovah asks us to do. These acts of loyalty

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:58.740
are piling up in its evidence that he can use against the devil to say, look, look, that is sanctifying

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:05.540
my name. That Bethelite is sanctifying me. That Bethelite and that Bethelite, you see, that's an honor

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:17.439
that we never want to forget. Finally, verse 46, get up. Let us go. My betrayer has drawn

00:08:17.439 --> 00:08:24.399
near. Get up. What did he mean by those words? Think of the power behind them. Get up. Let us go.

00:08:24.399 --> 00:08:30.240
The time for prayer is over. Now it's time for action. It's as if Jesus was saying, it's time to

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:38.159
rise from my knees and get up and go into the battle. Let me get up and be trade by Judas. Let me get

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:45.279
up and be subjected to an illegal trial. Let me get up and be put on that torture stake slab beaten

00:08:45.279 --> 00:08:52.559
and even nailed in an excruciating matter. It's time to do it. Let's do it. Get up. Let's go. We kneel

00:08:52.559 --> 00:09:00.480
before God so that we may stand erect to face our challenges. So what a powerful lesson that is

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:08.159
again for you and me. We pray. We pray. And then it's time to get up. We get up. Go to work. Get up.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:14.879
Go hit the publications. Get up. Go in the field service. In other words, we pray.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:20.879
And we get up and we follow through. Price Jesus proved faithful because of

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.960
supplication and prayer that he uttered to his father and made Jehovah give us the strength to do

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.960
the same.
