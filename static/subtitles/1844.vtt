00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.310
I was raised with three sisters and my nun was in the truth.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:16.559
I remember sitting on the sofa and just talking about spiritual things with my nun.

00:00:16.559 --> 00:00:23.559
And she taught us to appreciate any assignment that we had to see it as something very special.

00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:30.750
Pioneering was my life.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.750
Gilead to me was a way to give to others, to be very busy in service.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.750
I pray to Jehovah I said I really want to go to Gilead.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:48.750
But if it's possible to have a wife to an I just thought, boy are you pushy, you know?

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.750
And so, but Jehovah gave me that.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:00.030
I went to Gilead and to my amacement.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.030
This is the most lovely spiritual sister.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:16.030
Students in the same class, Lois, I met her and was able to marry her one week after Gilead.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:24.950
Arriving has a newlywed couple in a missionary home with seven other people.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:31.950
It was quite daunting, but we didn't let that phases, we were on a honeymoon.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.950
Columbia was a paradise spiritually.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.950
We loved it so much.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.950
This was the kind of life we wanted.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.200
Lois was a great teacher in the ministry.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:54.569
I always enjoyed working with her. She was actually a great support for me.

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:57.569
Obviously Columbia had its risks.

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:05.569
I remember in the mornings sometimes it got to the point where I would look at Lois and she would look at me and we'd just say,

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:08.569
but don't see in the paradise, you know.

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.419
Columbia became our home.

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:20.419
We traveled the length and breadth of the country in our different assignments.

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:28.419
We'd been over 20 years in Columbia when it became very evident that Lois's mom would need our care.

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:32.419
This of course would mean leaving our assignment.

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:38.990
It almost tore my heart apart to leave Columbia.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:49.259
I felt I was abandoning so many privileges and my treasured assignment.

00:02:49.259 --> 00:03:01.259
In the USA we were working as a team and I could see Lois really organized making the best of the situation.

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:10.259
Helping her mom was really the source in a way of her deep joy.

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:15.259
Helping others was just a way of life to Lois.

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:28.259
It doesn't matter what privilege you have, what responsibility, the true happiness is always found in giving.

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:34.020
Really, Lois got very ill.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.020
Lois never cried about her illness or felt sorry for herself.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:50.620
She always was focused on others and would give herself even within the pain of illness.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:58.620
Now that Lois has passed by many times, think of her example.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.870
It just motivates me to carry on.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:10.870
Here at the Central America branch, I am surrounded by such a loving family.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:24.870
I resolved when I went through this situation with losing my wife to find others that were in similar situations.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.870
Maybe sit down for a coffee.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:48.870
Just that fellow feeling, just being able to show interest and encourage another person is a great joy that I personally find one of the most helpful things to endure trials.
