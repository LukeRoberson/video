WEBVTT

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.530
Greetings, brothers and sisters.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:24.929
Welcome to this special edition of JW Broadcasting originating from the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:32.929
Our programs this month and next will feature the entire regional convention program for 2021.

00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:39.929
On behalf of the governing body and all the brothers and sisters working here at world headquarters,

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:43.929
it's my pleasure to welcome you to the convention.

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:50.929
This year's convention has the theme powerful by faith.

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:56.929
The theme scripture for today's program is Luke 17 verse 5.

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:59.929
Give us more faith.

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:03.929
We begin this first session with a music video presentation.

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:09.930
As you watch the video, notice how Jehovah's people show faith by reaching out in his service

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.930
and how parents can help their children to build faith.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.930
Please enjoy the presentation.

00:09:51.679 --> 00:10:30.639
We are delighted that you could join us for this opening session of the powerful by faith convention of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:10:30.639 --> 00:10:36.639
Let's sing together song number 5 entitled God's wondrous works.

00:10:36.639 --> 00:13:09.429
Again, that song number 5.

00:13:09.429 --> 00:13:13.429
What is faith and why is it essential for us to have it?

00:13:13.429 --> 00:13:20.429
Brother Mark Sanderson, a member of the governing body of Jehovah's Witnesses will answer these questions in the talk.

00:13:20.429 --> 00:13:29.610
How powerful is faith?

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:38.610
Dear brothers and sisters, welcome to this 2021 powerful by faith convention of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:48.610
And let me begin by extending to all of you the warm Christian love and greetings from the governing body and the United States Bethel family.

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:54.610
And let me assure you that we continue to pray on your behalf.

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:57.610
Powerful by faith.

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:02.610
What a motivating, what an encouraging theme for this convention.

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:05.610
What are we going to learn?

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:10.610
Well, we're going to concentrate on answering three questions at this convention.

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:14.610
The first one is, what is faith?

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:19.610
The second one is, what can faith do for us?

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:24.610
And the third is, how can we build our faith?

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:33.610
Well, it's appropriate since this is the introduction to the convention for us to spend some time talking about each one of those questions.

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:38.610
So let's begin with that first question. What is faith?

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:45.610
Now, brothers and sisters, we know that faith is something that is produced in us by God's Holy Spirit.

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:52.610
In fact, Galatians chapter 5 says that faith is a part of the fruitage of God's Holy Spirit.

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:56.610
So if we have God's Spirit, we will have faith.

00:14:56.610 --> 00:15:00.610
But what exactly is faith?

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:07.610
Well, let's go in our Bibles. Let's see the definition the Bible gives in Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 1.

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:09.610
Did you read it with me?

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:12.610
Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 1 says,

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:23.610
Faith is the assured expectation of what is hoped for, the evident demonstration of realities that are not seen.

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:28.610
Now you'll notice the definition of faith is given in two parts.

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:30.610
What is the first part?

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:37.610
Well, first it says, faith is the assured expectation of what is hoped for.

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:39.610
Well, what does that mean?

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:46.610
Well, faith is the conviction that we will have the things that we hope for.

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:48.610
Maybe we can illustrate it this way.

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:54.610
You know, it's like the conviction we have when we go to bed at night that the sun is going to rise in the morning.

00:15:54.610 --> 00:16:02.610
It's the conviction that the farmer has when he saw his seed that those seeds are going to sprout and they're going to grow.

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:11.610
Faith makes future things promised by God as real as if we already have them now.

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:20.610
That means that the person with faith firmly believes that everything that Jehovah says is true

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:28.610
and that all of the promises that Jehovah has made are going to come to reality.

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:31.610
But now what's the second part of that definition?

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:38.610
Faith is the evident demonstration of realities that are not seen.

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:40.610
What does that mean?

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:45.610
Well, maybe we could illustrate it with something simple like this cell phone.

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:54.610
Now, if you have a cell phone and you have cell phone service, then wherever you may be on the earth, I could call you right now.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:57.610
But now, there are no wires attached to this phone.

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:00.610
How could that possibly work?

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:05.609
Well, of course, we know that this technology relies on radio waves.

00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:08.609
Now, you and I can't see radio waves.

00:17:08.609 --> 00:17:22.609
But every time we make a call on our cell phones, we see the evidence or the evident demonstration that radio waves are real, even though we cannot see them.

00:17:22.609 --> 00:17:24.609
What's the point?

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:36.609
If we really have faith, it means that we can believe in something that is verified by strong evidence even though it is unseen.

00:17:36.609 --> 00:17:42.609
Well, that means that faith, as described in the Bible, is not unquestioning.

00:17:42.609 --> 00:17:46.609
It is not irrational. It is not foolish or gullible.

00:17:46.609 --> 00:17:51.609
It's not being quick to believe something with little or no evidence.

00:17:51.609 --> 00:18:01.609
True faith comes from a careful analysis and study of God's precious word, the Bible.

00:18:01.609 --> 00:18:07.609
The accurate knowledge that we gain from God's word helps us to build our faith.

00:18:07.609 --> 00:18:11.609
It's there in the Bible that we learn about God.

00:18:11.609 --> 00:18:13.609
We learn about His name.

00:18:13.609 --> 00:18:17.609
We learn about His promises that have already come true.

00:18:17.609 --> 00:18:23.609
And we learn about promises that He's made exciting promises for our future.

00:18:23.609 --> 00:18:28.609
But faith is also built and established by something else. What is that?

00:18:28.609 --> 00:18:30.609
Well, it's the creation.

00:18:30.609 --> 00:18:38.609
When we look up into the night sky and we see the exact order in the universe, how does it make us feel?

00:18:38.609 --> 00:18:50.609
Or when we look at the human brain and its complexity or the complexity of the human eye, we have to come to the conclusion that there must be a designer.

00:18:50.609 --> 00:18:56.609
There is strong evidence for an intelligent creator.

00:18:56.609 --> 00:19:04.609
Well, now, why is it so important that you and I grow in our faith and develop faith?

00:19:04.609 --> 00:19:06.609
Well, the Bible answers that question too.

00:19:06.609 --> 00:19:11.609
Would you look with me at Hebrews 11 and verse 6?

00:19:11.609 --> 00:19:14.609
Hebrews 11 and 6. It says,

00:19:14.609 --> 00:19:22.609
Moreover, without faith, it is impossible. Isn't that interesting? It is impossible to please God well.

00:19:22.609 --> 00:19:32.609
For whoever approaches God must believe that He is and that He becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking Him.

00:19:32.609 --> 00:19:38.609
Well, did you see the point? Without faith, it is impossible to please God.

00:19:38.609 --> 00:19:44.609
So faith is essential if we are going to please God and have His blessing.

00:19:44.609 --> 00:19:51.609
Well, we've talked quite a bit about what faith is, but here are two things that faith is not.

00:19:51.609 --> 00:20:01.609
Faith is not simply believing that God exists because the Bible says even the demons believe in God, but they shudder.

00:20:01.609 --> 00:20:11.609
It involves coming to know Jehovah, coming to trust Him, forming an unbreakable friendship with Him,

00:20:11.609 --> 00:20:21.609
so that Jehovah is so real to us that we sense His love and sense His approval in our day-to-day life.

00:20:21.609 --> 00:20:28.609
What's the other thing that faith is not? Faith is not simply hoping for something.

00:20:28.609 --> 00:20:37.609
The Bible uses the example of Abraham. Now, Abraham had the demonstration of the things that he hoped for.

00:20:37.609 --> 00:20:43.609
He had evidence that God was real, but how did that affect Abraham? What was the result?

00:20:43.609 --> 00:20:51.609
Let's read together this important scripture, Romans chapter 4 and verse 20.

00:20:52.609 --> 00:21:04.609
Romans chapter 4 and verse 20. It says, but because of the promise of God, he, that is Abraham, did not waver in a lack of faith.

00:21:04.609 --> 00:21:12.609
But notice what did he do? He became powerful by faith, giving God glory.

00:21:12.609 --> 00:21:23.609
You see, Abraham was moved. He was motivated. He was empowered. He became powerful by His faith.

00:21:23.609 --> 00:21:34.609
Well, how appropriately then, that Romans chapter 4 and verse 20 has been chosen as the theme text for this convention.

00:21:34.609 --> 00:21:43.609
Now, in a moment, we are going to talk about the power of faith. But before we do, we have a wonderful treat now.

00:21:43.609 --> 00:21:50.609
Please give your attention to a recorded message from our dear brother, Jeffrey Jackson of the governing body,

00:21:50.609 --> 00:21:55.609
as he explains to us how important faith is for Christians today.

00:21:55.609 --> 00:22:13.839
Welcome to the powerful by faith convention of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:22:13.839 --> 00:22:19.839
You'll certainly be happy that you made the effort to attend all three days of this convention.

00:22:19.839 --> 00:22:29.839
The expression, powerful by faith, is drawn from the Apostle Paul's words at Romans chapter 4 and verse 20.

00:22:29.839 --> 00:22:35.839
Why did the governing body choose faith as the theme for this year's convention?

00:22:35.839 --> 00:22:44.839
Because we need strong faith to deal successfully with our present trials and with those we'll face in the near future.

00:22:44.839 --> 00:22:52.839
At Matthew chapter 17 and verse 20, Jesus assured His disciples.

00:22:52.839 --> 00:22:59.839
If you have faith, the size of a mustard grain, you will say to this mountain,

00:22:59.839 --> 00:23:07.839
move from here to there, and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.

00:23:07.839 --> 00:23:14.839
Yes, faith enables us to do things we could never imagine doing on our own.

00:23:14.839 --> 00:23:22.839
For Christians, faith is essential. In fact, God commands us to have faith.

00:23:22.839 --> 00:23:27.839
At first John chapter 3 and verse 23, we read,

00:23:27.839 --> 00:23:35.839
Indeed, this is His commandment, that we have faith in the name of His Son, Jesus Christ,

00:23:35.839 --> 00:23:41.839
and love one another, just as He gave us a commandment.

00:23:41.839 --> 00:23:46.839
And Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 6 tells us,

00:23:46.839 --> 00:23:51.839
Without faith, it is impossible to police God well.

00:23:51.839 --> 00:24:01.839
For whoever approaches God must believe that He is, and that He becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking Him.

00:24:01.839 --> 00:24:13.839
Clearly, to receive Jehovah's blessing and gain the reward of everlasting life, we need to build and maintain faith.

00:24:13.839 --> 00:24:20.839
At Romans chapter 1 verse 17, quoting the prophet Habakkuk, Paul wrote,

00:24:20.839 --> 00:24:25.839
The righteous one will live by reason of faith.

00:24:25.839 --> 00:24:33.839
With these words, Paul emphasized that Jehovah will reward all who show real faith.

00:24:33.839 --> 00:24:42.839
Based on our faith in Jesus' ransom, Jehovah forgives our sins and grants us a righteous standing with Him even now.

00:24:43.839 --> 00:24:52.839
And during Armageddon, Jehovah will protect God's people and then give them the opportunity to live forever in paradise.

00:24:52.839 --> 00:24:55.839
That's what we want for all of you.

00:24:55.839 --> 00:25:00.839
Most of us here today already have a large measure of faith.

00:25:00.839 --> 00:25:06.839
And as Paul wrote, at 2 Corinthians chapter 1 and verse 24,

00:25:06.839 --> 00:25:11.839
It is by your faith that you are standing.

00:25:11.839 --> 00:25:22.839
Reports from around the globe testify to your genuine faith and the good that Jehovah is accomplishing through you because of your faith.

00:25:22.839 --> 00:25:29.839
We feel as Paul expressed a Colossians chapter 1 and verses 3 and 4.

00:25:29.839 --> 00:25:36.839
We always thank God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ when we pray for you,

00:25:36.839 --> 00:25:44.839
since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and the love you have for all the holy ones.

00:25:44.839 --> 00:25:55.839
But constant pressure from Satan and the demons, the old world and our own imperfections, can weaken and wear down our faith.

00:25:55.839 --> 00:26:01.839
The purpose of this convention is to strengthen that faith.

00:26:01.839 --> 00:26:11.839
We'll learn how to cultivate true faith, how to exercise it in our daily lives and how to maintain it during difficult times.

00:26:11.839 --> 00:26:21.839
So please pay close attention to each part of the program, as scriptures are read, follow along in the Bible.

00:26:21.839 --> 00:26:28.839
And may God's Word empower you to be a man, woman or child of faith.

00:26:28.839 --> 00:26:34.210
Thank you so much, Brother Jackson.

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:37.210
Well, let's come back now to the point we were discussing.

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:41.210
What is the power of faith?

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:51.210
Well, now to open this discussion, let's open our Bibles and let's go to Matthew chapter 17 and let's read together verses 19 and 20.

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:56.210
That's Matthew 17 verses 19 and 20.

00:26:56.210 --> 00:27:00.210
Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said,

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:03.210
Why could we not expel it?

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:10.210
He said to them, Because of your little faith, for truly I say to you,

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:17.210
If you have the faith, the size of a mustard grain, you will say to this mountain,

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:27.210
Move from here to there and it will move and nothing will be impossible for you.

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:32.210
Wow, Jesus said that faith is powerful.

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:36.210
He said nothing will be impossible for you.

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:43.210
Well, just as Peter, because of his faith, was able to get out of the boat and walk on the water,

00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:52.210
Our faith can enable us to do things that from a human perspective seemed to be completely impossible.

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:56.210
Let's consider six different things.

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:58.210
Here's the first one.

00:27:58.210 --> 00:28:07.210
Faith opens up the privilege of being able to walk with our wonderful amazing God, Jehovah.

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:10.210
Well, now what does that mean?

00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:15.210
Well, the Bible says men of faith like Noah walked with the true God.

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:18.210
But what does it mean when it says that?

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:25.210
Well, Noah followed Jehovah's commandments and instructions so carefully,

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:36.210
and Noah loved Jehovah so much that it was just as though Noah and Jehovah were walking down the street together

00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:40.210
as the closest and most intimate of friends.

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:45.210
That is something that faith made possible for Noah.

00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:50.210
But brothers and sisters, here's the really wonderful and amazing thing.

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:57.210
That was true for Noah, but it's also true for you, and it's also true for me.

00:28:57.210 --> 00:29:06.210
We too can experience what seems impossible to be actually walking with our Heavenly Father day by day.

00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:09.210
That is the power of faith.

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:12.210
Let's look at a second one.

00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:18.210
Faith moves us to obey the commands of God without hesitation.

00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:21.210
Now, as an example, we think of Abraham.

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:26.210
He's called in the Scriptures the Father of all those having faith.

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:29.210
Now, how is Abraham an example?

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:36.210
Well, he was quick to obey Jehovah even when Jehovah asked him to do things that were very difficult,

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:41.210
like leaving earth and offering up his only son.

00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:46.210
Abraham was willing to obey because of his faith.

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:48.210
But now, brothers, think.

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:52.210
Think about what this makes possible today.

00:29:53.210 --> 00:30:01.210
People who have been addicted to drugs, to tobacco, to alcohol, to gambling, to pornography,

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:09.210
people who have been living immoral lifestyles of all sorts, people who said they would never be able to give up those habits.

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:14.210
They would never be able to change their lifestyle, but what happened?

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:20.210
As they developed faith through their faith, through their desire to please Jehovah,

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:25.210
they broke free from all of those things.

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:27.210
We have seen people like that.

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:28.210
You have seen them.

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:29.210
I have seen them.

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:37.210
We know that people like this have conquered all of these bad things because of their faith.

00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:41.210
Maybe you are one of those people.

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:46.210
Brothers and sisters, that is the real power of faith.

00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:57.210
Not something theoretical, not something imagined, but in action, people experience that power in their own lives.

00:30:57.210 --> 00:31:00.210
Let's go to the third one.

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:08.210
Faith in the fulfillment of Jehovah's promises moves us to want to go out and preach the good news of God's kingdom.

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:17.210
Now let's read what the Scriptures say about this in 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and verse 13.

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:19.210
It says there,

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:25.210
Now because we have the same spirit of faith, as that of which it is written,

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:35.210
I exercised faith, therefore I spoke, we too exercised faith, and therefore we speak.

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:37.210
Well, what does it mean?

00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:45.210
Without faith, without exercising faith in the promises of God, we would never ever be able to do the preaching work.

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:53.210
In fact, maybe when you were first studying the Bible with Jehovah's Witnesses, maybe you said something like this.

00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:56.210
I'll never go from door to door.

00:31:56.210 --> 00:32:00.210
You'll never see me walking down the street, knocking on doors.

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:02.210
But what happened?

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:07.210
As you grew in your faith, you wanted to share the things that you were learning.

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:13.210
You wanted to talk about all the wonderful things that you were hearing about Jehovah.

00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:16.210
Yes, faith helps us conquer our fears.

00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:18.210
It helps us overcome shyness.

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:22.210
It helps us overcome indifference in the territory.

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:27.210
It helps us overcome opposition or even government bans.

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:38.210
Hitler, Stalin, the Soviet Union, and even Russia today, all of them have said that they would crush Jehovah's Witnesses

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:42.210
and they would put an end to our preaching.

00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:44.210
But what happened?

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:51.210
Our brothers and sisters kept on preaching, despite whatever opposition came.

00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:58.210
And our brothers today, living under similar circumstances under ban, continue preaching also.

00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:01.210
They do not give up.

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:02.210
Why?

00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:08.210
Why are they able to keep going because of the power of faith?

00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:17.210
Faith moves them to action and to continue telling the good news no matter what the circumstances may be.

00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:20.210
Let's go on to the fourth point.

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:26.210
Our faith moves us to act in ways that bring blessings to us.

00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:28.210
Now, think about this.

00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:35.210
Some people who saw and heard the teaching of Jesus and His works, they put faith in Him.

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:40.210
They believed that Jesus was able to heal them.

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:45.210
And so, that faith led to blessings, well in what way?

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:49.210
Well, sometimes when Jesus healed individuals, what did He say?

00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:53.210
He said, your faith has made you well.

00:33:53.210 --> 00:34:00.210
In other words, if those people had not exercised faith in Jesus, they would not have come to Him

00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:05.210
and they would never have experienced the healing that He gave them.

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:07.210
What's the point?

00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:14.210
Today, we are not looking to be physically healed through our faith in Jesus.

00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:24.210
But many of us have made major decisions, made major changes in our lives in order to become disciples of Christ.

00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:33.210
Perhaps we left promising careers, perhaps we left fame, perhaps we gave up higher education or whatever it may be.

00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:41.210
But what is the promise that Jesus made to all of us who have made these decisions based on faith?

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:47.210
In Mark chapter 10 and verse 29, look what Jesus said.

00:34:47.210 --> 00:35:01.210
No one has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for my sake and for the sake of the good news,

00:35:01.210 --> 00:35:16.210
who will not get 100 times more now in this period of time, houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields

00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:22.210
with persecution and in the coming system of things, everlasting life.

00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:23.210
What's the point?

00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:25.210
You see, we've made these decisions.

00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:35.210
We may have walked away from many things in the world, but by putting faith in Christ Jesus, what amazing blessings have come to us.

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:41.210
Just like Jesus said, 100 times more than what we have given up.

00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:44.210
That is the power of faith.

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:47.210
Let's look at number five.

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:54.210
Faith helps us to win our struggle against the superhuman spirit forces.

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:56.210
Well now, how so?

00:35:56.210 --> 00:36:08.710
Let's read together Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 16, Ephesians 6 and verse 16.

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:15.710
It says,

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:22.710
With which you will be able to extinguish all the wicked ones burning arrows.

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:25.710
Well now, what is the point?

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:31.710
Did you notice that here in Ephesians 6 faith is compared to a large shield?

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:36.710
Just like a large shield that covers most of the body.

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:44.710
Faith in Jehovah God and His promises for the future can shield us from what does it say in verse 16?

00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:49.710
From all the wicked ones burning arrows.

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:52.710
We can be completely protected.

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:54.710
Well, what does that mean?

00:36:55.710 --> 00:37:01.710
It means that through our faith we have the power to get up and turn off that television.

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:06.710
We have the power to walk out of that movie theater.

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:15.710
We have the power to unplug that computer, if necessary, to get rid of those temptations or bad ideas

00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:19.710
that could motivate us to enter into a course of wrong.

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:27.710
It is no wonder that first Thessalonians chapter 5 and verse 8 compares faith to a breastplate

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:34.710
that can protect our figurative heart from temptation and from the power of sin.

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:37.710
That is real power.

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:40.710
But now let's go to our sixth point.

00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:47.710
Faith moves us to trust that our prayers to Jehovah God are heard

00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:53.710
and that Jehovah will answer them if they are in harmony with His will.

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:55.710
This is what Jesus said.

00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:57.710
Will you read it with me?

00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:02.710
It's Mark chapter 11 and verse 24.

00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:13.710
Jesus said, this is why I tell you all the things you pray and ask for have faith that you have received them

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:17.710
and you will have them.

00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:24.710
Well now brothers, when we have that faith that the things we are asking Jehovah he's hearing us,

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:29.710
he's listening to us, especially during these troubled times in the midst of this pandemic,

00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:37.710
when we have many anxieties and concerns, how wonderful that we can believe that Jehovah God is hearing us

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:45.710
and that he's going to provide an answer to us just exactly in harmony with what we need.

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:55.710
So after considering these six different factors, wouldn't you agree with me that faith is powerful?

00:38:55.710 --> 00:39:06.710
It has real power to make things that seem impossible to men become realities for those who have faith in Jehovah.

00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:16.710
Well how thankful we can be that Jehovah is helping us to develop this wonderful quality through solid evidence,

00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:22.710
through accurate knowledge and through His precious Holy Spirit.

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:26.710
Well that brings us to that third question.

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:34.710
How can we build up our faith and maybe more specifically, how is this convention going to help us to build our faith?

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:43.710
Well of course the convention is going to include many talks, symposiums, interviews, we're going to have a two-part Bible drama,

00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:46.710
so there is much to look forward to.

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:53.710
But maybe just for a few minutes, would you open up your program, perhaps on your device like I'm using here today,

00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:59.710
and let's consider some of the highlights that we can expect to see in our convention.

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:06.710
So you'll notice on day one, the theme for the day is from Luke chapter 17 and verse 5,

00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:09.710
give us more faith.

00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:13.710
Would you like to strengthen your relationship with Jehovah?

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:17.710
Well pay attention to the dramatic Bible reading.

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:24.710
That's where we're going to learn about how faith moved Noah to be able to obey Jehovah,

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:32.710
even though the things Jehovah asked of him were very, very large, take notice of that audio drama.

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:37.710
And then in the afternoon, are you a person that loves Jehovah's creation?

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:43.710
Well the second symposium of our convention, use creation to build your faith,

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:52.710
is going to show us how Jehovah's love, His wisdom and His power are reflected in all the beautiful things that He made.

00:40:52.710 --> 00:41:01.710
And it's going to show us also that Jehovah not only has the ability, but the desire to fulfill His promises for the future.

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:03.710
And then how about this?

00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:06.710
How strong is your faith?

00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:09.710
Well take notice of the final talk on Friday afternoon.

00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:16.710
That's where we're going to hear the talk, keep testing whether you are in the faith, how?

00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:22.710
That'll give us an opportunity to look at our own faith and see just how strong it is.

00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:25.710
Let's go to day two.

00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:32.710
There we see that the theme for the day is going to be Jude 3, put up a hard fight for the faith.

00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:38.710
Have you begun to use our new study publication, Enjoy Life Forever?

00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:45.710
Well we'll all want to listen carefully to the talk, Build Faith Using Enjoy Life Forever.

00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:57.710
That's going to discuss how we can use this new study publication to reach the heart of our student, but also to help our student to build faith.

00:41:57.710 --> 00:42:03.710
Within Jehovah's organization, we have many brothers and sisters who have unbelieving mates.

00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:10.710
We have many who are part of single parent families, and we have many who are single.

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:20.710
The symposium entitled Fighters Successful Fighters for the Faith is going to show us what we can learn from these faithful Christians.

00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:22.710
Take note.

00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:31.710
And then looking in the afternoon, although we can't travel right now, we're going to have the opportunity to go on around the world tour.

00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:44.710
Because the video how our brothers are showing faith is going to take us all around the world and show us how our brothers are manifesting faith in many, many different parts of this beautiful earth.

00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:55.710
And then you are all in for an amazing treat with part one of the Bible drama, Daniel, a lifetime of faith.

00:42:55.710 --> 00:43:07.710
Now, I think I can say confidently that this is absolutely the best drama that we have ever produced. You are going to love it.

00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:15.710
Well, the last talk on day two is a serious one. It's going to contrast faith destroyers with faith builders.

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:23.710
And it's going to show us how we can strengthen our trust in Jehovah's Word and also in his organization.

00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:32.710
Well, finally day three, our theme is going to be Matthew 21, 21. If you have faith, it will happen.

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:38.710
We're going to look at what we can learn from faithful women of God.

00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:50.710
You'll notice there's an eight-part symposium that shows us how the women featured in each talk showed faith, but also how we can imitate their faith.

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:58.710
And then in the afternoon, we have the thrilling finale of that Bible drama, Daniel, a lifetime of faith.

00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:10.710
And finally, then, the convention will conclude all too soon with the very motivating and moving talk, become powerful by your faith.

00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:17.710
Well, brothers, would you like to see just a taste of what's in store in some of the videos we're going to be seeing? Let's watch.

00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:29.820
I could tell from the doctor's voice the news wasn't good. I just didn't expect my health to worsen so quickly.

00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:40.460
If a gun is what I need to protect my family, won't Jehovah understand?

00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:47.460
I knew how mom felt about the holidays, but I also learned how Jehovah felt.

00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:56.869
It was as if a veil had been lifted from my eyes. That was the moment Jehovah introduced himself to me.

00:44:56.869 --> 00:45:09.780
In my darkest times, Jehovah's words brought me comfort.

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:13.780
I knew these words would build my faith.

00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:17.780
Trust in Jehovah and do what is good.

00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:25.210
Well, doesn't that wet your appetite for when is coming at this convention?

00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:33.210
Now, keep in mind some of the videos at the convention present real accounts, but many others are just dramatizations.

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:35.210
Now, what does that mean?

00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:45.210
Well, the dramatizations don't portray real people or real events, but they depict situations that help to teach us the truth.

00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:54.210
Jehovah God loves and appreciates men and women of faith, men and women just like you.

00:45:54.210 --> 00:46:00.210
He is determined to reward men and women like that with an amazing reward.

00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:05.210
Would you read it with me? Let's look at John chapter 6 and verse 40.

00:46:05.210 --> 00:46:09.210
John chapter 6 and verse 40, it says,

00:46:10.210 --> 00:46:26.210
For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who recognizes the Son and exercises faith in Him should have ever lasting life, and I will resurrect Him on the last day.

00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:32.210
Those exercising faith can be certain of receiving this reward.

00:46:32.210 --> 00:46:35.210
John chapter 3, verse 36, Jesus said,

00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:43.210
The one who exercises faith in the Son has, has ever lasting life.

00:46:43.210 --> 00:46:53.210
So, dear brothers and sisters, as we begin this wonderful convention, please be determined to take notes,

00:46:53.210 --> 00:47:04.210
be determined to meditate on the things that you will hear so that you may cultivate, maintain and strengthen your faith.

00:47:04.210 --> 00:47:17.809
If you do, you too will become powerful by faith and receive the wonderful amazing reward of ever lasting life.

00:47:17.809 --> 00:47:22.809
Thank you, brothers and sisters, for laying a foundation for the program parts to follow.

00:47:22.809 --> 00:47:28.809
We are confident that each session will help us strengthen our faith.

00:47:28.809 --> 00:47:38.809
Real faith is based on evidence. In the first symposium of this convention, we will examine evidence that provides a basis for our faith.

00:47:38.809 --> 00:47:50.809
Brother David Chaffer, a helper to the teaching committee of the governing body, will begin with a talk, why we have faith in God's existence.

00:47:50.809 --> 00:48:00.369
Each speaker will then introduce the one to follow.

00:48:00.369 --> 00:48:04.369
Does something exist because you believe it does?

00:48:04.369 --> 00:48:09.369
Does something not exist simply because you don't believe in it?

00:48:09.369 --> 00:48:18.369
No, truth is based on evidence, but what kind of evidence convinces you that something exists?

00:48:18.369 --> 00:48:25.369
We believe in many things we can't see, air, wind, atoms, electricity, gravity, time.

00:48:25.369 --> 00:48:32.369
And we believe in things we can't hear, galaxies, dog whistles, microorganisms.

00:48:32.369 --> 00:48:39.369
We also believe in things we can't feel, such as our brain or the rotation of the earth.

00:48:39.369 --> 00:48:43.369
But why? What convinces you?

00:48:43.369 --> 00:48:51.369
The effects. Effects that you can see, hear, feel, and measure.

00:48:51.369 --> 00:49:00.369
And the testimony from those who know the facts. Evidence. Evidence is the basis for faith.

00:49:00.369 --> 00:49:10.369
Today, many people don't believe that God exists. Their lack of faith can affect us. Indeed, our faith is under attack.

00:49:10.369 --> 00:49:17.369
This symposium will remind us of our reasons for faith and will help us to strengthen our faith.

00:49:17.369 --> 00:49:28.369
We'll consider why we have faith in God's existence, in His Word, in His moral standards, and in His love.

00:49:28.369 --> 00:49:33.369
First, why is faith in God's existence important?

00:49:33.369 --> 00:49:37.369
Please find Ephesians 2.

00:49:37.369 --> 00:49:45.369
And notice how the Apostle Paul describes Christians in Ephesus before they knew the true God.

00:49:45.369 --> 00:49:50.369
Ephesians 2 and verse 1 reads,

00:49:50.369 --> 00:49:58.369
Furthermore, God made you alive, though you were dead in your trespasses and sins.

00:49:58.369 --> 00:50:00.369
And verse 12 continues,

00:50:00.369 --> 00:50:07.369
At that time, you were without Christ, alienated from the state of Israel,

00:50:07.369 --> 00:50:16.369
strangers to the covenants of the promise you had no hope, and were without God in the world.

00:50:16.369 --> 00:50:25.369
The same was true for us, but faith in the existence of the Creator has given our lives meaning and purpose.

00:50:25.369 --> 00:50:33.369
It has unlocked the answers to such questions as, why does the universe exist and what does the future hold?

00:50:33.369 --> 00:50:39.369
True, there are people who shy away from such questions, thinking that the answers are just beyond us.

00:50:39.369 --> 00:50:44.369
Some even teach that there is no purpose, no ultimate meaning in life.

00:50:44.369 --> 00:50:49.369
But where does that leave them without reliable guidance?

00:50:49.369 --> 00:50:57.369
In contrast, notice what Psalm 11110 teaches us about the effect of our faith.

00:50:57.369 --> 00:51:02.369
Psalm 111 verse 10 says,

00:51:02.369 --> 00:51:08.369
The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom.

00:51:08.369 --> 00:51:16.369
All those observing His orders show good insight, His praise, indoors forever.

00:51:16.369 --> 00:51:27.369
Yes, clear thinking and practical application of knowledge begin with regarding the Creator with awe and profound respect.

00:51:27.369 --> 00:51:32.369
And as indicated in the very next verse, this makes us happier people.

00:51:32.369 --> 00:51:42.369
That's why we need to safeguard our faith. It's the foundation for our relationship with God, the basis for our hope, the key to our future.

00:51:42.369 --> 00:51:49.369
So let's remind ourselves why we can have faith in God's existence.

00:51:49.369 --> 00:51:55.369
Let's go back to the chapter of the Bible that defines faith. Hebrews chapter 11.

00:51:55.369 --> 00:52:06.369
Hebrews 111 tells us that faith is the convincing evidence of realities that are not seen.

00:52:06.369 --> 00:52:10.369
But now what would be an example of that?

00:52:10.369 --> 00:52:13.369
Let's read together Hebrews 113.

00:52:15.969 --> 00:52:33.969
It says, by faith, we perceive that the systems of things were put in order by God's word so that what is seen has come into existence from things that are not visible, the systems of things.

00:52:33.969 --> 00:52:37.969
What might be some of those systems?

00:52:37.969 --> 00:52:47.969
Let's include our solar system and the galactic system that it's a part of and the smaller cycles that occur within our solar system.

00:52:47.969 --> 00:52:57.969
Think about our Earth's atmosphere which protects us from the sun's harmful rays while at the same time allowing the entry of essential heat and light.

00:52:57.969 --> 00:53:03.969
Just think what would happen to us were it not for our atmosphere's protective shield.

00:53:03.969 --> 00:53:16.969
Turn up in seconds and besides a blocking out harmful rays that the atmosphere along with Earth's magnetic field also absorbs much of the debris that flies through space.

00:53:16.969 --> 00:53:24.969
By faith, we perceive that these systems were put in order by God's word.

00:53:24.969 --> 00:53:27.969
Or think about the Earth's amazing cycles.

00:53:27.969 --> 00:53:39.969
Imagine what would happen if a city's water supply, its fresh air, its water were disrupted and the sewers were blocked.

00:53:39.969 --> 00:53:42.969
What would be the quality of life in that city?

00:53:42.969 --> 00:53:53.969
And yet our planet is a closed system, clean air and water are not shipped in from outer space, waste matter is not rocketed out.

00:53:53.969 --> 00:53:58.969
So how does the Earth remain healthy and habitable?

00:53:58.969 --> 00:54:09.969
The water cycle, the carbon and oxygen cycles, and the nitrogen cycle all tuned precisely to sustain life.

00:54:09.969 --> 00:54:32.969
Of course, this doesn't mean that we can be careless stewards of our planet, but what remarkable systems and much more could be said about the Earth's perfect location in our solar system or about the planet's perfect orbit tilt rotational speed and unusual moon or about our solar system's perfect position in the Milky Way.

00:54:32.969 --> 00:54:42.969
Are all of these precise locations and elegant measurements the result of blind chance or of purposeful design?

00:54:42.969 --> 00:54:53.969
As you watch the following video, note yet another example of how the order evident in creation clearly points to an all wise creator.

00:54:53.969 --> 00:55:00.940
Our bodies are made up of trillions of cells.

00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:09.190
Yet each individual cell is a marvel of design and organization.

00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:20.190
Inside our cells, biological processes signal specific proteins to assemble themselves into tracks called microtubules.

00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:32.500
Tiny molecular machines called kinesens then transport various components to different parts of the cell by walking along the tracks.

00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:51.099
From microscopic proteins to enormous galaxies, our organized universe abounds with examples of elegant design.

00:55:51.099 --> 00:56:05.119
How can you strengthen your faith in God's existence? Consider three things that we can do.

00:56:05.119 --> 00:56:09.119
Please open your Bibles to Romans chapter 1.

00:56:09.119 --> 00:56:22.119
When we consider examples like these of God's power and wisdom, it doesn't make us wonder how could anyone deny the evidence of an intelligent and loving designer.

00:56:22.119 --> 00:56:30.119
Romans 118 indicates that such denial requires suppressing the truth. Why?

00:56:30.119 --> 00:56:35.119
Well, notice what it says at Romans 119.

00:56:35.119 --> 00:56:47.119
Because what may be known about God is clearly evident, clearly evident among them.

00:56:47.119 --> 00:56:59.119
For God made it clear to them. Verse 20 says, for his invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world's creation onward because they are perceived by the things made.

00:56:59.119 --> 00:57:09.119
Even his eternal power and Godship so that they, namely those who suppress the truth, are inexcusable.

00:57:09.119 --> 00:57:17.119
God's existence and his qualities were apparent the moment mankind first appeared on earth.

00:57:17.119 --> 00:57:26.119
And the evidence has only become clearer with the passage of time and the advancement of technology that enables us to discover what God has done.

00:57:26.119 --> 00:57:36.119
So that's the first way that we strengthen our faith in God's existence through study and meditation, meditating on the evidence.

00:57:36.119 --> 00:57:50.119
And to help us with this, we find an abundance of published material about creation on JW.org where we find brochures, articles in the series, was it designed and interviews with scientists.

00:57:50.119 --> 00:57:57.119
The second way that we strengthen our faith is by earnestly praying for more faith.

00:57:57.119 --> 00:58:03.119
Jesus said as recorded at Luke 1113 that God will give his Holy Spirit to those asking him for it.

00:58:03.119 --> 00:58:07.119
And part of that Spirit's fruitage is faith.

00:58:07.119 --> 00:58:12.119
Third, we strengthen our faith by building the faith of others.

00:58:12.119 --> 00:58:17.119
How? By drawing attention to the evidence that supports the truth.

00:58:17.119 --> 00:58:24.119
Parents patiently build the faith of your children. If they have doubts, address them promptly, kindly, calmly.

00:58:24.119 --> 00:58:27.119
Don't dismiss their questions and don't get upset.

00:58:27.119 --> 00:58:31.119
Be glad they ask that shows they care and they want to understand.

00:58:31.119 --> 00:58:41.119
Accept the challenge, present the evidence, look for it together when you sit in your house, when you walk on the road, when you lie down, and when you get up.

00:58:41.119 --> 00:58:48.119
In the following video, note what strengthens the faith of one of our brothers who is a scientist.

00:58:48.119 --> 00:58:55.690
As a mechanical design educator, I view even natural things from a design perspective.

00:58:55.690 --> 00:59:02.690
Mechanical design considers not only the individual components of a machine, but also how they interact.

00:59:02.690 --> 00:59:09.690
From this viewpoint, human vision is a magnificent example of design.

00:59:10.690 --> 00:59:17.690
For a single eye, the cornea, the iris, and the lens interact to focus an image on the retina.

00:59:17.690 --> 00:59:22.690
The light-sensitive cells of the retina call photoreceptors produce nerve signals.

00:59:22.690 --> 00:59:32.690
Signals from the rod and cone photoreceptors are transmitted by the optic nerve to the brain, where they are processed to produce a perceived image.

00:59:32.690 --> 00:59:39.690
Now just imagine the multiplied complexity when two eyes interact.

00:59:39.690 --> 00:59:57.690
Particularly mind-boggling is the amount of information being constantly processed by more than 130 million retinal receptors and then transmitted through the 1.2 million nerve fibers of the optic nerve to the brain.

00:59:57.690 --> 01:00:07.969
To me, the sheer complexity of how all these components flawlessly interact is evidence of a superior designer.

01:00:07.969 --> 01:00:17.969
Some disagree. They propose that the eye evolve from a light-sensitive patch and some ancestral creature through small random changes.

01:00:17.969 --> 01:00:26.969
I find the proposed process unrealistic. Unlike design, it is unplanned and without a goal.

01:00:26.969 --> 01:00:36.969
We are asked to imagine that a complex system can develop without direction, while in the natural world things tend to become disorganized.

01:00:36.969 --> 01:00:39.969
But consider something even more mind-boggling.

01:00:39.969 --> 01:00:48.969
The design of the eye, the optic nerve, and brain, and how they function and interact are completely documented in our DNA.

01:00:48.969 --> 01:00:55.969
In fact, our DNA contains all the instructions for building an entire human body.

01:00:55.969 --> 01:01:07.969
While science relies only on physical explanations, many individual scientists reason that highly-ordered natural systems are evidence of a designer.

01:01:07.969 --> 01:01:15.969
My personal conclusion is that there is a God who is revealed in the magnificent designs of nature.

01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:23.400
How does faith in God's existence benefit us?

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:31.400
Having genuine faith in the loving, intelligent designer of this universe gives our lives meaning and purpose.

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:38.400
That faith is the basis for obedience to Jehovah's rights as standards, standards that benefit us.

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:42.400
But we don't fear the future because faith gives us hope.

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:47.400
We don't fear death because our hope is in the source of life.

01:01:47.400 --> 01:02:01.400
How happy we are that Jehovah has provided abundant evidence that he exists, and yet are there facets of Jehovah's personality that we couldn't fully comprehend from a study of creation alone?

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:06.400
Yes, and for this we need to study his inspired word.

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:11.400
How can we strengthen our faith in God's word?

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:23.400
Please pay careful attention to Brother Mark Newmer, a helper to the teaching committee, as he now presents the next talk of this symposium, why we have faith in God's word.

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:34.119
Have you experienced an unexpected financial setback?

01:02:34.119 --> 01:02:40.119
Is your child struggling to resist peer pressure or unwholesome influences from the internet?

01:02:40.119 --> 01:02:44.119
Have you been diagnosed with a life-threatening disease?

01:02:45.119 --> 01:02:54.119
Life in this wicked system can seem like a dark wilderness, and we may feel alone discouraged, and we just don't know where to turn.

01:02:54.119 --> 01:02:59.119
This is why more than ever we need to strengthen our faith in God's word.

01:02:59.119 --> 01:03:06.119
When we study the Bible and take it to heart, our faith in God grows and something amazing happens.

01:03:06.119 --> 01:03:12.119
Let's find out what that is at 1 Thessalonians chapter 2 and let's read verse 13.

01:03:12.119 --> 01:03:16.119
1 Thessalonians 2,13.

01:03:16.119 --> 01:03:39.119
Indeed, that is why we also thank God unceasingly, because when you received God's word, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men, but just as it truthfully is as the word of God, which is also at work in you believers.

01:03:39.119 --> 01:03:42.119
How does God's word work in us?

01:03:42.119 --> 01:03:54.119
It has already transformed us into faithful servants of Jehovah God, but it also gives us the power to remain strong under difficult circumstances.

01:03:54.119 --> 01:04:01.119
This subject is timely because we live in a world where so many plant seeds have doubt about the Bible.

01:04:01.119 --> 01:04:05.119
They say it is something outdated or inaccurate.

01:04:05.119 --> 01:04:13.119
It is our determination not to allow the world's mistaken views to erode our faith in the Bible.

01:04:13.119 --> 01:04:22.119
In this talk, we're going to look at three proofs to help us maintain our love and confidence in God's inspired word.

01:04:22.119 --> 01:04:28.119
It's prophecies, what it says about the earth, and it's survival against all odds.

01:04:28.119 --> 01:04:32.119
Let's take the first point, Bible prophecies.

01:04:32.119 --> 01:04:38.119
Beyond man's reach is the ability to foresee the future in detail.

01:04:38.119 --> 01:04:56.119
Only Almighty God can do this. For example, secular history tells us that in the year 539 BCE, a man named Cyrus conquered the land of Babylon and allowed thousands of Jewish captives to return home to restore true worship in Jerusalem.

01:04:57.119 --> 01:05:11.119
The Bible also tells us about these events, with one notable exception. While secular history recounts these events after they happened, the Bible foretold these events before they took place.

01:05:11.119 --> 01:05:14.119
In fact, some 200 years before.

01:05:14.119 --> 01:05:17.119
Let's take a closer look and see for ourselves.

01:05:17.119 --> 01:05:27.119
Let's turn to Isaiah, chapter 44, and we're going to read verses 27 and 28.

01:05:27.119 --> 01:05:36.119
And as we read these verses, please take special notice of how many times the word will appear.

01:05:36.119 --> 01:05:45.010
The one saying to the deep waters, be evaporated, and I will dry up your rivers.

01:05:45.010 --> 01:05:53.010
The one saying of Cyrus, he is my shepherd, and he will completely carry out all my will.

01:05:53.010 --> 01:06:02.010
The one saying of Jerusalem, she will be rebuilt, and of the temple your foundation will be laid.

01:06:02.010 --> 01:06:12.010
This isn't Jehovah God just guessing or trying to figure out the future. He's decided what will happen, and he will make it happen.

01:06:12.010 --> 01:06:21.010
How could the Bible predict this kind of detail some 200 years in advance? There is only one explanation.

01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:27.010
Turn a couple of chapters over to Isaiah, chapter 46, and let's read verse 10.

01:06:27.010 --> 01:06:36.670
From the beginning, I foretell the outcome, and from long ago, the things that have not yet been done.

01:06:36.670 --> 01:06:44.670
I say, my decision will stand, and I will do whatever I please.

01:06:44.670 --> 01:06:52.670
It's fulfilled prophecies like these that build trust and confidence in God's word.

01:06:52.670 --> 01:06:58.670
Now another reason we have faith in the Bible is because of what it says about the earth.

01:06:58.670 --> 01:07:05.670
Let's consider an example at Job, chapter 26, and let's read verse 7.

01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:11.429
Job, chapter 26, and verse 7.

01:07:11.429 --> 01:07:20.429
He stretches out the northern sky over empty space, suspending the earth upon nothing.

01:07:20.429 --> 01:07:25.429
Now this was stated some 3,500 years ago.

01:07:25.429 --> 01:07:36.429
Job statement would have appeared ridiculous to the Greek philosopher, Aristotle, who taught that an object must rest upon or be attached to something or else it will fall.

01:07:36.429 --> 01:07:50.429
It was not until 1687 that the scientist Isaac Newton explained that the earth is held in orbit by an invisible force appearing as if it were suspended on nothing.

01:07:50.429 --> 01:07:54.429
Now how did the Bible know the truth more than 3,000 years ago?

01:07:54.429 --> 01:08:01.429
The answer, it is the word of God, and God cannot lie.

01:08:02.429 --> 01:08:08.429
Let's take our third line of evidence, and that is the Bible's survival.

01:08:08.429 --> 01:08:23.430
Although the original books of the Bible have disappeared, accurate copies of the Bible manuscripts have survived to our day, despite natural decay, fierce opposition, and deliberate tampering with its message.

01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:30.430
Isaiah chapter 40 in verse 8 tells us the word of our God endures forever.

01:08:30.430 --> 01:08:37.430
The Bible has not endured as a mere museum display, its message has endured.

01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:42.430
That inspired message has been conveyed in over 3,000 languages.

01:08:42.430 --> 01:08:47.430
This is irrefutable proof of its divine origin.

01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:55.430
The following video presents additional evidence that the Bible is God's word. Please pay attention to this.

01:08:59.409 --> 01:09:07.409
The Bible is a book of facts. It's about real people, real events, real history, and real places.

01:09:07.409 --> 01:09:14.409
In the Hebrew scriptures, there are at least 53 people confirmed archaeologically.

01:09:14.409 --> 01:09:27.409
One example is Pharaoh Shishak of Egypt. The Bible mentions his invasion of Judah, specifically dating it in the fifth year of Judean king Rehupua.

01:09:27.409 --> 01:09:33.409
For a long time, the only record of that invasion was the one found in the Bible.

01:09:33.409 --> 01:09:42.409
Then a relief on the wall of a template Karnak Egypt was discovered depicting Shishak with captives.

01:09:42.409 --> 01:09:50.409
It also records names of conquered Israelite towns, many of which have been identified with biblical sites.

01:09:50.409 --> 01:10:01.409
It also mentions the field of Abram, the earliest reference in Egyptian records to the biblical patriarch Abram.

01:10:01.409 --> 01:10:08.409
This strengthens our confidence in faith in the Bible as God's word.

01:10:08.409 --> 01:10:14.409
The Bible was written on perishable materials such as papyrus and parchment.

01:10:14.409 --> 01:10:21.409
While no originals are known to exist today, the number of ancient copies available now is staggering.

01:10:21.409 --> 01:10:29.409
Some 11,000 Hebrew and Greek manuscripts, more than for any other ancient piece of literature.

01:10:29.409 --> 01:10:40.409
By comparing the earliest, most authoritative manuscripts, scholars can identify inaccuracies and mistakes that have crept in.

01:10:40.409 --> 01:10:45.409
But the vast majority of differences do not change the meaning at all.

01:10:45.409 --> 01:10:52.409
One example is found at Luke 417, which says that Jesus opened the skull of Isaiah.

01:10:52.409 --> 01:10:57.409
But some manuscripts say that he unrolled the skull.

01:10:57.409 --> 01:11:01.409
But isn't the meaning the same?

01:11:01.409 --> 01:11:05.409
God's message has even survived changes in language.

01:11:05.409 --> 01:11:13.409
Writers of the Christian Greek scriptures quoted the Hebrew scriptures, but often from the Greek Septuagint translation.

01:11:13.409 --> 01:11:21.409
At times, they paraphrase such quotations using slightly different wording, but the message remained the same.

01:11:21.409 --> 01:11:28.409
And most of Jesus' words, likely spoken in 1st century Hebrew, were recorded in Greek.

01:11:28.409 --> 01:11:31.409
Still, his message is clear.

01:11:31.409 --> 01:11:38.409
Today, at least parts of God's word can be read in more than 3,000 languages.

01:11:38.409 --> 01:11:42.409
The Bible's survival reveals a puzzling paradox.

01:11:42.409 --> 01:11:49.409
Throughout history, people were willing to die to preserve the Bible and make it available to everyone.

01:11:49.409 --> 01:11:55.409
Others were willing to kill, to prevent access to it and wipe it out of existence.

01:11:55.409 --> 01:11:59.409
Why? It's the book's content.

01:11:59.409 --> 01:12:02.409
God's word is alive and exerts power.

01:12:02.409 --> 01:12:11.409
It changes people's lives in ways that some welcome, but others resist violently at times.

01:12:11.409 --> 01:12:15.409
For example, responding to Roman emperor Diocletians,

01:12:15.409 --> 01:12:20.409
he did it in 3 or 3 CE to destroy the sacred scriptures by fire.

01:12:20.409 --> 01:12:25.409
Felix, the bishop of Tibyuka, reportedly said,

01:12:25.409 --> 01:12:29.409
it is better for me to be burned than the sacred scriptures.

01:12:29.409 --> 01:12:32.409
He paid with his life.

01:12:32.409 --> 01:12:40.409
Efforts to destroy God's message for mankind continue today, but the word of our God endures forever.

01:12:40.409 --> 01:12:47.939
Wasn't that faith strengthening to see more evidence that the Bible is God's word?

01:12:47.939 --> 01:12:51.939
How can we strengthen our conviction in God's word?

01:12:51.939 --> 01:12:55.939
We can do so by creating study projects to build our faith.

01:12:55.939 --> 01:13:01.939
One fascinating project involves the prophecy at Genesis 3 and verse 15.

01:13:01.939 --> 01:13:07.939
Perhaps you can quote it by heart, but have you ever sat down and taken the time to make a timeline?

01:13:07.939 --> 01:13:12.939
Listing key scriptures that show how God bit by bit shed light on the individuals

01:13:12.939 --> 01:13:15.939
and the arrangement referred to in this verse.

01:13:15.939 --> 01:13:22.939
When we take time to really study the Bible and meditate on these golden threads running through the Bible,

01:13:22.939 --> 01:13:26.939
our faith in God's word will be strengthened.

01:13:26.939 --> 01:13:28.939
Have you had doubts about something?

01:13:28.939 --> 01:13:30.939
Then write it down.

01:13:30.939 --> 01:13:35.939
Then use our research tools such as the study Bible, J.W. Library,

01:13:35.939 --> 01:13:38.939
watch our online library to dig deeper.

01:13:38.939 --> 01:13:40.939
It's worth the effort.

01:13:40.939 --> 01:13:50.340
And if you're a parent, help your children come to know and fall in love with the author of the Bible.

01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:58.340
We are so close to begin the real life in the new world now is the time to strengthen our trust and confidence in the Bible.

01:13:58.340 --> 01:14:05.340
When we have strong faith in God's word, we can feel as did our young brother Ruslan from Turkmenistan,

01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:10.340
who faces his second prison term because of his faith.

01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:12.340
He declared,

01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:18.340
I have strong faith that Jehovah will reward me where there is a strong hope,

01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:23.340
there is endless joy, where there is joy, there is strength and endurance,

01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:27.340
and a strong person can never be broken.

01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:35.340
You too will never be broken if you maintain your faith in God's word.

01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:41.340
Brother Samuel heard of the governing body will now present the next talk on this symposium,

01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:52.619
why we have faith in God's moral standards.

01:14:52.619 --> 01:14:56.619
Pressure from the world can erode our determination to do what is right.

01:14:56.619 --> 01:15:01.619
At times even a mature Christian may be inclined to do what is bad.

01:15:02.619 --> 01:15:06.619
Please find Roman 721-23.

01:15:06.619 --> 01:15:18.470
The Apostle Paul was certainly a mature, but notice what he said of himself as we read Roman 721-23.

01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:26.470
I find then this law in my case when I wish to do what is right, what is bad is present with me.

01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:31.470
I really delight in the law of God according to the man I am within,

01:15:31.470 --> 01:15:43.819
but I see in my body another law warring against the law of my mind and leading me captive to sin's law that is in my body.

01:15:43.819 --> 01:15:53.819
Like Paul we might find that we have a war or a struggle inside us as we fight against the law of sin.

01:15:53.819 --> 01:16:02.819
I ever like Paul, we know that for us to please Jehovah we must live in harmony with his standards.

01:16:02.819 --> 01:16:06.819
Look at 1 Corinthians 6, 9 and 10.

01:16:06.819 --> 01:16:11.819
What are some of Jehovah's moral standards?

01:16:11.819 --> 01:16:17.819
Notice the list of moral issues that we choose not to succumb to.

01:16:17.819 --> 01:16:22.819
At 1 Corinthians 6, 9 and 10 it says,

01:16:22.819 --> 01:16:31.380
Or do you not know that unrighteous people will not inherit God's kingdom, do not be misled?

01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:39.380
Those who are sexually immoral, idolaters, adulterers, men who submit to homosexual acts,

01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:46.380
men who practice homosexuality, thieves, greedy people, truckers, revilers,

01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:52.380
and extortioners will not inherit God's kingdom.

01:16:52.380 --> 01:17:00.380
We must be firmly convinced that these moral standards of Jehovah are right and beneficial.

01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:03.380
Why can we have faith in these standards?

01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:07.380
To find out, find the Isaiah 48 to 17.

01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:17.380
Here you will see we can have faith in God's standards because they always benefit us.

01:17:17.380 --> 01:17:21.380
Isaiah 48, 17 says,

01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:25.380
This is what Jehovah says, your repurchaser, the holy one of Israel,

01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:31.380
I Jehovah am your God, the one teaching you to benefit yourself,

01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:36.380
the one guiding you in the way you should walk.

01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:38.380
Did you see the point?

01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:43.380
Jehovah is teaching us to benefit ourselves.

01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:48.380
We can have faith in his standards of right and wrong.

01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:57.380
They are unchanging and they produce good results under all circumstances and in all cultures.

01:17:57.380 --> 01:18:00.380
Consider God's standard for marriage.

01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:08.380
Jehovah created marriage as a permanent loving union between a man and a woman.

01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:16.380
Jehovah gave Adam a wife, Eve, not Eve and B and D just Eve.

01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:21.380
He told them, be fruitful and become many, feel the earth.

01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:25.380
Let's look at 1 Corinthians 6, 18.

01:18:25.380 --> 01:18:32.380
It is making the point that sex outside of marriage is prohibited by Jehovah.

01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:35.380
1 Corinthians 6, 18 says,

01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:38.380
Free from sexual immorality.

01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:43.380
Every other sin that a man may commit is outside his body.

01:18:43.380 --> 01:18:50.380
But whoever practices sexual immorality is sending against his own body.

01:18:53.239 --> 01:18:59.239
When family members follow Jehovah's standards, the family is secure, stable and happy.

01:18:59.239 --> 01:19:07.239
In the following video, note how a couple benefited from applying God's moral standards.

01:19:07.239 --> 01:19:12.239
We met at a party when I was in the military.

01:19:12.239 --> 01:19:20.239
I was on the dance floor and I saw Frenchy and I was like, oh I'm going to talk to this girl right here.

01:19:20.239 --> 01:19:24.619
The whole time we were just smiling at each other.

01:19:24.619 --> 01:19:28.619
This instant attraction, it was mutual.

01:19:28.619 --> 01:19:31.619
Gradually, we were living together.

01:19:31.619 --> 01:19:41.960
And a few months go by and things are going well and then I find out I'm pregnant.

01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:43.960
And he left.

01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:50.270
I was shocked though I shouldn't have been, but I was shocked.

01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:57.270
And truthfully, I was scared like, what am I going to do now?

01:19:57.270 --> 01:20:03.270
I felt like a failure and I kept asking myself, how did I let this happen?

01:20:03.270 --> 01:20:10.569
I knew that I had to be there and I wanted to be there.

01:20:10.569 --> 01:20:13.569
I just didn't know how.

01:20:13.569 --> 01:20:17.569
We prayed together for the first time as a couple.

01:20:17.569 --> 01:20:22.569
That was a Friday night, Saturday morning.

01:20:22.569 --> 01:20:24.569
We had a knock on the door.

01:20:24.569 --> 01:20:27.569
We decided to have a Bible study.

01:20:27.569 --> 01:20:32.569
They had to study the chapter on family life and marriage.

01:20:32.569 --> 01:20:40.569
At that moment, I knew that I wanted to have our relationship be honorable before Jehovah.

01:20:40.569 --> 01:20:46.569
You learned that Jehovah meant for marriages to be a permanent bond.

01:20:46.569 --> 01:20:56.569
The insecurities of every disagreement ending in a breakup or divorce, all of that went away.

01:20:56.569 --> 01:21:02.569
We started to see Jehovah's training in practical ways.

01:21:02.569 --> 01:21:12.569
Just learning how to be a husband who respected and cared for his wife,

01:21:12.569 --> 01:21:16.569
we became partners, a team, a compliment.

01:21:16.569 --> 01:21:21.569
And that was only because Jehovah taught us how to do it.

01:21:21.569 --> 01:21:29.569
Though it was difficult at the outset, we made that decision to dedicate our life to do Jehovah's will.

01:21:29.569 --> 01:21:34.640
We got baptized together.

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:41.640
We've been married 25 years and the insecurities are gone.

01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:47.640
I focus on all the blessings that have come, just for keeping Jehovah in our life.

01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:57.229
And that's the best feeling in the world.

01:21:57.229 --> 01:22:00.229
You can go out on your own.

01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:02.229
But you'll never find the joy.

01:22:02.229 --> 01:22:04.229
You'll never find the peace.

01:22:04.229 --> 01:22:12.680
You'll never find the security that comes from doing it Jehovah's way.

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:17.680
It was only after coming to know Jehovah and having faith in his standards

01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:25.680
that the couple came to have a stable and enduring marriage of 25 years.

01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:27.680
What about us?

01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:32.680
How can we strengthen our faith in God's moral standards?

01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:42.680
Contemplate the benefits of obeying God's moral standards and the consequences of disobeying them.

01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:44.680
Note two Bible principles.

01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:47.680
Deuteronomy 3229 says,

01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:49.680
be wise.

01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:51.680
Ponder over this.

01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:53.680
Think about the outcome.

01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:59.680
In other words, contemplate the benefits of obeying God's moral standards.

01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:08.680
In contrast, the consequences of disobeying God's moral standards can be severe.

01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:11.680
Galatians 6.7 and 8 says,

01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:20.680
sow with a view to his flesh and reap corruption from the flesh.

01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:25.680
The world's entertainment industry often ignores this fact.

01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:32.680
Your faith and God's standards will grow as you experience the benefits of living by them.

01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:40.680
Obeying God's moral standards protects us physically, emotionally and spiritually.

01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:52.680
Jehovah's standards make us wise so that we do not have to learn from painful experiences to illustrate.

01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:55.680
You're driving and you see a sign.

01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:57.680
It says,

01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:02.680
school speed limit 15 miles an hour.

01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:06.680
What if you did not adhere to that standard of law?

01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:10.680
Suppose you are driving at 50 miles an hour.

01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:13.680
You hit a child crossing the road.

01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:16.680
The consequence for not obeying the standard?

01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:21.680
That would be an extremely painful experience.

01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:26.680
Jehovah's standards protect us from the pain.

01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:32.090
Let's conclude by sharing some verses from Psalm 19.

01:24:32.090 --> 01:24:35.090
Please turn there.

01:24:35.090 --> 01:24:42.090
This Psalm is speaking about Jehovah's standards, his laws, and reminders.

01:24:42.090 --> 01:24:46.090
We will first read Psalm 19.7.

01:24:46.090 --> 01:24:52.090
The law of Jehovah is perfect, restoring strength.

01:24:53.090 --> 01:25:01.369
The reminder of Jehovah is trustworthy, making the inexperienced one wise.

01:25:01.369 --> 01:25:06.369
We do not need to remain naive and inexperienced.

01:25:06.369 --> 01:25:08.369
We become wise.

01:25:08.369 --> 01:25:12.369
Now read with me verses 8 and 9.

01:25:12.369 --> 01:25:18.369
The orders from Jehovah are righteous, causing the heart to rejoice.

01:25:18.369 --> 01:25:24.369
The commandment of Jehovah is clean, making the eyes shine.

01:25:24.369 --> 01:25:29.369
The fear of Jehovah is pure, lasting forever.

01:25:29.369 --> 01:25:35.369
The judgments of Jehovah are true, all together righteous.

01:25:35.369 --> 01:25:39.369
Living by God's standards brings approval from Jehovah.

01:25:39.369 --> 01:25:45.369
We enjoy a clean conscience and a good relationship with Him.

01:25:45.369 --> 01:25:49.369
Finally, verse 11.

01:25:49.369 --> 01:25:58.369
By then, your servant has been warned in keeping them there is a large reward.

01:25:58.369 --> 01:26:02.369
It says a large reward awaits us.

01:26:02.369 --> 01:26:10.369
Half faith in God's moral standards obey them and become wise.

01:26:10.369 --> 01:26:16.369
They will protect you physically, emotionally, and spiritually.

01:26:16.369 --> 01:26:21.369
You will have a clean conscience and Jehovah's approval.

01:26:21.369 --> 01:26:25.369
And in the end, ever last in life.

01:26:25.369 --> 01:26:34.420
Brother Garrett Loesch of the governing body will now present the final talk of this symposium.

01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:38.420
Why we have faith in God's love.

01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:50.329
Many people believe in God, in what sense?

01:26:50.329 --> 01:26:55.329
They believe that there must exist a God, a Creator.

01:26:55.329 --> 01:26:58.329
She illogicals them to believe this.

01:26:58.329 --> 01:27:00.329
Why?

01:27:00.329 --> 01:27:04.329
Because of being aware that there is creation.

01:27:04.329 --> 01:27:09.329
If the Creator would not exist, no creation would exist.

01:27:09.329 --> 01:27:13.329
Why? Because nothing comes from nothing.

01:27:13.329 --> 01:27:19.739
This is also why we know that God has always existed.

01:27:19.739 --> 01:27:28.109
If there would have been a time when He did not exist, then nothing would exist today.

01:27:28.109 --> 01:27:34.109
The fact that creation exists proves there must be a Creator.

01:27:34.109 --> 01:27:38.109
It also shows that God exists from all eternity.

01:27:38.109 --> 01:27:44.109
Although with our imperfect human mind, we have a hard time grasping this.

01:27:44.109 --> 01:27:49.460
We are the product of His creation.

01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:54.460
But is it enough to believe in Him as the Creator?

01:27:54.460 --> 01:27:58.460
Because without Creator there could be no creation?

01:27:58.460 --> 01:28:00.460
No.

01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:04.460
Is it enough for a child to believe He has a Father?

01:28:04.460 --> 01:28:07.460
Because without Father He would not exist?

01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:11.460
No. A child should love His Father.

01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:16.460
The Father normally loves and cares for His children.

01:28:16.460 --> 01:28:21.460
The Creator, our Father, not only cares about His creation,

01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:28.460
but He also loves us and cares for us as individuals.

01:28:28.460 --> 01:28:31.460
He cares about you.

01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:35.460
Jehovah God loves you.

01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:37.460
Do you love Him?

01:28:37.460 --> 01:28:40.460
Are you a lover of God?

01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:43.460
This is not automatic.

01:28:43.460 --> 01:28:48.460
The Apostle Paul says in 2 Timothy 3, 4,

01:28:48.460 --> 01:28:57.460
that most people in this time of the end would be lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God.

01:28:57.460 --> 01:29:02.020
Sometimes we may have feelings of worthlessness

01:29:02.020 --> 01:29:07.020
and such feelings could dampen our zeal in serving Jehovah.

01:29:07.020 --> 01:29:13.020
Dampen our love or even could cause us to stop serving Him.

01:29:13.020 --> 01:29:20.020
Therefore we need to build up and deepen our love and trust in Jehovah.

01:29:20.020 --> 01:29:24.529
Jehovah loves mankind.

01:29:24.529 --> 01:29:27.529
What evidence is there for that?

01:29:27.529 --> 01:29:31.529
We see Jehovah's love in nature.

01:29:31.529 --> 01:29:37.529
He created numerous trees, plants and flowers so that we can enjoy them.

01:29:38.529 --> 01:29:43.529
He created for us not only things that we need to keep living,

01:29:43.529 --> 01:29:48.529
but things that impress our hearts with awe and love for God,

01:29:48.529 --> 01:29:53.970
the giver of every good gift.

01:29:53.970 --> 01:29:59.970
Man is not able to create one single animal or even fruit and flower.

01:29:59.970 --> 01:30:07.970
The things God created help us to live and enjoy living for as long as we do.

01:30:07.970 --> 01:30:13.970
But Jehovah loves mankind so much that he gave his firstborn spirit son

01:30:13.970 --> 01:30:20.970
whom we came to know as Jesus Christ as ransom for the sins of us imperfect humans,

01:30:20.970 --> 01:30:28.970
for those who love Him so they may live and enjoy God's love forever.

01:30:28.970 --> 01:30:34.699
Although the first humans rebelled against Jehovah God,

01:30:34.699 --> 01:30:41.699
Jehovah knew that there would be many others who would choose to serve Him out of love.

01:30:41.699 --> 01:30:46.699
Please turn with me to John chapter 6.

01:30:46.699 --> 01:30:55.300
You are listening in to this program is proof not only of your love for Jehovah God and Jesus,

01:30:55.300 --> 01:31:02.300
but also of their love for you as an individual.

01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:08.300
In John chapter 6, 44, Jesus said,

01:31:08.300 --> 01:31:16.090
No man can come to me unless the father who sent me draws him.

01:31:16.090 --> 01:31:24.189
The scriptures show that Jehovah has given humans free will.

01:31:24.189 --> 01:31:29.189
Everyone has a choice when it comes to serving Him.

01:31:29.189 --> 01:31:36.189
God gently draws to Himself those who have a heart that is rightly disposed.

01:31:36.189 --> 01:31:43.630
Jehovah does so through the Bible's message and through His Holy Spirit.

01:31:43.630 --> 01:31:46.630
How does Jehovah draw us?

01:31:46.630 --> 01:31:54.630
The Greek verb rendered draw is used in reference to hauling in a net of fishes.

01:31:54.630 --> 01:32:00.630
Does Jehovah drag us against our will, forcing us to serve Him?

01:32:00.630 --> 01:32:01.630
No.

01:32:01.630 --> 01:32:08.630
Jehovah gave us free will so He does not force our heart open.

01:32:08.630 --> 01:32:11.630
One scholar puts it this way.

01:32:11.630 --> 01:32:16.630
There is no handle on the outside of the door of the human heart.

01:32:16.630 --> 01:32:18.630
It must be open from within.

01:32:18.630 --> 01:32:25.359
Jehovah searches through the billions of hearts in this world,

01:32:25.359 --> 01:32:29.359
looking for individuals who are inclined toward Him.

01:32:29.359 --> 01:32:36.250
When He finds such a person, He responds in a touching way.

01:32:36.250 --> 01:32:39.250
Are you such a person?

01:32:39.250 --> 01:32:42.250
We trust you are.

01:32:42.250 --> 01:32:51.250
Jehovah gently attracts or tugs at the heart of ones who are rightly disposed.

01:32:51.250 --> 01:32:59.250
Jehovah does so in two ways through the Bible's message of good news and through His Holy Spirit.

01:32:59.250 --> 01:33:04.250
When Jehovah sees a heart that is responsive to Bible truth,

01:33:04.250 --> 01:33:11.250
He uses His Spirit to help the individual to grasp and apply that truth in his life.

01:33:11.250 --> 01:33:17.560
Without divine help, we could never become genuine followers of Jesus

01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:21.560
and devoted worshipers of Jehovah.

01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:25.560
Jehovah draws people because He sees something good in their heart

01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:29.560
and cares about them as individuals.

01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:34.560
Does knowing that Jehovah cares about His worshipers as individuals

01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:41.560
move you to want to open that door of your heart and open it wide?

01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:46.560
As you watch the following video, notice how a brother named Carlos

01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:53.560
came to appreciate that Jehovah is the loving father whom He had always yearned for.

01:33:53.560 --> 01:34:00.659
When I went through difficult times during my childhood,

01:34:00.659 --> 01:34:13.430
Jehovah was like my father. He was my refuge.

01:34:13.430 --> 01:34:27.060
The first memory I have of my dad is when I went to visit him in the prison where he was being held.

01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:32.439
I asked Jehovah so many times for my dad to come back home.

01:34:32.439 --> 01:34:36.439
One day, my mom said, Dad's coming home today.

01:34:36.439 --> 01:34:40.439
I went to school and when I came back, he was there.

01:34:40.439 --> 01:34:44.439
I thought he was finally back for good and that it would be forever.

01:34:44.439 --> 01:34:53.979
But soon after that, I heard my mom and my grandmother crying

01:34:53.979 --> 01:35:01.600
and they started to explain that my dad was back in prison.

01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:05.600
From then on, I felt hatred, resentment, and anger toward my dad

01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:09.600
and also towards Jehovah.

01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:18.920
I started to take drugs to leading in moral and violent lifestyle.

01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:29.319
One day, a couple of sisters gave me a magazine.

01:35:29.319 --> 01:35:31.319
As I was looking through it,

01:35:31.319 --> 01:35:37.199
I saw the experience about Dustin.

01:35:37.199 --> 01:35:40.199
I began to think about the times during my childhood

01:35:40.199 --> 01:35:42.199
when I would take refuge in Jehovah

01:35:42.199 --> 01:35:44.199
and would feel the same way Dustin did.

01:35:44.199 --> 01:35:48.539
I would say, Jehovah is there. He hasn't abandoned me.

01:35:48.539 --> 01:35:53.539
Dustin never doubted Jehovah's love right up until the day he died.

01:35:53.539 --> 01:35:58.939
That very night, I prayed to Jehovah.

01:35:58.939 --> 01:36:01.939
I asked him to forgive me because

01:36:01.939 --> 01:36:09.569
well, because it wasn't his fault.

01:36:09.569 --> 01:36:13.569
That night, I poured out all my feelings to Jehovah.

01:36:13.569 --> 01:36:23.229
That burden that I felt was finally gone.

01:36:23.229 --> 01:36:27.229
I felt Jehovah's love every step of the way.

01:36:27.229 --> 01:36:30.229
He showed it through the brothers who didn't judge me for what I had done.

01:36:30.229 --> 01:36:42.130
It doesn't matter how many problems we have

01:36:42.130 --> 01:36:47.140
or how far we've drifted away from Jehovah.

01:36:47.140 --> 01:36:57.300
He never abandoned us.

01:36:57.300 --> 01:37:01.300
Jehovah has lovingly helped many brothers and sisters

01:37:01.300 --> 01:37:03.300
because of his love for them.

01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:08.300
This can reassure you that Jehovah will help you as well

01:37:08.300 --> 01:37:11.300
because Jehovah loves you too.

01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:17.579
Did you notice how Jehovah demonstrated his love for Carlos?

01:37:17.579 --> 01:37:22.579
Through his worshipers, Jehovah lovingly cared for this young man.

01:37:22.579 --> 01:37:26.579
Please turn with me to Psalm 119.

01:37:26.579 --> 01:37:31.149
Jehovah had not forgotten Carlos,

01:37:31.149 --> 01:37:34.149
even though he had strayed for a time.

01:37:34.149 --> 01:37:42.149
This reminds us of the words in Psalm 119, verse 176.

01:37:42.149 --> 01:37:45.149
I have strayed like a lost sheep,

01:37:45.149 --> 01:37:47.149
searched for your servant,

01:37:47.149 --> 01:37:52.149
for I have not forgotten your commandments.

01:37:52.149 --> 01:37:57.149
There are indications that Psalm 119 may have been written

01:37:57.149 --> 01:38:00.149
by young Prince Hezekiah.

01:38:00.149 --> 01:38:03.149
Hezekiah poured out his heart to Jehovah

01:38:03.149 --> 01:38:06.149
and Jehovah responded.

01:38:06.149 --> 01:38:11.149
Brothers and sisters, please pour out your heart to Jehovah

01:38:11.149 --> 01:38:16.689
and take note of how he will answer your prayers.

01:38:16.689 --> 01:38:21.689
Please turn with me to Ephesians chapter 3.

01:38:21.689 --> 01:38:27.689
Jehovah can and will intervene positively in your life.

01:38:27.689 --> 01:38:33.689
Notice what it says at Ephesians 3, verse 20.

01:38:33.689 --> 01:38:36.689
Now to the one who can, according to his power

01:38:36.689 --> 01:38:38.689
that is operating in us,

01:38:38.689 --> 01:38:41.689
do more than super abundantly

01:38:41.689 --> 01:38:45.689
beyond all the things we ask or conceive.

01:38:45.689 --> 01:38:52.100
The expression, his power that is operating in us,

01:38:52.100 --> 01:38:57.100
is this not something very encouraging and faith strengthening?

01:38:57.100 --> 01:39:00.100
His power is not just operating in us,

01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:04.100
but operating in us super abundantly.

01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:07.100
No, but more than super abundantly,

01:39:07.100 --> 01:39:12.100
beyond what we can envision or comprehend.

01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:17.100
He will draw close to you, says James 4, verse 8.

01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:20.100
Whether he wrote Psalm 119 or not,

01:39:20.100 --> 01:39:25.100
Hezekiah strengthened his faith in Jehovah and trusted him.

01:39:25.100 --> 01:39:29.100
He did so even though he was surrounded by false worshipers

01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:33.100
and may have been ridiculed by members of the royal court.

01:39:33.100 --> 01:39:37.439
Jehovah blessed his Echaya.

01:39:37.439 --> 01:39:41.439
If you trust Jehovah, he will bless you as well.

01:39:41.439 --> 01:39:49.439
With reliance on God, you too can endure trials as integrity keepers.

01:39:49.439 --> 01:39:52.439
Apply Bible principles in your life

01:39:52.439 --> 01:39:59.439
and see how following Jehovah's advice will always work out for your good.

01:39:59.439 --> 01:40:05.750
Strong faith in God's love helps us to see beyond our imperfections

01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:09.750
or negative experiences that we may have had in the past.

01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:16.750
We see ourselves the way Jehovah sees us as cherished part of his household.

01:40:16.750 --> 01:40:22.750
We are a family member of Jehovah's family.

01:40:22.750 --> 01:40:32.750
Notice the encouragement we receive at Psalm 119, verse 132.

01:40:32.750 --> 01:40:38.750
Faith in God's love gives us the confidence that we need to keep going.

01:40:38.750 --> 01:40:46.479
In Psalm 119, verse 32, it says,

01:40:46.479 --> 01:40:53.359
I will eagerly pursue the way of your commandments

01:40:53.359 --> 01:40:58.359
because you may groom for it in my heart.

01:40:58.359 --> 01:41:04.359
The footnote says, or possibly you make my heart have the confidence,

01:41:04.359 --> 01:41:08.359
we will be able to endure any trial.

01:41:08.359 --> 01:41:13.359
Are there things that can separate us from Jehovah's love toward us?

01:41:13.359 --> 01:41:19.609
Do you recall what we are told at Romans 8?

01:41:19.609 --> 01:41:25.609
Nothing can separate us from Jehovah's love toward us.

01:41:25.609 --> 01:41:35.609
Let's read this together in Romans 8 and 35 to 39.

01:41:35.609 --> 01:41:43.479
Who will separate us from the love of the Christ?

01:41:43.479 --> 01:41:50.479
Will tribulation or distress or persecution or hunger or nakedness or danger or sword?

01:41:50.479 --> 01:41:56.479
Just as it is written, for your sake, we are being put to death all day long.

01:41:56.479 --> 01:42:01.479
We have been accounted as sheep for slaughtering on the contrary.

01:42:01.479 --> 01:42:10.479
In all these things, we are coming off completely victorious through the one who loved us.

01:42:10.479 --> 01:42:15.479
For I am convinced that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor governments,

01:42:15.479 --> 01:42:19.479
nor things now, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depths,

01:42:19.479 --> 01:42:24.479
nor any other creation will be able to separate us from God's love

01:42:24.479 --> 01:42:30.500
that is in Christ Jesus, our Lord.

01:42:30.500 --> 01:42:35.500
But there are things that can diminish or kill our love for Jehovah,

01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:39.500
so we need to be careful.

01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:44.500
This symposium has reminded us of why we have faith in God's existence,

01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:50.500
His word, His moral standards, and His love.

01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:53.500
As the world around us grows more hopeless,

01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:59.500
we are determined to become more and more powerful by faith.

01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:05.000
About Abraham, Romans 4.20 says,

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:11.000
but because of the promise of God, he did not waver in a lack of faith,

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:17.000
but he became powerful by his faith, giving God glory.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:21.000
Similarly, Jehovah has also given promises to us,

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:25.000
and as he progressively fulfills them,

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:33.000
we become more and more powerful by our faith and give glory to Jehovah God.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:40.180
Thank you, brothers, for highlighting our reasons for faith.

01:43:40.180 --> 01:43:43.180
We will now sing song number 37 entitled,

01:43:43.180 --> 01:43:47.180
Serving Jehovah Hold Sold.

01:43:47.180 --> 01:43:50.180
Again, that's song number 37.
