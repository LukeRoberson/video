00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:08.140
Revelation chapter 7 verse 9 speaks of a great crowd composed of many tongues, or as the

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.460
foodnot reads, languages.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.059
This Bible prophecy has taken on new meaning in the past century of Kingdom Rule, with

00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:22.059
translation now taking place in over 700 languages.

00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:28.100
Many of these languages are operating from remote translation offices or RTOs.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.179
One example is the country of Mozambique.

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:36.539
These offices are located in the area where the language is spoken rather than at the

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:38.140
branch.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.140
Remote translation office guidelines outline how the branch committee works along with

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.020
the writing committee, publishing committee, translation services, and the worldwide design

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.340
construction department in considering relocating or starting a translation team in a remote

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.259
location.

00:00:58.259 --> 00:01:03.579
RTOs are presently functioning in different ways in various parts of the world.

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.739
At times, the personnel live in one location and work in another.

00:01:08.739 --> 00:01:17.730
This includes using full-time and part-time commuters for both translation and support services.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:23.530
The standard of facilities provided or the operation of the RTO may not be the same as the local

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:24.530
branch.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:31.250
At times, the fastest way to start operation is to rent or purchase existing facilities

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.890
and if needed, carry out renovation work.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.170
For example, this method was used to acquire the housing units for the American Sign Language

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.379
RTO in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:52.379
If building a new RTO with the only option in an area, the standard plans have been developed

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:54.420
for use.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.420
RTOs and servants work along with the regional design construction departments in planning

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.379
a project and then traveling to the chosen location and working along with local construction

00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:12.150
servants and volunteers in building the RTO.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.590
RTO construction gives both the local brothers and construction workers the joy of knowing

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:25.909
they also are playing a part in reaching the hearts of people in their language.

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:31.189
The positive results in constructing RTOs is experience about those involved in their

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:34.430
construction and those who translate from them.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.949
We just love the project.

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:40.550
The RTO family is so much fun to work with, it's a small family and so as we're caring

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.270
for the needs of each other throughout the days and the weeks and the months, we just

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.069
really find a lot of joy in it.

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.189
It's been a ton of fun and we get to do it all in the shadow of a palm tree.

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:55.789
The greatest joy is that our brothers give up their energy and above all, they work

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:59.509
with much happiness for Jehovah.

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:05.789
Our recent relocation to the RTO home and office will fit so many of our translation needs

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:06.789
going forward.

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:14.509
It helps us to hear and to speak the language every day because we use it in the ministry

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:20.389
and as meetings, so that helps us to translate in a way our audience can easily understand.

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:25.509
When you go out in the ministry, you'll find that there are so many different ways

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:31.949
something can be said, so you can have flavor in your translation work as well.

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:37.949
Attending a congregation meeting with so many deaf really helps with translation.

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:42.310
Being in the audience when the information is presented at the meetings, a translator

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:49.110
can see by the facial expressions of those around him if the information is clear and understandable.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.669
Saying them comment gives us an insight into whether they really understand.

00:03:54.669 --> 00:04:01.270
In just the last few years, over 300 RTOs have been established worldwide.

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:08.389
We have a head of us plans for over 100 RTOs to be established in the next few years.

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:14.870
Jehovah is truly blessing this work so that people of all languages in the most distant

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.550
parts of the earth may come to know him.
