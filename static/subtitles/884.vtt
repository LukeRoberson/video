00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:16.179
I was a very challenging student, and I was someone who loved a party, loud music, dancing.

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:21.859
I would get to the party right when it started, and I would stay until the very end.

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.579
She had many changes to make. I was afraid to bring it up.

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.740
I don't know what it was about that energy and that music. It was just made me feel alive,

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.740
you know? I don't know. It was very powerful.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:44.899
I would say, oh, Jehovah, how can I tell her, Rackel, the way you were living is not Jehovah's way.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.250
I didn't think I would actually have to let go of anything. I thought I could do what I wanted

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:57.570
and serve Jehovah too. So it took me a while to help her understand that there was no way around

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.729
having to make major changes. I remember saying, all right, that's it. No, I don't agree. This is not

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:14.290
going to happen. Then I'd say, that's it. She's not coming back. When I started to understand

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.849
that to please Jehovah, I would have to give up some of those things. There was no satisfaction

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:23.489
in any of them anymore. The hair, the makeup, the whole persona. Being there just didn't make sense

00:01:23.489 --> 00:01:28.370
anymore. I remember getting home and thinking, Hackel, what are you doing with your life?

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.230
There was such a void, such a big void, but maybe feeling that emptiness was what I needed.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.659
It took me a while to understand that Jehovah's ways are superior and would only benefit me.

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:56.739
You could see how the truth was impacting her life and she started making changes. It was wonderful.

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:02.579
She helped me come to the conclusion that based on the Bible, no, this type of lifestyle,

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:15.389
this type of partying, never will be conducive to the life I want to lead. But Jehovah and the

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:19.870
angels, they didn't give up on me. They were able to find a little bit of good through it all.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.150
They helped me every day, no matter what I was going through. They were always there.

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:32.460
The first I doubted that she would change because I was looking at the situation from my own point

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:39.979
of view, how I was helping, what I was doing. That it's not me, it's Jehovah who brings about change.

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:43.819
We're just tools that he uses to help others change.

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:49.580
Honestly, if Marilda hadn't talked to me and made it clear what I needed to change,

00:02:49.580 --> 00:03:02.909
I don't think I ever would have changed. We should never doubt if Jehovah is drawing someone

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:14.669
that person could change. I was only able to help her because of Jehovah.
