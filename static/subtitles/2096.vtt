00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:09.570
In the wake of the European Court of Human Rights, Landmark Judgment, Viatian vs. Armenia,

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.609
the Armenian government not only released imprisoned conscientious objectors, but began

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:18.089
offering alternative civilian service.

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:23.410
Two prominent human rights experts, Mr. Niles Muzniyaksa, Mr. Richard Clayton, discuss

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.769
how this right of conscientious objection to military service is now recognised as part

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.090
of one's freedom of thought, conscience and belief.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.570
These experts also consider the implications of acknowledging this right in its effect

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.409
on national security and its need for global recognition.

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:52.460
Well, the current standard, I think, was enshrined in the Bahtian against Armenia, judgment

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.780
of the European Court of Human Rights, is that under Article 9 of the Convention, freedom

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.939
of thought, conscience and religion, but there is a right to conscientious objection.

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:09.219
And if somebody's beliefs prohibit them from doing military service, then forcing them

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:13.099
to do this service is a violation of their freedom of religion, belief and conscience.

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:19.780
The most important development has been the grand chain of the decision of the European

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.500
Court of Human Rights in relation to Armenia.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:30.260
It basically catapulted conscientious objection from being a relatively minor figure in the

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.060
human rights world to being a much more significant one.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.659
Almost every country now recognises the right to conscientious objection, and there is

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.819
a consensus on this Europe-wide, and this is why they took this path-breaking judgment.

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:52.299
And I think the Court was very far reaching in recognising that a consensus now exists

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:59.700
and this is no longer a matter for individual member states to decide.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.019
Human rights does not harm one's security, but enhances security.

00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:10.699
I very often hear the argument that implementing human rights is dangerous for security.

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:14.819
I think we're seeing this now with the surveillance issues.

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.620
We saw this with conscientious objection.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.659
So I would say that, yes, of course, states have a responsibility to protect the security

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:27.699
of their population, but they must do so while upholding human rights, and that there's

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:30.419
no contradiction between the two.

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:38.139
And ultimately, that issue and how it plays out is decided by balancing the individual's

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:43.259
rights against the rights of the community, the interests of the community, and coming

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:44.860
to a proportionate balance.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:52.259
Clearly, A, there has to be scope to reject the invitation to be conscripted.

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:57.900
There has to be space to act for an alternative.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.219
And that has to be done in a way which is provide some protection for people with rights and

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:05.219
views.

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:08.060
And I think that what we see now is a dialogue works.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.659
Dialogue can lead to positive change, and that that change does not harm anybody's security.

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:20.860
It doesn't reduce anybody else's rights, but that it's good for Armenia and it's good

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.460
for Europe.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.939
The question of conscientious objection being part of an individual's right to express

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:42.460
their thoughts is a universal point which ought to prevail in any part of the world.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.060
There's no reason why one should regard it as inherently European.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.139
I mean, it's just an issue of principle, and the principle seems to me to have equal

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:54.819
force wherever it applies.

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:00.340
So I'm hoping that this will have good echo effects, and the member states will be proactive

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.060
and change their policies and not wait for additional judgments with European Court

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.300
of Human Rights.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:11.860
The Batian judgment certainly indicates that any country must has to rethink the way it

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.219
addresses these things.

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:18.899
The viewpoint of the international community is clear.

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:23.899
The right of conscientious objection to military service applies everywhere, as part of

00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:27.939
one's freedom of thought, conscience, and belief.

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:33.699
In practice, all but a small number of countries recognize this fundamental right.

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:40.180
Even so, many are now in prison in Eritrea, Nagorno-Karaba, Singapore, Turkmenistan, and

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.660
more than 600 in South Korea.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.899
Jehovah's Witnesses look forward to the time when all respect the dignity of fellow

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:49.860
humans and their conscience.
