00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.980
What do I need to do?

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.980
Have you ever asked yourself that question?

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.980
Well, if you're like me,

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.980
you ask yourself that question every day.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.980
Sometimes several times a day.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.980
What do I need to do next?

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.980
But there's a little bit more to that question,

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.980
and maybe you haven't asked yourself this in a while.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.980
What do I need to do to inherit ever-lasting life?

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.980
And maybe that's a question you asked

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.979
when you were first studying the Bible, and rightly so.

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:35.979
Or maybe during your course of your Gilead training,

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:39.979
you asked yourself that question a number of times.

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:44.979
Well, in the Bible, there were two men who asked Jesus

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:46.979
that same exact question.

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:48.979
Both of them asked Jesus the question

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:53.979
in the last six months of Jesus' earthly ministry.

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:56.979
Though it was the same question,

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:58.979
the answers were different.

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:01.979
Let's look at the first one.

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:08.980
Luke 10 and verse 25.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.980
Now look, a man, versed in the law,

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.980
stood up to test him and said,

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.980
teacher, what do I need to do to inherit ever-lasting life?

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.980
Well, Jesus very astutely understands that this man is already versed in the law.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.980
He probably already has an idea,

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.980
but it seems his motive may be more to test Jesus than get an answer.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.980
So what does Jesus do?

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.980
Jesus lets him answer his own question in verse 26.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.980
What is written in the law? How do you read?

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.980
In verse 27, the man gives an amazing answer.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:55.980
In one sentence, this man sums up the entire mosaic law.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:04.980
He does it exactly the same way that Jesus had done so on two different occasions.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.980
Well, Jesus, no doubt impressed.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.979
He said to him in verse 28,

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.979
you answered correctly. Keep doing that.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.979
You'll get life.

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:15.979
Good lessons here for us.

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:18.979
When we're talking with people about the Bible and our ministry,

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:21.979
sometimes we may detect they have a little knowledge,

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:23.979
flip the question back to them.

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:25.979
What do you think or better yet?

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:27.979
What do you read?

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:30.979
Another thing we can do is found in verse 28,

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:33.979
commend a person if they give a correct response.

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:38.979
Let them know that you think ever-lasting life is within their reach.

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:41.979
But this man has another motive surface now.

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:46.979
He moves from testing Jesus to wanting to prove himself righteous.

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:48.979
In verse 29, he says,

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:50.979
who really is my neighbor?

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:52.979
Now, being Jewish and versed in the law,

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:55.979
he's already got an idea on this one, too, doesn't he?

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:56.979
He's probably thinking,

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:59.979
Jesus is going to tell me what I want to hear.

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:03.979
Are my Jewish friends, perhaps in my village,

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:06.979
especially those who follow the law?

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:08.979
Well, if so,

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:11.979
that question would be a little limiting, wouldn't it?

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:13.979
Who really is my neighbor?

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:17.979
Isn't really the best question.

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:20.979
So how does Jesus get around this motive that he's got

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:22.979
of proving himself righteous

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:26.979
and yet correct his viewpoint on a neighbor?

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:28.979
Well, as you know, there's a beautiful parable here,

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:30.979
the neighbor Lee Samaritan,

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:34.979
where Jesus describes a situation here in verse 30, 31, 32.

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:37.979
Man is going down from Jerusalem to Jericho,

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:39.979
falls victim to robbers, they strip him,

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:42.979
beat him, leave him half dead.

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:46.979
But by coincidence, a priest goes down that road

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:49.979
but passes by on the opposite side.

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:52.979
The same thing happens with a Levite,

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:54.979
passes by on the opposite side.

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:56.979
These are men who have responsible positions

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:58.979
in God's organization,

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:02.979
how callous, how insensitive.

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:04.979
Good lesson here for us.

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:06.979
We may have responsible assignments

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:10.979
and Jehovah's organization never allow that

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:14.979
to cause us to become callous to another person's needs,

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:17.980
even putting our downtime, so to speak,

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.980
ahead of caring for someone.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.980
Well, you'll notice the Samaritan is very different,

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.980
33, 34.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.980
He's traveling this road, he's moved with pity,

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.980
he approaches him, bandages the wounds,

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.980
pours oil and wine on them,

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.980
mounts the poor man on his own animal,

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.980
brings him to an inn, takes care of him,

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.980
evidently all that day.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.980
The next day, verse 35,

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.980
he takes out two denariah,

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.980
two days wages, gives them to the innkeeper,

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.980
says, take care of him,

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.980
whatever you spend besides this,

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.980
I will repay you when I return.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.980
Two days wages evidently,

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.980
he spent everything that he had

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.980
because he was going to have to come back

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.980
to give the innkeeper more,

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.980
all for a man who was a Jew

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.980
who would likely under normal circumstances,

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.980
not even greet him.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.980
Well, Jesus then asked another question,

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.980
but this time Jesus changes the man's question.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.980
Not who is my neighbor,

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.980
but who of these three seems to you

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.980
to have made himself neighbor

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.980
to the man who fell victim to the robbers.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.980
Isn't that a better question?

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.980
It isn't who is my neighbor.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.980
How can I make myself a neighbor?

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.980
Well, the man gets the point,

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.980
and he answers correctly again.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.980
He doesn't say Samaritan,

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.980
maybe he can't go that far,

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.980
but he says the one who acted mercifully.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.980
Now, Jesus says,

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.980
go and do the same yourself,

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.980
and the account ends there

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.980
on a positive note.

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:04.980
Well, we learn a lot,

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.980
don't we, about talking with people

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.980
in our ministry,

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.980
and even in our day-to-day conversations

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.980
at work with our brothers and sisters?

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.980
When others have a question,

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.980
never belittle the question.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.980
Simply help them to come to the right conclusion.

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.980
We never want to criticize someone

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.980
for a motive that may not be the best,

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.980
just kindly respond.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.980
Maybe a parable in illustration

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.980
will help them get the point.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.980
Well, now, this isn't the only time

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.980
Jesus had to deal with that question.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:39.980
As I mentioned,

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.980
let's go to another occasion,

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.980
and this time we're going to go

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.980
to Luke 18 and verse 18.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.980
And here, we find that this man

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.980
is not well versed in the law,

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.980
but he's a ruler,

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.980
and the Bible says that he's very rich,

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.980
and in another gospel,

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.980
it also says he's young, rich,

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:05.980
and young, and a ruler.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.480
Not always the best combination,

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.480
but notice here in verse 18,

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.480
this conversation starts with him running up to Jesus,

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.480
unbended knee, good teacher.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.480
What must I do to inherit every lasting life?

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.480
Well, Jesus can't let this one go.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.480
You don't want to call Jesus something

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.480
that should be only true of Jehovah.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.480
That is a title of being a good teacher.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.480
So he gives him a gentle correction there,

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.480
in verse 19,

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.480
and then in verse 20,

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.480
Jesus describes, of course,

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.480
explained some of the 10 commandments,

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.480
but the man in verse 21 says,

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.480
all these have kept from my youth on.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.480
In other words,

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.480
what else am I lacking?

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.480
Well, after hearing this,

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:58.480
Jesus' acknowledge is there actually is something lacking.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.480
In verse 22,

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.480
one thing,

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.480
sell all the things you have,

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.480
distribute the proceeds to the poor,

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.480
you will have treasure in the heavens,

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.480
and come be my follower.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.480
Well, that's almost too much for him to take.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.480
In Mark's account,

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.480
it tells us at this point,

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.480
that Jesus felt love for the man

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.480
because he clearly saw that he was sincere.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.480
But although he was sincere in his question,

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.480
he couldn't do it, could he?

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.480
When he heard this,

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.480
he became deeply grieved

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.480
for he was very rich.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.480
Mark says he had many possessions.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.480
Well, we learn a few things from this parable, don't we?

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.480
We learn that sometimes people that have good motives

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.480
don't always have good qualities.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:54.480
In this case, he was simply too attached to his things,

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.480
and that prevented him from gaining one of the best privileges

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:01.480
he could have possibly had in following Jesus.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.480
So, from these two accounts,

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.480
we learned some things.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:10.480
First of all, we learned that we can learn from a Samaritan.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.480
Have you ever learned from a Samaritan?

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.480
I know I have.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.480
One day, many years ago, I was driving down the road

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.480
and I had a flat tire,

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.480
and I had a spare tire,

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.480
but the tools I didn't have.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.480
So, this is before the days of cell phones.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.480
I walked up to the nearest house.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.480
I said, can I use your phone?

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.480
Please, to call a tow truck.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.480
And the man said, well, why?

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.480
I need to change my tire.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.480
He says, I'll help you.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.480
He comes out of his house, gets his tools,

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.480
and in no time, changes my tire.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.480
As he's doing so, I'm thinking to myself,

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.480
he's of another religion.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.480
He's of another culture, another racial background.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.480
He's changing my tire.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.480
As I'm driving away, I'm thinking,

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.480
Jehovah taught me something today,

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.480
from a Samaritan.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.480
So, what do we learn?

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.480
It's not such a bad idea, occasionally,

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.480
to ask this question, is it?

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.480
Two men were wise to do so.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:13.480
Unfortunately, at least one of them didn't follow through.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:17.480
But occasionally, if we say to Jehovah, please,

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.480
what do I need to do to inherit everlasting life?

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.480
We can be sure that Jehovah will answer that prayer,

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.480
maybe through personal study or Bible reading,

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.480
or it might even be through a Samaritan.
