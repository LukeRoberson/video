WEBVTT

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:09.519
Our family has been planning for this trip for quite a while.

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:18.660
Along with a large group of friends, we're doing a special work in the Australian Outback.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:35.189
Over a week, we'll be visiting remote communities and station properties in an area bigger than France.

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:40.189
We're camping out in the bush, so we have to take all our gear with us.

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:55.070
Doing things together as a family, especially spiritual things.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.070
Really draws us closer together.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:31.140
To reach as many people as possible, each car group covers a different region.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.140
Some station properties are 300 kilometres apart.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.140
From the front gate to the house can be 30 kilometres.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.140
Levi, your turn. You and Marley, huh?

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:51.299
Hey, we're just making a free call on properties now.

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.700
Let's see, we're going to find them and talk about whatever it is.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.700
We love watching people's eyes light up when they see what the Bible really teaches.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.700
It makes us feel so glad we've come.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.300
About 200 Jehovah's Witnesses are working along with us.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.300
They come from nearly every state in Australia.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.300
The whole group has travelled over 140,000 kilometres,

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:25.639
and along the way we've left thousands of our publications with people.

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:31.639
Some people have asked us to stay in touch by telephone, letter or email.

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:41.819
Each night, we share experiences around the campfire.

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:52.259
At the end of the week, the whole group meets up in Julia Creek for a public meeting.

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:56.259
Many of the locals were really impressed that we had travelled so far.

00:02:56.259 --> 00:03:02.729
This troupe has drawn us closer as a family and closer to Jehovah.

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:05.729
What could be better than that?
