00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.690
And now, from Andrew to John, the Apostle John.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.289
He was living at a most critical time.

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:13.689
The last surviving Apostle.

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:17.289
He was helping to hold back a tidal wave of worldly influence

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.289
and apostate thinking that was already eroding

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:26.570
the Christian congregation under divine inspiration.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.449
John wrote a most vigorous letter to his brothers.

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.490
We can still sense in him that fiery enthusiasm

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.850
that earned him his name, Son of Thunder.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.329
And that letter, the letter that we're going to look at right now,

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.929
will show you, you like John can thunder for Jehovah.

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:51.409
Well, how can you do that?

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:52.890
Let's find out.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.289
We're going to open up now to 1 John, chapter 1.

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:58.890
We're going to read verse 1 and 3.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.530
And watch how John makes very clear his objective

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.329
right from the outset.

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:08.129
1 John 1, verse 1.

00:01:08.129 --> 00:01:11.329
That which was from the beginning.

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:14.209
Now, the beginning was with Christ Jesus

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:15.650
and his pre-human existence.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.890
He was the first born of all creation.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.569
We have heard which we have seen with our eyes,

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:29.450
which we have observed and our hands have felt him.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.090
And notice that John right away wants to grab the attention

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.209
of the brothers and to say, look, we heard him.

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:38.609
We've seen him with our eyes.

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:39.569
We've observed him.

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:40.329
I felt him.

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:41.530
I touched him.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.650
I laid my head in his chest.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.769
Did John even hear his heartbeat?

00:01:48.769 --> 00:01:51.849
Well, the fact is, is that these messages were so clear

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:54.409
to John and he wanted to make it known.

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.450
Notice verse 3, that which we have seen

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.930
and heard again, John repeats this.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.450
His teachings, I saw them.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.409
I heard them.

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.409
I'm so convinced that God's powers operating through him

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.889
that they're in verse 3.

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:14.569
John says, we are reporting also to you.

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.689
I'm reporting this to you, John said.

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:20.610
John had such good reason to thunder.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.930
He was a living link to Christ.

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:26.169
The brothers alive at that time did not have the privilege

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:29.250
that John had to walk and to touch

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.689
and to be taught by Jesus personally.

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:33.129
But John did.

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:35.610
And he was so moved by these experiences

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.930
that he wanted to report these real life experiences

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.090
about Christ.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.449
But why?

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:44.810
To protect his brothers.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.210
To protect his beloved brothers from the false teachers

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.650
at that time who were trying to draw them away

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.210
from the truth, you see John spoke up against lies

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.449
that the apostates and the other false teachers

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:00.090
were spreading in his day.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.210
They were telling disgusting lies about God in Jesus.

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:08.969
They craftily constructed speeches designed

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:11.409
to corrupt the teachings of Christ.

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:13.689
John knew that, he felt it.

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:16.449
They even claimed to have secret revelations

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:18.729
and superior knowledge and they both said

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.729
they were the correctors of the apostles, liars.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.729
And John could not stomach liars.

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:30.490
And it is of interest out of the 15 times

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.050
the Bible used the word liar.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.370
He used the word eight times.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.169
You see John continued to thunder, defend and speak out

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:41.169
for the truth.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.969
Because he loved the truth, he loved Christ Jesus

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:50.969
and he loved the father, Jehovah.

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:56.909
Similarly today, lies and false reports against the truth

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:01.590
abound and enemies of the truth use any means

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.669
to try to smear the reputation of Christ's brothers.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.509
But now what's the point?

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:10.909
Your time here at world headquarters,

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:13.150
your time with the governing body,

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.270
your time with the responsible brothers

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.629
from world headquarters convinces you.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.709
First hand, had any negative reports

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.990
that you hear about the organization are lies.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.230
And now you can thunder for Jehovah

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.350
by defending the truth about those whom Christ appointed

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.470
to take the lead in his organization.

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:36.069
And look what you've been able to do.

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:39.790
You can say just like John, look, I've heard, I've seen,

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.269
I've observed, I've felt that is me.

00:04:42.269 --> 00:04:44.829
I've had a close up view.

00:04:44.829 --> 00:04:47.430
This is even a closer look than you can have

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.589
on CW broadcasting.

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:53.480
This is one on one in the flesh.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.560
And you can say, I've had a close up view

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.040
of God's spirit directed organization.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.040
And now I am reporting to you, my beloved brothers

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.639
and sisters and the assignments that you have.

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.360
That's what you can do now.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.720
What I have seen and I've heard.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.040
And in this way, imagine what you can do to strengthen,

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.399
stabilize and build confidence in your brothers.

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:22.319
This is your responsibility now.

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:25.600
This wasn't coming here to school just to have a good time.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.879
I know you did have a good time,

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:29.120
but that wasn't the objective.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.879
The objective is now that you go out

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:32.519
and you serve your brothers.

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:34.120
All of you, each and every one of you,

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.439
brother, sister, single, married, it doesn't matter.

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:39.920
Your brothers and sisters now deserve

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.839
a Gilead graduates reward.

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:44.399
And you're going to give it to them.

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:50.009
And you thunder in doing that.

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:54.819
Now let's go back to the Apostle John.

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:57.620
You see, John's thunder never diminished to a low rumble.

00:05:58.579 --> 00:06:00.180
Think about it.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.019
What did John do when he was released from prison

00:06:03.019 --> 00:06:05.939
on the island of Patmos at nearly 100 years old?

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:07.180
What did he do?

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.259
I mean, did he say I'm a weak old man?

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:12.220
There's nothing I can do anymore.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.139
No, no, no.

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:16.500
You see, he knew the apostasy was coming

00:06:16.579 --> 00:06:19.459
and that oppressive wolves were already misleading

00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:24.459
the brothers, but John said, not on my watch.

00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:29.540
And he would continue to thunder for Jehovah

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.459
by using his every fiber of his being

00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:35.300
to help his brothers write down to his dying breath.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.180
How did he do that?

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:42.259
He wrote four Bible books

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:46.459
and including the portion that we just read here

00:06:46.459 --> 00:06:48.420
in first John chapter one.

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:51.459
He didn't retire.

00:06:51.459 --> 00:06:54.620
He was still full of fiery enthusiasm

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.620
wanting to help his brothers because he loved the truth.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.579
But what helped John to keep the thunder rolling?

00:07:02.579 --> 00:07:03.500
What helped him?

00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:08.740
He knew the final outcome.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:14.980
You see, a 96 CE before his release,

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.339
he received that unexpected flash of light,

00:07:18.339 --> 00:07:23.339
the revelation, a vision of 144,000,

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.259
kingdom conquerors who will rule with Jesus in heaven.

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:29.180
He got that.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:33.819
Then he was told about an integrity keeping great crowd

00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:37.100
out of all the nations that would worship God in truth.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.100
He got that.

00:07:39.019 --> 00:07:41.660
Can you imagine how that strengthened his conviction

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:46.980
that in spite of the apostasy, he said true worship

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.810
would not be extinguished?

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:51.850
So think about it.

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:57.529
If a prophetic vision of the great crowd

00:07:57.529 --> 00:08:02.129
encouraged John to continue to fight and defend the truth,

00:08:02.129 --> 00:08:03.730
what about you?

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:08.730
You who see not a vision, but the reality of its fulfillment.

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:12.730
Now John is seeing the reality from heaven, true,

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:16.730
but you have a front row seat right here on earth.

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:20.730
As you witness, the greatest preaching effort in history

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:23.730
and you watched Jehovah perform a modern day miracle

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:27.730
by gathering a great crowd from all the nations.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.730
No matter what we face now,

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:35.730
or in the future, keep the thunder rolling.

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:36.730
Why?

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:41.730
Because you know the final outcome.

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:46.970
You see it already developing.

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:50.970
John continued to thunder for Jehovah,

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:55.970
but he mellowed through the years of faithful service.

00:08:55.970 --> 00:09:00.970
His fiery enthusiasm is now on display in perfect balance.

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:04.970
A man who once wanted to call down fire from heaven

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:09.970
to get results, now uses a force much stronger

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:12.970
and more effective.

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:14.970
What is it?

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:16.970
Love.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:20.970
Fact first, John chapter 2 and verse 14.

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:24.970
Notice what he says here in just since the love

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:29.340
that he has when he writes verse 14.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.340
I write to you, fathers,

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.340
because you have come to know him

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.340
who is from the beginning.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.340
I write to you young men,

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.340
because you are strong.

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.340
The word of God remains in you,

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.340
and you have conquered the wicked one.

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.340
Can you sense the love?

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:52.340
John is saying, look, the word of God remains in you.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.340
He used the powerful force of love to commend his readers

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:59.340
because they never lost their heartfelt appreciation

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:00.340
for the truth.

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:03.340
Can you see yourself doing that?

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:07.340
You see, thunder without love is just noise.

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:10.340
But be determined to lovingly commend your brothers

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.340
for their endurance.

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.340
Thank them for their integrity.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:18.340
Commend them for their unselfish love.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:21.340
Touch their hearts when you speak with them.

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:24.340
Our brothers need encouragement,

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:29.129
not criticism.

00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:32.129
Well, as I look at each one of you,

00:10:32.129 --> 00:10:35.129
I have a lot of thoughts going through my mind.

00:10:35.129 --> 00:10:36.129
I do.

00:10:36.129 --> 00:10:37.129
I mean, here you are.

00:10:37.129 --> 00:10:40.129
I mean, all of the memories are flooding through my mind,

00:10:40.129 --> 00:10:42.129
flooding through my heart.

00:10:42.129 --> 00:10:44.129
It's amazing.

00:10:44.129 --> 00:10:46.129
As I look at you,

00:10:46.129 --> 00:10:48.129
I can still hear your comments.

00:10:48.129 --> 00:10:51.129
But you know what else I can hear?

00:10:51.129 --> 00:10:53.129
I can hear each day when you came to class

00:10:53.129 --> 00:10:55.129
how you thundered into that classroom.

00:10:55.129 --> 00:10:56.129
You did.

00:10:56.129 --> 00:11:00.129
I have never seen such a thunderous class.

00:11:00.129 --> 00:11:03.129
There you are each morning, hugging each other,

00:11:04.129 --> 00:11:06.129
clapping for their morning worship comments,

00:11:06.129 --> 00:11:07.129
commending each other.

00:11:07.129 --> 00:11:09.129
It's as if you hadn't seen each other in three months.

00:11:09.129 --> 00:11:10.129
It was just last night.

00:11:10.129 --> 00:11:12.129
You saw each other.

00:11:12.129 --> 00:11:14.129
But oh, no.

00:11:14.129 --> 00:11:18.129
You thundered in appreciation for divine truth

00:11:18.129 --> 00:11:20.129
and for the privilege to be here at school

00:11:20.129 --> 00:11:24.129
and for each other's integrity keeping course.

00:11:24.129 --> 00:11:26.129
Now, as you leave,

00:11:26.129 --> 00:11:29.129
what do we want you to remember?

00:11:29.129 --> 00:11:32.129
We want you to remember how you can keep the thunder rolling.

00:11:33.129 --> 00:11:35.129
How can you do that?

00:11:35.129 --> 00:11:37.129
I'm going to give you three ways.

00:11:37.129 --> 00:11:42.299
One, defend the truth.

00:11:42.299 --> 00:11:45.299
Don't allow false reports and lies about the organization

00:11:45.299 --> 00:11:48.299
that you love, the organization that you love and cherish,

00:11:48.299 --> 00:11:53.299
the very organization that brought you to these seats.

00:11:53.299 --> 00:11:56.299
Never allow lies and false reports to stop you

00:11:56.299 --> 00:12:01.299
from reporting what you have seen and heard firsthand.

00:12:02.299 --> 00:12:05.299
Two, remember the final outcome.

00:12:05.299 --> 00:12:07.299
True worship will prevail.

00:12:07.299 --> 00:12:10.299
You already see it doing so.

00:12:10.299 --> 00:12:15.299
And three, use the powerful force of love.

00:12:15.299 --> 00:12:18.299
Use love to command and fortify your brothers,

00:12:18.299 --> 00:12:20.299
encourage them, build them up.

00:12:20.299 --> 00:12:22.299
Use love.

00:12:22.299 --> 00:12:25.299
And like John, with all your might,

00:12:25.299 --> 00:12:29.299
with all your ability, thunder for Jehovah.
