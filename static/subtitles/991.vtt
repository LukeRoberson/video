00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.040
If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:12.640
This familiar saying might be true with human promises, but is certainly not true with

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.480
promises from Jehovah.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.679
They always come true.

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:24.359
Just before his death, at the age of 110, Joshua reminded the Israelites why Jehovah's

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.039
promises can always be trusted.

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:34.000
He said, not one word, out of all the good promises that Jehovah your God has spoken

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.159
to you has failed.

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:39.600
They have all come true for you.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.960
Among all of Jehovah's good promises are the heartwarming restoration promises given

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.799
to the Jews returning from exile in Babylon.

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:54.520
Since the land of Judah had laid in desolate for 70 years, the Jews wouldn't have expected

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:00.880
brand new homes waiting for them to occupy or fields ready for them to harvest.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.120
There would be much work for them to do once they arrived.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.760
There were many unknowns about their future, which could have caused some to worry or be

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.680
anxious.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.920
Some family heads might have wondered, where will we live?

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.760
How will I feed my family and keep them safe?

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:28.879
Jehovah calmed their hearts, with the reassuring promises recorded at Isaiah 65, 21 and 22.

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:35.439
Let's read these together at Isaiah 65, 21 and 22.

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:41.599
And there it reads, they will build houses and live in them, and they will plant vineyards

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:43.640
and eat their fruitage.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.959
They will not build for someone else to inhabit, nor will they plant for others to eat.

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:55.239
For the days of my people will be like the days of a tree, and the work of their hands

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:59.879
my chosen ones will enjoy to the full.

00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:03.840
These promises must have strengthened the Jews.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.319
Jehovah didn't say that they might build and live in their own homes, and they might enjoy

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.439
the fruitage from their vineyards.

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:19.919
No, he told his precious chosen ones that they will enjoy these promises to the full.

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:25.039
Even though they hadn't been told every detail, and there were many unknowns regarding

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:29.599
their future, they knew their God Jehovah.

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:36.439
They knew that his promises were for their good, and that they would all come true.

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:39.520
And those promises did come true.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:46.520
Knowing that God fulfilled all of his promises in the past, strengthens our trust and confidence

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.080
that all of his promises for the future, like the ones that we read in Isaiah 65, will

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.960
all come true for our everlasting good.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.840
What a joy it will be to build and then live in our own home, never having to worry that

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.639
we will lose it because of a natural disaster or economic collapse.

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:15.159
Sadly though, many of our brothers and sisters today do suffer the harsh realities of living

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:17.840
in this old system of things.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:24.360
For example, a sister in Poland named Gabriella experienced great loss when her home was nearly

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.759
destroyed by a flood.

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:29.360
How did she maintain her joy?

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.430
Notice what she said.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.830
I don't want to talk about what I lost.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.590
Those are just material things.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.189
Rather, I want to tell you how much I gained.

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:47.789
This experience reassured me that being a part of the Christian congregation is a unique

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:52.750
privilege as well as a source of joy and happiness.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.430
So although she went through some very difficult times, what did she gain?

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.349
Joy and happiness.

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:03.750
What about a single sister from Puerto Rico named Onel?

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:10.909
She endured a very difficult test back in 2017 when Hurricane Maria destroyed her home.

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:14.750
As a result of that storm, she lost her job.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.350
Notice what she recalled.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:24.990
During those difficult days, I felt anxious, but I learned to trust in Jehovah through prayer

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.550
and not let anxiety paralyze me.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:35.189
She also said, following the direction of the organization helped me to remain calm.

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:41.990
I saw Jehovah's hand in the spiritual encouragement I received as well as the material assistance provided

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.790
by the Brotherhood.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:51.470
Jehovah gave me much more than I could even ask for, and my faith was greatly strengthened.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:59.269
So she received assistance from Jehovah, from his organization, and she was greatly strengthened.

00:04:59.269 --> 00:05:00.269
What about you?

00:05:00.269 --> 00:05:04.790
Are you suffering some sort of storm in your life?

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:11.629
Perhaps from a natural disaster or maybe a figurative one caused by a health issue, a family

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:15.389
problem, or some injustice?

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:22.029
During such times, it's normal to experience feelings of anxiety, worrying about our future,

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:28.230
the safety of our family, but don't allow such feelings to paralyze you.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:36.110
Like Gabriella and Onel, keep doing what you can and continue trusting in Jehovah.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.230
Also, continue to trust in our loving Brotherhood.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:48.350
Our brothers and sisters are true friends who are ready to show love in our time of distress.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:55.389
They will quickly come to our aid by providing practical assistance and relief provisions.

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:59.990
They will help us rebuild our home, rebuild our life.

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:05.589
They will build us up, stabilize us with words of encouragement.

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:11.589
When we put our complete trust in Jehovah and his promises, we received the best protection

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:13.389
possible.

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:18.350
Note what the Psalmist wrote at Psalm 91 verses 1 and 2.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.189
Psalm 91, 1 and 2.

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:27.029
Is anyone dwelling in the secret place of the Most High will lodge under the shadow of

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:28.509
the Almighty?

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:37.310
I will say to Jehovah, you are my refuge and my stronghold, my God in whom I trust.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.310
What a beautiful reminder of protection from Jehovah.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.870
But what is the secret place of the Most High?

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:50.430
Well, it's a figurative place of spiritual security and protection.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:58.230
Those who dwell or lodge with God as his personal guests and remain there are safe from anything

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:04.430
or anyone that threatens their faith and their love for God.

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:13.110
We can be sure that Jehovah will never abandon those who trust in him, not now, not ever.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:18.790
As you watch the following video, envision the secure future that lies ahead when we will

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:25.860
enjoy complete security.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:30.540
Do you long for a home of your own?

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:47.769
Jehovah promised the returning exiles that they would build and enjoy comfortable dwellings.

00:07:47.769 --> 00:08:01.459
Jehovah likewise cares for us whether we lose our home or we are taken from it.

00:08:01.459 --> 00:08:14.939
Above all, true worship provides spiritual security that is found nowhere else.

00:08:14.939 --> 00:08:21.139
The spiritual home we have now reminds us that Jehovah will give us a physical place to

00:08:21.139 --> 00:08:51.019
call home in the new world.

00:08:51.019 --> 00:09:01.009
They will build houses and live in them.

00:09:01.009 --> 00:09:04.009
What a beautiful video.

00:09:04.009 --> 00:09:09.889
It helps us imagine what we will experience in the near future when all of God's promises

00:09:09.889 --> 00:09:13.370
become a reality on a paradise earth.

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:21.889
And we truly are safe, cared for in every way, physically, spiritually and emotionally.

00:09:21.889 --> 00:09:25.529
Would you like to read another comforting promise from Jehovah?

00:09:25.529 --> 00:09:30.409
It's found in Isaiah, chapter 65, and verse 23.

00:09:30.409 --> 00:09:37.250
And there it says, they will not toil for nothing nor will they bear children for distress,

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:42.610
because they are the offspring made up of those blessed by Jehovah and their descendants

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:44.850
with them.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:52.129
This must have brought great comfort to the Jews and how comforting it is for us today.

00:09:52.129 --> 00:09:58.330
In the new world, all families will experience Jehovah's blessing and enjoy the results

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.090
of their hard work.

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:07.330
In the meantime, if you have lost your home or possessions or if you experienced loss

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:13.289
in the future, keep focusing on Jehovah's good promises.

00:10:13.289 --> 00:10:20.490
Strong faith can help you to weather any storm, literal or figurative.

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:26.929
Trust that Jehovah will hear and respond to your needs, even anticipating them.

00:10:26.929 --> 00:10:33.929
He promises to open his hand and satisfy the proper desire of every living thing.

00:10:33.929 --> 00:10:39.009
That promise includes you and your family.

00:10:39.009 --> 00:10:45.809
Continue to take delight in all of God's promises, knowing that not one word out of all the

00:10:45.809 --> 00:10:50.490
good promises that Jehovah your God has spoken to you has failed.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:55.529
They will all come true for you.

00:10:55.529 --> 00:11:00.210
Brother Leonard Myers, a helper to the writing committee, will now present the next talk

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:02.049
of this symposium.

00:11:02.049 --> 00:11:07.490
Take delight in God's promises of peace, the wolf and the lamb will feed together.
