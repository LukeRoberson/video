00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:10.779
January 21, 2017, became a special day for deaf people in Japan.

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:15.779
Jehovah's Witnesses released the Book of Matthew in Japanese Sign Language.

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:21.320
What, though, was behind these smiles?

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.370
When I used to read the Japanese Bible, I really didn't understand it.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.370
So I forced myself to read, not much of a joy.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:36.369
Right, it was hard to understand and explain to people.

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:42.369
The Bible, written in a language we do not know, will not move our heart.

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:49.369
Having no sign language Bible was a huge disadvantage when it came to cultivating a longing for God.

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:55.369
When making shepherding calls, reasoning on a scripture with a deaf person was difficult,

00:00:55.369 --> 00:01:00.369
if that scripture wasn't translated into sign language.

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:04.370
There is a Bible in American sign language.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:11.370
So I was envious and wanted to see the Bible in Japanese Sign Language so much.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:18.370
At last, approval was given to the Bible translation into Japanese Sign Language.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:24.370
I noticed that the translation team offered a prayer before they started each day's work.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:30.370
Also, when faced with difficult translation problems, they relied on Jehovah's Holy Spirit through prayers,

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.370
so that they could exercise good judgment. It was impressive.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:42.370
There are various processes needed for God's Word to jump off the page and reach the heart of deaf people.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:48.370
They considered carefully how to express scriptures so that deaf people understand.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.370
Let's take an example, the lilies of the field, at Matthew 6, 28.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.620
I wasn't able to understand Matthew 6 until now.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:06.620
I always thought, birds of heaven and lilies of the field, what do they have to do with seeking first the kingdom?

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:13.620
The translators individually read and research the source text to fully understand what they'll translate.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.620
Then the team meets to discuss the text and explore ideas for translating certain concepts.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:28.620
After translation is complete, the assigned brother signs the translation to prepare the prompt video.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.620
Then, studio recording takes place, referencing the prompt video.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.629
The recorded movie is carefully edited and delivered to the deaf people.

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:53.169
In this case, the signer pretends to be a flower and weaves his own petals and soars them on his face.

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:58.169
Then he asks, flowers don't do that, do they?

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:03.169
God's Word coming off the pages has reached the heart of deaf people.

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:11.539
I understood for the first time that Jehovah is kindly teaching us.

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:16.539
If you seek the kingdom first, I'll give you everything you need.

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:20.780
Don't worry.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.780
I was watching on the train on my way to work. I thought, wow, this is so good!

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:34.110
I was absorbed in the video and I missed my train station.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:41.110
So I changed trains, but again, I was watching the video and I missed my station again.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:47.639
The book of Matthew is that interesting.

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:52.639
Humans have beneficial feelings because we are created in God's image.

00:03:52.639 --> 00:04:00.460
But because of Satan's system of things, these feelings are driven away.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.460
However, when you show God's Word to people or read it yourself,

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.460
innate beneficial feelings well up in our hearts.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.460
I strongly feel that God's Word has the power to do that.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.459
Just like a child grows up listening to what the Father says,

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:27.459
I can be closer to my Father Jehovah by watching him speak to me in my native tongue, Sign Language.

00:04:27.459 --> 00:04:33.459
Comments from Deaf Brothers show that the Sign Language Bible talks to their heart directly.

00:04:33.459 --> 00:04:39.459
I imagine that Jehovah loves our brothers and his face is shining,

00:04:39.459 --> 00:04:46.529
and the faces of our brothers are also shining.

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:51.529
Now, by means of having God's living Word in the language of their heart,

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:56.529
our Deaf brothers and sisters are seeing Jehovah's Face shining.
