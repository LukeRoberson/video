My name is Pierre Musney. I studied law in different universities in Europe, in France, England, Czech Republic, and

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:25.399
eventually I had my PhD which I defended in 2004. I have become a doctor of law.

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:34.700
I was born in former Czechoslovakia and of a communist regime, where religion or religious beliefs were not promoted.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.700
And also the thought of God being a creator of the universe was considered as a nonsense.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:54.700
Concerning evolution, I would say merely following the mainstream thinking that I came to realize that we should really question things that are around us.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:01.700
All the theories and explanations that are given. But we shouldn't take as granted all that we hear.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:09.700
And especially, when somebody says that this thing is obvious or heaven, so just don't question or obey or listen to it.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.700
I am now a specialist in law and in logic, human thinking.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:23.700
And there is one basic principle which provides the whole universe is the principle of cause and effects.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.700
So every effect around us must have a cause.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.700
You walk in a forest and right in the middle of the forest you see a bench. The bench is the effect.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.700
What is the cause? Is this accidental or deliberate?

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.700
Somebody must have made it because the principle is something designed must have a designer.

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:58.459
For me, when I see such a diversity of flowers, of trees, of butterflies, I come to the conclusion the one who put that law of diversity was there to tell us.

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:02.459
Please enjoy life.

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:11.460
Because life was beautiful, somebody who created it must be somebody having beautiful qualities.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:20.460
Thanks to the study of the Bible, I could put a picture, a face, symbolically speaking, to the one who created life.
