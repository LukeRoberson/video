00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:09.150
Let's open to the context of our day's text, Matthew chapter 26, verse 31, is where we can begin.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:17.230
And the words originally uttered here in our day's text were a response to Jesus' serious

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:26.670
statement about the fulfillment of inspired prophecy, namely, all of you will be stumbled in

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.429
connection with me on this night. For it is written, I will strike the shepherd and the sheep of

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:37.149
the flock will be scattered about. But after I have been raised up, I will go ahead of you into

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:43.789
Galilee. But Peter, in response, uttered the words of today's text, which essentially amounted to

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:51.070
excuse me, Jesus, I take exception to that. You're totally wrong about your assessment of my

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.950
integrity under pressure. Now, of course, I can understand why you might say that about James and

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.149
John, Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew, James, the son of Alfias and Thedias, Simon,

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:10.030
the Canony, and even my dear brother, Andrew. But as far as I'm concerned, you're totally wrong in

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:18.189
your assessment of my response to pressure. Well, we love Peter for his unmitigated affirmation of

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:25.469
loyalty, but he did throw all of his brothers under the horse-drawn cart in order to elevate himself.

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:31.469
And what was at the root of that? It's a snare that any one of us could fall into.

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:40.989
In days past, we used to refer to it as the snare of self-confidence. That's the wording

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:47.629
that was used in a subheading, appearing in the Watchtower of January 1, 1998. And in that article,

00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:55.549
reference was made to Psalm 85 and verse 8. Let's turn there and notice how it reads,

00:01:56.349 --> 00:02:06.670
in our 2013 edition, it says, I will listen to what the true God Jehovah says for he will speak

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:15.069
peace to his people, to his loyal ones, but let them not return to over-confidence. If you're using

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:22.189
the JW Library app and you tap the 8, you'll notice that the reference Bible or the preceding

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:30.669
edition uses the expression, let them not return to self-confidence. And a similar update can be

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:39.469
noted in the text of Proverbs chapter 14, verse 16, which reads, the wise one is cautious and turns

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:47.469
away from evil, but the stupid one is reckless and over-confident. However, this used to read,

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:55.550
the stupid one is becoming furious and self-confident. So really, we get the understanding in the 2013

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:04.509
edition that the problem is not actually self-confidence of itself, but over-confidence or excessive

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:12.189
confidence in oneself, boastful self-confidence. Really, over the years, many times our publications,

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:18.909
even particularly awake, have drawn attention to the need for a measure of self-confidence,

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:26.430
articles on how fathers can actually build this quality in their children, how those who are

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.189
overcoming ailments can regain a measure of self-confidence. So it's not self-confidence that's

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:36.990
wrong, but over-confidence. First Corinthians chapter 10, verse 12 puts it this way, in fact,

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:45.550
let's turn there together and notice the context, first Corinthians chapter 10. And Paul recalls the

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:53.069
history of the ancient nation of Israel for the benefit of his readers in verses 6 through 11,

00:03:53.069 --> 00:04:02.430
and then verse 12 says, so let the one who thinks he is standing beware that he does not fall.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:11.789
Now is the scripture saying, don't even try to stand, don't stand, don't think you're standing.

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:18.189
Well, no, how could that be? For Paul later wrote even in the same letter to the Corinthians,

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:24.509
first Corinthians chapter 16, verse 13, stay awake, stand firm in the faith. Carry on as

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:31.629
men grow mighty. Or in his follow-up letter, second Corinthians chapter 1 verse 24, he wrote,

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:40.350
it is by your faith that you are standing. So we should try to stand, stand, and even think we're

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.509
standing. Otherwise, why would Paul tell the Corinthians it's by your faith that you are standing

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:49.149
if he didn't really want them to think that they were standing. The imperative word in first

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:57.470
Corinthians chapter 10 verse 12 is beware. Once we become confident of our standing, we have to be

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:06.189
aware. Remember why we are standing. Remember how we are standing. And remember what boastful

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:12.670
self-assurance, such as Peter manifested in our day's text, can actually do to our standing.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.550
What can it do to our standing? Well, if we begin to grow in self-confidence to the extent that we

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:26.110
lose sight of its dangers, we're vulnerable. We can actually veer dangerously close to

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:35.550
hazards to our spirituality, like what? Well, it depends on our weakness. Satan knows what those are.

00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:42.910
In the context, 1 Corinthians chapter 10 verses 6 through 11, the dangers listed are sexual

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:51.389
immorality, idolatry, murmuring, putting Jehovah to the test. We may know the seriousness of these

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:56.670
things, or we may at least know that these are wrong, but if we don't appreciate the danger of

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:03.149
self-confidence, excessive self-confidence, we might think I'm no longer at risk, allow ourselves

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:12.189
to be exposed to situations where enticemen overwhelms our reason, exposure. I have to be so careful

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:18.750
to what we expose ourselves to on the internet, even if we think we're strong. A television can

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:28.350
expose us to the lives of people who have no faith in Jehovah. Quite recently, researchers discovered

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:34.829
that whereas mice typically react instantly to the very scent of cats, mice that are deliberately

00:06:34.829 --> 00:06:40.269
exposed at a very early age to the strong scent of cats are much less likely to be alarmed by their

00:06:40.269 --> 00:06:50.670
presence and much less likely to flee deliberate exposure at first, induces overconfidence later.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:56.750
Well, happily most mice aren't subject to the experimentation by scientists, but the point is,

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:03.629
we can't let down our guard to Satan's world. Once we detect its odor, we have to understand the

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:10.110
danger and flee. We may feel safe in our relationship with Jehovah confident in our standing encouraged by

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:17.389
evidence of his help, but we continue trusting in Jehovah's power and not in our own intelligence

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:23.870
or strength. Moses, Solomon, David, the Apostle Peter fell into sin. Why should we ever feel that we

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:31.470
are not vulnerable? And there's so many ways in which overconfidence might ensnare us these days,

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:39.870
but the encouraging thing is what it states in our text comments. Peter is an excellent example

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:48.029
of one who accepted Jehovah's help to overcome boastful self-assurance and Peter succeeded.

00:07:48.029 --> 00:07:54.990
And so can we.
