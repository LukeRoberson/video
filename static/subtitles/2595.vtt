00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:06.040
Moving the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses out of Brooklyn, New York, which has been

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:12.359
there over a hundred years, and to take it upstate to a rural setting is a monumental task.

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:18.800
From the first moment that the Watchtower representatives came to the town, they came with their

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.800
concept and what they wanted to do, I would say that they were very professional from day

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.800
one.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.359
They expressed a great willingness to be cooperative, they wanted to understand our

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.439
process, and they wanted us to understand what they intended to do.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.039
When we come into a community, we're not developing something and moving on.

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:40.759
We're developing it to live and work in, and so we want it to be also agreeable with

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:43.759
the community and have their input on it.

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:49.399
The location is surrounded by a pristine park that's been preserved, and for them to

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.200
go in there and clean that site up and remove the environmental issues, to me is just a

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.200
total home run for not only the town of Warp, but the state of New York.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.159
The state forest was working with us on what our facility would look like from the hikers

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.040
and the trails and so forth around there, and so early on we did an exercise where we

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.159
actually measured the tops of the buildings and put a balloon up there, and then from the

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.200
various trails in the area could verify that they would not be seen.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:26.200
Something that our planning board asked for during the process was very readily given,

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.400
there were no complaints, they said, yes, we want to do this right, we want to work with

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.400
you.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.959
And then good dialogues throughout the construction project, especially the beginning

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:39.640
phase, helped us understand where we needed to adjust and to accommodate our neighbors.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.319
My overall experience with Watchtower has been, I guess, in one word, professionalism,

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:46.319
attention to detail.

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:48.319
They don't cut any corners.

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:54.239
Sometimes there's companies trying to save money here in the air, trying to cut a corner

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:58.319
here in the air, and I've never witnessed anything like that with working with this organization.

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:03.319
I've been here since the project started, been here many times through inspections.

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:08.319
I've never worked around so many professional people who have the same goal.

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:15.319
Any questions I had from reviewing the project to doing the inspections just went so smoothly?

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.319
Everyone is always on top of any situation that may arise.

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:26.319
There's always self-inspections and just the tenacity to just keep going day after day, you know,

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.319
dedicated crews always to fix any problem that may arise.

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.319
I've really actually never had the opportunity to work with the more inviting group.

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.319
Every time I come by the site, it's just a pleasure.

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.319
You don't really get to have that experience in construction all the time, so it's refreshing, really.

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.319
What was interesting about our project is we had contractors and volunteers together,

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.319
men and women, and coming from different parts of the country.

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.319
Most of the workforce here is volunteers, but I find that term misleading,

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:04.319
because, you know, everybody that I worked with was completely professional and very well-trained.

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.319
They're so professional, it's just wonderful.

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.319
I wish they would call the projects, but like this, tell you the truth.

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.319
Everybody was really courteous, polite, and, you know, morale was at an all-time high here.

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.319
Out of the 14 plus years I've been with the planning board,

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.319
I'd have to say the best applicant to work with are none.

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:29.319
Really, this organization and this job site really is a testimony to how one's spirituality,

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:34.319
how important it is to every day, you know, every aspect in life.

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.319
We can really see the community loves their area.

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.319
They love their town, they love their neighborhood, they love their community,

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.319
and it's nice to work with people like that, because we too are good stewards of the land.

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:52.319
We too want to enjoy the community, want to be safe, and not only environmentally, but in other ways.

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:59.319
And so it's really nice to see the devotion that these folks have to having a good place for their families to live,

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.319
and we're very excited to be a part of that community.

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.319
We're excited about the concept. This is going to be the World Headquarters.

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:13.319
We understand that the members of the Jehovah Witnesses will be coming to visit the site.

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:20.319
It'll be on their list of things to do, which we find exciting.

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:24.319
There's going to be thousands of visitors each year from around the world.

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:29.319
They're going to be coming to see the facilities and to see the community and the neighborhood that we live in.

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:37.319
They're regular folks that will also come to enjoy what we know here in Warwick as just one of the most beautiful spots in New York,

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:39.319
and even in the United States.

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:45.319
We think it's going to be a great boost to our community, we're excited about it, and we welcome it.
