00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.750
Well, we've got the text I was given a thorn in the flesh.

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:08.269
We're gonna talk a little bit about that.

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:12.830
So, you think or you may say,

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:17.309
I know what it means to have a thorn in the flesh.

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:18.989
I feel it.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:20.670
It hurts.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.199
It's like stepping on a sharp needle with your barefoot.

00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:30.019
It hurts.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.899
But now here's a question.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.020
Is A, that is one,

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.899
needle in your foot, that bad.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:42.859
Just one needle.

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.020
I bet it hurts.

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:49.780
I see that picture up there.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.500
See a little blood coming out.

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:56.420
Looks like you're ready to slap it, but I don't think you'd do that.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.979
But I bet it hurts.

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:01.539
It's more than just a sting.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:06.719
Just one thorn in the flesh.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.159
It hurts.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.359
But, uh, suppose that that's all you have.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.640
One thorn in the flesh.

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:20.159
But what can hurt worse?

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.239
Take a look.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.200
Ooh, look at all those thorns.

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.400
All over the man's body.

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:34.719
Now, I'm gonna tell you a little bit about this man.

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.040
This man fell into a pile of thorn.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.840
Thorn, he barberry branches.

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.560
And when he tried to get up, he fainted from pain

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:53.599
because by thousands of needle-like thorns.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.200
Or any such thing.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.219
So the following six years, both he and doctors

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.939
picked barbs from the body,

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:15.310
totaling 32,131 thorns at hurts.

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:20.259
Now, what did I hear you say about your one needle?

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.960
But you say, but it's hard to take brother hurt.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.400
It hurts and it's perplexing.

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:30.560
It's getting me down.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.349
Well, can you still walk?

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:36.750
Then you move about.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.099
Paul didn't let his needle, whatever it was,

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:43.539
get him down.

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:45.620
He had to live with it.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:52.099
And with Jehovah's help, you too will be able to handle the discomfort.

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:58.879
Now, if you can, take a look at what the Bible says.

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.919
Something that Paul wrote.

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:05.680
2 Corinthians chapter 4 verses 89.

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:07.919
This is what he says.

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:14.159
We are hard-pressed in every way, but not cramped beyond movement.

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.800
We are perplexed.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.560
I want you to concentrate on that word perplexed.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.159
But not absolutely with no way out.

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:28.319
We are persecuted, but not abandoned.

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.159
We are not down, but not destroyed.

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:37.310
Now, think about it, when did you get your thorn?

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.189
Was it before your dedication and baptism?

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:50.849
Before you were baptized, you prayed earnestly from the depths of your heart to Jehovah for forgiveness.

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:56.050
Now, you must accept his merciful forgiveness.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.370
But it still hurts from time to time.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.689
Paul didn't say it wouldn't.

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:09.090
Yes, you were knocked down, but not cramped on beyond movement.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.490
So, what do we say?

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:20.769
We say, stand up, get off the ground, get on your feet, move forward toward the new world.

00:04:22.209 --> 00:04:24.370
They suggest around the corner.

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:27.199
Here's something to think about.

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:29.759
Think about King David.

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:35.360
He got another man's wife pregnant, and then he tried to hide it, but it couldn't.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.399
So, he had him killed.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:46.449
Now, he repented from the heart, and Jehovah forgave him, he found solace.

00:04:47.649 --> 00:04:52.449
However, Jehovah did not eliminate the painful consequences of his sin.

00:04:53.889 --> 00:05:00.050
Their effects were to continue with David for the rest of his sinful, imperfect life.

00:05:04.579 --> 00:05:07.779
What do you think of when you see a beautiful little hummingbird?

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.829
Isn't that something?

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.579
What comes to my mind when I see one?

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:24.060
Me at the age of 12 or 13, walking in the woods near my house,

00:05:25.019 --> 00:05:32.699
upon seeing a hummingbird, on a limb of a tree, I took my sling shot and pebble,

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:39.579
and knocked it out of the tree, stone dead.

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:43.949
I wasn't in the truth at the time.

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:49.069
I killed a beautiful little bird, for what reason?

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:50.509
Couldn't eat it?

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.279
Well, maybe to prove to myself that I was a dead shot with my sling shot.

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:04.689
Jehovah created the colorful little bird to bring delight to the eye.

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:08.639
Well, that's a sad experience.

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:10.720
That's mine, not yours.

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:12.879
But do you have one?

00:06:14.079 --> 00:06:15.040
A sad experience?

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:24.160
Some painful experiences may not quickly leave the brain after repentance and God's forgiveness.

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:26.079
But what do we say?

00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:28.399
We say, don't dwell on them.

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:32.480
Don't keep them before your eyes all the time.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.439
Push them aside by thinking about good things.

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:44.240
Why not open the door to your brain and mind and let the good things come in?

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:52.000
Simply put, put a bandage on your thorn a little while longer.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:07:00.079
Jehovah will pluck it out very soon now, and the pain will be long gone forever.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.639
Remember this verse?

00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:09.040
This may have been one of the first verses that you took to memory, put to memory,

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.160
and used in the field.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.759
Where is it?

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:13.439
What's Revelation 214?

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:19.250
When I used to get out going door to door, I still use that scripture along.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:26.769
Here it says, and he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more,

00:07:26.769 --> 00:07:29.889
neither will morning nor outcry, nor pain be anymore.

00:07:30.689 --> 00:07:33.810
The former things have passed away.

00:07:36.399 --> 00:07:42.079
Now, when that happens, we can say goodbye forever.

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:53.279
This kind of pain will never return by, by pain, out of sight, and felt no more.

00:07:53.279 --> 00:08:07.329
So the tree or bush producing the thorns has been uprooted and presently non-productive.

00:08:08.449 --> 00:08:10.370
Thank you, Jehovah.
