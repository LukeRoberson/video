00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:16.300
We have heard from many of you how much you have really appreciated JW News as a source

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.699
of accurate information.

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:24.480
In contrast with much of the misinformation posted on the internet and social media, Jehovah's

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.379
people serve as a pillar in support of the truth, as 1 Timothy 315 says.

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:34.939
But just what does it take to prepare a newsroom report?

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:39.859
Well, under the direction of the coordinators committee of the governing body, the office

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:46.619
of public information or OPI prepares articles for the JW Newsroom.

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:53.659
Now they work closely with public information desk or PIDs in our branch offices.

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:59.539
In the following report, some of these brothers share a behind-the-scenes look at how articles

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:09.150
in the last few years have been written and published on JW News.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.670
From the late 1960s to the late 1990s, Italian brothers were condemned and imprisoned for

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.829
refusing military service.

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:24.030
A recent survey revealed that more than 14,000 brothers from that group are still alive.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.909
They were sentenced to a total of almost 10,000 years in prison.

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.109
We thought that their experiences could make a potential story for the newsroom section

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:38.269
of JW Doorg, along with comments from secular sources.

00:01:38.269 --> 00:01:41.709
So we promptly notified OPI.

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:46.310
When we received that proposal, we agreed with their assessment.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.909
That's when we go into action.

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.829
We'll talk about the angle back and forth with PID until we have something that we know

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.510
will work not only for Italy, but for our worldwide audience on JW Doorg.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.790
Then we interviewed some brothers who had been imprisoned the longest.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.790
They had to face many challenges, but they also recalled how their loyalty was a great

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:14.389
witness, especially for some prison guards who eventually became JW's witnesses as well.

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:19.150
This additional information was confirmed and then added to the story.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.110
Then we sent the draft to OPI.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.229
Once the initial article is written by the branch, there's still quite a bit of work that

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:28.710
has to be done.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:35.069
We'll edit the article, select the photos, write the captions, send it through proofreading,

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.669
and then lastly, the article then is sent back to the coordinators committee for their

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:43.310
final review and approval.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.430
Shortly after the article was posted on JW Doorg, and the Italy PID informed their local

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:56.310
reporters, over 50 media outlets in Italy covered this story and wrote articles about

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.310
this topic.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.909
What our hope was that by publicizing this information, it would not only be encouraging

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:08.909
to our brothers and sisters, but it would have a positive impact on fair-minded officials

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:13.669
in other countries where our brothers are still dealing with this issue of neutrality.

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:19.710
2019 was the 25th anniversary of the genocide in Rwanda.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:25.789
So because of that, there was greater interest in the scholarly community in particular about

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:28.189
what happened during the genocide.

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:33.469
One of the things that OPI was responsible for doing is to collect experiences of people

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:37.909
who were our brothers and sisters who saw the violence and who survived and helped others

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:40.789
to survive sometimes at the risk of their own lives.

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:46.389
Our office assisted OPI in preparing the article in two ways.

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:52.710
First of all, ensuring that the release was accurate, secondly, to ensure that the article

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:58.430
gave consideration to the perspective of those who went through genocide.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.349
Many of the brothers have been able to read that story in JW News and it encouraged them

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:09.210
when they see the courage and the fate that our brothers displayed in Rwanda.

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.810
OPI has the privilege of assisting the brothers in Russia.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.290
We prepare news items on JW News.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.689
Once the trial begins, the team works together to prepare a JW News item.

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:27.569
We have to do lots of research on the brother or the sister's personal case history, where

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:30.689
they raided, where they put in pretrial detention.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:36.569
We can introduce the brother, the sister to the brotherhood, and then they can pray for them.

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:40.449
Once we've put together the material, we send it to the public information desk.

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:47.290
And on the day of the verdict, we post a breaking news to immediately alert the brotherhood.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.050
How can you make the best use of JW News?

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.850
Look for opportunities to share news items with your Bible students and others.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:01.649
Many of these reports show how Jehovah's people demonstrate love for one another.

00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:07.649
Another way is by praying for our brothers and sisters that we read about in the newsroom.

00:05:07.649 --> 00:05:13.410
We hope you continue to use the newsroom to stay informed, to be encouraged, and to remain

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.290
united with God's organization a pillar and support of the truth.
