00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:19.809
In my professional career, I thank Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:19.809 --> 00:00:23.809
They made a traditional doctor like myself

00:00:23.809 --> 00:00:27.809
consider the possibility and importance of reducing the use of blood.

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:31.809
I believe that you, know you as people,

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:33.810
but as a clinical setup,

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.810
have greatly changed my attitude

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.810
and thereby, also that of my collaborators.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.100
I have a lengthy clinical experience of over 30 years.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.100
And in my clinical experience, I have never had any such cases.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.100
Neither in my experience as a medical examiner,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.100
nor have my colleagues ever had them.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.100
I don't think it is correct to say that someone will die

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.100
because they didn't accept blood.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.099
It's an exceedingly complex situation

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:07.099
and should be considered on a case-by-case basis.

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:10.099
Blood, anyway, has risks,

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:13.099
so even a transfusion carries a high level of risk to the patient.

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:16.099
We have to evaluate risks versus benefits.

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:20.099
As a doctor, I believe that a patient who comes well prepared

00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:24.099
for a surgical operation or to give birth has a minimal risk.

00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:27.099
We can't exclude it, but then again,

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:30.099
we can't exclude a death following a transfusion.
