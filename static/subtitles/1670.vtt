00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.740
We would now like to introduce you to Sister Taerumi Ugura.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.740
This Japanese sister left a promising international career

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:17.390
to instead give of her energy to the true God.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.390
A road for racing.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.670
Bicycle racing against my rivals down a road.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.670
A road I traveled just for myself.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.670
That was my life course.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.750
I started road bicycle racing when I was a university student.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.420
I won practically every race in Japan.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.420
I won the Japan National Championship twice

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.420
and even participated in the Asian Games in the 1988 solo Olympics.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.420
Of course I was always happy when I won,

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:10.250
but that happiness didn't last very long.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.250
Every time I won a race, I would be expected to win the next one

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.250
and I was overwhelmed with tremendous pressure.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.250
That frightened me, so I immersed myself in training.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:31.579
Train, race, train, race.

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:37.180
I was racing down a road with no end in sight.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:44.799
After the solo Olympics, I was devoted to practice.

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:51.739
It was then that my younger sister, Rie,

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:53.739
who had become one of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:58.090
gave me the happiness book.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.090
I really agreed with what that book said.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.090
In 1989, I started to study the Bible seriously.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:15.069
Even so, I just wasn't able to believe in the existence of a creator,

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.069
so I studied the creation book.

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.069
When I read about the structure of bird's wings,

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.509
my eyes were opened.

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:28.509
I thought, there is a creator.

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:32.849
The creator made this.

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.849
When I was convinced of the existence of the creator,

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.849
I was able to understand the purpose of life.

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.849
It's just as Ecclesiastes 12 says.

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.849
The purpose of life is to know the creator and live for him.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.340
I was so relieved.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.340
In 1991, I dedicated my life to Jehovah

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.419
and started on the creator's road.

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:07.419
The following year, I started pioneering.

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:11.419
And my sister and I moved to a congregation where the need was greater.

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:17.539
But later, I was found to have kidney cancer.

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:23.539
And in 2005, I had to quit pioneering after 13 wonderful years.

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:28.229
I was really discouraged.

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:31.229
I could no longer do the things I had always done,

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:36.930
and it was difficult to keep myself respect.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.930
However, at that time, timely publications

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.930
and encouragement from the elders gave me good support,

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.930
so I tried to find joy in what I could do.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:54.169
Later, I got my strength back to some extent,

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:58.169
and I started pioneering again in 2012.

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:05.060
I was overjoyed to attend Pioneer Service School again.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:12.419
Jehovah really helped me to continue on this road.

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:16.420
In this system, we think we have a lot of time in our lives,

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.420
but in reality, we don't.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:24.660
People should live thinking about what is really important in life

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.660
in the time they have.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:33.740
Of course, we can learn from the things we experience.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.740
But the wise course is to learn from the truth

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.740
and from our relationship with our creator.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.740
I really want young people to learn that lesson.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:53.449
The road with real value is not the one we take for ourselves.

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:57.449
It is the road we take for the creator.
