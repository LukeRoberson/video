00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.920
With us today, we have Eugene and Odeel, Nasidaeio.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.920
They've graduated from the 145th class of Gilead,

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.920
and they lived through this mayhem.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.920
Odeel, now your family is tootsie.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.920
Now this must have certainly put them in danger.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.920
The killing was happening all over the country,

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.920
so my parents and my brother were killed.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.780
I saw that some religious readers

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.780
were involved in killing people in genocide.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.780
I couldn't believe how people who were previously living together friendly.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.780
Now they start killing their neighbors.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.780
How did you get contact with the truth?

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.780
After the genocide, I was taken by my aunt,

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.780
whose family were children of us witnesses,

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.780
so I began studying the Bible with them.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.780
I was in a live forever book.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.780
I saw a picture of a priest,

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.780
dressing people in the church,

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.780
and then he was dressing troops who were going to kill.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.780
But also I could see how brothers and sisters in the congregation

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.780
we love and courage,

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.780
this is their life to take care of one another.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.780
Oh, that's touching.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.780
Now Eugene, your family was not a direct target of the violence,

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.780
but what other hardships did you face?

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.780
The economic situation was very difficult.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.780
My family had no money,

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.780
and they could not buy food.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.780
I remember my mom,

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.780
I can still see her lying on the bed in complete despair,

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.780
not knowing what she can do for us children.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.780
She asked me to go to the kingdom hall.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.780
And when I arrived,

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.780
they handed me 18,000 wand and francs.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.780
The elders told me that my brothers and sisters from abroad

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.780
offered us this gift.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.780
So I immediately ran back home,

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.780
found my mom still lying on the bed.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.780
I gave her the money.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.780
I can still see my mom crying.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.780
Because of the joy and thankfulness of what the brothers had done.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.780
Excellent.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.780
Now, looking back at all the injustices you and your family have suffered,

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.780
Odeal, what has helped you to not become a bitter person?

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.780
The preaching work is very important to me,

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.780
because the more I talk about the Bible promises,

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.780
they become real to me.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.780
For example, when I talk about the resurrection hope,

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.780
the condition of the death,

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.780
this helped me to feel that my loved ones

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.780
are not suffering anymore,

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.780
and they are waiting to be resurrected.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.780
So this makes me feel happy.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.120
The scripture that comes to mind

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.120
is 1st John chapter 2 verse 6 and 7,

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.120
where the Apostle John repeated this Jesus command

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.120
loving one another just as Jesus loved us.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.120
Christians during that time were facing persecution,

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.120
and now they needed the fresh application of that scripture

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.120
in their lives.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.120
We all love one another,

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.120
but during difficult moments like the one our brothers and Randa went through,

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:19.120
they needed that fresh application of this very commandment of Jesus.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:28.120
Like loving one another to the point of risking our lives for our brothers.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.120
Being here in Gileand has reminded me of that fact

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:40.120
that I really need to love my brothers and sisters as Jesus loved us.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:47.120
You brothers and sisters in Rwanda have given us a wonderful example of courage and faith and love.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.120
Please know we love you all very much.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.120
Thank you.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.120
Thank you for joining us on this edition of Extraordinary Experiences.
