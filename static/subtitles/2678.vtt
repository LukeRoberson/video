00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:06.459
greetings and welcome to J.W. Broadcasting.

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:09.460
This month we'll learn what it means to be faithful

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.460
and how to make it our way of life.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.460
How can we remain faithful while enduring severe tests?

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:23.460
Maria Fernanda, Matias and Esteban each faced intense trials.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.460
They'll share how they found peace and comfort.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.460
Do you sometimes hesitate to offer a Bible study?

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:38.460
This episode of Iron Sharpen's Iron offers practical suggestions that will boost your confidence.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:46.460
And our new music video encourages young people to stay faithful and on the right path in life.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.460
This is J.W. Broadcasting.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:01:14.269
Old Faithful is the name of a geyser in Yellowstone National Park in the United States.

00:01:15.269 --> 00:01:20.269
The geyser was given this name because of the relative regularity of its eruptions.

00:01:20.269 --> 00:01:28.269
Today, it erupts thousands of liters or gallons of boiling water about every 90 minutes on average.

00:01:28.269 --> 00:01:37.269
After Old Faithful erupts, the timing of its next eruption can be predicted about 90% of the time within a 10 minute variation.

00:01:37.269 --> 00:01:41.269
And it's not even the most regular geyser in the park.

00:01:41.269 --> 00:01:43.269
Isn't that amazing?

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:53.519
It shouldn't surprise us that the word faithful is applied to inanimate things, since we see faithfulness and dependability in creation.

00:01:53.519 --> 00:02:02.519
For example, Psalm 8937 describes the moon as a faithful witness in the skies because of its reliability.

00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:13.860
Its appearance in the sky follows a fixed pattern, and it faithfully completes its orbit around the earth every 27.3 days.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:21.860
While we admire faithfulness and creation, we especially appreciate people who make faithfulness their way of life.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.860
Such individuals are reliable, dependable, and trustworthy.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.860
Let's read about this quality of faithfulness at 1 Corinthians 4-2.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.860
In this regard, what is expected of stewards is that they be found faithful.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.860
The term stored can mean house manager.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.860
His work could include caring for his master's business, property, and other servants.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.860
That's a lot of responsibility.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.860
But think of this.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:03:01.860
A stored might have many fine qualities and abilities, yet none of them would matter if he was irresponsible, disloyal, and unfaithful to his master.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.860
Faithfulness is essential to be an effective and successful stored.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.860
As true Christians, we must prove ourselves faithful and trustworthy.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.860
How does Jehovah feel about faithfulness?

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.860
In the same way as King David did, who wrote at Psalm 1016,

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.860
I will look to the faithful ones of the earth so that they may dwell with me.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:32.860
Using a similar expression, the prophet Jeremiah wrote the words found at Jeremiah 5-3.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.860
O Jehovah, do your eyes not look for faithfulness?

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:46.860
And Psalm 373 encourages us to reside in the earth and act with faithfulness.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:53.860
So the theme of this month's broadcast is, make faithfulness your way of life.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:03.620
We'll examine two examples of faithfulness, and then we'll consider some practical ways that we can prove ourselves faithful.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.620
We can our discussion by talking about the example of a geyser.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:16.620
A geyser might be a fitting symbol of the faithfulness of humans, because geysers continually erupt, but they do so unpredictably.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:27.620
So a geyser would be a poor representation of the unchanging faithfulness of our faithful creator, as Jehovah is described at 1 Peter 4-19.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:36.029
The ever-present sun and moon are more appropriate symbols of the unchangeableness of his faithfulness.

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:42.029
In his words to the nation of Israel, Moses stated as found at Deuteronomy 32-4,

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:52.029
the rock perfected his activity for all his ways or justice, a god of faithfulness who is never unjust.

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:57.029
Did Jehovah prove faithful to that nation? Of course he did.

00:04:57.029 --> 00:05:07.029
When Moses spoke those words to the Israelites, they may have remembered the time when Jehovah had faithfully brought their forefathers out of Egypt, and rescued them at the Red Sea.

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:17.029
He had faithfully preserved millions of people alive during the Israelites' 40-year journey in the wilderness, and he had led them to the border of the Promised Land.

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:22.029
Moses' successor Joshua also could testify to Jehovah's faithfulness.

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:31.029
As a child growing up in Egypt, Joshua must have come to know of Jehovah's promise to give the Israelites a land of their own.

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:38.029
When the time came to enter that land, Joshua was an eyewitness of how Jehovah fought in behalf of his people.

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:48.029
Joshua saw the walls of Jericho fall down flat. He saw the sun stand still until the amurites could be routed.

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:55.029
In time one nation after another was defeated, because the faithful god was fighting for Israel.

00:05:55.029 --> 00:06:03.439
Once they defeated their enemies, Joshua could say to the nation what is recorded at Joshua 23-14.

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:14.439
You well know with all your heart and with all your soul that not one word out of all the good promises that Jehovah your god has spoken to you has failed.

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:22.439
They have all come true for you, not one word of them has failed, not one word.

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:26.439
Joshua had seen that Jehovah faithfully kept his promises.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:35.720
Well, you can probably think of many other examples of Jehovah's faithfulness, such as the fulfillment of Messianic prophecies.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:44.720
The fulfillment of the promise to feed God's people spiritually in our day by means of the faithful and discrete slave, and so on.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.720
Jehovah sets the perfect example for us in showing faithfulness.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:07:00.290
The thought of making faithfulness our way of life can also be illustrated in the example of the three Hebrew companions of Daniel.

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:10.290
When they were young, Hanna Naya, Michelle, and Azaraya said an excellent example of faithfulness in what some people may view as a small thing.

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:15.290
Do you remember how they were pressured to eat unclean food?

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:24.290
Apparently, their faithful parents must have instructed them to adhere strictly to the dietary restrictions found in the Mosaic law.

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:33.290
Jehovah considered these so important that after listing such restrictions, he stated the words recorded at Leviticus 1145.

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:38.290
You must be holy, because I am holy.

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:49.290
The King of Babylon assigned the three Hebrew use and other young men a daily ration from his delicacies, among which were foods forbidden by the law.

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:59.290
The three Hebrews could have reasoned that the dietary restrictions of the Mosaic law were not so important, at least not when compared to the Ten Commandments.

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:06.290
But no, those faithful use were concerned with living up to all features of God's law.

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:13.290
They determined not to pollute themselves with such food and requested to eat vegetables.

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:20.819
The matter of which tasted better was of no concern to them in this important decision.

00:08:20.819 --> 00:08:24.819
Daniel asked that they be permitted to try out this diet for ten days.

00:08:24.819 --> 00:08:26.819
The result?

00:08:26.819 --> 00:08:31.819
At the end of the ten days, Jehovah blessed those young men for their faithfulness.

00:08:31.819 --> 00:08:36.820
They looked better and healthier than any of the other use.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.820
Was the choice of food a small thing?

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.820
Not to Jehovah.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:47.820
It was of serious concern to him, and the young Hebrews had his view of the matter.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:56.519
Their faithfulness in what may have seemed a small thing, prepared them for a bigger trial in the future.

00:08:56.519 --> 00:09:03.519
Hananiah, Michelle, and Aziraya had already established a pattern of making faithfulness their way of life,

00:09:03.519 --> 00:09:10.519
when King Nebuchadnezzar ordered them to bow before an image of gold on the plains of Dora.

00:09:10.519 --> 00:09:14.519
In faithfulness to Jehovah, they refused.

00:09:14.519 --> 00:09:21.519
And they made that decision, despite knowing that it would result in their being thrown into a fiery furnace.

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:27.519
As we read their words to the King, as recorded at Daniel 3, 17, and 18,

00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:31.519
see if you can sense their faithfulness.

00:09:31.519 --> 00:09:41.519
If it must be, our God whom we serve is able to rescue us from the burning fiery furnace, O King, and to rescue us from your hand.

00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:48.519
But even if he does not, let it be known to you, O King, that we will not serve your gods,

00:09:48.519 --> 00:09:53.519
or worship the image of gold that you have set up.

00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:57.519
That courageous stand resulted in their being thrown into the furnace.

00:09:57.519 --> 00:10:00.519
But as we know, Jehovah rescued them.

00:10:00.519 --> 00:10:05.519
What an outstanding witness they provided not only to the King and his court,

00:10:05.519 --> 00:10:11.519
but also to all those who through the centuries have read about that account in the book of Daniel.

00:10:12.519 --> 00:10:20.519
The three Hebrews looked at Jehovah as their sovereign, and they proved themselves faithful in both large and small matters.

00:10:20.519 --> 00:10:29.830
Well, how can we imitate Jehovah and the three Hebrews so that we too can make faithfulness our way of life?

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:33.830
Jesus' statement, recorded at Luke 1610, can help.

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:35.830
He said,

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:40.830
The person faithful in what is least is faithful also in much.

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:45.830
Those words uttered almost 2,000 years ago are still as true as ever.

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:54.210
Now, it may be that you'll never be asked to take a stand that demonstrates what some might view as outstanding faithfulness,

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:59.210
as was shown by the three Hebrews when they didn't bow down to the image.

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:06.210
But your constancy in doing what is right, your reliability and dependability in small things,

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:11.210
gives evidence of your deep appreciation for what it means to be faithful.

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:17.210
Psalm 3123 assures us that Jehovah protects the faithful,

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:22.210
and this is true even when we're faithful and seemingly small matters.

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:28.460
There are many areas of our lives in which we need to display faithfulness to Jehovah.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:35.460
For example, having a regular share in the ministry each month and reporting our participation.

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:40.460
Faithfulness to our marriagemate is very important to Jehovah.

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:47.460
How about showing our faithfulness by staying neutral with regard to the political and social conflicts of the world?

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:54.740
Do we make faithfulness our way of life when it comes to our personal conduct each day?

00:11:54.740 --> 00:12:01.740
During a personal study session or family worship, why not consider how you can continue to be faithful in these areas?

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:05.980
And what about you young ones?

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.980
We're so proud of you when you prove your faithfulness to Jehovah.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:18.980
We know that many of you face tests of your faith that involve the pressure to engage in immorality and in other forms of bad behavior.

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:23.980
It's one thing to know what to do or what choice you should make,

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:31.360
but quite another to have the courage to do what is right when you're under pressure or temptation.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:41.360
The three Hebrews could have concluded that they could get away with eating the food God's law prohibited since they were far away from their parents and friends.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:48.360
They could also have reason that it was the King's order, so they had no choice but to do what they were told.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:55.360
Besides, other Jews may have readily accepted the food arrangements and viewed it as a privilege.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:03.360
But the Hebrew Jews knew that, as mentioned in Proverbs 153, the eyes of Jehovah are everywhere.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:07.360
Those Jews were determined to remain faithful.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:18.740
Young ones, if you learn to deal successfully with trials that some may view as small things, then you'll be able to face bigger tests of your faith.

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:26.740
Never forget that the benefits of faithfulness far outweigh any temporary relief that comes from compromising.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:34.399
Let's consider one more area that involves faithfulness, our dress and grooming.

00:13:34.399 --> 00:13:44.399
How glad we were to learn in the 2024 governing body update number two of the adjustments to our standard of dress at theocratic events and in the ministry.

00:13:45.399 --> 00:13:53.399
We commend you brothers and sisters for wanting to dress and be groomed in a dignified way on those occasions.

00:13:53.399 --> 00:14:04.399
But how can we show our faithfulness and our selection of clothing during our leisure time, when on vacation, or when at social gatherings with our fellow Christians?

00:14:05.399 --> 00:14:21.399
First Timothy 2.9 and 10 admonishes our Christian sisters to adorn themselves in appropriate dress, with modesty and soundness of mind, in the way that is proper for women professing devotion to God.

00:14:21.399 --> 00:14:26.399
Of course, the principle of modesty applies to Christian brothers too.

00:14:26.399 --> 00:14:37.399
Also, second Corinthians 6, 3, and 4 states that in no way are we giving any cause for stumbling so that no fault may be found with our ministry.

00:14:37.399 --> 00:14:47.399
But in every way we recommend ourselves as God's ministers, in every way includes our choice of dressing grooming.

00:14:47.399 --> 00:14:57.970
An article entitled, Are You Faithful in All Things in the July 15, 2005 issue of the Watchtower states this.

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:05.970
Our dress needs to be practical and presentable. This serves as a witness to others who observe us.

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:10.970
In fact, we should always be appropriately attired.

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:22.970
To some, faithfulness in the choice of clothing may seem to be a small matter. But in God's eyes, it is important.

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:32.570
We should remember this when it comes to our choice of dressing grooming. Well, what will you remember from this consideration?

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:41.570
Most of us admire faithfulness in creation. However, we especially appreciate people who have made faithfulness their way of life.

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:51.570
We have outstanding examples of faithfulness recorded in the Bible that we can imitate, such as Jehovah, the Three Hebrews, and many others.

00:15:51.570 --> 00:16:01.570
The principle found at Luke 16-10 can help us to be faithful not only in large matters, but also in what some may regard as small matters.

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:09.570
Brothers and sisters, we encourage you to continue to prove your faithfulness to Jehovah.

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:25.570
As noted at Proverbs 28-20, a faithful man will receive many blessings. Of course, our main reason for being faithful is not because of what we get out of it, but because of our love for Jehovah.

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:35.840
And we can be sure that Jehovah will continue to bless us richly if we make faithfulness our way of life.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:39.840
Jesus displayed unmatched faithfulness through all that he suffered.

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:49.840
In our first segment, notice how his words and example helped Maria Fernanda, Matias, and Esteban during their darkest moments.

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:11.339
We were spending the afternoon in the pool with my family. The next day, I woke up and I was having trouble catching my breath, so we went to the doctor.

00:17:11.339 --> 00:17:24.500
A blood test revealed that I had a bacterial infection in my leg called Staphylococcus. I ended up in the hospital for 55 days.

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:35.960
I had a colonoscopy, and a few days later, they told me I had colon cancer.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:39.960
They ran some more tests and discovered it had also spread to my liver.

00:17:48.619 --> 00:17:53.619
He was a very humble person, caring. Yes.

00:17:58.089 --> 00:18:06.089
He loved Jehovah very much. He was a good companion and a great friend. We were married for almost 25 years.

00:18:06.089 --> 00:18:21.089
Honestly, I don't know why, but he decided to take his own life. I never thought that he would choose to do something like that.

00:18:21.089 --> 00:18:37.160
I think a word that's even more terrifying than cancer is metastasis.

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:48.950
It was like being caught up in a whirlwind and then plummeting to the ground. My life as I knew it had now completely changed.

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:56.950
In total, there were 10 operations. The first four were the most difficult because there was a possibility that they would have to amputate my leg.

00:18:56.950 --> 00:19:05.950
Every morning, you wake up with an intense anxiety, like a weight on your chest, and you can't breathe.

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:14.029
At first, I thought that Jehovah was just letting all this happen and that he wasn't doing anything.

00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:30.029
If Jesus himself did not expect Jehovah to shield him from trials or to get him out of them, then I had no right to think, why is this happening to me?

00:19:30.029 --> 00:19:36.029
Actually, the correct thinking is the opposite. Why shouldn't it also be me?

00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:46.029
One day, the doctors came in with some papers saying that the judge had given them permission to operate on me and give me a blood transfusion that very day.

00:19:46.029 --> 00:19:51.029
Because I was still a minor at the time, I found that my opinion and my decisions were being ignored.

00:19:51.029 --> 00:19:59.029
So at that moment, I realized that all of this wasn't against me, but against Jehovah. It became clear to me that everything was in his hands.

00:19:59.029 --> 00:20:06.529
I see Jehovah's hands through my brothers and sisters who are always looking out for me.

00:20:06.529 --> 00:20:17.539
We decided to speak openly about it with others, but especially with our close friends. We wanted to tell them even before they asked.

00:20:17.539 --> 00:20:29.539
One scripture that others often shared with me says that Jehovah is a protector of widows. That was a constant reminder that Jehovah was going to take care of me, and he did.

00:20:29.539 --> 00:20:38.539
It was three months of chemotherapy, and then the operation. They told us the operation could last ten hours.

00:20:38.539 --> 00:20:51.539
One thing I remember thinking was, well, when I open my eyes, I will either see the ceiling of the operating room or I'll see the new world.

00:20:51.539 --> 00:21:02.980
When our family faced economic hardships, my mom made fruit jams to sell. So I said, well, I guess I need to do the same.

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:12.980
A sister who had a business offered to sell them for me. This helped me so much because I'm not naturally gifted at doing sales.

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:21.980
While reviewing the legal order, it turned out that it contained an error. My last name is Canal, and they added a nest to it.

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:26.980
So they weren't able to use the document that ordered the transfusion that day.

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:34.980
At this time, I began to recover, and I started feeling reassured by the fact that I had not been judging Jehovah by asking where he was.

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:42.559
Asking that question was a sign that I needed his help.

00:21:42.559 --> 00:21:56.509
Whenever anything worries me, I tell myself, wait, Jehovah has always cared for you. So he's not going to stop now. I have full confidence that Jehovah will take care of me.

00:21:56.509 --> 00:22:06.509
The physical health is now the best it can be. In my spiritual condition with Jehovah, my friendship with him has been greatly strengthened.

00:22:06.509 --> 00:22:14.509
We've definitely experienced more good things than bad things. It's not that we will want to go through it all again. Absolutely not.

00:22:14.509 --> 00:22:25.509
But the reality is that in hindsight, with everything I learned about Jehovah, I don't know that I would have learned these things, had I not gone through a situation like this.

00:22:25.509 --> 00:22:46.470
If you're facing a hardship or trial, remember you're not alone. Never hesitate to ask for help.

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:56.720
You too can count on Jehovah's loving support to endure and remain faithful. Jehovah's love moves us to help others come to know him.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:01.720
Offering a Bible study is one of the best ways to do this.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:13.720
Sometimes, though, we may feel unsure or uncomfortable. In this episode of Iron Sharpen's Iron, we'll learn how to offer a Bible study with confidence.

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:30.619
Hello, I'm Byeongchuliam. Welcome to Iron Sharpen's Iron. Have you ever had this experience?

00:23:30.619 --> 00:23:37.619
You share the truth with someone and you can see that it touches their heart. It's the best feeling, isn't it?

00:23:37.619 --> 00:23:44.619
And it makes you want to take the initiative to offer them a Bible study. After all, we love God and people.

00:23:44.619 --> 00:23:53.619
But, at times, we may hesitate to offer a study. We might worry about something pushy or being rejected.

00:23:53.619 --> 00:23:58.619
So, what can we do to effectively offer a Bible study?

00:24:05.089 --> 00:24:09.089
Hi, you're out to exercise again today. You're really diligent.

00:24:09.089 --> 00:24:18.089
I've got to do at least this much to stay healthy. But hey, look at this news. I said so a few months ago, didn't I?

00:24:18.089 --> 00:24:21.089
Why is the world such a mess?

00:24:21.089 --> 00:24:25.089
True, but don't you think the world will get better someday?

00:24:25.089 --> 00:24:30.089
What do you think? Can the world's problems be solved by people's efforts?

00:24:30.089 --> 00:24:33.089
If anything, it'll get worse. What can people do?

00:24:33.089 --> 00:24:37.089
Well, if people are powerless, do you think there's another way?

00:24:37.089 --> 00:24:41.089
Another way? Hmm. Doesn't seem likely.

00:24:41.089 --> 00:24:46.170
Our brother did an excellent job.

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:52.170
He showed personal interest, was a good listener, and asked appropriate questions.

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:54.170
But, can you guess what he did next?

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:58.170
He offered a brief, silent prayer to Jehovah for help.

00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:02.170
When offering a Bible study, prayer is the first step.

00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:06.170
Even if the fear of rejection makes you hesitate?

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:10.170
If you pray for courage as Philippians 2.13 tells us to do,

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:16.170
Jehovah will give you both the desire and the power to act, and will bless your efforts.

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:21.170
So, even if you feel hesitant to speak up, don't give up.

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:26.170
Pause, pray, and turn your thoughts into actions.

00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:32.930
Actually, the Bible tells us about the solution.

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:34.930
Here, let me show you.

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:42.490
Under God's Kingdom, peaceful abound.

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:48.490
God's Kingdom. Sounds like a possible solution.

00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:51.490
But now, I've got a lot of questions.

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:56.490
Right. I had a lot of questions, too.

00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:59.490
But I found the answers by studying the Bible.

00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:02.490
It's the best way. Really?

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:05.490
Studying the Bible? Yes.

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:12.490
Some people might think a Bible study involves attending classes with many others or taking exams.

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:15.490
How can we avoid this misunderstanding?

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:17.490
This is the second step.

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:20.490
Demonstrate how a Bible study is conducted.

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:25.900
Showing them this video from the Teaching Toolbox in JW Library,

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:29.900
not only answers frequently asked questions about Bible studies,

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:34.900
but is also one of the best ways to help them want to study the Bible.

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:37.900
You also study the Bible like this? Yes.

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:40.900
I really enjoyed studying the Bible.

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:44.900
Video said the future becomes brighter if you study the Bible.

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:50.430
So, how does it become brighter? Like this.

00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:53.430
Enjoy life forever?

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:56.430
You can watch the video together,

00:26:56.430 --> 00:27:01.430
and then show them the back cover of the enjoy life forever brochure.

00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:03.430
If they respond positively,

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:08.430
you can build their anticipation by moving on to the third step.

00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:11.430
This involves finding out what they are interested in.

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:15.430
To do this, show them page 15 of the brochure

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:18.430
and ask them to choose a topic that interests them.

00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:21.430
This one. How to find real peace?

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:24.430
Yes, peace is really important.

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:29.430
Then how about we explore this topic together for our first Bible study?

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:32.430
Sounds good. What time works for you?

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:35.430
The brother did an excellent job of starting a Bible study.

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:37.430
So, let us review.

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:40.430
To offer a Bible study, there are three steps.

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:42.430
The first is prayer.

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:45.430
You might feel hesitant about offering a Bible study,

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:50.430
but Jehovah can give you both the desire and the power to do so.

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:55.430
The second is to demonstrate how a Bible study is conducted.

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:58.430
We have effective tools that help us to do this.

00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:02.430
For example, you can use what happens at a Bible study video

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:05.430
and the enjoy life forever brochure.

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:09.430
The third is to find out the other person's interests.

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:14.430
Use page 15 of the brochure to find out which topics interest them.

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:21.430
But remember, the more important than any method or technique

00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:27.430
is showing genuine love for God and people, just as Jesus did.

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:33.430
This will no doubt help you to achieve your goal of making disciples.

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:37.430
After what we've explored together today,

00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:41.430
I feel motivated to go out and start a Bible study.

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:44.430
I hope you also feel the same way.

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:47.430
What practical suggestions?

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:52.430
Let's look for ways to apply them in our daily interactions with people.

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:55.430
When we stay alert in our conversations,

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:59.430
we'll find opportunities to offer Bible studies.

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:06.970
More than ever, people urgently need to learn about Jehovah and his purpose for mankind.

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:10.970
The knowledge they gain can truly transform their lives

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:13.970
as we'll see in the story of Moses Mapoto.

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:22.160
One night, the police came into our home.

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:27.160
They kicked open the doors and they broke the windows.

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:41.410
They told us that they were taking the house that it was no longer ours.

00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:45.410
After that incident, I became an angry person.

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:52.410
I was angry and I told myself that I would do anything to find justice and freedom.

00:29:55.519 --> 00:29:58.519
A partite caused divisions among people.

00:29:58.519 --> 00:30:04.519
For example, there was education meant for white people and education meant for black people.

00:30:04.519 --> 00:30:10.519
The education for black people was of a very low standard.

00:30:10.519 --> 00:30:16.519
When the government made a budget, most of that money was going to white people.

00:30:16.519 --> 00:30:21.519
Even in the classrooms, the black students classrooms were overcrowded

00:30:21.519 --> 00:30:24.519
compared to the white students classrooms.

00:30:24.519 --> 00:30:28.519
While I was growing up, I was determined to become a lawyer

00:30:28.519 --> 00:30:33.519
so that I would be able to fight a partite legally.

00:30:33.519 --> 00:30:37.519
After that cruel incident and that harsh treatment,

00:30:37.519 --> 00:30:40.519
my view changed immediately.

00:30:40.519 --> 00:30:45.519
And I wanted an immediate solution that would help us find peace,

00:30:45.519 --> 00:30:48.519
find freedom, and find justice.

00:30:48.519 --> 00:30:53.799
I went on to join a political organization.

00:30:53.799 --> 00:31:00.799
I agreed to cross the border where I was being trained in the military.

00:31:00.799 --> 00:31:05.799
The political organization made me a military commander of soldiers

00:31:05.799 --> 00:31:08.799
that were fighting for freedom.

00:31:08.799 --> 00:31:18.779
My responsibility as a commander was to establish cells

00:31:19.779 --> 00:31:24.779
where we could store our weapons for war

00:31:24.779 --> 00:31:33.180
and to train others who came to join that organization.

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:37.180
We were training them in guerrilla warfare,

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:43.180
showing them how to use guns or different explosives

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:45.180
that we stored in those cells.

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:50.430
I was a very cruel person who did not respect anyone

00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:54.680
who was not afraid of anything.

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:59.680
I was not happy because I expected that as one organization

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:04.680
we would be united because we had the same purpose.

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:12.220
In my experience, there was hatred, there was prejudice,

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:14.220
there was quarreling.

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:20.009
My wife was already one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:32:20.009 --> 00:32:23.009
We agreed that she should find someone

00:32:23.009 --> 00:32:27.009
who would teach me about the Bible.

00:32:27.009 --> 00:32:31.009
That sister came and started telling me

00:32:31.009 --> 00:32:35.319
about the good news of God's Kingdom.

00:32:35.319 --> 00:32:40.319
But things turned sour when she said that this Kingdom of God

00:32:40.319 --> 00:32:43.319
will crush all these other kingdoms,

00:32:43.319 --> 00:32:49.549
including my political organization.

00:32:49.549 --> 00:32:52.549
I was furious as I was talking to her,

00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:56.549
but I saw that she was just smiling, not shouting,

00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:58.549
not even retaliating.

00:32:58.549 --> 00:33:00.549
I was surprised.

00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:04.660
It touched my heart.

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:07.660
They invited me to the Kingdom Hall.

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:12.660
What really got my attention is that everywhere I looked,

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:15.660
everyone in the hall was participating.

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:18.660
Little children were raising their hands,

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:21.660
giving their answers freely.

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:24.660
You could see they were well prepared

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:26.660
and stayed on the topic.

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:30.660
Each and every one of them found scriptures quickly.

00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:32.660
I was a university student,

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:35.660
but I was unable to find the scriptures.

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:39.660
That made me think, hey, I want to be the same as them.

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:43.660
I noticed that the kind of education that they were receiving

00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:47.660
in Jehovah's Organization was of a high standard,

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:50.660
compared to what we receive under Partite,

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:55.009
which was of a very low standard.

00:33:55.009 --> 00:33:57.009
From my experience,

00:33:57.009 --> 00:34:02.009
it is clear that trusting in people is chasing the wind,

00:34:02.009 --> 00:34:07.009
but putting trust in Jehovah God brings people happiness.

00:34:07.009 --> 00:34:10.769
Since I was young,

00:34:10.769 --> 00:34:13.769
I just wanted to find freedom,

00:34:13.769 --> 00:34:17.769
find peace, and become a happy person.

00:34:17.769 --> 00:34:23.340
But I could not find it until I came into the Kingdom Hall.

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:26.340
That is where I found real freedom.

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:28.340
I found real justice.

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:30.340
I had real happiness,

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:36.130
and I was shown what real love is.

00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:38.130
My life has changed tremendously.

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:43.789
I have a close relationship with Jehovah.

00:34:43.789 --> 00:34:47.789
That relationship caused me to become a loving person,

00:34:47.789 --> 00:34:50.789
a person who is empathetic,

00:34:50.789 --> 00:34:54.789
someone who strives hard to be humble,

00:34:54.789 --> 00:34:58.789
someone who lives with people in peace.

00:34:58.789 --> 00:35:03.789
I close myself completely with the new personality.

00:35:03.789 --> 00:35:13.219
Moses yearned for two things,

00:35:13.219 --> 00:35:15.219
justice and unity,

00:35:15.219 --> 00:35:19.219
and learned that God's Kingdom offers the true solution.

00:35:19.219 --> 00:35:25.429
God's Word also contains principles that foster peace

00:35:25.429 --> 00:35:28.429
in our personal relationships, starting at home.

00:35:28.429 --> 00:35:31.429
In the following dramatization,

00:35:31.429 --> 00:35:35.429
note how regular Bible reading promotes peace within marriage.

00:35:35.429 --> 00:36:03.000
In a marriage,

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:37.849
not applying Bible principles can lead to a lack of peace,

00:36:37.849 --> 00:36:40.849
as time passes.

00:36:40.849 --> 00:36:46.289
The differences in opinion and personality that arise

00:36:46.289 --> 00:36:52.329
can undermine the peace you once had.

00:36:52.329 --> 00:36:59.820
How can that peace so long for be regained?

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:02.820
Isaiah chapter 26 and verse 3 says,

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:06.820
You will safeguard those who fully lean on you.

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:09.820
You will give them continuous peace

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:14.579
because it is in you that they trust.

00:37:14.579 --> 00:37:17.579
Only Jehovah can give continuous peace

00:37:17.579 --> 00:37:20.579
to those who fully lean on him.

00:37:20.579 --> 00:37:22.579
Abraham and Sarah, for example,

00:37:22.579 --> 00:37:26.579
had that peace because even during big life changes

00:37:26.579 --> 00:37:28.579
and difficult situations,

00:37:28.579 --> 00:37:31.579
they faithfully followed Jehovah's direction.

00:37:31.579 --> 00:37:47.130
We can demonstrate our trust in Jehovah.

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:51.130
By searching out His advice and His Word,

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:59.019
the Bible, burning Bible reading into a habit,

00:37:59.019 --> 00:38:01.019
can seem daunting,

00:38:01.019 --> 00:38:04.019
but it's worth the effort.

00:38:04.019 --> 00:38:07.019
Take advantage of every opportunity.

00:38:07.019 --> 00:38:12.019
See where you can make adjustments in your routine.

00:38:12.019 --> 00:38:17.019
The advice found in the Bible can lead to peace in your marriage.

00:38:17.019 --> 00:38:21.019
For example, Matthew chapter 7 and verse 12 says,

00:38:21.019 --> 00:38:25.019
All things therefore that you want men to do to you,

00:38:25.019 --> 00:38:41.909
you also must do to them.

00:38:41.909 --> 00:38:46.909
But after reading, don't forget the most important steps.

00:38:46.909 --> 00:38:49.909
Apply what you learn.

00:38:49.909 --> 00:38:52.909
When a husband puts his wife's interest ahead of his own,

00:38:52.909 --> 00:39:11.059
she feels loved and valued and vice versa.

00:39:11.059 --> 00:39:16.059
Another Bible principle found at Matthew chapter 5 and verse 5 says,

00:39:16.059 --> 00:39:19.059
Happy are the mild tempered.

00:39:19.059 --> 00:39:32.070
By controlling our temper,

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:37.070
we create an environment that is relaxed and peaceful.

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:45.429
And while all are encouraged to read the Bible as individuals,

00:39:45.429 --> 00:39:50.429
if circumstances allow, consider doing so as a couple.

00:39:50.429 --> 00:39:52.429
Talk about what you learned.

00:39:52.429 --> 00:39:56.710
Take advantage of the available study tools

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:59.710
to learn all you can about Jehovah's marvelous qualities

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:04.980
without a doubt.

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:07.980
This will draw you closer to Jehovah

00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:12.980
and will strengthen a threefold cord in your marriage.

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:51.010
And even when life takes a turn and things get hard,

00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:59.139
you will still be able to feel the continuous peace

00:40:59.139 --> 00:41:04.139
that only Jehovah, the originator of marriage, can provide.

00:41:04.139 --> 00:41:12.809
If it's convenient to talk privately with your spouse,

00:41:12.809 --> 00:41:24.210
why not pause this video and discuss these three questions?

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:28.210
The dramatization was both realistic and encouraging.

00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:31.210
When husbands and wives read the Bible regularly,

00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:35.210
together and on their own and apply what they learn,

00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:38.210
they bring continuous peace into the home.

00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:43.219
The Bible not only provides timeless principles,

00:41:43.219 --> 00:41:48.219
but also examples of real people whose lives we can learn from.

00:41:48.219 --> 00:41:54.219
One of these is Job, who teaches us timeless lessons about integrity.

00:41:54.219 --> 00:42:00.219
That's the focus of this morning worship presented by Brother Robert Cerenco.

00:42:00.219 --> 00:42:02.219
Did you know that in the Bible,

00:42:02.219 --> 00:42:07.219
Jehovah accretts just two of his worshipers as having integrity?

00:42:07.219 --> 00:42:09.219
David and Job.

00:42:09.219 --> 00:42:12.219
Regarding David at 1 Kings 9-4,

00:42:12.219 --> 00:42:14.219
Jehovah told Solomon,

00:42:14.219 --> 00:42:20.219
Walk before me as your father David walked with integrity of heart.

00:42:20.219 --> 00:42:24.219
And twice when speaking of Satan, Jehovah said of Job,

00:42:24.219 --> 00:42:26.219
there is no one like him on the earth.

00:42:26.219 --> 00:42:29.219
He is an upright man of integrity.

00:42:29.219 --> 00:42:33.219
Of course, the Bible is filled with other examples of men and women

00:42:33.219 --> 00:42:35.219
who had similar reputations.

00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:39.219
We can think of Abraham, Daniel and his three companions,

00:42:39.219 --> 00:42:43.219
and all the ones that Paul listed in Hebrews chapter 11,

00:42:43.219 --> 00:42:49.219
just a few, and of course the finest example of all is Jesus Christ.

00:42:49.219 --> 00:42:55.219
Clearly, Jehovah takes note of, values and loves people with integrity,

00:42:55.219 --> 00:43:00.219
which is a quality that every faithful servant of God needs.

00:43:00.219 --> 00:43:04.219
But exactly what is that quality?

00:43:04.219 --> 00:43:07.219
Well, integrity is moral soundness,

00:43:07.219 --> 00:43:10.219
an unswerving devotion to righteousness.

00:43:10.219 --> 00:43:15.219
Having integrity means having strong ethical and moral principles

00:43:15.219 --> 00:43:18.219
and following those principles at all times.

00:43:18.219 --> 00:43:23.219
We could say that such people do the right thing even when that is not easy

00:43:23.219 --> 00:43:25.219
and no one is watching.

00:43:25.219 --> 00:43:31.219
In fact, integrity is most evident when a person's devotion is under test

00:43:31.219 --> 00:43:35.219
and he is pressured to abandon the right course.

00:43:35.219 --> 00:43:39.219
Now, how does a person develop integrity?

00:43:39.219 --> 00:43:44.219
Well, it all starts with defining one's core values.

00:43:44.219 --> 00:43:47.219
That is, the values that no matter what the consequences,

00:43:47.219 --> 00:43:50.219
we are not going to compromise them.

00:43:50.219 --> 00:43:54.219
And in this, Job is an excellent example.

00:43:54.219 --> 00:43:57.219
What were his core values?

00:43:57.219 --> 00:44:02.219
Well, we don't have to wonder. Turn to Job chapter 1 verse 1.

00:44:02.219 --> 00:44:06.219
It says, there was a man in the land of us whose name was Job.

00:44:06.219 --> 00:44:09.219
He was an upright man of integrity.

00:44:09.219 --> 00:44:13.219
He feared God and shunned what was bad.

00:44:13.219 --> 00:44:16.219
Those were Job's core values.

00:44:16.219 --> 00:44:20.219
He had a reverent, deep respect for Jehovah

00:44:20.219 --> 00:44:24.219
and a wholesome dread of disobeying him.

00:44:24.219 --> 00:44:29.219
And that was right in line with what Solomon wrote hundreds of years later

00:44:29.219 --> 00:44:32.219
in Ecclesiastes chapter 12 verse 13.

00:44:32.219 --> 00:44:37.219
If you'd like to look at that, Ecclesiastes 12, 13.

00:44:37.219 --> 00:44:40.219
The conclusion of the matter, everything having been heard is,

00:44:40.219 --> 00:44:43.219
fear the true God and keep His commandments,

00:44:43.219 --> 00:44:47.219
for this is the whole obligation of man.

00:44:47.219 --> 00:44:50.219
Or as a modern paraphrase puts it,

00:44:50.219 --> 00:44:54.219
fear God, duty tells you.

00:44:54.219 --> 00:44:57.219
In the text comments for today, the Watchtower states,

00:44:57.219 --> 00:45:02.219
for servants of Jehovah, the key to integrity is love for God.

00:45:02.219 --> 00:45:07.219
And it adds that along with that must be our loyal devotion to Him

00:45:07.219 --> 00:45:09.219
as our Heavenly Father.

00:45:09.219 --> 00:45:13.219
Humans show integrity when they are so completely devoted to God

00:45:13.219 --> 00:45:18.219
that they continue to do His will when facing hardship.

00:45:18.219 --> 00:45:23.219
Why even in His worst moment, Job refused to turn against God

00:45:23.219 --> 00:45:30.219
and that is why He said, until I die, I will not renounce my integrity.

00:45:30.219 --> 00:45:34.219
Each of us has the responsibility and the privilege just like Job

00:45:34.219 --> 00:45:40.219
to demonstrate that we serve in obey Jehovah because we love Him.

00:45:40.219 --> 00:45:43.219
Interestingly, in Job chapter 31,

00:45:43.219 --> 00:45:47.219
Job lists about a dozen real life examples

00:45:47.219 --> 00:45:49.219
that if they had been true of Him,

00:45:49.219 --> 00:45:53.219
would have exposed a lack of integrity on his part.

00:45:53.219 --> 00:45:57.219
Let's look at just a few of these and in doing so,

00:45:57.219 --> 00:46:01.219
it can help us to see what we can do to keep our integrity.

00:46:01.219 --> 00:46:04.219
Starting with verse 9 of Job 31,

00:46:04.219 --> 00:46:09.219
he said, if my heart has been enticed by a woman.

00:46:09.219 --> 00:46:12.219
In verse 11, he said, that would be shameful conduct

00:46:12.219 --> 00:46:16.219
and error deserving judgment by the judges.

00:46:16.219 --> 00:46:19.219
We know Job kept himself clean from immorality

00:46:19.219 --> 00:46:21.219
because in verse 1 of that same chapter,

00:46:21.219 --> 00:46:23.219
he said he had made a covenant with his eyes

00:46:23.219 --> 00:46:27.219
not to show improper attention to another woman.

00:46:27.219 --> 00:46:30.219
So he not only avoided committing adultery,

00:46:30.219 --> 00:46:34.219
but he had not even taken the first step toward that sin

00:46:34.219 --> 00:46:37.219
by looking lustfully at other women.

00:46:37.219 --> 00:46:42.219
So people of integrity uphold Jehovah's standard of morality

00:46:42.219 --> 00:46:45.219
and the sanctity of marriage.

00:46:45.219 --> 00:46:47.219
Another example is in verse 16,

00:46:47.219 --> 00:46:51.219
he said, if I refuse to give the poor what they desired.

00:46:51.219 --> 00:46:55.219
And in verse 17, he included the need to share his food

00:46:55.219 --> 00:46:57.219
with the orphans.

00:46:57.219 --> 00:47:00.219
Well, we know Job was generous to the poor in needy

00:47:00.219 --> 00:47:04.219
because at Job 2912, he said he would rescue the poor,

00:47:04.219 --> 00:47:08.219
the fatherless child, and anyone who had no helper.

00:47:08.219 --> 00:47:11.219
So people of integrity value others and help those

00:47:11.219 --> 00:47:14.219
who are in need and they look after orphans

00:47:14.219 --> 00:47:16.219
and widows.

00:47:16.219 --> 00:47:19.219
Another example, verse 24, he said,

00:47:19.219 --> 00:47:22.219
if I put my confidence in gold,

00:47:22.219 --> 00:47:25.219
Job was wealthy at the start,

00:47:25.219 --> 00:47:28.219
but he was not greedily materialistic.

00:47:28.219 --> 00:47:31.219
And when he lost all his wealth,

00:47:31.219 --> 00:47:33.219
he accepted the fact that as he said,

00:47:33.219 --> 00:47:35.219
naked he came out of his mother's womb

00:47:35.219 --> 00:47:38.219
and naked he would return.

00:47:38.219 --> 00:47:40.219
So people of integrity did not put their trust

00:47:40.219 --> 00:47:42.219
in material things.

00:47:42.219 --> 00:47:45.219
They put the kingdom first in their life.

00:47:45.219 --> 00:47:47.219
One more example, verse 33,

00:47:47.219 --> 00:47:50.219
he said, have I ever tried to cover

00:47:50.219 --> 00:47:53.219
over my transgressions?

00:47:53.219 --> 00:47:57.219
In Job 1323, Job asked for his sins

00:47:57.219 --> 00:48:00.219
and transgressions to be revealed.

00:48:00.219 --> 00:48:03.219
And in the end, he accepted reproof

00:48:03.219 --> 00:48:07.219
for his being too quick to declare himself righteous.

00:48:07.219 --> 00:48:11.219
And after Elihu and Jehovah both chasing Job,

00:48:11.219 --> 00:48:14.219
he repented in dust and ashes.

00:48:14.219 --> 00:48:16.219
So people of integrity are quick

00:48:16.219 --> 00:48:18.219
to own up to their own mistakes

00:48:18.219 --> 00:48:21.219
and accept correction.

00:48:21.219 --> 00:48:24.219
Surely Job was a model of integrity.

00:48:24.219 --> 00:48:26.219
Did you know that he requested

00:48:26.219 --> 00:48:28.219
that a written record be made

00:48:28.219 --> 00:48:31.219
of his suffering and endurance?

00:48:31.219 --> 00:48:34.219
He did, if you turn to Job chapter 19,

00:48:34.219 --> 00:48:39.219
Job 19, starting with verse 23,

00:48:39.219 --> 00:48:44.630
he said, if only my words were written down,

00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:47.630
if only they could be inscribed in a book,

00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:50.630
or that they were carved forever in the rock

00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:54.630
with an iron stylus and lead.

00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:56.630
How thankful we are that Jehovah agreed

00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:59.630
to make a permanent record of Job's integrity

00:48:59.630 --> 00:49:02.630
keeping course and that he put it in the Bible

00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:04.630
and did not have it cherished,

00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:06.630
chiseled on some rock

00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:09.630
in the middle of Arabia where Job lived.

00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:14.630
Can you sum up the story of Job in one sentence?

00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:19.630
Well, one Bible commentary does quite well by stating,

00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:21.630
the beauty of the book of Job is

00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:24.630
of a living, breathing soul,

00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:26.630
encompassed by sorrows,

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:28.630
surrounded by misunderstanding,

00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:31.630
but unconquered, humbled,

00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:35.630
and finally, satisfied in God.

00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:37.630
Through Job's life, we learn

00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:40.630
that no matter what trials we may encounter,

00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:42.630
having a close relationship with Jehovah

00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:46.630
and staying true to our core values,

00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:49.630
will enable us to maintain our integrity

00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:51.630
and that when we are tested,

00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:55.630
God will support us just as He did Job.

00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:57.630
Psalm 84 11 says,

00:49:57.630 --> 00:50:00.630
Jehovah will not hold back anything good

00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:03.630
from those walking in integrity.

00:50:03.630 --> 00:50:05.630
When we show our complete,

00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:08.630
wholehearted devotion to God by obeying Him

00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:10.630
and doing what is right in His eyes

00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:11.630
in our everyday lives,

00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:13.630
even when facing hardships,

00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:16.630
we will surely make Jehovah happy

00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:18.630
and frustrate His enemy Satan

00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:23.630
just as Job did so long ago.

00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:25.630
Like Job, you young ones

00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:28.630
have many opportunities to show your devotion

00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:31.630
to God through the choices you make.

00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:32.630
Our new music video,

00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:34.630
The Road to Life,

00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:36.630
will strengthen your conviction

00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:38.630
to stay close to Jehovah.

00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:52.130
It's hard to find your way.

00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:56.130
Decisions every day,

00:50:56.130 --> 00:50:58.130
who to be, what to love,

00:50:58.130 --> 00:51:01.130
where to put your trust.

00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:04.130
It's not easy to find your place,

00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:08.130
but I know how I feel,

00:51:08.130 --> 00:51:12.130
that Jehovah is free.

00:51:12.130 --> 00:51:45.269
If I fall off to life,

00:51:45.269 --> 00:51:46.269
once me to choose,

00:51:46.269 --> 00:51:50.130
Jehovah sees that too,

00:51:50.130 --> 00:53:21.949
to keep on love too.

00:53:21.949 --> 00:53:56.119
We've enjoyed a faith strengthening program.

00:53:56.119 --> 00:53:58.119
We learned how to find comfort

00:53:58.119 --> 00:54:01.119
despite severe tests of faith.

00:54:01.119 --> 00:54:04.119
How husbands and wives gain continuous peace

00:54:04.119 --> 00:54:08.400
by faithfully reading God's Word.

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:12.400
How everyday conversations may lead to Bible studies.

00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:15.400
And how studying the Bible can be life-changing,

00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:18.400
giving people hope.

00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:20.400
Before we say goodbye,

00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:22.400
it's time for our postcard.

00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:24.400
When you envision a paradise,

00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:27.400
you may think of pristine beaches,

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:29.400
swaying palm trees,

00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:30.400
rainforests,

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:33.400
and coral reefs teeming with life.

00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:36.400
You may picture Samoa.

00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:39.400
The Samoa and islands sparkle like gems

00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:42.400
in the South Pacific Ocean.

00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:44.400
The islands are divided into two parts,

00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:47.400
Samoa and American Samoa.

00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:50.400
Although separated by only about 65 kilometers

00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:52.400
or about 40 miles,

00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:54.400
they lie on either side

00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:56.400
of the international date line,

00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:59.400
creating a time difference of a full day.

00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:01.400
This means that each year,

00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:04.400
one of the first memorial talks is given in Samoa,

00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:09.400
while one of the last is held in American Samoa.

00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:12.400
The coconut tree is abundant here.

00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:16.400
Samoans call it the tree of life,

00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:18.400
because it can be used for food,

00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:20.400
drink, medicine,

00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.400
fuel, and shelter.

00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:24.400
In 1940,

00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:27.400
Harold Gill visited the Samoan islands to preach,

00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:30.400
but was promptly asked to leave.

00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:33.400
In the five days before the next boat sailed,

00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:37.400
he distributed literature far and wide by bicycle.

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:40.400
One booklet found its way to Pele Foyopolo.

00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:43.400
12 years later, in 1952,

00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:46.400
after Pele met a brother from England at work,

00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:48.400
he and his wife, Ilua,

00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:52.400
became the first Samoans to be baptized.

00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:54.400
Today, there are 12 congregations

00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:58.400
with 606 publishers in Samoa.

00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:01.400
Brothers at the remote translation office

00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:03.400
on the island of Upoğlu

00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:06.400
translate publications into Samoan.

00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:08.400
Witnesses can be found preaching and appear.

00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:10.400
Samoans main port,

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:14.400
but most Samoans live in rural coastal areas.

00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:17.400
So our brothers witness in villages,

00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:18.400
tarot plantations,

00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:20.400
and the remote island of Manono,

00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:23.400
reachable only by boat.

00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:25.400
With no cars on Manono,

00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:30.400
publishers walk the island in search of interested ones.

00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:33.400
When our brothers get together for association,

00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:35.400
they enjoy delicious foods,

00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:36.400
including tarot,

00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:37.400
breadfruit,

00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:38.400
coconut milk,

00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:39.400
oka,

00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:41.400
which is raw fish in coconut cream,

00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:44.400
and their famous hot chocolate,

00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:47.400
Koko Samoa.

00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:48.400
On Sundays,

00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:50.400
families spend hours together

00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:52.400
enjoying a feast of foods

00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:54.400
cooked in a traditional umu.

00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:58.400
An above ground oven made of volcanic rock.

00:56:58.400 --> 00:56:59.400
They enjoy music,

00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:00.400
singing,

00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:02.400
and traditional dancing.

00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:03.400
The Siva,

00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:04.400
and Fatalpati,

00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:06.400
or slap dance.

00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:09.400
The Salihapaga congregation

00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:12.400
is on the island of Uppolo.

00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:14.400
Its territory includes beaches,

00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:16.400
and the Tohswa Ocean Trench,

00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:20.400
a volcanic swimming hole popular with tourists.

00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:22.400
The 21 publishers,

00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:24.400
of the Salihapaga congregation,

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:28.400
send their warm love and greetings.

00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:31.400
From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:34.400
this is J.W. Broadcasting.
