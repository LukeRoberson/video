00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:10.419
The evening before he died, Jesus Christ asked his father in prayer to watch over his disciples.

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:18.039
His request is recorded at John 17, 15 through 17. Read it with me.

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:19.940
Jesus said,

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:28.440
I do not request that you take them out of the world, but that you watch over them because of the wicked one.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:35.320
They are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:46.700
Jesus' confidence in Jehovah and in the power of the truth can be seen clearly in what he asks of his father in verse 17.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:55.000
Sanctify them by means of the truth. Your word is truth.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:09.799
When we accept the truth and make a personal dedication to God, in a general sense, we are sanctified or set apart from the world because we no longer fit into its mold.

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:15.099
People view us differently because our values have changed.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:28.200
We live by the standards of Bible truth, and doing so honors Jehovah God, gives our life meaning, and brings us great happiness.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:38.599
With those thoughts in mind, how should we feel about the sayings of God and the Bible truths that we have learned?

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.500
We feel the way the Psalmist did.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.000
At Psalm 119, 140, he said to Jehovah God,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.299
your saying is thoroughly refined, which means that it's clean and pure, and then he said,

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.500
and your servant loves it.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.400
Isn't that how we feel about the truth? We love it.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.800
It would be wonderful if everyone would respond to the truth of God's Word and love it.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.000
However, the sad fact is that the majority of the world rejects it.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.900
There are many people who do not believe that truth is attainable.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.900
Some ancient philosophers made the teaching of doubts virtually their life's work.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:39.099
Human philosophy is built on pride of intellect and a warped pleasure of endless speculation

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:44.900
that leaves Jehovah God the Creator completely out of the picture.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:56.000
By removing God, philosophers wander in a maze of ideas and theories that fascinate the mind and inflate the ego,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.500
but never arrive at the truth.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:09.300
If truth were not attainable, why would Jesus Christ say as recorded at John 831 and 32?

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:17.599
If you remain in my Word, you are really my disciples, and you will know the truth,

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.500
and the truth will set you free.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.400
Are we not experiencing the freedom that Jesus spoke of?

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:35.199
And why would the Apostle Paul write at 1 Timothy 2.4 that God's will is that all sorts of people should be saved

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:39.699
and come to an accurate knowledge of truth?

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:47.300
Why does the word truth occur over a hundred times in the Christian Greek scriptures?

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.900
Jesus not only pointed out that the truth is attainable,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.199
but he showed that finding it is required if our worship is to be approved by God.

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:04.599
When a Samaritan woman wondered what the true form of worship was,

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.400
the worship practiced by the Jews in Jerusalem,

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.599
or that practiced by the Samaritans among garrism,

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:17.399
Jesus did not answer by saying that truth is unattainable,

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:19.899
and you don't need to worry about it,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.399
or you can believe whatever you want to believe.

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:28.600
No, Jesus did not view the truth as relative,

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.600
that whatever you want to believe is the truth.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:39.000
That is nonsense and has nothing to do with the realities of life.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.699
At John 423 and 24,

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.600
Jesus made a specific reference to truth,

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.199
God's spirit, and pure worship.

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:54.800
At John 423 and 24, he said,

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.300
true worshipers will worship the Father with spirit and truth,

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:06.100
for indeed the Father is looking for ones like these to worship Him.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:14.500
God is a spirit, and those worshiping Him must worship with spirit and truth.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.399
Jesus was talking about being guided in our worship by God's Holy Spirit,

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:24.399
and that we do not need the use of temples, images,

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:28.399
or other physical objects in true worship.

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:36.100
And the truth that Jesus referred to is an accurate knowledge of Bible truths.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:42.199
True faith is much more than just belief in God that He exists.

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:46.000
It also means an acceptance of God's Word,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.800
obtaining an intellectual understanding of that Word,

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:55.100
and then manifesting a heartfelt reliance upon it.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.199
As genuine Christians,

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:01.699
we view the Bible as the inspired Word of God,

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:06.899
beneficial for teaching and disciplining mankind.

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:12.000
Psalm 119, 160 says of Jehovah God,

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:17.600
the very essence of your Word is truth.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.600
When Jesus Christ stood before Pontius Pilate

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.199
and told him that He had come to earth to speak the truth,

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:27.800
Pilate responded with the words,

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.000
what is truth?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.100
Likely, Pilate was cynical.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.399
His words reveal a skeptical view of truth.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:42.300
But the truth that Jesus had in mind was about God's kingdom

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.600
and Jesus' role as its king.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:52.199
That was the very theme, the core of Jesus' teaching while He was on earth.

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:55.899
That's why when Pilate asked Jesus if He was a king,

00:06:55.899 --> 00:06:57.800
Jesus replied,

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.800
you yourself say it.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.000
In other words,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.300
yes, I am.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:08.399
But He added that His kingdom was no part of this world.

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:13.399
The truth is that His kingdom will sanctify Jehovah's name,

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:15.600
vindicate His sovereignty,

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:21.899
and restore faithful mankind to happy eternal life.

00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:27.399
Genuine Christians embrace this truth.

00:07:27.399 --> 00:07:31.399
Since Jesus' role in the fulfillment of all of God's promises

00:07:31.399 --> 00:07:36.300
is so pivotal and since all of God's prophecies become amen

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.699
or true because of Him,

00:07:38.699 --> 00:07:43.600
Jesus could well say as recorded at John 146,

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:49.000
I am the way and the truth and the life.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.399
And as 2 Corinthians 120 declares,

00:07:52.399 --> 00:07:55.899
for no matter how many the promises of God are,

00:07:55.899 --> 00:07:59.899
they have become yes by means of Him.

00:07:59.899 --> 00:08:05.600
Therefore also through Him is the amen said to God.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:12.399
Jesus used the word amen to affirm the truthfulness of what was said.

00:08:12.399 --> 00:08:16.100
But He did so in a unique way.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:22.399
We usually say amen after a prayer is said to show our agreement with it.

00:08:22.399 --> 00:08:27.899
However, rather than use it to reply to a prayer or a statement,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.600
He used amen to introduce pronouncements of truth.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:38.200
At times He repeated the word saying amen, amen,

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:42.000
and then made His statement which would be like saying,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.700
most truly I say to you.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.899
Yes, by using this expression,

00:08:48.899 --> 00:08:54.700
He assured His listeners that His words were the absolute truth.

00:08:54.799 --> 00:08:57.600
Jesus could speak with such certainty

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:04.799
because He was the one authorized to make all of God's promises come true.

00:09:04.799 --> 00:09:11.500
To us, the exhilarating good news of God's kingdom under the rulership of Jesus Christ

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:16.100
is more far more than mere information.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:19.299
That truth moves us to action.

00:09:19.299 --> 00:09:24.600
It compels us to live by it and share it with others.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.700
To the first century Christian congregation,

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:31.500
the way of life they adopted as followers of Christ

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:38.500
was sometimes known simply as the truth or the way of the truth.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:43.500
Read with me 3 John, verse 4, where it says,

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.500
no greater joy do I have than this,

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:53.799
that I should hear that my children go on walking in the truth.

00:09:53.899 --> 00:09:56.899
Isn't that how parents feel about their children

00:09:56.899 --> 00:09:59.700
who are serving Jehovah faithfully?

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.700
Absolutely.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:06.700
However, not all young ones raised in a believing household

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:09.200
have stuck with the truth.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:13.899
The same is true about many with whom we've studied the Bible.

00:10:13.899 --> 00:10:16.799
Is there a situation hopeless?

00:10:16.799 --> 00:10:19.000
No, not at all.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.399
There's still time for them to act and show Jehovah

00:10:23.399 --> 00:10:28.500
that they love Him and that they love the truth.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:32.399
The end of this system is fast approaching.

00:10:32.399 --> 00:10:38.200
It is going to happen and soon we encourage such ones

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:42.799
to give serious thought to their relationship with Jehovah God

00:10:42.799 --> 00:10:46.000
because He genuinely loves them

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
and wants them to have life.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
We pray that such ones take whatever steps are necessary

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.200
to return to Jehovah before it's too late.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:02.500
It's a scriptural fact that people need to love the truth

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.100
in order to be saved.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.799
This is the point that the Apostle Paul makes

00:11:07.799 --> 00:11:12.500
at 2 Thessalonians 210, where it reads in part

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:18.299
that people will perish because they did not accept the love

00:11:18.299 --> 00:11:23.200
of the truth in order that they might be saved.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:27.299
Our prayer is that honest-hearted people everywhere

00:11:27.299 --> 00:11:31.899
will respond to Jehovah's invitation to draw close to Him

00:11:31.899 --> 00:11:34.899
and love the truth.

00:11:34.899 --> 00:11:38.500
This world is heading for an abrupt end

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:41.200
at the Battle of Armageddon.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:46.299
To survive that battle, we must have knowledge of Jehovah God

00:11:46.299 --> 00:11:51.399
and live in harmony with His Word, which includes the teachings

00:11:51.399 --> 00:11:54.100
of Jesus Christ.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.100
Earthwide, we are proclaiming the good news

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:01.299
that God's kingdom has been established in the heavens.

00:12:01.299 --> 00:12:06.700
That proclamation is the foretold witness to all the nations

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:11.500
that soon the accomplished end of this world system will come.

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:14.899
No, no, not the end of our planet,

00:12:14.899 --> 00:12:20.000
because another basic truth is that the earth remains forever

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.899
as stated at Ecclesiastes 1-4.

00:12:23.899 --> 00:12:31.799
These are absolute truths that we preach, and we love them.

00:12:31.799 --> 00:12:38.700
Knowing the truth sets us free from lies, delusions, and superstitions.

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:44.399
And when we live by it, the truth strengthens us to endure hardships.

00:12:44.399 --> 00:12:48.600
God's truth is so reliable and well-founded,

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:56.200
and it so inspires us with hope that it enables us to stand up under any test.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:00.500
We see our brothers in lands where they are mistreated and persecuted,

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:06.500
doing just that, and they do it with joy.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:10.799
To dismiss truth as relative or non-existent

00:13:10.799 --> 00:13:17.799
is to miss out on the most thrilling and fulfilling quest that life offers.

00:13:17.799 --> 00:13:21.799
To find the truth is to find hope.

00:13:21.799 --> 00:13:26.600
To know and love it is to know and love the creator of the universe

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.399
and His only begotten Son.

00:13:29.399 --> 00:13:37.500
To live by it is to live with purpose and peace of mind now and forever.
