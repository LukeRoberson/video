00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:09.259
Whether you're in school or not, you're probably under a lot of pressure.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.039
Not just from all the studying and those piles of homework.

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:16.920
But pressure from other kids.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.600
Pressure to have sex.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.120
Or cheat. Or maybe it's to smoke. Or take drugs.

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:27.440
Of course, you know what they want you to do is bad.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.760
But at times you may feel like you're missing out if you don't join them.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.759
You're not alone.

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:38.759
Since the world began, young people have been dealing with peer pressure.

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:40.759
But it doesn't mean you have to give in.

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:42.759
The Bible has some good advice.

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:46.759
Exodus 23-2 tells us not to just follow after the crowd.

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:51.759
In other words, don't do something just because everyone else is doing it.

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:54.759
Instead, be your own person.

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:59.460
How do you get the strength to stand up to peer pressure?

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.460
Here are four steps that can help.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.459
First, keep on the lookout for moral dangers.

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:11.459
And identify any situations where you might be pressured to do something wrong.

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:13.459
If you see trouble coming your way,

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:17.459
don't walk right into it, find another route, and avoid the problem.

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:21.180
The second step.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.590
Stop and take the time to think.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.590
Think about the consequences before you give in to peer pressure.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:36.560
In Proverbs 14-15, the Bible says,

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.560
smart people watch their step.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.560
So don't just jump in and do what others say.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:53.310
It may be hard to do if you're trying to fit in.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.310
But that's the time to use your imagination.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.310
How will I feel later if I give in?

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.200
What might be the outcome?

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.200
How might my actions affect others that care about me the most?

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.020
Step 3. You need to plan ahead.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.020
Proverbs 24-5 says that a person who has knowledge increases his power.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.020
If you know exactly why you're saying no to something,

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:30.569
why something is bad, it can give you the strength to say no.

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.569
Now the fourth step.

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.569
Take action.

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.569
No, you don't have to give your peers a lecture.

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.569
Just say no, clearly and confidently.

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.569
You may be surprised at their reaction.

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.569
Each time you take a stand for what you know is right,

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.569
you get stronger and stronger.

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.569
And that makes it easier to resist the pressure the next time.

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.569
You don't need to be rude,

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.569
but you could give a reason why you wouldn't want to join in.

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.569
And if they do keep pressuring you, just remember this.

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.569
Giving in to peer pressure is kind of like being turned into a puppet

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:10.569
with your peers pulling the strings.

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:16.030
You can't hide from peer pressure,

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.030
but you can stand up to it.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.919
Remember to keep on the lookout.

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:24.919
Think about the consequences.

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:27.919
Plan ahead and take action.

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:33.460
Facing up to peer pressure can be scary at times.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.460
But when you do, you show the decisions you make really are your own.
