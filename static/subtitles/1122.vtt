00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.129
I tried to look for work, but I was unsuccessful.

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:09.130
It was a struggle even to get water.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:14.130
And a specialist gave us diagnosis of a very aggressive brain tumor.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:21.129
My negative disposition made me a very impatient, sarcastic and demanding person.

00:00:21.129 --> 00:00:26.129
The fact that I was not appointed as an elder made me feel disappointed.

00:00:26.129 --> 00:00:31.129
Jehovah who act in the near future, fulfilling all his promises.

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:34.130
And so I'm happy to enjoy.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.130
And when everything around you is chaotic,

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:43.130
the one thing you have is your relationship with Jehovah.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.130
Re-gaining joy isn't work in progress.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.130
I've always admired the beauty and power of the sea.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.130
It reminds me that the one who created the sea,

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.130
it's not hard for him to care for.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.130
Just one small human like me.
