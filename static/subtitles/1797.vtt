00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:07.280
Would you like to see how some of your brothers and sisters are displaying that kind of endurance?

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:15.560
We'd like to introduce you to brother Vasili Kalin who was baptized for more than 50 years and

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.719
Serves together with his wife Maria at the Russia branch

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.920
Has their load been easy to carry?

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:31.339
This is their story

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:40.020
I was born in Ukraine to a family of Jehovah's Witnesses. When I was five, our whole family was exiled to Siberia

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:47.259
Traveling in the same train was a little girl who 17 years later would become my wife. That was Maria

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:49.659
We were married in

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:56.689
1968

00:00:56.689 --> 00:01:01.049
Under the Soviet Union there was a ban on importing our publications

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:05.329
The congregations needed more literature, and we wanted to help the brothers

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:10.329
So Maria and I decided that we would start printing the publications ourselves

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:21.170
I knew it would be risky because we had two young children our son was done only five years old and our daughter was less than a year old

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.409
We risked losing our freedom and even our children

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:34.250
But we trusted in Jehovah to support us and we didn't think too hard about what could happen if we have done that

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.409
We would just have given up

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:45.769
My biggest problem was that I had no experience with photo development whatsoever

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:50.730
So what did I do? I bought a reference book and some equipment

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:57.689
The circuit of this year gave me the microfilm that was used for duplicating the literature

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.129
Then one evening we tried printing the literature for the first time

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:04.730
Of course, it was a complete mess

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:11.409
But in a little while we were able to start producing publications that were of good quality and readable

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.689
Our work was highly confidential and we had to keep it a secret even from our family

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:21.689
who were all witnesses

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:26.009
Our work was done at night we closed our curtains and turn off the lights

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:29.409
We had a red lamp that gave us light while we were working

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:35.009
When the literature was ready, we would deliver it in the morning to all the congregations

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:44.050
It was also difficult and dangerous because if they caught us with literature, there was no doubt we would be sent to prison

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:51.490
We needed to travel dozens of kilometers. I am very grateful to Maria that she often helped me

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.810
A brother would drive up in his car and I would pass on the literature to him

00:02:56.169 --> 00:03:00.210
One time the brother was late in Siberia it gets very cold

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.610
And I remember that it was snowing so heavily that I turned into a snow woman you could say

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.210
I couldn't go into a store to her mom because the brother could come any minute and we would miss each other

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.530
So I had to wait

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.930
Well, of course, then Maria when I would come back from work and Maria wasn't home

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.930
I would get very worried

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:24.210
Anything could have happened. Maybe she had been arrested

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.650
Sometimes our children knew that mama was a way delivering literature and they also got worried

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.849
Unfortunately, everything I have gone through has taught me never to rely on myself

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.770
But instead to completely trust in Jehovah

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:48.090
We got a lot of joy out of the years we spent producing literature

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.969
We knew that our brothers and sisters were being fed spiritually

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:59.770
We are grateful to Jehovah that for 17 years we were able to print the publications

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.500
1991 was a landmark year for Jehovah's Witnesses in the Soviet Union

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.500
We received official recognition what a victory that was

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:18.620
Unfortunately the situation with Jehovah's Witnesses today reminds me of the time we lived through

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.899
I see that Satan's methods have not changed

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.019
But it is really encouraging to remember that Jehovah also has not changed

00:04:27.019 --> 00:04:32.139
He defended and protected his people in the past and he will do the same today
