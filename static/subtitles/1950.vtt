00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:08.699
Some accuse the Bible of being a collection of myths and legends written by

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:15.939
well-intentioned humans. By contrast, the Bible says that it is the word of God

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:25.379
who cannot lie. If the Bible was authored by God, it should be like no other book

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:32.859
ever written. For example, when it mentions scientific matters, what it says

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:39.299
should be in harmony with proved science. When it foretells the future, those

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:45.420
prophecies should come through 100% of the time. And if the Bible contains God's

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.500
message to mankind, it should be available no matter where a person lives and

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:57.619
no matter what is done to stop its distribution. Is the Bible full of myths or is

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:02.380
it accurate? Consider just some of the evidence indicating that the Bible is

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:08.659
truly an extraordinary and trustworthy book. During the time when the Bible was

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:16.340
written, many people had mistaken ideas about the shape of the earth. A theory

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.900
written after the Bible was completed was that the universe emerged from a

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:28.379
cosmic egg and that the earth is supported by various creatures. In contrast

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:35.819
about the year 1473 BCE, Moses wrote that the earth is suspended upon nothing and

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:41.900
around the year 732 BCE, the prophet Isaiah wrote that the earth is a circle or

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:48.780
sphere. These Bible writers contradicted ideas that were popular at the time.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.459
It was some 200 years after Isaiah's day that the Greek philosopher Pythagoras

00:01:54.459 --> 00:02:00.379
may have proposed that the earth is a sphere. And more than 3,000 years passed

00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:05.180
from Moses' writing until scientists such as Isaac Newton realized that the

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:16.539
earth seemed to hang upon nothing. No human can foretell the future in exact

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:23.860
detail. Yet about the year 732 BCE, the prophet Isaiah foretold that a man named

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.219
Cyrus would conquer the mighty city of Babylon, that he would dry up a river, that

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:36.099
he would enter the city through open gates. History confirms that every

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.979
detail of this prophecy was fulfilled. Concerning the same city, the prophet

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:47.219
Jeremiah foretold, that Babylon would become piles of stones and never again be

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:52.259
inhabited. Despite its strategic location, Babylon eventually became a pile of

00:02:52.259 --> 00:03:00.490
stones and remains that way. Throughout history, powerful men have tried to stop

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:08.490
the distribution or translation of the Bible. They burned at the stake those who

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:14.610
translated it into common languages and persecuted those who read it. The Bible

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.129
has weathered the most sustained attack of any book in history. Yet it has

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:23.930
become the most widely translated and published book of all time. Billions of

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:30.729
copies have been produced in some 2,700 languages. The Bible is scientifically

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:38.409
accurate, contains reliable prophecy, and is available to all mankind. You have

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:44.289
good reason to believe that it is inspired by Jehovah, the God who cannot lie.

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:51.849
Still, you may ask, is the Bible still relevant today? Why are there so many

00:03:51.849 --> 00:04:01.460
different versions of the Bible? What are the keys to understanding the Bible? To
