WEBVTT

00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:04.679
You have completed your Gilead schooling.

00:00:04.679 --> 00:00:08.679
You've done well, and we warmly commend you.

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:11.679
You've reached the finish line for this school.

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:14.679
When the program concludes, you will be a graduate.

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:19.679
You've run this course, so to speak, with that goal in mind haven't you.

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:22.679
Yet, through it all, you also kept in mind that for you,

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:28.679
this experience is a part of a bigger race, the race for life.

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:33.679
Like determined runners, loyal servants of God keep moving forward

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:36.679
after each goal in their service to Him.

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:40.679
Such goals are like stages in a race.

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:46.679
Some of our goals and our pace may vary from person to person based on circumstances.

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:52.679
For you, Gilead School is a goal or stage that you have now completed,

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:55.679
but keep running.

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:59.679
See, we run until we reach what our faith shows us,

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:07.680
the prize waiting beyond the ultimate finish line ever lasting life in the service of Jehovah.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.680
The promise is founding God's Word, move us to keep reaching out for that prize.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.680
Consider the Apostle Paul who was reaching out for the heavenly hope.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.680
At 2 Timothy 4, 7, and 8, he indicated that he had reached the finish line,

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.680
his prize was in sight, and it was reserved for him.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.680
He said, I have fought the fine fight.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.680
I have run the race to the finish.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.680
I have observed the faith.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.680
From this time on, there is reserve for me the crown of righteousness.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.680
With strong faith, Paul could see beyond the finish line,

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.680
and he yearned for the reward that he would receive.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.680
And then there is Jesus example.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.680
Just before breathing his last, he cried out, it has been accomplished.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:07.680
Throughout his earthly ministry, that goal to accomplish Jehovah's will for him never left his sight.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.680
No matter how painful his life course proved to be,

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.680
Jesus kept his integrity and finished that course like the true Son of God that he is.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.680
In all of this, Jesus saw more than just the finish line.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.680
He saw the endless joy that was waiting for him.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:36.680
So powerful is Jesus example that Hebrews 12 verse 2 urges us to keep it centered in our sight.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.680
We invite you to follow along there with Hebrews 12 and verse 2.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:49.680
It says, as we look intently, at the chief agent and perfector of our faith, Jesus,

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.680
for the joy that was set before him, he endured a torture state, despising shame,

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.680
and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.680
Who were we urged to look at intently?

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.680
The perfector of our faith, Jesus.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.680
And what did Jesus look at? What did he see?

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.680
He saw the joy that his faith placed directly in front of him.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.680
Jesus focused on the joy that would result from his life course of perfect integrity,

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:29.680
from providing the ransom for us and from being back alongside his heavenly Father.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.680
Jesus never took his eyes off the prize waiting beyond the finish line and neither should we.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.680
Let's look at some important lessons that will help all of us to complete the race for life.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.680
We will consider two main points.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.680
First, how should you run each stage of the race?

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:56.680
And second, qualities that will help you to run like a true Christian and win.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.680
Now for the first point, how should you run each stage of the race?

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.680
The race for life is a race of endurance.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.680
And as mentioned, it includes stages or success of goals.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:15.680
We strive for each goal at our individual best pace and with a clear focus on the ultimate goal or prize.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.680
First Timothy 619 calls that prize the real life.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:27.680
That is everlasting life in perfection, either in heaven or on earth.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.680
As mentioned, your Gilead training is now a completed stage of the race for you.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:41.680
With humility, apply all that you have learned and remain focused on the endless joy ahead of you.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.680
When hardships and difficulties come and they will keep moving forward.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:56.680
If you are knocked down by anything, get back up and run with determination with everything that you've got.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:04.680
Be like the marathon runner from the country of Tanzania who ran in the 1968 Olympics held in Mexico City.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.680
At one point during that race, he was bumped by other runners.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.680
And he fell to the ground so hard that he gashed his knee and dislocated it.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.680
He also smashed his shoulder against the pavement.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.680
Yet after receiving some medical attention, he refused to stop running.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:30.680
He continued in the race. His pace was slower, but he moved forward toward his goal.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.680
He was no longer running for a mere material prize.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:41.680
He was running to complete the race with his honor intact and that of the land he represented. He finished the race.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:49.680
In the race for life, you may experience times when you feel as if someone or something is trying to knock you down.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.680
What will you do? Learn from what happened to the Galatians.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:01.680
When some in the first century allowed the speech and actions of others to knock them out of the race,

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:08.680
notice what Paul said to them at Galatians 5 and verses 7 and 8.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:15.680
Imagine that he has an incredulous tone as he speaks to him and states in verse 7.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.680
You were running well. Who hindered you from continuing to obey the truth?

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.680
This sort of persuasion does not come from the one calling you.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.680
What was the problem?

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.680
Some in Galatia had allowed themselves to be persuaded by false teachings,

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:40.680
and they were no longer obeying the truth. They gave into pressure.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:47.680
Also, in verse 13, Paul refers to the danger of fleshly desires.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.680
Whatever happened to them, those Christian runners were hindered, as he said,

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:59.680
because they took their eyes off of the prize. All of us must keep that lesson in front of us.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:06.680
If we do, we will never be hindered or thrown off course in our pursuit of the real life.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.680
We will be rock solid in our focus.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.680
When others see that you are looking straight ahead toward the prize,

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.680
they are helped to look in the same direction.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:23.680
Continue to be a real stabilizing influence in the branches where you will serve.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.680
So for our first point, how should you run each stage of the race,

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:35.680
run at your very best pace, and with a clear focus on your ultimate goal, the real life?

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:45.680
Now for our second main point, qualities that will help you to run like a true Christian and win.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:50.680
We run as true Christians when we follow the example of Christ.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.680
Jesus' example of doing all things for Jehovah's glory,

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:59.680
despite the suffering that He endured, is one that we must follow.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:04.680
First, Peter 2.21 reminds us that Christ suffered for you,

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:09.680
leaving a model for you to follow His steps closely.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.680
Let's consider two qualities that Jesus had in abundance,

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:19.680
and that we must imitate closely, faith and courage.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:24.680
For each quality, we will look at why we need it to win.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.680
So we begin with faith.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.680
Now, you do not need to be told what faith is.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:34.679
You have it, and you've learned much about examples of faith in your studies.

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:37.679
We need faith because faith helps us to endure,

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:43.679
and faith helps us to remember that our trials in life are temporary.

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:45.679
We look ahead with confidence.

00:08:45.679 --> 00:08:51.679
We see beyond the troubles of today, and we trust Jehovah every step of the way.

00:08:52.679 --> 00:08:56.679
You needed to have faith after you arrived for this school,

00:08:56.679 --> 00:09:01.679
and then had to wait patiently for some months for your classes to begin, true?

00:09:01.679 --> 00:09:05.679
You know it out wondered, when will the classes start?

00:09:05.679 --> 00:09:08.679
How will they be carried out in a pandemic?

00:09:08.679 --> 00:09:12.679
You waited, and in due time, your faith was rewarded.

00:09:12.679 --> 00:09:15.679
Jehovah saw to it that things worked out, didn't he?

00:09:15.679 --> 00:09:18.679
Your instructors and so many others working with Him

00:09:18.679 --> 00:09:21.679
ensured that the school moved forward safely,

00:09:21.679 --> 00:09:26.679
and that you received the full benefit from the classes.

00:09:26.679 --> 00:09:31.679
That experience highlights the kind of faith that all of us will need in the days ahead

00:09:31.679 --> 00:09:34.679
whenever new challenges arise.

00:09:34.679 --> 00:09:40.679
You could say that 2020 vision will be necessary for each of us to keep running successfully,

00:09:40.679 --> 00:09:43.679
and I don't mean the year 2020.

00:09:44.679 --> 00:09:48.679
True Christians look far ahead with clear spiritual vision.

00:09:48.679 --> 00:09:54.679
That's the point, and remain focused on the prize beyond the finish line.

00:09:54.679 --> 00:09:57.679
Those without faith cannot see it.

00:09:57.679 --> 00:10:03.679
They cannot focus on things unseen, but those with faith can see it.

00:10:03.679 --> 00:10:09.679
That is why they, why you, remained focused on Jehovah's promises.

00:10:09.679 --> 00:10:12.679
The scriptures are just to keep looking ahead.

00:10:12.679 --> 00:10:20.679
An example of this is found at 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and verses 17 and 18.

00:10:20.679 --> 00:10:23.679
2 Corinthians 4, 17 and 18.

00:10:23.679 --> 00:10:29.679
Now when writing these inspired words, Paul was encouraging the brothers not to allow problems,

00:10:29.679 --> 00:10:37.679
difficulties and persecutions, to cloud or block their view of the glorious reward that was set before them.

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:42.679
Please look at what is said starting in verse 17.

00:10:42.679 --> 00:10:46.679
For though the tribulation is momentary in light,

00:10:46.679 --> 00:10:53.679
it works out for us a glory that is of more and more surpassing greatness and is everlasting.

00:10:53.679 --> 00:10:59.679
While we keep our eyes not on the things seen, but on the things unseen.

00:10:59.679 --> 00:11:06.679
For the things seen are temporary, but the things unseen are ever lasting.

00:11:07.679 --> 00:11:17.679
Again, these inspired words should move us to look beyond the trials we face and to remain focused on what is ahead of us.

00:11:17.679 --> 00:11:28.679
Paul was speaking to those with the heavenly hope, but the encouragement and meaning behind these words applies to all who are running for the real life.

00:11:28.679 --> 00:11:33.679
That is for the things ever lasting as it says here.

00:11:34.679 --> 00:11:39.679
When we are determined and focused, we are helped to press on each day.

00:11:39.679 --> 00:11:47.679
Proverbs 4, 25 tells us to look straight ahead, fix your eyes or your gaze straight ahead of you.

00:11:47.679 --> 00:11:51.679
To keep doing that, we need faith.

00:11:51.679 --> 00:11:57.679
We need good spiritual eyesight to see what is otherwise unseen as Paul said.

00:11:57.679 --> 00:12:05.679
Keep in mind that the objective of your Gilead training is to strengthen and stabilize the field and branch organization.

00:12:05.679 --> 00:12:11.679
Whether a brother or sister, your example of faith, goes a long way in doing that.

00:12:11.679 --> 00:12:16.679
Others will imitate the faith and example of a determined runner.

00:12:16.679 --> 00:12:24.679
When you are settled in your assignments, keep your eyes of faith set on doing God's will.

00:12:24.679 --> 00:12:30.679
Danger can come when you start to feel that you've achieved most or even all of your goals.

00:12:30.679 --> 00:12:32.679
What could be the result?

00:12:32.679 --> 00:12:41.679
When we lose sight of the race and of its prize, our interests will focus on other things, perhaps material things.

00:12:41.679 --> 00:12:43.679
Don't let this happen to you.

00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:48.679
Never allow distractions to pull you off of the Christian course.

00:12:48.679 --> 00:12:54.679
And avoid ever becoming self-satisfied because of privileges that you may come to enjoy.

00:12:54.679 --> 00:12:59.679
Focus on the real life and remain humble.

00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:02.679
Appreciate your privileges in Jehovah's service.

00:13:02.679 --> 00:13:06.679
But remain focused on what you desire most.

00:13:06.679 --> 00:13:10.679
Pleasing Jehovah and doing his will forever.

00:13:10.679 --> 00:13:17.679
As we read earlier in Hebrews 12, when Jesus suffered unjustly to the point of death,

00:13:17.679 --> 00:13:21.679
he endured for the joy that was set before him.

00:13:21.679 --> 00:13:24.679
He always looked at what was ahead of him.

00:13:24.679 --> 00:13:30.679
The reward that he longed for was clear to him. It was that real to him.

00:13:30.679 --> 00:13:35.679
We must always remember Jesus' example as we keep looking ahead.

00:13:35.679 --> 00:13:43.679
Maintain your strong faith by reading God's word every day and applying its counsel in everything that you do.

00:13:43.679 --> 00:13:49.679
We endure in the race with courage when our faith is strong.

00:13:49.679 --> 00:13:53.679
And that is the second quality we will now look at courage.

00:13:53.679 --> 00:13:56.679
Why we need courage to win?

00:13:56.679 --> 00:14:00.679
True Christians have courage that stems from their faith.

00:14:00.679 --> 00:14:09.679
We live with hope, with expectation, and not just any expectation, but assured expectation as the Scriptures call it.

00:14:09.679 --> 00:14:13.679
When your rescued is assured, it gives you courage, doesn't it?

00:14:13.679 --> 00:14:21.679
Imagine how Jeremiah felt when Ebed Melek and 30 other men arrived to pull him up out of a deep sister.

00:14:21.679 --> 00:14:29.679
What could have seemed hopeless was now a moment filled with hope, and he continued on with courage.

00:14:29.679 --> 00:14:36.679
Courage moves us to look beyond any obstacles that may stand between us and the finish line.

00:14:36.679 --> 00:14:41.679
The fact is that nothing promised in God's word will fail to come true.

00:14:41.679 --> 00:14:49.679
So take courage. Keep in mind that your determination to do God's will means that for you, the prize will be waiting.

00:14:49.679 --> 00:14:52.679
Jehovah cannot lie.

00:14:52.679 --> 00:14:58.679
Therefore, as you go to your assignments, remain calm and assured of Jehovah's help.

00:14:58.679 --> 00:15:04.679
True, great changes have taken place in the world since you arrived for Gilead school.

00:15:04.679 --> 00:15:11.679
But though the world is changing around us, and certainly not for the better, remember Jehovah's promises.

00:15:11.679 --> 00:15:14.679
What we see happening is temporary.

00:15:14.679 --> 00:15:19.679
Pandemic, nothing new. Jesus foretold it, didn't he?

00:15:19.679 --> 00:15:24.679
Pastelence, as he called it, in one place after another.

00:15:24.679 --> 00:15:30.679
So we're not shaken by this. We have faith and courage, and we keep going, don't we?

00:15:31.679 --> 00:15:36.679
Think back to the Olympic marathon runner from Tanzania who we mentioned earlier.

00:15:36.679 --> 00:15:41.679
After being injured, he was bandaged and then continued to run.

00:15:41.679 --> 00:15:47.679
It took courage and determination to run and sometimes walk through the pain.

00:15:47.679 --> 00:15:53.679
When he eventually crossed the finish line, he was cheered by the small crowd remaining in the stadium.

00:15:53.679 --> 00:16:03.679
Now try to imagine, he was limping with his bandages blowing in the wind, but he moved forward toward his goal.

00:16:03.679 --> 00:16:10.679
For many, the race would have been long over, but that man was running for something more than a material prize.

00:16:10.679 --> 00:16:14.679
He saw something greater beyond that finish line.

00:16:14.679 --> 00:16:19.679
What was it? We find it in what he said afterward.

00:16:19.679 --> 00:16:23.679
When he was asked why he continued on in the race, he replied,

00:16:23.679 --> 00:16:28.679
My country did not send me 5,000 miles to start the race.

00:16:28.679 --> 00:16:33.679
They sent me 5,000 miles to finish the race.

00:16:33.679 --> 00:16:39.679
That sense of responsibility gave him the courage to go on despite the pain.

00:16:39.679 --> 00:16:44.679
He saw a greater purpose, and he returned home with honor.

00:16:44.679 --> 00:16:50.679
We too have a greater responsibility and a far more important race.

00:16:50.679 --> 00:16:54.679
We owe it to Jehovah to keep running the Christian course.

00:16:54.679 --> 00:17:00.679
He and his son gave everything you could say so that we can keep running.

00:17:00.679 --> 00:17:03.679
We also owe it to others.

00:17:03.679 --> 00:17:08.680
To set a good example for them that will motivate them never to give up.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:12.680
And we owe it to ourselves to use what we have been given,

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:17.680
so as to run in a way that we gain the real life.

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:24.680
We are certain that you have both the faith and the courage to run with the eyes of your heart,

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:29.680
looking intently at Jesus' example and at the prize.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.680
Soon review.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:36.680
What is the overall lesson for you, Gilea graduates, and really, for every Christian runner?

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:37.680
It is this.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:41.680
Run for the real life at your very best pace.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:43.680
Jehovah will help you.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:47.680
Run with a clear focus on your ultimate goal.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:52.680
And run the course with faith and with courage.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.680
When will the finish line be reached?

00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:01.680
For those who will live forever on earth, the Revelation climax book states this in chapter 11.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:06.680
Quote, by exercising faith throughout Jesus' millennial reign

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.680
and during the decisive test that follows,

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:14.680
these will be rewarded with life everlasting in paradise on earth.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:21.680
Their names will then remain indelibly written in the book of life end of quote.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:25.680
For true servants of God, that decisive test will be nothing to fear.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.680
They will never drop out of the race.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:32.680
For them, that test will be just another day on the calendar, so to speak.

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:37.680
They will keep going with their eyes fixed on what is ahead for them.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:45.680
Faith, courage, and all other God-like qualities will carry loyal ones into the real life.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:49.680
Use your Gilea training to run the race well.

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.680
Strengthen others to do the same.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:57.680
See the prize ahead of you and follow Jesus steps closely.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:04.680
Run the race through the approaching great tribulation and then keep running like a true Christian.
