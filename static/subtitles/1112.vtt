00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.280
Give me a truth.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.680
I'm sorry, what?

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.040
Your science says learn Bible truth.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.439
So I assume you're here to share said truth, so share one.

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.959
My name's Nita, what's yours?

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:56.040
Jade.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.239
Like the stone?

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:03.209
No, like I'm jaded.

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:06.329
Are you going to share something or what?

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.169
Um, yeah.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:11.409
Did you know the Bible says you can live forever?

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:12.409
Heaven.

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:14.409
That's what you're sharing.

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:16.409
That's not exactly new, is it?

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:20.490
No, I mean, did you know the Bible says you can live forever on earth?

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.129
But why would I want that?

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:23.849
This place is a mess.

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.650
But it won't be in the future.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.050
Revelation 21 verse 4 promises.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.849
And tea will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more.

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.930
Neither will morning nor outcry nor pain be anymore.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.889
The former things have passed away.

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:50.659
Since there's no death or pain in heaven, where would this promise to play?

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:53.840
The earth.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.919
I didn't know the Bible said that.

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:00.710
Wicked.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:01.710
I mean, that's cool.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.710
Oh, okay.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.710
Would you like to learn how to be part of that future?

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:07.710
Uh, yeah.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.710
Um, thanks.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.310
Um, I'm not really the churchy type, and I'm late, so.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:42.289
See you later.

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:43.689
So tell me.

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:45.689
Hi, again.

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:48.689
You're really quite stealthy.

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:50.689
Brilliant, right?

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.689
Perfect when I'm late for class.

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:54.689
Which is always.

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:55.689
Right.

00:03:55.689 --> 00:04:01.689
So, last week, you spoke about promises.

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:05.689
And I'm not about church, but I am about promises.

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:06.689
So?

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:07.689
Okay.

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:12.889
Well, if these are gods' promises, wouldn't it make sense to go to his word to find out

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:13.889
how to enjoy them?

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:14.889
Seems right.

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:15.889
Okay.

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:17.889
This is John 173.

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:26.019
Would you like to read it?

00:04:26.019 --> 00:04:27.019
Out loud.

00:04:27.019 --> 00:04:28.019
Really?

00:04:28.019 --> 00:04:30.019
Then you know what it says.

00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:33.019
I do, but it's nice to hear it again.

00:04:33.019 --> 00:04:38.610
This means everlasting life.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.610
They're coming to know you.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.610
The only true God.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.610
And the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.610
So, based on this, what means everlasting life?

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.079
Getting to know God.

00:04:55.079 --> 00:04:57.079
But how can you get to know something?

00:04:57.079 --> 00:05:00.550
You're not even sure it exists.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.550
Would you like to explore that answer next time you come by?

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.550
Who said anything about next time?

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:07.550
Oh.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:08.550
I'm just one of you up.

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:32.600
See you later.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:38.269
Let's do this.

00:05:38.269 --> 00:05:40.269
Bit of a neat freak.

00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:41.269
You don't say.

00:05:41.269 --> 00:05:45.269
So, last time we discussed how God created us to live forever.

00:05:45.269 --> 00:05:48.269
Which raises the question, why do we die?

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:49.269
Totally.

00:05:49.269 --> 00:05:51.269
Totally what?

00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:53.269
No, like I mean, I totally agree.

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:55.269
That's what we talked about.

00:05:55.269 --> 00:05:57.269
Right.

00:05:57.269 --> 00:06:00.269
Let's open to Romans 5, verse 12.

00:06:00.269 --> 00:06:01.269
Wait.

00:06:01.269 --> 00:06:04.269
Why don't I read it out loud so we can both enjoy it?

00:06:04.269 --> 00:06:12.750
That is why, just as through one man,

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.750
sin entered into the world, and death through sin.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:22.750
And so death spread to all men because they had all sinned.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:23.750
Okay, hold it.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.750
Is Adam the one man?

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.750
Exactly.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.750
This doesn't make sense.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.750
You said Adam was perfect and wouldn't die.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:33.750
That's right.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.750
But then he sins and loses that.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:39.750
So what's that got to do with me?

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.750
I die because he's stupid.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:47.990
Well, maybe not how I would have put it.

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.990
Maybe we can think of it this way.

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:54.990
When parents with a severe genetic defect have children,

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:55.990
what happens?

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.990
Usually the kids inherit it.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:59.990
Precisely.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.990
When Adam sinned, that sin became like a genetic defect

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.990
that caused sickness, aging, and death.

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.990
And since we're all his children.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:13.910
Oh.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.910
Brilliant.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:17.910
I get it.

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:20.910
Why don't we watch a little video that helps put it all together?

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:55.139
Need to your phone list.

00:07:55.139 --> 00:08:02.189
It's Jade again.

00:08:02.189 --> 00:08:05.189
We've only studied once this month.

00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:07.189
She's so unscheduled.

00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:09.189
I thought you said she was doing well.

00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:11.189
She was.

00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:14.189
Now it's just, see you later.

00:08:14.189 --> 00:08:17.540
How was your last study?

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:22.170
That's a very interesting question, but

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:25.170
it's not really what we're talking about in this paragraph, is it?

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:29.170
So, let's just read the scripture, shall we?

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:41.340
In my defense, I was annoyed.

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:44.340
She never even attempts to explain why she can't solve.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:46.340
I understand.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.340
Really, I do.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:52.340
But if she's still open to studying,

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:56.340
you can't let these little things drain your enthusiasm.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.340
I know.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:00.340
I just...

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.340
I wish she was more structured.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.340
It's like she doesn't take anything seriously.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.340
No study's perfect.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.340
She's making some effort.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:11.340
Focus on that.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:28.460
If anyone's infusing us in miscontagious, it's yours.

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.460
I haven't mentioned it already.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.460
I really love our chats.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:35.460
And I appreciate all your questions.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:36.460
Thanks.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.460
I know sometimes they're crazy.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:41.460
No, you're a deep thinker.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:42.460
It's good.

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.460
For both of us.

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:50.720
Okay, um...

00:09:50.720 --> 00:10:18.669
Yeah, we're cool.

00:10:18.669 --> 00:10:19.669
My treat.

00:10:19.669 --> 00:10:20.669
Oh, brilliant.

00:10:20.669 --> 00:10:21.669
Thanks.

00:10:21.669 --> 00:10:23.669
I didn't have any breakfast.

00:10:23.669 --> 00:10:25.669
So...

00:10:25.669 --> 00:10:27.669
We left off at paragraph 10.

00:10:27.669 --> 00:10:29.669
Listen...

00:10:29.669 --> 00:10:31.669
I don't have it in me today.

00:10:31.669 --> 00:10:36.549
I got like two hours sleep.

00:10:36.549 --> 00:10:37.549
You are right.

00:10:37.549 --> 00:10:40.549
Just super stressed.

00:10:40.549 --> 00:10:43.549
I can't focus.

00:10:43.549 --> 00:10:44.549
I'm really sorry.

00:10:44.549 --> 00:10:48.019
My boyfriend,

00:10:48.019 --> 00:10:49.019
school,

00:10:49.019 --> 00:10:51.019
work,

00:10:51.019 --> 00:10:53.019
everything else.

00:10:53.019 --> 00:10:55.019
I just don't even have time to breathe.

00:10:55.019 --> 00:10:58.019
When my schedule gets a bit crazy,

00:10:58.019 --> 00:11:01.019
I focus on organizing what I can.

00:11:01.019 --> 00:11:04.850
How about that?

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:07.850
I give everything a proper place.

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:09.850
Yeah, I'm not really the organization type.

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:11.850
But I can help.

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:14.850
I mean,

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:15.850
if you want.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:17.850
I guess a little help couldn't hurt.

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:19.850
So,

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:22.850
how to organize this your place right now?

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:26.669
Okay.

00:11:26.669 --> 00:11:34.919
Well, where should we start?

00:11:34.919 --> 00:11:35.919
You're the neat freak.

00:11:35.919 --> 00:11:37.919
You tell me.

00:11:37.919 --> 00:11:38.919
Let's try and find the bed.

00:11:38.919 --> 00:11:40.919
We'll work from there.

00:11:40.919 --> 00:11:59.700
Then can you more about what we talked about on Monday?

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.700
I did.

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.700
But,

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.700
why would you have a make a rule like that?

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.700
No sex unless you're married.

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.700
It's totally okay.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:12.700
It might seem odd,

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:16.700
but what quality do you most appreciate about Jehovah?

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:18.700
Who's love?

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.700
Me too.

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.700
So, if he truly loves us,

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:26.700
look at what he tells us at Isaiah 48 verse 17.

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:34.730
I, Jehovah, am your God.

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:37.730
Your God, Jade.

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:41.730
The one teaching you to benefit yourself.

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:49.980
The one guiding you in the way you should walk.

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:52.980
I don't get it. It just doesn't make sense.

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.980
Question.

00:12:54.980 --> 00:13:00.799
Does a little child always understand why mum and dad

00:13:00.799 --> 00:13:02.799
warns them not to do certain things?

00:13:02.799 --> 00:13:06.080
Probably not.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:09.080
So, why all the rules and warnings?

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.080
Well, they love them, don't they?

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:22.220
And so, if Jehovah loves you,

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:25.220
it often takes time to appreciate why

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:27.220
Jehovah asked certain things of us.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:31.590
But if we really love him,

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:35.590
we'll have faith that what he asks

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:40.789
is for the best.

00:13:40.789 --> 00:13:44.460
The real question is,

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:48.570
do you trust him?

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:53.929
I won't do.

00:13:53.929 --> 00:13:55.929
I really do.
