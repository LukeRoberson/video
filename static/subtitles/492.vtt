WEBVTT

00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:05.160
And the Watchtower under consideration today was entitled,

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.960
Your Deliverance is Getting Near.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.480
And that's the theme from which our date text

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.880
and comments were taken.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.239
And I'm sure you, like me, rejoice in the hope.

00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:20.399
You rejoice to think about the blessings

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:23.600
that will come right after the Great Tribulation

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.519
and Armageddon.

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:27.640
How encouraging to know that the world,

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.160
which, to many, seems out of control,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.759
is soon nearing its end.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.079
The grand finale is close.

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:37.840
How close?

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.759
Well, we all recall the stirring, concluding talk

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:43.159
at this year's regional convention.

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:46.759
It summed it up in one word, imminent.

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:49.320
The day and the hour for the judgment

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.679
against this system of things has been

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:54.520
on Jehovah's calendar for years.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.240
It's established.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.880
And as Habakkuk's prophecy indicates,

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.799
there is a rushing toward that day.

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:05.079
It will not be late.

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:07.840
Well, how does our date text today from Revelation chapter 6

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.799
and verse 15 help us to understand details

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:15.040
about that fast approaching Great Tribulation?

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.840
And then how can that advanced knowledge help us

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.400
to be prepared for what is coming?

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.200
Well, I invite you to open up your Bible with me

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.239
to read the context found in Revelation chapter 6.

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:31.560
We want to read verses 15 to 17 together.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.680
And keep in mind, as has been commented on,

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.120
that what we're going to read now in Scripture takes place

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.879
right after the Great Tribulation begins

00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:48.000
and right after false religion has been destroyed.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.879
The question is, how will the majority of mankind respond

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:55.239
to what's coming next and why?

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:58.480
Let's read it together, Revelation 6, 15 to 17.

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.560
Then the kings of the earth, the high officials,

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.280
the military commanders, the rich, the strong,

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.560
every slave and every free person,

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.800
hid in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.879
And they keep saying to the mountains and to the rocks,

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:19.560
fall over us and hide us from the face

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.120
of the one seated on the throne

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.360
and from the wrath of the Lamb

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.599
because the great day of their wrath has come

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:31.229
and who is able to stand.

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:35.750
Did you notice where the majority will turn for refuge?

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.030
It's amazing to think that even after the world empire

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.389
of false religion has been completely destroyed,

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:46.789
the majority of people will continue to trust

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:49.270
in human organizations.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.789
At that late hour, after the Great Tribulation

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:54.469
has started and before Armageddon has begun,

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:57.189
the Bible does not indicate that there is going to be

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:01.949
any mass conversion of people running to Jehovah's Mountain.

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:06.789
At that moment, political and commercial institutions

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:09.870
that will still be standing for a time

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.509
will appear to the majority to be rock solid

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:19.050
like mountains and caves.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.169
Verse 15 outlines the all-inclusive list

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:26.250
of those who will continue to be completely deceived

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.370
by Satan the devil.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.849
Think of it, all of them, including former adherence

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.289
of false religion or the non-religious

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:40.729
will go right back to their comfort zone

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:42.889
looking for protection and salvation

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.770
from human organizations.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.889
Will their comfort zone be a safe zone?

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:52.770
No. Notice how the Revelation climax

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.169
book described this passage of scripture.

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:58.330
I quote, neither caves in the literal mountains

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.689
nor symbolic mountain-like political

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:04.569
and commercial organizations will provide financial security

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:06.569
or any other kind of help.

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.009
Nothing will shelter them from Jehovah's wrath.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:16.209
Indeed, exciting and sobering times are rushing toward us.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.329
Well, how does this advanced information,

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.209
this inspired message from God

00:04:23.209 --> 00:04:25.970
help us prepare for that coming day?

00:04:27.089 --> 00:04:30.009
The Watchtower under consideration encouraged us

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:32.769
to think about what lies ahead

00:04:32.769 --> 00:04:37.290
and described this time period as a time of judgment and testing.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.129
Of course, when I thought about that future time of testing,

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:45.329
I thought to myself, today is a time of test, isn't it?

00:04:45.329 --> 00:04:48.410
Our brothers and sisters, unlike at any other time

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.250
in history, are facing failing economies,

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.610
natural disasters, health problems, untimely death,

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.129
war, persecution, all of our brothers and sisters

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:04.569
are facing a time of test right now.

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:08.610
Even armed raids at Bethel and at Kingdom Halls

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.810
are not uncommon today,

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.810
yet we have not yet entered the Great Tribulation.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.449
It's very likely that life will get even more difficult

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:21.569
in the near future.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.689
So it's good for us to think now,

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:27.490
what do I view as my comfort zone?

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:32.769
Is my trust and confidence even in little ways

00:05:32.769 --> 00:05:37.129
in material things or in the assets I have

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:38.930
in this system of things?

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:44.009
Do my response to difficulties and challenges today,

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.290
even before the Great Tribulation breaks out,

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.970
reveal that Jehovah is my rock and not in a human institution?

00:05:52.209 --> 00:05:54.769
Sadly, some of our brothers and sisters

00:05:54.769 --> 00:05:57.730
have been affected by the deception

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.089
that there is such a thing as material security.

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:07.050
In 2013, an elder, his experience was published in the magazine.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.850
He said this, I thought we could relate those of us

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:13.610
who were in full-time service.

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.610
He said, I'm normally very thrifty.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.569
If I pour out a little too much shampoo,

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:21.449
I put some back in the bottle.

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:23.610
Nevertheless, this elder, Alex,

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.250
got caught up in trading in the stock market,

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.449
thinking he could soon quit his job

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:31.089
and enter the pioneer service.

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:33.250
Well, he was well-motivated.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.529
But Alex became ever more engrossed in studying offerings,

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:41.209
the market reports, using his savings and money

00:06:41.209 --> 00:06:42.529
that he borrowed from brokers.

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:45.050
He bought stocks that the analysts,

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.810
the experts predicted would rise in value suddenly.

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.129
Instead, they dropped in value.

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:54.730
How did Alex respond?

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:57.250
He said, I was determined to get my money back.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.250
I felt that if I just held on, the stocks would come back up.

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:06.810
Can you imagine how Alex was feeling emotionally

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:10.610
for months waiting for the stocks to go up in value?

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:14.529
Alex found it difficult to focus on spiritual matters.

00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:16.009
He lost sleep.

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:20.050
The stocks, as you can imagine, never rebounded.

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.449
As a result, Alex lost his savings

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:24.970
and he had to sell his house.

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:28.490
He admits, I caused great pain to my family.

00:07:29.329 --> 00:07:31.250
But notice the powerful conclusion

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.490
through a tough experience that he related.

00:07:35.329 --> 00:07:38.610
He says, I now know that anyone who puts his trust

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:42.370
in Satan's system will be profoundly disappointed.

00:07:43.649 --> 00:07:45.970
It's a good reminder for all of us, isn't it?

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:49.889
Things in this system of things, human organizations,

00:07:49.889 --> 00:07:54.810
whatever source, political, commercial,

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:59.769
institutions of higher education cannot provide salvation

00:07:59.769 --> 00:08:02.689
now, nor in the future.

00:08:02.689 --> 00:08:04.449
Notice how Proverbs chapter 11,

00:08:04.449 --> 00:08:07.930
verse 28 harmonizes with the point that Alex made.

00:08:09.449 --> 00:08:13.430
Proverbs chapter 11, and verse 28,

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:17.629
the one trusting in his riches will fall.

00:08:17.629 --> 00:08:21.189
But the righteous will flourish like the foliage.

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:23.149
What's the point?

00:08:24.149 --> 00:08:28.629
Resting even a little bit of confidence or hope

00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:33.629
in our savings, perhaps our investments,

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:38.110
our ability to earn money in this system of things

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:43.110
amounts to resting our confidence in Satan the devil.

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:46.990
It's a comfort zone that is not safe.

00:08:48.269 --> 00:08:51.429
No wonder then the faithful slave has urged us all of us,

00:08:51.429 --> 00:08:53.629
including those of us in full time service

00:08:53.629 --> 00:08:57.470
who perhaps have made a life of sacrifice

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.230
to put Kingdom interest first,

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:01.149
to think seriously about the question,

00:09:01.149 --> 00:09:03.750
am I ready to give up material things?

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:09.549
Knowing where we run for comfort today,

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:12.269
even when there's little difficulties in our life,

00:09:12.269 --> 00:09:15.149
challenging circumstances, gives us a good indication

00:09:15.149 --> 00:09:17.389
of where we're going to run in the future

00:09:17.389 --> 00:09:19.429
when things get more difficult.

00:09:20.629 --> 00:09:22.990
Of course, Jehovah does not want us to face the future

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:27.990
with fear, he wants us to face the future with confidence.

00:09:28.269 --> 00:09:29.669
And we can.

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:32.309
Our knowledge of what the near future holds,

00:09:32.309 --> 00:09:36.230
the details of how the great tribulation will unfold,

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:39.230
the instability of this dying system of things

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:44.230
convinces us that there is no comfort zone

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:47.070
in this system of things.

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:49.830
There's no safer comfort zone than entrusting

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:52.470
in Jehovah day after day.

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:56.350
So may this reminder serve to encourage us

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:57.950
to continue to work diligently

00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:59.870
to store up treasures in heaven,

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:01.590
treasures that will never fail,

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:04.990
treasures that will continue through the great tribulation

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:09.990
after Armageddon and safely lead us into the real life.

00:10:12.149 --> 00:10:14.070
It's even as the Apostle Paul was inspired

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.029
to write to Timothy,

00:10:16.029 --> 00:10:19.470
may we continue to put our hope not on uncertain riches,

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:24.470
but on God who richly provides for us all today

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:29.149
and forever, even during the great tribulation.

00:10:29.149 --> 00:10:31.350
Yes, doing so will convince us

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:34.149
that our deliverance is getting near

00:10:34.149 --> 00:10:36.309
and we have nothing to fear.
