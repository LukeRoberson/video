00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:29.659
How did I give her the wrong idea?

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.260
How did I let my guard down?

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.260
If I see her again, I'll make sure she gets the right message.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.859
In the past, I would have witnessed immediately in a situation like that.

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:44.219
What changed?

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:51.019
I've always been busy, but maybe I've let my busy life start to crowd out the important things.

00:01:51.019 --> 00:01:56.859
Like my Bible reading.

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:02.859
That night I did some research, and I found Ephesians chapter 5, verse 25.

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:09.360
Husbands, continue loving your wives, just as the Christ also loved the congregation.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.159
I needed more, though.

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:13.159
Verse 26 stood out to me.

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:16.360
There it says what Jesus does for the congregation.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.759
Cleansing it with a bath of water by means of the Word.

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:24.659
If I'm going to stay morally and spiritually clean,

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.460
I need to read God's Word every day.
