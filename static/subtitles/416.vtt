00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:12.359
James 3, 5 and 6 tells us in part the tongue is a small part of the body and yet see how

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:21.960
small a fire it takes to set a great forest ablaze. The tongue is also a fire. Well just how

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:30.239
small is the tongue. An average adult's tongue weighs only about two and a half ounces. That's

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:36.759
a small part of the body weight of a 200 pound man. But that little two ounce tongue has great

00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:42.719
power. If you think about it, they can actually lift thousands of pounds of weight. For example,

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:52.969
when a chairman of the convention says, please stand. Of course that power can be used for good

00:00:52.969 --> 00:01:00.530
or for bad. And the warning in today's scripture text, if we're not careful, it can cause great

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:09.090
damage. Just like a tiny, lighted match flipped carelessly aside, can burn thousands of acres of

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:16.129
beautiful trees to the ground. Well, what are types of speech that can be like a destructive fire?

00:01:16.129 --> 00:01:24.689
Lying, slander, backbiting, harmful gossip and false teaching a few examples. But during our

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:32.530
discussion, let's talk about a type of speech that may be more subtle, more insidious, but nevertheless

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:42.609
is very harmful. What is it murmuring? Let's discuss avoid murmuring. Now what is murmuring?

00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:50.049
According to the dictionary to murmur, means to make low, continuous, indistinct sound or

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:57.489
succession of sounds. Of course, in nature, there are many very pleasant murmuring sounds. For

00:01:57.489 --> 00:02:06.769
example, it's pleasant to listen to gentle breezes murmur through the leaves of trees. It's soothing

00:02:06.769 --> 00:02:13.330
to listen to a small stream of murmuring its way through a forest or down a mountain slope.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:20.530
But the same cannot be said about murmuring by the human tongue. It is far from pleasant.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:31.330
One dictionary said that murmuring by humans means complaining in low mumbling tones, grumbling.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.689
The watchtower said that the Hebrew term meaning to murmur can also mean to growl.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.090
We're out in service, and if a dog growls at us, it's not a pleasant sound that draws us.

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:52.050
We want to distance ourselves. Of course, murmuring permeates Satan's world.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:03:00.689
Children murmur against their parents. Wives murmur against their husbands. Employees murmur

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:08.370
against their employers. Multitudes murmur against God, blaming him for bad things that happen.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.490
But here's an important question. How does Jehovah view murmuring? We'll open up to numbers,

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:21.330
chapter 12, please. And here's an interesting account. It gives us some insight into Jehovah's

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:30.689
viewpoint. Numbers 12 verse 1. Now, Miriam and Aaron began to speak against Moses because of the

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:38.530
Cushite wife he had married. Verse 2. They were saying, and apparently on an ongoing basis,

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:47.569
is it only by Moses that Jehovah has spoken? Has he not also spoken through us?

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:55.250
Now notice the next thought. And Jehovah was listening. And Jehovah didn't like what he heard.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:03.889
If you look at verse 9, his anger burned, and he struck Miriam with leprosy. Now think about this.

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:10.129
Of all the diseases, Jehovah could have struck Miriam with. Why did he choose leprosy?

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.810
Well, Jehovah doesn't tell us. But think about this. A person struck with leprosy, especially

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.730
in Bible times, was made physically repulsive. You could say physically ugly.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.730
Well, by talking the way she was talking already, she was spiritually repulsive in Jehovah's

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:34.689
eyes. So by striking her with leprosy, Jehovah allowed everyone to see what Jehovah already saw

00:04:35.329 --> 00:04:42.930
in Miriam. There's another account to chapters later. It talks about how the Israelites began to

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:50.850
murmur after hearing the negative report from the 10 spies. How did Jehovah react?

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:58.290
He decreed that all the murmurs 20 years of age and over would never make it to the Promised Land.

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:05.730
They would die in the wilderness. So obviously, Jehovah hates murmuring. You could say he abominates it.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:14.290
But now the question is, why? Well, let's briefly discuss three reasons. One, it breeds discontent,

00:05:15.329 --> 00:05:24.769
both in ourselves and in others. Jude 16 speaks of murmurs complaining about their lot in life.

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:33.730
And it's true. The more a person complains about his lot in life, then the deeper the discontent

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:39.089
becomes in his own heart. And since murmurs never keep their complaints to themselves,

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:47.490
it shows discontent in others. See, and if you think about this, who was the original promoter of

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:55.009
discontent with one's lot in life, Satan the devil? He succeeded in sewing discontent in Eve's heart.

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:03.329
So a murmur is actually imitating the methods of the devil. And apparently a murmur reminds

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:08.850
Jehovah of his arch enemy Satan. And that's certainly something no wise person wants to do. Remind

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:19.009
Jehovah of Satan. Well, what is the antidote? Cultivating contentment. First Timothy 6, 6, there is

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:26.850
great gain and godly devotion along with contentment. And several scriptures talk about contentment.

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:33.009
And when we count our blessings, we have from Jehovah. See, we can be content, can't we? No

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:41.649
matter what our circumstances now. A second reason Jehovah hates it. It incites hatred. Again,

00:06:41.649 --> 00:06:48.769
both in our own heart and in others. Open up to Proverbs 17, please. And here's an interesting

00:06:48.769 --> 00:06:58.290
scripture on this. Proverbs 17 verse 9, whoever forgives the transgression seeks love.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:08.610
But the one who keeps harping on a matter separates close friends. So notice, love should move us

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:14.529
to cover over forgive the transgressions of others. But if we don't do that, we keep harping about

00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:21.009
their transgressions, murmuring about them. See, then hatred for that one grows in our own heart.

00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:27.569
And how does it affect others? Well, again, it soes hatred in their heart. The watchtower some

00:07:27.569 --> 00:07:34.449
years ago had a little article, why keep free from murmuring? And it gave an example. It says,

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:39.889
suppose a Christian starts to complain to you about a certain appointed elder about how he

00:07:39.889 --> 00:07:47.009
performs his duties, how he handles his parts on the platform. And it says, if you listen to the

00:07:47.009 --> 00:07:53.329
complainer, you can begin to think as he does. Then as you observe the elder, you could be saying to

00:07:53.410 --> 00:08:01.970
yourself, now that I think about it, what my friend says about this elder is true. I never thought of

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:06.769
it that way before. See, before it didn't bother you now, it bothers you. Eventually everything

00:08:06.769 --> 00:08:16.290
the elder does can be improper in your eyes. But now what is the antidote? Well, like it said in

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:26.529
Proverbs, whoever forgives the transgression seeks love. So cultivating love, making allowances for

00:08:26.529 --> 00:08:33.649
others, forgiving them, not harping about their transgressions, but forgiving as we pray and hope

00:08:33.649 --> 00:08:38.610
Jehovah will do for us. But now the third reason Jehovah hates it, it manifests pride.

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:46.370
Korah, Daithan, Abiram, remember they murmured against Moses? We've had enough of you.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:53.090
The whole assembly is holy, all of them. And Jehovah is in their midst. Why then should you

00:08:53.090 --> 00:09:00.850
exalt yourself above the congregation of Jehovah? See, their murmuring was an outward expression of

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:08.289
an inward condition pride. And we know how Jehovah reacted in that case. But now what's the antidote?

00:09:08.289 --> 00:09:16.529
Humility. See, lowliness of mine. Not trying to tear others down with our talking to elevate

00:09:16.529 --> 00:09:25.009
ourselves, but lowliness of mine will protect us. So we've discussed that murmuring breeds discontent

00:09:25.009 --> 00:09:34.529
insights, hatred, manifest pride. No wonder Jehovah hates it. But as we said, if we cultivate contentment,

00:09:34.529 --> 00:09:44.769
love, and we cultivate humility, these will serve as antidotes to our ever-becoming murmurs. And

00:09:44.769 --> 00:09:53.169
we'll be successful in applying Philippians 2.14, which says, keep doing all things free from

00:09:53.169 --> 00:10:00.289
murmurings. And it didn't say most things. Keep doing all things free from murmurings. And we'll

00:10:00.289 --> 00:10:06.049
prove to Jehovah that we're assets in his organization. He'll want us in his organization now.

00:10:06.769 --> 00:10:16.210
He'll want us in his new world in the future.
