00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:11.630
We always admired friends who had sacrificed a lot for Jehovah and moved to a

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.469
place where they need us greater and it's always been our dream to experience it

00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:23.829
ourselves. But at the same time we felt that we wouldn't be able to do something

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:28.149
like that. Even though we had the desire we felt that only superhumans can make

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:35.450
that kind of change in their lives. On the JW Broadcasting of August 2015 we saw

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.890
a very encouraging video about the Williams family and how they moved to

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.609
Ecuador. And we thought that in reality there wasn't anything standing in our

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:53.329
way so why couldn't we do the same? So we discussed it and decided on a date late

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:04.409
November 2017 and then we prayed to Jehovah. I read the 2016 year book and the

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.370
story about Indonesia really touched me. We saw that there is a great need in

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:20.159
many Asian countries and we thought maybe Thailand. We wanted to simplify our

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:27.430
lives even more so we moved to a smaller apartment. At the special convention in

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.870
Helsinki we met a couple who lives in Thailand and they gave us a lot of

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:40.469
advice and encouragement. We wrote a letter where we told a bit about ourselves

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:44.670
and then gave it to the service committee in our congregation. They then sent

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:52.129
the letter to the branch in Thailand. We sold our car and we also had the

00:01:52.129 --> 00:02:24.740
opportunity to move in with Benjamin's parents. We received a tremendous help

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:32.099
from all in the congregation. For instance we needed to find a place to live, a car

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:38.819
and to know where to shop for food. And their love and encouragement has been

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:50.509
invaluable. We received a letter from the Thailand branch or response to the

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:55.349
letter we wrote earlier. They gave us information about the living expenses and

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:00.469
some pointers about the culture, the food and our spirituality in the new

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:07.870
environment. And we have felt more comfortable and motivated by knowing that we

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.110
have followed the directions from Jehovah. We have always felt encouraged by reading

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.030
experiences about brothers and sisters who have made sacrifices to Jehovah and

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:27.750
how they have been blessed but to experience it yourself is amazing. When a

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:34.990
problem or an obstacle arose, Jehovah was there and ready to help us and now

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.509
we're happy to enjoy the privilege of serving Jehovah here.
