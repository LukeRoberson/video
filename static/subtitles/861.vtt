00:00:04.209 --> 00:00:08.210
People have a need to worship something.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.210
A higher power.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.210
Themselves.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.500
Other people.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.500
Money.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.350
But how should we fill this need?

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.350
What did Jesus say?

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:33.350
True worshipers must worship with spirit and truth.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.350
The 2025 Convention of Jehovah's Witnesses continues the new video series.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.350
The good news according to Jesus.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.350
Jesus alone is qualified to teach us how to worship God.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.350
The benefits are personal, immediate, and everlasting.
