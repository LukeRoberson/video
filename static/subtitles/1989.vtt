00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:07.730
and introduction to the Book of Colossians.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:15.730
The Apostle Paul wrote this inspired letter in Rome around 60 or 61 CE.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:22.219
This was during his first imprisonment there while he was under house arrest.

00:00:22.219 --> 00:00:26.940
Paul's letter to the Colossians indicates that he had not visited Colossi.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.699
Evidently, the congregation there was the fruitage of the work of Epipharus.

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:39.140
Still, Paul knew several members of the congregation, including Apia, Archipus, and Philemon,

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.060
to whom he also wrote an inspired letter.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:48.500
Sometime after the congregation was founded, false teachers tried to mislead the Colossian

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.020
Christians with deceptive philosophies.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:01:01.100
Epipharus traveled many hundreds of miles from Colossi to Rome to give a report on the congregation to Paul.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.780
The letter to the Colossians has four chapters.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:13.420
In chapter 1, Paul expresses his desire that the Colossians continue to grow in accurate knowledge of God.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:20.620
Paul then describes God's son as the image of the invisible God, the first born of all creation,

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.859
and the one through whom all other things were created.

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:28.299
Christ is also the head of the congregation.

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:34.299
In chapter 2, the Apostle warns the Colossians about those who are promoting philosophies

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.819
and the observance of the Mosaic law.

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:43.019
Paul stresses that the Mosaic law has been erased and taken out of the way.

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:48.219
God had figuratively nailed it to Christ's torture stake.

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:49.819
Did you know?

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:55.659
At Colossians 410, Paul mentions Mark, the cousin of Barnabas.

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:04.140
For a short time, Mark, also called John, a company Paul and Barnabas on their first missionary tour.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:11.580
But Mark left them and may have returned home to Jerusalem, which disappointed Paul.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.620
About 12 years later, however, Mark was in Rome as Paul's co-worker.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:23.389
Clearly, any breach between the two had been healed.

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:29.310
In chapter 3, Paul encourages the congregation to go on seeking the things above,

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.629
where the Christ is seated at the right hand of God.

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:38.830
The Apostle also exhorts the Colossians to strip off the old personality,

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.030
to clothe themselves with the new personality,

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.509
and to continue forgiving one another freely.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.110
In chapter 4, Paul tells the Colossians to persevere in prayer, along with thanksgiving.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.310
He also writes,

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.789
Let your words always be gracious, seasoned with salt,

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:02.750
so that you will know how you should answer each person.

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.439
As you read the inspired letter to the Colossians,

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.840
note how we should continue to grow and accurate knowledge of God,

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.439
how we can cultivate a Christ-like personality,

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:21.039
and how our speech should always be gracious,

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:25.039
especially as we proclaim the good news of God's kingdom.
