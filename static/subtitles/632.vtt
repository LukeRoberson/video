00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:07.259
Now this morning, I'm going to focus on the first words of our text.

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:15.039
It says, the word of God is alive and exerts power.

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:18.539
The word of God is alive.

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:27.300
Now, there's no question that this text does apply to God's written word, the Bible.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:38.299
But Jehovah had a word, God's word existed, even before the art of writing was invented.

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:42.539
Now, how long before we don't know?

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:47.140
At least as long as Jesus has been alive.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.219
Before Jesus was alive, of course, Jehovah had no one to speak to, but now with the creation

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.500
of Jesus, he and his son could communicate.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.619
Now, what is God's word?

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:03.539
We've said that it's the expression of his purpose.

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.180
And that means that when Jehovah says he's going to do something, it's as good as done.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.459
And nothing and no one can stand in the way.

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:20.340
But sometimes, with the best of intentions, we could actually get in the way of a decision

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.379
or a project that Jehovah approves of.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.980
Now, we have an example of this in an event that happened in the lives of Esau and Jacob.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.780
Now, who was getting in the way in that story?

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.859
The faithful man, Isaac.

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:45.459
After 20 years of marriage, Isaac and Rebecca finally had two sons, Esau and Jacob.

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:48.299
But we know that Esau was the first born.

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.340
And as the watchtower pointed out this week, in patriarchal times at the death of the father,

00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:57.140
why the first born took the lead in the family.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.939
He was the one who conducted family worship, and he served as a sort of priest.

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.099
And that's why the Bible speaks of priests being present at Mount Sinai

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.860
before the Levitical priesthood was set up.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.460
But Jehovah had told Rebecca that Jacob was going to have the first born's position.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.900
We don't know if he told Isaac, but he did tell Rebecca

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:26.780
that Jacob was going to have the first born's position.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.060
So the word had gone out.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.740
The expression of God's purpose had gone out.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.020
Jacob would take precedence over Esau.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.620
Could anyone challenge that?

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.659
Now, what you consider what God's purpose was, Jacob was the right choice, wasn't it?

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:46.099
It wasn't it, because what was God's purpose?

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.900
It was to set up a nation of worshipers.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.300
Those who were going to worship Jehovah, now between Esau and Jacob,

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:59.180
who was most likely to conduct family worship with his children, his offspring,

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.780
certainly Jacob.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.900
Now, for the first 15 years of their lives, Esau and Jacob could probably have heard Abraham

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.460
talk about the promise that God had given him, that all of the families of the earth

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.060
were going to be blessed by means of his offspring.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.780
And no doubt Jacob realized what a beautiful privilege it would be to share in the fulfillment

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.379
of that purpose.

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:32.500
While Rebecca loved the one Jehovah loved most, Jacob, Isaac loved Esau.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.460
Even after Esau had married out of the truth twice.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:42.020
Well some in full-time service have a brother or sister who isn't doing very well in the

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.020
truth.

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:46.620
He or she is the favorite.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.699
Go figure.

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:55.659
Even parents in the truth don't always love the one Jehovah loves most.

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:59.979
Now one day, Isaac had a conversation with Esau, and it's interesting.

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:06.139
Look at Genesis chapter 27, we're going to read verses 1 to 4, and there are a couple

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:08.979
of lessons here that we're going to consider.

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:15.500
Genesis chapter 27, we're going to read verses 1 to 4.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:22.540
It says, Now when Isaac was old and his eyes were too weak to see, he called Esau, his

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:28.779
older son to him and said, My son, he replied, Here I am.

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:32.500
And he went on to say, I have now grown old.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.300
I do not know the day of my death.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.860
So at this time it take please your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.779
field and hunt some wild game for me.

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:48.620
Then make the kind of tasty dish that I'm fond of, and bring it to me.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:56.220
Then I will eat it so that I may bless you before I die.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.100
Before I die.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.540
So Isaac was on his deathbed, right?

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.180
Wrong.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:12.100
If you do the math, you see that Isaac lived for 43 years after he had that last meal.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:17.740
But we can understand why he felt that he was on his last legs because he was blind.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.220
He couldn't do what he used to do.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.740
And so he probably thought that his life was over, and that could happen to any one of

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.740
us.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:30.579
You know if we're in constant pain or we're crippled, well we might think we're finished.

00:05:30.579 --> 00:05:35.139
So here's the lesson, No matter what your limitations are, don't give

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:36.860
up on life.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.060
Find out what you can do, and then do what you can.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.699
The dead can't praise Jehovah, but you can as long as you're alive.

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:49.259
And even if you get to the point where all you can do is keep your integrity and praise

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:51.899
Jehovah, do that.

00:05:51.899 --> 00:05:53.379
Don't give up.

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:59.180
But now let's get back to the point we started with, and that is with the best of intentions

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.300
we could get in the way of Jehovah's purpose.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:08.819
Now Isaac was determined to bless Esau and make Jacob his servant.

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:11.220
Isaac was getting in the way.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.459
He was getting in the way of Jehovah's purpose.

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:22.019
It seems that later Isaac realized his mistake because when Jacob was leaving to find a wife,

00:06:22.019 --> 00:06:29.060
Jacob was told, God Almighty will give you the blessing of Abraham.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.660
Isn't that beautiful?

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.459
And Almighty will give you the blessing of Abraham.

00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:39.060
Tells you what kind of a man Isaac was.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.939
He was a spiritual man.

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:47.180
Yes, he loved Esau more than Jacob, and yes, he wanted Esau to have the blessing.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:55.579
But when Jehovah's will became clear, Isaac submitted the Apostle Paul wrote, by faith,

00:06:55.579 --> 00:07:00.100
Isaac blessed Esau and Jacob.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:05.459
And now the application, what would it be possible for us to get in the way when Jehovah

00:07:05.459 --> 00:07:12.379
decides to do something, or when he approves a project that maybe we don't agree with?

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:14.180
It could happen.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:18.019
The organization suggests a new way to carry out the preaching work.

00:07:18.019 --> 00:07:21.259
We tell our service group, that'll never work here.

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:25.259
Maybe it'll work somewhere else, but not here, or we're different.

00:07:25.259 --> 00:07:27.379
What about our building projects?

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.259
Why do we need Ramapul?

00:07:30.259 --> 00:07:33.339
Armageddon's coming.

00:07:33.339 --> 00:07:38.579
In the late 40s, when the decision was made to expand world headquarters at 124 Columbia

00:07:38.579 --> 00:07:42.139
Heights, a few of the brothers took a dim view.

00:07:42.139 --> 00:07:46.579
Why spend the time and the money so close to the end?

00:07:46.579 --> 00:07:53.180
Then in 1953, at the world, at the business meeting of the Watchtower Society, brother

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.339
nor read a letter from a sister.

00:07:55.339 --> 00:07:58.540
Now, just for context, this is 1953.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:05.339
And in those days, as I will recall, some thought that Armageddon was going to come 40 years

00:08:05.339 --> 00:08:07.139
from 1914.

00:08:07.139 --> 00:08:09.339
We were doing a lot of counting back then.

00:08:09.339 --> 00:08:13.100
So this sister writes to brother Norrin and says, why are you spending all this money on

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:17.500
building projects when Armageddon could come in 1954?

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:23.620
Well, if we'd listened to her and others like her, where would we be today?

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:27.740
Still back at 124 Columbia Heights.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:32.779
Speaking about our building programs, brother Norr once made a very profound statement.

00:08:32.779 --> 00:08:34.700
It's simple, but it's profound.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.620
He said, we're going to keep building.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:41.700
Let Jehovah stop it if he doesn't agree with it.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:44.620
I think he could do that, couldn't he?

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:50.340
Now sometimes a body of elders has a lively discussion about some project or initiative.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.860
Maybe it's the need for a new kingdom hall.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.220
And we may have our concerns.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.299
We may have reservations.

00:08:56.299 --> 00:08:58.419
We express those.

00:08:58.419 --> 00:09:04.980
But if a number of spirit directed men are enthusiastically in favor of a project, it's

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:08.940
very possible that Jehovah agrees with it, too.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.379
So we wouldn't want to get in the way.

00:09:11.379 --> 00:09:14.259
And we wouldn't want to be a naysayer.

00:09:14.259 --> 00:09:19.700
Sometimes what happens when we're in a building project, we have a trouble with permitting.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.220
We can't get the permits we need right away.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:26.179
Or maybe a building inspector comes and he causes a lot of trouble.

00:09:26.179 --> 00:09:30.460
And we wouldn't want to be the type of person who says, well, this project mustn't have

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:36.139
Jehovah's blessing because if it had Jehovah's blessing, everything would go smoothly.

00:09:36.139 --> 00:09:39.179
Tell that to Nehemiah and the Jews in his day.

00:09:39.179 --> 00:09:41.139
They had no end of trouble.

00:09:41.139 --> 00:09:45.899
And yet what they were doing had Jehovah's approval.

00:09:45.899 --> 00:09:49.500
The Word of God is alive and exerts power.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:54.419
When Jehovah has a purpose, we see what we can do to advance that purpose.

00:09:54.419 --> 00:09:57.100
And if there's nothing we can do, we pray for it.

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.179
And then we get out of the way.
