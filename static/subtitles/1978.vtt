00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:05.259
and in production to first John.

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:13.210
First John is the longest of the Apostle John's three inspired letters.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:20.210
John was likely in or near Ephesus when he wrote his letters in about 98 CE.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.210
He also wrote his gospel account at about the same time.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:33.210
John did not address his first letter to any individual but wrote it as a general letter to all Christians.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:43.210
His purpose was to strengthen the faith of fellow Christians in the truths that God had revealed to the Christian congregation.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:51.780
The letter addresses three main themes, the Antichrist, sin and love.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.780
First John contains five chapters.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:03.780
In chapter 1 John tells us that God is light and that Christians must walk in the light.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:13.780
To walk in the light, we need to recognize that we are sinners and need forgiveness based on Christ's propitiatory sacrifice.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.780
Chapter 2 warns us about antichrists.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:26.780
Among other things, they claim that Jesus was not the Christ and that the Son of God had not come in the flesh.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.780
Did you know?

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:40.780
More than three decades earlier, it was foretold that false teachers would bring in destructive sects and try to draw away the disciples after themselves.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.780
John's writings show that this apostasy was well underway.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.780
In chapter 3 John contrasts the children of God with the children of the devil.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.780
The children of God love one another.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.780
The children of the devil like Cain hate their brother.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.780
The theme of love continues in chapter 4.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:13.780
Here John reminds us that we cannot rightly profess to love God if we do not love our fellow Christians.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:22.780
In the final chapter we read, this is what the love of God means that we observe His commandments.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:31.780
Also, John assures us that God hears all our prayerful requests when these harmonize with His will.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:40.780
As you read first John, note how we must reject apostates, how we can guard against the practice of sin,

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.780
and how we should cultivate love for our fellow subjects of God's kingdom.
