00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:06.190
and introduction to the Book of Joshua.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.189
The Book of Joshua is named after its writer, Joshua, the son of Nun,

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:16.190
who succeeded Moses as leader of Israel.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.190
The book likely covers a period of more than 20 years,

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:26.190
starting in 1473 BCE, and ending in about 1450 BCE

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.190
when the book was completed.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.189
The Book of Joshua can be divided into four sections,

00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:38.189
Israel's entry into Canaan, the conquest of the land,

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:41.189
the apportioning of it to the individual tribes,

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:45.189
and Joshua's final exhortations.

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:49.189
The Book provides valuable lessons on the need for courage,

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:55.189
faith, and obedience, especially when God's people face strong enemies.

00:00:55.189 --> 00:01:03.630
In chapters 1 and 2, Jehovah tells Joshua to be courageous and strong.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.629
The Israelites prepare to cross the Jordan River,

00:01:07.629 --> 00:01:12.629
and Joshua sends out two spies who go to Jericho.

00:01:12.629 --> 00:01:16.629
The spies go to the home of Rahab, a prostitute.

00:01:16.629 --> 00:01:20.629
Moved by faith in Jehovah, she hides the spies,

00:01:20.629 --> 00:01:24.629
thereby disobeying the order of the king.

00:01:24.629 --> 00:01:31.629
In chapters 3 to 6, Israel miraculously crosses the Jordan River on dry ground,

00:01:31.629 --> 00:01:35.629
even though the river is at flood stage.

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:41.629
The Israelites observe the Passover and begin to eat the produce of the land.

00:01:41.629 --> 00:01:45.629
Joshua then meets a man with a drawn sword.

00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:48.629
The man is the Prince of Jehovah's Army.

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:53.629
Through him, Jehovah tells Joshua how to conquer Jericho.

00:01:53.629 --> 00:01:59.629
Chapters 6 to 12 describe the conquest of the promised land.

00:01:59.629 --> 00:02:03.629
In chapter 6, Jericho falls.

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:07.629
Only Rahab and her father's household are spared.

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:14.629
In chapter 7, Aiken is exposed for disobediently taking spoil from Jericho.

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:17.629
He is put to death along with his family,

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:20.629
who no doubt helped to conceal his sin.

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.169
Did you know?

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:30.169
Rahab and Aiken provide contrasting lessons in faith and obedience.

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:35.169
Though a canonite, Rahab was saved because she obeyed the spies

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:39.169
and showed courageous faith in Jehovah.

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:43.169
Although Aiken was a member of God's dedicated nation

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:47.169
and witnessed Jehovah bringing down the walls of Jericho,

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:54.169
he was put to death because of his disobedience, lack of faith, and greed.

00:02:54.169 --> 00:03:01.699
In chapter 8, A.I. is conquered and reduced to a permanent mound of ruins.

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:05.699
Joshua then reads God's law to the people.

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:08.699
Half of the nation stands in front of Mount Gharism

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:12.699
and the other half in front of Mount Evil.

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:18.699
In chapter 9, the Gibbianites trick Joshua into making a covenant with them

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:21.699
and he spares their lives.

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:27.699
Chapters 10-12 contain a record of some of Israel's God-given victories.

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:31.699
God even hurls great hailstones at the Amorites

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:37.699
and makes the sun stand still so that Israel can take vengeance on its enemies.

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:45.699
In chapters 13-22, the Promised Land is apportioned among the tribes of Israel.

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:48.699
The tabernacle is set up at Shiloh.

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:54.699
And the Israelites select six cities of refuge for the unintentional manslayer.

00:03:54.699 --> 00:04:00.699
In chapter 22, the tribes of Rubin and Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:04.699
go to their inheritance east of the Jordan.

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:10.699
Chapters 23-24 contain Joshua's farewell speeches.

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:13.699
He tells the people to fear Jehovah

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:17.699
and serve him with integrity and faithfulness.

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:22.699
Joshua, as well as Aaron's son Eliasar, then die.

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:26.699
Also, the Israelites fulfill their sworn oath

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:33.300
to bury the bones of Jacob's son Joseph in the Promised Land.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:40.300
As you read the book of Joshua, note how Jehovah blesses faithful and obedient ones.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.300
See how he fights for his people

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.300
and observe how he fulfills all his promises,

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.300
thus strengthening our faith and our future inheritance under his glorious kingdom.
