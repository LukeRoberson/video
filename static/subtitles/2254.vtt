Hey, check this out.

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:08.880
Huh?

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.880
Gossip.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.880
It may seem like nothing more than harmless talk.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:14.880
Or is it?

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.879
If you've ever found out somebody was talking about you behind your back, then you know.

00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:24.129
Gossip can hurt.

00:00:24.129 --> 00:00:31.500
The Bible says at Proverbs 12-18, that words can staff like a sword.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:39.500
So how can you make sure that you aren't the one doing the staff?

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.820
Are you supposed to stop talking completely?

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.820
At Philippians 2-4, the Bible says we're supposed to be interested in the lives of others.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.820
So it's normal to talk about other people.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.820
But that talk can quickly turn ugly and damage a person's good reputation.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.829
So what can you do before this happens?

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:10.829
For example, when comments about others get sarcastic or negative,

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:14.829
that's a sign the conversation's going in the wrong direction.

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:16.829
Don't get dragged in.

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:18.829
Change the subject.

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:22.829
You have to take action and fast.

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:25.829
Take responsibility.

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:29.829
You see, even if you're not the source of a rumor,

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:34.829
repeating it can make you guilty of spreading falsehood.

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.829
Instead, save yourself a lot of pain by following the Bible's wise counsel

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:42.829
and first Thessalonians 4-11.

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.829
Mind your own business.

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.829
Before you start talking about others, ask yourself,

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.829
do I really know all the facts?

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.829
If what I say gets repeated is the other person's reputation going to be damaged?

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.829
And what about my own reputation?

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.829
Remember, whenever harmful gossip creeps into your conversation,

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:10.830
take action.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.830
The people around you will feel happy and so will you.
