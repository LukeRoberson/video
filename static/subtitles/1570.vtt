00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:10.740
I, Stephen, take you, Emily, to be my wedded wife.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:18.010
I, Emily, take you, Stephen, to be my wedded husband.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:29.699
I had no doubt our vows were forever, nothing could have prepared me for the heartbreak.

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:50.670
I never expected her to be unfaithful and unwilling to work things out.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.179
I felt humiliated.

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:58.859
How could she do such a thing?

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:10.819
I was embarrassed and I didn't want to talk to anyone.

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:15.060
I read somewhere that time would help me heal.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:28.950
And just to stay busy, it seemed to work, but I was constantly reminded of what I lost.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:43.739
Our spiritual goals, the hopes and dreams we had, all destroyed.

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:59.500
I didn't want to dwell on the hurt, but I just couldn't ignore it.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.299
Was I really coping?

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:10.030
Or was I leaving myself open to even more pain?

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:16.990
I was angry, but not just with Emily.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.590
I was angry with everything.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:34.930
Stephen, Stephen, hey, let me stop by tomorrow.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.409
What I had to say, I wouldn't have blamed time for judging me, but he didn't.

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:43.939
You're right.

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:45.979
I'm Stephen.

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:53.240
I can't understand how you feel, but you know who can.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.439
Do you remember Psalm 34?

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:02.659
I think verse 18 says it best.

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:06.539
Can you read it for us?

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:10.259
Jehovah is close to the broken hearted.

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:13.659
He saves those who are crushed in a spirit.

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:20.060
In that beautiful scripture, take advantage of Jehovah being that close to you

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.620
and include him in everything.

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:27.020
Jehovah is a loving shepherd.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.300
When we hurt, he cares.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:36.129
I knew this, but in a way, I'd forgotten.

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:42.090
I realized I hadn't included Jehovah in the ways I tried to cope.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.370
Staying busy was important, but I needed to draw closer to God.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.090
Not push away.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.979
And when I did, the real healing began.

00:03:55.979 --> 00:04:03.240
Even though the pain is still there, Jehovah sees the tears.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:09.430
Jehovah feels what I feel.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:24.370
It is getting better, slowly, because Jehovah is close to the broken hearted.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:41.339
Jehovah is close to the broken hearted.
