00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:10.230
When the preaching work was getting started in such countries as South Korea, Jehovah often used missionaries to help strengthen our brothers.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:23.050
In an archived interview, Brother Jong-il Park describes the effect this had on his sacred service and how it prepared him for the trials he would face.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:33.049
From 1939 on, our brothers didn't have any contact with Jehovah's organization and they thought that no organization exists.

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:45.049
And then in 1948, a brother read from a newspaper about the activity of Watchtower Society and it surprised the brothers.

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:57.049
So, brothers wrote the society and the society was so happy hearing from Korean brothers and they answered with many booklets in Korean.

00:00:57.049 --> 00:01:06.049
There were two different reactions. Some brothers was excited about preaching work yet another group.

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:20.049
The question is that true organization of Jehovah, first missionary group brother and sister still arrived in August 9th, 1949.

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:31.049
All the questions were answered by a brother still and then right away brothers were preaching in unity.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:44.390
I began pioneering in January 1950 and then March 1950, six more missionaries arrived from Gileo School.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:51.390
We had only one congregation in Seoul and the missionaries were busy for many Bible studies.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:02:01.390
So many interested persons coming to the meetings. The public talk was arranged in school auditorium, first time.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:19.860
And there were over 360 people attending whereas the public was about 60.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:31.860
The same day Korean War broke out and the missionaries had to leave in 27th of June to Japan.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:40.860
And then our brothers had to take refuge to a thousand parts of Korea.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:49.860
I was hiding in the country. Then a few days later the secret police from communist found us.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.860
We explained to him as a Christian, we cannot participate in the war.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.860
So we had to hide ourselves.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:13.210
And then he says, well, I do not know much about religion so I better take one of my friends who knows about religion.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:19.210
So I will come back tomorrow. Don't leave from here.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:25.210
So then we waited until next day and he came with another.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:34.210
So I started preaching from the Bible that why this war broke out and many problems in the war,

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:40.210
so on, because the fulfillment of Jesus' prophecy in March 24.

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:47.210
Then they said that, well, thank you very much for your preaching and then say goodbye.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:55.210
Then two days later the letter one came with another friend so that we could preach to them.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:01.210
During three months they were staying in Seoul and in fact they protected us.

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:17.110
I was picked by South Korean army and to serve the back support of the military in front line

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:25.110
to carry arms to the soldiers, which I could not accept.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:37.029
So I refused it and then I was beat.

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:42.029
And then one day this company has to move to other place.

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:53.029
I hide myself in the behind of ceiling and so that they don't notice when they leave the place.

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:59.029
And the next morning when I came down, there were nothing left.

00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:08.029
I walked on one street toward one direction and then I found a sign.

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:11.029
It says International Bible Students Association.

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:17.029
So I stayed with the brothers for six months.

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:25.029
The brothers still came back from Japan by himself so that they take care of the brothers.

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:37.029
In 1952, the brothers still recommended me to Gilles' school so that I was invited in 22nd class.

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:43.029
So I took the steps to get the passport.

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:48.029
And then the government found out that I didn't serve military.

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:54.029
They gave me the draft notice instead of passport.

00:05:54.029 --> 00:06:00.029
So I had to stand for the neutrality instead of going Gilles' school.

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:06.629
It made me to be confined in military prison for two years.

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:14.629
Then 1958, I was enrolled in Gilles' school in 32nd class.

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:20.629
I really appreciate that Gilles' school training.

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:26.629
Since my job in the branch, especially in translation work,

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:29.629
it involves a deep knowledge.

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:35.629
And the Gilles' training was certainly helped in translation work.

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:40.629
The real appreciation about the truth and the organization,

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:46.629
the brothers' qualities, the humbleness, and weakness.

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:55.629
Certainly, it helped me to follow the examples to apply in the full-time service.

00:06:55.629 --> 00:07:03.689
Did you know what Brother Parks said he appreciated most,

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:07.689
even after enduring persecution and prison for his faith?

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:10.689
It was the Christ-like qualities of his brothers,

00:07:10.689 --> 00:07:14.689
and the training he received from Jehovah's organization.

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:19.689
Another example of the benefits that result from our meeting together.

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:23.689
If you'd like to find more ways to imitate Brother Parks' faith,

00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:29.689
you can read his life story beginning on page 12 of the December 2008 issue of await.
