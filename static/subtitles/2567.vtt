00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:11.539
The France Branch Committee is delighted to present to you the construction and renovation project for the Bethel situated in Luvier.

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:17.539
Due to the acceleration of the Kingdom work, this project had the branches become necessary.

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:31.539
The France Branch supervises the territories of France, Saint-Pierre et Miquelon, Saint-Martin, Saint-Bathelomy, Guadeloupe, Martinique, French-Guyanna, Maillot and Reunion.

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:37.539
A total of 13 countries and territories with a population of 150 million.

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:52.560
Today, the France Branch is responsible for supporting the preaching work carried out in 2,000 congregations and 690 groups and pre-groups in 74 languages,

00:00:52.560 --> 00:01:11.329
preparing around 500 assemblies in 40 languages each year, organizing theocratic schools for pioneers, elders, circuit overseas and their wives, and the School for Kingdom evangelizers,

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:18.329
translating the publications into 14 languages, some of which involve remote translation offices.

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:29.329
Organizing a maintenance and renovation program for the 1555 Kingdom Halls and 10 assembly halls and constructing 20 new Kingdom Halls each year.

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.329
Added to this list is the providing of material, technical and financial support to congregations.

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:39.329
So, what is this project?

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:44.329
When you come to visit Bethel, your tour begins in the main office building.

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:51.329
Plans have been made to refurbish the ground floor and the reception area in order to increase the number of offices.

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:55.329
Afterwards, the upper floors will be renovated.

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:01.329
It is also planned to construct a new 35 apartment residence building.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:36.050
Another important part of this project is the renovation of buildings located in the industrial zone where the former printer was located.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:44.050
First of all, the parcel of land bordering the former printer will be converted into a parking lot.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.050
A new garage will be built in one of our former warehouses.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.050
The former printer building will be renovated and refurbished.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:01.050
On the ground floor, a new laundry and new workshops for the Bethel maintenance department will be installed.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:09.360
On the next floor, new offices and a new recording studio for the audio video department will be created.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:18.360
This department will then be better able to fill the growing need for dubbing and recordings of the publications available on the JW.org website.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:26.360
The upper floor, renovated in 2012 to 2013, is partially used to provide classrooms for Bible school courses.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.360
Rooms will be renovated in a joining buildings to accommodate the students.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.360
The other part of this floor is used by the translation department.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.360
The translation work done here benefits the numerous countries where French is spoken.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:04:01.219
The governing body would like this project to be completed by the summer of 2018.

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:04.219
How can we support this project?

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:11.219
If your situation allows you to volunteer, buy asking an elder in your congregation for an application form.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.699
Buy your contributions and buy your prayers.

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:30.839
We pray that Jehovah may bless this project which is geared towards intensifying the kingdom work in the territories under the France branch's care.
