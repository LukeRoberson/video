00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.600
Brother Harris, do you have a moment?

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.600
Sure, Fay. How can we help you?

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.600
Well, you probably heard by now.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.600
David and I got engaged this past weekend.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.600
We heard. Congratulations.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.600
We're so happy for both of you.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.600
Thanks so much. And since this is where I grew up,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.600
it would mean a lot to us if we could get married

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.600
in this kingdom hall.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.600
So we were hoping since you're the coordinator of the body

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.600
of elders, you'd be able to let us know

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.600
today if we can use the hall.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.600
Then David and I can start working on our wedding

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.600
invitations.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.600
Ask me to give you this letter making our official request.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:53.810
Yes, this is a good letter.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.810
This has all the information that we need.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.810
I'm going to check with the other elders

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.810
and we're going to discuss it.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.810
Then we'll get right back to you.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.810
Oh, you mean you can't tell me right now?

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.810
I thought since you're the coordinator,

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.810
you'd have the authority to, you know.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.810
I understand.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.810
But there is a theoretical arrangement

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.810
that we all have to follow, even the elders.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.810
And the arrangement is for the entire service committee

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.810
to discuss this, consider the matter thoroughly,

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.810
and before any approval is given.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.810
So I don't have the authority to make a decision on my own.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.810
Of course, that makes sense.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.810
I understand.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.810
But don't worry, Faith.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.810
We're going to get on this as soon as possible.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.810
Then you can move forward with your wedding plans.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.810
Thank you so much, Brother Harris.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.810
I really appreciate it.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.810
You're welcome.
