00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:16.079
53 years old. I was known as a troublemaker. I was fighting in the bars, come to a point where

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:24.660
you began to enjoy it. He was flat-out scary. He was a very mean and violent man. So everybody

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:32.539
kind of kept their distance from him. My language was too testable. I would make

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:37.340
go in men plus by the things that I could say and things that I would do. It was involved

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.799
with some bikers and they were trying to prospect me into getting into their club. Things

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:52.119
were escalating. We got married very young and we were 17. And had my oldest daughter.

00:00:52.119 --> 00:01:00.439
I was the mom and he lived a life of being out with his friends and partying. About that

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:04.540
time, my wife started studying the Bible, which I always witnessed. It was a big change

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.540
for her. But she explained the reason behind it. I couldn't argue with it. She talked me

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:19.019
into studying. I studied on 28 years old to 30. I always seen it. I always seen it. It

00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:23.659
was good. I knew this is where I needed to be. Somehow I just couldn't ever break free

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.180
of the person that I was. My mom always raised us in the truth growing up and that's what

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.659
we knew. So then to see my dad where he was so different, but yet believed it to be

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:43.019
the truth. And then to see that his lifestyle didn't do him any good was kind of a good example

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:50.540
of a bad example if that makes sense. I was afraid of the change. People accepted me

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:58.540
for who I was. Being a tough guy. Being Jimmy Brown. The scripture comes to mind. I

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.379
planted a polished water. God kept making it grow. Many brothers have studied with Jim from

00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:10.379
time to time over the years. I just happened to be the one at the time in his life when he

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:19.780
was taking the truth and running with it. Wanted to be a better person. Actually knew that

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:26.659
this was just not a way of life that I wanted anymore. He changed his friends. He changed

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:33.379
his life. He changed his dress and grooming. He changed his speech patterns. He changed the

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.539
way he was a grandfather. He changed the way it was a father. He changed the way it was

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:44.979
a husband. Everything changed about him. I knew of the work that witnesses do. Going out

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:49.300
toward the door, talking to people. I thought I could never do that. Whoa. Me going toward

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:55.180
the door. I'm going to run into people that I know that I drink with for years and years.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:01.900
How can I face them now? I had always told my wife would be much easier for you to become

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:09.340
a witness if I didn't live here. But how wrong I was. Because what a witness. My changes

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:19.340
have been to so many people in town. One of my favorite things to do is a bridge witnessing

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.419
with my granddaughter. People are fishing in the bridge. They're all night. I even have

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:29.500
returned visits that I do because people are regularly coming down the weekend to fish

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:36.300
on the bridges. I seize every opportunity. My kids laugh at me. Who witnessed to anybody,

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:43.020
anytime, anywhere. You'll see some raggedy tag, the old rough guy that he knew and brought to

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:50.699
the kingdom hall. In a few weeks he's got a new suit on, got a haircut, clean shaven. This is

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:58.139
the effect he has on the people that he comes in contact with. I love life now. I have two

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:06.639
friends. I know that I have hope for the future. Jehovah has seen something in me and he's brought

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:14.159
it to light. I am a good person. I can be a good human being. I can help other people. I can

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:22.670
be loved by him. It's a process.
