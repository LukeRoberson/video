00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:09.689
He was an old man, a very successful one.

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:13.330
He'd made a lot of money in his time.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:21.129
But let's not envy him, because for much of his life he was under a lot of pressure.

00:00:21.129 --> 00:00:23.609
His first marriage was a troubled one.

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.250
His wife was cold and critical.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.329
He'd raised a large family in the truth.

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:34.649
And some of his sons didn't turn out so well.

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.450
A few of his friends weren't there for him when he needed the most.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:46.299
He lost a child in death.

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:53.859
You may have guessed that we're talking about David, the writer of the 37th Psalm.

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:59.740
I was once young, he said, but now I am old.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:07.459
So here is an old man taking stock of his life and sharing a secret with us.

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:12.700
What was it that helped him to cope when everything around him was going wrong?

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.700
Let's find out.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.500
Let's turn to Psalm 37 and verse 4.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.900
This is the theme text for our discussion, so I'll give you a moment to find that.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.709
Psalm 37 and verse 4.

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:37.750
In David writes, find exquisite delight in Jehovah, and he will grant you the desires of

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:38.750
your heart.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.670
We're going to focus on the first part of the verse at this point.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.629
Find exquisite delight in Jehovah.

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:55.790
Exquisite delight, or maybe you say exquisite, whether you say exquisite or exquisite, we don't

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.950
use that expression very much, do we?

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.230
But look down at the footnote.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.150
It says, find your greatest joy.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:12.349
So David is saying, find your greatest joy in Jehovah, and he will give you the desire

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.030
of your heart.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.789
And that was David's secret.

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:22.949
He couldn't always count on his family life, and he never knew when a trusted friend

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:28.150
would turn against him, but he did know his God.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.389
He knew that Jehovah would never disappoint him.

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:36.389
Well, that's a good reminder for us, isn't it?

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.789
Humans may disappoint.

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:40.789
Jehovah?

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:42.310
Never.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.669
He is our North Star.

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:49.229
And so when we get lost or when we get confused, when we feel we've lost our way, we really

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:50.789
need to look heavenward.

00:02:50.789 --> 00:03:01.860
Look to Jehovah and let Jehovah be our greatest joy to know Jehovah is to love him.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.379
Now what do you do when you want to get close to someone, when you want to develop a friendship

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:07.379
with someone?

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.539
Well, you find ways to spend time with that person.

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:16.819
You want that person as a friend, and so you go about finding ways to spend time with

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.699
that person.

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:21.340
Well, it's the same with Jehovah God.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.620
We want him as our friend, so what do we do?

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.819
We look for ways to spend time with him, reading his word, meditating on his word, letting

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.659
it sink deeply into our heart.

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:40.819
And then the more we get to know Jehovah, the more we love him, and the more at ease

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.219
will be in his presence.

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:45.180
And that's where prayer comes in.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.219
We can develop a friendship with Jehovah that is so close, so intimate, that we can

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:57.979
confide in Jehovah things that we would never, ever tell another human on earth.

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:07.080
And the good news is that Jehovah wants us to get just that close to him.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.800
Well, we had big plans for this summer, didn't we?

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:19.360
Real conventions, regional conventions in all parts of the earth, happy times, warm fellowship,

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.319
and then the coronavirus.

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:27.800
Near the end of March, the governing body realized that we were going to have to make some important

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.560
adjustments as far as the conventions were concerned.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.279
But what to do?

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:35.279
All of the outlines had been prepared.

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:36.480
Forty-eight of them.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.040
Well, the teaching committee came up with an idea.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:46.040
Let's have the governing body, and many of the helpers deliver all of the convention

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:52.319
talks on the program, we'll record them, and then the brothers in all parts of the earth

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:56.519
will be able to enjoy the program in safety.

00:04:56.519 --> 00:05:02.279
Well this was going to be a tremendous job for a number of Bethel departments.

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:07.439
Sixty members of the broadcasting department here at headquarters worked tirelessly over

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:12.279
a three-week period to schedule and record the program.

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:17.680
And in the branches, thousands of energetic volunteers in our translation departments

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:25.000
produced the program in 400 languages, probably more than 400 languages when it's all done.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.279
And then, forty-four broadcasting departments in the branches also had to share.

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:38.319
So to all those who had to share in making this program possible, all those who were involved

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:44.199
in scheduling and recording and translating, we want to say thank you.

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:49.459
Thank you so very much for all you've done for us.

00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:54.740
Now speaking of broadcasting, do you think Jehovah has been preparing us for something

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.939
like this pandemic?

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:57.939
Think about this.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:05.860
A few years ago, the decision was made to set up something called JW Broadcasting.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:11.819
And at the time, who knew how practical an arrangement that was going to turn out to be?

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:17.139
And who knows what uses JWB will be put to in the future?

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:18.339
Jehovah knows.

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:19.939
Jehovah looks ahead.

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:25.660
Sometimes we don't know ourselves why certain decisions are made or why we are making certain decisions.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.420
But Jehovah knows.

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:31.459
Jehovah is our greatest joy.

00:06:31.459 --> 00:06:33.699
And here's another thing.

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:40.139
When the theme for this convention was being chosen, there was no coronavirus on the horizon.

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:44.420
Yet, can you think of a better theme for a convention than this one?

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.980
Joy.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.300
What an appropriate theme for a convention.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.980
Now, some of you have lost your jobs.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:57.300
Others have been very sick during the past few months.

00:06:57.339 --> 00:07:01.980
And a few of you have lost loved ones in death.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.660
There's no way you can be happy about those circumstances.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.740
But you can rejoice in your knowledge of Jehovah.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:14.660
You can rejoice in your knowledge of what Jehovah God has in store for us in the future.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.420
People outside don't have that.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:18.379
We do.

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:21.939
We rejoice in Jehovah.

00:07:21.939 --> 00:07:26.259
And did you notice how well our convention program matched up with the theme for

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:32.339
this year's, this year, the Eurotechs, make disciples, baptizing them?

00:07:32.339 --> 00:07:37.699
We had so much information on how to improve on our teaching skills.

00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:39.699
What do you think that is?

00:07:39.699 --> 00:07:43.980
Could it be that there's a lot more work to do in that respect?

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.379
Well, we don't know when the great tribulation is going to come,

00:07:47.379 --> 00:07:52.620
but we are determined to keep busy until the end does come.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:57.019
It wasn't a good idea to have us follow the progress of a Bible student,

00:07:57.019 --> 00:08:02.660
Jade, as Nita, overcame one challenge after another.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.100
That was realistic, wasn't it?

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.379
And what a transformation.

00:08:07.379 --> 00:08:11.019
Jade isn't jaded anymore.

00:08:11.019 --> 00:08:14.540
And there was a subtle message in those videos.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:18.899
We should never, ever trust first impressions.

00:08:18.899 --> 00:08:23.620
First impressions can be wrong.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.740
Well, whether you're conducting a study right now or not,

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:31.620
I'm sure you can hardly wait to get back to the field to apply some of those suggestions.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:35.899
What a wonderful part of the program that was.

00:08:35.899 --> 00:08:38.460
But what about other parts of the program?

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.779
Do you remember some of these highlights?

00:08:40.779 --> 00:08:45.059
Let's watch.

00:08:45.059 --> 00:08:51.649
There are millions of Jehovah's Witnesses around the world.

00:08:51.649 --> 00:08:57.450
Each finding a way to be joyful.

00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:03.490
Despite the trials we face, we can find joy.

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:13.950
In the choices we're making, in the families we're raising,

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:27.500
from the creation we're observing, from the peace we're promoting,

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:34.990
joy is found in the message we're preaching.

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:37.870
Jehovah promises us joy.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:44.149
Despite the trials we're enduring and persecution we're facing.

00:09:44.149 --> 00:09:49.029
He promises us joy through the stand we're taking.

00:09:49.029 --> 00:09:55.110
Through anything in life, you can find joy in Jehovah.

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:58.190
He wants you to be happy.

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:03.629
His joy can be yours now and forever.

00:10:03.629 --> 00:10:09.879
So will you accept it?

00:10:09.919 --> 00:10:16.080
Jehovah has the right to expect that we'll love him even more than we love our husband,

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:21.000
our wife, our son or daughter or our parents.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.399
He also has the right to expect that we'll love him more than we love our job.

00:10:25.399 --> 00:10:30.919
A favorite hobby or maybe a sport that we're passionate about.

00:10:30.919 --> 00:10:36.570
Jehovah has to come first.

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:42.090
Has your desire to put Jehovah first been tested during this pandemic?

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:47.690
You lost your job and you searched desperately for another one.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:52.049
Finally, after a long search, you found one.

00:10:52.049 --> 00:10:56.090
But it was a job that would require you to miss all your meetings and opportunities

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:58.690
for field service.

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:01.529
What a temptation to take that job.

00:11:01.529 --> 00:11:03.929
You went out of work for months.

00:11:03.929 --> 00:11:09.809
You felt helpless because a family member is supposed to provide for his family.

00:11:09.809 --> 00:11:18.570
He would take a lot of faith for you to refuse that job, pray to Jehovah and then wait.

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:24.740
Hold on a little longer to see what Jehovah would work out for you.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:30.620
Showing that Jehovah has to come first, even when it comes to providing for our family.

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:37.500
We have the example of the Jews who were returning from Babylon to Jerusalem.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:42.700
Now captivity in Babylon wasn't as harsh as slavery in Egypt.

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:50.700
Jews in Babylon could build a house, run a business, plant a vineyard, get comfortable

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:51.700
in life.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.340
Some of them even got rich.

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:59.460
Scholars believe that it was in Babylon, that the Jews learned about the art of buying

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:02.100
and selling trade and commerce.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:11.620
So it would take real faith on their part to leave their house, their business, close friends

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:18.860
and relatives who wanted to remain in Babylon and go to Jerusalem, a city with none of the

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:29.299
glitz of Babylon, a city that most of them had never seen, that would take real faith.

00:12:29.299 --> 00:12:35.259
While the returning Jews got off to a great start, they constructed the foundation of

00:12:35.259 --> 00:12:37.100
the temple.

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:39.940
But then they ran into problems.

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:42.220
There was danger.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:46.659
And so how would they show that Jehovah comes first in the face of danger?

00:12:46.659 --> 00:12:53.100
Well, they'd keep on building the temple in spite of the danger, but what did they do?

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:57.059
Well, they got scared.

00:12:57.059 --> 00:13:01.019
And they talked themselves into believing that it mustn't be Jehovah's will for them

00:13:01.019 --> 00:13:03.419
to build the temple.

00:13:03.419 --> 00:13:05.220
Why not?

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.419
Because it was hard.

00:13:07.419 --> 00:13:12.779
So they started looking after themselves, looking after their own interests.

00:13:12.779 --> 00:13:17.460
Now remember in Jerusalem, it was in ruins.

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:25.179
It wasn't going to be easy to start a business, plant crops and build a house in a ruined city.

00:13:25.179 --> 00:13:28.019
But they didn't say, oh, this is hard.

00:13:28.019 --> 00:13:32.299
So it mustn't be Jehovah's will for me to feed my family.

00:13:32.299 --> 00:13:34.700
They found a way to feed their family.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:40.059
Well, they should have had the same determination when it came to Jehovah's worship because

00:13:40.059 --> 00:13:44.299
Jehovah has to come first.

00:13:44.299 --> 00:13:47.059
Now these were good people.

00:13:47.059 --> 00:13:52.059
They had had enough faith to leave Babylon and return to Jerusalem in the first place.

00:13:52.059 --> 00:13:55.340
But that first love had cooled off.

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:57.740
And let's see how Jehovah felt about that.

00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:01.299
Let's turn to Haggai, chapter 1.

00:14:01.299 --> 00:14:05.500
We're going to read a few verses at Haggai, so keep your Bibles open there, please.

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.899
We're going to turn to Haggai, chapter 1.

00:14:08.899 --> 00:14:14.019
And first of all, we're going to read verses 2 through 6 to see how Jehovah felt about

00:14:14.019 --> 00:14:20.740
this choice that the Jews had made, putting themselves ahead of his worship in spite of

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:23.419
danger.

00:14:23.419 --> 00:14:27.019
This is what Jehovah's Army says.

00:14:27.019 --> 00:14:34.539
These people say, the time has not yet come for the house of Jehovah to be built.

00:14:34.539 --> 00:14:39.620
And the word of Jehovah again came through Haggai the Prophet, saying, is it the time

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:46.419
for you to dwell in your panelled houses while this house lies in ruins?

00:14:46.419 --> 00:14:52.500
Now this is what Jehovah of Army says, set your heart on your ways.

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:56.299
You have so much seed, but your harvest little.

00:14:56.299 --> 00:14:59.379
You eat, but it is not the satisfaction.

00:14:59.379 --> 00:15:02.700
You drink, but you do not drink your fill.

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:06.740
You put on clothing, but no one gets warm.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:14.500
The one who hires himself out puts his wages in a bag full of holes.

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:20.539
Now do you think Jehovah didn't want them to build a house, feed their family?

00:15:20.539 --> 00:15:26.019
Of course not, but Jehovah's worship has to come first.

00:15:26.019 --> 00:15:29.379
That's what exclusive devotion is all about.

00:15:29.379 --> 00:15:32.620
Well, what else do we learn from these verses?

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:34.419
What's Jehovah telling the people?

00:15:34.419 --> 00:15:36.019
He's saying, look at you.

00:15:36.019 --> 00:15:38.139
Your work can work and work.

00:15:38.139 --> 00:15:40.500
You're not getting anywhere.

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:46.340
You're not getting rich, and you aren't even making ends meet.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.340
Why not?

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:53.460
They didn't have the blessing of Jehovah, and it is the blessing of Jehovah that makes

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:56.139
rich.

00:15:56.139 --> 00:16:02.259
Now one of the scenes from our dramatic Bible reading illustrates this point very well.

00:16:02.259 --> 00:16:05.820
Let's remind ourselves, let's have a look.

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:10.340
Jehovah compares the results of the Jews' self-centered efforts to those of a hired worker

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:14.980
who puts his wages into a moth eaten sack.

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:20.500
Because the Jews are neglecting the house of Jehovah, he holds back his blessing.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:26.580
The results of the Jews' labor are limited, and their lives lack joy.

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:32.659
Evidently some try to feel that void by beautifying their own homes.

00:16:32.659 --> 00:16:37.220
Material things cannot satisfy spiritual needs.

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:40.500
Can we see the warning here for us?

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:47.700
It's not wrong to enjoy nice things, but material things cannot bring us true and lasting

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:55.450
joy, especially if we neglect Jehovah's work to obtain them.

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:58.330
Now there's nothing wrong with buying new things.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:01.690
I don't think many of us still have a black and white TV.

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:05.289
The point is, Jehovah must come first.

00:17:05.289 --> 00:17:10.130
And remember, the Jews were facing stiff opposition.

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:11.609
There was danger.

00:17:11.609 --> 00:17:15.730
So I want you to notice a little detail as we read Haggai 1, 7, and 8.

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:20.490
I told you to keep your Bibles open, I didn't, but I have forgot it again.

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:23.009
Haggai 1, verses 7 and 8.

00:17:23.009 --> 00:17:27.250
Now notice, the Jews are in danger.

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:29.769
There are opposers.

00:17:29.769 --> 00:17:34.809
But we're looking for a little detail that should have reassured the Jews, in verses

00:17:34.809 --> 00:17:37.690
7 and 8.

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:43.170
This is what Jehovah of armies says.

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:45.329
Set your heart on your ways.

00:17:45.329 --> 00:17:51.569
Go up to the mountain and bring in lumber and build the house so that I may take pleasure

00:17:51.569 --> 00:17:56.730
in it, and I may be glorified, Jehovah says.

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:58.890
Did you see it?

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:00.890
Jehovah of armies?

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:06.369
Now that expression is repeated over and over again in the book of Haggai, and it should

00:18:06.369 --> 00:18:12.809
have reassured the Jews that their enemies were nothing in comparison with Jehovah and

00:18:12.809 --> 00:18:14.690
his armies.

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:20.049
This is Jehovah telling the Jews, go ahead, build the temple.

00:18:20.049 --> 00:18:24.890
I have your back.

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:29.130
Find your greatest joy in Jehovah.

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:32.809
That's really the theme that we're talking about today.

00:18:32.809 --> 00:18:34.529
Let's talk about it.

00:18:34.529 --> 00:18:38.930
And let's talk about some aspects of this very important theme.

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:41.930
First of all, we'll talk about our relationship with Jehovah.

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:42.930
That's so important.

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:46.809
Now in the introduction to this talk, we mentioned David.

00:18:46.809 --> 00:18:54.329
He had a lot of problems, maybe more than most of us, and yet he never lost his joy.

00:18:54.329 --> 00:18:58.809
He found joy in his relationship with Jehovah.

00:18:58.809 --> 00:19:03.490
Now his physical living conditions weren't always the best.

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:07.650
When King Saul was alive, a David was on the run most of the time.

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:10.009
Where did he sleep?

00:19:10.009 --> 00:19:11.769
In a cave?

00:19:11.769 --> 00:19:13.930
In a place difficult to approach.

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:16.329
Just anywhere that was safe.

00:19:16.329 --> 00:19:21.930
And then at times David and his men ran low on food, sometimes they ran out of food.

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:24.529
Do you know the feeling?

00:19:24.529 --> 00:19:28.569
Have you been low on food during this pandemic?

00:19:28.609 --> 00:19:34.089
David couldn't even enjoy a normal married life because he'd married the daughter of Saul,

00:19:34.089 --> 00:19:37.809
but then Saul had given her to another man.

00:19:37.809 --> 00:19:40.529
So what got him through all that?

00:19:40.529 --> 00:19:42.930
His relationship with Jehovah.

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:46.529
Jehovah was the constant in his life.

00:19:46.529 --> 00:19:52.809
And you can just feel the unbreakable bond between Jehovah and David when you read the 16th

00:19:52.809 --> 00:19:53.809
Psalm.

00:19:53.809 --> 00:19:55.970
Now there's something very interesting about this Psalm.

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:59.670
Let's turn there.

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:05.869
And first of all, we're just going to look at verse 1 briefly.

00:20:05.869 --> 00:20:12.630
Psalm 16 had noticed in verse 1 the situation that David is in.

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:18.150
He is in need of protection.

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:22.670
In some unsated way, David is in danger.

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:25.670
But you know what's interesting about this Psalm?

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:28.630
For the rest of it, he doesn't dwell on his problems.

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:32.990
He dwells on the way Jehovah is helping him with his problems.

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:35.990
Notice verse 8.

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:42.269
David says, I keep Jehovah before me constantly.

00:20:42.269 --> 00:20:48.349
Because he is at my right hand, I will never be shaken.

00:20:48.349 --> 00:20:54.910
So with his eyes of faith, David could see Jehovah beside him, protecting him.

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:59.670
Now if we can have that vision, we're not going to be afraid of anything or anyone.

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:00.670
Are we?

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:04.269
Now find your greatest Jehovah.

00:21:04.269 --> 00:21:06.309
Here's a man who is in need of protection.

00:21:06.309 --> 00:21:08.509
Here's a man who feels he's in danger.

00:21:08.509 --> 00:21:10.430
Notice verse 9.

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:12.869
So my heart rejoices.

00:21:12.869 --> 00:21:15.509
My whole being is joyful.

00:21:15.509 --> 00:21:18.630
And I reside in security.

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:20.150
He's in danger in some way.

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:21.990
And yet he feels safe.

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:24.190
He feels secure.

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:29.670
In Notice verse 10, usually we apply verse 10 to the resurrection of Jesus.

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:32.589
But think of it from David's perspective.

00:21:32.589 --> 00:21:36.509
For you will not leave me in the grave.

00:21:36.509 --> 00:21:42.990
David knew that even if somehow he were to die, Jehovah would not leave him in the grave.

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:44.950
He would resurrect him.

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:55.640
At the end of verse 11, beautiful expression, in your presence is abundant joy.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.319
You notice the expressions?

00:21:57.319 --> 00:21:58.640
My heart rejoices.

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.880
My whole being is joyful.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:05.920
In your presence is abundant joy.

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.720
David's life wasn't always easy.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:14.480
But feeling that he was in the presence of Jehovah, feeling the support of Jehovah, helped

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:18.680
him to get through it and to get through it with joy.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:22.960
Well, your life isn't always easy.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:27.720
I'm sure you've had many anxious moments during this pandemic.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:32.039
But then you turn away from your problems.

00:22:32.039 --> 00:22:40.740
You focused on Jehovah God and you reset your joy returned.

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:44.220
How many reasons for joy can you think of?

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:46.940
The song says they're abundant.

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:47.940
Let's think of a few.

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.980
Here's one.

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:53.819
Jesus said, no man.

00:22:53.819 --> 00:22:59.579
No man can come to me unless the Father draws him.

00:22:59.579 --> 00:23:01.940
Now think what that means.

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:05.980
Jehovah saw something in you that he loves.

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:13.339
He looked down and he said, I want that person in the new world.

00:23:13.339 --> 00:23:16.140
Don't try to argue with Jehovah.

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:18.099
Don't say, you made a mistake.

00:23:18.099 --> 00:23:19.099
You don't mean me.

00:23:19.099 --> 00:23:23.700
You must mean the fellow next to me, but me, I'm not worth it.

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:36.579
Jehovah drew you to the truth, accept it, accept it, God loves you.

00:23:36.579 --> 00:23:40.980
Now that is a reason for joy.

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:44.579
Another reason for joy is that Jehovah answers our prayers.

00:23:44.579 --> 00:23:48.019
He's always available, always ready to listen.

00:23:48.019 --> 00:23:51.619
We can pray in any language at any time.

00:23:51.619 --> 00:23:58.420
But Jehovah won't always do what we ask him to do, but he will always listen.

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:03.779
We find joy in Jehovah's service because he's reasonable in what he expects of us.

00:24:03.779 --> 00:24:11.380
You come home after a long day's work, you're exhausted, worn out, stressed out.

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:16.579
You come home from field service or from a meeting, you're refreshed.

00:24:16.579 --> 00:24:18.619
Jehovah is reasonable.

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:25.740
We're also confident that Jehovah will provide our food and clothing no matter how dire the situation gets.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:31.299
Now, what he provides might not always be fancy, but it'll always be enough.

00:24:31.299 --> 00:24:34.660
It'll always be adequate to get us through.

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:41.779
And we should always be grateful for anything Jehovah provides, no matter how simple it might be.

00:24:41.779 --> 00:24:51.140
A researcher once drew a distinction between Jehovah's witnesses and some others who were in concentration camps in Nazi Germany.

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:54.940
Anon witness might say, where is the God?

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:59.980
All I have to eat is this miserable piece of bread.

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:06.579
A witness in the same camp might say, Oh, Jehovah, thank you.

00:25:06.579 --> 00:25:08.980
I have a piece of bread to eat.

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:20.299
I can eat and regain my strength and live just a little longer to serve you and maybe I'll be able to share some of my bread with someone else.

00:25:20.299 --> 00:25:27.579
The conclusion of the researcher will receive the piece of bread, but it was all in the point of view.

00:25:27.579 --> 00:25:38.579
The witness had a spiritual point of view and the witness was grateful for even a simple provision that Jehovah had made.

00:25:38.579 --> 00:25:43.299
Well, during this pandemic, it could be that your menu has been greatly simplified.

00:25:43.299 --> 00:25:47.460
Maybe you haven't been able to eat the way you would normally eat.

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:57.339
If you had just pasta or rice to eat, you didn't say, Look at this, all I have to eat is pasta, all I have to eat is rice.

00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:01.740
You thanked Jehovah for the rice or for the pasta.

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:11.660
You were grateful for the provisions and you realized that no matter how simple, these provisions came from Jehovah.

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:27.299
Jehovah has also given us a loving spiritual family and I think many of us have come to the conclusion that we never really understood what a loving spiritual family we have until this pandemic.

00:26:27.339 --> 00:26:32.339
A young married couple were both afflicted with the coronavirus.

00:26:32.339 --> 00:26:38.619
Both of them, well how would they eat? They couldn't go out shopping and they couldn't see anyone.

00:26:38.619 --> 00:26:44.059
The brother said, We had groceries at the door constantly.

00:26:44.059 --> 00:26:53.579
The wife says, I felt I had Jehovah's and everyone else's arms wrapped around me.

00:26:53.579 --> 00:27:02.099
Social distancing doesn't apply to Jehovah. He can wrap his arms around anyone.

00:27:02.099 --> 00:27:10.180
Many of our brothers have been reconnecting with long last return visits and I'm believing family members and starting Bible studies with them.

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:19.740
And as you probably know, meeting attendance has increased and inactive and disfellowship persons are also trying to draw close to Jehovah.

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:28.460
One disfellowship person said, I view this as one last warning from Jehovah.

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:36.700
Now just a word to any who may be listening, who are no longer serving Jehovah.

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:43.420
What are you waiting for? God loves you. God wants you to return.

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:51.660
He wants to put his arms around you once more. So please take advantage of the invitation and come back.

00:27:51.660 --> 00:28:02.660
And please don't give in to the idea, well I've done nothing up to now and now there's been a pandemic and if I come back to the truth, well Jehovah is not going to accept me.

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:12.539
Read your Bible. You'll find that in many cases it was a disaster of some sort that caused people to come to their senses and return to Jehovah

00:28:12.579 --> 00:28:20.460
and Jehovah lovingly accepted them. Think of Manasseh as an example.

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:27.140
Many have commented that they've actually drawn closer to their brothers and sisters during this pandemic.

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:33.619
Many, many say, I feel more cared for than ever.

00:28:33.619 --> 00:28:40.259
We find joy in our relationship with Jehovah and with our brothers.

00:28:40.259 --> 00:28:48.660
Now we were talking about David. He said in Psalm 16 that there is abundant joy in Jehovah.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:53.940
But what was his joy based on? It wasn't based on his privileges.

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:59.980
David didn't become king for years, but it was on his relationship with Jehovah.

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:07.819
So this is a good example for us. It may be that there's a privilege that you've been expecting that seems a long time coming.

00:29:07.859 --> 00:29:12.619
What do you do in the meantime? Keep working on your relationship with Jehovah.

00:29:12.619 --> 00:29:19.299
Keep strengthening that relationship. It'll be the best investment you've ever made.

00:29:19.299 --> 00:29:30.259
And don't forget, the greatest privilege any of us can have is to bear the name of Jehovah to be called one of Jehovah's witnesses

00:29:30.259 --> 00:29:39.059
and we're part of a family of brothers and sisters who love us and who would even risk their lives for us.

00:29:39.059 --> 00:29:45.099
So we've discussed finding joy in our relationship with Jehovah.

00:29:45.099 --> 00:29:55.819
Let's consider a second aspect. And that is finding joy in the Bible, finding joy in God's written Word.

00:29:55.819 --> 00:30:02.059
We get to know Jehovah best by reading His Word and meditating on it.

00:30:02.059 --> 00:30:08.299
Now in recent times, the congregation Bible reading has been shortened and there's a good reason for that.

00:30:08.299 --> 00:30:13.220
It's not so we can get our Bible reading over with and get on to other things.

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:21.339
It's so that we will take our time, slow down, meditate on what we're reading, chew it up, digest it thoroughly.

00:30:21.339 --> 00:30:26.420
This is Jehovah talking to you and to me, sharing His thoughts with us.

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:30.619
This is amazing and we need to appreciate it.

00:30:30.619 --> 00:30:37.779
Now one way that we can enjoy our Bible reading is to make the connection between what we're reading now

00:30:37.779 --> 00:30:42.019
and what we've read in the past and see how they match up.

00:30:42.019 --> 00:30:44.339
Let's take an example, just a short one.

00:30:44.339 --> 00:30:55.259
Turn to Numbers 12, Numbers 12, and verses 1 and 2.

00:30:55.259 --> 00:31:03.720
I think the setting is pretty self-explanatory, so Numbers 12, verses 1 and 2.

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:11.880
Now Miriam and Aaron began to speak against Moses because of the Cushite wife he had married

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:14.880
for he had taken a Cushite wife.

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:19.759
They were saying, is it only by Moses that Jehovah has spoken?

00:31:19.759 --> 00:31:23.920
Has he not also spoken through us?

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.079
So what was their argument?

00:31:26.079 --> 00:31:32.839
Basically, in plain English, their argument was that Moses was hogging the limelight,

00:31:32.839 --> 00:31:36.000
that he wanted to be the center of attention.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.519
And now, is that true?

00:31:38.519 --> 00:31:43.599
In the previous chapter, chapter 11, what do we read?

00:31:43.599 --> 00:31:52.640
Moses willingly shares his authority with 70 of the men of the elders of Israel.

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:58.319
So there was no serious question about Moses wanting to have the limelight.

00:31:58.319 --> 00:32:01.559
Moses was a humble man.

00:32:01.559 --> 00:32:05.559
But now, this is Numbers 12.

00:32:05.559 --> 00:32:12.039
This is Aaron questioning Moses' authority.

00:32:12.119 --> 00:32:17.000
But we can learn a little bit more about this from something that is tucked far away in

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.759
the book of Deuteronomy.

00:32:19.759 --> 00:32:22.960
Let's turn to Deuteronomy chapter 9.

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:28.440
And we're going to see if we can learn something about Aaron and why Aaron's attitude

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.759
was so shocking.

00:32:30.759 --> 00:32:36.839
Deuteronomy chapter 9 and verse 20.

00:32:36.839 --> 00:32:40.430
This is a revelation.

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:44.349
This is Moses, in the very last month of his life, talking to the Israelites.

00:32:44.349 --> 00:32:53.829
And he says, Jehovah was so angry with Aaron that he was ready to annihilate him.

00:32:53.829 --> 00:32:58.430
But I made supplication for Aaron.

00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:07.190
Aaron owed his life to Moses, and yet he dares question Moses' leadership of the nation

00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:08.990
of Israel.

00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:11.470
Aaron is really shocking.

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:15.269
Now what does this teach you about Moses?

00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:17.630
He's a very humble man.

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:19.829
And he's not quick to take credit for things.

00:33:19.829 --> 00:33:22.269
Now why do we say that?

00:33:22.269 --> 00:33:29.150
When Moses wrote the book of Exodus and the story of the golden calf, he never mentioned

00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:35.269
that Jehovah wanted to annihilate Aaron for his part in the golden calf incident.

00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:41.509
He was still alive, and Moses spared Aaron that indignity.

00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:49.029
It's only after Aaron's death, and in the very last month of Moses' life that we learn

00:33:49.029 --> 00:33:55.390
about it, doesn't that tell you something about how kind and humble Moses was?

00:33:55.390 --> 00:34:02.710
So this is just to illustrate the fact that if we try to take one point that we've learned

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:06.829
in the past and connect it up with what we're reading now, it will often help the Bible

00:34:06.829 --> 00:34:08.630
reading to come alive.

00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:14.469
Now let's consider some of the things that God's Word has done for us.

00:34:14.469 --> 00:34:17.670
Do you remember what it was like before you came into the truth?

00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:25.389
A favorite relative of yours who was happily married lost her husband in death.

00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:31.750
At the funeral, a priest told her that her husband was in purgatory, and unless the widow

00:34:31.829 --> 00:34:35.989
paid up, he was going to stay there for a long time.

00:34:35.989 --> 00:34:38.429
She just lost her husband.

00:34:38.429 --> 00:34:40.989
How comforting was that?

00:34:40.989 --> 00:34:44.309
But then you started studying the Bible.

00:34:44.309 --> 00:34:48.989
You came to Romans chapter 6 and verse 7.

00:34:48.989 --> 00:34:57.190
The one who has died has been acquitted from his sin, acquitted from his sin, and your

00:34:57.190 --> 00:35:00.070
Bible teacher explained what that means.

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:04.230
It means that when you die, the dead is paid.

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:07.230
You don't go on paying after death.

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:11.869
You don't suffer in hell, and you don't suffer in purgatory.

00:35:11.869 --> 00:35:19.760
That one Bible verse could completely change your view of what happens at death.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:25.800
On the other hand, maybe you grew up in a family where evolution was the order of the day.

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:30.239
So no hope, no hope for the future.

00:35:30.239 --> 00:35:33.280
This life is all there is.

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:39.199
Then you came to learn that you have a Heavenly Father who loves you very much, and who wants

00:35:39.199 --> 00:35:41.840
to give you a future and a hope.

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:46.519
What a joy it was to discover Jehovah.

00:35:46.519 --> 00:35:50.559
Some of us grew up in a family where the parents didn't get along so well.

00:35:50.559 --> 00:35:56.320
We couldn't point to them and say now that is how a man should treat his wife, or that

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:59.719
is how a woman should treat her husband.

00:35:59.719 --> 00:36:01.880
We just didn't get along.

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:02.880
We needed Jehovah.

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:03.880
We needed the Bible.

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:11.000
We needed Jehovah's organization to teach us how to have a happy family life.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.039
There's more.

00:36:13.039 --> 00:36:19.719
Recently a clergyman was asked by a journalist why pandemics like the coronavirus occur.

00:36:19.719 --> 00:36:25.960
And the clergyman answered, well, suffering is part of life.

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:28.000
That didn't answer the question.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.880
The journalist wasn't asking, do we suffer?

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:33.400
The journalist knew that we suffer.

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:37.239
The journalist wanted to know, why do we suffer?

00:36:37.239 --> 00:36:39.440
He didn't get an answer.

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:45.519
A professor of New Testament theology was asked the same question, why do we suffer?

00:36:45.519 --> 00:36:48.320
Do you know what he said?

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:50.239
Everybody suffers.

00:36:50.239 --> 00:36:52.519
God suffers.

00:36:52.519 --> 00:36:55.039
What kind of an answer is that?

00:36:55.039 --> 00:37:00.800
How happy we are to have the answers to those questions from the Bible.

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:08.000
Now speaking about God's written word, since 1966, Jehovah's organization has made the

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:13.719
Bible come alive in the most outstanding way through the Bible dramas.

00:37:13.719 --> 00:37:16.519
It really has made the Bible come alive, hasn't it?

00:37:16.519 --> 00:37:20.440
It's helped us to visualize what life was like in Bible times, and we've come to realize

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:25.000
that people living in Bible times weren't really so very different from people who

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.920
were living today.

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:32.159
Let's review a few scenes and see what lessons we can glean.

00:37:32.159 --> 00:37:41.030
Have a look.

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:42.030
Hey, Ham.

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:47.769
We had a visitor last night.

00:37:47.769 --> 00:37:52.579
It was your wife.

00:37:52.579 --> 00:37:54.179
Or should I say your former wife?

00:37:54.179 --> 00:37:56.920
Hey, Ham.

00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:00.119
Don't you care how you've hurt your innocent mate?

00:38:00.119 --> 00:38:02.000
How can you be so hardhearted?

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.880
Look, Moses said, if you find something indecent with your wife, a man must write a certificate

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:10.079
divorce, hand it to her, and dismiss her.

00:38:10.079 --> 00:38:15.480
If giving me no children is an indecent than what is, besides I'm tired of living with

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:20.119
her, I'm marrying Gisla today, Gisla.

00:38:20.119 --> 00:38:22.800
That Moe by girl?

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:27.480
I heard you bind yourself with an oath and a curse not to take away from the nations.

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:32.360
God's law says they will turn your sons away from following me to serve other gods.

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:37.360
When Jehovah's anger will blaze against you, who are you to counsel me?

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:41.480
Every man must find his own joy and I intend to find mine.

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:43.639
Hey, Ham.

00:38:43.639 --> 00:38:46.079
Only Jehovah can give true joy.

00:38:46.079 --> 00:38:57.079
Do you really think you can give yourself more joy than he can?

00:38:57.079 --> 00:38:59.239
What's the lesson?

00:38:59.239 --> 00:39:05.000
Our greatest joy comes when we obey Jehovah.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:14.219
Let's look again.

00:39:14.219 --> 00:39:16.219
Come back here.

00:39:16.219 --> 00:39:17.219
You have to listen to me.

00:39:17.219 --> 00:39:18.219
Your father.

00:39:18.219 --> 00:39:21.139
What's wrong with your children?

00:39:21.139 --> 00:39:23.099
They don't like coming to the temple.

00:39:23.099 --> 00:39:26.300
Oh, sweetie.

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:27.699
Why don't you like it?

00:39:27.699 --> 00:39:29.699
To walk out here.

00:39:29.699 --> 00:39:35.469
Come back here now.

00:39:35.469 --> 00:39:37.269
I'm sorry, my lord.

00:39:37.269 --> 00:39:40.900
My wife speaks very little Hebrew.

00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:42.179
Did you not swear?

00:39:42.179 --> 00:39:44.739
Never to marry someone who doesn't serve Jehovah.

00:39:44.739 --> 00:39:45.739
Nehemiah.

00:39:45.739 --> 00:39:47.739
Nobody cares.

00:39:47.739 --> 00:39:49.539
Did you not?

00:39:49.539 --> 00:39:50.539
Yes.

00:39:50.539 --> 00:39:52.619
Why have you ignored the command of Jehovah?

00:39:53.139 --> 00:39:54.460
And you're a whole no.

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:55.900
Let me go.

00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:59.619
No wonder your children don't love Jehovah.

00:39:59.619 --> 00:40:02.980
Did you imagine that you could succeed without Jehovah's blessing?

00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:04.380
I prayed for Jehovah's blessing.

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:05.460
Did you?

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:07.460
But you didn't obey him.

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:17.969
Rahim, how can Jehovah bless something that is against his will?

00:40:17.969 --> 00:40:24.769
And the lesson here, Jehovah doesn't answer prayers that are not in harmony with his will.

00:40:24.769 --> 00:40:33.670
And again.

00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:35.309
What was that all about?

00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:42.449
Rahim refuses to move into Jerusalem.

00:40:42.449 --> 00:40:44.130
And he wants us to support him.

00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:47.429
What did you say?

00:40:47.429 --> 00:40:52.139
I told him, he and Maya's doing Jehovah's will.

00:40:52.139 --> 00:41:00.719
Rahim doesn't understand how happy he could be if he would just follow Jehovah's direction.

00:41:00.719 --> 00:41:05.659
So we will move if we're selected.

00:41:05.659 --> 00:41:14.019
Yes, I'd rather be like Nehemiah and like Rahim.

00:41:14.019 --> 00:41:14.780
You agree?

00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:21.130
Yes.

00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:23.050
The lesson?

00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:28.010
Happy families follow Jehovah's direction.

00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:32.570
Well, there are a lot more lessons to be learned from this drama.

00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:36.610
And you can discover them as you review it at home.

00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:41.730
You guessed it, we're releasing the drama today.

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:44.690
You can access it following this talk.

00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:48.369
The chairman will show you how.

00:41:48.369 --> 00:41:53.739
You may applaud.

00:41:53.739 --> 00:41:58.099
So we find joy in our relationship with Jehovah.

00:41:58.099 --> 00:42:03.739
We find joy in studying his word and discovering beautiful things in his word.

00:42:03.739 --> 00:42:07.019
Now what about Jehovah's name?

00:42:07.019 --> 00:42:12.340
Can we find joy in Jehovah's name as well?

00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:17.139
Particularly in the last few years, a lot of emphasis has been placed on Jehovah's name

00:42:17.139 --> 00:42:24.260
while at Warwick, in the museum, we even have an exhibit about the divine name.

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:26.099
Now why do you suppose that is?

00:42:26.099 --> 00:42:30.500
Why do you think there's so much emphasis on God's name?

00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:36.900
Well, Jehovah loves his name and he loves those who love his name.

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:49.019
That's something we discover when we read Malachi chapter 3, Malachi chapter 3 and

00:42:49.019 --> 00:42:50.019
verse 16.

00:42:50.019 --> 00:42:55.440
I'll give you a moment.

00:42:55.440 --> 00:43:02.210
Malachi chapter 3 and verse 16.

00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:09.610
At that time, those who fear Jehovah spoke with one another, each one with his companion

00:43:09.610 --> 00:43:14.090
and Jehovah kept paying attention and listening.

00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:19.289
And a book of remembrance was written before him for those fearing Jehovah and noticed

00:43:19.289 --> 00:43:26.449
this and for those meditating on his name.

00:43:26.449 --> 00:43:33.730
And then in chapter 4 and verse 2, Jehovah praises those who honor his name.

00:43:33.730 --> 00:43:38.730
Now let's go back to this expression, those meditating on his name.

00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:40.489
What do you think that means?

00:43:40.489 --> 00:43:45.730
Surely, it means more than just accepting that God has a name.

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:47.369
We know that.

00:43:47.369 --> 00:43:52.889
The Jews and Malachi's day, even the unfaithful ones, knew that.

00:43:52.889 --> 00:43:59.730
But surely it means meditating on the meaning of God's name and meditating on the rule

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:04.929
that we can have in vindicating his name.

00:44:04.929 --> 00:44:12.289
As you know, many scholars believe that Jehovah's name means he causes to become.

00:44:12.289 --> 00:44:16.090
Jehovah can become whatever he needs to become.

00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:20.449
And he can make you become whatever he needs you to be.

00:44:20.449 --> 00:44:24.929
Now in the days of Israel, what did Jehovah need?

00:44:24.929 --> 00:44:26.329
Often he needed prophets.

00:44:26.329 --> 00:44:29.090
Where did he get them?

00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:30.809
From ordinary people.

00:44:30.809 --> 00:44:36.489
He took a very shy young man named Jeremiah and turned him into a bold and courageous prophet

00:44:36.489 --> 00:44:41.250
and he did the same with a farmer named Amos.

00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:46.889
You could tell Jehovah what you can and can't do.

00:44:46.889 --> 00:44:53.849
You might be surprised about what you can do if you just put yourself in Jehovah's hands.

00:44:53.849 --> 00:45:01.250
How many in this audience once said, I could never preach in norador.

00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:03.809
I could never pioneer.

00:45:03.809 --> 00:45:06.329
I could never be a missionary.

00:45:06.329 --> 00:45:10.050
I could never serve with a need is great.

00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:14.690
Well, Jehovah knew better.

00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:18.449
We can trust Jehovah in what he promises to do.

00:45:18.449 --> 00:45:20.769
He will always keep his promises.

00:45:20.769 --> 00:45:26.329
Now when you go through the Hebrew scriptures, you find certain expressions over and over again.

00:45:26.329 --> 00:45:28.250
The Jews rebel against Jehovah.

00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:31.650
They do terrible things, sometimes disgusting things.

00:45:31.650 --> 00:45:37.650
And you, the reader, are saying, Jehovah, you really ought to annihilate these people.

00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:46.010
It's terrible what they're doing, but then Jehovah reconsideres why?

00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:50.969
For the sake of my promise that I made to Abraham, for the sake of the covenant that

00:45:50.969 --> 00:46:02.210
I made with my servant David, for the sake of my name, to Jehovah a promise is a promise.

00:46:02.289 --> 00:46:08.090
He promised Abraham and David that he wouldn't forsake their offspring.

00:46:08.090 --> 00:46:10.369
And he meant what he said.

00:46:10.369 --> 00:46:12.769
Now think what that means.

00:46:12.769 --> 00:46:16.809
Nothing will make Jehovah go back on his word.

00:46:16.809 --> 00:46:21.210
When Jehovah promises that he's going to take this earth and turn it into a paradise,

00:46:21.210 --> 00:46:23.130
you can take that to the bank.

00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:27.369
Jehovah will keep his promise.

00:46:27.369 --> 00:46:32.449
How has Jehovah shown that a promise is a promise during this convention?

00:46:32.449 --> 00:46:35.050
What did he promise?

00:46:35.050 --> 00:46:38.530
My servants will eat.

00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:42.010
And the governing body had to find a way to serve the food.

00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:44.170
Jehovah provided the food.

00:46:44.170 --> 00:46:46.650
He provided it in abundance.

00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:48.449
And we thank him for it.

00:46:48.449 --> 00:46:54.090
All praise goes to Jehovah for this convention program.

00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:59.769
Now when we first discovered that God has a name, it was a turning point for many of us.

00:46:59.769 --> 00:47:03.170
A circuit overseer was going from door to door one morning.

00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:09.889
And at one door, a teenage boy answered, he announced that his parents were not at home.

00:47:09.889 --> 00:47:15.690
And the circuit overseer said, well, just before I leave, I'd like to show you something.

00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:22.449
And he showed the boy Jehovah's name in the Bible, Psalm 8318.

00:47:22.449 --> 00:47:28.650
The boy took the Bible to have a closer look, turned around, went into the house, and

00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:31.369
shut the door.

00:47:31.369 --> 00:47:39.170
With the circuit overseer's Bible, the circuit overseer waited, and waited, and he thought

00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:41.650
he'd lost his Bible.

00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:46.969
But then the boy's mother came to the door, and she apologized for pretending that she wasn't

00:47:46.969 --> 00:47:47.969
home.

00:47:47.969 --> 00:47:56.210
But she said she had been astonished to learn that God has a name, that led to a good witness.

00:47:56.210 --> 00:48:00.289
Well, what else do we know about God's name?

00:48:00.289 --> 00:48:06.409
The Bible says that the name of Jehovah is a strong tower, and we're going to be able

00:48:06.409 --> 00:48:12.449
to count on Jehovah during the attack of Gog of May Gog.

00:48:12.449 --> 00:48:19.929
When Gog attacks, Jehovah is going to vindicate himself, he is going to protect his people

00:48:19.929 --> 00:48:26.289
for the sake of his name, and that's another reason for us to love Jehovah's name, to

00:48:26.289 --> 00:48:34.210
rejoice in his name, because his name is involved Jehovah is going to protect his people.

00:48:34.210 --> 00:48:39.849
Well when we talk about the attack of Gog of May Gog, does it make you kind of nervous?

00:48:39.849 --> 00:48:42.570
Here are a couple of things to think about.

00:48:42.570 --> 00:48:48.969
First of all, whose idea is it for Gog to attack when he does?

00:48:48.969 --> 00:48:49.969
Let's find out.

00:48:49.969 --> 00:49:01.090
Ezekiel chapter 38, and we're going to start with verse 4.

00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:09.289
Ezekiel 38, beginning with verse 4, now this is Jehovah talking to that coalition of nations

00:49:09.289 --> 00:49:13.570
known collectively as Gog.

00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:17.809
And I want you to pay particular attention to the first part of the verse, that's verse

00:49:17.809 --> 00:49:18.809
4.

00:49:18.809 --> 00:49:32.769
Jehovah says to Gog, I will turn you around and put hooks in your jaws and bring you out

00:49:32.769 --> 00:49:36.369
with all your army.

00:49:36.369 --> 00:49:40.130
Now think about that, I will turn you around.

00:49:41.130 --> 00:49:46.650
It sounds like Gog was headed in the opposite direction, but then Jehovah turns him around

00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:50.050
and he draws him out to attack.

00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:52.010
So what does that tell you?

00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:56.369
The timing of the attack is Jehovah's.

00:49:56.369 --> 00:50:01.010
Now that doesn't mean that Gog of May Gog had no intention of attacking God's people.

00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:07.449
He was planning to attack at some point, but it's the timing of the attack, that's

00:50:07.449 --> 00:50:08.449
Jehovah's.

00:50:08.449 --> 00:50:10.610
The publisher book explains it this way.

00:50:10.610 --> 00:50:17.690
It says, as if putting hooks in Gog's jaws and leading him along, at some point following

00:50:17.690 --> 00:50:24.130
the destruction of Babylon the Great, Jehovah may in some way lure the nations into carrying

00:50:24.130 --> 00:50:27.530
out what is already in their hearts.

00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:35.130
Jehovah will thus set the stage for the attack that leads to Armageddon.

00:50:35.130 --> 00:50:37.929
So what are we worried about?

00:50:37.929 --> 00:50:42.170
Everything is happening according to Jehovah's purpose.

00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:50.170
Now when we read verses 10 through 12, we see what Gog has in mind.

00:50:50.170 --> 00:50:54.329
Ezekiel 38 verses 10 through 12.

00:50:54.329 --> 00:50:58.570
And then leave your Bibles open because we'll read one more verse.

00:50:58.570 --> 00:51:04.050
Versus 10 to 12, it says, this is what the sovereign Lord Jehovah says.

00:51:04.050 --> 00:51:08.650
In that day, thoughts will come into your heart.

00:51:08.650 --> 00:51:11.289
I wonder who put them there?

00:51:11.289 --> 00:51:14.210
And you will devise an evil plan.

00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:18.489
You will say, I will invade the land of unprotected settlements.

00:51:18.489 --> 00:51:23.690
I will come against those living in security, without disturbance, all of them living in

00:51:23.690 --> 00:51:28.690
settlements unprotected by walls, bars, or gates.

00:51:28.690 --> 00:51:33.809
It will be to take much spoil and plunder.

00:51:33.809 --> 00:51:36.050
But how will it all work out?

00:51:36.050 --> 00:51:38.570
Verse 23.

00:51:38.570 --> 00:51:47.050
And I, that is Jehovah, I will certainly magnify myself and sanctify myself and make myself

00:51:47.050 --> 00:51:55.210
known before the eyes of many nations, and they will have to know that I am Jehovah.

00:51:55.210 --> 00:51:57.449
So do we learn?

00:51:57.449 --> 00:52:00.690
Everything is under control.

00:52:00.690 --> 00:52:03.090
There's no need to panic.

00:52:03.090 --> 00:52:09.769
One is going according to schedule, Jehovah's schedule.

00:52:09.769 --> 00:52:11.489
So that's the first thing.

00:52:11.489 --> 00:52:14.050
There's another thing.

00:52:14.050 --> 00:52:17.050
What precedes the attack of Gog of Megog?

00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:20.050
What did we read in the pure worship book?

00:52:20.050 --> 00:52:23.409
The destruction of Babel and the Great.

00:52:23.409 --> 00:52:29.090
Now have you ever considered how that destruction is going to fortify your faith?

00:52:29.090 --> 00:52:34.730
It's going to strengthen you so that you're able to endure the attack of Gog of Megog?

00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:36.889
Think about it this way.

00:52:36.889 --> 00:52:46.130
What other religious organization foretells the destruction of a world empire of false religion?

00:52:46.130 --> 00:52:49.610
Were the only ones, because the others are all part of Babel and the Great.

00:52:49.610 --> 00:52:53.489
They're not going to foretell the destruction in the future.

00:52:53.489 --> 00:52:59.329
So the destruction is going to be a surprise to everyone, but Jehovah's witnesses.

00:52:59.329 --> 00:53:04.530
And when it occurs, there'll be no doubt in your mind that you're on the winning side,

00:53:04.530 --> 00:53:07.530
that you're on Jehovah's side.

00:53:07.530 --> 00:53:11.329
Some brothers get all upset over some detail.

00:53:11.329 --> 00:53:14.690
They don't think the organization has the right take on.

00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:19.969
It might be the pronunciation of God's name, or the meaning of that name, or the meaning

00:53:19.969 --> 00:53:22.210
of a single verse in the Scriptures.

00:53:22.210 --> 00:53:23.530
They get all upset.

00:53:23.530 --> 00:53:30.730
They get obsessed over one detail, and it interferes with their worship.

00:53:30.730 --> 00:53:36.849
But when Babel and the Great goes down, will there be any doubt as to which channel Jehovah

00:53:36.849 --> 00:53:40.409
God has been using all this time to do his well?

00:53:40.409 --> 00:53:46.119
You will be so glad that you're on the winning side.

00:53:46.119 --> 00:53:53.480
Of course it is sobering to think about the final attack of Gog of Megag on God's people,

00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:56.280
but it shouldn't take away our joy.

00:53:56.280 --> 00:54:04.880
Nehemiah 8 verse 10, it says, the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.

00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:09.320
Joy is actually a protection for us.

00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:12.639
Now did Nehemiah need a stronghold?

00:54:12.639 --> 00:54:14.559
You know the answer to that.

00:54:14.559 --> 00:54:21.519
His life was being threatened, pagan inhabitants of the land wanted to kill him.

00:54:21.519 --> 00:54:24.440
And then there were problems in the congregation.

00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:29.159
Some of the elders weren't respecting Jehovah's law on marriage, and the Sabbath wasn't

00:54:29.159 --> 00:54:30.440
being observed.

00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:34.679
And that was one of the reasons why the Jews went into captivity in the first place.

00:54:34.679 --> 00:54:42.039
There were problems, but Nehemiah didn't allow those problems to rob him of his joy.

00:54:42.039 --> 00:54:44.440
We too can be joyful.

00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:53.039
And when we're under a lot of pressure, our joy doesn't depend on our circumstances.

00:54:53.039 --> 00:54:57.639
Joy helped Jesus to endure a torturous stake.

00:54:57.639 --> 00:55:03.480
Joy motivated the apostles to keep preaching even after they've been beaten.

00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:09.920
The joy of Jehovah can help you to keep preaching, in spite of indifference, persecution,

00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:13.159
or any other obstacle.

00:55:13.159 --> 00:55:16.960
Well, maybe you feel that's what I need.

00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:18.440
I need more joy.

00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:23.239
Well, joy is an aspect of the fruitage of the Spirit.

00:55:23.239 --> 00:55:25.440
So when you need more joy, what do you do?

00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:28.920
How do you get more of Jehovah's Spirit?

00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:33.320
You ask for it, Father, give me more joy.

00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:35.719
I want to be joyful in my service.

00:55:35.719 --> 00:55:40.760
I want to rejoice in you.

00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:45.639
At the beginning of this talk, we read Psalm 37.4.

00:55:45.639 --> 00:55:53.360
And we focused particularly on the first part of the verse, rejoicing in Jehovah.

00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:56.559
Now, let's turn to the second part of the verse now.

00:55:56.559 --> 00:55:59.760
Psalm 37 and verse 4.

00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:05.150
And focus on that part for just a moment.

00:56:05.150 --> 00:56:11.269
So Psalm 37.4, the first part says, find exquisite delight in Jehovah.

00:56:11.269 --> 00:56:12.590
Amen.

00:56:12.590 --> 00:56:19.989
And he will grant you the desires of your heart.

00:56:19.989 --> 00:56:23.590
What does your heart desire?

00:56:23.590 --> 00:56:27.030
What are you looking forward to in the new world?

00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:29.550
Is it owning your own home?

00:56:29.550 --> 00:56:33.989
In some countries, maybe just having enough food to eat.

00:56:33.989 --> 00:56:38.190
Are you looking forward to doing work that you really enjoy or learning how to do something

00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:40.710
really well?

00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:47.630
Maybe you're older now and you're looking forward to waking up every morning without pain.

00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:50.230
And without wondering, I wonder what this pain means.

00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:58.909
I wonder if I have something serious and never, ever having to think about death again.

00:56:58.909 --> 00:57:04.150
Are you looking forward to conducting a Bible study with an unbelieving relative who returns

00:57:04.150 --> 00:57:07.510
or maybe with some historical figure?

00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:12.349
You know, this weekend, we learned that even faithful men of old, we're going to have

00:57:12.349 --> 00:57:17.590
to adapt to a different way of life and learn how to worship Jehovah in a way that will

00:57:17.590 --> 00:57:24.230
be acceptable to him, then, no Abraham.

00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:27.710
That child does not need to be circumcised.

00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:32.710
David, you're not a king anymore.

00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:38.420
If you want a glass of water, you have to get up and get it yourself.

00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:41.980
Samuel, I know you're grateful to be resurrected.

00:57:42.619 --> 00:57:46.179
But we don't offer animal sacrifices anymore.

00:57:46.179 --> 00:57:52.670
So please, put that knife down and leave that bull alone.

00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:57.230
Yes, there are going to be adjustments that have to be made.

00:57:57.230 --> 00:57:59.190
And what about living conditions?

00:57:59.190 --> 00:58:01.909
Where would you prefer to live in the new world?

00:58:01.909 --> 00:58:03.750
Maybe you loved the country.

00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:06.829
And if you're assigned to live in the country, you'll be very happy.

00:58:06.829 --> 00:58:11.030
But suppose you loved the country, but you're assigned to live in a city.

00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:13.469
Well, you can learn to love the city.

00:58:13.469 --> 00:58:19.710
Jehovah can help you to become whatever you need to become.

00:58:19.710 --> 00:58:23.750
Whatever you're given to do in the new world is going to be a blessing.

00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:29.429
Jehovah gives good gifts and perfect presence to his servants.

00:58:29.429 --> 00:58:34.989
And so Jehovah is going to make arrangements that are going to be for the ultimate good

00:58:34.989 --> 00:58:36.469
of all mankind.

00:58:36.469 --> 00:58:39.989
Now we don't know what arrangements will be made to clean up the earth just after the

00:58:39.989 --> 00:58:43.710
great tribulation, but we do know they'll be worked to do.

00:58:43.710 --> 00:58:49.389
And you may have the privilege of sharing in that.

00:58:49.389 --> 00:58:55.869
And think how you'll feel as you begin to move closer to perfection, both in mind and

00:58:55.869 --> 00:58:57.590
in body.

00:58:57.590 --> 00:59:03.989
At that time, David's words recorded at Psalm 139.14 are going to take on greater meaning.

00:59:03.989 --> 00:59:06.710
This is the last verse we're going to read during this convention.

00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:08.909
I'd like you to follow along.

00:59:08.909 --> 00:59:16.030
Psalm 139, and verse 14.

00:59:16.030 --> 00:59:20.150
Now this is imperfect David writing.

00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:30.550
Psalm 139.14, I praise you because in an awe-inspiring way, I am wonderfully made.

00:59:30.550 --> 00:59:33.190
Your works are wonderful.

00:59:33.190 --> 00:59:36.590
I know this very well.

00:59:36.590 --> 00:59:42.469
And was impressed by the way his imperfect body function.

00:59:42.469 --> 00:59:44.869
Can you imagine how he'll feel when he's perfect?

00:59:44.869 --> 00:59:47.349
You'll probably write another Psalm.

00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:54.909
Well, how do we sum up this heart-staring convention?

00:59:54.909 --> 01:00:01.750
The best way I can think of is for you to enjoy one final video, highlighting our reasons

01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:04.750
for joy now and for the future.

01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:10.389
Now, enjoy the video, but pay attention to the music because we're going to be singing

01:00:10.389 --> 01:00:13.230
that original song at the end of this program.

01:00:13.230 --> 01:00:16.150
We want everyone to sing.

01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:25.070
Everyone must sing, no just moving the lips, no faking, sing, but enjoy the video as well.

01:00:25.070 --> 01:00:50.340
The stars that fill us, summer night, look down from our bow, the beauty of the day

01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:55.019
and night, you fashioned with love.

01:00:55.019 --> 01:01:03.659
Your hands prepared the land and sea, and everything that came to be, broad joy to your

01:01:03.659 --> 01:01:04.659
heart.

01:01:04.659 --> 01:01:22.260
There is joy in your creation, in the message of salvation, and the paradise to go.

01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:29.079
But to have your love is a real and lasting treasure.

01:01:29.079 --> 01:02:10.030
You will will prove to be part of the things we hear and touch and see, and feel deep

01:02:10.030 --> 01:02:11.949
inside.

01:02:11.949 --> 01:02:29.159
You gave us such a perfect start, eternity in every heart and joy in our creation, in

01:02:29.159 --> 01:02:39.389
the message of salvation and the paradise.

01:02:39.389 --> 01:02:46.170
But to have your love is a real and lasting treasure.

01:02:46.170 --> 01:03:43.619
You will all will prove to be part of the things we hear and touch and see, and feel

01:03:43.619 --> 01:03:44.619
deep inside.

01:03:44.619 --> 01:04:39.719
You will all will prove to be part of the things we hear and touch and see, and feel deep

01:04:39.719 --> 01:04:40.719
inside.

01:04:40.719 --> 01:04:44.880
After that touching video, what more is there to say?

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:48.519
Find your greatest joy in Jehovah.

01:04:48.519 --> 01:04:49.840
Rejoice.

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:51.760
Our deliverance is near.
