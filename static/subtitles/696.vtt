00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:24.929
Although Numeir spoke a lot about Samuel, now we have the Son of Samuel conducting the next part of the program, or the Samuel Son,

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:32.100
and he will present student experiences.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:42.820
The theme, glorify your ministry, is based on Romans chapter 11 verse 13.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:54.820
Here the Apostle Paul said, now I speak to you who are people of the nations, seeing that I am an apostle to the nations, I glorify my ministry.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:02.820
Well Paul's attitude was that he viewed his ministry as an honor of the highest order.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.819
By taking advantage of every opportunity, not giving up in the House to House ministry,

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:14.819
we can demonstrate that we have that same view of our ministry.

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:19.819
I have brother David Alexander, one of our Gilead students with me,

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:26.819
and that we look forward to sharing some of the experiences that our Gilead students enjoyed over the past few months.

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:32.819
These experiences will show the results of their glorifying their ministry.

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:36.819
David, would you introduce our first reenactment?

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:50.310
Our first reenactment started off at sea level, and then climbed to 30,000 feet.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.310
Gentlemen, please sit down and fasten your seatbelt. We're ready to take off.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.310
Gentlemen, please sit down.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.310
Mama, I speak the language of the gentleman, and I would love to have.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.310
Could you please tell them they must sit down now. We're ready to take off.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.310
Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. You've saved the situation.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:22.310
I did the word Bible, teach us to do, and how do you view the Bible?

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.310
That is the question of this interesting thought. I encourage you to read it, please.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.310
Okay, thank you. I will be right back.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.310
Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. You've saved the situation.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.310
I encourage you to read it, please.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.900
Okay, thank you. I will.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.900
Did you know all these people?

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.900
No, but I felt that I had to help, and that is what the Bible encourages to do here.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:57.900
In Matthew, chapter 7, verse 12, it's a lead, all things, therefore,

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.900
that you want men to do to you, you also must do to them.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.900
This, in fact, is what the law and the prophets mean.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.900
What do you think about this?

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.900
Well, this is true, but we are also selfish.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.900
That is indeed our inclination.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.900
But look what I found in this interesting magazine that can help us

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.900
to apply Bible principles in our lives that lead to you this paragraph.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.719
Sure, that looks very interesting.

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:33.719
What beautiful results.

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:45.300
Thank you very much, friends, for your fine presentation.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.300
Now, in this occasion, Brother and Gany Mano was able to place 18 pieces of literature.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:56.830
He is obviously very prepared by performing just one act of kindness.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.830
He was able to open the way to give a witness.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.830
Yes, this helpful act was noticed by the priest on the plane,

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.830
ever not only read Jesus' words at Matthew 7-12,

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.830
that we must do to others as we would like others to do to us.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.829
But he demonstrated them.

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.829
David, we're still at an airport.

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.829
Please let us know what's coming up next.

00:04:22.829 --> 00:04:29.829
Our next reenactment takes place in the ground at the Custom Arrival Line of JFK Airport.

00:04:29.829 --> 00:04:34.829
Now, once again, the thought of taking advantage of every opportunity is being highlighted.

00:04:34.829 --> 00:04:37.910
Watch closely.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.910
It seems that we would be here for some time waiting in line.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.910
I could use the time to preach.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:50.600
But let me first make a brief prayer.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.600
Hi.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.600
Hello.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.600
Why are you visiting the US?

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.600
We are here on a business trip.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.600
We will stay only three days, and then we will fly back to Prague.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.600
And you? Why are you visiting the United States?

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.600
I am invited to the Watch Tower Bible School of Gilead.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.600
Watch school of what?

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.600
Could you repeat, please?

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.600
Yes, that's the school where we study for five months of the Bible.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.600
That sounds very interesting.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.600
I wonder what religion is that?

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.600
I'm one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.600
Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.600
I have never heard about the religion like that.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.600
Actually, I know Jehovah.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.600
It is God's name, right?

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.600
Yes, you are right.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:41.600
When I was a boy, one of my classmates told me that God's name is Jehovah.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.600
And ever since then, I am praying to God only by His name.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:54.600
Jehovah, I remember this name written on the card with books in our city.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:03.600
Every morning, I pass by this card, but honestly, I have never had time to really stop and talk to those people.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.600
You know, actually, I have something for you.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.600
I have this track that explains our website,

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.600
JW.org.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.600
You can find much information about God's name, Jehovah,

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.600
who he really is, and what good news he has for you.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.600
Thank you very much. That sounds very interesting.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:29.600
I think when we get back home, I will definitely stop by that card with books and talk to those people.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.600
You will not regret it.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.600
And have you ever wondered who God really is?

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.600
It is a good question.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.600
I don't know.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.600
You know, I have for you something else.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:49.389
I have a brochure called Good News from God.

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:53.389
Listen to his entitled, Who Is God?

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:58.389
I'm sure you will enjoy analyzing this brochure.

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:01.389
Thank you very much. We will read it with pleasure.

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:05.389
Well, your paper seems to be in order. Welcome to the United States.

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:06.389
Thank you very much.

00:07:06.389 --> 00:07:07.389
Thank you.

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:11.389
Oh, sorry. Now is my turn. I have to go.

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:13.389
Please check out our website.

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:17.389
And you can find more information about how to have a free Bible study.

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:19.389
Bye. Thank you. Goodbye.

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:37.750
Brother Samusen, what I appreciate about this experience is that Sister Estanya took the time to offer a brief prayer.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:40.750
Yes. I noticed that detail too.

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:45.750
Being prepared by having literature is important.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:53.750
But praying to Jehovah gives us the needed encouragement to go ahead and start the conversation.

00:07:53.750 --> 00:08:03.750
Well, our next experience, David, is in no way an encouragement for our transportation department to arrive late to pick up passengers.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:12.750
But let's see what Gilead students did when they found themselves in this very unusual situation.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:18.750
This experience took place at the passenger pickup area at the JFK airport.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.750
Well, there's a lot of people here.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:21.750
Yeah.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:24.750
But I don't see the brother to pick us up.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:25.750
No.

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:27.750
Hey, you cannot stand over there.

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:28.750
Oh, okay.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:29.750
Please stand over here.

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:30.750
Oh, sorry.

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:35.259
Sharon, let's hold up some tracks.

00:08:35.259 --> 00:08:36.259
That's a good idea.

00:08:36.259 --> 00:08:38.259
And this will also help the brother identify us.

00:08:38.259 --> 00:08:46.389
Okay.

00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:49.389
What is key to happy family life? Please tell me.

00:08:49.389 --> 00:08:52.389
It's a good question, isn't it?

00:08:52.389 --> 00:08:55.389
It's not what we think that's important.

00:08:55.389 --> 00:08:56.389
It's what the Bible says.

00:08:56.389 --> 00:09:02.389
And inside this tract, it says, happy are those hearing the word of God and keeping it.

00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:04.389
What do you think about that?

00:09:04.389 --> 00:09:06.389
I was married for several years.

00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:07.389
Then my wife cheated on me.

00:09:07.389 --> 00:09:09.389
I have no heart-trying, trusting people.

00:09:09.389 --> 00:09:11.389
I'm so sorry to hear that.

00:09:11.389 --> 00:09:14.389
A happy and lasting marriage doesn't happen automatically.

00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:16.389
But it is possible.

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:18.389
The key in the Bible is love for God.

00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:20.389
Well, that might be true.

00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:22.389
But now I have to go to direct more passengers.

00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:23.389
Okay, no problem.

00:09:23.389 --> 00:09:24.389
Let me leave you this tract.

00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:26.389
And on the back, you'll find our website.

00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:28.389
When you get home, you can go online.

00:09:28.389 --> 00:09:31.389
There's many wonderful articles from the Bible there for families.

00:09:31.389 --> 00:09:32.389
Thank you.

00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:33.389
Wow.

00:09:33.389 --> 00:09:34.389
He was nice.

00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:35.389
Yes.

00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:44.610
Actually, I noticed a lot of people looking at these tracks.

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:46.610
Do you have any more of these tracks?

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:50.610
I want to give to the flight attendants over there so they can read while they are waiting.

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:51.610
Oh, sure.

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:52.610
We have many different subjects.

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:53.610
I want them all.

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:54.610
Okay.

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:58.779
You should read these tracks.

00:09:58.779 --> 00:09:59.779
It's about the Bible.

00:09:59.779 --> 00:10:03.129
Where did you get these?

00:10:03.129 --> 00:10:04.129
From that couple over there.

00:10:04.129 --> 00:10:05.129
Okay.

00:10:05.129 --> 00:10:13.169
Hello.

00:10:13.169 --> 00:10:14.169
Oh, hello.

00:10:14.169 --> 00:10:15.169
I love reading the Bible.

00:10:15.169 --> 00:10:16.169
Really?

00:10:16.169 --> 00:10:17.169
Yeah.

00:10:17.169 --> 00:10:19.169
I just finished working a flight from China.

00:10:19.169 --> 00:10:23.169
And on the flight, one of the passengers has given me this tract in Chinese.

00:10:23.169 --> 00:10:25.169
But I can't read this.

00:10:25.169 --> 00:10:26.169
Oh, wow.

00:10:26.169 --> 00:10:27.169
This is the same organization.

00:10:27.169 --> 00:10:28.169
Oh.

00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:30.169
I have exactly the same tract for you in English.

00:10:30.169 --> 00:10:31.169
So you can read it.

00:10:31.169 --> 00:10:32.169
Okay.

00:10:32.169 --> 00:10:35.169
And on the back, you'll find out website jw.org.

00:10:35.169 --> 00:10:40.169
You can find Bible articles and Bible based articles in 700 languages.

00:10:40.169 --> 00:10:41.169
Oh, that's a good idea.

00:10:41.169 --> 00:10:42.169
Sure you'll enjoy looking at it.

00:10:42.169 --> 00:10:43.169
Thank you very much.

00:10:43.169 --> 00:10:44.169
Thank you.

00:10:44.169 --> 00:10:46.169
Excuse me.

00:10:46.169 --> 00:10:48.169
I would like to read the Bible too.

00:10:48.169 --> 00:10:49.169
Can I have one of those?

00:10:49.169 --> 00:10:50.169
Oh, sure you can.

00:10:50.169 --> 00:10:51.169
Yeah.

00:10:51.169 --> 00:10:52.169
Thank you.

00:10:52.169 --> 00:10:55.169
And on the back, you'll notice a website jw.org.

00:10:55.169 --> 00:10:58.169
You can find a lot more information about the Bible.

00:10:58.169 --> 00:10:59.169
Thank you very much.

00:10:59.169 --> 00:11:00.169
You're welcome.

00:11:00.169 --> 00:11:02.169
Such good territory here at the airport.

00:11:02.169 --> 00:11:07.429
Are you Danny and Sharon?

00:11:07.429 --> 00:11:08.429
Yes.

00:11:08.429 --> 00:11:09.429
Oh.

00:11:09.429 --> 00:11:10.429
I am here to pick you up.

00:11:10.429 --> 00:11:11.429
Oh, thank you.

00:11:11.429 --> 00:11:12.429
Sorry I was late.

00:11:12.429 --> 00:11:13.429
No problem.

00:11:13.429 --> 00:11:14.429
We had a great time here preaching.

00:11:14.429 --> 00:11:16.429
Let's share with you the experience.

00:11:16.429 --> 00:11:30.789
What a wise and practical use.

00:11:30.789 --> 00:11:35.789
Danny and Sharon made of the unexpected time that they had on their hands.

00:11:35.789 --> 00:11:37.789
Yes, they certainly did.

00:11:37.789 --> 00:11:40.789
And we know time is a very precious commodity.

00:11:40.789 --> 00:11:44.789
But because they were prepared, they were able to use the time wisely

00:11:44.789 --> 00:11:46.789
and they had good results.

00:11:46.789 --> 00:11:52.789
We too can also have good results if we take advantage of every opportunity.

00:11:52.789 --> 00:12:00.200
Well, now we'd like to introduce Brother Tamo Kahnstein.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:04.200
He's from Finland, attending our 139th class.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:07.200
Tamo, when you arrived at Patterson,

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:11.200
you had some doubts about your ability to start a Bible study.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.200
Would you tell us about your feelings?

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:17.200
Yes, when I arrived here, I was somewhat skeptical

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:22.200
whether I would be able to start and conduct a Bible study during these five months.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:27.200
I reasoned Saturday mornings would be difficult to find people at home.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:31.200
So, at some point, something changed.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.200
What was it?

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.200
Well, it was my attitude and prayers.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:41.200
After a month or so, I thought, well, Jesus not only commanded us to preach,

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.200
but also to teach.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:48.200
So, if I don't put for effort to start a Bible study, I don't pray about it,

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.200
I would be disobeying Jesus.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.200
Later, when one young man displayed interest,

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.200
the challenge was to find him home again.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.200
Well, I decided to pray about these two.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:05.200
I said, Jehovah, you are reading the hearts of the people.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:09.200
And if you are drawing this man to yourself,

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:14.200
could you please help me to visit him at times when he is at home?

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:19.200
Well, what difference did you change attitude and prayer make?

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.200
Well, within a month, I was conducting a Bible study,

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.200
and I was able to conduct the up till now,

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.200
and now I have passed the study to a local brother.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:30.200
Excellent. Thank you very much, Tamu.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:37.700
Appreciate those feelings.

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:42.700
David, isn't it true, as Tamu's experience shows

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:47.700
that having the right attitude opens the doors to talk about Jehovah?

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.700
Yes, that's certainly true.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:53.700
And we remember that we are witnesses on every occasion,

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.700
even when we eat at the restaurant.

00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:00.700
Let's watch closely the positive results some of our guilders' students had

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.980
when they enjoyed the meal.

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:05.980
Wow, that was a lowly meal.

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:08.980
Oh, yeah, it's like being at home in Turkey.

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:10.980
I love my spices.

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:14.980
Why don't we give the waitress some literature?

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:16.980
She was really nice.

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.980
I've got some English magazines and an English brochure.

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:21.980
That sounds like a great idea.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:23.980
I wonder if she speaks Arabic, too.

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:25.980
Does anyone have any Arabic literature?

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.980
Yeah, I have the latest magazines.

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:29.980
Ah, that would be great.

00:14:33.159 --> 00:14:34.159
Hi.

00:14:34.159 --> 00:14:35.159
Hi.

00:14:35.159 --> 00:14:39.159
I just wanted to thank you very much for that beautiful meal

00:14:39.159 --> 00:14:41.159
and your wonderful service.

00:14:41.159 --> 00:14:43.159
We all love the food.

00:14:43.159 --> 00:14:45.159
Are you welcome? Welcome anytime.

00:14:45.159 --> 00:14:47.159
My name is Faye.

00:14:47.159 --> 00:14:49.159
Can I ask what your name is?

00:14:49.159 --> 00:14:50.159
Lemya.

00:14:50.159 --> 00:14:52.159
Lemya. Nice to meet you, Lemya.

00:14:52.159 --> 00:14:53.159
Nice to meet you, too.

00:14:53.159 --> 00:14:54.159
Have you been here long?

00:14:54.159 --> 00:14:57.159
I've been working here about three months now.

00:14:57.159 --> 00:14:58.159
Three months? That's nice.

00:14:58.159 --> 00:15:00.159
And do you have any family?

00:15:00.159 --> 00:15:01.159
I have a daughter.

00:15:01.159 --> 00:15:02.159
You have a daughter?

00:15:02.159 --> 00:15:04.159
I keep a picture of her here.

00:15:04.159 --> 00:15:05.159
You want to have a look at it?

00:15:05.159 --> 00:15:06.159
Yes.

00:15:06.159 --> 00:15:08.159
Oh, wow.

00:15:08.159 --> 00:15:10.159
She's beautiful.

00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:12.159
She looks just like you.

00:15:12.159 --> 00:15:13.159
She's adorable.

00:15:13.159 --> 00:15:15.159
I love her very much.

00:15:15.159 --> 00:15:17.159
But you know, she's been sick lately.

00:15:17.159 --> 00:15:19.159
And I'm a little bit worried about her.

00:15:19.159 --> 00:15:21.159
And that's why I've got to work long hours

00:15:21.159 --> 00:15:23.159
to care for my family.

00:15:23.159 --> 00:15:26.159
I'm really sad to hear that, Lemya.

00:15:26.159 --> 00:15:28.159
Wouldn't it be lovely to live in a world

00:15:28.159 --> 00:15:30.159
where there'd be no sickness

00:15:30.159 --> 00:15:33.159
or even have the stress of making it living?

00:15:33.159 --> 00:15:35.159
Oh, yes. That would be great.

00:15:35.159 --> 00:15:38.159
You know, Lemya, I had these magazines.

00:15:38.159 --> 00:15:41.159
Do you speak Arabic or English?

00:15:41.159 --> 00:15:42.159
I can read both.

00:15:42.159 --> 00:15:43.159
I have both.

00:15:43.159 --> 00:15:44.159
Oh, these?

00:15:44.159 --> 00:15:45.159
They're very good.

00:15:45.159 --> 00:15:46.159
I love them.

00:15:46.159 --> 00:15:47.159
Oh, that's nice.

00:15:47.159 --> 00:15:49.159
I'm great. You like them.

00:15:49.159 --> 00:15:51.159
But can I ask you something?

00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:52.159
Yes.

00:15:52.159 --> 00:15:55.159
Why did you choose me to talk to?

00:15:55.159 --> 00:15:56.159
Why?

00:15:56.159 --> 00:15:59.159
I saw your beautiful smile.

00:15:59.159 --> 00:16:01.159
And I knew that you needed hope.

00:16:01.159 --> 00:16:05.159
Oh, you did see the pain in my heart, didn't you?

00:16:05.159 --> 00:16:08.159
Well, Lemya, God saw the pain in your heart.

00:16:08.159 --> 00:16:10.159
But what I'd love to leave with you

00:16:10.159 --> 00:16:12.159
is this brochure, good news from God.

00:16:12.159 --> 00:16:14.159
This will give you comfort.

00:16:14.159 --> 00:16:16.159
And I'd love to come back next week

00:16:16.159 --> 00:16:18.159
to get your thoughts on it.

00:16:18.159 --> 00:16:20.159
Oh, sure. Come back anything.

00:16:20.159 --> 00:16:21.159
Okay.

00:16:21.159 --> 00:16:28.379
So here, brothers,

00:16:28.379 --> 00:16:30.379
I enjoyed physical food,

00:16:30.379 --> 00:16:32.379
but also did not miss the opportunity

00:16:32.379 --> 00:16:34.379
to impart spiritual food.

00:16:34.379 --> 00:16:37.379
Let's see what happened one week later.

00:16:37.379 --> 00:16:39.379
Hi, Lemya.

00:16:39.379 --> 00:16:41.379
Good to see you again.

00:16:41.379 --> 00:16:42.379
Good to see you too.

00:16:42.379 --> 00:16:43.379
Do you have five minutes?

00:16:43.379 --> 00:16:45.379
I can share some points from the brochure.

00:16:45.379 --> 00:16:46.379
I left you last week.

00:16:46.379 --> 00:16:48.379
Of course, of course. Come and sit here.

00:16:48.379 --> 00:16:49.379
Thank you.

00:16:49.379 --> 00:16:57.720
So just after that paragraph,

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:01.720
I particularly wanted to share this scripture with you.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.720
Jeremiah chapter 29 verse 11.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.720
Would you like to read that please?

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:07.720
Yes.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.720
For I will know the thoughts

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.720
that I am thinking towards you

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:12.720
declares Jehovah,

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.720
thoughts of peace and not of calamity

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:17.720
to give you a future and a hope.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:18.720
Thank you.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.720
Can you see Lemya from there

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.720
what God wants to give you?

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.720
Peace.

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:25.720
Peace?

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:26.720
Anything else?

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.720
Oh, hope.

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.720
Can you imagine, Lemya,

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.720
the God of the universe wants to give you

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.720
peace, hope and a future?

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.720
That is so beautiful.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.720
I want to read this again later.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:40.720
That would be lovely.

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.720
Would you like a Bible?

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.720
I would love one.

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.720
What I know I bring one next time I come.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.720
Sure.

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:47.720
All right. We'll see you then.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:48.720
Bye.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:52.319
Well done sisters.

00:17:52.319 --> 00:18:04.339
Well, we're happy to report.

00:18:04.339 --> 00:18:08.339
We're happy to report that this study is progressing.

00:18:08.339 --> 00:18:10.339
Yes, and this highlights the value

00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:13.339
of not only leaving literature with people,

00:18:13.339 --> 00:18:15.339
but of being conscious

00:18:15.339 --> 00:18:17.339
to offer Bible studies.

00:18:17.339 --> 00:18:18.339
David,

00:18:18.339 --> 00:18:20.339
rather than just leaving literature

00:18:20.339 --> 00:18:22.339
in an informal setting,

00:18:22.339 --> 00:18:23.339
what could a publisher say

00:18:23.339 --> 00:18:26.339
that might lead to a study?

00:18:26.339 --> 00:18:28.339
Well, we could say Jehovah's Witnesses

00:18:28.339 --> 00:18:30.339
offer free home Bible studies

00:18:30.339 --> 00:18:31.339
in your local area.

00:18:31.339 --> 00:18:33.339
If you're interested,

00:18:33.339 --> 00:18:34.339
you can visit the website

00:18:34.339 --> 00:18:36.339
jw.org,

00:18:36.339 --> 00:18:37.339
watch a video

00:18:37.339 --> 00:18:39.339
about how the Bible study is conducted

00:18:39.339 --> 00:18:40.339
and request one.

00:18:40.339 --> 00:18:42.339
Well, that sounds good.

00:18:42.339 --> 00:18:44.339
By being Bible study conscious,

00:18:44.339 --> 00:18:47.339
we do glorify our ministry.

00:18:47.339 --> 00:18:49.339
Another way to take advantage

00:18:49.339 --> 00:18:51.339
of every opportunity is

00:18:51.339 --> 00:18:54.339
not to decide for others

00:18:54.339 --> 00:18:55.339
if they're too busy,

00:18:55.339 --> 00:18:57.339
or that they may not be interested

00:18:57.339 --> 00:18:59.339
in the Bible at all.

00:18:59.339 --> 00:19:00.339
The next experience

00:19:00.339 --> 00:19:02.339
will illustrate this.

00:19:02.339 --> 00:19:03.339
Hello.

00:19:03.339 --> 00:19:04.339
My name is Danny.

00:19:04.339 --> 00:19:05.339
This is my wife Sharon.

00:19:05.339 --> 00:19:06.339
Hi.

00:19:06.339 --> 00:19:07.339
I'm Mrs. Wong.

00:19:07.339 --> 00:19:09.339
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Wong.

00:19:09.339 --> 00:19:10.339
Where are you from?

00:19:10.339 --> 00:19:11.339
I'm from China,

00:19:11.339 --> 00:19:13.339
but I was in Hong Kong.

00:19:13.339 --> 00:19:14.339
Really?

00:19:14.339 --> 00:19:15.339
We live in Hong Kong.

00:19:15.339 --> 00:19:16.339
Okay.

00:19:16.339 --> 00:19:17.339
We're actually here

00:19:17.339 --> 00:19:19.339
for a five-month Bible study course.

00:19:19.339 --> 00:19:20.339
Oh, good.

00:19:20.339 --> 00:19:21.339
Have you ever read the Bible before?

00:19:21.339 --> 00:19:23.339
Yes, I like it very much.

00:19:23.339 --> 00:19:25.339
Sometimes people come here to eat

00:19:25.339 --> 00:19:26.339
and they live in magazine

00:19:26.339 --> 00:19:28.339
about the Bible for me to read.

00:19:28.339 --> 00:19:29.339
That's wonderful.

00:19:29.339 --> 00:19:32.339
Has anyone ever offered you a Bible study?

00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:35.339
No, but I'd love to have that one.

00:19:35.339 --> 00:19:36.339
Really?

00:19:36.339 --> 00:19:37.339
Well, what we have here

00:19:37.339 --> 00:19:39.339
is a Bible in Chinese for you.

00:19:39.339 --> 00:19:40.339
Okay.

00:19:40.339 --> 00:19:41.339
And this is a brochure

00:19:41.339 --> 00:19:43.339
that helps us to understand the Bible.

00:19:43.339 --> 00:19:44.339
So my wife and I

00:19:44.339 --> 00:19:45.339
can come back next week

00:19:45.339 --> 00:19:46.339
and we can discuss

00:19:46.339 --> 00:19:47.339
less than one together.

00:19:47.339 --> 00:19:48.339
Sure, thank you.

00:19:48.339 --> 00:19:49.339
Thank you.

00:19:49.339 --> 00:19:50.339
Say it again.

00:19:50.339 --> 00:19:58.930
Say it again.

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:00.930
What a fine example for all of us.

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:02.930
Now, although the lady was busy,

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:04.930
a brief witness was given

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:06.930
and a return visit was arranged.

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:08.930
Let's now see one week's pass

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:11.930
how this interest was followed up.

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:13.930
Good morning.

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:14.930
Is Mrs. Wong here?

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:15.930
Well, I'm sorry.

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:16.930
My wife is not here,

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:17.930
but she's coming back soon.

00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:19.930
So you're welcome to wait for her here.

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:20.930
Okay.

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:21.930
Thank you very much.

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:22.930
Actually, we left this Bible

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:24.930
for your wife to read last week.

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:26.930
Have you ever read the Bible before?

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:27.930
Yes, I studied the Bible

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:29.930
when I was growing up.

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:30.930
I like it very much.

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:31.930
Really?

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:33.930
Well, this brochure helps us understand the Bible.

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:35.930
Can I show you how it works?

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:36.930
Oh, yes, sure.

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:37.930
Oh, great.

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:39.930
We'll have a look here and listen one.

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:40.930
Hi, Mrs. Wong.

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:41.930
Hi, good to see you again.

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:42.930
You too.

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:45.930
I was thinking after we discussed the brochure today,

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:48.930
I downloaded some videos on my tablet

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:50.930
from our website, JDW.org.

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:51.930
Okay.

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:53.930
In Cantonese for you and your children.

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:54.930
Oh, good.

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:55.930
Would it be okay if we sit here?

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:56.930
Yes, it's it.

00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:57.930
Okay.

00:20:57.930 --> 00:20:59.930
I want to see the videos.

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:01.930
As a review, Mr. Wong,

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:05.930
did you notice in Jeremiah 29 verse 11,

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:09.930
who is it that promises to give us a hope in the future?

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:12.930
I think it is Jehovah.

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:13.930
That's right.

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:15.930
But do you know who Jehovah is?

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:16.930
Hmm.

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:18.930
Son of God.

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:21.930
Well, let's look at what the Bible says.

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:23.930
Actually, if you have a look at the scripture here

00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:26.930
in Jeremiah chapter 10 and verse 10,

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:29.930
who is Jehovah?

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:31.930
Let me see.

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:33.930
Oh.

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:36.930
Jehovah is truly God.

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:38.930
He is a living God.

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:40.930
Oh, you know, I got it wrong.

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:41.930
I didn't know this.

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:43.930
The living God is Jehovah.

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:45.930
I have no idea about this.

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:46.930
That's right.

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:47.930
So Jehovah is the true God.

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:49.930
But then who is Jesus Christ?

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:51.930
Well, if you have a look at this scripture

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:54.930
in Matthew chapter 16 verse 16,

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:56.930
who is Jesus?

00:21:56.930 --> 00:22:01.299
He is the son of living God.

00:22:01.299 --> 00:22:03.299
That's right. Good.

00:22:03.299 --> 00:22:04.299
So Jehovah is the father.

00:22:04.299 --> 00:22:05.299
He is the true God.

00:22:05.299 --> 00:22:07.299
Jesus is his son.

00:22:07.299 --> 00:22:08.299
They're not the same.

00:22:08.299 --> 00:22:12.299
In fact, in the scripture in John chapter 17 and verse 3,

00:22:12.299 --> 00:22:18.299
you will notice that God sent Jesus to the earth.

00:22:18.299 --> 00:22:20.299
So can Jesus be God?

00:22:20.299 --> 00:22:22.299
No.

00:22:22.299 --> 00:22:24.299
So according to this verse,

00:22:24.299 --> 00:22:27.299
what must we do to enjoy this beautiful future

00:22:27.299 --> 00:22:29.299
of everlasting life?

00:22:29.299 --> 00:22:34.299
I says we must come to know Jehovah God

00:22:34.299 --> 00:22:36.299
and he's son Jesus.

00:22:36.299 --> 00:22:37.299
Excellent.

00:22:37.299 --> 00:22:38.299
You got the point.

00:22:38.299 --> 00:22:41.299
Let's continue in lesson one.

00:22:41.299 --> 00:22:42.299
Wow.

00:22:42.299 --> 00:22:45.299
I enjoyed these videos very much.

00:22:45.299 --> 00:22:47.299
They're so helpful.

00:22:47.299 --> 00:22:50.299
You know, it's really hard to teach my children

00:22:50.299 --> 00:22:53.299
to show respect and avoid bad words.

00:22:53.299 --> 00:22:55.299
It's not easy these days, is it?

00:22:55.299 --> 00:22:56.299
Yeah.

00:22:56.299 --> 00:22:59.299
The Bible principles can really help our families.

00:22:59.299 --> 00:23:01.299
I'm surprised that your children said they saw

00:23:01.299 --> 00:23:05.299
two of these Caleb videos at their church camp.

00:23:05.299 --> 00:23:09.299
Next week to show you how we can use this publication

00:23:09.299 --> 00:23:11.299
to teach your children more Bible lessons.

00:23:11.299 --> 00:23:12.299
Sure.

00:23:12.299 --> 00:23:14.299
I look forward to it.

00:23:14.299 --> 00:23:15.299
Thank you very much.

00:23:15.299 --> 00:23:16.299
Really enjoy that.

00:23:16.299 --> 00:23:19.299
So please come back again next week to study more.

00:23:19.299 --> 00:23:20.299
For sure.

00:23:20.299 --> 00:23:21.299
See you next week.

00:23:21.299 --> 00:23:35.599
And this Bible study is also progressing well.

00:23:35.599 --> 00:23:36.599
Very good.

00:23:36.599 --> 00:23:40.599
And how good to see that the Gilead students did not assume

00:23:40.599 --> 00:23:43.599
that the restaurant owners were too busy,

00:23:43.599 --> 00:23:47.599
nor because of their background that they would not be interested

00:23:47.599 --> 00:23:48.599
in the Bible.

00:23:48.599 --> 00:23:52.599
Well, David, we've seen the good results of taking advantage

00:23:52.599 --> 00:23:56.599
of every opportunity in these different settings.

00:23:56.599 --> 00:24:00.599
But how did our Gilead students do in our primary opportunity

00:24:00.599 --> 00:24:04.599
to glorify God in the House to House Ministry?

00:24:04.599 --> 00:24:07.599
Well, even in territories that have been frequently worked,

00:24:07.599 --> 00:24:10.599
good results can be achieved if we have persistence

00:24:11.599 --> 00:24:13.599
and calling back on all interests.

00:24:13.599 --> 00:24:17.599
Let's now see an example of this in our next experience.

00:24:17.599 --> 00:24:20.599
We had a very nice day in the ministry this morning.

00:24:20.599 --> 00:24:22.599
Yes, what an awesome morning.

00:24:22.599 --> 00:24:25.599
This magazine is just perfect for this territory.

00:24:25.599 --> 00:24:27.599
Almost everyone accepted it.

00:24:27.599 --> 00:24:28.599
Yeah, it was great.

00:24:28.599 --> 00:24:31.599
So do you have any other activity here?

00:24:31.599 --> 00:24:34.599
Yes, I would like to take Amber with me on a call.

00:24:34.599 --> 00:24:35.599
That's okay with you.

00:24:35.599 --> 00:24:36.599
It sounds good to me.

00:24:36.599 --> 00:24:37.599
That's good.

00:24:37.599 --> 00:24:39.599
I would really like to follow up again

00:24:39.599 --> 00:24:41.599
on a lady from Ecuador.

00:24:41.599 --> 00:24:43.599
What happened on the call?

00:24:43.599 --> 00:24:47.599
She said that she likes her publications,

00:24:47.599 --> 00:24:49.599
but the only problem is she's very busy.

00:24:49.599 --> 00:24:52.599
We tried already five times to find her,

00:24:52.599 --> 00:24:54.599
but she was never at home.

00:24:54.599 --> 00:24:55.599
And because she's so busy,

00:24:55.599 --> 00:24:58.599
we told her that the good news was she was perfect for her

00:24:58.599 --> 00:25:00.599
because in just a few minutes,

00:25:00.599 --> 00:25:02.599
she could get the answer of her valuable questions.

00:25:02.599 --> 00:25:03.599
We asked her.

00:25:03.599 --> 00:25:05.599
What was the question she would like the answer the most

00:25:05.599 --> 00:25:06.599
and she said all of them.

00:25:06.599 --> 00:25:08.599
So we started out the first lesson.

00:25:08.599 --> 00:25:10.599
Wow, that sounds like an amazing call.

00:25:10.599 --> 00:25:11.599
I hope you get her home.

00:25:11.599 --> 00:25:12.599
We too.

00:25:12.599 --> 00:25:15.599
Well, it seems like we're ready to go.

00:25:15.599 --> 00:25:16.599
Good.

00:25:16.599 --> 00:25:17.599
See you there.

00:25:17.599 --> 00:25:27.269
Hola.

00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:28.269
Hello, Valkyrie.

00:25:28.269 --> 00:25:29.269
And I see you again.

00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:31.269
It's to see you too. How's your being?

00:25:31.269 --> 00:25:34.269
Well, busy. You know, I'm always on the run.

00:25:34.269 --> 00:25:37.269
Yes. I really enjoy your discussion last time.

00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:38.269
And if you have a minute,

00:25:38.269 --> 00:25:39.269
we can continue in the brochure.

00:25:39.269 --> 00:25:40.269
Who will lift off?

00:25:40.269 --> 00:25:41.269
Yes, I have a minute.

00:25:42.269 --> 00:25:43.269
Okay, to begin,

00:25:43.269 --> 00:25:45.269
we can read this scripture together.

00:25:45.269 --> 00:25:47.269
Would you like to read what it says?

00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:48.269
Sure.

00:25:48.269 --> 00:25:50.269
I have an Spanish Bible in my tablet.

00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:52.269
Maybe you want to use it.

00:25:52.269 --> 00:25:54.269
Oh, Kvien is an espanyol.

00:25:54.269 --> 00:25:56.269
And what application is this?

00:25:56.269 --> 00:26:00.269
This is a free JW Library Application from Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:26:00.269 --> 00:26:02.269
Very interesting.

00:26:02.269 --> 00:26:04.269
Can you install this application on my phone?

00:26:04.269 --> 00:26:05.269
Yeah, sure.

00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:13.180
And meanwhile, we can read this scripture together.

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:16.180
Sure, the Bible is very interesting for me.

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:20.809
What a very beautiful example of persistence.

00:26:20.809 --> 00:26:22.809
Thank you very much, friends, for this presentation.

00:26:22.809 --> 00:26:33.700
Now, in this experience,

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.700
the interested person was not home five times.

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:38.700
But the Gillian students did not give up.

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:41.700
And it resulted in the Bible study being started.

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:45.950
Yes, our Gillian students in every class

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:49.950
prove that even in well-worked territory,

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:52.950
by persistence, we can have good results.

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:56.950
David, what happened to Salveena and Eva,

00:26:56.950 --> 00:27:00.950
the other sisters that were continuing in their ministry?

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:03.950
Well, it seems they're just about to arrive at their return visit.

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:05.950
Let's take a look and see what happens.

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:08.950
So, Eva, I'm not sure who I'll get home today.

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:11.950
I've pretty well met the whole family, I think.

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:12.950
Really?

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:13.950
Yes.

00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:15.950
My first call I met Sarah,

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:17.950
and we had a very nice conversation.

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:20.950
Then I got Joyce, and then Michael,

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:22.950
and also nice conversation.

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:24.950
And then last I got John.

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:26.950
But this time, I sure hope to get Sarah home,

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:29.950
because I promise to share a point from the Bible Teachbook.

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:31.950
That would be really nice.

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:33.950
Okay, what don't we try?

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:34.950
Let's see what happens.

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:46.099
Here we go.

00:27:46.099 --> 00:27:48.099
Hello.

00:27:48.099 --> 00:27:49.099
Who?

00:27:49.099 --> 00:27:51.099
Is Sarah home today?

00:27:51.099 --> 00:27:53.099
No, she's not a home.

00:27:53.099 --> 00:27:55.099
She's not. What about Joyce?

00:27:55.099 --> 00:27:56.099
No, sorry.

00:27:56.099 --> 00:27:59.099
Okay, and Michael?

00:27:59.099 --> 00:28:00.099
Also not here.

00:28:00.099 --> 00:28:02.099
No, okay, and John.

00:28:02.099 --> 00:28:04.099
No, that's my dad.

00:28:04.099 --> 00:28:05.099
Okay.

00:28:05.099 --> 00:28:08.099
He wanted to visit his father that is dying.

00:28:08.099 --> 00:28:09.099
Oh, what's...

00:28:09.099 --> 00:28:11.099
He wanted to see him one more time before he dies.

00:28:11.099 --> 00:28:13.099
Well, I'm so sorry to hear that.

00:28:13.099 --> 00:28:15.099
Losing a loved one is not an easy thing.

00:28:15.099 --> 00:28:17.099
It's very sad and very hard to deal with.

00:28:17.099 --> 00:28:19.099
Yeah, you know, the last time I was here,

00:28:19.099 --> 00:28:23.099
I shared a thought from the book, this publication here.

00:28:23.099 --> 00:28:25.099
I have one for you too.

00:28:25.099 --> 00:28:26.099
This is your copy.

00:28:26.099 --> 00:28:27.099
Thank you.

00:28:27.099 --> 00:28:29.099
And there's a very comforting hope.

00:28:29.099 --> 00:28:34.099
Hope that the Bible offers us on page four of that book.

00:28:34.099 --> 00:28:37.099
And it's a scripture found in Revelation 21.

00:28:37.099 --> 00:28:39.099
Notice what God promises.

00:28:39.099 --> 00:28:43.099
He says here that he will wipe out every tear from their eyes

00:28:43.099 --> 00:28:45.099
and death will be no more.

00:28:45.099 --> 00:28:49.099
Neither will morning nor outcry nor pain be anymore.

00:28:49.099 --> 00:28:52.099
Can you imagine no more death?

00:28:52.099 --> 00:28:54.099
I lay that.

00:28:54.099 --> 00:28:56.099
When I was younger, I had more faith in God.

00:28:57.099 --> 00:28:59.099
And I was feeling closer to Him.

00:28:59.099 --> 00:29:03.099
But now, I want to feel in the same way again.

00:29:03.099 --> 00:29:06.099
You know, it's good to hear that you want to feel the same way again.

00:29:06.099 --> 00:29:09.099
And you can, by studying God's word,

00:29:09.099 --> 00:29:12.099
you can have that same feeling and draw close to God.

00:29:12.099 --> 00:29:15.099
Actually, my friend here, Eba, has a tablet

00:29:15.099 --> 00:29:17.099
which you would like to show your brief video

00:29:17.099 --> 00:29:19.099
of why study the Bible.

00:29:19.099 --> 00:29:20.099
Eba, would you help?

00:29:20.099 --> 00:29:23.099
Sure, if I may, I would like to show you the video

00:29:23.099 --> 00:29:32.680
why I just study a Bible.

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:38.599
From the moment we can talk, we ask questions.

00:29:38.599 --> 00:29:42.099
Why is the sky blue?

00:29:42.099 --> 00:29:44.099
What are the stars made of?

00:29:44.099 --> 00:29:48.410
Why do bad things happen?

00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:54.859
You will not believe this.

00:29:54.859 --> 00:29:57.859
But last night, I was praying to God.

00:29:57.859 --> 00:29:59.859
Please, God, tell me.

00:29:59.859 --> 00:30:02.859
There are so many bad things going on in my life.

00:30:02.859 --> 00:30:06.859
And now you are here at my door talking about God.

00:30:06.859 --> 00:30:09.859
I don't think this is coincidence.

00:30:09.859 --> 00:30:10.859
Why?

00:30:10.859 --> 00:30:13.859
I want to feel close to God again.

00:30:13.859 --> 00:30:16.859
You know, we appreciate your heartfelt expression

00:30:16.859 --> 00:30:19.859
for expressing yourself in that way.

00:30:19.859 --> 00:30:21.859
I would love to return with my husband

00:30:21.859 --> 00:30:24.859
and so that we can continue our conversation

00:30:24.859 --> 00:30:27.859
to see how you can draw close to God.

00:30:27.859 --> 00:30:29.859
Please do.

00:30:29.859 --> 00:30:31.859
As excellent example, friends.

00:30:31.859 --> 00:30:46.470
So here, sister was now able to give a witness

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:49.470
to a fifth person in this household.

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:51.470
Have you been prepared to speak about Jehovah?

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:54.470
Wherever we go, it resulted in a Bible study

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:56.470
with this young man.

00:30:56.470 --> 00:31:01.470
Yes, and our ministry certainly is a wonderful treasure.

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:06.470
As we've seen by taking advantage of every opportunity,

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:09.470
as well as sharing in the House to Housework,

00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:12.470
we glorify our ministry.

00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:16.470
Both avenues of the ministry require good preparation

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:20.470
in what we will say and what we will share with them,

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:23.470
either a scripture or perhaps some literature.

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:27.470
We hope that these experiences encourage all of you

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:32.470
to contribute or to continue zealously in your ministry.

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:35.470
We were only able to present a few

00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:38.470
of the good experiences our Gilead students had

00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:40.470
over the past five months.

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:43.470
We are very much appreciative of their diligence,

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:45.470
their hard work.

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:48.470
And we also appreciate and thank the help of all

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:53.470
who participated in sharing in these real experiences.

00:31:53.470 --> 00:32:01.640
Well, the next presentation is by Brother Daniel Fensum

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:05.640
and he will interview students.

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:08.640
Happy are the people who serve Jehovah.

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.640
That's his theme.

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:17.769
Psalm 144, 15 says,

00:32:17.769 --> 00:32:20.769
Happy is the people whose God is Jehovah,

00:32:20.769 --> 00:32:23.769
and Gilead students are a happy lot.

00:32:23.769 --> 00:32:26.769
It's not surprising really because, along with all of us,

00:32:26.769 --> 00:32:28.769
they're serving the one that the Apostle Paul talked about

00:32:28.769 --> 00:32:32.769
in 1 Timothy 111 as the happy God.

00:32:32.769 --> 00:32:34.769
So it's my pleasure to introduce to you

00:32:34.769 --> 00:32:37.769
four happy and nervous students.

00:32:37.769 --> 00:32:40.769
Sister Shirley Doody, who serves at the branch

00:32:40.769 --> 00:32:42.769
in the Solomon Islands.

00:32:42.769 --> 00:32:46.769
Brother Noah Dura Singham, who serves at the Sri Lanka branch office.

00:32:46.769 --> 00:32:49.769
Brother Daniel and Sister Natalie Lorenzo,

00:32:49.769 --> 00:32:53.769
who come from the branch in Congo, Kinshasa.

00:32:53.769 --> 00:32:56.769
Sister Doody is part of a translation team.

00:32:56.769 --> 00:33:00.769
Can you tell us please, what does your work involve?

00:33:00.769 --> 00:33:03.769
Before a team starts translating an article,

00:33:03.769 --> 00:33:06.769
they have to get the spirit of it.

00:33:06.769 --> 00:33:09.769
This means to understand it really well

00:33:09.769 --> 00:33:13.769
and to find out why that article was written.

00:33:13.769 --> 00:33:15.769
If it's a study article,

00:33:15.769 --> 00:33:18.769
the preparation is similar to how we would study,

00:33:18.769 --> 00:33:21.769
prepare for our weekly, watch our study,

00:33:21.769 --> 00:33:25.769
but the team will also be looking for language specifics.

00:33:25.769 --> 00:33:28.769
An example is, if an illustration

00:33:28.769 --> 00:33:31.769
will not be understood by our readers,

00:33:31.769 --> 00:33:35.769
we can ask for permission to either change the illustration

00:33:35.769 --> 00:33:38.769
or maybe tweak it a little so that our readers

00:33:38.769 --> 00:33:41.769
will get the point being made.

00:33:42.769 --> 00:33:45.769
When we prepare well and translate the article

00:33:45.769 --> 00:33:48.769
in a clear, accurate and natural way,

00:33:48.769 --> 00:33:50.769
our brothers and sisters will enjoy

00:33:50.769 --> 00:33:54.769
the same spiritual food enjoyed by Jehovah's people everywhere.

00:33:54.769 --> 00:33:58.769
Thank you. Can you tell us why does your work bring you happiness?

00:33:58.769 --> 00:34:00.769
The Solomon Islands speech and language

00:34:00.769 --> 00:34:02.769
is mainly a spoken language,

00:34:02.769 --> 00:34:05.769
so the translation department had to

00:34:05.769 --> 00:34:08.769
establish the written form of the language.

00:34:08.769 --> 00:34:11.769
This meant setting out grammar rules,

00:34:11.769 --> 00:34:15.769
making important decisions on the spelling of words,

00:34:15.769 --> 00:34:19.769
expressions, formal and informal things, and so on.

00:34:19.769 --> 00:34:24.769
It was exciting to be pioneers of the written form of the language.

00:34:24.769 --> 00:34:27.769
Now, seeing how far the language has come

00:34:27.769 --> 00:34:31.769
and how much our translation has improved,

00:34:31.769 --> 00:34:33.769
thanks to the training we received

00:34:33.769 --> 00:34:35.769
from Jehovah's organization,

00:34:35.769 --> 00:34:37.769
those are some of the things that give me

00:34:37.769 --> 00:34:39.769
a lot of happiness in my assignment.

00:34:39.769 --> 00:34:41.769
Thank you for those expressions.

00:34:41.769 --> 00:34:43.769
Brother Jura Singham, you work in the service department.

00:34:43.769 --> 00:34:46.769
Can you tell us a little about the work that you do, please?

00:34:46.769 --> 00:34:48.769
I'm helping in organizing

00:34:48.769 --> 00:34:51.769
the unassigned territory campaigns

00:34:51.769 --> 00:34:54.769
and providing territory boundaries to the congregations.

00:34:54.769 --> 00:34:57.769
And also, I'm answering the telephone calls

00:34:57.769 --> 00:35:00.769
from the field, especially from the special pioneers.

00:35:00.769 --> 00:35:02.769
And I help a little in organizing the conventions

00:35:02.769 --> 00:35:04.769
and theocratic schools.

00:35:04.769 --> 00:35:06.769
Very good. Can you tell us what is your work

00:35:06.769 --> 00:35:08.769
bring you happiness?

00:35:08.769 --> 00:35:10.769
Yes, helping the brothers in the field

00:35:10.769 --> 00:35:12.769
to do their best for the praise of Jehovah.

00:35:12.769 --> 00:35:15.769
It gives me a good feeling.

00:35:15.769 --> 00:35:18.769
And especially when I hear many good reports from the field,

00:35:18.769 --> 00:35:20.769
I really rejoice with my brothers.

00:35:20.769 --> 00:35:24.769
And some reports bring me some past memories.

00:35:24.769 --> 00:35:27.769
For example, me accompanied with my father

00:35:27.769 --> 00:35:29.769
traveled to many war-affected areas

00:35:29.769 --> 00:35:32.769
in the northern part of Sri Lanka and some islands.

00:35:33.769 --> 00:35:37.769
And now we are hearing many good reports from those areas.

00:35:37.769 --> 00:35:39.769
That really brings me so much joy.

00:35:39.769 --> 00:35:42.769
For example, to one small group,

00:35:42.769 --> 00:35:44.769
my father put me in front of the bicycle

00:35:44.769 --> 00:35:46.769
and traveled for 12 miles.

00:35:46.769 --> 00:35:49.769
And I remember sometimes we got down from the bicycle

00:35:49.769 --> 00:35:53.769
and we need to hide for the bombing aircrafts.

00:35:53.769 --> 00:35:57.769
And recently, when I see the congregation application form

00:35:57.769 --> 00:36:01.769
for that group, it really brought me so much joy.

00:36:01.769 --> 00:36:04.769
And now that congregation can ask for another group.

00:36:04.769 --> 00:36:06.769
And seeing these growths in the field,

00:36:06.769 --> 00:36:08.769
it really gives me so much joy.

00:36:08.769 --> 00:36:10.769
Thank you for sharing that with us.

00:36:10.769 --> 00:36:13.769
Sister Lorenzo works with the LDC office.

00:36:13.769 --> 00:36:16.769
Can you tell us what specifically it is your work involved?

00:36:16.769 --> 00:36:19.769
So we have around 20 teams of construction workers

00:36:19.769 --> 00:36:22.769
building kingdom halls and remote translation offices

00:36:22.769 --> 00:36:24.769
all over Congo.

00:36:24.769 --> 00:36:26.769
And every two weeks, they prepare a report

00:36:26.769 --> 00:36:29.769
of their accounts and send it to the branch.

00:36:29.769 --> 00:36:31.769
So it comes to our office.

00:36:31.769 --> 00:36:33.769
And with a team of other sisters,

00:36:33.769 --> 00:36:35.769
I share in checking those reports.

00:36:35.769 --> 00:36:37.769
We check the calculations.

00:36:37.769 --> 00:36:39.769
We assign the expenses to the right project

00:36:39.769 --> 00:36:41.769
and to the right category.

00:36:41.769 --> 00:36:43.769
And at the end of the process,

00:36:43.769 --> 00:36:46.769
we're able to calculate the final cost of kingdom halls

00:36:46.769 --> 00:36:48.769
once all the accounts is completed.

00:36:48.769 --> 00:36:50.769
So you crunch numbers all day?

00:36:50.769 --> 00:36:51.769
I do.

00:36:51.769 --> 00:36:54.769
And can you tell us how does your work bring you happiness?

00:36:54.769 --> 00:36:56.769
Well, it's opened my eyes to aspects of the kingdom work

00:36:56.769 --> 00:36:59.769
that I knew almost nothing about before coming to Bethel.

00:36:59.769 --> 00:37:02.769
Learning about the challenges faced by these construction teams

00:37:02.769 --> 00:37:04.769
has been a real eye opener.

00:37:04.769 --> 00:37:07.769
Sometimes they can be away from telephone network,

00:37:07.769 --> 00:37:09.769
away from access to medical care.

00:37:09.769 --> 00:37:13.769
And they have enormous difficulties in transporting materials

00:37:13.769 --> 00:37:17.769
to build kingdom halls in very remote locations.

00:37:17.769 --> 00:37:19.769
So seeing their spirit of self-sacrifice

00:37:19.769 --> 00:37:22.769
and their hard work puts my own difficulties

00:37:22.769 --> 00:37:24.769
into perspective.

00:37:24.769 --> 00:37:26.769
And also seeing the way that eventually

00:37:26.769 --> 00:37:29.769
all the obstacles are overcome to complete these projects

00:37:29.769 --> 00:37:33.769
convinces me that this can only be done with Jehovah's Holy Spirit.

00:37:33.769 --> 00:37:35.769
And so true.

00:37:35.769 --> 00:37:38.769
Brother Lorenzo, you work there in the service department.

00:37:38.769 --> 00:37:40.769
Can you please tell us a little about your work?

00:37:40.769 --> 00:37:43.769
So the main part of my work has been helping

00:37:43.769 --> 00:37:45.769
with the healthcare needs of special pioneers

00:37:45.769 --> 00:37:48.769
and circuit overseers and their wives.

00:37:48.769 --> 00:37:50.769
So this involves receiving phone calls

00:37:50.769 --> 00:37:53.769
regarding any situation they may be facing

00:37:53.769 --> 00:37:58.769
and looking into the best way to find treatment for them

00:37:58.769 --> 00:38:00.769
alongside the medical team in Bethel.

00:38:00.769 --> 00:38:04.769
And also we help in covering their medical expenses.

00:38:04.769 --> 00:38:07.769
Can you tell us what joy do you get from your work?

00:38:07.769 --> 00:38:09.769
Well, depending on the situations,

00:38:09.769 --> 00:38:12.769
sometimes the work can be very busy at times.

00:38:12.769 --> 00:38:16.769
But on several occasions, brothers and sisters

00:38:16.769 --> 00:38:20.769
have said that by just receiving a phone call or a letter

00:38:20.769 --> 00:38:22.769
they felt Jehovah was looking after them

00:38:22.769 --> 00:38:24.769
and that reassured them.

00:38:24.769 --> 00:38:26.769
So it's rewarding for me to see how brothers

00:38:26.769 --> 00:38:29.769
and sisters express their gratitude for Jehovah's Care

00:38:29.769 --> 00:38:31.769
through the work we do in Bethel.

00:38:31.769 --> 00:38:32.769
Thank you.

00:38:32.769 --> 00:38:34.769
Sister Deity, you've faced some challenges

00:38:34.769 --> 00:38:37.769
that could have robbed you of happiness in serving Jehovah.

00:38:37.769 --> 00:38:40.769
Could you tell us what those challenges were

00:38:40.769 --> 00:38:43.769
and how you've maintained your joy in service?

00:38:43.769 --> 00:38:46.769
In June of last year, our family received the news

00:38:46.769 --> 00:38:49.769
that my father had staged for cancer

00:38:49.769 --> 00:38:51.769
and only had months to live.

00:38:51.769 --> 00:38:53.769
That was devastating.

00:38:53.769 --> 00:38:57.769
When I offered to leave Bethel to help take care of him,

00:38:57.769 --> 00:38:59.769
this was what he said to me.

00:38:59.769 --> 00:39:03.769
Surely your mom and I have already given you to Jehovah.

00:39:03.769 --> 00:39:06.769
We have no intention of taking you back.

00:39:06.769 --> 00:39:08.769
You just stay where you are.

00:39:08.769 --> 00:39:11.769
Then five months later in November,

00:39:11.769 --> 00:39:14.769
I received my invitation to attend Gilead.

00:39:14.769 --> 00:39:17.769
Of course, my parents were so happy and I was overjoyed.

00:39:17.769 --> 00:39:20.769
But because of my father's situation,

00:39:20.769 --> 00:39:23.769
I told him I was willing to ask the brothers

00:39:23.769 --> 00:39:26.769
if I could come to a later class.

00:39:26.769 --> 00:39:28.769
His answer to me again was this,

00:39:28.769 --> 00:39:32.769
do you think Jehovah did not know my situation

00:39:32.769 --> 00:39:34.769
when he gave you this invitation?

00:39:34.769 --> 00:39:38.769
Don't worry, he will take care of me and your mother.

00:39:38.769 --> 00:39:41.769
Three weeks before I left home to come to Gilead,

00:39:41.769 --> 00:39:43.769
my dear father passed away.

00:39:43.769 --> 00:39:46.769
He was faithful to the end and he was right.

00:39:46.769 --> 00:39:49.769
But Jehovah was taking care of him

00:39:49.769 --> 00:39:52.769
in the safest place in the universe.

00:39:52.769 --> 00:39:56.769
That had already planned his resurrection party

00:39:56.769 --> 00:39:57.769
and I promised him.

00:39:57.769 --> 00:40:01.769
I would tell him about my Gilead experiences at that party.

00:40:01.769 --> 00:40:07.769
One of the many things that helped me during that very difficult time

00:40:07.769 --> 00:40:11.769
was keeping up with my spiritual routine

00:40:11.769 --> 00:40:14.769
and of course much supplication.

00:40:14.769 --> 00:40:19.769
I told Jehovah everything from my concerns, my fears,

00:40:19.769 --> 00:40:23.769
my worries, I told him the big things

00:40:23.769 --> 00:40:25.769
to the everyday little things.

00:40:25.769 --> 00:40:28.769
I personally experienced the peace of heart

00:40:28.769 --> 00:40:30.769
and mind that only Jehovah can give.

00:40:30.769 --> 00:40:33.769
That hardship also taught me this.

00:40:33.769 --> 00:40:35.769
Whatever happens in our life,

00:40:35.769 --> 00:40:38.769
if we continue serving Jehovah faithfully,

00:40:38.769 --> 00:40:40.769
the blessing he has in store for us

00:40:40.769 --> 00:40:43.769
will exceed anything we could have ever imagined.

00:40:43.769 --> 00:40:50.610
Thank you so much for sharing that with us.

00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:52.610
Brother Lorenzo, you faced a specific challenge

00:40:52.610 --> 00:40:54.610
that could have brought you of joy too.

00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:56.610
Could you tell us what that challenge was

00:40:56.610 --> 00:40:59.610
and then what helped you to overcome it?

00:40:59.610 --> 00:41:02.610
At times, I've had to deal with feelings of discouragement

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:05.610
related to various situations.

00:41:05.610 --> 00:41:08.610
For example, it happened that I felt discouraged

00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:11.610
because of adapting to Bethel's life

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:15.610
after spending several beautiful years in the field in Congo

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:18.610
or just dealing with imperfection,

00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:21.610
whether my own or the one visible around me.

00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:25.610
I realized that focusing too much on the source of discouragement

00:41:25.610 --> 00:41:28.610
would the time make me lose sight of the bigger picture

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:30.610
and why I was doing things

00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:32.610
and sometimes I would have the feeling

00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:34.610
that I was just struggling on my own.

00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:37.610
Among other things, one thing that really helped me

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:40.610
was my overseers in the department

00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:43.610
and also other brothers, even from the branched committee,

00:41:44.610 --> 00:41:47.610
who took the time to talk and listen

00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:51.610
and sometimes dropping everything for a while just to do that.

00:41:51.610 --> 00:41:53.610
And I saw Jehovah's hand in that

00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:55.610
because these brothers are very busy

00:41:55.610 --> 00:41:57.610
with all their responsibilities.

00:41:57.610 --> 00:42:01.610
But still, they behaved like shepherds and friends towards me

00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:04.610
and not just like overseers dealing with technical matters

00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:06.610
for their department.

00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:08.610
And that really helped me to make the difference.

00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:11.610
It helped me to refocus, take a step back

00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:14.610
and I'm sure that was Jehovah's way to pick me up

00:42:14.610 --> 00:42:16.610
in these more difficult times.

00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:18.610
Thank you for your honest comments.

00:42:18.610 --> 00:42:20.610
Sister Lorenzo, what lessons have you learned

00:42:20.610 --> 00:42:23.610
at Gilead that will help you to maintain your joy

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:24.610
in serving Jehovah?

00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:26.610
Well, studying in Jehovah's dealings

00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:28.610
with different individuals has made me realize

00:42:28.610 --> 00:42:30.610
even more how merciful and reasonable

00:42:30.610 --> 00:42:33.610
and kind Jehovah is with us.

00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:36.610
And we learned about Elijah when he was depressed

00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:39.610
and discouraged, Jehovah repeatedly listened to him.

00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:43.610
He reassured him by speaking to him in a calm low voice.

00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:45.610
And he gave him the rest and the food

00:42:45.610 --> 00:42:48.610
that he needed to cope with his assignment.

00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:51.610
Another one that touched me was the case of Jehoshaphat.

00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:54.610
We learned that at least twice he fell into the same weakness.

00:42:54.610 --> 00:42:57.610
He first of all helped Ahab and then later Ahaziah.

00:42:57.610 --> 00:43:00.610
But interestingly, when Jehovah summed up his record,

00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:04.610
he said, Jehoshaphat did what was right in Jehovah's eyes.

00:43:04.610 --> 00:43:07.610
So it struck me how deeply Jehovah understands us

00:43:07.610 --> 00:43:10.610
and rejoices not only over good actions,

00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:13.610
but even good reactions inside our hearts.

00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:16.610
I can see that Jehovah is very eager to look for the good in us.

00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:18.610
And I realize how proud he must be

00:43:18.610 --> 00:43:20.610
when we do the same for others.

00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:22.610
Thank you. Good points.

00:43:22.610 --> 00:43:25.610
Brother Lorenzo, could you tell us what did attending Gilead

00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:27.610
help you to learn about yourself?

00:43:27.610 --> 00:43:32.610
Well, Gilead has made me realize that I had a limited understanding

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:36.610
of what displaying the footage of the spirit really involves

00:43:36.610 --> 00:43:41.610
as we all are trying, I've been trying to display these qualities.

00:43:41.610 --> 00:43:46.610
But in class we learn that there is a difference between displaying the footage of the spirit

00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:50.610
and the natural ability one may have to show certain qualities.

00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:57.610
For example, one may be very patient when it comes to very good friends

00:43:57.610 --> 00:43:59.610
or when everything is going well.

00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:02.610
But then what happens when it's not so easy?

00:44:02.610 --> 00:44:04.610
Well, we tend to be less patient.

00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:08.610
And sometimes we find reasons not to be patient at all.

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:12.610
So in class we learn that Jehovah expects us

00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:15.610
to display the footage of the spirit on demand,

00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:20.610
when the situation demands it and not when it's convenient for us.

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:24.610
And this is only possible if we have the habit of relying daily

00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:26.610
on Jehovah's Holy Spirit.

00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:29.610
At that point we display the footage of the spirit

00:44:29.610 --> 00:44:33.610
and not just the footage of our own effort, which is not so consistent,

00:44:33.610 --> 00:44:35.610
particularly when times are difficult.

00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:40.610
So this made me realize how much more I need to rely daily

00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:45.610
on Jehovah's Holy Spirit, taking the time to meditate on His Word daily

00:44:45.610 --> 00:44:50.610
and setting time aside to pray specifically about the challenges our face.

00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:53.610
And hopefully this will help me to deal in the better way

00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:57.610
with the situation that tests spiritual qualities.

00:44:57.610 --> 00:45:01.610
Thank you, very true. Brother Jura Singham, can you tell us what lessons

00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:05.610
you learned at Gilead that will help you to maintain your joy in serving Jehovah?

00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:12.610
I learned that my joy is not dependent on where I serve but who myself.

00:45:12.610 --> 00:45:17.610
I learned the wonderful qualities of Jehovah in His dealings with His people,

00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:22.610
His love and mercy towards His slides, His forgiveness, loyalty,

00:45:22.610 --> 00:45:24.610
and love towards David.

00:45:24.610 --> 00:45:29.610
Already I know these accounts, but during the class I felt I am traveling

00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:32.610
with the Israelites, I was with David.

00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:36.610
The instructors actually took us to that particular situation,

00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:40.610
seeing Jehovah's qualities from that situation gave me so much joy

00:45:40.610 --> 00:45:44.610
because I am also serving that wonderful God, we are a vice.

00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:50.610
So I am sure if I have Jehovah in front of me by studying His Word

00:45:50.610 --> 00:45:53.610
as I did in Gilead, I can always find joy.

00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:55.610
Thank you for those good comments.

00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:58.610
Sister Doody, what did you learn at Gilead that will help you

00:45:58.610 --> 00:46:00.610
maintain your joy?

00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:06.610
The focus of Gilead now is to strengthen and stabilize Jehovah's organization.

00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:14.610
And the main way we can do this is to strengthen and deepen our own love for Jehovah and His people.

00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:18.610
Gilead took me to places I've never been in the Bible.

00:46:18.610 --> 00:46:23.610
One of the most outstanding things I've learned is the depth of Jehovah's love

00:46:23.610 --> 00:46:26.610
for us in perfect humans.

00:46:26.610 --> 00:46:32.610
Another lesson I learned is this, it matters to Jehovah how we treat others.

00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:38.610
If we treat them how He would in any given situation, He will always reward us.

00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:44.610
The reason He created us is to serve Him and to develop a close relationship with Him.

00:46:44.610 --> 00:46:51.610
So if I am obedient to His leadings and if I work hard to imitate His example in showing love

00:46:51.610 --> 00:46:58.610
and empathy to my brothers and sisters, that is a guarantee that I will be happy in my service to Him.

00:46:58.610 --> 00:47:00.610
Thank you very much for your comments.

00:47:00.610 --> 00:47:07.610
Your comments have highlighted some important factors in our maintaining our joy in serving Jehovah just to recap.

00:47:07.610 --> 00:47:11.610
Happiness comes from helping others to serve Jehovah, that's obvious.

00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:17.610
It's sustained by knowing that Jehovah understands us, as you were saying, and overlooks our imperfections.

00:47:17.610 --> 00:47:24.610
And I love the comment, happiness is dependent not on where we serve, but on whom we serve.

00:47:24.610 --> 00:47:33.610
Psalm 146 5 says, happy is the one who has the God of Jacob as His helper, whose hope is in Jehovah His God.

00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:39.610
It's our hope and prayer that Jehovah help you to continue to find happiness as you serve Him in your assignments.

00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:49.460
Well, we appreciate this presentation very much.

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:54.460
And now if you wish to stand, you can, and we will sing another song together.

00:47:54.460 --> 00:48:02.460
The song number 74, the theme is the joy of Jehovah, the joy of Jehovah.

00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:07.460
It's based on Nehemiah chapter 8 verse 10, song 74.
