00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:08.980
Many changes have been put in place over the past year with regard to how we construct, renovate, and maintain our kingdom halls.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.980
Have you wondered why changes have been made?

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.980
What do these changes mean?

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.980
And how can you have a share?

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:25.980
In January 2015, a video meeting was held with all elders in the United States explaining the new arrangement for building kingdom halls.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.979
We are confident you will enjoy excerpts from that program since these changes are being implemented around the world.

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:57.939
We are happy to bring this to you on JW Broadcasting.

00:00:57.939 --> 00:01:03.939
Bible prophecy indicates that the work of the earthly part of Jehovah's Organization will accelerate.

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:08.939
This requires many changes as we near the end of the system of things.

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.939
This is highlighted in Isaiah's prophecy, recorded in Isaiah chapter 60.

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:21.939
Verse 16 tells us that we would make use of the valuable resources of the nations in order to advance pure worship.

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:30.939
Verse 17 explains that progressive change would improve upon the previous arrangement, copper to gold, iron to silver.

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.939
And this would culminate in what is said in verse 22.

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:45.939
The little one will become a thousand and the small one, a mighty nation, I myself, Jehovah will speed it up in its own time.

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.939
We see these prophecies coming true.

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.939
It is thrilling to see what Jehovah is accomplishing in these last days.

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:57.939
As we know, however, all this advancement has a direct impact on our facilities.

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:08.939
As a number of kingdom proclaimers increase, more kingdom halls, assembly halls, school facilities, remote translation offices, and the expansion of branch complexes are needed.

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:20.939
Thus in October 2013, the governing body made sweeping adjustments to our work of designing, building, renovating, and maintaining our facilities.

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:26.939
The objective is to speed up the work in the most cost effective manner possible.

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:33.939
Included in this adjustment was a change to our approach for kingdom hall, construction, renovation of maintenance.

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:36.939
Why was a change needed in these areas?

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:41.939
There is a tremendous need for new and renovated kingdom halls around the world.

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:49.939
In fact, currently, there's a need for over 14,200 new kingdom hall and renovation projects.

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:54.939
While much of the program that follows is specific to the implementation in the United States,

00:02:54.939 --> 00:03:00.939
the process described as being carried out by all of our branches around the world.

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:05.939
This first report highlights the great need in the United States branch territory.

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:17.229
Thanks to Jehovah's blessing, we've seen outstanding growth in our branch territory.

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:24.229
This has led to numerous kingdom halls being used to their capacity and beyond.

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:34.229
For example, while there are many kingdom hall auditoriums in the United States branch territory that are attended by three congregations or less,

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:46.229
there are hundreds of kingdom halls that have auditoriums that are used by four congregations, and still hundreds more that are used by five or more congregations for auditorium.

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:53.229
Many of these kingdom halls are attended by multiple foreign language groups as well.

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:56.229
How critical is the situation?

00:03:56.229 --> 00:04:02.229
Let's consider a few statistics specific to the United States branch territory as a whole.

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:10.229
There are 977 kingdom halls with auditoriums used by four to six congregations.

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:21.230
These kingdom halls are located in 602 different cities and are attended by over 455,000 publishers.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:29.230
This represents nearly 35% of all publishers in the branch territory.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:38.230
Let's now consider just three of the many metropolitan areas in our branch territory that have an acute need.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:46.230
Los Angeles, California, Dallas, Fourthworth, Texas, and Miami-Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:59.230
In and around Los Angeles, California, there are 131 kingdom halls with auditoriums used by four to six congregations.

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:09.230
In and around Dallas, Fourthworth, Texas, there are 40 kingdom halls with auditoriums attended by four to six congregations.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:21.230
In the greater Miami-Fort Lauderdale, Florida metropolitan area, there are 48 kingdom halls with auditoriums used by four to six congregations.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:26.230
Now let's consider one specific example near Miami, Florida.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:36.230
There, within a 1.5 mile radius, there are two double auditorium and two single auditorium kingdom halls.

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:47.230
These four kingdom halls are attended each week by a total of 29 congregations representing 3,200 publishers.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.230
What a need!

00:05:49.230 --> 00:06:04.230
In these and many more areas throughout the United States branch territory, the lack of sufficient or suitable kingdom halls has become so severe that it is negatively impacting meeting attendance

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.230
and is restricting growth.

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:13.230
With a problem so large, we need Jehovah's help to solve it.

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:26.230
How exciting it will be to see Jehovah act quickly to provide the kingdom halls that are needed to make overcrowding a distant memory.

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:34.230
As the governing body considered these needs and reports from around the world, it became apparent that a change was needed.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:45.230
Thus in October 2013, it was announced that a new arrangement for kingdom halls under the oversight of the publishing committee of the governing body would be put in place.

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:52.230
What does this mean? This next report explains the organizational adjustments.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:59.230
The early formation of the Regional Building Committee arrangement began to loosely take shape in the early 1980s.

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:07.230
However, general guidelines outlining the structure of the program were produced in 1985.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:16.230
Then in 1989, the arrangement became even more formalized as it began to be implemented on a real wide scale.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:23.230
The organizational structure to provide oversight of this program came under the service committee of the governing body.

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:28.230
The service committee would give direction to the service departments in each branch.

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:36.230
A kingdom hall desk was established within the service department to oversee the work of the Regional Building Committees within their branch territory.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:48.230
Under this arrangement, the Regional Building Committees in the United States branch territory constructed some 4,000 kingdom halls using part-time volunteers.

00:07:48.230 --> 00:08:00.230
However, in the late 1990s, it was noticed that under the Regional Building Committee arrangement, some countries were still struggling to keep up with the growing need for new kingdom halls.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:09.230
In response to this need, the governing body instituted a new program in these countries to provide suitable meeting places at a more rapid rate.

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:14.230
This arrangement became known as the Lands with Limited Resources Program.

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:25.230
Under the Lands with Limited Resources arrangement, the publishing committee of the governing body gave direction to the Design Build Department to develop the program.

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:30.230
A kingdom hall construction desk was established and overseen by Design Build.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:40.230
That desk would provide oversight to a new category of special full-time servants formed into construction teams of up to eight people called Construction Groups.

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:50.230
Under the Lands with Limited Resources arrangement, over 27,000 kingdom halls were built in just 14 years.

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:55.230
Both of these programs were allowed to run in parallel since 1999.

00:08:55.230 --> 00:09:04.230
But as the organization continues to grow, the need for more kingdom halls has become urgent on an unprecedented scale.

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:19.230
For this reason, both programs were evaluated to determine what could be done to extract the best of both systems and come up with one united program worldwide to accelerate construction.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:27.230
Therefore, at the end of 2013, a new World Headquarters Department was formed under the direction of the publishing committee.

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:39.230
It is called Worldwide Design Construction, or WDC. It is responsible to oversee the scheduling and expediting of Worldwide Construction and renovation projects.

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:48.230
To assist them in this work, four regional design construction departments have been established in different parts of the world as extensions of WDC

00:09:48.230 --> 00:10:02.230
to administer construction for the countries in their region. Then in January 2014, the formation of the local design construction department, or LDC, was announced.

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:12.230
This branch-level department is responsible for the design, construction, and maintenance of kingdom halls and assembly halls in each branch territory.

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:20.769
To carry out the work in the field, teams of up to eight people are pointed under the direction of LDC.

00:10:20.769 --> 00:10:28.769
These teams, called construction groups, are made up of full-time construction servants and construction volunteers.

00:10:28.769 --> 00:10:37.769
With the combining of these two programs, there are no longer regional building committee or lands with limited resources programs.

00:10:37.769 --> 00:10:50.769
Instead, there is now one unified program to make the best use of organizational resources to accelerate the construction of much-needed houses of worship throughout the Earth.

00:10:50.769 --> 00:10:58.820
With all the work at hand, houses determine which projects to work on and when.

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:07.820
Each branch produces a maintains what is called a master plan. This next segment describes what this means in the United States.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:32.700
Under the direction of the United States Branch Committee, the local design construction department coordinates the construction, maintenance, and operation of over 6,000 kingdom halls, 50 assembly halls, and 1,300 special full-time servant residences.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.700
And that number will continue to grow.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:49.700
To meet the needs of the United States Branch territory over the next five years, at least 1,300 new kingdom halls will be constructed and another 1,600 more will be renovated.

00:11:49.700 --> 00:12:00.700
To help organize and prioritize this enormous task, a branch-wide master plan has been developed. What is a master plan?

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:12.700
It's a branch-wide plan that provides general locations for new kingdom halls presently needed, along with existing kingdom halls that need major renovation or replacement.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:16.700
How is a master plan developed?

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:27.700
The process begins with the collection of data. In cooperation with the service department, the LDC collects data on each current kingdom hall.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:44.700
This includes the number of congregations and language groups using the kingdom hall, the number of publishers in each congregation and language group, the average meeting attendance, forecasted growth, and reports on the physical condition of each building.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:56.700
By analyzing this information, areas of highest need become evident with high priority given to overcrowded and or severely deteriorated kingdom halls.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:15.700
Then, all the needs within the branch territory are initially arranged and sorted in a prioritized order. Finally, this list of needs is compiled into a branch-wide master plan and is annually submitted to the branch committee for approval.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:24.700
Upon approval, the master plan is then provided to the 8 remote LDC offices in the United States Branch territory.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:34.700
The LDC remote offices then dispatch field representatives to investigate, in-person, each kingdom hall on the list.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:47.700
The field representatives gather additional information from local elders, circuit overseers, and others about local circumstances that might impact how each need is cared for.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:14:10.100
Some of the local information collected that impacts the priority of the need is available vacancy at nearby kingdom halls, the effect of kingdom hall location on meeting attendance, the effects of overcrowding on meeting attendance, and the existing building's condition.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:16.100
Of course, unexpected events like natural disasters can have an impact too.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:26.100
Based on the local information gathered, the branch office reprioritizes needs across the entire United States Branch territory.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:35.100
The most critical needs are prioritized and filled first, and those with less critical needs are filled later.

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:44.100
How nice to know these decisions are not made arbitrarily, but rather objectively and theoretically.

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:49.100
Without a doubt, the needs in our branch territory are immense.

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:58.100
Thankfully, Jehovah has provided direction to develop a master plan that helps organize and prioritize our work.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:09.100
So, if your congregation has a critical need right now, you can be confident it will be filled quickly in an organized way.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:17.100
Until then, your continued patience shows generosity toward those with more urgent needs.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:25.799
In our video meeting with the elders, these introductory comments described why there was a need for change.

00:15:26.799 --> 00:15:33.799
Then, two members of the United States Branch Committee provided specific encouragement to the United States' field.

00:15:33.799 --> 00:15:49.799
At first, were the Harold Corcoran, a member of the United States Branch Committee and a helper to the publishing committee of the governing body, shared encouraging counsel in his talk, continued to rejoice, to be re-adjusted, to think and agreement.

00:15:50.799 --> 00:15:57.799
So, we invite you to open your Bibles to Ecclesiastes chapter 7, and we'll begin there in verse 19.

00:15:57.799 --> 00:16:09.799
And we've been talking about wisdom, wisdom from above, and there it says, wisdom makes a wise man more powerful than ten strong men in the city.

00:16:09.799 --> 00:16:18.799
When we have wisdom from above that is outlined, for example, there in the book of James chapter 3, well, we're going to be reasonable.

00:16:18.799 --> 00:16:23.799
We are going to yield. We're going to be ready to obey. We'll be peaceable.

00:16:23.799 --> 00:16:30.799
And all of those fine qualities allows Jehovah's Spirit to flow even further in our lives.

00:16:31.799 --> 00:16:43.799
Next, with keen interest, all in attendance pay close attention to Brother Leon Weaver, the coordinator of the United States Branch Committee, and a helper to the service committee of the governing body.

00:16:43.799 --> 00:16:48.799
He discussed the need for creating standards to accelerate the growth.

00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:58.799
Now, the faithful and discrete slave, the governing body has set a very fine example for us in setting forth arrangements to help us.

00:16:58.799 --> 00:17:10.799
If you remember last year, the faithful and discrete slave directed that the former loan arrangement would be done away with.

00:17:10.799 --> 00:17:18.400
So, no congregation now owes a loan to this arrangement.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:24.400
Well, what does this allow? This allows for true equalizing.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:42.400
Now, each of us individually and our brothers and our congregations can check himself, make a resolution that they're going to support this arrangement in a certain way through their own personal contribution.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:48.400
The urgency of this need for more kingdom halls has been made abundantly clear.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:54.400
Do you remember that prophet Isaiah also stated this in Isaiah 54 verse 2.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:18:00.400
Make the place of your tent more spacious. Do not hold back.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:07.400
Lune than out your tent cords and make your tent tend strong.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:13.400
So, this indicated we'd have this increase and we'd have to hand to it. Deal with it.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:25.319
Now, to accomplish the direction required takes Jehovah's people addressing this need to build.

00:18:25.319 --> 00:18:46.319
In an effort to keep pace with the current building needs, one of the things that has been decided upon is the development of standardized kingdom halls that lead in meeting the objective and that's to accelerate the building of kingdom halls in this time.

00:18:46.319 --> 00:18:51.319
The branch committee oversees the establishment of a standard design.

00:18:51.319 --> 00:19:04.319
The local design construction department under the direction of the branch committee works with kingdom hall design guidelines provided from headquarters and make sure that it is practical and modest.

00:19:04.319 --> 00:19:13.319
Each branch is assisted by the regional design construction department to ensure that standard plans are according to local circumstances.

00:19:13.319 --> 00:19:30.710
Let's take a look at the process that was used in the United States to determine what was necessary for a standard kingdom hall design.

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:36.710
In the past, the regional building committees would work with local elders to help to design and come up with the kingdom hall for that area.

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:46.710
Under the new program, one of the things that are exciting is a change in that now the branch committee is responsible for the standard kingdom hall for its territory.

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:55.710
Sometimes when I travel for circular assemblies or kingdom hall dedications, they ask you what is a branch committee, what do you do?

00:19:55.710 --> 00:20:02.710
The assignment of the branch committee is to implement the direction that the governing body gives it.

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:14.710
The way I explain it is like a body of elders. We have a group of men and to have oversight of the kingdom work in the scientific territory. And kingdom halls are part of that.

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:19.710
We report directly to the governing body, the various committees of the governing body.

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:27.710
Within each branch, the branch committee begins to determine where do we need kingdom halls? What is a kingdom hall? What kind of kingdom hall?

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:38.710
What's going to go in those kingdom halls? Once you begin to reach a standard, now when you apply the methods, things begin to fall in place, it gets simpler, you need less people, you go faster.

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:43.710
But the only way to do that is to come back to a single source. That single source is the branch committee.

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:50.710
Many of us on the branch committee wondered what part are we going to play in designing a standard kingdom hall?

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:58.710
Obviously we've been attending meetings in kingdom halls for many decades, so we had some background in that regard.

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:05.710
We've been in kingdom halls and have all types of designs. We have seen the good, we have seen the ugly.

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:12.710
We have our traveling brothers who give us input as to things that they think might help the kingdom halls.

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:19.710
We all come from different parts of the country, and a number of us on the branch committee have served in the traveling world.

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:22.710
So we've been in hundreds of kingdom halls over the years.

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:31.710
I know I went to one kingdom hall in San Diego. The kingdom hall sign out front was in five different languages.

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:36.710
That's, of course, big cities, but even smaller cities now.

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:45.710
They're having foreign language group, I would say, in South Dakota, they're forming a group with Napoli.

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:49.710
Well, who would have thought Napoli in South Dakota?

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:54.710
They travel all around, what is their territory? They speak to their brothers, they go to the kingdom halls, they see what's out there.

00:21:54.710 --> 00:22:01.710
So with that knowledge, they bring that forward and say, here's what we feel the kingdom halls in the United States would do well with.

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:11.710
As far as experience, we may be in Bethel, but we've got a lot of experience when it comes to kingdom halls and construction.

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:16.710
So you've got 16 men, you would need to find out what do they expect to see in a kingdom hall.

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:21.710
A questionnaire was presented, it had options that a kingdom hall could include.

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:28.710
And through that process, then it enabled the branch committee to begin to go down and select things that they felt absolutely were necessary in a kingdom hall,

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:31.710
versus things that were not absolutely necessary.

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:37.710
And now you begin to refine and focus what should the standard kingdom hall look like and what would the end result be.

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:40.710
It was a five-page document.

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:45.710
And the first thought I had was, why do we need to go through all of this?

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:47.710
Everyone's got their own likes and dislikes.

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:53.710
So a questionnaire is a means to go through and find out where the common denominators are.

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:56.710
This questionnaire really started to prompt our minds.

00:22:56.710 --> 00:23:00.710
It was very beneficial, it helped solidify our thinking.

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:08.710
We were able to analyze the various functions that every kingdom hall should have.

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:10.710
It all came to an agreement.

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:17.710
And in the end, our entire branch committee would agree on various aspects of what would go into the standard kingdom hall.

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:21.710
But it was a process getting to that point.

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:37.710
I think having seen the final presentation that the brothers made, I think the entire branch committee felt a great level of confidence that this is a standard design

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:40.710
that is going to be well received by the brothers in the field.

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:46.710
For us to be able to sit there and see what we had worked on for months,

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:50.710
we really felt as though we could take possession of this kingdom hall.

00:23:50.710 --> 00:24:00.710
And we expect that our brothers and sisters and our elders that are going to be involved in building these kingdom halls will be extremely appreciative.

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:11.059
And they'll be as excited as we are as a branch committee.

00:24:11.059 --> 00:24:17.059
As we would expect coming to an agreement on a standard kingdom hall design is not a simple process.

00:24:17.059 --> 00:24:23.059
You will find it adventurous to hear how this worked out in the United States branch.

00:24:23.059 --> 00:24:38.619
So the group of us working on the design came from RBC backgrounds.

00:24:38.619 --> 00:24:42.619
And we tried to apply RBC knowledge to this new approach.

00:24:42.619 --> 00:24:48.619
There were several things about the old design that made it difficult to construct.

00:24:48.619 --> 00:24:57.619
Addic spaces, pitched roofs, mechanical systems that were outside on the ground.

00:24:57.619 --> 00:25:05.619
We were designing a residential structure and trying to put commercial systems into it.

00:25:05.619 --> 00:25:15.619
So when we had the floor plan approved by the branch committee, the designers stated that it would then take us at least six months to work up the experience because of all of the complications.

00:25:15.619 --> 00:25:20.619
And we said, well, six months is far too long. We need to shorten the time period down.

00:25:20.619 --> 00:25:27.619
So we said, well, then let's start at five o'clock tomorrow morning. We're going to need to use as much time as we can.

00:25:27.619 --> 00:25:37.730
So because there was this need to get a design developed very quickly, we decided to meet early in the morning.

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:43.730
Maintenance would weigh in, construction would weigh in, design weighed in, strategic planning.

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:47.730
All these groups had an input on us, so we would mean.

00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:58.730
By the end of the day, the engineers had been able to get rid of all of the items that they felt were going to take them nearly six months to resolve and design into our existing kingdom halls.

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:02.730
So we then started to make some progress. We started to move ahead.

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:09.349
We haven't looked back. Just go, go, go now.

00:26:09.349 --> 00:26:19.349
So we've gone from in the past ten standard designs now to one standard design with three sizes.

00:26:19.349 --> 00:26:28.349
The mechanical systems, the lighting, all of the architectural components, structure, those are all the same no matter where you build this in the country.

00:26:28.349 --> 00:26:33.349
What we'll have, though, is a small version, a standard version, and a large version.

00:26:33.349 --> 00:26:41.349
By now being able to have a construction group, no matter where they're located in the US territory, to be building the same kingdom hall.

00:26:41.349 --> 00:26:46.349
That means that you can move your construction groups around to wherever the needs are.

00:26:46.349 --> 00:26:53.349
They're not having to relearn how to build a new kingdom hall. They're just continuing on in the same means and methods, building the same building that they're used to.

00:26:53.349 --> 00:26:57.349
And as all of us are aware, the more often you do something, the faster you get at it.

00:26:57.349 --> 00:27:05.349
It cuts down tremendously on those involved in estimating cuts down tremendously on the amount of people involved in purchasing.

00:27:05.349 --> 00:27:14.349
We can place thousands of line items to a supplier in one order, knowing exactly what we need to build the kingdom hall.

00:27:14.349 --> 00:27:24.349
Purchasing and global purchasing was really helpful in helping us see the wisdom and practicality of designing and selecting specific materials.

00:27:24.349 --> 00:27:33.349
Not just a manufacturer, but a certain set of specific materials or products that manufacturers provided.

00:27:33.349 --> 00:27:37.349
For example, the manufacturer was able to reduce the lead time.

00:27:37.349 --> 00:27:42.349
Cost savings of about 40% on that one component have been seen.

00:27:42.349 --> 00:27:49.349
And even when we had a problem just recently at an installation, the company flew a representative out the next day for no charge.

00:27:49.349 --> 00:27:54.349
That wouldn't have been possible without the standardization and collaboration that's taken place.

00:27:54.349 --> 00:28:09.779
So we're seeing this evidence of these huge reductions in price. That's a simple result. And a beautiful one at that.

00:28:09.779 --> 00:28:18.779
By this point in the program, those in attendance were eager to learn how the new arrangement for kingdom halls would be put into effect throughout the branch territory.

00:28:18.779 --> 00:28:30.779
Brother Jonathan Robbins, the overseer of the United States local design construction department, spoke on the subject new provisions to accelerate the work.

00:28:30.779 --> 00:28:34.779
Maybe I can invite you to turn to that account in the book of First Chronicles.

00:28:34.779 --> 00:28:43.779
Let's just pick up a few thoughts in chapter 28. First Chronicles, chapter 28, verse 12.

00:28:43.779 --> 00:28:52.779
You notice how it begins there speaking of David. It says he gave him Solomon, the architectural plan.

00:28:52.779 --> 00:28:58.779
So the plans would be established at the department. But what follows after that?

00:28:58.779 --> 00:29:03.779
Well, put your eyes up to verse 11. Do you notice there more detail?

00:29:03.779 --> 00:29:09.779
There was the plan of the porch, the houses, the storerooms, the roof chambers, the inner rooms.

00:29:09.779 --> 00:29:14.779
So now here we have the whole scope of work. So you've got the plan, you've got the scope of work.

00:29:14.779 --> 00:29:20.779
Now when you've got the scope of work, you need the material takeoff. Cast your eyes to verse 15.

00:29:20.779 --> 00:29:27.779
Also the weight for the gold lamp stands, verse 16. Also the weight of the gold for the tables.

00:29:27.779 --> 00:29:34.779
At the end of verse 17, the weight of the small silver bowls for each small bowl.

00:29:35.779 --> 00:29:42.779
So now we've got the estimate, the material takeoff and an estimate. With that you can produce a budget.

00:29:42.779 --> 00:29:49.779
And you look across to chapter 29 and you see verse 7 onwards. There they have now how much it's going to cost.

00:29:49.779 --> 00:29:57.779
Now that's really what the LDC department is involved in is working out those kind of details.

00:29:57.779 --> 00:30:06.779
So back to chapter 28, the end of verse 19, it says to put all the details of the architectural plan in writing.

00:30:06.779 --> 00:30:15.779
So everything documented. And those full set of documented plans have been worked on the budgets, the cost estimates, the material takeoff.

00:30:15.779 --> 00:30:19.779
These are part of the responsibilities of the department.

00:30:19.779 --> 00:30:28.779
But something that might be coming to your mind is how can the branch committee who are situated here understand the real needs in the field.

00:30:28.779 --> 00:30:36.779
They have to make decisions of where kingdom halls will be situated, the size of those kingdom halls, who will meet in them.

00:30:36.779 --> 00:30:48.779
And we've discussed, well there's a master plan. And that master plan enables the branch committee to identify high need areas, identify kingdom halls that are in need of major innovation.

00:30:48.779 --> 00:30:58.779
Because we carried out a countrywide survey of over 6,000 kingdom halls. They were inspected to work out what is the life expectancy before they need to be renovated.

00:30:58.779 --> 00:31:05.779
But all of that information really is just clinical information. It's just clinical data that is taken in.

00:31:05.779 --> 00:31:12.779
So how does the branch committee now make a decision? They need to understand the human side.

00:31:12.779 --> 00:31:16.779
How does this affect the local brothers and sisters?

00:31:16.779 --> 00:31:26.779
So another new provision is a role of special full-time service that refers to the local design construction representative.

00:31:26.779 --> 00:31:37.779
Special full-time servants that are in the field, a brother, if married accompanied by his wife, that really are information gatherers, researchers.

00:31:37.779 --> 00:31:47.779
And so he would meet with the local service committees of the various affected congregations to find out, well what are their needs?

00:31:47.779 --> 00:31:54.779
What is the human side that will now be information that can be sent into the branch committee?

00:31:54.779 --> 00:32:01.779
They can take the clinical data and the physical needs. And I make a decision that will address that in the finest way.

00:32:01.779 --> 00:32:07.779
Let's look in on our next video that takes us into the work and life of a field representative.

00:32:07.779 --> 00:32:26.650
What a field representative does, they provide a service to the congregation.

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:30.650
It could be that a new kingdom all needs to be built, a kingdom all needs to be remodeled.

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:38.650
Or it may be that the recommendation is that through moving congregations around or redistributing those congregations according to the

00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:46.650
kingdom halls in the area, there perhaps no kingdom halls need to be built. So they're looking at what is the best recommendation to solve a specific problem.

00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:54.650
A field representative's work begins when a need is identified, a need by a congregation or congregations meeting in a kingdom hall.

00:32:54.650 --> 00:33:04.650
And really they would start by meeting with bodies of elders, trying to understand what really is needed, how best to address that need.

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:28.650
Initially in his first meetings with the bodies of elders, he would give an overview of what is the local design construction department, what does it do, what does the remote local design construction office do, how does he fit into that, how can they as a body of elders become part of it, how can they support the project, how can they encourage ones within their congregation to volunteer.

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:52.650
While you can get some clinical data at the branch level, you still need the human element. So the field representative meets with bodies of elders to determine certain information such as high crime areas, areas of racial bias, and any other information that they can get from those local bodies of elders to help make a recommendation that truly cares for everyone's interests.

00:33:52.650 --> 00:34:00.650
The elders can count on the field representatives wanting to hear those opinions and relying on those opinions in developing the recommendations.

00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:07.650
Field representatives are very much about gathering information. It's data so that good decisions can be made.

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:14.650
The field rep is going to go in and assess not just that kingdom hall, but all of the surrounding ones.

00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:25.650
What is the need of that area, how are all the kingdom halls utilized, is there good growth in the area, or is there a percentage decrease?

00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:30.650
Are there those that need to use public transportation, but where are the public transportation routes?

00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:39.650
In this congregation are there people from an ethnic background that would feel uncomfortable moving into another part of the town because they would feel possibly vulnerable there or not wanted.

00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:47.650
What is the age of the congregation? Is it a young, vibrant congregation, or does it have a lot of elderly, a lot of infirm?

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:55.650
If it's in a congested area, where are the rush hour traffic routes so that the friends are not traveling in the rush hour traffic to get to the kingdom hall?

00:34:55.650 --> 00:35:00.650
So all that information is collected so that again the best recommendation can be made.

00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:15.650
And their work would continue all the way until that needs filled. So if you took, for example, a new kingdom hall being needed, then they would be working with land acquisition, with permitting, with regulatory.

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:21.650
All the way up until there was a parcel of land ready to be built on.

00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:46.579
Field representatives are a bit nomadic. They will move around the country, they will have to be mobile, almost carrying their office with them, and visiting with many bodies of elders, and trying to determine how do we truly assess and supply the information needed to make good decisions.

00:35:46.579 --> 00:35:59.579
They all live modestly. I mean, some, depending on where they're serving, may live in some sort of special full-time servant housing. Others may be staying with friends, brothers and sisters locally.

00:35:59.579 --> 00:36:04.579
In some places, the only option may be to rent a small apartment or something.

00:36:04.579 --> 00:36:20.579
And you have similar spiritual benefits to Bethelite. We get to have morning worship streamed. We get watched tower family study. We're well taken care of, it's well taken care of spiritually.

00:36:20.579 --> 00:36:35.579
And of course, like every other one of Jehovah's Witnesses, we get to be associated with the congregation and go out in the ministry and maintain our spiritual routine like everybody else.

00:36:35.579 --> 00:36:48.579
We get up in the morning, we have breakfast, we have morning worship, and then we're either driving around looking for property or maybe scheduling meetings with brothers for congregations.

00:36:48.579 --> 00:36:55.579
Part of the job of the field representative is to work regularly with the municipalities in the area in which they're assigned.

00:36:55.579 --> 00:37:05.579
So they will be working with those individuals because they'll have many projects that they're working on, that they're developing, and that development will include the input of those municipalities.

00:37:05.579 --> 00:37:09.579
So they'll also be working to establish relationships with those individuals.

00:37:09.579 --> 00:37:25.900
It's fast paced, but it's an exciting work because you get to see a lot of things where Satan has built barriers to Jehovah's work being done.

00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:31.900
And to see those barriers come down or be broken through is faith strengthening privilege.

00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:39.900
I feel so grateful that the branch is so interested in all of us, brothers and sisters.

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:49.900
The most important thing that a field representative will have is their commitment to the work and their faith that this program is going to be successful.

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:57.900
This is going to be Jehovah's work done, Jehovah's way, and it will be on his might and by his Holy Spirit that we will be successful.

00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:13.210
When you look at something like that, you may say that this LDC representative and his wife, they must be multi-talented property development professionals.

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:14.210
No, they're not.

00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:20.210
These are spiritually minded individuals that rely upon Jehovah, rely upon his direction.

00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:27.210
We know that Jehovah with his four vision can already see where these kingdom halls will be, and so they follow his direction.

00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:37.210
At the same time, yes, reaching out to professionals for advice, for mentoring, for guidance, but having a very positive outlook.

00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:43.210
We often refer to them as individuals that when someone says no to them, they understand that to be maybe.

00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:45.210
They don't take the word as no.

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:54.210
So it's that kind of individual sees an obstacle, not as an obstacle, but something to get around, get over, and move forward with Jehovah's direction.

00:38:54.210 --> 00:39:03.210
So we found the land, we've got it in the right place, we've got the permits for it, but how do we go about building it?

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:11.210
Well, handle construction, another new provision for our branch territory is construction groups.

00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:24.210
But these are construction groups of eight persons made up of full-time servants, whether construction servants or volunteers, that work full-time for building the kingdom halls.

00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:32.210
Assisted, cared for financially and physically, in a very similar manner as a Bethelite would be cared for.

00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:42.210
The construction group is responsible for that project from breaking ground through the congregation taking occupancy of the kingdom hall.

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:44.210
That really is their responsibility.

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:53.210
The group overseer would be responsible for proving the budget and managing that budget, right, the way through to the conclusion.

00:39:53.210 --> 00:40:02.210
You may say, can eight persons build a kingdom hall? Well, I suppose the simple answer is yes, but it's going to take them a very long time to do that.

00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:07.210
So they need assistance, they need volunteers that can work along with them.

00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:16.210
And so this is where they will reach out to local skilled volunteers who will be invited to come and work along with them.

00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:25.210
But these eight individuals are not in a role where they just do administrative work. They will be physically working on the project.

00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:39.210
These LDC volunteers that will be invited, they will need to have specific skills, tradesmen that would come to the site to work along with the group, remembering that the construction group is working full-time.

00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:43.210
They are scheduled. They work from a Tuesday through to a Saturday.

00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:50.210
And so individuals that would support them, they would be looking for brothers that could make themselves available during the week.

00:40:50.210 --> 00:40:57.210
If their skill is needed and their trade is needed at a certain time, that job can't be left until the weekend.

00:40:57.210 --> 00:41:05.210
We need to be done during the week. Equally, they will use the options of having contractors come to site.

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:11.210
Certain parts of the project may be contracted out. Maybe the site works. But they still take responsibility.

00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:16.210
They take responsibility for the timing, the scheduling, the quality control.

00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:24.210
So there will be a combination of usage so that these eight servants are supported to accomplish their task.

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:31.210
The size and scope of the work ahead is significant, not only in the United States but around the world.

00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:36.210
Some have wondered how these construction servants and volunteers will be supported.

00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:43.210
Good question. The next report provides the answer and addresses the question, how can I help?

00:41:43.210 --> 00:42:04.559
We need to construct, remodel and maintain thousands of kingdom halls and other theocratic facilities all over the United States branch territory.

00:42:05.559 --> 00:42:10.559
Who will spare head this work? Construction, servants and volunteers.

00:42:10.559 --> 00:42:22.559
By other special full-time servants, these brothers and sisters willingly leave behind their friends, jobs, homes, congregations,

00:42:22.559 --> 00:42:31.559
and sometimes even personal treasures to serve Jehovah more fully wherever they are needed. And they will be busy.

00:42:31.559 --> 00:42:38.559
They'll have morning worship each day and a family watched our study each week.

00:42:38.559 --> 00:42:51.380
Additionally, their daily work assignments, congregation privileges, and field ministry will also keep them active.

00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:59.380
And they'll need to make time for some recreation as well. And perhaps even make time for sleep.

00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:08.980
Their assignment likely sounds similar to an assignment at Bethel, but the comparisons don't stop there.

00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:23.980
Just like Bethelites, construction, servants and volunteers will need provisions for rooming, meals, housekeeping, laundry dry cleaning, medical care, haircuts, and much more.

00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:30.980
Of course, it's challenging to care for the needs of the Bethel family when they're all in one place.

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:37.980
But imagine providing similar services for volunteers and hundreds of locations all at once.

00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:41.980
What a challenge. How will this be handled?

00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:54.980
The local design construction department at Bethel in cooperation with the eight remote LDC offices will coordinate the work assignments and spiritual care for each volunteer.

00:43:54.980 --> 00:44:08.980
However, local congregations receiving assistance will have the privilege to provide many or all of the personal services needed to support these willing volunteers.

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:17.980
With this arrangement, local congregations benefit from the hard work of these special full-time servants.

00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:27.980
All while ensuring they can remain immersed in their assignment to provide assistance to congregations wherever and however they need it.

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:34.980
A sacrifice for all involved, but one that comes with many blessings.

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:41.420
But you may be wondering, how do I apply? How can I get involved in this program?

00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:44.420
And so we want to take you through the different enrollments.

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:48.420
And we'd like to look at the first graphic that takes us into this.

00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:52.420
And this is our construction volunteer.

00:44:52.420 --> 00:45:00.420
The construction volunteer, as you can see here on your screen, the form is in the bottom right-hand corner. That is an 827.

00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:11.420
And someone can be assigned for one week up to maybe six months as a volunteer and also receive physical and financial care in their assignment.

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:21.420
Spiritual men and women in good health, capable of doing hard physical work between the ages of 19 and 55 can apply.

00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:30.420
Those with special skills over the age of 55, the branch committee may give special consideration if their skills are required.

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:34.420
The next enrollment is that of a construction servant.

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:38.420
You may notice there the application form is an A32.

00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:45.420
You cannot apply to be a construction servant. You are invited after serving as a construction volunteer for two months.

00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:50.420
You may receive an invitation to be a servant on a long-term basis.

00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:56.420
The final approval for this appointment is from the personal committee of the governing body.

00:45:56.420 --> 00:46:00.420
And this enrollment is a special full-time service.

00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:04.420
The next enrollment is the local construction servant.

00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:08.420
We'd like to look at the difference there with a local construction servant.

00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:13.420
They're someone that can live in their own home, same application form.

00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:19.420
They will have served as a volunteer and then can be appointed as a servant.

00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:22.420
They're appointed for the duration of a project.

00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:26.420
They could possibly live in their own home and work at one of the remote offices.

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:31.420
They could live in their own home and work on a few projects that are in their area.

00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:36.420
But when those projects are over, their assignment then ends.

00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:40.420
A new enrollment is the LDC volunteer.

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:48.420
The application form, the DC50, was uploaded to JW.org on Wednesday evening of this week.

00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:52.420
And with it, there's an accompanying letter to be read to all congregations,

00:46:52.420 --> 00:47:00.420
where it explains the fundamental differences between the construction volunteer and the LDC volunteer,

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:03.420
or the DC50 application.

00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:08.420
This application replaces the Regional Building Committee volunteer application.

00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:11.420
One we're familiar with is the S82 form.

00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:17.420
On this application, you'll notice that it uses the expression that this is for an exemplary baptised

00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:23.420
brother or sister with a some measure of needed skills or aptitude.

00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:27.420
The applicant must be at least 17 years of age.

00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:34.420
Exemplary, one who demonstrates an example worthy of imitation in such areas as meeting attendants,

00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:39.420
zeal in the ministry, in respect and support of the body of elders.

00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:44.420
They would then apply by means of the DC50 application.

00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:49.420
A fifth enrollment is the congregation volunteer.

00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:53.420
There's no application form for this enrollment.

00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:59.420
This is for someone over the age of 17 that is in good standing within the congregation.

00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:06.420
And they would work on their own congregation project or on one that is neighbouring their congregation.

00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:10.420
And they would be approved by the service committee of their own congregation

00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:13.420
and would be invited then to come to a project.

00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:21.420
In good standing, one who is not under judicial restrictions or not bringing reproach upon the congregation.

00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:26.420
So what a privilege we have to support this new arrangement.

00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:31.420
And it certainly is exciting to see all of these forms of special full-time service

00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:35.420
that are being extended within our branch territory.

00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:39.420
And we can see two of many practical ways that we can support the arrangement.

00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:46.420
Practical ways with regard to supporting it financially by means of our generous contributions.

00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:53.420
Taking our minds back to the construction of the Temple by Solomon in the First Chronicles 29, verse 9.

00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:58.420
It says that the people rejoiced over making these voluntary offerings.

00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:01.420
So Jehovah knows what makes us truly happy.

00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:06.420
He knows that giving of ourselves in service of him brings us great joy.

00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:14.420
And certainly the LDC program offers us all numerous ways to demonstrate our love for our Heavenly Father.

00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:21.420
Just as construction of our kingdom halls is important, so is the maintenance of these facilities.

00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:27.420
Brother Jason Patterson, the assistant overseer of the United States Local Design Construction Department,

00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:33.420
addressed this subject with this theme, maintaining the House of Jehovah.

00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:40.420
This part highlighted new initiatives that will help us care for our theocratic facilities.

00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:48.420
Brothers, I invite you to turn with me to Psalm chapter 66, beginning with verse 2.

00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:53.420
Notice the description of worshiping Jehovah that's found here. Psalm 66, verse 2.

00:49:53.420 --> 00:50:02.199
Sing praises to his glorious name. Make his praise glorious.

00:50:02.199 --> 00:50:05.199
And then please notice verse 8.

00:50:05.199 --> 00:50:11.199
Praise our God, you peoples, and let the sound of his praise be heard.

00:50:11.199 --> 00:50:16.639
These are elements that take place within the walls of our kingdom halls.

00:50:16.639 --> 00:50:22.639
It's the singing, the teaching, the learning, and certainly the praising of Jehovah God

00:50:22.639 --> 00:50:27.639
that makes our kingdom halls the most important structure in the community.

00:50:27.639 --> 00:50:34.639
There's a connection between our zeal for worship and our zeal for caring for our places of worship.

00:50:34.639 --> 00:50:40.639
When I was asked to present this part on maintenance, I began to think about what is the objective of this part.

00:50:40.639 --> 00:50:47.639
I thought, well, we could highlight the fact that maintaining our kingdom halls is a part of our sacred service.

00:50:47.639 --> 00:50:53.639
And that's certainly accurate. Or perhaps we could focus on how it is the elders' responsibilities

00:50:53.639 --> 00:51:00.639
and make sure that this work is cared for. And that would be a nice reminder for us.

00:51:00.639 --> 00:51:04.639
But the primary objective of this part is this.

00:51:04.639 --> 00:51:12.639
You brothers are extremely busy men, and you have many responsibilities that have been given to you.

00:51:12.639 --> 00:51:21.639
How does this new program come to your assistance to help you in caring for the assignment to maintain the house of Jehovah?

00:51:21.639 --> 00:51:28.050
Perhaps you've heard the expression that you cannot manage what you can't measure.

00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:35.050
How do you truly measure what needs to be done and when it needs to be done at each of our kingdom halls?

00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:41.050
Consider this illustration. When we buy a car, typically in the glove box of the car is an owner's manual.

00:51:41.050 --> 00:51:49.050
At the back of the owner's manual is often a checklist of preventative or predictive maintenance items.

00:51:49.050 --> 00:51:57.050
If an individual were to follow that list of items at the back of that, that would help to extend the life of the vehicle.

00:51:57.050 --> 00:52:05.389
Which would certainly be far better than not knowing what needs to be done and then simply fixing it when it breaks.

00:52:05.389 --> 00:52:17.389
Under this new arrangement, the maintenance of our theocratic facilities will now be following a unified process that is being implemented worldwide.

00:52:17.389 --> 00:52:26.389
This includes facilities such as kingdom halls, assembly halls, remote translation offices, and other buildings.

00:52:26.389 --> 00:52:33.389
We want to consider some aspects of this new process, though, especially as it relates to kingdom halls.

00:52:33.389 --> 00:52:47.389
Although you may have an owner's manual in your car or the checklist in it, the car manufacturer does not send out a mechanic to help you understand how to go about maintaining your vehicle.

00:52:47.389 --> 00:52:52.389
But under the new maintenance program, a gradual change will be taking place.

00:52:52.389 --> 00:53:05.389
And that is this. Full-time servants known as maintenance trainers will visit and provide hands-on training to the elders and to the publishers in the congregation on what needs to be maintained and how to maintain it.

00:53:05.389 --> 00:53:13.389
So in essence, it's like getting an owner's manual for your kingdom hall with someone who helps you to understand how to go about doing it.

00:53:13.389 --> 00:53:21.389
A yearly schedule of items needing maintain will be created for each kingdom all for the elders to be able to manage and measure the workload.

00:53:21.389 --> 00:53:30.389
Of course, the goal of all of this, then, is to extend the life of our buildings to conserve dedicated funds.

00:53:30.389 --> 00:53:42.389
If it's found that a particular maintenance task is beyond the congregation's ability to care for it, the elders will be able to work with the remote office for their zone to be able to determine how best to take care of that matter.

00:53:42.389 --> 00:53:54.389
Now, in addition, the training that will be received at the congregation level will include a focus on how performing our work in a safe manner will be expected.

00:53:54.389 --> 00:54:01.389
And, in fact, the elders will see their role in setting a consistent standard and an expectation of safety.

00:54:01.389 --> 00:54:07.389
It's a better understand some of the benefits and the details of what we're talking about.

00:54:07.389 --> 00:54:12.389
We'd like to invite you brothers to enjoy the following video.

00:54:12.389 --> 00:54:30.940
I think one of the biggest challenges is that is our attitude towards maintenance.

00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:37.940
Usually, maintenance is something other people do, but we don't do it ourselves.

00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:45.940
Maintenance generally is something that people shy away from. People love to build something new. They feel it's more challenging, more exciting.

00:54:45.940 --> 00:54:50.940
Maintenance is viewed as a little bit secondary, second rate.

00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:58.940
Not a scriptural thinking. We think that Jehovah created us to maintain. He put Adam in the garden to take care of it.

00:54:58.940 --> 00:55:04.940
So, Jehovah created us genetically to take care of things. He takes care of everything.

00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:13.940
So, we have often to overcome that mindset that many of us have inherited probably growing up in Satan's world.

00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:21.940
Everything is throw away. It's all disposable. And so, we tend to get that kind of thinking, that kind of way of reacting.

00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:29.940
So, that comes through to assembly halls, kingdom halls, that it's a challenge often to motivate the brothers to maintain.

00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:43.170
Well, the LDC is trying to help with the workload by providing a nice way of scheduling the maintenance tasks that need to be done in focusing on preventative maintenance.

00:55:43.170 --> 00:55:50.170
Throughout the year, rather than letting everything pile up all at once, there's so much that needs to get done.

00:55:50.170 --> 00:55:57.170
But under this new program, we have a yearly schedule now that helps to get all these things done in organized way.

00:55:57.170 --> 00:56:04.170
Well, the schedule allows these tasks to be delegated to the different brothers and sisters that are in the congregation.

00:56:04.170 --> 00:56:12.170
And so, if they can just visibly see what needs to be done and start taking them upon themselves to take care of those items, they've been assigned them.

00:56:12.170 --> 00:56:21.170
Well, now you've spread that workload out. Instead of having it fall on just a handful of brothers in the congregation who can easily get overworked.

00:56:21.170 --> 00:56:25.170
With just a little bit of time on the weekend, you'd be surprised what can get accomplished.

00:56:25.170 --> 00:56:38.059
Well, we have maintenance trainers that will come around, and every kingdom hall in the United States will be visited.

00:56:38.059 --> 00:56:49.059
The elders will be invited along with specialty brothers, and then those brothers will be trained on, you know, the schedule, the job cards, what to look for.

00:56:49.059 --> 00:56:59.059
And then in turn, they will train rest of the publishers in their congregations on how they can assist with maintaining their house of worship.

00:56:59.059 --> 00:57:07.059
Our role as kingdom hall maintenance trainers is to isolate individuals within an area and train them how to train the congregation.

00:57:07.059 --> 00:57:16.059
They're going to find locally tradesmen who have experience as electricians, as plumbers, with heat and air.

00:57:16.059 --> 00:57:30.059
And those brothers are going to come in and they're going to bring in the congregation, the friends from within the congregation, and they're going to train them how to be able to learn to service an electrical panel, how to change a filter on a heat and air unit.

00:57:31.059 --> 00:57:38.059
Training done at the local congregation level includes such things as mechanical, electrical, plumbing systems.

00:57:38.059 --> 00:57:44.059
There can be some of the carpentry issues that may come up, the parking lot, the landscaping.

00:57:44.059 --> 00:57:50.059
It's really, and how does the building function? And what is necessary to keep that building in good working order?

00:57:50.059 --> 00:57:55.059
The maintenance program is not a team of brothers that come around to maintain the assembly hall.

00:57:55.059 --> 00:57:58.059
It's not a team of brothers that are coming to maintain the kingdom hall.

00:57:58.059 --> 00:58:06.059
They're coming to train the local congregation, to train those volunteers at the assembly hall how to maintain it themselves.

00:58:06.059 --> 00:58:09.059
So it is an entire training program.

00:58:09.059 --> 00:58:19.059
So you have qualified tradesmen that give hands on training, one-on-one, on how to carry out all of the maintenance functions, for instance, in a kingdom hall.

00:58:19.059 --> 00:58:30.670
And we don't just do it once, it's now ongoing. We keep coming back and back and back constantly training the brothers and sisters.

00:58:30.670 --> 00:58:42.670
It's not just a select group. Everybody that has a circumstance is able to come and learn and use that training to keep Jehovah's House looking good.

00:58:42.670 --> 00:58:49.670
And when it looks good, we know that we're happy, but it really brings praise and glory to Jehovah.

00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:59.670
We're finding that this program is actually helping many of our young people because it is sort of trying to close the gap between many of our young people.

00:58:59.670 --> 00:59:06.670
That for whatever reasons don't aren't interested in construction or maintenance of buildings.

00:59:06.670 --> 00:59:14.670
So this sort of opens their eyes to some of the many aspects that there are in maintenance.

00:59:14.670 --> 00:59:21.670
With our older friends, we realize that they have the most experience of anyone when it comes to maintenance.

00:59:21.670 --> 00:59:31.670
Over their experience, their years and other projects, they've learned that if you ignore one thing, it just gets compounded and becomes worse.

00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:40.670
While we saw sisters being trained, for example, on working doors, and before it used to just be hardware that people would see this little metal box on the top of the door,

00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:45.670
and now we know that the door closure, that's hardware for that, and sisters know how to adjust it.

00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:51.670
And sisters know how to, how it eases closure, why it's important.

00:59:51.670 --> 00:59:55.670
They will never look at a door the same way, and that's what we want to happen at Kingdom Halls.

00:59:55.670 --> 01:00:04.670
We want people to be trained to such a point that immediately if something is starting to break or something is starting to fall apart,

01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:08.670
anybody will notice it and say, hey, you know what, that needs to be fixed, and I know how to do that.

01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:15.670
There are going to be tens of thousands of RBC volunteers that are going to wonder where, where do they fit into this new program.

01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:22.670
And there's a tremendous need for those brothers and sisters that are willing and able to care for existing Kingdom Halls.

01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:24.670
Their own Kingdom Hall is an example.

01:00:24.670 --> 01:00:26.670
Everybody gets to get involved.

01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:35.670
Whether you're small, whether you're young or older, there are tasks that are not physically demanding and not time intensive.

01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:46.909
So there's going to be a portion of the maintenance for everybody in the congregation.

01:00:46.909 --> 01:00:56.909
We need to keep training people, and for those who may not be working on Kingdom Halls as directly,

01:00:56.909 --> 01:01:00.909
before they throw in the towel, think about your local Kingdom Hall.

01:01:00.909 --> 01:01:06.909
I think this program, what I've seen from it, is similar to when we learn a new biblical truth,

01:01:06.909 --> 01:01:11.909
and sometimes we're like, oh, I didn't see this coming, or I didn't expect this,

01:01:11.909 --> 01:01:15.909
and then we analyze the information and it clicks, and you say, of course, it makes so much sense.

01:01:15.909 --> 01:01:19.909
And this program is similar, because it may be a little foreign at first,

01:01:19.909 --> 01:01:24.909
but as soon as you're involved in it, that's your reaction, of course, it makes complete sense.

01:01:24.909 --> 01:01:29.909
And so the attitudes are going to change, of course, we're going to be more united,

01:01:29.909 --> 01:01:34.909
because everyone's going to be taking care of their places of worship exactly the same way,

01:01:34.909 --> 01:01:39.909
and that's going to only bring about more blessings and more growth.

01:01:39.909 --> 01:01:43.909
In actual fact, the greatest investment in this organization is caring for what we already have,

01:01:43.909 --> 01:01:45.909
not for what we need.

01:01:45.909 --> 01:01:48.909
We have more than 60,000 Kingdom Halls worldwide.

01:01:48.909 --> 01:01:55.909
If we can extend the maintenance cycle of our Kingdom Halls worldwide just by one year,

01:01:56.909 --> 01:02:05.909
we save the organization $80 million a year just by pushing on a renovation cycle by one year.

01:02:05.909 --> 01:02:11.909
So there, if our brothers and sisters can become involved in the maintenance of their Kingdom Hall

01:02:11.909 --> 01:02:16.909
and surrounding Kingdom Halls, that we are a phenomenal blessing to the organization

01:02:16.909 --> 01:02:20.909
and a huge economic saving.

01:02:20.909 --> 01:02:23.909
When things are clean, you're drawn to it.

01:02:23.909 --> 01:02:27.909
If your car is clean, or if somebody else's car is clean, you're drawn to it.

01:02:27.909 --> 01:02:31.909
And I think with the Kingdom Halls, it's the same way.

01:02:31.909 --> 01:02:36.909
If somebody drives by and the grass is moat, it looks good, it's all trimmed up,

01:02:36.909 --> 01:02:41.909
it's all pated nice, you're just drawn to that.

01:02:41.909 --> 01:02:48.909
And people in the world just don't care sometimes, but we as Jehovah people, we care.

01:02:48.909 --> 01:02:55.909
So as we maintain our Kingdom Halls, all it takes is one person to drive by and say,

01:02:55.909 --> 01:02:58.909
I want to see what makes them different.

01:02:58.909 --> 01:03:02.909
And that cleanliness might be just a thing that draws them in.

01:03:02.909 --> 01:03:12.710
So some of you, you may not work directly with building or renovating Kingdom Halls.

01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:15.710
Some of you may never be filled representatives.

01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:19.989
Some of you may not serve on a construction group.

01:03:19.989 --> 01:03:26.989
But brothers, it's going to take the efforts of all of us to be able to live up to the words of Nehemiah chapter 10 verse 39,

01:03:26.989 --> 01:03:28.989
where it says,

01:03:28.989 --> 01:03:32.989
we will not neglect the house of our God.

01:03:32.989 --> 01:03:35.989
So Jehovah's name is proudly displayed on our Kingdom Halls.

01:03:35.989 --> 01:03:40.989
When we invite others to attend our meetings, how gratifying to be able to do so with confidence

01:03:40.989 --> 01:03:46.989
that what they observe there properly represents Jehovah and his organization.

01:03:46.989 --> 01:03:49.989
The earth will last forever.

01:03:49.989 --> 01:03:52.989
Mankind was assigned to take care of it.

01:03:52.989 --> 01:03:59.989
Therefore, maintenance is an assignment that will be carried out forever by all true worshipers.

01:03:59.989 --> 01:04:04.989
So how delighted Jehovah must be when he sees us demonstrate that attitude now

01:04:04.989 --> 01:04:07.989
by maintaining his house with seal.

01:04:07.989 --> 01:04:16.530
Brother Stephen led a member of the governing body, presented the final part of our program for the day.

01:04:16.530 --> 01:04:24.530
We invite you to enjoy his discussion of the theme, a united workforce of theocratic activity.

01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:36.219
I would just like to say first that it is a real pleasure to be able to talk for a few minutes to all of you dear ones

01:04:36.219 --> 01:04:41.219
who obviously loved Jehovah very much.

01:04:41.219 --> 01:04:44.219
And you're not just saying that you love him.

01:04:44.219 --> 01:04:48.219
You are proving it by your hard work.

01:04:48.219 --> 01:04:56.219
Speaking in behalf of the governing body, I would like to tell all of you that we love you very much

01:04:56.219 --> 01:05:01.219
and we appreciate very much what you are doing.

01:05:01.219 --> 01:05:13.219
But now as mentioned, the theme of my little discussion is a united workforce for theocratic activity.

01:05:13.219 --> 01:05:23.219
Much of our program today has highlighted the fulfillment of the words recorded in Isaiah chapter 60, verse 22,

01:05:23.219 --> 01:05:30.219
concerning the small one becoming a mighty nation.

01:05:30.219 --> 01:05:33.219
Let us reread this timely scripture.

01:05:33.219 --> 01:05:37.219
Isaiah 60, verse 22,

01:05:37.219 --> 01:05:47.219
the little one will become a thousand and the small one a mighty nation.

01:05:47.219 --> 01:05:54.219
I myself Jehovah will speed it up in its own time.

01:05:54.219 --> 01:06:06.219
Did you know at present this nation of true worshipers is more populous than a considerable number of the world's sovereign states?

01:06:06.219 --> 01:06:18.219
And as a result of Jehovah's powerful Holy Spirit, it is a mighty nation, more mighty than any of the world's sovereign states.

01:06:18.219 --> 01:06:28.219
So think about it. We're more populous than many were mightier than all the sovereign states of this world.

01:06:28.219 --> 01:06:40.219
Clearly, Jehovah God using his son Jesus Christ is directing the kingdom work and is speeding it up.

01:06:40.219 --> 01:06:47.219
Recall in the scripture, we just read that Jehovah said, I myself will speed it up in its own time.

01:06:47.219 --> 01:06:54.219
He didn't say that the governing body would speed it up. It is Jehovah's work.

01:06:54.219 --> 01:07:02.219
The faithful slave is merely a tool in his hand to accomplish his work.

01:07:02.219 --> 01:07:13.599
The peace and unity existing among God's people, as you know, continues to attract millions of honest-hearted ones.

01:07:13.599 --> 01:07:22.599
What a thrill it is to be alive during the worldwide expansion of true worship and to have a part in it.

01:07:22.599 --> 01:07:28.599
It is a privilege we will cherish for all eternity.

01:07:28.599 --> 01:07:36.599
This increase brings glory to Jehovah, who promised that this increase would come.

01:07:36.599 --> 01:07:42.599
Let us consider three effects of this rapid expansion.

01:07:42.599 --> 01:07:48.599
The first effect, because of the formation of new congregations every week,

01:07:48.599 --> 01:07:59.599
Jehovah's people need to continue to maintain existing kingdom halls and need to build thousands of new ones.

01:08:00.599 --> 01:08:05.599
As you know, many kingdom halls are being used beyond their capacity.

01:08:05.599 --> 01:08:10.599
We have four even five congregations and some single kingdom halls.

01:08:10.599 --> 01:08:19.600
And you can just imagine what happens when the circuit owes your visits or when a maintenance project needs to be carried out.

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:35.600
Therefore, in order for the growing demand to be met, the governing body has approved an arrangement for the accelerated design, construction, and maintenance of kingdom halls.

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:44.600
Today, you received an exciting glimpse into how this program will function in your branch territory.

01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:57.600
The arrangement will bring greater unity to the organization's approach to construction not only here in the United States, but also all around the world.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:06.600
As a mighty nation of dedicated servants, Jehovah's people are truly building without borders.

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:23.600
And in that beautiful thought, building without borders, when you think about the contrast in the world, how segmented, how fragmented they are with our borders and other divisions, we are building without borders.

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:32.600
The message found in Ephesians chapter 4 verses 4 through 6 reminds us of the reason for this unity.

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:44.600
There it speaks of one spirit, one Lord, one faith, one God and Father of all who is overall.

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:58.600
Does it not make sense that worshipers of the God and Father who is overall would have a united means of caring for and building physical buildings needed to facilitate pure worship?

01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:00.600
What only makes sense, doesn't it?

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:03.600
But now let's get our second effect.

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:14.600
The Regional Building Committee, RBC arrangement, has produced thousands of beautiful houses of worship.

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:23.600
But as kingdom halls were being built throughout the United States branch territory, the number of publishers increased even further.

01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:29.600
That growth required yet more kingdom halls as that pattern continued.

01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:39.600
The efforts of those who worked under the RBC arrangement have contributed greatly as the little one has become a thousand.

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:46.600
And we'd all take for granted, we really appreciate what has been done under the RBC arrangement.

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:51.600
But why then, is there a need for a new program?

01:10:51.600 --> 01:11:06.600
Well, for one reason, and it's just one example, buying property and obtaining necessary government approvals are often much more complex today than in the past.

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:16.600
And that's just one example of the complexities that make it more difficult, more challenging to build kingdom halls today than previously.

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:30.600
In many areas of the United States branch territory, such complexities have made it impractical to accomplish the work with only part-time volunteers.

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:45.600
For this reason, the governing body gave direction that full-time volunteers and special full-time servants be appointed in order to keep pace with the urgent needs.

01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:52.600
We are confident of Jehovah's blessing on this new arrangement.

01:11:52.600 --> 01:12:04.600
It is so face strengthening to see you, brothers, loyally working hard and keeping in step with changing circumstances.

01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:12.600
You are working hard to keep pace with Jehovah's fast-moving chariot, and that's what the governing body is trying to do.

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:19.600
We are just trying to keep up with Jehovah's fast-paced chariot.

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:29.600
The October 15, 2014 watchtower made this comment on page 25.

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:35.600
It said, at times, organizational adjustments need to be made.

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:41.600
In recent years, a number of branch offices have been merged with others.

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:54.600
Those such changes require that the brothers and sisters serving at these branches make adjustments before long the advantages of the changes become clear to all involved.

01:12:54.600 --> 01:13:05.600
What a joy it is for such willing workers to play a part in the ongoing history of Jehovah's people.

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:16.600
Well, this new program is similarly a part of our ongoing theocratic history.

01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:19.600
Well, let's move to our third effect.

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:23.600
There's a lot of work to be accomplished.

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:34.600
As we near the end of this system of things and the number of kingdom proclaimers increases, there is an urgent need for more facilities.

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:46.600
So, the question logically arises, how can we have the greatest possible share in this work that urgently needs to be done now?

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:49.600
We'll consider five ways.

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:59.600
Number one, simplify your life and become available full-time if at all possible.

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:10.600
As recorded at first Chronicles 22-7, David said that it was his heart's desire to build a house for Jehovah's name.

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:15.600
See, in his heart, he was motivated. He wanted to build a house for Jehovah's name.

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:24.600
Although his role in that building was not what he expected, he did all he could to contribute.

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:30.600
Jehovah gave him by inspiration the architectural plan for the temple.

01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:43.600
He was able to amass many of the materials that would be used in the building and of course he motivated his son Solomon to move ahead in the building work.

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:48.600
So, he did what he could to contribute because his heart motivated him.

01:14:49.600 --> 01:15:07.600
Well, like David, make it a matter of prayer to increase your heart's desire to help build facilities to the glory of Jehovah's name as you resolve to do all that your circumstances will allow.

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:10.600
You will never regret it.

01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:26.600
If you talk to others who have simplified their lives in order to do more in sacred service, they will always tell you that it was one of the best decisions they have ever made and that they have no regrets.

01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:32.600
Or if they do express a regret interestingly, it is that they didn't do it sooner.

01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:42.100
They just wish sooner they had simplified their lives to make themselves available full time.

01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:54.100
But let's talk about a second way we can have a fuller share, support the work personally as much as you can, but also encourage others to participate in it.

01:15:54.100 --> 01:16:00.100
As you get that, encourage others to participate in this work.

01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:13.100
At 2 Samuel 1937, an older man, Barzilli, recommended the younger man, Kim Hem, to assist King David.

01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:22.100
Barzilli modestly understood that despite what his heart may have wanted to do, he had limitations.

01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:36.100
And no wonder the Bible tells us that he was 80 years old, yet he was quick to make and support the recommendation of another loyal servant of Jehovah.

01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:44.100
Indeed, Barzilli is a fine example of modesty and support for Jehovah's service.

01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:48.100
Well, let's move to a third way we can have a fuller share.

01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:52.100
Contribute Monaterally

01:16:52.100 --> 01:17:02.100
2 Corinthians 8 13 through 15 speaks of an equalizing that took place in the first century.

01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:05.100
And it was a real demonstration of Christian love.

01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:10.100
One group surplus offset another's deficiency.

01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:16.100
So that, as the Bible says, the person with much did not have too much.

01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:20.100
And the person with little did not have too little.

01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:27.100
Paul's words to the Corinthians applied on an international scale.

01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:38.100
If you think about it, he was encouraging the Christians in Corinth to help financially their needy brothers in Judea.

01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:49.100
Similarly today, with the consolidation of the loan arrangement, Jehovah's people around the world are equalized and linked more closely than ever before.

01:17:50.100 --> 01:18:06.100
The governing body is confident that the brotherhood will continue to honor Jehovah generously, with their valuable things, as encouraged at Proverbs 3 verse 9.

01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:17.100
Of course, in addition, each of us should continue to do our very best to ensure that these dedicated funds are used wisely.

01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:22.100
But now let's get our fourth way. We can have a fuller share.

01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:27.100
Continue to preach without let up.

01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:38.100
In accord with Matthew 28, 19 and 20, the preaching and teaching work is the primary commission from our king.

01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:47.100
Kingdom halls in themselves, as you know, do not save lives. Now they can help us save lives, but the kingdom hall in itself will not save lives.

01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:58.100
See, it is the carrying out of the spirit authorized work of preaching and teaching that results in the saving of lives.

01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:09.100
But if you think about the critical need for more kingdom halls gives evidence that you and Jehovah's people as a whole are taking this assignment seriously.

01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:24.100
So regardless of how busy you are in building kingdom halls, all of us must also stay focused on the preaching, teaching, and the simple making work.

01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:28.100
Well, let's move to our fifth way. We can have a fuller share.

01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:35.100
Keep these exciting adjustments that are being made in your prayers.

01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:42.100
James chapter 5 verse 16 says this, the B part.

01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:49.100
A righteous man's supplication has a powerful effect.

01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:54.100
Yes, a righteous man's supplication has a powerful effect.

01:19:54.100 --> 01:20:03.100
So pray for these adjustments that Jehovah will bless them and your prayers will have a powerful effect.

01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:17.100
So there we have five ways that we can have a fuller share in what is being accomplished by this unified workforce for theocratic activity in review.

01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:27.100
One, endeavor to simplify your life so as to become available full time if at all possible.

01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:39.100
Number two, in addition to supporting the work personally as much as we can, encourage others to participate in it.

01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:49.100
Number three, generously contribute monetarily in harmony with our circumstances.

01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:55.100
Number four, continue to preach without let up.

01:20:55.100 --> 01:21:06.100
Number five, pray for a Jehovah's continued rich blessings upon these exciting adjustments that are being implemented.

01:21:06.100 --> 01:21:17.100
All involved in the acceleration of the construction of kingdom halls are very dear to the governing body.

01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:23.100
We are confident in Jehovah's backing of his work as we said before is his work.

01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:31.100
And while there is much work to accomplish, what a grand privilege to be used by him by Jehovah.

01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:42.100
But how will we get it all done? Well, our Heavenly Father gives us confidence with the words of Isaiah 26 verse 12.

01:21:42.100 --> 01:21:49.100
I notice the confidence he gives us with this scripture. Isaiah 26, 12.

01:21:49.100 --> 01:22:03.100
O Jehovah, you will grant us peace because now notice everything we have done, you have accomplished for us.

01:22:03.100 --> 01:22:10.100
Let's repeat that. Jehovah says everything we have done, he has accomplished for us.

01:22:10.100 --> 01:22:20.100
At least Jehovah's work isn't. And as guaranteed in this scripture, he will empower us to get his work done.

01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:29.100
The governing body thanks you dearly for your continued sacrifices in behalf of kingdom interest.

01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:36.100
We continue to rely fully on Jehovah God to direct our path. And very soon, where is that path going to lead us?

01:22:36.100 --> 01:22:44.100
It's going to lead us right through the end of this wicked system and into the new world.

01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:52.100
Those who have remained busy now in the work of the Lord will continue as God's fellow workers.

01:22:52.100 --> 01:23:04.100
At that time in the new world, as a unified workforce, you will be thrilled to direct your attention to a new work assignment.

01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:13.100
What will that new work assignment be making the earth into a beautiful paradise?

01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:18.380
We greatly appreciate this practical information.

01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:27.380
Everywhere we go, our brothers and sisters are excited about the changes being made with regard to construction of theocratic facilities.

01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:39.380
It is a privilege to work shoulder to shoulder with you as we all do our small part in this magnificent work that Jehovah is accomplishing in these last days.

01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:44.380
Thank you for joining us. This is JW Broadcasting in Brooklyn, New York.
