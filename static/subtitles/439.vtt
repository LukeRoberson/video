00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.690
They watched our from which our comments is taken as in November

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:13.849
2018 and the theme of the article was are you making Jehovah's thoughts your own now?

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:20.250
That's a deep subject for imperfect us imperfect humans to make Jehovah's thoughts our own and

00:00:20.649 --> 00:00:23.850
The theme text is Romans 12, too. You might want to look at that

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:27.329
It's a powerful verse

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.410
They're a Paul wrote stop

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.250
being molded by this system of things and then on the other side of it

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.130
But be transformed

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:44.570
by making your mind over so that you may prove yourselves

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:49.289
To yourselves the good and acceptable and perfect will of God

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.810
What's he saying

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.130
Basically, he's telling us to let God's thoughts become ours

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:02.250
It's interesting because in spite of the great advancement in technology and the

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:08.450
Higher education look at the world's wisdom and what it's produced

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.650
Injustice unrest illicit sex

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.930
abuse of drugs we could go on and on and

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:18.810
The disastrous consequences that that's produced

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:27.090
First Corinthians reminds us in chapter one that a foolish thing of God is wiser than men

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:29.730
And the weak thing of God stronger than men

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:34.370
Well, that's a that's a principle and we all believe that

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:41.170
But that means that every one of us has a personal responsibility to work at

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.569
being transformed and to fight against

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.170
being molded by the world

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:53.250
Now Paul's inspired admonition is very direct

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.010
He doesn't say you may have to you know

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:00.370
Sort of look at this carefully and stop. No

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:06.209
He says to us stop it stop being molded by this system of things

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.689
Now we have to be determined to transform our minds from human thinking to Jehovah's

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:18.449
That means we have to acknowledge that the fact is that we're all influenced to some degree

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:21.409
By the spirit of the world we have to fight that

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.370
We have our own imperfect inclination

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.050
It takes determination

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.449
And what he says there as far as transformation is profound

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:36.050
It touches every fiber of our thinking of our

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:42.569
Inemost attitudes our feelings our inclinations things within us that no one else knows

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.449
So it's good for each one of us to ask ourselves from time to time

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:51.090
Are the changes that I'm making

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.409
Only skin deep what people can see

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.289
Or am I making adjustments deep within is my mind and influence

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:07.210
More by my culture than by Jehovah's thinking is my heart

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.770
More influence because I'm an American

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.889
Canadian Russian British Spanish black white whatever

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:17.370
Asian

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:24.449
Then by being one of Jehovah's witnesses now. It's easy to say I am one of Jehovah's witnesses

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.169
But it's not so easy to feel

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:33.650
The impact of that claim within the depths of our minds in our hearts

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:41.169
Now there's nothing wrong with being pleased with our culture and some of the traditions that come along with it

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.330
It's evident that Jehovah loves diversity and that's a beautiful thing in the human family

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:53.449
But that should not determine our attitude toward others and our general line of thought

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:56.889
Most importantly

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.090
It shouldn't diminish our determination

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:06.569
To reflect Jehovah's way of thinking rather than cultural or the system of things

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:15.449
So now where we have to be careful is it when we are studying and we some of us raised in the truth others not

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.930
And we all know that we have to work to read our minds of bad things. That's that's something that we do

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.810
But it doesn't stop there

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.410
If we only read our minds of bad things

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:32.569
Then Jesus in Matthew chapter 12 shows what could happen

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.170
Matthew chapter 12 verses

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:39.529
43 to 45

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.610
Notice what he says

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:47.129
When an unclean spirit comes out of a man

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:50.649
It passes through waterless places

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.689
In search of a resting place and finds none

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:04.569
Then it says I'll go back to my house from which I moved and on arriving it finds the house

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:10.810
Unoccupied that is a bad things and swept clean and adorn

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:18.329
But notice then it goes and takes along with it seven different spirits more wicked

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.370
than itself

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.370
And after getting inside

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:29.209
They dwell there and the final circumstances of that man became worse than the first

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:35.560
What's the thought? We have to keep pondering

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:38.439
thinking deeply

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.199
meditating

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:43.079
filling our minds on things of God otherwise

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:49.079
We can fall into the same snare that those of the world do even unwittingly

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:58.439
In fact, we can really fall into a a dangerous position of what is described at first Timothy

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.839
401

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:08.199
Where he calls out the world he says that it's being misled by inspired statements

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:10.839
and teachings of demons and

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:15.560
Never before have people been so completely deluge

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:22.279
With emotionally charged and misleading and distracting information you turn on the news

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.639
It's a hot with anger

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
unrest

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.240
lack of unity

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:37.079
But pondering on Jehovah's counsel safeguards us from falling victim inside

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.240
To misleading inspired utterances and teachings of demons

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:47.879
There's very interesting thought that highlights the need for meditation on God's word if you turn

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:51.959
With me or go to your pads your devices

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.920
Psalm 119

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.920
In verses 10 and 11

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:03.079
Notice it says with my whole heart

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:06.199
My whole heart I seek you

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.560
Do not let me stray from your commandments

00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:12.519
verse 11 in my heart

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.759
I treasure up you're saying so that I may not sin against you

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:24.600
Now we constantly hear reminders of the value of

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.639
really meditating on God's word

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:36.519
Remember our midweek meeting part keep feeding on Jehovah's reminders and the video with brother Jackson treasure Jehovah's reminders

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.560
Something we should consider

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:42.759
meditating on even further

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.240
one final thought

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:50.519
Look with me at a prayer that's likely all of ours at Isaiah 648

00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:55.990
Isaiah 648 says but now oh Jehovah

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:58.790
you are our potter

00:07:59.509 --> 00:08:01.350
Or our father

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:03.350
We are the clay and you

00:08:04.069 --> 00:08:06.069
are our potter

00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:08.069
We are all the work of your hand

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:12.470
That's something that's a privilege to make fine quality pottery

00:08:13.269 --> 00:08:16.870
A potter uses high grade clay. That's you

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:20.949
Because Jehovah has picked out the precious things

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:24.149
There are two things that he needs to do

00:08:25.029 --> 00:08:28.389
First the clay needs to be washed

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:32.230
To remove any foreign material or contamination

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:36.710
Then the clay must be mixed with the right amount of water

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:38.950
And worked

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:42.389
So that it will retain its shape after being molded under pressure

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:48.710
So water is used both in the cleansing of the clay and giving it the right consistency

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:52.230
Well, it's similar with God's word and us

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:55.750
Jehovah

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:57.590
Works on us

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:58.710
When we

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:00.870
Meditate and ponder on his word

00:09:01.909 --> 00:09:04.710
The Bible helps us to read ourselves of impurities

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:08.789
And transforms us into something valuable to Jehovah

00:09:08.789 --> 00:09:13.190
And what a privilege it is to be associated with the valuable things of Jehovah

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:19.830
The Bethel family worldwide is our microcosm of a beautiful brotherhood that Jehovah is shaping

00:09:20.789 --> 00:09:22.789
And may all of us be determined

00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:28.389
To ponder over the thoughts of God and to resist the influence of the world
