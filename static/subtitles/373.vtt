00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:04.030
We like for you to picture this scene.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.429
You're with thousands of your brothers and sisters at a convention.

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:12.230
You're riveted with the brother who's giving, delivering this beautiful talk.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.629
He's actually giving some instruction about the great tribulation and what we need to do now

00:00:17.629 --> 00:00:21.629
to go through that great tribulation loyally.

00:00:21.629 --> 00:00:28.030
But then a man steps up to the platform and addresses the speaker and says,

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.829
my brother is the executor of my father's will and he's cutting me out.

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:34.229
I deserve more.

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:39.229
I lay for you to step down from the platform, come over and talk some sense to my brother.

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:46.429
Well, as ridiculous as that sounds, this really did happen 2,000 years ago.

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:49.630
And as was brought up by our commenter at Luke chapter 12,

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.630
Jesus was speaking to a large crowd.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:58.829
In fact, in Luke chapter 12 and verse 1, it says that there was a crowd of so many thousands

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.030
that had gathered together that they were stepping on one another.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.230
So try to imagine the scene.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.829
All were trying to crowd, try to crowd closer to Jesus.

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:12.030
They wanted to listen what he had to say.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.629
There were some that were sitting, some were standing.

00:01:14.629 --> 00:01:16.230
They were on the ground. They were on rocks.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.430
They were trying to go under a shade tree.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.829
Maybe it was sunny.

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:22.230
Maybe the sun was in their eyes.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.629
Babies were crying.

00:01:23.629 --> 00:01:27.030
So all kinds of distractions were taking place.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.430
But yet Jesus continued focusing on his message.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:38.430
Yes, Jesus was speaking to some of those followers about important spiritual matters.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.230
Some of those spiritual matters were designed to prepare them for opposition that lay ahead

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.629
and how they can tap in to Jehovah's Holy Spirit and be successful.

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:53.829
And just then we read in Luke chapter 12 and verse 13,

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:56.030
the man has his request.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.030
He says, teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.030
What was the man thinking?

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:11.229
It had nothing to do with what Jesus was trying to talk to those that were gathered about.

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:16.030
Really, we can see that he was weighed down with a distraction,

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.830
anxieties over personal issues with his brother.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.629
Rather than focusing in on what Jesus had prepared for them

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.030
that would really prepare them for the future,

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.629
he was distracted with these mundane things.

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:34.430
And likely he really didn't hear anything that Jesus had to say.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:42.030
Not only was this man distracted, but he single-handedly distracted thousands of others.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:48.229
And no doubt those that were gathered had their own anxieties and that they were thinking about.

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:54.030
But did the distractions from this man become Jesus distractions?

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.430
No.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.030
Rather, Jesus refused to be drawn into this dispute over some material things.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.629
His response is found in our scriptural theme for today, Luke 12 and verse 14.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:12.629
And you can imagine Jesus looking out at the crowd, finding that man and saying,

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:18.430
man, who appointed me judge or arbitrator between you two?

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.830
Jesus could have ruled on it.

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:20.830
He was perfect.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:27.229
He could have stepped down away from his area that he was speaking from and addressed the man.

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:28.830
But he did not.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.229
It was not the time.

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:31.830
It was not the place.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.229
And it really wasn't Jesus place to get involved.

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:42.830
Jesus did not allow this man to break his focus, his spiritual focus and his real purpose for coming to the earth.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.430
And what is that?

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.030
John 3 and verse 17 says,

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.629
for God did not send his son into the world for him to judge the world,

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:55.030
but for the world to be saved through him.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.229
So Jesus knew that it was the time and the place to give instruction to his followers.

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:05.030
Prepare them for the future, point them towards Jehovah and the kingdom.

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:10.030
Knowing that we are imperfect and easily distracted.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.030
Jesus reminds us in verse 15 of the chapter 12,

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.230
what is needed.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.029
He said to them, not just the man, but to all those gathered.

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:27.230
Keep your eyes open and guard against every sort of greed or the footnote says covetousness.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:34.230
Because even when a man has an abundance, his life does not result from the things he possesses.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.430
So what was Jesus trying to get across?

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.430
Yes, they had anxieties.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.230
They had distractions, but they needed to keep focus.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:49.029
Their eyes need to be looking at what lay ahead and how they could serve Jehovah acceptably.

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:55.430
But he also warned against allowing anxieties to turn into distractions.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.629
Note verse 29 of chapter 12.

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:07.829
He said, stop seeking or focusing on what you will eat and what you would drink and stop being in anxious suspense.

00:05:07.829 --> 00:05:11.230
And verse 30 goes on to say that's what happens in the world.

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.029
That's what people are pursuing today.

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:16.829
But he said, stop, stop focusing, stop seeking.

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:20.230
And we think about the word anxious.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:26.230
Jesus used this quite a bit within this chapter and other discussions he had with his listeners.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.230
What does the word anxious mean?

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:35.230
The Greek verb rendered be anxious means to have the mind distracted.

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.829
The word distract.

00:05:36.829 --> 00:05:38.430
Where does that come from?

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.029
It's interesting to note that distract comes from the Latin word tractus,

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:46.230
meaning to be pulled or dragged.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.430
And this gives us the root word tracked.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:54.230
So to attract would be drawing towards something.

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.430
And to distract means to pull someone's attention away from something.

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.430
So this is what's happening every day of our lives.

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.430
We could be attracted to something or distracted from something.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.629
And really distractions come in all shapes and sizes.

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:17.029
In fact, my little illustration here will help us to appreciate that they come in various colors,

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:19.629
various shades and sizes.

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:22.029
Now what happens with distractions?

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:26.629
We know that they come in from external means and sometimes from ourselves.

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:30.230
We cause some of our anxieties and some of our distractions.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.029
But if we do not keep our focus,

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:36.230
what eventually happens to distractions?

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.629
They become our main focus.

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:41.829
We're not able to see past them.

00:06:42.829 --> 00:06:49.829
We need to continually keep our eyes open so that we can continue to serve Jehovah.

00:06:49.829 --> 00:06:54.430
Well, distractions for all of us come in various shapes and sizes.

00:06:54.430 --> 00:07:00.430
It could be our health concerns of our mate ourselves, our aging parents.

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:05.029
It could be a loss of a loved one or how we can provide for our family.

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:08.629
It could be the responsibilities that we have, the assignments.

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:14.230
It could be weighing us down or it could be our goal to have more responsibilities.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:18.629
We see other brothers that are gaining responsibilities and we would wish to have those.

00:07:18.829 --> 00:07:25.430
Well, all of these could become the center of our life and distract us from our service.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:30.430
But we want to remember that when anxieties and distractions threaten us,

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.629
there's something that we can do about it.

00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:35.629
A quote that I found that was, I thought was appropriate,

00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:40.829
said, starve your distractions, feed your focus.

00:07:40.829 --> 00:07:44.430
Well, how do we starve our distractions and feed our focus?

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:51.629
We go to something that Jesus said 2,000 years ago that has been the key to faithful servants ever since.

00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:55.829
And that is in chapter 12 and verse 31 of Luke, he says,

00:07:55.829 --> 00:08:01.230
keep seeking or focusing on the kingdom and all these other things will be added to you.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:08.029
And then in verse 34, for where your treasure is, that is where your heart will be also.

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:14.230
So as we seek the kingdom and we treasure what Jehovah has within that kingdom,

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:18.629
we know that's where our heart will be and we can lessen our anxieties.

00:08:18.629 --> 00:08:23.029
And we think about faithful servants in the past before Jesus, like David,

00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:25.230
they had anxieties like you and me.

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:26.230
He was a king.

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:31.430
He had many opportunities to be surrounded with spiritual people.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:35.230
But even he faced times that he needed help.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.629
Heat treasure drawing close to Jehovah with prayer.

00:08:38.629 --> 00:08:46.429
In fact, one of my go to scriptures and maybe one of yours is what he said at Psalm 34 and verse 19.

00:08:46.429 --> 00:08:49.629
It's Psalm 94 and verse 19.

00:08:49.629 --> 00:08:51.629
When anxieties or the footnote says,

00:08:51.629 --> 00:08:58.129
disquieting thoughts overwhelm me, you comforted me and soothe me.

00:08:58.129 --> 00:09:03.029
That really helps us when we're going through anxieties and distractions.

00:09:03.029 --> 00:09:07.629
Along with asking Jehovah for help and calmness of heart, calmness of mind,

00:09:07.629 --> 00:09:14.629
we do our best to apply what Paul said at Hebrews 2 and verse 1 to pay more than the usual attention

00:09:14.629 --> 00:09:19.629
to the things we have heard so that we never drift away.

00:09:19.629 --> 00:09:23.230
That's what happened to the man that raised the objection to Jesus.

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:24.330
His mind wandered.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:28.830
He drifted away and he allowed others to be distracted as well.

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:34.129
We want to copy Jesus Christ who always had that spiritual focus well in mind.

00:09:34.129 --> 00:09:42.129
And we want to have our service to Jehovah to the best of our ability to be focused without allowing any distractions

00:09:42.129 --> 00:09:44.129
to take us out of the race for life.
