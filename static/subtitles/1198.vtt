Not a walk where we can't make we take our time, they pray

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:20.570
Make we want them before I'm a gift on time, go read

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.570
If we go preach, to save their life

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.070
Jehovah, go, fit, save us

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.570
Then fit, survive with them, obey

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:42.820
So make we preach, to save people, save people

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:51.869

00:01:46.890 --> 00:02:01.609
To save their life, to save people, save
