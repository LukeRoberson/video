00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.099
An introduction to the book of Esther.

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:08.099
Esther is the second of two Bible books

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.099
bearing a woman's name.

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.099
The Jewish woman Esther is featured

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:15.099
prominently in the account,

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:17.100
which was most likely written by Mordecai,

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.539
Esther's older cousin.

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:22.539
When Esther was orphaned,

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.539
Mordecai became her guardian.

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:27.539
Esther and Mordecai became part of

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.539
the court of King Ahazuerus.

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.539
The royal court was in Shushan.

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:35.539
The city of Shushan was located

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:37.539
in the heart of the Persian Empire,

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:41.539
which spanned from India to Ethiopia.

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:43.539
The book of Esther records events

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:47.539
that began in 493 BCE.

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:50.539
It was written about 475 BCE

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:52.539
and completed before the books

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:55.539
of Ezra and Nehemiah were written.

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:56.539
In Esther's day,

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:58.539
a small remnant of Jews

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:01.539
had already returned to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem,

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.539
but many others still lived

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.540
throughout the Persian Empire.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.540
The book of Esther contains 10 chapters.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.540
Chapters 1 and 2 record

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.540
the Persian King's search

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.540
throughout the Empire for a new Queen.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.540
Esther was finally chosen.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.540
Chapters 3 to 7 disclosed

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.540
how Haman, an enemy of God's people,

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.540
rose to the position of Prime Minister

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.540
and hatched a plot to annihilate the Jews.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.540
Haman used the King's signet ring

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.540
to seal a decree ordering

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.540
the death of all the Jews,

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.540
including Mordecai.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.540
If successful,

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.540
Haman's plan would have cut off

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.540
the family line leading to the Messiah.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.540
Upon learning of the plot,

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.540
Esther decided to follow Mordecai's advice

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.540
and approach King Ahazuerus.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.540
Did you know?

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.540
Appearing before the King unsummoned

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.540
could have met a death sentence.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.540
Only if the King held out his golden scepter

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.540
could the offender be spared.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.870
Esther courageously approached the King

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.870
and exposed the wicked plot.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.870
Upon learning of it,

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:17.870
the King was so furious

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.870
that he had Haman executed.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:22.870
Chapters 8 to 10

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:23.870
relate how Mordecai

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.870
is appointed Prime Minister

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.870
in place of Haman.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:29.870
Esther and Mordecai

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.870
enacted a new legal decree

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.870
sealed with the King's own signet ring

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.870
that authorized the Jews

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.870
to defend themselves when attacked.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.870
The decree was sent throughout the Empire.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.870
Jehovah gave the Jews a great victory

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.870
and preserved the family line

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.870
leading to the Messiah.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.870
As you read this book,

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.870
note how Mordecai and Esther

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.870
skillfully use the Persian legal system

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.870
to protect the Jews.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.870
How Jehovah can deliver his people

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.870
out of any situation.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.870
And how young Esther

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.870
courageously risked her life

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.870
to protect God's people

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.870
and the family line leading to the Messiah.
