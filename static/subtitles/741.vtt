00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:12.400
I'm going to go back in many decades ago, Monday, March 6, 1972.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.160
Some of you in the class weren't alive.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:25.719
I think I know of one for sure, it was alive, that's inside joke, not inside story,

00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:33.799
but anyway, then along with my wife, we had the privilege, and that was rare, unless you

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:40.359
were a Bethelite, to attend the graduation of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead, but it was

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:51.399
the 52nd class. So we're in the assembly hall, jam-packed there in New York City, and just enjoying

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:59.159
what a privilege for us to sit here and enjoy this program at this 52nd class. Now here we are

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:11.079
almost 100, just two-shot classes later, 150th class, and now we're grateful because many are tied

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:18.519
in live as we speak, but then the rest of the brotherhood is going to have it available in a few months.

00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:24.120
So boy, things have changed, and they enjoy that privilege, but that was a rare privilege,

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:34.439
and remember where the nor was the chairman of the program, and certainly he just loved Gilead.

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.760
I mean, that, you've got to give him, of course, you're overused him mightily to get it all started there,

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:47.319
and 43, the first one, but knowing that the beast was coming out,

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:55.159
Jehovah Blessham said, yeah, we need a missionary school. It was a missionary school for years,

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.280
but anyway, the thing I wanted to mention is, I remember an outstanding talk. I'd heard

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.959
where the Fred Franz, the summer before at the Yankee Stadium Convention,

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.800
but we were a little closer there in the assembly hall, and I'll tell you what, I was just glued

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:19.400
to him. If you had the privilege to hear him, Jehovah Blessham had a blessed, beautiful mind. He could

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.560
just quote these scriptures, and I've told folks now, if you don't pay attention to stay with them,

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.280
you're going to get lost. He's going to lose you, but if you pay attention, it was thrilling.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.039
Just the hero, poor, out his heart, because it was all written on his figurative heart.

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:42.439
But he discussed it. He's asked, he's five. That's why I was thinking to bring it up for your

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.520
class here, because this is really directed to you. And he spoke there about vows.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:57.400
And those first seven verses, dreams are mentioned. And I appreciate it, because it just struck me

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.879
when he mentioned that the dreams don't refer to dreams one has while they're sleeping because

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:11.319
of a busy day. Now, you can't get that on your own. Just reading at Cleasy Asties with whatever

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:20.039
version you had. It had to do with getting sidetracked, with personal pursuits, these dreams.

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:26.599
These are the things they're doing. And that would be vanity, as we'd said then.

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:31.879
So let's just take a moment for you here in the class. And others are going to follow along

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:36.039
on Cleasy Asties five. Just touch on some of the nice things. And of course, you can

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:42.840
now, you don't do it right now, but you can do it later. You have access to the research guide

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:52.280
and in depth understanding of this wisdom and Ecclesiastes. And Brother Francis addressed it.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:04:00.520
For example, verse one, watch your step. So this is for here, you are soon to be graduates.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:07.400
Joe, hope it's saying, watch your step. Don't stop doing that. You have thus far, so continue to watch

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:16.920
your step. And he mentions those morally stupid ones. That's not you. You're going to avoid that.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.920
And then I love this in verse two. Do not be quick with your mouth.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.160
Boy, there's a lot of people in the world who benefit from that counsel. That's true.

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:36.920
It's like, does he or she ever shut up? I mean, they must, I bet you they talk in their sleep.

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:44.120
They just won't shut up. Then anyway, don't be quick with your mouth, particularly in context here.

00:04:45.079 --> 00:04:50.680
When you're speaking to Jehovah, oh boy, that's some good things to give to this. You brothers

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:57.079
that will speak in public, but you sisters too, when it's personal with your prayers to Jehovah,

00:04:57.079 --> 00:05:00.920
don't be quick with your mouth. When you approach the sovereign of the universe,

00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:11.639
your words should be few. You do not impress God with vocabulary. He's impressed with sincerity of

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:22.040
heart, loves those that love him and all different languages. He treasures those prayers.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:29.000
And then he mentions this about a dream comes from too many preoccupations in the revised

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:37.480
Bible here. Too many cares. So this idea isn't just dreams from a busy, busy day. This preoccupation

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:47.160
with self is being warned against here. Don't do it. They do not do it. Don't be preoccupied

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:55.000
with yourself. And those that are there, many words from them, but be careful. You know,

00:05:56.519 --> 00:06:02.120
you have the privilege now. You'll be praying more in public. Probably then you have

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:07.480
ever before. You get privileges, you know. And when you're praying to Jehovah,

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:14.519
sometimes we don't want to be counseling, criticizing prayers. We try to be careful with that,

00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:22.839
but sometimes you even hear a prayer at best, and it's like, okay, we're trying to eat breakfast here.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:32.920
And I told folks, it's like, you know, I just can't help it. Jesus is there. Most eloquent

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:40.279
person to walk the planet. And the meal comes. He raises his eyes to heaven and gave things.

00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:50.680
Amen. Let's eat. I mean, there are other times you want to pour out your heart and all that,

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:57.160
but you're not praying to the audience. You're talking to the sovereign of the universe.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:03.399
The council is, you know, you know, now I'm a Gillian graduate. Your brother's particularly,

00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:12.360
I might have longer prayers. I hope not. I sure hope not. Unless they're private. But then he gets

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:21.800
into something crucial. And it's just so important to keep my in verse four. Let's read four and

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:30.759
five, whenever you make a vow to God, do not delay to pay it. For he finds no pleasure in the stupid

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:41.639
ones, morally stupid, then very clear what you vow, pay, what you vow, pay. And then it's better for

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:51.000
you not to vow than to vow and not pay. So this is serious counsel. And the warning don't allow

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:59.000
you're most to cause you to sin. Now, so when it comes to vows and some of you are married,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.399
well, you had the vow. You always have to hold onto that. That's not a light matter what you

00:08:05.399 --> 00:08:11.240
have got. And in the other vows, be careful. If you're going to make a vow, it's between you

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:19.639
and him. But see, notice here, do not allow in verse six to your mouth to cause you to sin.

00:08:19.639 --> 00:08:28.279
And do not say before the angel, you see, think about this, that it was a mistake. So Jehovah has

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:34.440
the angels doing all sorts of things. We don't even begin to know the things that are always going

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:42.360
on all the time. Jehovah served as holy angels. It's priceless. But see, angels are

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:49.799
according to this sign to check on these things. So you don't say to the angel, well, look,

00:08:49.799 --> 00:09:00.200
I made a mistake. Forgive me. You made a vow. But see, it shouldn't be because an angel is going to

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:07.799
check if that's Jehovah's direction. It should be because of our love for Jehovah.

00:09:08.519 --> 00:09:14.759
When you make a vow, you know, there was marriage or whatever, your love for Jehovah,

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:25.879
that's what cements the vow. It matters. See, it matters to him. So then finally,

00:09:27.399 --> 00:09:36.039
verse seven, for just as many preoccupations lead to dreams, so too many words lead to futility.

00:09:36.759 --> 00:09:46.840
So good counsel. You are so filled with the word of God. This is a special class and

00:09:48.519 --> 00:09:54.759
gilly. There's a special school. We have other schools, SKE. I'll mention something later about

00:09:54.759 --> 00:10:02.120
that. But this is unique to have men Jehovah's appointed to instruct teaching committee,

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:11.879
selects them totally whole sold and devoted to Jehovah God teaching you during the class.

00:10:11.879 --> 00:10:20.120
And you're going over all these things in the word of God. So it's all in there and it's just special.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:29.159
So you think Jehovah that you have this education and you're going to move forward to glorify him.

00:10:29.799 --> 00:10:37.399
See, and that's pretty well similar to what it's mentioned here in the last sentence in verse seven,

00:10:38.919 --> 00:10:47.480
but fear the true God. So you soon to be graduates, keep those words in your heart.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:57.240
Just fear the true God in the days ahead and stay away from these kind of dreams about self

00:10:57.799 --> 00:11:09.480
preoccupation, you know. No, not for you. And otherwise your education was futile.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:17.639
Not good. And I don't see that in any of you and not in applying, but such wise counsel

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:26.600
from Jehovah God in his word. So there's much, much more there. Enjoy thinking about it with a little

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:35.639
tool we have there with the research guide.
