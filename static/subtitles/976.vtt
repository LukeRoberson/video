00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:07.929
An 18-year-old brother was trying to decide what he wanted to do after high school.

00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:15.169
He was raised in the truth, and in his heart he wanted to be a pioneer, but he also had

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:21.929
a scholarship to go to university and some other grants, and he had been accepted to attend.

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:28.149
He had many questions, how was he going to support himself, and much pressure from his

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:36.469
teachers and counselors to go to university? What decision would he make? Well, maybe many

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:42.549
of you young ones who are listening to this talk right now are facing that same decision,

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:50.950
or maybe you will be in a year or two. What path will you take? Well, now here's what we know.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:01:00.229
Jehovah wants you to have not just a good life, not just an average life, he wants you to have an

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:09.510
awesome, wonderful life, both now during your youth, but really for your entire life. That's why

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:19.030
the Bible says, in Ecclesiastes, chapter 11 and verse 9, rejoice young man while you were young,

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:29.109
and let your heart be glad in the days of your youth. Well, many young people have found real joy

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:37.510
and peace by choosing a career in the full-time service, but now when we say full-time service,

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:44.629
what are we talking about? Well, full-time service is not just one thing. It actually includes many

00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:51.750
things. It includes pioneering, maybe in your home congregation, or maybe in another area,

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.629
maybe in another city, state, province, even in another country. It might mean assisting with

00:01:58.629 --> 00:02:04.310
theocratic construction projects, maybe building kingdom halls or assembly halls or building

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:11.030
remote translation offices or even working at building at Bethel facilities. And it also could

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.789
mean submitting an application for Bethel service and becoming a Bethelite. Really,

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:25.590
there are so many wonderful opportunities that are available for you, young ones, in full-time

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:35.509
service. But now here's a question. What challenges could prevent you from starting or continuing

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:42.949
on the path of full-time service? And more importantly, how can you overcome those challenges?

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:52.150
Well, let's talk about three obstacles. Here's the first one. It's financial concerns. How am I

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:59.590
going to support myself? Well, let's look at something that Jesus said in Matthew, chapter 6,

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:12.400
6, verse 33, Matthew 6, verse 33, Jesus said, keep on then seeking first the kingdom and his

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:22.319
righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you. Well, now, okay, it says all these

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:28.800
other things. What other things? What is Jesus talking about here? Well, to find out, when do we go

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:35.520
back up to verse 25? And let's read a little bit more of what Jesus was talking about when he said

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:44.879
those famous words, verse 25, on this account, I say to you, stop being anxious about your lives

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:51.039
as to what you will eat or what you will drink or about your bodies as to what you will wear.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.280
Does not life mean more than food and the body than clothing? Now, after identifying, now,

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.800
we know what Jesus is talking about. He's talking about our necessities, food, shelter, clothing.

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:10.240
But now, look at the illustrations Jesus goes on to give now, beginning here in verse 26,

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:19.600
observe intently the birds of heaven. They do not so seed or reap or gather into storehouses,

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:27.759
yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth more than they are? Who of you by being

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:33.920
anxious can add one qubit to his life's man? Also, why are you anxious about clothing?

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:41.199
Take a lesson from the lilies of the field, how they grow, they do not toil, nor do they spin.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.920
But I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.560
Now, if this is how God clothes the vegetation of the field that's here today and tomorrow is

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:04.079
thrown into the oven, will he not much rather cloth you, you with little faith? So, never be anxious

00:05:04.079 --> 00:05:09.519
and say, what are we to eat or what are we to drink or what are we to wear for all these or the

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:17.519
things the nations are eagerly pursuing? Your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:25.920
Well, do you get the sense of this? Jesus was trying to reason that just as Jehovah provides

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:33.519
for all of his creation, he can provide for you too. We just need to develop our faith

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:40.079
that Jehovah will provide the things we need if we put his service first.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.399
Well, does that mean that Jehovah is just going to drop into our lap everything that we need?

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:53.439
Well, no. Jehovah expects that we're going to use the things that he's given us to be able to

00:05:53.439 --> 00:06:01.439
support ourselves. So, it's very wise when you're young to plan ahead so that you can obtain the

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:09.120
skills you need to be able to support yourself. Now, in some lands, it may be that as you're growing

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:14.879
up, you can learn a trade from your Father or from your mother or maybe even from another relative.

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:21.360
In other lands, you might be able while you're still in high school to take some vocational

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:27.759
courses that would help you to learn a skill or learn a trade. But here's the point.

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:36.639
We need to plan. So, ask yourself, what abilities and skills do I have that I could use to support

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:43.759
myself? A sister named Kelly had a very clear goal in mind of becoming a pioneer. So, what did she do?

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:50.399
Well, this is what she says. I had to choose something that would allow me to support myself in my

00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:57.920
ministry. Kelly enrolled in a vocational program in her high school. And that helped her to achieve

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:05.920
her primary goal. Here's what she said. The full-time ministry was what I wanted to do. Everything

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:13.680
else was secondary. Well, how does Kelly feel now about the decision that she made? She says,

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:20.399
I feel my decision was the best one that I could have made. You young brothers and sisters,

00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:27.519
you can overcome that challenge just by planning ahead and making sure that you have practical

00:07:27.519 --> 00:07:35.279
skills you can use to support yourself. Here's the second obstacle. Pressure from others.

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:45.519
My relatives want me to focus on making money. Well, if that's the case, explain your spiritual goals

00:07:45.519 --> 00:07:53.600
in a calm, respectful way. Colossians chapter four in verse six says, let your words always be

00:07:53.600 --> 00:08:01.040
gracious, seasoned with salt. Well, we all know when we eat food with no salt, it doesn't taste very

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:08.399
good, doesn't it? You put a little salt on it, now it becomes delicious. So make sure that when

00:08:08.399 --> 00:08:14.319
you speak to your relatives, you put a little salt on those words so that you can reason with them

00:08:14.319 --> 00:08:20.959
and help them to see the wisdom of the decision that you want to make. Well, it could be your

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:26.800
relatives will not agree with you. But let's look at something that Jesus said here at Luke chapter

00:08:26.879 --> 00:08:38.399
seven and verse 35. Jesus said all the same. Wisdom is proved righteous, or now if you look at the

00:08:38.399 --> 00:08:48.799
footnote, it says, or is vindicated by all its children. Well, now what's the point? Well, sometimes

00:08:48.799 --> 00:08:54.720
when people make a decision, we're not sure if it was the right one or not, but when the decision

00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:02.240
works out well, when it leads to success, when when people see how happy you are and how successful

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:08.879
you are, the joy, the satisfaction you have, well, then what happens? Well, maybe your relatives

00:09:08.879 --> 00:09:15.919
will see that your decision has been vindicated. It's been proved righteous by the way things have

00:09:15.919 --> 00:09:24.159
turned out. Here's obstacle number three, unexpected challenges. I thought it was going to be

00:09:24.159 --> 00:09:32.639
easier than this. Well, those unexpected challenges can be many. It could be just trying to get

00:09:32.639 --> 00:09:39.279
used to new roommates dealing with personality challenges or even just coping with homesickness.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:47.840
Here's the point. Don't give up. Notice what James said here in James chapter one.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:59.519
James chapter one and verse four. Now you notice, as you look at verse two, James is talking about

00:09:59.519 --> 00:10:05.840
trials and he's talking about how trials can have a positive effect on us, but now look what he says

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:14.879
in verse four, but let endurance complete its work so that you may be complete and sound in all

00:10:14.879 --> 00:10:24.320
respects not lacking in anything. What's James trying to say? What's his point? Well, have you ever heard

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:32.720
the expression no pain, no gain? Well, if you want to reach a certain fitness goal or if you want to

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:39.120
be very good at playing a certain sport, no doubt you're going to have some aching muscles and no

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:44.159
doubt you're going to have some hurt pride along the way too. Maybe you won't be very good when you

00:10:44.159 --> 00:10:50.960
first start, but what do you do? If you want to become good, if you want to reach your goal,

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:57.919
you can't give up. You have to keep trying. Well, the same could be said about reaching our

00:10:57.919 --> 00:11:06.480
spiritual goals. You see, James mentions that trials often reveal our weaknesses. Maybe it's

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:13.200
some aspect of our personality that needs improvement or maybe it's something in our relationship

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:22.080
with Jehovah. Maybe we need greater faith. Maybe we need greater trust. If we endure even during periods

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:31.840
of trial and we refuse to give up, we become stronger. We become stronger in our spirituality and our

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:39.039
relationship with Jehovah, our love for him, our faith in him, our trust in him just continues to

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.399
grow. As James says, there in verse four, we become complete or sound in all respects,

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:56.480
not lacking in anything. So when those trials come and they will come, don't look for a quick way out.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:05.039
Endure. Keep going. Don't give up. Seek advice from brothers and sisters who have successfully

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:12.000
coped with similar challenges and you too will be successful. In the following video,

00:12:13.039 --> 00:12:18.720
notice how some full-time servants have found real peace despite those three obstacles,

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:23.919
financial concerns, pressure from others and unexpected challenges.

00:12:26.639 --> 00:12:31.120
I pray to Jehovah, if it is your will, I would be happy to enter Pioneer Service.

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:36.870
But I had to work really hard to provide for the needs of my family,

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:47.409
because my father had died when he was 45 years old. The elder I talked to gave me advice not to

00:12:47.409 --> 00:12:54.610
be picky on what kind of job I would have. He reminded me of Matthew 633 and told me not to be overly

00:12:54.610 --> 00:13:01.970
anxious. Because of our good communication within the family, we were able to find solutions.

00:13:02.769 --> 00:13:07.889
My resemblings realized that they also shared responsibility in providing for the needs of the family.

00:13:09.649 --> 00:13:16.289
After one year of pioneering, I was encouraged to apply for Bethel Service. And now I am in Bethel.

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:23.970
I feel that Jehovah really cares for me, loves me and appreciates all my efforts.

00:13:28.049 --> 00:13:36.549
Because they love me, my cousins pressured me to choose a secular career. If I went against their

00:13:36.549 --> 00:13:42.629
wishes, it would hurt them and put a strain on our relationship. I was really anxious.

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:49.990
I wanted to show my trust in Jehovah by pioneering and give him an opportunity to show me that I

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:59.320
can be happy in his service. I tried to express my appreciation for my cousins by what I said and did

00:14:02.769 --> 00:14:12.149
and showed them love. They realized that I have changed for the better. I show more concern for

00:14:12.149 --> 00:14:18.870
others now. Now they understand that we have been learning good things and that we have a happier

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:28.129
and more meaningful life. I wanted to try serving where the need was great. When I first arrived,

00:14:28.129 --> 00:14:35.090
I thought it was so cool being there. I had expected the poverty, but when I saw it hit home more

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:41.250
than what I had expected. So then I started to feel really homesick. But my brothers and sisters

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:45.570
I'd go to the Kingdom Hall and they were able to cope with the challenges that they were facing

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:51.730
because they had Jehovah in their life. So that, their example really helped me to see that my

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:59.889
circumstances don't need to change from attitude to change. Proverbs 15, 15 stood out to me

00:14:59.889 --> 00:15:06.370
with having a cheerful heart and being able to have a continual feast no matter what my circumstances

00:15:07.009 --> 00:15:14.129
are. And I found an article about that scripture and so from there I decided to ask myself how can

00:15:14.129 --> 00:15:19.570
I use my situation and what I'm learning to help others and got to start helping with foreign

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:27.570
language group there. That whole experience just made my love for people grow so much and

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:38.600
definitely changed my life. Some of your non-witness family members might offer you secular or financial

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:45.240
advice. We know they mean well and they feel that they're giving you the best advice because they

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:54.120
love you. But young brothers and sisters, we are convinced that the blessings of full-time service

00:15:54.120 --> 00:16:02.039
far outweigh any challenges that might go along with it. Just think of the experiences that we

00:16:02.039 --> 00:16:09.399
heard in the video. Harley's choices allowed him to go to Bethel and helped him to feel that

00:16:09.399 --> 00:16:16.759
Jehovah really loved him. Angel's choices took courage but those choices helped him to be more

00:16:16.759 --> 00:16:22.759
concerned about other people and helped his relatives to see that he had made a good decision.

00:16:23.879 --> 00:16:31.720
And Carly did not give up when the trials came. Instead she learned to love other people even more

00:16:32.039 --> 00:16:42.120
and became a more powerful strong Christian. Brothers and sisters, why are we so convinced

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:49.080
that full-time service will lead you young ones to a wonderful life? Well it's because that's

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:55.240
the decision that so many of us made when we were young. Do you remember that 18-year-old young

00:16:55.240 --> 00:17:01.960
brother who is trying to decide which path to take? Well that was me some years ago.

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:11.559
I'm so glad that with the help of Jehovah and my parents and other mature friends in the congregation,

00:17:12.519 --> 00:17:19.000
I made the decision just like so many other brothers and sisters around the world to turn

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:26.359
down that scholarship to give up university and go directly into the full-time service.

00:17:27.559 --> 00:17:34.920
That is a decision that I have never regretted. That is a decision that I will never regret.

00:17:36.119 --> 00:17:42.680
Young people, Jehovah loves you. He wants you to have a wonderful, awesome life.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:49.079
Choose the path of full-time service if you can. You will never regret it.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:58.599
It will put you on a path that leads to joy and peace with our marvelous, wonderful God, Jehovah.
