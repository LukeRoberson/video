00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.630
Do you find it easy to think up effective illustrations for the ministry?

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.630
I sure don't.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.630
But some have a real gift for it.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.630
I have a friend like that.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.629
He can look at almost any situation and think of an illustration.

00:00:19.629 --> 00:00:24.629
One day, we were traveling along Mounton Road.

00:00:24.629 --> 00:00:26.629
I was driving.

00:00:26.629 --> 00:00:30.629
My car wasn't very good. It was the best I could afford at the time.

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:34.630
And suddenly, a red warning light came on.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.630
Quick as a flash, my friend said, I just thought of a great illustration.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.630
The conscience is like a warning light.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.630
His first thought, an illustration.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.630
His second thought, oh, oh, we're in trouble.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.630
Illustrations come naturally to him.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.630
It's just like breathing to him.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.630
Some have the gift and the rest of us have to work at it.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.630
But why should we work at it?

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.629
Why should we learn to use illustrations?

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.629
Well, for one thing, because Jesus used them, and he was the greatest teacher of them all.

00:01:09.629 --> 00:01:18.629
Jesus used illustrations all along, as we find when we read Matthew chapter 13 and verse 34.

00:01:18.629 --> 00:01:20.629
I'll give you a moment.

00:01:20.629 --> 00:01:27.939
Let's read this together. Matthew chapter 13 and verse 34.

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.939
All these things, Jesus spoke to the crowds by illustrations.

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:39.939
Indeed, without an illustration, he would not speak to them.

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:45.939
Jesus knew that an illustration is often the most effective way to touch the heart.

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:50.939
And that's especially true if people are featured in the illustration.

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.939
Now, suppose I say, if you're going along the road and you see someone in trouble,

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:58.939
stop and help him, even if he's of a different race.

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.939
That's clear. It makes the point.

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:06.939
Jesus' illustration about the neighborly Samaritan makes the same point,

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:08.939
but it's so much more effective.

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:12.939
It stirs the emotions. It engages the mind.

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:16.939
We feel pity for the poor Jew who fell among thieves.

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:21.939
We feel love for the Samaritan who stopped to help him and discussed

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:25.939
for the priest and Levite who didn't stop,

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.939
where it determined not to be like them.

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:32.939
An illustration can put a human face on a problem

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:36.939
and reinforce our determination to apply the lesson.

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:42.939
A good illustration can help a Bible student grasp a point he's been struggling with.

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:44.939
Let's see how that works.

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:49.939
In a conversation, Nita is having with Jade in a coffee shop.

00:02:49.939 --> 00:03:12.620
Let's do this.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.620
Bit of a neat freak.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.620
You don't say.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.620
So, last time we discussed how God created us to live forever,

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.620
which raises the question, why do we die?

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:23.620
Totally.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.620
Totally what?

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.620
No, like I mean, I totally agree. That's what we talked about.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.620
Right.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.620
Let's open to Romans 5, verse 12.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:41.569
Wait, why don't I read it out loud so we can both enjoy it?

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:47.039
That is why, just as through one man,

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:51.039
sin entered into the world and death through sin.

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:57.039
And so death spread to all men because they had all sinned.

00:03:57.039 --> 00:04:00.039
Okay, hold it. Is Adam the one man?

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:02.039
Exactly.

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:04.039
This doesn't make sense.

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:07.039
You said Adam was perfect and wouldn't die.

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:08.039
That's right.

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:12.039
But then he sins and loses that.

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:14.039
So what's that got to do with me?

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:16.040
I die because he's stupid.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:22.250
Well, maybe not how I would have put it.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.250
Maybe we can think of it this way.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.250
When parents with a severe genetic defect have children,

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.250
what happens?

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.250
Usually the kids inherit it.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.250
Precisely.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.250
When Adam sinned, that sin became like a genetic defect

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.250
that caused sickness, aging, and death.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.250
And since we're all his children,

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:50.139
oh, brilliant.

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.139
I get it.

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:55.139
Why don't we watch a little video that helps put it all together?

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:10.550
Why was Nita's illustration effective?

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:16.550
Jade was struggling to understand how she could inherit imperfection from Adam,

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.550
a man who lived long ago,

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.550
and she wasn't going to get past it.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.550
So that was the point Nita chose to illustrate.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.550
So when you're studying with someone,

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.550
choose carefully what you'll illustrate.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.550
Let it be a main point in the lesson,

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.550
or an idea that your student is having trouble with.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:41.990
There has to be a good reason for using an illustration.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.990
Our illustrations should be appealing.

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.990
What do we mean by that?

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.990
An illustration will appeal to the student

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.990
if it's about something familiar.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.990
Now again, Jesus' parable of the Samaritan comes to mind.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.990
The setting of the illustration was nearby,

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.990
a familiar road between Jerusalem and Jericho,

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.990
not the hanging gardens of Babylon or the pyramids of Egypt,

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.990
and it was realistic.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.990
There were many robberies along that road,

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.990
and the attitude of the priest and Levite toward that poor, injured Jew

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.990
totally believable.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.990
Nita also chose wisely.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.990
Her illustration was about inheriting a birth defect,

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.990
something she knew Jade would understand.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.990
Now you may have a couple of go-to illustrations

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.990
that you've used for years and years and years.

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.990
Why not look for fresh ones that make the same points?

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.990
Put a little sparkle back on your ministry.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:48.269
Let's consider two ways of doing that.

00:06:48.269 --> 00:06:51.269
First, be observant.

00:06:51.269 --> 00:06:54.269
Matthew 6.26, Jesus says,

00:06:54.269 --> 00:06:59.269
observe intently the birds of the heavens.

00:06:59.269 --> 00:07:01.269
Jesus was aware of his surroundings,

00:07:01.269 --> 00:07:03.269
and he thought about what he saw.

00:07:03.269 --> 00:07:05.269
He observed the housewife,

00:07:05.269 --> 00:07:07.269
children playing in the village square,

00:07:07.269 --> 00:07:09.269
the farmer,

00:07:09.269 --> 00:07:11.269
the rich man with his treasures.

00:07:11.269 --> 00:07:13.269
So learn from Jesus,

00:07:13.269 --> 00:07:16.269
slow down and smell the flowers.

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:21.269
Then think of an illustration about flowers.

00:07:21.269 --> 00:07:25.269
But what if you feel you don't have a creative bone in your body,

00:07:25.269 --> 00:07:28.269
and yet you still need fresh illustrations?

00:07:28.269 --> 00:07:30.269
Our second resource,

00:07:30.269 --> 00:07:31.269
our publications.

00:07:31.269 --> 00:07:35.269
Turn to the Watchtower Publications Index under Illustrations,

00:07:35.269 --> 00:07:39.269
and you'll find an abundance of beautiful illustrations

00:07:39.269 --> 00:07:41.269
that have been used in our publications.

00:07:41.269 --> 00:07:44.269
And as you're studying our later publications,

00:07:44.269 --> 00:07:48.269
take note of the illustrations that are used.

00:07:48.269 --> 00:07:51.269
Choose simple illustrations.

00:07:51.269 --> 00:07:55.269
Use little things to explain big things,

00:07:55.269 --> 00:07:59.269
and simple things to explain complicated things.

00:07:59.269 --> 00:08:02.269
A sister at a congregation meeting

00:08:02.269 --> 00:08:05.269
used a very simple but effective illustration

00:08:05.269 --> 00:08:08.269
regarding Jehovah and the ransom.

00:08:08.269 --> 00:08:09.269
She said,

00:08:09.269 --> 00:08:11.269
When you're shopping,

00:08:11.269 --> 00:08:15.269
you never pay full price for damaged goods.

00:08:15.269 --> 00:08:17.269
Her point?

00:08:17.269 --> 00:08:19.269
We're all damaged goods.

00:08:19.269 --> 00:08:22.269
Yet Jehovah paid full price for us

00:08:22.269 --> 00:08:24.269
with the life of his son.

00:08:24.269 --> 00:08:26.269
The illustration was simple.

00:08:26.269 --> 00:08:30.269
It was appealing because it was about something familiar,

00:08:30.269 --> 00:08:31.269
shopping.

00:08:31.269 --> 00:08:34.269
It was also appropriate to the audience,

00:08:34.269 --> 00:08:36.269
and there were a lot of batholites in the audience,

00:08:36.269 --> 00:08:40.269
and it's never paid full price for anything.

00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:42.269
When you're illustrating a point,

00:08:42.269 --> 00:08:45.269
avoid distracting the student with minor details.

00:08:45.269 --> 00:08:47.269
Minor details, if they don't fit,

00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:50.269
they can get you into a lot of trouble.

00:08:50.269 --> 00:08:53.269
If they don't work with the main point of the illustration,

00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:56.269
the student may focus on the inconsistencies

00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:59.269
and miss the point altogether.

00:08:59.269 --> 00:09:02.269
Well, in summary, what do we say?

00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:05.269
It takes time to develop good illustrations,

00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:07.269
but it's worth the effort.

00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:09.269
If you have the gift, use it,

00:09:09.269 --> 00:09:11.269
and share it with others.

00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:14.269
But if like me, you don't have the gift, work at it.

00:09:14.269 --> 00:09:16.269
You'll be glad you did.

00:09:16.269 --> 00:09:20.269
And so will your Bible students.

00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:22.269
Now, brother Kenneth Flodin,

00:09:22.269 --> 00:09:24.269
a helper to the Teaching Committee,

00:09:24.269 --> 00:09:27.269
will present the next part of the symposium,

00:09:27.269 --> 00:09:30.269
experience the joy of disciplemaking,

00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:32.269
improve your skills,

00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:35.269
teaching with enthusiasm.
