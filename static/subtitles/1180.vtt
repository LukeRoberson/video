00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:11.259
Anita and I came here to Honduras, as missionaries, as single people, and Anita came here one year before I did.

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:20.899
I graduated from Giliad in 1974. I was so excited.

00:00:20.899 --> 00:00:29.210
But on the flight to Honduras, a feeling of loneliness and anxiety overpowered me.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.210
I was sitting there all by myself, and I thought, what if they forgot that I'm coming?

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.210
That nobody's still waiting for me, or they never got the information.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:49.149
One night, Charlie, after arriving in my assignment, suddenly my bed started to shake.

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.149
And I thought, what on earth is going on?

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.149
I had no idea because I never experienced an earthquake before my life.

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:04.980
But then I heard a voice.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.739
That means in English, Joseph, come on down quick.

00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:16.739
So I came down, and I saw my dear friends Ramon and Melodya, who came from their house to check on me.

00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:24.549
I was so happy to see them, and I gave them a big bear hug, I almost cried.

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.549
Because of their hospitality, friendship, and love for me.

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:35.459
When I stepped down the airplane, I saw a group of people.

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:38.459
And I realized they're my brothers.

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:42.459
I'm not alone. That's my new family. They're waiting for me.

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:52.480
Before the years have passed since we arrived in Madura.
