Romany people in many parts of the world are subject to prejudice and discrimination.

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:17.179
But in the summer of 2017, they for the first time ever experienced a regional convention in their own language.

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:22.179
Delegates from 12 different countries came to Macedonia to attend the convention.

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:29.179
The program was presented in the Romany languages spoken in Macedonia, Bulgaria and Serbia.

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:35.179
Since 2007, Bible literature has been translated into Romany in Macedonia,

00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:38.179
and the release of the book Lessons You Can Learn from the Bible

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:43.179
brought great joy to both the many children and their parents.

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:50.179
This convention was truly a witness that Jehovah is the God of impartial love.

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:55.179
I never thought that we would have a convention in Romany.

00:00:55.179 --> 00:01:00.179
It tends to directly into your heart when you hear it in your own language.

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:07.180
We could hardly wait for this Romany convention and especially the songs that touched our hearts.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.180
In the world, not all kinds of people are loved, but for Jehovah, they are all significant.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.180
And I am happy that I am serving a God who is so impartial and to whom all nations are the same.
