WEBVTT

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.040
What is this?

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.799
Where did you find this?

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:19.629
In the fields.

00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:21.150
Come along.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.790
I need to show you something.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.269
I never told you about my past.

00:01:26.269 --> 00:01:37.310
How are you?

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.390
Josiah, you're still young now.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.790
One day you'll learn more about my life.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.500
I did many bad things.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.280
I used to worship false gods instead of Java.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.700
I even brought idols into the temple.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:10.189
I upset Jehovah very much.

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:16.479
And he disciplined me.

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:21.199
I begged Jehovah to forgive me.

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:23.439
Did he forgive you?

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:29.039
Yes. His mercy is great.

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:34.800
Now these are the words of Jehovah's Prophet Isaiah.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.520
All who form carved images amount to nothing

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.439
and their cherished objects will be of no benefit.

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:50.319
As their witnesses they see nothing

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.080
and know nothing.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.280
Now I want you to read these words down here

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.560
about a man who cuts down a tree.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.120
Let's see what he does with it.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.280
Half of it he burns up in a fire with that half.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.280
He roasts the meat that he eats

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.439
and he is satisfied.

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:21.439
He also warms himself and says,

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:23.120
Ah, I am warm.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.599
I watch the fire.

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:27.919
Is that bad grandpa?

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:29.199
No my son.

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:34.900
But let's see what he does with the other half.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.300
But the rest of it he makes into a god

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.500
into his carved image.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.419
He bows down to it and worships it.

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:54.020
He prays to it and says,

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.340
Save me for you are my god.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.860
That's wrong.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.300
Why? Is it wrong, Josiah?

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.979
Because it's not Jehovah.

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:06.819
It's just a tree.

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.500
How does Jehovah feel about doing something like that?

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.340
Jehovah doesn't want us to serve any other gods?

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.060
Right, besides.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.259
Can any other god listen to our prayers?

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:23.300
No, only Jehovah.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.540
And Jehovah wants to hear your prayers, Josiah.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.779
I always pray to him.

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:35.740
Pray to him many times a day from your heart.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.339
That shows you love him and want to be his friend.

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:43.740
If you make a mistake,

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.420
pray to Jehovah to forgive you.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.579
Even for a hundred mistakes.

00:04:49.579 --> 00:04:51.980
Even for a hundred.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.259
A thousand?

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:54.860
Yes.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.019
A thousand thousand.

00:04:57.019 --> 00:04:58.939
Even that many.

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:01.579
If you pray to Jehovah to forgive you

00:05:01.579 --> 00:05:04.620
and you really keep trying

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:15.629
to do what is right.

00:05:15.629 --> 00:06:11.600
Josiah, your grandfather needs to rest.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.439
Finish trying your story.

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:14.879
Where was I?

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:17.120
The angel.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.120
Right.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:32.370
Then, Jehovah's angel came down and he destroyed 185,000 of synacryps troops.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:33.250
Really?

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:34.449
Yes.

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:36.209
King has a kaya learned

00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:39.250
that we can always trust in Jehovah.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.529
I'll be going to the temple with you.

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:50.829
Zephaniah, you shouldn't fill the boys head with such stories.

00:06:50.829 --> 00:06:52.430
The king told me to take Josiah to the temple.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:53.870
I know where you're going.

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.470
I don't care what my father told you.

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:59.329
The boy isn't what?

00:06:59.329 --> 00:07:00.850
Father, what are you doing out of that?

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:04.610
Josiah wanted to go to the temple.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:08.290
I had Zephaniah take him along ahead of me.

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:11.250
You may not want to join us,

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:15.170
but you will not prevent Josiah from going.

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:40.910
You wish.

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:42.350
This is a good one.

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:50.430
Who should I be this time?

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:52.110
I want to be King Solomon.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.750
I was thinking I could be King David.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:08:30.079
King Minas is asking for it.

00:08:30.079 --> 00:08:39.259
Josiah, he's on his way, my lord.

00:08:39.259 --> 00:08:46.500
Josiah, my son, listen to me.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:51.899
Grandfather, you have to get better.

00:08:51.899 --> 00:08:53.500
I'm afraid of being alone.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:58.580
You're not alone.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.460
Jehovah is with you.

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:06.340
And so is your cousin, Zephaniah.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:10.019
Jehovah is holy.

00:09:10.019 --> 00:09:16.100
And you must serve him the way he wants us to.

00:09:16.179 --> 00:09:25.100
And only that way, the sacrifices and celebrations at the temple,

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:29.899
they help us be friends with Jehovah.

00:09:29.899 --> 00:09:36.460
I tried to restore pure worship,

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:44.100
but the people still sacrifice on the high places.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:50.830
Jehovah's temple, we've neglected it.

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:56.909
How happy the people were when they worship Jehovah,

00:09:56.909 --> 00:09:59.710
the right way.

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:12.820
Jehovah's temple and worship can be like that again.

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:19.940
Look at me, serve Jehovah Josiah,

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:25.379
all other gods, powerless,

00:10:25.379 --> 00:12:09.950
worship Jehovah the right way.

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:21.279
Jehovah's temple and worship can be like that again.

00:12:21.279 --> 00:13:10.500
Josiah, how's business?

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.659
The Venetian monols are beautiful,

00:13:12.659 --> 00:13:15.299
and they're selling briskly by matten.

00:13:15.299 --> 00:13:18.659
Excellent. We're making a bigger profit on them too.

00:13:18.659 --> 00:13:23.950
They will bring blessings from Bale.

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:28.029
I can see the crops flourishing already.

00:13:28.029 --> 00:13:30.909
Jehovah doesn't like this.

00:13:30.909 --> 00:13:38.590
Stop it. We need the help of all the gods,

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:44.029
not just Jehovah. That's not a grandfather taught me.

00:13:44.029 --> 00:13:48.669
He said all of their gods are powerless.

00:13:48.669 --> 00:13:59.519
Your grandfather, new tofeth, better than anyone.

00:13:59.519 --> 00:14:04.799
You, my son, can become a mighty man with Jehovah's help

00:14:04.799 --> 00:14:09.649
and Bale's. That's not right.

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:12.289
That's not right.

00:14:12.289 --> 00:14:13.809
If we're going to worship Jehovah,

00:14:13.809 --> 00:14:15.730
then we need to go to the temple.

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:20.899
Grandfather, never mind what your grandfather said.

00:14:20.899 --> 00:14:24.610
He's been dead for two years.

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:30.100
You are not to speak of him again. Understand?

00:14:30.100 --> 00:15:02.379
Zephaniah.

00:15:02.379 --> 00:15:48.220
Eden, Josiah, take him. Don't break his seat.

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:55.679
Oh, other gods are powerless.

00:15:55.679 --> 00:15:56.480
Go.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:27.870
Not near. Not standing before Bale.

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:31.549
If this year Bale gives us no rain,

00:16:31.549 --> 00:16:35.570
we will certainly know why.

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:39.090
What the boy did today was.

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:45.919
Alasphemous. What do you expect?

00:16:45.919 --> 00:16:48.799
He spent all of his time with my father.

00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:55.539
He must be punished. Hold your tongue if you want to keep it.

00:16:55.539 --> 00:16:59.860
You may be a priest of Bale, but do not forget whose king here.

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:04.980
Most certainly will not.

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:08.180
Good. Now go.

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:11.140
Take that with you.

00:17:11.140 --> 00:18:31.549
No. It will remain here for you to reflect upon my Lord, the king.

00:18:31.549 --> 00:18:34.910
Jehovah is with you.

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:38.589
And so is your cause of Zephaniah.

00:18:38.589 --> 00:18:56.339
The king.

00:18:56.339 --> 00:19:33.569
There's a king.

00:19:33.569 --> 00:19:38.369
Zephaniah. Profit of Jehovah. So good to see you too.

00:19:38.369 --> 00:19:40.450
My king.

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:45.009
I know you must feel so overwhelmed by all this.

00:19:45.009 --> 00:19:47.490
I will truly miss your father.

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:54.769
He was a good, tolerant man who allowed everyone to worship as they wished.

00:19:54.769 --> 00:20:00.450
You know, your father consulted with me regularly

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:04.450
on very important matters.

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:11.099
Josiah, can we still shoot arrows sometimes?

00:20:11.099 --> 00:20:14.240
Maybe.

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.720
We'll leave you, my Lord.

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:22.589
Again, my sincerest condolences for the loss of your father.

00:20:22.589 --> 00:20:43.039
I'm here whenever you need me.

00:20:43.039 --> 00:20:52.690
Okay. Let's try again.

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:55.970
Keep your hand steady like this.

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:58.529
Remember, don't focus on the arrow.

00:20:58.529 --> 00:21:01.789
Focus on the target.

00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:04.109
Like this?

00:21:04.109 --> 00:21:20.509
Good. You've improved.

00:21:20.509 --> 00:21:25.230
Eonen, I'd almost given up on you. We're almost done.

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:28.190
Eonen, I see you can hit center first.

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:31.230
There's no contest. You have more time to practice.

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:36.190
I have to practice so I can defeat Jehovah's enemies.

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:40.829
The history of the kings teaches us much about good and bad.

00:21:40.829 --> 00:21:45.549
When we carefully study their lives, we learn that we need to love Jehovah

00:21:45.549 --> 00:21:48.109
and hate what is bad.

00:21:48.109 --> 00:21:50.349
Yes, we know. But why does it matter?

00:21:50.349 --> 00:21:52.109
We're most kings bad anyway.

00:21:52.109 --> 00:21:54.990
That's true. Some were.

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:59.789
They didn't trust in Jehovah and they didn't draw close to him.

00:21:59.789 --> 00:22:02.430
When the king does not search for Jehovah,

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:06.109
everyone suffers. Even the good people.

00:22:06.109 --> 00:22:12.640
All the more reason to learn from their mistakes.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:17.519
Do you understand what kind of influence a king has?

00:22:17.519 --> 00:22:19.839
I think so.

00:22:19.839 --> 00:22:21.519
My grandfather was a great man.

00:22:21.519 --> 00:22:25.519
My father says that King Manasseh may have been a little brutal,

00:22:25.519 --> 00:22:28.400
but he was effective and he was tolerant.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.720
He gave the people many freedoms.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:35.279
Eonen, having freedom means having responsibility.

00:22:35.279 --> 00:22:38.480
The responsibility. He coagain.

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:42.799
The responsibility to choose who we will serve.

00:22:42.799 --> 00:22:47.420
Jehovah or other gods.

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:51.420
My father says that after the Assyrians released Manasseh,

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:53.980
worshiping only one god weakened him.

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:58.380
And he started ruling like an old woman.

00:22:58.380 --> 00:22:59.660
That's not true.

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:02.700
My grandfather learned the hard way that Jehovah is the only true god.

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:03.980
And you just insulted him.

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:07.180
My father simply sees the mistakes your grandfather made.

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:09.099
Your father should keep his views to himself.

00:23:09.099 --> 00:23:10.779
How can you say that?

00:23:10.779 --> 00:23:13.339
Your father trusted him and you should too.

00:23:13.339 --> 00:23:17.259
Besides, you can be loyal to Jehovah and to bail,

00:23:17.259 --> 00:23:20.140
Malcolm or any other god at the same time.

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:23.789
You don't honestly believe that.

00:23:23.789 --> 00:23:24.829
I do.

00:23:26.829 --> 00:23:28.430
Your father keeps confusing people.

00:23:30.349 --> 00:23:32.589
So are you telling me I should disrespect him?

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:37.950
What about the power that says, listen to your father who caused your birth?

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:41.069
Eonen, we must respect our parents.

00:23:41.069 --> 00:23:44.829
But all of us, including our parents,

00:23:44.829 --> 00:23:46.910
owe our lives to Jehovah.

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:50.509
If we just go along with our parents and doing something Jehovah hates,

00:23:51.309 --> 00:23:53.789
aren't we honoring them more than Jehovah?

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:58.160
You just make me so mad.

00:23:59.119 --> 00:24:01.279
My grandfather was a great man.

00:24:01.279 --> 00:24:02.559
And you insult him?

00:24:03.599 --> 00:24:06.880
So if I'm not as a prophet, you must listen to him.

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:10.289
Prophets come and go.

00:24:11.809 --> 00:24:14.049
He's not even old enough to be a real prophet.

00:24:14.769 --> 00:24:17.170
What does he, 25 of the most?

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:18.930
And why do we only need a worship Jehovah?

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:21.410
People worship lots of gods.

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:23.569
Be careful what you say around Josiah.

00:24:24.289 --> 00:24:28.130
His overrighteous spirit may one day turn dangerous.

00:24:29.009 --> 00:24:32.049
You need to help him be more balanced.

00:24:32.769 --> 00:24:33.650
Reason him.

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:33.970
How?

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:38.130
Sepheniah says he has a spirit like David.

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:43.380
Unfaithful David.

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:47.220
Who stole another man's wife?

00:24:51.789 --> 00:24:52.269
What is it?

00:24:58.109 --> 00:24:58.829
Talk to me.

00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:09.009
What if Josiah is right?

00:25:10.289 --> 00:25:11.329
Right about what?

00:25:12.049 --> 00:25:16.130
What if there really is only one true God?

00:25:19.059 --> 00:25:19.380
Son.

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:24.500
Josiah doesn't see the bigger picture.

00:25:26.579 --> 00:25:29.859
His grandfather did before he weakened.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:33.599
What can I do?

00:25:35.599 --> 00:25:36.240
Talk to him.

00:25:38.529 --> 00:25:40.049
Help him to be a good king.

00:25:41.809 --> 00:25:42.450
Tolerant.

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:44.210
Like Manasseh was.

00:25:46.289 --> 00:25:47.490
Here's what you can tell him.

00:25:55.230 --> 00:26:04.799
Josiah, I just wanted to apologize.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.160
I shouldn't have spoken to you like that yesterday.

00:26:10.339 --> 00:26:11.059
That's all right.

00:26:11.859 --> 00:26:12.500
I forgave you.

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:14.259
I don't want any problems between us.

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:17.059
It's just, what if you're wrong?

00:26:19.059 --> 00:26:20.740
What if Bill worship is important?

00:26:21.859 --> 00:26:22.500
Think about it.

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:26.180
Bill is the God of the life giving reigns.

00:26:27.059 --> 00:26:30.980
And your father and grandfather sacrifice on the high places.

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:35.460
But what if Bill puts up the reigns because you don't?

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:39.380
The crops would die and the people would starve.

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:43.619
And then they would revolt against you.

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:51.259
I know how you feel about Jehovah.

00:26:52.619 --> 00:26:57.579
But isn't it better to offer the other sacrifices too?

00:26:58.859 --> 00:26:59.579
Just in case?

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:06.019
Why would I worry about that?

00:27:06.819 --> 00:27:09.619
When it's only Jehovah who can control the weather?

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:13.619
Not some false reign, God.

00:27:19.809 --> 00:27:25.009
Why don't you remember King Solomon wrote all the streams?

00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:29.569
All the streams flow into the sea.

00:27:30.849 --> 00:27:32.049
Yet the sea is not full.

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:35.650
To a place from which the streams flow,

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:40.130
there they return so as to flow again.

00:27:41.009 --> 00:27:41.490
That's right.

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:43.569
Just as Jehovah designed.

00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:46.529
We study that school together.

00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:50.930
Well, some people say this girls have been altered.

00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:54.529
Maybe the gods are trying to tell us that.

00:27:54.529 --> 00:27:55.569
Do you remember when we were little?

00:27:57.089 --> 00:27:58.210
We would play in the fields.

00:28:00.539 --> 00:28:00.940
Of course.

00:28:02.539 --> 00:28:04.299
You always wanted to be King Solomon.

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:09.099
Jehovah gave Solomon wisdom and riches.

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:12.539
But do you also remember the end of the story?

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:16.779
His wives inclined his heart to follow other gods.

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:20.779
His heart wasn't complete with Jehovah like David's was.

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:25.539
I don't want to make that same mistake.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:42.559
What are you drawing?

00:28:44.609 --> 00:28:45.329
It's the temple.

00:28:46.289 --> 00:28:51.170
My grandfather told me how beautiful the temple was when people would worship Jehovah properly.

00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:56.660
He said it could be that way again.

00:29:04.769 --> 00:29:06.529
I'll tell you what I intend to do as King.

00:29:08.819 --> 00:29:09.940
You don't understand.

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:13.140
Just I have plans to tear down all the high places.

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:18.400
I understand, all right.

00:29:19.839 --> 00:29:22.319
What is extremist ideas?

00:29:23.119 --> 00:29:25.039
Become the law of the land?

00:29:25.839 --> 00:29:28.240
There will no longer be any joy.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.079
No tolerance.

00:29:31.279 --> 00:29:32.720
No freedom of worship.

00:29:33.759 --> 00:29:36.640
Only narrow minded bones.

00:29:37.839 --> 00:29:39.759
And oppressed people.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.759
Do you understand that?

00:30:17.019 --> 00:30:27.009
Holy, you must inserve him.

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:29.410
The way he wants us to.

00:30:31.009 --> 00:30:32.769
And only that way.

00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:38.930
You my son can become a mighty man.

00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:41.089
With Jehovah's help.

00:30:46.109 --> 00:30:49.710
When the king does not search for Jehovah, everyone suffers.

00:30:51.549 --> 00:30:53.710
Even the good people, even the good sufferers.

00:30:55.549 --> 00:30:56.430
What if you're wrong?

00:30:58.109 --> 00:31:01.069
Isn't it better to offer the other sacrifices too?

00:31:03.069 --> 00:31:03.869
Just in case.

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:34.190
Don't Jehovah.
