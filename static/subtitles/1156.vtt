00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:09.580
This symposium has helped us to appreciate even more Jehovah's love for families.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.439
And we appreciate this gift, the Bible, which could serve as a blueprint for families,

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:20.260
to have a loving, warm, safe environment.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:27.739
And you young ones, you play a vital role in contributing to the joy in your family life.

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:31.559
Your mother, your father, they love you very much.

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:36.679
And they want to have a close, personal, loving relationship with you.

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:43.079
And it's their heartfelt desire that you have a close, personal, loving relationship

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.560
with your Heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:52.520
They want you to be happy now and for the rest of your life, everlasting life.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:59.679
In the previous talk, we understood how Jehovah wants parents to train their children,

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:01.799
but with what purpose?

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:09.799
Notice what Proverbs chapter 22 and verse 6 gives us instructions for parents.

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:17.480
There in verse 6, it reads, train a boy, or the footnote says, child or youth, in the way

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.400
he should go.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.319
Even when he grows old, he will not depart from it.

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:31.439
So what is Jehovah asking of your parents to train you, to train you in such a way that

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:38.640
you will always serve Jehovah from your youth all the way to your adulthood, and really

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.319
for the rest of your life?

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:46.079
So Jehovah doesn't spell out every single detail for parents on how they should instruct

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.959
you and how they should train you.

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:50.760
That's left up to them.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.519
And so they need to prayerfully think about what would be best for your family and for

00:01:55.519 --> 00:01:59.280
you as a child personally.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.640
This means that they will make house rules, sometimes you'll get chores, maybe curfews.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.520
You will get reminders, correction, and discipline.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.080
Why?

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.560
Because they love you.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.599
And because they're doing their best to listen and obey Jehovah, and his instructions

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:24.960
are to train you, discipline you, so you can serve Jehovah forever.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.800
It's not an easy assignment.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:33.120
They need all the help that they can get from Jehovah, as well as from you, especially

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.319
when they make rules that you may not like.

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.520
What you can and cannot wear.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.000
What you can and cannot listen to or watch.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.080
Or who you pick as close friends.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.400
These are decisions that are left to your parents.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.120
Now will your parents always make the perfect decision, the perfect rule?

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.120
No.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.319
Breaking news, it's not news to you that they will make mistakes.

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:00.840
They're imperfect.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.960
But they love you and they're doing the best they can to give you the best training possible.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.159
So you can love Jehovah and serve him forever.

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:15.639
We know that you love and appreciate all that your parents do for you.

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:17.919
But let's be real.

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:21.879
Sometimes you don't understand the reason for the rule.

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:24.680
Or you simply don't agree with it.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.680
What do you do?

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.080
Well, you get frustrated.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.479
But that's okay.

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:30.479
We've been there.

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:35.599
We were your age at one time and we completely understand that it could be frustrating.

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:41.280
But we know that this will pass because you'll understand why they're doing this.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.360
It's out of love.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.439
So when you don't see eye to eye, what are you supposed to do?

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:52.360
Well sometimes you need to change your view.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.639
Much has to do with how you view your parents.

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:03.520
How you view your mother and your father will affect how much or how little you respect

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.199
them.

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:08.599
Listen to them and obey them.

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:12.159
And here's a question we'd like to pose to you children.

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:20.000
Do you sometimes view your parents as prison guards or lifeguards?

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.079
Interesting question.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.920
Prison guards are trained to keep a close watch over prisoners because they don't really

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.199
trust them.

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.720
They keep them confined with many restrictions.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:38.199
They tell them what to do and when to do it, when to get up and when to go to sleep.

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:40.800
What they will eat and when they will eat.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.680
But they will wear and all kinds of other rules.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.160
They keep all these restrictions because they don't trust them.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.720
Do you view your parents as prison guards at times?

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.079
Well you might, especially if you want more freedom, more independence.

00:04:58.079 --> 00:05:02.519
And if it seems like they don't really trust you, they're watching every single move that

00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:04.120
you make.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.759
You might feel confined because of all the rules and restrictions.

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:11.759
What about lifeguards?

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:17.439
Well lifeguards also watch people, they watch swimmers, but for a very different reason.

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:19.279
They want to keep them safe.

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:22.519
They want to make sure that they do not swim into danger.

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:27.319
So from their lifeguard tower, they keep a close watch over all the swimmers.

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:32.720
Sometimes they will use their whistle to warn you of danger, to keep away from riptides

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.680
or maybe sharks, things that you're not aware of.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.560
Do you view your parents as lifeguards?

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.279
We hope so because they are.

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:49.000
It's been said that you could spend years wishing your parents would get off your back

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.800
only to realize that they're the only ones who ever really had your back.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:00.519
Yes, your parents like lifeguards are looking out for your best interest.

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:05.079
They've always had your back and they always will.

00:06:05.079 --> 00:06:10.120
They want to make sure that you avoid being drawn into the dangerous currents in this

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:15.639
wicked world, dangers that you may not be aware of.

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:18.399
Do you want to be happier?

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:23.839
Do you want to have more trust from your parents, more freedom, more independence?

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:29.279
If so, you might have to change your view of your parents and don't view them in a negative

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:38.079
way like their prison guards, but view them like lifeguards, safeguarding your life.

00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:44.439
Your parents love you very much and their training will pay off if you listen.

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:46.759
And that's what Jehovah is asking you to do.

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:51.879
While your parents are training you, you need to do your part and that is listen.

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:59.000
And that's what our scripture at Proverbs chapter 23 has for an assignment for you.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.040
It's chapter 23 of Proverbs in verse 22.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:10.879
And there verse 22 says to you children, listen to your father who caused your birth and

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:18.120
do not despise or dislike your mother just because she has grown old.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:24.199
So although it's not easy at times, what is Jehovah asking of you as your parents are

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:28.879
training you, please listen to them.

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:32.079
But what does it mean to listen?

00:07:32.079 --> 00:07:35.160
Listen is more than just hearing words.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:40.040
It's hearing with a view to obey.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:46.639
Listening to your mother and your father means giving them your full attention, undivided

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:48.360
attention.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:55.160
It means turning off your music, taking out your earbuds, putting away your phone and

00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:00.519
devoid rolling your eyes when they're speaking to you.

00:08:00.519 --> 00:08:06.000
At times you may get frustrated, you may get upset, that's understandable.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.319
We all do.

00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:13.839
But how you control your emotions will affect the outcome in the future.

00:08:13.839 --> 00:08:19.959
By listening and obeying your parents, you are building a record of trust that will

00:08:19.959 --> 00:08:24.079
help you in the future when you need to communicate with them.

00:08:24.079 --> 00:08:26.199
Maybe about rules.

00:08:26.199 --> 00:08:29.759
Remember, trust is something that you earn.

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:34.919
It's not something that you demand or that's automatic.

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:40.440
What is the best way for you to speak to your parents about rules that you don't understand

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.440
or maybe that you don't agree with?

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.480
You need to communicate.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.480
Good, open communication.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:57.240
Communication doesn't mean complaining, shouting, whining, maybe replying with sarcasm.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.840
It means calmly.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.519
Tell your parents how you feel.

00:09:02.519 --> 00:09:05.279
Tell them what's on your mind.

00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:09.519
The following Bible verse helps if we can apply it.

00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:14.279
Proverbs 29-11 says, a stupid person gives vent to all his feelings.

00:09:14.279 --> 00:09:17.159
It's out of control, no control.

00:09:17.159 --> 00:09:21.919
But the wise one calmly keeps them in check.

00:09:21.919 --> 00:09:23.240
In control.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.519
That's what we want to try to follow.

00:09:26.519 --> 00:09:31.039
A young woman named Devon tried to do this and this is what she advises.

00:09:31.039 --> 00:09:36.960
She says, I found that when I stayed calm and presented my thoughts clearly, I could

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:42.799
counter my parents to listen and either to reason with me on their decision or to come

00:09:42.799 --> 00:09:46.200
up with another solution.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:50.960
Parents appreciate having a real conversation with their children rather than screaming

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:55.200
matches that end up with slamming doors.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.639
Open communication is what's needed.

00:09:58.639 --> 00:10:01.879
So you young ones, what have we learned?

00:10:01.879 --> 00:10:05.639
We have learned how to view our parents correctly.

00:10:05.639 --> 00:10:11.399
Not as a prison guard, but as a life guard who really wants to save your life, you're

00:10:11.399 --> 00:10:13.159
everlasting life.

00:10:13.159 --> 00:10:16.600
They have your back and they always will.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:21.299
Listening and obeying strengthens your relationship with your parents as well as your Heavenly

00:10:21.299 --> 00:10:23.000
Father Jehovah.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.559
It brings you joy and brings joy to your parents.

00:10:27.559 --> 00:10:33.120
And as you apply the training that your parents are giving to you, you will gain wisdom that

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:40.600
will help you now to make wise decisions so that you can have the real life, yes, everlasting

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.360
life.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:49.159
As you watch the concluding video of this symposium, please notice how these children find joy

00:10:49.159 --> 00:10:50.960
in their parents.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:56.279
Man, I'm so happy today because that fire drove interrupted our mattress, but we have

00:10:56.279 --> 00:10:57.279
to do it tomorrow.

00:10:57.279 --> 00:10:58.639
I'm going to be studying in all night.

00:10:58.639 --> 00:11:03.669
Hey, mom, dad, got a shower before our study.

00:11:03.669 --> 00:11:07.870
No discussion, no excuses now.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:12.610
Okay.

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:14.570
Where did all of this come from?

00:11:15.049 --> 00:11:25.330
We're going to be here all night.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:36.110
It did give us time to think.

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:47.879
They are such good examples.

00:11:47.879 --> 00:11:59.690
Mom never stops working and our home is always, always beautiful.

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:08.789
They give us so much of their time and themselves.

00:12:08.789 --> 00:12:17.309
A bit cheesy sometimes, but overall, they're pretty great.

00:12:17.309 --> 00:12:19.950
That night, they didn't lecture us.

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:25.470
They just reminded us of one thing, and it was pretty deep.

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:32.389
When we dedicate our lives to Jehovah, our lives includes everything.

00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:39.870
Our time, our resources, our home, our kitchen, yes, our kitchen.

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:47.750
And how we care for those things, it reflects on him and on us as your parents.

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:49.870
That kind of sank in.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:52.669
I knew I could do better.

00:12:52.669 --> 00:12:56.669
No mom, we got this.

00:12:56.669 --> 00:12:57.669
We got this?

00:12:57.669 --> 00:13:12.100
Oh, yeah, we got this.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:16.340
Did you notice how the daughters showed respect for their parents?

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:20.860
They did this by listening and obeying their instructions.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.500
What was the key?

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.980
It's how they viewed their parents.

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:30.460
They reflected on their parents' fine example in the ministry at home when they would take

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:35.700
the time and have the patience to help them, to listen to them.

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:40.899
And they saw the joy on their mother's face as she kept the home clean and tidy.

00:13:40.899 --> 00:13:43.500
What a good example.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:49.539
They listened to their parents' advice and then they made personal application.

00:13:49.539 --> 00:13:55.419
They learned that showing respect into family meant helping out with chores, even when

00:13:55.419 --> 00:13:57.779
it meant during the dishes.

00:13:57.779 --> 00:14:02.419
This made their parents happy and the daughters happy as well.

00:14:02.419 --> 00:14:08.460
In this symposium, we considered how husbands and wives, mothers and fathers and children

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:14.340
can all add and contribute to the success of the joy within the family.

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:19.500
They do this by working together in unity, focusing on the positive things in us.

00:14:19.539 --> 00:14:23.820
And having respect for one another.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:29.779
Yes, each and the family, if they apply Bible principles, use Jehovah's Blueprint.

00:14:29.779 --> 00:14:33.580
They know that they can have a successful and happy family.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:36.620
And most of all, we can make Jehovah happy.

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:42.980
Give him honor as the designer, the architect, and the creator of all families.
