WEBVTT

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:15.740
We were spending the afternoon in the pool with my family.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.140
The next day, I woke up and I was having trouble catching my breath, so we went to the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.309
doctor.

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:31.829
A blood test revealed that I had a bacterial infection in my leg called Staphylococcus.

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:39.899
I ended up in the hospital for 55 days.

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.500
I had a colonoscopy, and a few days later, they told me I had colon cancer.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:59.149
They ran some more tests and discovered it had also spread to my liver.

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:08.730
He was a very humble person, caring, yes.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.609
He loved Jehovah very much.

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:13.609
He was a good companion and a great friend.

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:23.530
We were married for almost 25 years, honestly, I don't know why, but he decided to take

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.010
his own life.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:42.769
I never thought that he would choose to do something like that.

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:47.969
I think a word that's even more terrifying than cancer is metastasis.

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:53.329
It was like being caught up in a whirlwind and then plummeting to the ground.

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:59.439
My life as I knew it had now completely changed.

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.959
In total, there were 10 operations.

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:05.519
The first four were the most difficult because there was a possibility that they would have

00:02:05.519 --> 00:02:08.280
to amputate my leg.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:15.039
Every morning, you wake up with an intense anxiety, like a weight on your chest and you

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:19.120
can't breathe.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.840
At first, I thought that Jehovah was just letting all this happen and that he wasn't doing

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.960
anything.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:33.080
If Jesus himself did not expect Jehovah to shield him from trials or to get him out

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:41.319
of them, then I had no right to think, why is this happening to me?

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.719
Actually, the correct thinking is the opposite.

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:47.719
Why shouldn't it also be me?

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:51.599
One day, the doctors came in with some papers saying that the judge had given them permission

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:56.439
to operate on me and give me a blood transfusion that very day.

00:02:56.439 --> 00:03:00.080
Because I was still a minor at the time, I found that my opinion and my decisions were being

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.439
ignored.

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:06.319
So at that moment, I realized that all of this wasn't against me, but against Jehovah.

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:12.210
It became clear to me that everything was in his hands.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.969
I see Jehovah's hands through my brothers and sisters who are always looking out for me.

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:21.889
We decided to speak openly about it with others, but especially with our close friends.

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:28.139
We wanted to tell them even before they asked.

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:34.259
One scripture that others often shared with me says that Jehovah is a protector of widows.

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:40.099
It was a constant reminder that Jehovah was going to take care of me and he did.

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:45.219
It was three months of chemotherapy and then the operation.

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:49.699
They told us the operation could last ten hours.

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:57.780
One thing I remember thinking was, well, when I open my eyes, I will either see the ceiling

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.969
of the operating room or I'll see the new world.

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:09.330
When our family faced economic hardships, my mom made fruit gems to sell.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.330
So I said, well, I guess I need to do the same.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.930
A sister who had a business offered to sell them for me.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:23.370
This helped me so much because I'm not naturally gifted at doing sales.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.689
While reviewing the legal order, it turned out that it contained an error.

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:32.610
My last name is Canal and they added a nest to it.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.209
So they weren't able to use the document that ordered the transfusion that day.

00:04:37.209 --> 00:04:42.769
With time, I began to recover and I started feeling reassured by the fact that I had not

00:04:42.769 --> 00:04:47.600
been judging Jehovah by asking where he was.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.949
Asking that question was a sign that I needed his help.

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:58.829
Whenever anything worries me, I tell myself, wait, Jehovah has always cared for you.

00:04:58.829 --> 00:05:00.709
So he's not going to stop now.

00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:06.660
I have full confidence that Jehovah will take care of me.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.819
My physical health is now the best it can be.

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:17.339
In my spiritual condition with Jehovah, my friendship with him has been greatly strengthened.

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:21.100
We've definitely experienced more good things than bad things.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.699
It's not that we will want to go through it all again.

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:25.500
Absolutely not.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:31.139
But the reality is that in hindsight, with everything I learned about Jehovah, I don't

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.740
know that I would have learned these things, had I not gone through a situation like this.
