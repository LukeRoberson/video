00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:11.849
My daughter will be giving her first talk in the Theocratic Ministry School tonight.

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:19.129
As a Christian father, I feel happy, but I don't know if I deserve to feel this way.

00:00:19.129 --> 00:00:23.370
I ran into some hard times spiritually in the past.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.129
I received the help of the elders.

00:00:26.129 --> 00:00:32.789
They encouraged me, telling me that I am precious in Jehovah's eyes, and that I occupy an important

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:36.030
place among Jehovah's people.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.109
But still, I am plagued by feelings of guilt and worthlessness.

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:50.030
I wish I could just let go of such feelings and be a strong father and husband for my family.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:01:10.530
But these discouraging thoughts continued to drag me down.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.370
My mistakes were well in the past.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:20.909
I accepted the discipline and applied the council that was provided.

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.310
And I have never fallen into the same course of wrongdoing since then.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:33.870
But my demanding heart continues to condemn me.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.790
I love Jehovah very much, and I am grateful for his mercy.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:54.129
But I just don't feel that I am precious in his eyes anymore.

00:01:54.129 --> 00:01:57.849
The elders continued to show sincere interest in me.

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:13.659
Their efforts really helped me together during those difficult times.

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:19.379
They encouraged me to always remember that the way Jehovah views us is much more important

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:23.710
than the way we view ourselves.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:29.469
They used an illustration to convince me of this point.

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:33.229
A boy used to train hard for a marathon at school.

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:40.490
He wanted to make his father proud.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:46.560
But at the actual race, he fell midway through.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.360
He thought his father was no longer proud of him.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:58.439
But the father told his son, you fell once, but you stood back up and finished the race.

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:02.240
I know you trained hard and I see your potential.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.159
I am confident that you will succeed.

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:12.680
They told me that Jehovah sees us the way this father sees his son.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:19.240
And if I stumble and fall, he still sees me as his precious son.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:26.319
The elders also read to me 1 John 3 verses 19 and 20.

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.639
By this, we will know that we originate with the truth.

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:37.159
And we will assure our hearts before him regarding whatever our hearts may condemn us in.

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:41.919
Because God is greater than our hearts and knows all things.

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:48.960
They pointed out that the verb here, to assure, can also mean to persuade.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:55.719
I was encouraged by studying and meditating on the scriptures that I too can persuade

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:59.719
my stubborn heart before God.

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:06.680
That night, I was once again overwhelmed by self-doubt.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:13.840
Being on the account of King David helped me to understand how Jehovah really sees me.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:23.060
As our creator, he is well aware of our weaknesses, as well as our motives and our intentions.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.339
Meditating on these things helped me to regain my self-respect.

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:36.500
I also reflected on the example of King Jehoshaphat in 2 Chronicles 19.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:44.120
The prophet Jehu reproved Jehoshaphat for allying himself with the wicked Ahat.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:52.480
But Jehu also reminded him that Jehovah saw good things in him.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.439
Through Jehu's words and the writings and the scrolls about Jehovah's forgiveness,

00:04:57.439 --> 00:05:08.600
Jehoshaphat was able to persuade his self-condemning heart before Jehovah.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:15.339
Jehovah can see past my mistakes as well.

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:22.180
He remembers my faithful service and sees my true potential and my sincere efforts to

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:35.699
do his will.

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:40.819
Reading and meditating on the Bible can change our view of the situation we find ourselves

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:41.819
in.

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:49.019
Now, I focus on the mercy Jehovah has shown me, and I don't allow my anxieties to rob

00:05:49.019 --> 00:05:53.250
me of my strength.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:58.410
I feel like a heavy burden has been lifted off my shoulders.

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:05.810
I thank Jehovah for persuading my heart to believe that I too can draw close to him

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.769
as one of his precious sons.
