00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:07.179
Have you been infected?

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:10.179
No, no. Not with an actual virus,

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:13.179
but with something that has infected people throughout history.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:16.179
Something that no one is completely immune to.

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:18.179
Prejudice.

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:20.179
Whoa, whoa, you may think,

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:22.179
Prejudice? Me?

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:24.179
That can't be right.

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.179
I like all kinds of people.

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:30.179
The truth is that all of us are capable of,

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.179
or even guilty of,

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:34.179
prejudice to some degree.

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:37.179
But it can be hard to recognize in ourselves.

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:40.179
So, what is prejudice?

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:44.179
To overcome prejudice, you have to understand what it is.

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:48.179
Prejudice often means having a biased opinion,

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:50.179
either good or bad,

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:53.179
of someone you don't even know.

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:55.179
We can be prejudiced against people,

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:57.179
and even treat them badly,

00:00:57.179 --> 00:00:59.179
simply because of their age.

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:01.179
Where they're from.

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:05.180
What they look like.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.180
How much money they have.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.939
Or because of other things that make people different from us.

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.939
But judging others based on appearances

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.939
or superficial traits before getting to know them

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.939
would be unfair and unreasonable.

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.939
It would be like hating a food before you've even tried it.

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.939
Prejudice can lead us to give special treatment to some people

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.939
and exclude others.

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:35.939
It can make us act like we're smarter

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.939
or better than people who are different.

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.939
But that can be dangerous.

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.939
The Bible says at Proverbs 16-18

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:45.939
that pride is before a crash

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.939
and a hotty spirit before stumble.

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.939
Having a superior attitude can keep us from having real friends.

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.939
That can take the joy out of life.

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.939
If you recognize prejudice in your heart,

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:00.939
what can you do?

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:02.939
Try these steps.

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.939
Learn more about those around you.

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.939
What have they experienced in their life?

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.939
What are their talents?

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:15.680
When you appreciate other strengths,

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.680
it can be a powerful antidote to prejudice.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.930
Next, take a look at your friends.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.930
Do they all look, think, and act a lot like you?

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.930
If so, follow the Bible's advice at 2 Corinthians 6-13

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.930
and widen out.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.370
Make friends with people who are different from you.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.370
But what if you discover that some of them practice bad things?

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.370
In that case, stay away.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.370
Their bad conduct can make you act badly.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.370
In this world, prejudice is everywhere.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:01.180
We don't have to let it control our thinking.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.180
We can overcome prejudice.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.180
If we avoid reaching negative conclusions about people,

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.180
before we get to know them,

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.180
make an effort to learn about others,

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.180
and try to make friends with people who are different from us.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.180
The more we know about the people around us,

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.180
the more we can appreciate the things that make us different.
