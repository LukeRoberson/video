00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:08.099
Well, this day has arrived for your students. I see you there smiling and looking forward to this program

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.939
I'm sure it's hard for you to believe that we've actually got to graduation day

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.579
But we also know that you're very keen and

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.940
enthusiastic to get to your assignments whether you're going back to where you came from or you're going to a new assignment

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.100
over the last few months you've learned so much haven't you you've crammed those

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:37.060
That information into your mind and heart and now you've got that ready to implement when you go to your assignments

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.500
But we need to be careful not only to be enthusiastic keen and zealous

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:52.579
But also we need to be patient so we'd like to talk to you for a few moments about this thing be enthusiastic

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.579
But be patient as well

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.060
Why so well when you go to your assignments with all this that you've learned

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.019
You're going to be tempted to try and implement it everywhere

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.459
But remember you you're not going to change the whole world in one day or even the whole branch

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:16.299
You see it's so easy to become

00:01:17.019 --> 00:01:21.420
Overwhelmed if we try to take on too much all at one time

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.780
So that's why it's important to be enthusiastic, but also patient

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.579
Lord Jesus Christ wasn't an excellent example of this

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.859
When Jesus came into the world the whole world needed to hear his message and

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.379
Yet he had to wait some 30 years

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:50.099
Growing up according to Jehovah's timetable before he started his ministry so that took patience on his part, didn't it?

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.180
But what about when Jesus started his ministry?

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:02.700
What was his focus you can imagine him looking around seeing all the things that need to be done in the world at that point

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:07.939
But let's turn our Bibles if you turn with me please to Matthew 15

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:11.939
Matthew 15 and verse 24 and

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.620
Here Jesus said to his apostles. I

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:18.659
Was not sent to anyone

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.020
except the lost sheep of the house of Israel

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.860
That's interesting

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.699
Jesus here mentions he had a specific limited

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:35.699
Assignment what was the assignment to go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:41.020
Now if we turn back just a couple of chapters in chapter 10 of Matthew

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.219
You notice in verses 5 and 6 when Jesus sent out his apostles

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:48.819
What did he say to them?

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:55.460
Do not go off into the road of the nations and do not enter any Samaritan city

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:02.500
But instead go continually to the lost sheep of the house of Israel

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.259
So as Jesus sent out his apostles in this particular instance

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.740
What was he reminding them of?

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:17.780
He was telling them that they likewise had a limited assignment a specific assignment

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.060
They weren't supposed to try and do everything all at once go to the Samaritans to the Gentiles

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.500
They were to focus just on the lost sheep of the house of Israel

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.460
So when we think about this

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:33.979
What do we learn from these two verses?

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:36.539
Well first of all

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:39.099
Yes, the whole world needed to hear the message

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:43.900
But what did Jesus do and what did he expect of his apostles

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:48.780
That they would recognize that they had a specific assignment

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.620
They want to be overwhelmed by trying to think of changing the whole world at that point

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.379
Jesus showed great trust in Jehovah

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:05.259
He knew that Jehovah would gradually expand the message and the reach of the message

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.419
And of course we realize that there was an expansion

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:12.539
Then in 36 CE another expansion

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.740
So what does that mean for you?

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.899
You see when you return to your assignment or you go to the new one

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:24.220
There's going to be endless number of possibilities

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.540
Or where you could help others

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.980
To stabilize, strengthen, everyone

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.379
But if you try to take everything on at once

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.420
You're going to wear yourself out and probably wear out a whole lot of other people as well

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.379
You know the English idiom don't bite off more than you can chew

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.660
You see gradually do the things that Jehovah has assigned you to do

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.259
If you try to be too broad in what you do

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.699
You may end up not accomplishing much at all except just wearing yourself out

00:04:57.579 --> 00:05:03.980
But be patient just as Jesus was in recognizing that each one of you will have a specific assignment

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:06.300
And then try to work at that

00:05:07.019 --> 00:05:11.980
Trusting that Jehovah will allow your good example to benefit others

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:16.699
And gradually the effects of your work will spread to others

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:20.860
Now an example of this is the South Pacific

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.899
If I'll just tell you about that now when missionaries arrive in the South Pacific

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:28.459
That let's take for example

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:33.420
You might end up in a country that has 100 inhabited islands

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:36.699
Now you're a new missionary I remember the feeling

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:42.860
And then you find out there's only 10 islands that have Jehovah's Witnesses on

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:46.939
10 islands that have publishers and congregations

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.420
So there's 90 that don't

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.500
So what do you think the normal enthusiastic responses?

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:58.060
Let's get a boat we have to get a boat we must visit all the 90 islands

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:00.779
That needs to be done now immediately

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.259
Well usually you're assigned to one congregation in one area

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:09.980
Now what's the point?

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.740
What normally happens?

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.220
Well you see if you were to get a boat and there's nothing wrong with getting a boat or visiting out of the

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.459
But if that becomes your focus in you neglect your assignment

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.500
How can you follow up on all the interests that you may find on those 90 islands?

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.620
It's not just enough to go and give them some magazines

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:33.420
But you need to be there with them build them up and congregations are formed

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.819
So normally what happens?

00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:41.819
Well it's amazing to see missionaries and others who work in maybe

00:06:42.459 --> 00:06:46.459
Largest city areas they work diligently at their assignments

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:53.500
But then maybe others from different islands come to visit that city the missionaries and

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:59.660
And they get contacted they show an interest they start to study they return to their home islands

00:07:00.459 --> 00:07:04.779
And what happens gradually the work spreads out to all these islands

00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:07.899
So what's the point

00:07:07.899 --> 00:07:10.699
Don't feel that you have to take on everything

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:19.899
Focus as Jesus did on the limited assignment you have but then along the way you may be surprised at what happens

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.819
Now that's exactly what happened to Jesus

00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:27.339
Let's go back to Matthew chapter 15

00:07:28.459 --> 00:07:31.740
Remember what was the assignment that Jesus had

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.060
In verse 24 he mentioned Israel

00:07:36.779 --> 00:07:43.899
Now looking at this map we see at that time there was actually a border around that area

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.699
That we could say was his territory assignment

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.180
But when Jesus said these words where was he?

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.220
Do you remember let's look at verse 21

00:07:55.339 --> 00:07:59.100
Jesus now went into the region of Tyre and Sidon

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:04.060
So when you look at the map where was Tyre and Sidon

00:08:04.699 --> 00:08:08.300
What do you notice he said he wasn't in his territory

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.420
He was out among the Gentiles

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:18.459
Why when we look at the parallel account that's mentioned in Mark chapter 7

00:08:18.939 --> 00:08:24.220
It tells us that Jesus wanted some time alone with his apostles some downtime

00:08:24.779 --> 00:08:30.620
Because there was so many crowds. I was so busy now. I'm sure all of us can understand that feeling Jesus had

00:08:31.259 --> 00:08:34.940
So he took them out of that general area to this

00:08:36.139 --> 00:08:41.340
Territory that was beyond what he would normally preach in to have some quiet time together

00:08:41.899 --> 00:08:43.340
But what happened?

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:46.460
Well the account tells us there was a Sorrow Phoenician woman

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:53.740
Perhaps of as the study notes help us to see from a Greek background as far as a nationality went

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:59.740
But maybe she was a citizen or an inhabitant of that area of the Sorrow Phoenician area

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.779
So this woman approached Jesus

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.620
pleading with him now she didn't look like a Jewish person

00:09:07.179 --> 00:09:09.500
She probably didn't even speak Hebrew

00:09:10.779 --> 00:09:15.419
She certainly wasn't in the category of the lost ones of the House of Israel

00:09:16.539 --> 00:09:18.059
So Jesus

00:09:18.059 --> 00:09:24.779
Initially when she started to make these efforts to to talk to him he mentioned this to his apostles in verse 24

00:09:25.179 --> 00:09:27.179
That's our assignment

00:09:27.899 --> 00:09:32.460
But notice this was a little different in the sense that this woman

00:09:33.659 --> 00:09:38.940
showed an appreciation for who Jesus was notice in verse 22

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:43.659
She said have mercy on me Lord son of David

00:09:44.379 --> 00:09:46.379
Now here's a Gentile woman

00:09:47.179 --> 00:09:49.179
She really know who David was

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:56.940
And by saying the son of David as the study note indicates perhaps she was showing face in the fact that

00:09:57.179 --> 00:09:59.179
Jesus is the Messiah

00:10:00.299 --> 00:10:03.019
So she wasn't your average Sorrow Phoenician person

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:11.179
What did Jesus do well he tested her little he did emphasize the fact in a household

00:10:12.139 --> 00:10:14.460
You first of all feed the children the family

00:10:15.419 --> 00:10:19.740
And then the little dogs get fed afterwards and he perhaps he was playing on words there

00:10:20.379 --> 00:10:24.220
It's interesting. We're not sure what language Jesus was speaking to her

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:29.500
The watchtower did say that Jesus perhaps did understand Greek and use it at times

00:10:30.059 --> 00:10:35.179
Why his apostles obviously understood some Greek they wrote some of the books of the Bible in Greek

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:43.899
But whatever the case the record of this is written the inspired record is in Greek and it uses this term little dogs

00:10:45.259 --> 00:10:52.220
Was that an offensive? No as it's mentioned it was an affectionate term like saying puppies or pets

00:10:53.179 --> 00:10:54.779
So whatever the case

00:10:55.899 --> 00:11:00.860
He must have looked very friendly perhaps out of the smaller in his face because she was not deterred

00:11:02.059 --> 00:11:04.059
What was Jesus reaction?

00:11:04.299 --> 00:11:12.220
Well, he acknowledged his territory his assignment, but then in verse 28 he said oh woman great is your faith

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.659
Let it happen to you as you wish

00:11:17.259 --> 00:11:22.139
Is this the only time that Jesus did something like this for a non-Jewish person?

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:29.419
Remember and John chapter four and not only do we have this case of the Syrophonician woman, but John

00:11:29.419 --> 00:11:32.139
Forer we've told about the Samaritan woman

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:39.580
this non-Jewish person was witness to and then even members of her village

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.700
accepted Jesus as the Messiah

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:50.139
And then what about the Roman army officer that Jesus was able to help and he mentioned that

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:54.220
Jesus hadn't even seen that type of faith in all of Israel

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:58.220
So what lesson do we learn from this?

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:05.980
Well Jesus focused on his assignment. He always acknowledged what was he's assigned to do

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.899
But when opportunities came up along the way

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:14.379
To help those who weren't necessarily in his assignment

00:12:15.179 --> 00:12:19.500
He still gave them some help because they were genuine persons who needed help

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:27.820
Yes, although Jesus realized it wasn't yet the time to expand the work. He was willing to reach out to these ones as well

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:31.899
So what's the lesson for all of us?

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:36.379
Well when you go to your assignments you will have a specific assignments

00:12:37.259 --> 00:12:39.820
Now if it's in a Bethel or in the field

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.460
At you'll know what your assignment is

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:49.259
So don't start looking at all the other assignments that are around and how you can help them and what you need to do and

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:51.740
Why don't they change?

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:55.100
Yeah, I mean you've changed a lot in the last few months, but remember they haven't

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.860
And they survive without you

00:13:01.259 --> 00:13:06.460
So what's the key focus on your assignment

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:12.220
Be zealous be enthusiastic, but also be patient

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:18.139
Yes, have trust in Jehovah that if you focus on your assignment you work hard

00:13:18.539 --> 00:13:21.580
You take out whatever opportunities come your way along the way

00:13:22.139 --> 00:13:25.899
Then you can be sure you will be blessed because you're enthusiastic

00:13:26.539 --> 00:13:28.539
But also patient
