WEBVTT

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:08.039
In this update, we're going to talk about how we can make good use of our time during

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:14.679
the pandemic, but first, we'd like to share a few updates.

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:24.800
We're sad to report that as of December 10th, we have lost 25,658 brothers and sisters

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.320
to COVID-19.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:34.100
Our prayers are certainly with all who have lost loved ones.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:40.740
Recently, the new Omicron variant has received a lot of news coverage.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:46.100
At this point, there are still many unknowns.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.539
Brothers and sisters, we don't need to panic.

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:57.380
Keep following the same basic precautions that have worked well, wearing masks, physical

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:06.140
distancing, frequently washing our hands and getting vaccinated, if possible.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:13.459
In the 2021 governing body, update number seven, Brother Loish mentioned that over 80 percent

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:18.140
of the worldwide Bethel family was vaccinated.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.859
We are glad to inform you that now, over 99 percent of our worldwide Bethel family

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:26.739
is vaccinated.

00:01:26.739 --> 00:01:35.269
And so are over 95 percent of our special full-time servants in the field.

00:01:35.269 --> 00:01:41.510
Many of our brothers and sisters have had good results from being vaccinated.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:49.870
For example, in some parts of Bulgaria, the local clergy say that vaccines are poison

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.310
from the devil.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.750
So there's much pressure in the community not to get vaccinated.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.670
Despite this, one sister in her husband watched the governing body updates and made their

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.789
personal decision to get vaccinated.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.150
Later the sister's employer called her and said that in order to comply with government

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.469
regulations, she couldn't return to work if she had not been vaccinated.

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:28.750
How surprised the manager was to learn that the sister was already vaccinated.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.909
In fact, she was the only employee who was vaccinated.

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:38.069
Everyone else had to be laid off.

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:44.110
The manager asked our sister if she had any vaccinated friends who could replace the

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.110
employees who had been fired.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.270
The manager then called other witnesses that she knew to see if they had any vaccinated

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.509
friends who needed employment.

00:02:57.509 --> 00:03:03.430
That evening all the positions were nearly filled.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:11.189
The head of staff asked our sisters, how do you know so many vaccinated women a fine

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:14.069
witness was given?

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:21.550
In the end, 14 sisters and one Bible student were employed because they followed the good

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:28.590
guidance and Bible principles that have been shared in our various governing body updates.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:38.389
Now, let's get back to our topic of putting our time to good use during the pandemic.

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:44.349
It's been exciting to hear how many of you have reached out to Pioneer, started new

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:50.669
study projects, and refined your telephone and letter writing skills.

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:54.069
That is time well spent.

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:03.030
In this month's update, we will discuss two additional ways we can use our time wisely.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:09.870
Learning in active ones and improving our reading and writing skills.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:16.110
It has been wonderful to see so many of our brothers and sisters who were in active

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:21.230
begin associating with us again during the pandemic.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:30.550
If that describes you, please know that the governing body warmly welcomes you back.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.709
Imagine the joy that Jehovah and Jesus and all the angels in heaven have experienced

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:39.389
at seeing you return.

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:44.509
But what about those who have not yet returned?

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:52.310
They might feel like the Psalmist has recorded at Psalm 119, verse 176.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:05:00.230
There we read, I have strayed like a lost sheep, search for your servant, for I have not

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.949
forgotten your commandments.

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:10.829
Right now, some in active ones may be pranked Jehovah saying, search for me.

00:05:10.829 --> 00:05:13.750
I need help to come back.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.509
They haven't forgotten Jehovah.

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:22.990
But for various reasons, they haven't been able to come back on their own.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.709
How does Jehovah feel about such ones?

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:35.269
Psalm 34 verses 15 and 16 says, I myself will feed my sheep.

00:05:35.269 --> 00:05:43.149
The lost one I will search for, the stray I will bring back, the injured I will bandage

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:46.670
in the week I will strengthen.

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:51.509
Can Jehovah use you to find his lost sheep?

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:53.629
Absolutely.

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:57.149
Many of you have reached out to in active ones.

00:05:57.149 --> 00:06:03.870
In the following video, notice how publishers took the initiative to help others return

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.670
to Jehovah.

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.829
I didn't know what my brother was ever going to do about the truth.

00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:14.069
As a teenager, he was a publisher in the congregation.

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:20.750
By the time he was 16, he sadly decided to leave home and he then no longer served Jehovah.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:27.629
But then when we came back to Seattle and settled down, then we had more contact with him.

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:32.470
My wife and I had been providing meals for him because his wife had a brain tumor, but

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.949
the beautiful thing is our congregation.

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:40.670
They started taking in meals when my brother's wife was hospitalized, but they even assisted

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:44.069
at the hospital to visit him and give him encouragement.

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:45.670
And that had a big impact upon him.

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:48.790
He could see the closeness of the congregation.

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.430
And I think that built a desire that he would really like to do more.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:57.029
When my brother went to the kingdom hall, he was only able to do that for two weeks and

00:06:57.149 --> 00:07:02.149
then COVID struck, but an elder talked to him the first time he went to the kingdom hall

00:07:02.149 --> 00:07:04.670
and they exchanged phone numbers.

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:10.589
And so they were able to communicate and that elder helped study him up in the Zoom and

00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:14.350
he was able to attend the meetings and he went to all the meetings.

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:19.949
And then I encouraged him to have a personal study and he said, well, I'm doing my study.

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:21.949
Of all things, it was a terminology.

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:26.069
He didn't know about having a personal Bible study with someone.

00:07:26.069 --> 00:07:30.910
So then he said some more encouragement from a family friend that found out that he was

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.430
coming to meetings and then he started up to have his own Bible study.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.149
And that's when he really started to make progress.

00:07:37.149 --> 00:07:39.189
It took 59 years.

00:07:39.189 --> 00:07:46.750
Here I had the privilege of actually performing the baptism for my own brother.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:51.990
At the beginning of the pandemic, we knew that our ministry was going to change.

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:56.910
And so we thought about what to do and we came up with this little project, making a list

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:01.829
of all the inactive people that we could think of, that we'd been in other congregations,

00:08:01.829 --> 00:08:05.589
lots of young people and others.

00:08:05.589 --> 00:08:09.149
And when we did that list, there was about 40 people on that list.

00:08:09.149 --> 00:08:16.149
So we've emailed, we've called, we've texted, and we've written lots of letters.

00:08:16.149 --> 00:08:21.990
Some of them we haven't heard anything from, but nobody has rejected our efforts.

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:26.069
I contacted one man who I had met almost 40 years ago.

00:08:26.069 --> 00:08:30.069
When I was 19 years old, we reestablished contact.

00:08:30.069 --> 00:08:32.549
He began to attend all the meetings on Zoom.

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:35.629
And now we're studying the Bible in the enjoy life forever book.

00:08:35.629 --> 00:08:40.590
We contacted one brother who'd been inactive for many years.

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:44.190
Now he attends all the meetings on Zoom.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:50.590
He has been reactivated and all of this despite some very serious health problems.

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:55.509
Patients and persistence are required when reaching out to these dear ones.

00:08:55.509 --> 00:09:00.509
We love them and so we contact some on that list every week.

00:09:00.509 --> 00:09:03.950
We're so happy.

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:09.029
Three of the persons that we contacted are now regularly attending the meetings.

00:09:09.029 --> 00:09:11.389
Two of them are studying the Bible.

00:09:11.389 --> 00:09:17.789
It's really been encouraging for us to see these ones that we love so much return to Jehovah.

00:09:17.789 --> 00:09:24.059
And really, if Jehovah is drawing them, they're going to respond.

00:09:24.059 --> 00:09:31.220
I'm sure you agree that Jehovah blessed these efforts to reach out to his lost sheep.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:36.659
What a wonderful way to use our time during the pandemic.

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:42.820
One circuit over here in the United States recently reported that 76 individuals in his

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:46.940
circuit had been reactivated.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:51.820
That's the equivalent of an entire congregation.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:57.940
We encourage you to prayerfully think of inactive ones that you might know.

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:02.500
It could be a family member or a friend.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:08.659
Can you give them a call or send them a letter or a text message?

00:10:08.659 --> 00:10:14.980
And if they respond and attend a meeting, make them feel welcome.

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:23.340
We hope that many more lost sheep will return to Jehovah before the end.

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:29.059
Another good use of our time is improving our reading and writing skills.

00:10:29.059 --> 00:10:34.379
Reading and writing has always been important for Jehovah's people.

00:10:34.379 --> 00:10:40.820
Remember the kings of Israel were told to write out a copy of the law and read from

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:45.379
it all the days of their life.

00:10:45.379 --> 00:10:50.259
Jesus was raised by a poor family, yet he was able to read.

00:10:50.259 --> 00:10:54.019
Remember the time when he went into the synagogue in Nazareth?

00:10:54.019 --> 00:11:00.580
He was able to open the Isaiah scroll, which had no chapters and verses, and locate and

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:04.659
read the correct scripture.

00:11:04.659 --> 00:11:08.340
And let's not forget what Paul told Timothy.

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:16.460
Timothy was already an elder, yet Paul said to him, continue applying yourself to public

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:19.179
reading.

00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:26.860
So in view of the Bible's emphasis on reading, it is not surprising that God's organization

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:34.419
has a wonderful history of helping people all over the world to learn to read.

00:11:34.419 --> 00:11:40.580
Over the past 70 years, Jehovah's Witnesses have taught thousands of people worldwide to

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.740
read and write.

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:53.580
For example, in Mexico, we have helped more than 156,000 people to learn to read and write.

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:58.220
We've received awards in several countries for our efforts.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:00.580
What about today?

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:05.700
It's true that now in many languages, we have technology that enables us to listen to

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:13.740
our publications, but we don't want to be content to rely on audio publications alone.

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:20.139
We want to be able to read and to study the Bible for ourselves and to dig into the wonderful

00:12:20.139 --> 00:12:25.820
information provided by the faithful and discreet slave.

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:32.059
Under some other benefits that come from learning to read well, a new article was recently

00:12:32.059 --> 00:12:40.299
published on JW.org entitled Why Reading is Important for Children.

00:12:40.299 --> 00:12:46.860
This was prepared with you dear parents in mind, but really, reading is something that

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:51.580
all of us should view as important.

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.460
Why?

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:58.419
The article explained that reading stirs the imagination.

00:12:58.419 --> 00:13:04.820
It builds character and helps us to reason on our problems.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:13.500
It helps us develop qualities such as patience, self-control, and empathy, and reading promotes

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:17.529
deep thinking.

00:13:17.529 --> 00:13:24.049
During the pandemic, some of our brothers have been making good use of their time by learning

00:13:24.049 --> 00:13:26.490
to read and write.

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:30.730
Let's hear how they have benefited.

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:35.129
When the coronavirus broke out throughout the country, schools were shut down, and many

00:13:35.129 --> 00:13:38.929
parents either couldn't go to work or they had to work from home.

00:13:38.929 --> 00:13:43.649
One circuit overseer set a goal to encourage the parents in his circuit to take advantage

00:13:43.649 --> 00:13:47.970
of the opportunity to carry on teaching their children to read and write, with the objective

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:50.850
of assisting them to become publishers.

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:55.769
Many parents responded to the encouragement, and this resulted in 37 young ones becoming

00:13:55.769 --> 00:13:58.570
proficient in reading and writing.

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:04.529
A sister named Sarah had been trying for some time to learn to read and write.

00:14:04.529 --> 00:14:10.610
At home, her husband tried to help her, but they just couldn't find enough time due to

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:14.649
their day-to-day activities and many responsibilities.

00:14:14.649 --> 00:14:21.169
Now when the pandemic limited their activities, her husband, who's an elder, took advantage

00:14:21.169 --> 00:14:23.450
of the extra time.

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:27.409
He began to help her several times a week to learn to read.

00:14:27.409 --> 00:14:33.210
Now she has the joy of reading the Bible and other publications on her own.

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:39.649
She also loves to sing the Kingdom songs using her own songbook.

00:14:39.649 --> 00:14:44.769
One Bible student named Comfort, earnestly long to be able to read the Bible.

00:14:44.769 --> 00:14:49.450
She became downhearted when the pandemic began and wondered who's going to help her read

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:52.809
now that she couldn't physically attend a literacy class.

00:14:52.809 --> 00:14:57.250
A local congregation elder gave her some excellent practical suggestions and he encouraged

00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:00.129
her to continue practicing on her own.

00:15:00.129 --> 00:15:04.090
With determination and persistence, Comfort applied the suggestions.

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:06.929
She made steady progress and she now reads well.

00:15:06.929 --> 00:15:09.210
She conducts five Bible studies.

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:13.330
She's also assisting her own 14-year-old daughter to learn how to read and write.

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:18.529
Comfort was baptized at the 2020 Always Rejoice Regional Convention.

00:15:18.529 --> 00:15:22.529
Maria is our 69-year-old sister in Nicaragua.

00:15:22.529 --> 00:15:25.730
She's been a regular pioneer for over six years.

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:30.210
She never had formal schooling and so she learned to read as she studied the Bible with

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:33.929
our sisters, but she didn't learn to write.

00:15:33.929 --> 00:15:39.009
When the pandemic started, Maria was very discouraged because she didn't know how to use

00:15:39.009 --> 00:15:43.409
her cell phone to preach and she didn't know how to write letters.

00:15:43.409 --> 00:15:46.129
But some of her fellow pioneers offered to help.

00:15:46.129 --> 00:15:51.169
So Maria would dictate her words to her field service partner who would then write the

00:15:51.169 --> 00:15:52.409
letter.

00:15:52.409 --> 00:15:57.250
Her field service partners would send Maria photographs of the letters they wrote in

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:58.730
her behalf.

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:05.129
And using the photographs, Maria then would copy them so as to write her own letters.

00:16:05.129 --> 00:16:08.889
This helped Maria to start developing writing skills.

00:16:08.889 --> 00:16:10.929
She now writes her own letters.

00:16:10.929 --> 00:16:16.769
If you could see the letters that she writes, what a neat handwriting she's learned to have

00:16:16.769 --> 00:16:21.330
and how well she expresses herself, obviously she's had Jehovah's blessing.

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:27.840
But it's certainly an encouragement to all of us to try to continue to improve.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:33.559
What a beautiful way to use our time during the pandemic.

00:16:33.559 --> 00:16:36.679
But let's not even for a minute.

00:16:36.679 --> 00:16:43.440
Make that literacy is an issue in only a few parts of the world, really.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:47.440
Literacy is an issue everywhere.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:53.440
And if we're being honest with ourselves, probably most of us would say that we could improve

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:57.080
in our reading and writing.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:02.159
So why not make the effort to do so?

00:17:02.159 --> 00:17:08.799
What would the governing body say in a recent letter to all branch committees?

00:17:08.799 --> 00:17:14.880
We want our brothers and sisters to progress spiritually and grow to maturity.

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:21.680
In large measure, this requires that they be able to read and study God's Word along

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.680
with our publications.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:31.920
Many of the ways in which we serve God involve the ability to read, for example, all

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:39.000
Christians have the weighty responsibility of teaching vital truths to others.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:45.039
And appointed men have many responsibilities that involve reading.

00:17:45.039 --> 00:17:50.559
In general, Christians should be able to read.

00:17:50.559 --> 00:17:55.759
So how could we learn to read or improve in our reading?

00:17:55.759 --> 00:17:58.400
Here are two ways.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:04.480
Take a friend, a family member, or someone in your congregation to help you.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:11.640
An excellent tool to assist is the apply yourself to reading and writing brochure.

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:15.839
It is available in 123 languages.

00:18:15.839 --> 00:18:21.279
Why not ask your congregation elders about how to obtain this brochure?

00:18:21.279 --> 00:18:27.279
If you already know the alphabet and you can recognize words, audio recordings of our

00:18:27.279 --> 00:18:30.079
literature may also help.

00:18:30.079 --> 00:18:36.480
As you listen to the recording, read along in the written publication.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:42.400
Work to imitate the pronunciation as you hear each word.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:50.359
Improving our reading and writing is a great way to use our time during the pandemic.

00:18:50.359 --> 00:18:56.559
You brothers and sisters have shown that you can thrive spiritually and build others up

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.519
during a time of adversity.

00:18:59.519 --> 00:19:03.960
You have made good use of your time.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:10.359
May all of us continue to do so by assisting in active ones and by improving our reading

00:19:10.359 --> 00:19:12.640
skills.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:19.359
Be assured that the governing body keeps all of you in our prayers.

00:19:19.359 --> 00:19:25.680
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.
