00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:12.939
In his letter to the Ephesians, the Apostle Paul used a suit of armor to illustrate the spiritual

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:18.350
protection needed by a servant of Jehovah.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:24.219
He may have been thinking of the armor worn by a Roman soldier.

00:00:24.219 --> 00:00:27.219
Paul first mentions a soldier's belt.

00:00:27.219 --> 00:00:35.619
He carried his sword and was distinguished by metal plates, buckles, and other decorations.

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:41.579
The breastplate consisted of overlapping horizontal strips of iron, bent to fit the soldiers

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.579
torso.

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:49.100
They were fastened with leather straps, metal hooks, and buckles.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.219
His upper body was also covered in strips of iron, a fastened to leather.

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.939
Although his movement was restricted by the heavy armor, the soldiers' vital organs

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:03.140
were protected.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.620
When marching into battle, a soldier wore durable, sandal-like boots.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:14.069
These were made by fastening three layers of leather together.

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:19.750
The soles were studded with metal nails to grip the ground.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.790
The large shield carried by a Roman Legionnaire was rectangular and covered in from his shoulders

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.469
to his knees.

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:36.290
The shield protected him from the blows of a weapon or airborne missiles.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.650
The helmet was an essential part of a soldier's military equipment.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:48.250
It was lined and padded for comfort, and had a chin strap to keep it tightly in place.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.049
The helmet's unique design warded off blows, directed at a soldier's head, neck, and

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.329
face.

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:05.030
The sword, it measured about 60 cm long.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.889
The blade was double edged.

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:14.050
At the base of the grip, the pommel prevented the sword from slipping out of the soldier's

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.050
hand.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.639
The shield soldiers practice with their weapons every day.

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:26.639
Each piece in the suit of armor played a vital role to protect the soldier in battle.
