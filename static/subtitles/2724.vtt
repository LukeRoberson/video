00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.400
But when I was younger, I didn't really think of Jehovah that much as a person.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.039
Well, I definitely think that having a friendship with God is a hard concept to understand.

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:10.480
I like the scripture that says,

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.400
Taste and see that Jehovah is good,

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.719
because if you want to get to know Jehovah as a friend and develop a relationship with him,

00:00:16.719 --> 00:00:21.359
you do have to put forth effort and you have to take the first step you could say.

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.519
You have to see Jehovah as a person and that he's real,

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:29.039
and that when you pray, you know he's hearing you.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.200
When I'm all alone, I take advantage of the opportunity to talk to him.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.560
I talk to him all the time.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.159
There is no greater feeling than having Jehovah as your friend and it's worth the effort.

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:44.399
Friends in your life come and go,

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.479
but the only person who will never truly leave you is Jehovah.

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:51.439
He can be your friend forever if you want him to be.

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:54.399
Our family went through some hard times having a single mom.

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:56.079
We didn't know where our next meal was coming from.

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.079
We would be able to pay the rent and that's the,

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.079
I think the biggest thing I learned in my life is to throw that anxiety upon Jehovah

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:04.799
and he'll take care of you in every single time without fail.

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:06.799
And he's come through for us.

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:08.640
My parents weren't in the truth.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.640
The only thing I had was Jehovah.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.280
So I had developed a real relationship with him.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.200
When I think of a friend, I think of somebody you desire to tell your feelings to,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.560
but you can always tell Jehovah anything.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.799
Through the good times and the bad, one way or another,

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.359
I've seen that he's always helped me to continue.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.920
Whenever I have a problem, whenever I'm down,

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.239
I always know that I can go to him any time that I want to for anything.
