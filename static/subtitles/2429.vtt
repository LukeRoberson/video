00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:26.339
He's like a miss that appears in a moment of time it's gone

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:35.030
And our love is like the warm summer sun

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:43.630
Let it shine on the ones we love while there's time

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:51.439
I could take it all, let time just slip away

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:55.979
And forget to love right now

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:05.390
I could put off till, so that I can do today

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:41.049
But I never doubt how much beauty you hold the love

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:44.049
That you hold the wish on

00:01:44.049 --> 00:03:32.599
Then I know, forget that I can do today

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.599
Cause I never want to
