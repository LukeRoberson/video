00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:07.330
My father was a patriotic man, and he passed away while in combat when I was only a year old.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:14.609
I decided that I wanted to do what he highly valued, so I decided to serve in the army.

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:23.609
However, when I began seriously studying the Bible, I cultivated a desire to please only Jehovah, which helped me to change my decision.

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.910
When I read Isaiah 2.4,

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:36.909
I understood that the person who wants to live a life pleasing to Jehovah will not learn combat and will not participate in wars.

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:47.630
My stand on neutrality was challenged when I became an adult and was required to serve in the army.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.630
But my Bible beliefs did not allow me to perform such service.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:59.630
That was why I was arrested and sentenced to two and a half years of imprisonment.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.630
In prison, prayers really helped me.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.629
I asked Jehovah many times to give me the power beyond what is normal so that I couldn't do it.

00:01:09.629 --> 00:01:17.629
And in order for me to receive the answers to my prayers, I regularly did personal study and Bible reading.

00:01:17.629 --> 00:01:20.629
The visits the elders made were very encouraging.

00:01:20.629 --> 00:01:24.629
At those times, I felt Jehovah's warm care.

00:01:24.629 --> 00:01:33.629
Jehovah has been my support through his organization, his word, the Holy Spirit, and also through his gifts and men.

00:01:33.629 --> 00:01:41.629
It is true that I suffered both physically and emotionally, but I never regretted the position I took.
