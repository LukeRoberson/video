00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.980
My mother taught me from a very young age to pray.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.980
For us, it meant chatting openly with our Heavenly Father.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.980
Every day conversation.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.969
That was a valuable life lesson that has empowered me throughout my life.

00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:27.859
Growing up, I always wanted to become a teacher.

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:30.859
But after reflecting on it a bit more,

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.859
I realized that what I really wanted to do with my life

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:37.859
was to work for the Kingdom of Heaven.

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:40.859
So, how could I do both?

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:44.859
I decided to pursue a career in theology.

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:47.859
My goal was to become an instructor in the church.

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:52.329
When I started working for the church,

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.329
I quickly discovered that the teachings of the church

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.759
contradict what the Bible says.

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:04.760
One question left unanswered by the church was,

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.760
why suffering exists?

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.760
A pastor could only stammer and say,

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.760
well, it can't be explained because it's a mystery.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.760
But I didn't think the existence of suffering

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.760
could be a mystery at all.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.519
I realized that I had to find a way

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:29.930
to satisfy my conscience

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.930
and still uphold the position of the church.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.930
So, while I was teaching, I would explain,

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.930
this is what the church teaches.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.930
But this is what the Bible says.

00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:59.379
And then, the most tragic moment of my life happened.

00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:02.379
I was 22 years old

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:04.379
and in the middle of planning for my wedding,

00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:13.060
when my fiance died in a car accident.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:21.449
Of course, this changed my life completely.

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:28.159
It was the most painful feeling.

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.159
I just knew deep down that now,

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.159
I would never marry or have a family of my own.

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:38.759
So, I had to find a way to survive,

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:41.759
day after day, year after year,

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:48.300
and look for another way to leave something meaningful behind.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.300
So, I buried myself in my work.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.469
The position at the church that I had been working toward

00:02:56.469 --> 00:03:01.469
was discontinued and changed to the role of a priest.

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:06.469
Altogether, I did congregational work for 33 years.

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:10.469
And then, when my health couldn't take it anymore,

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:13.469
I did other tasks for the church.

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:18.009
I was giving everything I had to give.

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:23.930
But whenever I looked to the church to give something to me,

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.930
I was always left empty.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.069
I prayed for many years.

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.069
Lord, help me find my real spiritual home.

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.069
This was my prayer for about 10 years.

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:46.469
And then one day, I came across Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:51.229
Immediately, I said to my Heavenly Father,

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:55.229
this is what I have been searching for.

00:03:55.229 --> 00:04:00.229
I found out that the Holy Spirit was coming to me.

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:03.229
I found out that the Holy Spirit was coming to me.

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:05.229
It was coming to me.

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:09.229
What do you have for me?

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:13.229
That was the first thing I asked them.

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:18.230
The first meeting I attended made a big impression on me.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.230
I remember, in particular, the verse in the Gospel of John,

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.230
by this, all will know that you are my disciples,

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.230
if you have love in your midst.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:33.230
And I thought, I've been searching for this all my life.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.230
And this is it.

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:42.970
It's right here.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.970
My closest friend was deeply shocked when I told her

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.970
that I was going to leave the church to become one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.970
When she calmed down, she said,

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.970
I will support you, as I always have,

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.970
but promise me you won't change.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.970
Four years later, she came to visit me again.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:12.970
She kept watching me closely and said,

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.970
you have changed.

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:22.279
I was startled and asked in what way?

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:32.089
She said, it looks to me like you're happy.

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:40.199
My prayer to find a spiritual home was answered.

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:47.199
And I experienced the great miracle of finally finding

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:52.199
what I had been looking for my entire life.
