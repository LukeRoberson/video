00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:12.679
I had a comfortable economic situation.

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:18.679
For 20 years, I worked as the supervisor of a firm contracted by the oil industry.

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:26.679
My family of five, made up of my wife, my three daughters and myself, never had to worry about food.

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:32.679
One afternoon, as I watched the news on television, I learned that the company I worked for

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:36.679
had come under new management.

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:43.679
That Monday, when I went to work, I arrived at my office and found the new supervisor sitting in my chair

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:47.679
that I had occupied for 20 years.

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:50.679
I saw my resume in his hand.

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:55.679
He congratulated me for being a hard worker who was honest and productive.

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:59.679
But he said there was just one thing missing.

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:03.679
I needed to join a political party.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.680
I replied as tactfully as I could, that my wife and I were Jehovah's Witnesses

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.680
and that we were neutral in political matters.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.680
The mood quickly deteriorated.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.680
Visibly angered, the supervisor's facial expression and tone of voice changed and he threatened me,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.680
saying that if I did not join the political party, that would be my last day at work.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.680
I did not sign it or join the political party because that would be like committing adultery

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.680
and keeping quiet about it.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.680
I would feel as if I had betrayed Jehovah.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:46.680
I could have signed and kept my old job, but I knew my conscience would bother me for the rest of my life.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:55.680
I would never be able to go to the congregation and serve as an elder, knowing that I had let Jehovah down.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.680
Suddenly, I was unemployed.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.680
I lost 20 years of work and the servants and seniority pay I was due.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.680
My wife and my daughters were waiting for me.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.680
And right then and there, we prayed together and asked Jehovah to please provide for us,

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.680
to please not let us be tempted beyond what we could bear.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.680
We knew we were facing a huge test,

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.990
but that we would prevail because we had been obedient to Jehovah.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.990
Since losing my job, I've done several different odd jobs like gardening and painting houses,

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.990
and at present I work with public transportation.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:41.990
My daughter, Kinesareth, the second oldest, paints pictures and we sell them.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.990
My wife makes food and homemade sweets, and we have learned other skills as well.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.990
We have greatly simplified our life.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:57.530
My wife and I were even invited to pioneer school in 2014.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.530
Our two older daughters auxiliary pioneer from time to time,

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.530
and our youngest daughter, who is 13, was baptized.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.530
Jehovah has never let us down.
