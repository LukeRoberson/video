WEBVTT

00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:06.929
Well, in Jesus' name we pray, amen, we say that all the time, and as Brother

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:11.470
Montenegro just pointed out, this is not just some technical thing like a

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.769
signature at the end of a letter that we send to Jehovah.

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:22.370
As we learned through the text today, our comments, this is a recognition of

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:27.809
Jesus' role as high priest and appreciation for the ransom that makes it

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:35.549
possible to open the way or our approach to Jehovah God. So when Jehovah sees

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:43.270
that gratitude and when our actions back up that attitude, well then he's going

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.630
to listen to our prayers. But we have maybe a few other questions that we might

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:55.950
have based on this scripture, John chapter 14 verses 13 and 14. The scripture

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.890
says in verse 13, whatever you ask in my name, which we now understand, Jesus

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:10.370
says, I will do this. And then you notice in verse 14, he says it again. If you

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:21.560
ask anything in my name, I will do it. So here's the question. Is Jesus

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.180
answering our prayers? Is that what he means? Well, notice what Jesus says in

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.620
the same conversation, but just a little later, in John chapter 16 and verse 23.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:39.500
You can open your Bibles there to John chapter 16 and verse 23. We'll just

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:49.739
read the second half of that verse. It says, most truly I say to you, if you

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:58.700
ask the Father for anything, he will give it to you in my name. Now does this

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.140
seem like a contradiction? Didn't Jesus say, if you ask anything in my name, I

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:11.539
will do it. And now Jesus is saying, if you ask anything in my name, he will give

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:18.319
it to you. Jehovah will give it to you. So what's the answer? What's going on? Well,

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.659
let's get a balance this idea out just a little bit further in Jesus

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:31.979
conversation in verses 26 and 27. Jesus continues saying to his disciples, in

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:41.219
that day, you will make requests of the Father in my name. In saying this, I do not

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:48.620
mean that I will make requests for you, for the Father Himself has affection for

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:56.900
you. So who is it that's working in our behalf when we pray? Well, notice what

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.740
the watchtower of April 2020 says to explain this verse. It says, although

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:11.020
Jehovah is the one who hears and answers our prayers, he has given Jesus the

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:21.300
authority to carry out his decisions. So Jehovah listens, he then decides on a

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:29.099
plan, a way of responding to the prayer, and Jehovah follows through by using

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:35.860
Jesus to provide the Holy Spirit that we need in answer to our prayer. Amazing. And

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.819
neither of them are pressured to do this. They do this because of love. Jesus says

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:48.659
this at the end of verse 27, chapter 16, 27, the Father Himself has affection for

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:53.939
you. So they don't feel obligated. The study note on that verse, the idea of

00:03:53.939 --> 00:04:01.500
affection says that it's the same deep emotion or affection that Jesus showed when

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.979
he saw his friends Mary and Martha grieving the death of Lazarus, their brother,

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:15.060
and also Jesus' friend. So Jehovah and Jesus motivated by affection and love are

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:22.779
working toward responding to our prayers. So can you imagine the power that that

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:29.060
means for us? Jehovah and Jesus interested in our thoughts, interested in our

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:36.660
concerns and working towards answering and helping us. So that's with one

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:47.779
prayer. What happens when those prayers are multiplied in a large group? Well, in

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:54.579
second Corinthians, chapter 1 and verse 11, Paul wrote this, he was that he was

00:04:54.579 --> 00:04:59.819
talking about the prayers that the congregation in Corinth would say for him. He

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:07.660
says, you also can help us by your supplication for us in order that many may

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:13.500
give things in our behalf for the for the favor we receive in answer to the

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:23.699
prayers of many. So one prayer has power, but a united prayer in behalf of

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:32.540
someone or a group of people has more power. This is what the inside book says on

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:39.540
this verse, while Jehovah God cannot be pressured by numbers into acting, he

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:47.180
evidently takes action when his servants collectively show deep concern and

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:54.420
united interest. So let's see that in practice through a Bible example. How

00:05:54.420 --> 00:06:01.060
Jehovah listens and responds by using Jesus to the united prayers of his

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:06.180
servants. It's a famous example in Acts chapter 12. So open your Bibles, please

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:16.500
there to Acts chapter 12, and we see in verses 1 and 2 the situation here I just

00:06:17.019 --> 00:06:23.579
is mistreating the congregation. He puts James the Apostle in prison and then he

00:06:23.579 --> 00:06:30.180
executes James, executes an Apostle. You can just imagine how this is affecting

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:35.180
the brothers, how this is affecting the other Apostles. And then what does he do

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:45.579
next? Well, in verses 3 and 4, he then arrests Peter. He puts him into prison. He

00:06:45.579 --> 00:06:49.980
had Peter chained between two guards. This is what the Bering thorough witness

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:55.740
book says, chained between two guards at a time, sixteen in total, working in

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:01.540
shifts day and night to make sure that this Apostle didn't escape like the

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:08.980
Apostles escaped before in Acts chapter 5. What was Herod wanting to do with

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:15.779
Peter? He wanted to execute Peter. So can you imagine the stress that Peter

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:21.060
would have had that night? Remember, Peter is a married man. Who's going to take

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:26.980
care of my wife? Who's going to take care of the congregation? Who's going to

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:33.819
feed Jesus' little sheep? Jesus told him, this is what I want you to do. So all

00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:38.939
of these things were probably on his mind and he was praying about it. But now

00:07:38.939 --> 00:07:45.019
how could the congregation help Peter? Well, they knew exactly what to do. Verse 5

00:07:45.019 --> 00:07:54.060
says, so Peter was being kept in the prison, but the congregation was intensely

00:07:54.060 --> 00:08:04.050
praying to God, of course, in Jesus' name, for him, for Peter. So how did this

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:11.009
collective prayer move Jehovah to use Jesus and following through in helping

00:08:11.009 --> 00:08:20.100
Peter? Verse 6 and 7. When Herod was about to bring him out that night, Peter

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:29.300
was sleeping bound with two chains between two soldiers and guards in front of

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:35.019
the door were keeping watch over the prison. But look, Jehovah's angel was

00:08:35.019 --> 00:08:40.779
standing there and a light shown in the prison cell. Hitting Peter on the

00:08:40.779 --> 00:08:50.220
side, he woke him, saying, get up quickly and the chains fell off his hands. So how

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:57.860
did Jehovah respond in using Jesus? Well, they sent an angel that was used to

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:03.940
free Peter. But do you notice the details of this verse? Jehovah also understood

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:11.179
Peter's needs until Peter's situation would change. It says here that in

00:09:11.179 --> 00:09:19.139
verse 6 that he was sleeping. How soundly? Well, do you remember how soundly

00:09:19.139 --> 00:09:23.779
you were sleeping when you were a little kid and your mom would come in to wake

00:09:23.779 --> 00:09:28.299
you up? She'd turn on the light. She might give you a little nudge on the side

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:33.820
and tell you to get up. Why? Because you were sleeping soundly. And that's

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:39.220
exactly what the angel did. He shone the light on Peter. Peter still didn't wake

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:47.340
up. He then began hitting Peter, of course, lovingly on his side and had to

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:52.500
tell him to get up quickly. And it seems that Peter was so groggy that even

00:09:52.500 --> 00:10:02.139
later on, he didn't really quite understand what was going on. So what's the

00:10:02.139 --> 00:10:08.340
point? He received the peace of God that surpasses all understanding and tell

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.259
the situation changed.
