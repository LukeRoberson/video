WEBVTT

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:06.240
We don't know her name, but we know her husband.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.300
He was a hard-working fisherman, outspoken apostle, writer of two Bible books, and the only

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:22.219
person besides Jesus to walk on water, we know Peter, that sometimes we forget his wife.

00:00:22.219 --> 00:00:24.820
What was Peter's wife like?

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.660
What were they like as a married couple?

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.699
And what can they teach you 24 married couples?

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:38.340
This is the first time and close to a decade we've had an entire class of only married couples.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:46.020
Thus we've chosen Peter and his wife so that you can learn specific lessons, that you

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.700
can bring to your places of assignment, but especially to strengthen your marriages as

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.780
you apply this and you serve together side by side.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:09.180
Let's begin by reading Mark chapter 1, Mark chapter 1, verse 16.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.739
While walking alongside the sea of Galilee, he saw a Simon, that's Jesus saw Simon and

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:21.260
Simon's brother Andrew casting their nets into the sea for they were fishermen.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.379
Peter's a fisherman.

00:01:23.379 --> 00:01:25.540
He brings home the fish.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.739
His wife cooks the fish.

00:01:27.739 --> 00:01:33.099
And if she doesn't cook the fish, she sells the fish, like a capable proverbs 31 wife

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:36.659
brings home the money that helps support the house.

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.980
It allows Peter to handle his responsibilities all as well.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.019
A great couple working side by side together.

00:01:46.019 --> 00:01:53.980
However, life changes suddenly, verse 17 and 18.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.019
So Jesus said to them, come after me and I will make you fishers of men.

00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:04.340
And at once they abandoned their nets and followed him.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.500
In faith, Peter abandons his fishing business and follows Jesus.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.740
What did she think about that?

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.780
Did she expect that?

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.099
Did she become insecure and uncertain now about the future?

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:25.539
Which he feel that her life now has been upended by the decisions of her impulsive,

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:30.419
big-hearted husband, Peter, what are you doing?

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:38.340
We have very good reason to conclude that Peter's wife supported the decision and willing

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:47.659
to and ready to stand right at Peter's side as he took on added responsibilities.

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:56.139
Let's gain more insight into the life of Peter and his wife with verse 29.

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:02.620
At that they left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon and Andrew with James and

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.819
John.

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:11.860
While this verse explains that they went to the home of Simon and Andrew, they lived together.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:18.300
So Peter's wife was agreeable to sharing her living space with Andrew.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:28.259
His brother and likely the close friends of Peter, James and John, were frequent guests.

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:32.219
And you can hear Peter saying, come over anytime.

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:35.300
And his wife does the cooking.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.620
That's the way it would work.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.740
She could most likely hear the sons of thunder coming.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.580
Here they come.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.860
And Peter says, that's them.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.539
Not more fish.

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:52.900
That's the way it probably would be.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.259
But here's the question, why could Peter feel free to bring his friends home?

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:09.439
And sometimes most likely they came in an unexpected manner because he knew his wife.

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:15.479
And interestingly when he wrote his first letter, he advised husbands to dwell with their

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:19.600
wives according to knowledge.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.720
Peter knew his wife.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:30.639
And he knew that she would be willing to accommodate the guests because she knew her husband.

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.040
That's Peter.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.910
Come on over.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.629
She and Peter were a team.

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:42.029
She knew that having them in the home involved some inconvenience.

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:44.350
Maybe we get that.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:50.550
But think of the conversations that she would be privy to as Peter and you, James, John

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.310
would discuss Jesus' ministry.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.910
She would sit there, oh my, I'm so glad they came.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.509
The blessing that she would get as they talked about Jesus' ministry.

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:03.589
So here's your first big lesson.

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:07.790
Something very similar can happen to you as a couple.

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.750
Your husband's good shepherding.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:18.430
No result in warm conversations and strong friendships are forged.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:27.870
And that could lead to spontaneous invitations like, say, come on over for a snack and you

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.790
get a text, guess who's coming to dinner.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.230
But is it inconvenient at times?

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.230
Yes.

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.550
But there is a Bible principle.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.310
And the Bible principle here overrides all cultures past and present.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.069
Be self-sacrificing and hospitable.

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:51.189
So be like Peter and his wife.

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:56.550
And think of the spiritual blessings you would receive as you get to know your brothers

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:03.910
and sisters better, that overrides even the inconvenience.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:09.470
But the self-sacrificing spirit of this dynamic couple doesn't stop there.

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.029
Let's read verse 30.

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:18.389
Now Simon's mother-in-law was lying down sick with a fever and they at once told her about

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:22.269
they once told him, Jesus, about her.

00:06:22.269 --> 00:06:26.949
So now we learn that Peter and his wife are caring for a parent.

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:28.949
And at this moment she is sick.

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:34.110
And what demands that place is on a married couple, you know that.

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.589
And for a sick parent.

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:41.470
And for a married couple to live with one in law, naturally has its challenges.

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:49.990
But living with a brother-in-law and a mother-in-law, now that brings it to an entirely new level.

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:57.949
Can you hear Peter's wife whispering to Peter, your brother Andrew is driving me crazy.

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:01.670
And Peter being tempted to blurt out, but what about your mother?

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:02.670
No.

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:07.389
We're not saying that ever happened.

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:18.230
Nevertheless, we know that living with in-laws and caring for aging parents poses unique challenges for a couple.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.829
That would require great sacrifices.

00:07:20.829 --> 00:07:23.389
That's what we're talking about.

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:27.870
However, with sacrifices comes blessings.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:33.709
Just as we've discussed over and over in class with a sacrifice comes a blessing.

00:07:33.709 --> 00:07:35.870
Verse 31.

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:39.069
Jesus performs a miracle right in the home.

00:07:39.069 --> 00:07:40.389
Mom is cured.

00:07:40.389 --> 00:07:42.029
Imagine that.

00:07:42.029 --> 00:07:42.990
Mom is cured.

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:47.629
What a tender intimate moment this must have been for Peter and his wife.

00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:48.470
Thank Jehovah.

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:52.670
They probably said it heartfelt prayer thanking Jehovah.

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:57.310
Intimate, quiet, prayerful.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.350
But look what happens next.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:02.910
Verse 32 and 33.

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:09.389
After evening had fallen, when the sun had set, the people began bringing to him all who were ill and demon possessed.

00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:13.949
And the whole city was gathered right at the door.

00:08:13.949 --> 00:08:15.990
Where's the intimacy now?

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:18.509
It went from quiet to chaos.

00:08:18.509 --> 00:08:21.829
Imagine the scene, sick people from all over.

00:08:21.829 --> 00:08:24.189
Come to Peter's house to get healed.

00:08:24.189 --> 00:08:31.639
How would you feel if a whole city of sick and demon possessed people showed up at your door?

00:08:31.639 --> 00:08:40.399
Talk about uninvited guests and Peter's wife didn't have time to prepare and plan and make the house a perfect and not yet the table's not right.

00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:41.360
The chairs aren't right.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.039
No, that wasn't it.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:45.120
Things weren't perfect.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:49.159
And what if a crowd that size damaged the home?

00:08:49.159 --> 00:09:00.210
Like the desperate Jews who on a later occasion made a hole in someone's roof to drop down someone so that they could be healed?

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:04.210
At this point, Peter's wife certainly could have complained.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.409
Get these people out of here.

00:09:06.409 --> 00:09:11.059
But there is no record of a complaint.

00:09:11.059 --> 00:09:12.700
Consider this.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:20.100
Years later, when Peter counseled wives to cultivate the quiet and mild spirit,

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:27.019
did his wife's example give him the freedom of speech to offer that advice?

00:09:27.059 --> 00:09:39.299
And Peter must have thanked his wife, thanked her for her loyally being by his side as they supported Jesus' ministry.

00:09:39.299 --> 00:09:41.779
Another big lesson for you.

00:09:41.779 --> 00:09:50.980
As you deal with aging parents and health issues, look for Jehovah's blessing and enjoy your periods of calm.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:55.860
However, remember that we are living at a time when the scene of the world is changing.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.580
And it can change quickly.

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:02.860
A natural disaster, civil unrest, can break out unexpectedly.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:06.100
And you might have to accommodate those seeking aid.

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:10.059
And though you might not be ready for that, things aren't perfect.

00:10:10.059 --> 00:10:12.779
Don't worry about that.

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:18.179
But allow yourself sacrificing spirit to just move forward,

00:10:18.179 --> 00:10:28.500
going the extra mile, and husbands don't forget to thank your wife for being by your side

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:34.820
as you respond to the needs of the organization.

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:42.259
First Corinthians chapter 9 and verse 5 indicates that Peter's wife traveled with him for at least some of the time.

00:10:42.259 --> 00:10:48.740
Traveling with Peter would have included hard trips, dangerous conditions.

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:53.740
Peter was arrested in Jerusalem one time, two times, three times arrested again, flawed.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:56.100
This time James was arrested with him.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.700
James is beheaded.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:02.179
Would Peter's wife say, well, I see my husband again?

00:11:02.179 --> 00:11:10.769
It could not have been easy to be married to a man so involved in sacred service.

00:11:10.769 --> 00:11:18.570
Between the year 62 and 64, we find Peter who is now perhaps in his 60s,

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:26.409
serving with the need is greater in Babylon, where Jehovah inspired him to write two letters.

00:11:26.409 --> 00:11:34.009
As he is finishing his second letter and what now would become the twilight of his life,

00:11:34.009 --> 00:11:47.509
how thankful he must have been to have had such a faithful, loving, loyal wife by his side over the years.

00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:51.350
All things considered, here's the gold.

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:53.990
Work on selflessly as a team.

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:58.710
Be positive when confronted with unexpected challenges.

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:04.909
And husbands highly value the loyal support of your wife and thank her.

00:12:04.909 --> 00:12:16.230
Wives realize that after Jehovah in Jesus, you are probably the closest person that can work intimately with your husband for his success.

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:18.389
And of course, your own.

00:12:18.389 --> 00:12:28.470
And for you 24 dear couples, be determined to maintain your stride as you serve together side by side.
