00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:07.419
Our theme for this month's program is you are precious to Jehovah.

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:11.419
How vital it is that we remind ourselves of that.

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:16.420
Why? Well, let's consider three reasons.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.420
First, Satan wants us to believe that Jehovah doesn't love us or value our service.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.420
He wanted Job to believe that.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.420
But that was a lie in Job's day, and it's still a lie today.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.420
A second reason that we need to be reminded that we're precious to Jehovah

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.420
is because of negative circumstances or events that have taken place in our life.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:49.420
Severe illness, advancing years, injustices, mistreatment, a difficult family life,

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:56.420
or other situations may cause some brothers and sisters to feel that they're just not worth loving.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.420
Some may question why Jehovah allows those things to happen.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.420
Finally, we need reminders of how Jehovah feels about us

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.420
because our imperfection can cause us to have negative thoughts.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.420
Some may still punish themselves for past mistakes,

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.420
doubting that Jehovah has forgiven them, or that he could ever love them.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.420
Others wage a constant battle against feelings of worthlessness.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.420
One witness wrote,

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:35.420
Satan has done an excellent job of making even those who loved Jehovah feel worthless and unlovable.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.420
I never felt worthy of Jehovah's love,

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.420
so I tried to do more and more in his service as a way of earning that love.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.420
So no matter how many hours I spent in the ministry,

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.420
or how many people I helped, I felt it was not enough.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.420
I saw only the lack in me.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.420
One brother stated,

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.420
I came from a family that showed little love.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.420
I was belittled, teased, and laughed at.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.419
So early in life, I felt worthless.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:15.419
I still carry entrenched feelings from my past that beat me down when I experienced calamity.

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:18.419
When I stopped serving as a congregation elder,

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:21.419
I felt like a failure as usual.

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:28.060
To God, my family, and my brothers in the congregation.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.060
If you've experienced such feelings, you're not alone.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.060
So how can you be assured of Jehovah's interest?

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.060
Let's examine three lines of evidence that prove your precious to Jehovah.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.060
First, we'll examine Jehovah's feelings for the nation of Israel.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.060
Second, we'll reflect on an event recorded in the Gospels.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.060
And third, we'll consider a modern-day example of one who was very precious to God.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.909
By the end of the 16th century BCE,

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.909
millions of Israelites were enslaved in Egypt,

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:08.909
where they were severely oppressed.

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:12.909
In their distress, the Israelites cried out to Jehovah.

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:14.909
How did he feel?

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:19.909
Turn with me to Isaiah chapter 63 verse 9.

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:26.909
During all their distress, it was distressing to him.

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:28.909
Did you notice?

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:31.909
Not only did Jehovah see their troubles,

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:33.909
he felt for his people,

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:37.909
and he was moved to act in their behalf.

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:41.909
Isaiah chapter 63 verse 9 goes on to say,

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:46.909
in his love and compassion, he repurchased them.

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:50.909
Jehovah couldn't see their suffering or hear their outcries

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:55.909
without feeling for them and doing something about it.

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:00.909
That may remind us of the loving concern that a mother has for her newborn child.

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:03.909
When that baby cries, the mother takes notice,

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:05.909
and she feels for her child.

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:12.909
In fact, notice how this is expressed at Isaiah chapter 49 verse 15.

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:14.909
It reads,

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:17.910
can a woman forget her nursing child,

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.910
or have no compassion for the son of her womb?

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.910
Even if these women forget,

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.910
I would never forget you.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.910
It's hard to imagine a mother forgetting to nourish

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.910
and care for her nursing child.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.910
That baby is helpless.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.910
Day and night it needs its mother's attention.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.910
Sad to say, however,

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.910
we hear at times of such maternal neglect.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.910
But what did Jehovah say to reassure the Israelites?

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.910
I would never forget you.

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.910
Yes, the tender compassion that Jehovah felt for his servants

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.910
was immeasurably stronger than one of the most tender

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.910
and natural feelings we can imagine.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:08.379
The compassion a mother normally feels for her baby.

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:10.379
Jehovah's feelings for the Israelites

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:13.379
are summed up in another expression in the book of Isaiah.

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:18.379
Please read with me Isaiah chapter 43 verse 4.

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:22.379
For you became precious in my eyes.

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:27.379
You were honored and I have loved you.

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:31.379
Jehovah clearly expressed his feelings for his people.

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:34.730
As one of Jehovah's servants,

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.730
you can be sure that he also loves you most tenderly.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.730
No matter what trials you're facing now

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.730
or have endured in the past,

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.730
Jehovah sees you and he feels for you.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.730
When you hurt, he hurts.

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:55.730
You are far too precious to Jehovah for him to forget you.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.730
He remembers your past efforts

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:02.730
and he sees your continuing efforts to please him.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.730
Notice how Jehovah promises to sustain and comfort his people

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:12.730
according to Isaiah chapter 66 verses 12 and 13.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.730
You will nurse and be carried on the hip

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.730
and you will be bounced on the knees.

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.730
As a mother comforts her son,

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:25.730
so I will keep comforting you.

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.730
What a heartwarming scene.

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:30.730
Imagine a loving mother carrying a baby on her hip

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:34.730
or bouncing him on her knees.

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:36.730
In this way,

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.730
Jehovah touchingly illustrates the intensity

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:42.730
and tenderness of his love for you.

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:45.730
Just as Jehovah loved his people Israel,

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:50.730
he likewise feels that you are very precious and dear.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:54.550
Never doubt that.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.550
A second example of how Jehovah feels about his faithful servants

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.550
can be found in the gospels.

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.550
Let's read what happened on one occasion

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.550
when Jesus was at the temple in Jerusalem

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:09.550
at Luke chapter 21 verses 1 through 4.

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.550
Now as he looked up,

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:15.550
he saw the rich dropping their gifts into the treasury chests.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.550
Then he saw a needy widow

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:21.550
drop in two small coins,

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.550
a very little value.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.550
And he said,

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.550
truly I say to you that this poor widow

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.550
put in more than they all did.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.550
For all of these put in gifts out of their surplus,

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:37.550
but she, out of her want,

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:39.550
or as the footnote says,

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:45.550
poverty put in all the means of living she had.

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.550
The study note for verse 2

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.550
in the New World translation of the Holy Scriptures

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:52.550
tells us that the Greek word for needy

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:56.550
may describe a person who lacks the basic necessities of life

00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:00.550
or someone for whom life is a great struggle.

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:02.550
In the Christian Greek Scriptures,

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:05.550
it is used only here.

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:08.550
Just think about the widow's circumstances.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:12.550
Not only had she experienced the grief of losing her husband,

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:13.550
her provider,

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:17.550
but she also lived in a religious climate dominated by leaders

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:21.550
who, according to Luke chapter 20 verse 47,

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:24.550
would devour the houses of the widows

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:27.550
rather than help such vulnerable ones.

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:31.550
That widow was so poor that her contribution to the temple

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:35.549
was what a labor might earn in just a few minutes.

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:38.549
Life wasn't easy for her.

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:45.549
In fact, Jesus said that she put in all the means of living she had.

00:08:45.549 --> 00:08:48.549
Our publications have stated that the coins

00:08:48.549 --> 00:08:52.549
the widow contributed were likely too lepta.

00:08:53.549 --> 00:08:57.549
With eight lepta, a person could buy two sparrows

00:08:57.549 --> 00:09:01.549
which were among the cheapest birds used for food.

00:09:01.549 --> 00:09:07.549
So the widow had only half the amount needed to buy one sparo,

00:09:07.549 --> 00:09:09.549
hardly enough for a single meal,

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:15.549
yet both the widow and her contribution were valuable to Jehovah.

00:09:15.549 --> 00:09:21.549
Jesus said that her contribution was greater than the contributions of the rich.

00:09:21.549 --> 00:09:25.549
When she put those two small coins in the treasury chest,

00:09:25.549 --> 00:09:28.549
they would be mixed with what the rich had put in.

00:09:28.549 --> 00:09:32.549
To imperfect human eyes, they might seem lost, buried.

00:09:32.549 --> 00:09:37.549
Yet this precious widow was the one Jesus singled out for praise.

00:09:37.549 --> 00:09:40.549
When the treasury workers came across the coins,

00:09:40.549 --> 00:09:45.549
they wouldn't have known how precious the coins and their donor were to Jehovah.

00:09:45.549 --> 00:09:48.549
But God's view was the one that really mattered.

00:09:48.549 --> 00:09:54.549
Not what other people thought, or even how that dear widow viewed herself.

00:09:54.549 --> 00:10:01.549
Like that widow, you may find that circumstances limit what you can contribute to Jehovah.

00:10:01.549 --> 00:10:06.549
Age, infirmities, or other circumstances beyond your control

00:10:06.549 --> 00:10:10.549
may limit the amount of time you're able to spend in the ministry.

00:10:10.549 --> 00:10:17.549
You might feel that your efforts are like those two small coins, a very little value.

00:10:17.549 --> 00:10:22.549
Still, we learn from this account of the needy widow that Jehovah notices

00:10:22.549 --> 00:10:26.549
and he treasures each act done for him,

00:10:26.549 --> 00:10:31.549
especially when we do it despite difficult circumstances.

00:10:31.549 --> 00:10:37.549
For a moment, think back on your worship of Jehovah during the past year.

00:10:37.549 --> 00:10:40.549
Some of you may feel that you accomplished little.

00:10:40.549 --> 00:10:46.549
Your imperfect heart might cause you to wonder whether Jehovah was pleased with your efforts.

00:10:46.549 --> 00:10:53.549
However, did one of the hours you spent require a special sacrifice on your part?

00:10:53.549 --> 00:11:00.549
If Jehovah took notice of the widow dropping in those two coins and valued her contribution,

00:11:00.549 --> 00:11:07.549
don't you think he also noticed and values what you did for him during that hour?

00:11:07.549 --> 00:11:14.549
Jehovah values every gift no matter how small that springs from a heart motivated by love.

00:11:14.549 --> 00:11:21.549
He remembers and he'll reward even the smallest contribution given in support of his kingdom.

00:11:21.549 --> 00:11:25.549
That's proof of how Jehovah feels about you.

00:11:25.549 --> 00:11:33.759
Finally, let's consider a modern-day example of one who was very precious to Jehovah.

00:11:33.759 --> 00:11:37.759
It's the experience of Sister Aretti Pina.

00:11:37.759 --> 00:11:42.759
Sister Pina lived on the southern coast of Albania in the town of Vlor.

00:11:42.759 --> 00:11:46.759
She was baptized in 1928 at the age of 18.

00:11:46.759 --> 00:11:50.759
There was a strong congregation in Vlor in the 1930s,

00:11:50.759 --> 00:11:59.759
and Sister Pina was a zealous evangelizer who climbed up and down rugged mountains preaching with her Bible in hand.

00:11:59.759 --> 00:12:06.759
In time, a congregation no longer existed in Vlor, and Sister Pina lost contact with the brothers.

00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:10.759
Yet, she kept preaching faithfully on her own.

00:12:10.759 --> 00:12:13.759
Do you think her efforts went unnoticed by Jehovah?

00:12:13.759 --> 00:12:22.759
Well, years later, word reached the brothers that there was an old senile woman who was reportedly preaching in Vlor.

00:12:22.759 --> 00:12:28.759
People thought she was crazy for keeping faith in God during years of totalitarian rule.

00:12:28.759 --> 00:12:34.759
Yet, Sister Pina, now in her 80s, was anything but senile.

00:12:34.759 --> 00:12:39.759
When the brothers arrived at her home, Sister Pina invited them in.

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:42.759
But she seemed somewhat reserved.

00:12:42.759 --> 00:12:48.759
When they explained that they were her spiritual brothers, she had no reaction.

00:12:48.759 --> 00:12:53.759
After a few minutes, Sister Pina started firing questions at the brothers.

00:12:53.759 --> 00:12:55.759
Do you believe in the Trinity?

00:12:55.759 --> 00:12:58.759
What is God's name? Do you believe in hellfire?

00:12:58.759 --> 00:13:00.759
What happens when we die?

00:13:00.759 --> 00:13:03.759
What about the earth? How many go to heaven?

00:13:04.759 --> 00:13:06.759
The brothers answered each question.

00:13:06.759 --> 00:13:09.759
Do you preach? She then asked.

00:13:09.759 --> 00:13:12.759
Yes, said one brother. We preach.

00:13:12.759 --> 00:13:16.759
But she responded. How do you preach?

00:13:16.759 --> 00:13:20.759
We preach from house to house, replied the brother.

00:13:20.759 --> 00:13:25.759
Now I know that you are my brothers, she exclaimed.

00:13:25.759 --> 00:13:29.759
Only Jehovah's people preach from house to house.

00:13:29.759 --> 00:13:32.759
Through her tears, Sister Pina stated,

00:13:32.759 --> 00:13:35.759
Jehovah is wonderful.

00:13:35.759 --> 00:13:37.759
He never forgot me.

00:13:37.759 --> 00:13:43.419
Sometime later, the brothers were notified that Sister Pina was ill

00:13:43.419 --> 00:13:47.419
and that she wanted to meet with one of the responsible brothers.

00:13:47.419 --> 00:13:52.419
When he arrived, she asked in part, as she gasped for air,

00:13:52.419 --> 00:13:56.419
has the book of revelation been fulfilled?

00:13:57.419 --> 00:13:59.419
The brother responded.

00:13:59.419 --> 00:14:02.419
Yes, Arati. Most of it has.

00:14:02.419 --> 00:14:04.419
Sister Pina said,

00:14:04.419 --> 00:14:06.419
Now I can die in peace.

00:14:06.419 --> 00:14:10.419
I needed to know how close we are.

00:14:10.419 --> 00:14:16.419
Shortly after that conversation, Sister Pina faithfully finished her earthly course.

00:14:16.419 --> 00:14:19.669
What do you think?

00:14:19.669 --> 00:14:24.669
During all those years of isolation from the earthly part of Jehovah's organization,

00:14:24.669 --> 00:14:28.669
did Sister Pina's efforts go unnoticed by Jehovah?

00:14:28.669 --> 00:14:31.669
Absolutely not.

00:14:31.669 --> 00:14:38.669
Just imagine Jehovah's joy as he watched her faithfully doing what she could in his service.

00:14:38.669 --> 00:14:42.669
Do you think that Sister Pina was precious to Jehovah?

00:14:42.669 --> 00:14:45.669
Without a doubt she was.

00:14:45.669 --> 00:14:50.669
Well, your efforts in Jehovah's service do not go unnoticed by him either.

00:14:51.669 --> 00:14:57.529
Like Sister Pina, you are precious to him.

00:14:57.529 --> 00:15:01.529
So what does this consideration help us to realize?

00:15:01.529 --> 00:15:06.529
We may have to contend with Satan's lies, negative circumstances and events in our lives,

00:15:06.529 --> 00:15:09.529
and our own imperfections.

00:15:09.529 --> 00:15:15.529
But we should never forget that Jehovah highly values his servants.

00:15:15.529 --> 00:15:19.529
We saw that in his words to the Israelites through the prophet Isaiah.

00:15:19.529 --> 00:15:24.529
You can be sure that Jehovah loves you most tenderly.

00:15:24.529 --> 00:15:28.529
No matter what trials you're facing now or have endured in the past,

00:15:28.529 --> 00:15:32.529
Jehovah sees you and he feels for you.

00:15:32.529 --> 00:15:35.529
When you hurt, he hurts.

00:15:35.529 --> 00:15:42.029
You're far too precious to Jehovah for him to forget you.

00:15:42.029 --> 00:15:45.029
The account of the widow at Luke chapter 21 can assure you

00:15:45.029 --> 00:15:50.029
that all those circumstances may affect what you can contribute to Jehovah.

00:15:50.029 --> 00:15:55.029
He notices and treasures each act you do for him,

00:15:55.029 --> 00:15:59.029
especially when you do it in the face of difficult circumstances.

00:15:59.029 --> 00:16:07.029
He remembers and he will reward even the smallest contribution given in support of his kingdom.

00:16:07.029 --> 00:16:11.029
And what beautiful modern day examples we have in the organization

00:16:11.029 --> 00:16:15.029
of brothers and sisters who have proven their loyalty to Jehovah

00:16:15.029 --> 00:16:17.029
and are precious to him.

00:16:17.029 --> 00:16:20.029
Like the example of Sister Pena.

00:16:20.029 --> 00:16:28.029
Dear brothers and sisters, please never forget that you are precious to Jehovah.
