00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:07.679
Our text this morning is so encouraging and so strengthening for us.

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:15.400
It reminds us of a special type of peace that we can experience that's not dependent on

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.920
our circumstances or on what's going on around us.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:27.239
How would you define that peace of God that's referred to in our text?

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:29.440
What exactly is it?

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:35.780
Now Insight Volume 2, page 592, says this.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:43.299
The peace of God, that is the calmness and tranquility that result from a Christian's

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:50.320
precious relationship with Jehovah God, guards his heart and mental powers from becoming

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.539
anxious about his needs.

00:00:53.539 --> 00:01:01.500
He has the assurance that Jehovah God provides for his servants and answers their prayers.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.819
This puts his heart and mind at rest.

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:09.659
So now what do you understand from that definition?

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.859
When if you look at Philippians chapter 4 and look at verses 6 and 7 together, we understand

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:23.780
from those verses that when we pour out our heart to Jehovah, when we supplicate him,

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:31.180
when we beg him for his help, and when we do so with a thankful spirit, always being

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.900
grateful for the good things that Jehovah gives us, being confident that he will bless us

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:44.180
and he will help us, we can receive from Jehovah that wonderful calmness and tranquility

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.500
that puts our minds and hearts to rest.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:57.180
Now as Paul goes on to say there in verse 7, that peace of God surpasses all understanding.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.700
Now let's look at some examples, first of all in the scriptures, where we see individuals

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.939
who experience that peace of God.

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:13.080
Now first of all, let's go to Daniel chapter 3, Daniel chapter 3, and let's go down

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.919
here at verse 16.

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:20.159
And of course, now this is the account of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:25.240
And you'll remember the situation, Nebuchadnezzar had erected this image and required everyone

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.919
to bow down before it.

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:32.400
And when it became evident that the Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego would not do this,

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.960
they were brought before the king.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.439
Here's what they said.

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:41.960
Look at verse 16, Oh Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.319
If it must be, our God whom we serve is able to rescue us from the burning fiery furnace

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.879
okay, and to rescue us from your hand.

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:58.159
But even if he does not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:03.199
or worship the image of gold that you have set up.

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:09.000
Well now the Bible doesn't record the prayer that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego said.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
But when you listen to their words, do you hear their calm?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.919
Do you hear the tranquility in their voices?

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:18.759
There's no panic here.

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:20.439
There's no terror.

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:26.039
They speak confidently and calmly with full trust in Jehovah.

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:33.639
Well as you look on to verse 19, you'll see that Nebuchadnezzar becomes furious at this.

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:38.039
And he has the furnace heated seven times hotter than normal.

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:45.759
This 22 says that when the king's command was so harsh and the furnace was so hot that

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:51.199
the men who were to throw Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and they were all killed because

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:53.280
the furnace was so hot.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.840
Brothers, this is real.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.120
This is real persecution.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.240
This is real fire.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.599
But what happens?

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:06.639
Look at verse 24, Nebuchadnezzar looks in the fire.

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:10.240
He says, did we not tie up three men and throw them in the fire?

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.560
Yes.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:19.040
He says, look, I see four men walking about free in the midst of the fire and they are unharmed.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.639
And the fourth one looks like a son of the God, like a son of the gods.

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.920
When are you talking about peace of God?

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.560
Three men walking about in the fiery furnace.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.959
I wonder what they were saying.

00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:35.240
Well, what are you going to do today, Shadrach?

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:38.040
What are we going to do when we get out of this fiery furnace?

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:44.519
You see, not in terror, not in panic, but a picture of calmness.

00:04:44.519 --> 00:04:48.000
That's the peace of God.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.120
What about Jahashafat?

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.519
In 2 Chronicles 20, let's look at this one too.

00:04:54.519 --> 00:04:58.339
2 Chronicles 20.

00:04:58.339 --> 00:05:05.459
Now you'll see here, Jahashafat and the people of Jude are surrounded by enemy armies.

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:08.459
Verse 12, look at what he says in his prayer.

00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:12.740
We are powerless before this large crowd that is coming against us.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:18.980
We do not know what we should do, but our eyes are toward you.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.939
Imagine the concern in his heart.

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:22.980
Look at verse 13.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.980
You see, it says that all those of Jude were standing before Jehovah, including their

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.579
little ones, their wives, and their children.

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:36.860
So, you see, Jahashafat was perhaps a little bit in a state of anxiety here.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.779
Say, in Jehovah, we just don't know what to do.

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:42.899
But just like Philippians 4, 6, and 7 says,

00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:45.060
Jahashafat's supplicated Jehovah.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.740
He begged him for his help.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:52.980
He had a thankful heart, even recounting the ways that Jehovah had blessed the nation.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.699
And what happened?

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:57.779
Well, the message came from Jehovah in verse 15.

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:01.779
Do not be afraid or be terrified because of this large crowd.

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:05.379
For the battle is not yours, but God's.

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:07.220
And verse 17,

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.339
Jehovah told him, you will not need to fight this battle.

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:15.779
Take your position, stand still, see the salvation of Jehovah in your behalf.

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:19.540
Do not be afraid or be terrified.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:24.379
Well, there's immediately a different spirit in Jehovah's.

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:30.220
You can tell that he's experienced the peace of God because, look at verse 20, in 21.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.379
He immediately says to the people,

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:35.259
listen to me, O Judah, and you inhabitants of Jerusalem,

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:39.420
put faith in Jehovah our God so that you may be able to stand firm,

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:44.060
put faith in his prophets, and you will be successful.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.100
And then he appointed men to go out and singens,

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:51.339
and go before the armies of Israel, as they praised Jehovah.

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:55.180
Well, as a result, of course, the nation was saved.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:00.939
Jehashafat experienced that calmness, that tranquility,

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:05.180
that comes from the peace that only God can give.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.300
Well, the same is true in our modern times.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.899
In the 1975, your books, a beautiful experience,

00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:15.819
about our dear brother Daniel Sidler, who served on the governing body.

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:20.459
He was jailed because of his Christian neutrality in 1944.

00:07:20.459 --> 00:07:25.899
On his first night in prison, he was lying on top of his bunk,

00:07:25.899 --> 00:07:29.259
and he was listening, as the steel gates,

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:33.980
he says, like rumbling thunder rolled to a close.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.899
One by one, the sound of those gates came closer and closer,

00:07:37.899 --> 00:07:43.899
until his cell gate quivered, and then rolled slowly shut.

00:07:43.899 --> 00:07:49.899
He said suddenly, an overwhelmingly sickening sensation swept

00:07:49.899 --> 00:07:54.939
over me, which made me feel trapped, without a way out.

00:07:54.939 --> 00:08:01.980
Then, just as quickly, followed another sensation, equally overwhelming,

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:05.019
which made me feel great peace and joy.

00:08:05.019 --> 00:08:07.980
The kind of peace that the Bible speaks about,

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:12.860
the peace of God that surpasses all understanding.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:16.379
Isn't that wonderful? How about this one?

00:08:16.459 --> 00:08:21.500
This is a farewell letter that a young brother wrote to his parents

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.180
during the time of Nazi Germany.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.259
This is what he wrote to them.

00:08:27.259 --> 00:08:30.860
It is now nine o'clock on the day of my trial,

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.740
but I must wait till 1130.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:38.460
I am writing these lines in a solitary cell of the state military court.

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:42.620
I have such peace, which is really hardly believable,

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.940
but I have also committed all to the Lord

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:48.379
so that I can calmly wait for that hour.

00:08:48.379 --> 00:08:51.259
Then at 1230, he continued his letter.

00:08:51.259 --> 00:08:53.179
It's all over now.

00:08:53.179 --> 00:08:56.059
In view of the fact that I maintained my objection,

00:08:56.059 --> 00:08:58.460
the death sentence was decreed.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:01.419
I listened, and then after I had spoken the words,

00:09:01.419 --> 00:09:05.259
be thou faithful unto death, and a few other words of our Lord,

00:09:05.259 --> 00:09:09.259
it was all over. But never mind that now.

00:09:09.259 --> 00:09:12.860
I have such peace, such tranquility,

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.580
that you can't possibly imagine.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.259
Isn't that amazing?

00:09:17.259 --> 00:09:20.860
The peace of God came upon that dear brother

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.659
before he was executed.

00:09:23.659 --> 00:09:25.980
Well, now in Russia, what do we see?

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.700
Our brothers are facing armed and masked men,

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.580
breaking down their doors of their homes,

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:36.620
doing home searches, breaking up meetings, court cases, imprisonment.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.980
But there are so many wonderful experiences of how Jehovah

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.700
has given the peace of God to our brothers.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.740
During one search on a brother's home,

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:48.379
the brother began to worry and feel anxiety.

00:09:48.379 --> 00:09:50.139
He prayed to Jehovah,

00:09:50.139 --> 00:09:53.340
I don't know what to do, give me advice.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:55.980
Just then the investigator doing the home search

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:59.980
began looking at the magnets on the brother's refrigerator,

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:02.860
and loudly and expressively read the inscription

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:04.620
on one of the fridge magnets,

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:10.139
do not be anxious for I am your God.

00:10:10.139 --> 00:10:15.259
The brother right away understood what he needed to do.

00:10:15.259 --> 00:10:17.500
Well, brothers, what's the point?

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:20.779
Regardless of what may be happening around us,

00:10:20.779 --> 00:10:23.340
what persecution we may face,

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:26.779
how challenging the situation may be

00:10:26.779 --> 00:10:31.179
if we supplicate Jehovah with a thankful heart,

00:10:31.179 --> 00:10:34.139
he will give us a precious gift,

00:10:34.139 --> 00:10:38.940
the peace of God that surpasses all understanding.
