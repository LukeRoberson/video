00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:07.139
Welcome to JW Broadcasting. We're so happy you could join us.

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:12.140
In the next hour, we'll learn why putting Jehovah's will ahead of our own interests,

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.140
improves our life, and protects us from harm.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.140
We all appreciate being recognized by others.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.140
In an interview, we'll see why recognition from Jehovah brings the most joy.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.140
Are you a young person looking to start a career?

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:37.140
If so, you'll appreciate learning how two young witnesses found work to support themselves and their ministry.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:44.140
And we'll see how husbands and wives can work as a team to increase the love and peace in marriage.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:01:09.560
This is the March 2025 edition of JW Broadcasting.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.560
Our theme this month is keep seeking great things for Jehovah.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.560
It's based on some powerful advice that Jehovah gave to a man named Berrick.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.560
Who was Berrick? What can his example teach us?

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.560
And how can the Divine Council he received help us today?

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.560
Let's find out.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.560
Berrick was a faithful servant of Jehovah.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.560
He appears in the Bible book of Jeremiah about the year 625 BCE.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:48.560
Let's start our journey by reading Jeremiah chapter 45 verse 1.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.560
This is the word that Jeremiah, the prophet, spoke to Berrick,

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.560
the son of Nariah when he wrote in a book,

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:04.560
these words dictated by Jeremiah in the fourth year of Jehoyakim, son of Josiah, the king of Judah.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.560
Berrick served as Jeremiah's personal secretary.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.560
The two worked closely together for some 18 years,

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.560
including after the destruction of Jerusalem in 607 BCE.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.560
That was certainly a special privilege of service during a very challenging time.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.560
But why did Jeremiah need an assistant?

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:36.560
For some 23 years, Jeremiah had been conveying a message of judgment and hope to God's people in Judah.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:45.560
In the year 625 BCE, it seems that Jeremiah had been barred from the temple area where Jehovah's message was to be read.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.560
At that time, Jehovah asked Jeremiah to write his warnings in a scroll.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.560
That's where Berrick, a scribe or a secretary, comes into the picture.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:03.560
He wrote in a scroll all the words that Jehovah had spoken through Jeremiah up until that time,

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.560
23 years worth.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.560
The following year, when the time came for the contents of that scroll to be read aloud in the temple courtyard,

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.560
Jeremiah asked Berrick to deliver the message.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.560
Again, Berrick did just so.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.560
What happened next?

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:28.560
When the princes of Judah heard what Berrick had done, they wanted to hear the message firsthand.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.560
So Berrick read it out loud again.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.560
As soon as they heard it, the account says they looked at one another in dread.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.560
They told Berrick, we must certainly tell the king all these words.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:52.560
Before doing so, they warned Berrick, go and hide yourselves, you and Jeremiah, and do not let anyone know where you are.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.560
Wicked King Jehoiikum was hot with anger.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:05.560
He burned the scroll and ordered that Jeremiah and Berrick be arrested.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.560
Now, let's pause and think.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.560
From what we've considered so far, what can we learn from Berrick?

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.560
First, he was humble.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.560
Many scholars believe that he belonged to a prominent scribal family.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:30.560
Yet when the invitation came to help Jeremiah, Berrick proceeded to do according to all that Jeremiah the prophet had commanded him.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:39.560
Like you, brothers and sisters, Berrick was happy to support Jehova's work and to do whatever was asked of him.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.560
He did not let his family status or personal goals distract him.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:52.560
Because he was humble, he put Jehova's will first in his life.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.560
Berrick also demonstrated endurance.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:02.560
Do you think putting 23 years worth of divine messages in writing took some time?

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.560
Of course.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.560
Berrick didn't have a modern tool such as a smartphone tablet or computer.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.560
It was a lot of manual work.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:19.560
And imagine Berrick's shock when the king burned up the first scroll.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.560
That was Jehova's message.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.560
That was the scroll that Berrick had written by hand.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.560
Hours of work up in smoke.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.560
Jeremiah, chapter 36, verse 32 steps.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.560
Jeremiah then took another scroll and gave it to Berrick.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:49.560
And at Jeremiah's dictation, he wrote on it all the words of the scroll that King Jehoya came of Judah had burned in the fire.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.560
And many more words like those were added.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:02.560
Like Berrick, we too need endurance to stick to our sacred work when there are challenges.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.560
Consider, too, Berrick's courage.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.560
He must have known how dangerous it would be to work with Jeremiah.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:19.560
Earlier, the same king that burned up the scroll killed another prophet of Jehova, Eurygia, by the sword.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:26.560
But Berrick fearlessly used his professional skills and contacts to support Jehova's prophet.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:35.560
There's so much we can learn from this God-fearing man who demonstrated humility, endurance, and courage.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.560
Jehova loved Berrick, and so do we.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:46.560
Of course, Berrick, like us, confronted negative thoughts and feelings.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.560
There was one challenge that could have cost him dearly.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.560
What was it?

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.560
Let's continue the reading in Jeremiah, chapter 45, verses 2 and 3.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:02.560
And please note, Jehova's personal interest in Berrick.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.560
Jeremiah, 45, 2 and 3 says.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:11.560
This is what Jehova, the God of Israel, says concerning you, Berrick.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:18.560
You have said, whoa to me, for Jehova has added grief to my pain.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:25.560
I am weary from my groaning, and I have found no resting place.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.560
Why was Berrick feeling like that?

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.560
Was he getting tired of his assignment?

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:35.560
Or perhaps the circumstances in which he had to perform it?

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.560
Let's keep reading, verses 4 and 5.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:43.560
You should say to him, this is what Jehova says.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:50.560
Look, what I have built up, I am tearing down.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:55.560
And what I have planted, I am uprooting, the entire land.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.560
But you are seeking great things for yourself.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.560
Stop seeking such things.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:07.560
For I am about to bring a calamity on all flesh, declares Jehova.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:12.560
And wherever you may go, I will grant you your life as a spoil.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:19.509
What reason did Jehova give for Berrick's feelings?

00:08:19.509 --> 00:08:24.509
It was not the assignment itself or even his circumstances.

00:08:24.509 --> 00:08:30.509
In verse 5, Jehova said, you are seeking great things for yourself.

00:08:30.509 --> 00:08:32.509
Think about that.

00:08:32.509 --> 00:08:38.509
It was Berrick's own view of what seemed great or most important.

00:08:38.509 --> 00:08:43.509
For a time, he was focused on seeking great things for himself.

00:08:44.509 --> 00:08:47.509
What do you think those great things could have been?

00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:51.509
Was it a desire for fame or prestige?

00:08:51.509 --> 00:08:57.509
Was he sensing that his support for God's profit was putting at risk his position and career?

00:08:57.509 --> 00:09:00.509
Or did the great things have to do with getting more money?

00:09:00.509 --> 00:09:03.509
Property or some material possessions?

00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:05.509
We don't know.

00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:09.509
But Berrick knew what they were and Jehova's counsel was clear.

00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:12.509
Stop seeking such things.

00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:18.509
It seems Berrick took Jehova's counsel to heart.

00:09:18.509 --> 00:09:23.509
I imagine him reasoning something like this.

00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:28.509
Jehova knows my thoughts and feelings.

00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:32.509
Have I really been seeking great things for myself?

00:09:32.509 --> 00:09:34.509
It's true.

00:09:34.509 --> 00:09:36.509
Jehova's always right.

00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:41.509
My desires got the better of me and I was so distressed.

00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:46.509
But Jehova's kindly telling me, Berrick, be realistic.

00:09:46.509 --> 00:09:48.509
A divine judgment is coming.

00:09:48.509 --> 00:09:53.509
Everything that seems so stable will be uprooted.

00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:55.509
Material things.

00:09:55.509 --> 00:09:59.509
Property, money, or a prominent career, it's all temporary.

00:09:59.509 --> 00:10:03.509
Seeking those things is dangerous.

00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:09.509
Jehova wants me and others to survive the common calamity.

00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:12.509
And that's what I want.

00:10:12.509 --> 00:10:18.509
I need to get back to seeking great things for Jehova.

00:10:18.509 --> 00:10:23.509
Well, that's just a possibility of how Berrick might have been thinking.

00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:27.509
But did he accept and follow the counsel?

00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:28.509
Yes.

00:10:28.509 --> 00:10:33.509
During the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem about 17 years later,

00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:38.509
Berrick appears again in the inspired record supporting Jeremiah.

00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:43.509
And though many others died during the catastrophic destruction of Jerusalem,

00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:46.509
Berrick and Jeremiah survived.

00:10:46.509 --> 00:10:52.509
Berrick's humble response to Jehova's counsel saved his life

00:10:52.509 --> 00:10:59.509
and such a response to divine counsel can do the same for us.

00:10:59.509 --> 00:11:02.509
I'm sure as you think more about Berrick,

00:11:02.509 --> 00:11:06.509
you'll see other ways we can benefit from his example.

00:11:06.509 --> 00:11:09.509
But let's briefly discuss one particular challenge

00:11:09.509 --> 00:11:12.509
that some of us might be facing right now

00:11:12.509 --> 00:11:15.509
and how Berrick's experience can help.

00:11:15.509 --> 00:11:17.509
The challenge?

00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:23.509
Being balanced while providing materially for ourselves and our families.

00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:28.509
In today's world, many people are seeking great things for themselves,

00:11:28.509 --> 00:11:33.509
as they pursue secular education and secular work.

00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:37.509
Many believe that the key to success and the key to there

00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:42.509
and their family's happiness involves money and getting more material things

00:11:42.509 --> 00:11:47.509
or a resting place in this system of things.

00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:51.509
Such thinking could influence us.

00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:55.509
If you're a family head, consider Chibisa.

00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:57.509
He's a brother in Malawi,

00:11:57.509 --> 00:12:02.509
who along with his wife and seven children were doing well spiritually.

00:12:02.509 --> 00:12:06.509
However, at one point, they faced financial problems.

00:12:06.509 --> 00:12:11.509
At times, there was not enough money to buy food for each day.

00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:13.509
How stressful.

00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:18.509
Like many others, Chibisa decided to go to South Africa to find work.

00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:21.509
That was a personal decision.

00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:23.509
But was it wise?

00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:26.509
Looking back, Chibisa said this.

00:12:26.509 --> 00:12:29.509
This affected me spiritually

00:12:30.509 --> 00:12:32.509
because I did not know the language.

00:12:32.509 --> 00:12:36.509
I was unable to preach and I did not benefit from the meetings.

00:12:36.509 --> 00:12:42.509
Being so far from my family caused me to neglect my responsibility as a family head.

00:12:42.509 --> 00:12:47.509
As a result, my family grew weak spiritually,

00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:50.509
and we all missed each other very much.

00:12:50.509 --> 00:12:54.509
I realized that I had made a wrong decision going abroad.

00:12:54.509 --> 00:13:00.210
My conscience started to trouble me greatly.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:06.210
My parents must also make personal decisions about secular education for your children.

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:10.210
Naturally, you want them to get a good education.

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:14.210
But you have to think carefully about potential dangers.

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.210
For example, in some countries,

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:20.210
parents send their young children away to boarding schools.

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:26.210
The March 15, 1997 issue of the Watchtower discussed the scriptural principles involved,

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:31.210
and related a number of experiences highlighting the dangers.

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:35.210
A brother named Clement said that before going away to boarding school,

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:39.210
he loved the truth and enjoyed participating in the ministry,

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:42.210
in family worship, and at meetings.

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:44.210
However, he said,

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:47.210
Once I went into boarding school at the age of 14,

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:50.210
I left the truth completely.

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:53.210
Throughout the five years I spent in boarding school,

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:55.210
I never attended meetings.

00:13:55.210 --> 00:14:02.460
As a result of bad company, I got involved with drugs, smoking, and heavy drinking.

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.460
Let's consider one more situation.

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:12.460
You younger Christians approaching adulthood must make decisions involving education and employment.

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:14.460
There may be many choices,

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:19.460
but which ones will help you live up to your dedication to Jehovah?

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:21.460
One sister said this,

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:27.460
As a baptized witness, I had read and heard about the dangers of pursuing university education,

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.460
but I dismissed such warnings.

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:34.460
I thought that counsel did not apply to me.

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:38.460
Well, our sister made her personal choice in the matter,

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.460
but was it a wise one?

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.460
She continues,

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:46.460
Studying for my courses took so much time and effort

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:51.460
that I was too busy to linger in prayer to Jehovah the way I used to,

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:55.460
too exhausted to enjoy Bible discussions with others,

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.460
and too tired to prepare well for the meetings.

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:05.460
Thankfully, once I realized that being immersed in higher education was damaging my relationship with Jehovah,

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:10.460
I knew I had to stop, and I did.

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:14.460
Of what do these real life examples remind us?

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:24.460
In Satan's system of things, we will face challenges that test our determination to put Jehovah's will first in our lives.

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:29.460
Like Barrick, personal desires could distract us.

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:36.460
If that ever happens, we need to take quick action to correct our viewpoint as did Barrick.

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:41.460
Happily, through the Bible and spiritual instruction from the faithful slave,

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:45.460
Jehovah helps us make better choices in personal areas of life,

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:50.460
such as those involving secular education and secular work.

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:54.460
At Psalm 32-8, he promises,

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:59.460
I will give you insight and instruct you in the way you should go.

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:05.460
I will give you advice with my eye upon you.

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:10.460
We are wise to seek out such advice by doing research,

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:15.460
by talking to mature Christians, and then applying such counsel.

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:21.460
Chabisa did that after moving to South Africa, his conscience started bothering him,

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:25.460
and he remembered the example of Barrick.

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.460
Chabisa said this,

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:32.460
Barrick may have wanted to pursue material riches as I had.

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:35.460
When he was helped, he returned.

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:41.460
I decided then to put Jehovah in first place instead of searching for material things,

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:46.460
so I started to make changes to go home and help my family spiritually.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:52.460
When I left South Africa and reached the border of Malawi, I felt great happiness in my heart,

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:55.460
and I am still happy.

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:57.460
Studying the Bible has helped me.

00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:00.460
We still encounter financial problems,

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:06.460
but I remember that in Satan's world, there is nowhere we can go and have no problems.

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:09.460
My family is progressing spiritually,

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:18.460
and this makes me very happy because my relationship with Jehovah is strong.

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:24.460
Like Barrick, Chabisa was humble and courageous,

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:30.460
and we know those same qualities characterize you, brothers and sisters.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:37.460
So when Jehovah, our loving father, gives us timely advice as he did to his close friend Barrick,

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.460
let's take it to heart.

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:47.460
Let's do whatever it takes to make sure we and our families continue seeking first the Kingdom and God's Righteousness,

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:53.460
and never forget, as we continue to seek great things for Jehovah,

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:57.460
he'll continue to do great things for us and our families.

00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:04.460
Yes, it's his blessing that makes us truly rich and he adds no pain with it.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:12.140
Have you ever felt unseen in a Theocratic assignment,

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:16.140
or forgotten about when you're no longer in it?

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:20.140
If so, you'll appreciate how a brother named Avanash,

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:24.140
along with the Caterl family, adjusted their thinking.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:42.980
Note how they found joy in seeking recognition from Jehovah rather than from others.

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.980
I worked in an office in the financial district.

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.980
I enjoyed everything about working there,

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:56.980
passing these tall skyscrapers, institutions with big names in terms of what I wanted from life.

00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:59.980
At that time, it was great.

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:03.980
Spiritually, it was not the best at all.

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:08.980
You have to make yourself stand out, that really affected my personality.

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:13.329
I didn't even realise it at the time.

00:19:13.329 --> 00:19:18.329
I was pioneering and I decided to apply for Bethel and was accepted.

00:19:18.329 --> 00:19:20.329
And my assignment was to do cleaning.

00:19:20.329 --> 00:19:23.329
And from my background, that kind of work,

00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:26.329
it was something that was looked down on.

00:19:26.329 --> 00:19:28.329
It's not something you would choose to do.

00:19:28.329 --> 00:19:31.329
I was used to an environment where if you did well,

00:19:31.329 --> 00:19:35.329
you could move to the next step and you'd be recognised for it.

00:19:35.329 --> 00:19:40.329
And this was the case for me that I derived so much value from these external things,

00:19:40.329 --> 00:19:44.329
these privileges, and being set apart from others.

00:19:44.329 --> 00:19:49.329
I thrived on that commendation, both at work and in the congregation.

00:19:49.329 --> 00:19:53.329
So when you don't get it, then you feel lost a little bit.

00:19:53.329 --> 00:19:55.329
Other brothers were getting more recognition.

00:19:55.329 --> 00:19:58.329
And that just played in my head a little bit.

00:19:58.329 --> 00:20:05.220
The spiritual environment in Bethel has taught me and is teaching me

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:10.220
that our value is nothing to do with the privileges that we enjoy.

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:14.220
But when we feed off the recognition from men,

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:18.220
it's almost like we're chasing the next,

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:21.220
you know, the next compliment or the next praise.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:24.220
You can always feel like you're chasing happiness.

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:29.220
But you know, switching my thinking to thinking about Jehovah's recognition,

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:33.220
it gives you more peace and it's more sustainable.

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:38.220
And it really helped me to see that no matter what circumstances I'm in,

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:41.220
I can be happy, I can be joyful.

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:44.220
He's been good moulding.

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:55.569
Sandy and I got married in 2003.

00:20:55.569 --> 00:20:59.569
Sandy was pioneering back then and I was happy to support her.

00:21:00.569 --> 00:21:03.569
Then we found out that we were expecting a baby.

00:21:03.569 --> 00:21:05.569
We were really excited.

00:21:05.569 --> 00:21:11.569
I still was hoping that after I had the baby that I would be able to continue,

00:21:11.569 --> 00:21:14.569
pioneering, that was the plan anyway.

00:21:14.569 --> 00:21:17.569
We just thought to ourselves, this is how we can grow them out.

00:21:17.569 --> 00:21:23.569
They can serve Jehovah, go to Bethel, all of the stuff that you want your child to do.

00:21:23.569 --> 00:21:28.569
One day, very late on in the pregnancy, I received a phone call from Sandy.

00:21:28.569 --> 00:21:33.569
She was rushed into hospital for an emergency cesarean and everything changed.

00:21:33.569 --> 00:21:39.259
We're so glad that he made it through.

00:21:39.259 --> 00:21:42.259
Thankfully, he survived.

00:21:42.259 --> 00:21:49.259
Later on, we found out that he had severe brain damage.

00:21:49.259 --> 00:21:53.259
We had to learn how to operate medical machinery.

00:21:53.259 --> 00:21:55.259
We had to learn what syringe was.

00:21:55.259 --> 00:21:59.259
We had to learn so much stuff that we'd never even had to think about before.

00:21:59.259 --> 00:22:10.259
I used to feel like why was our path to get to the new world harder than other brothers and sisters?

00:22:10.259 --> 00:22:18.259
I felt isolated and lonely because I felt that no one understood what I was going through

00:22:18.259 --> 00:22:20.259
and what it felt like.

00:22:20.259 --> 00:22:23.259
No one around me was in my situation.

00:22:23.259 --> 00:22:26.259
We really enjoyed the assembly.

00:22:26.259 --> 00:22:33.259
We'd sit near the front, sit where we could focus on what was going on and all of a sudden.

00:22:33.259 --> 00:22:36.259
Eden's born. We're at the back.

00:22:36.259 --> 00:22:39.259
We're right at the back.

00:22:39.259 --> 00:22:45.259
It was very, very hard to accept that although I wanted to be somewhere,

00:22:45.259 --> 00:22:51.259
a certain time spiritually, it just wasn't going to happen because I was in a completely different situation.

00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:01.200
Eden now has a little sister, Angel, who is also a blessing from Jehovah.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:07.200
Although our goals in life changed and we might not be able to do as much as we used to do,

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:13.200
we know that Jehovah is really appreciative on everything that we do.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:18.200
And as a family, we've set a goal of being out in the ministry together at least once a month.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:25.200
It takes a lot to get Eden ready for his lot of preparation and a lot of medication

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:29.200
and there's a lot of hidden things that the congregation don't see.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:36.200
We know that Jehovah has seen us struggling in the evenings.

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.200
He's looking there at the sleepless night.

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:43.200
He can help you to cope, to be happy with small blessings.

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:49.200
I don't do it every day but I try to write down what I'm grateful for, what Jehovah has given me.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:56.200
And this really helps me not only to be focused but to have more appreciative prayers to Jehovah

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:59.200
about what he's doing for me now.

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:02.200
We know that Jehovah values our family.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:09.960
Isn't it comforting to know Jehovah recognizes our household service,

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.960
even when it feels like others don't?

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:15.960
Many of us need to work to support ourselves,

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:21.960
but finding the type of work that allows us to serve Jehovah whole soul may be challenging.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:27.960
Let's see how Bible principles influence the career decisions of two young publishers.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:39.920
Why was it difficult to choose a career?

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:44.650
Most of my family have a university degree.

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:48.650
Some are lawyers, engineers, accountants, and so on.

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:51.650
So they expected me to go to university as well.

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:54.650
They told me, we don't have a doctor in the family yet.

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:57.650
We think you should study medicine.

00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:00.650
When I was 16, I was about to leave high school.

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:05.650
Many of my schoolmates were planning to study at university and would say things like,

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:08.650
I want to go to this school, which one are you going to?

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:11.650
I felt a lot of pressure to get a higher education.

00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:17.650
My teachers told me that I needed to continue my studies if I really wanted to make money.

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:21.650
I wanted to be a teacher, but there were so much pressure from my family

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:25.650
to study something that would allow me to have a higher salary.

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:30.650
There were times when I felt overwhelmed because of the pressure.

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:34.650
Even after I graduated from high school, a teacher contacted me to make sure

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:38.650
that I was planning to go to university, and in his words,

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:41.650
actually become someone in this world.

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:46.650
I started a six-year psychology degree at university.

00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:51.650
And at the same time, I was studying for a teacher certificate on the weekends.

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:55.650
And on top of all of that, I was working part-time.

00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:58.650
I was trying to do everything.

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:04.329
What helped you make a good decision?

00:26:04.329 --> 00:26:08.609
I spoke with my mom about what I should do.

00:26:08.609 --> 00:26:13.609
She helped me to think about some of the dangers I would be exposed to at university.

00:26:13.609 --> 00:26:17.609
Things that could endanger me in a spiritual sense.

00:26:18.609 --> 00:26:23.609
After about two years, it became clear that I couldn't continue with such a busy routine.

00:26:23.609 --> 00:26:26.609
I needed to make a change.

00:26:26.609 --> 00:26:29.609
I remembered some advice I got from a friend.

00:26:29.609 --> 00:26:33.609
He had studied to become an accountant when he was young, but now he sells chilies.

00:26:33.609 --> 00:26:36.609
He jokingly said, so now I'm counting chilies.

00:26:36.609 --> 00:26:39.609
So I guess you could say that it is what I studied.

00:26:39.609 --> 00:26:47.109
He explained that many people end up in jobs that have nothing to do with their university degree.

00:26:47.109 --> 00:26:50.109
Philippians 110 helped me.

00:26:50.109 --> 00:26:53.109
It says that we should make sure of the more important things.

00:26:53.109 --> 00:26:57.109
I knew that finding a job was important.

00:26:57.109 --> 00:27:01.109
But it was more important that I had time for Jehovah.

00:27:01.109 --> 00:27:05.109
I've always loved Jehovah's promise at Matthew 633,

00:27:05.109 --> 00:27:08.109
where he says that he will make sure we have what we need

00:27:08.109 --> 00:27:13.109
if we keep seeking for seeking to mend his righteousness.

00:27:13.109 --> 00:27:16.109
I had already seen this promise come true in my life.

00:27:16.109 --> 00:27:20.109
So I trusted that Jehovah would continue to provide for me.

00:27:20.109 --> 00:27:23.109
I knew that if I studied at university,

00:27:23.109 --> 00:27:26.109
I would be losing valuable time during my youth,

00:27:26.109 --> 00:27:30.109
time that I could be using for Jehovah.

00:27:30.109 --> 00:27:33.109
Sometimes we have many different options in front of us,

00:27:33.109 --> 00:27:36.109
or we know that we need to adjust our course.

00:27:36.109 --> 00:27:42.869
That's when looking to Bible principles can help us to choose the right path.

00:27:42.869 --> 00:27:46.869
My father has a barber shop, and he offered to teach me how to be a barber.

00:27:46.869 --> 00:27:50.869
My parents told me, people will always need a haircut.

00:27:50.869 --> 00:27:54.869
So even though I knew I wouldn't be making millions as a barber,

00:27:54.869 --> 00:27:58.869
it was work that would always be in demand.

00:27:58.869 --> 00:28:01.869
I decided to leave university halfway through my degree

00:28:01.869 --> 00:28:04.869
and look for part-time teaching work.

00:28:04.869 --> 00:28:10.869
During that time, I prayed so much, asking Jehovah to bless my decision.

00:28:10.869 --> 00:28:16.619
What benefits have come from your decisions?

00:28:17.619 --> 00:28:20.619
On my own boss, I work in a barber shop

00:28:20.619 --> 00:28:23.619
and also travel to people's homes and give them haircuts.

00:28:23.619 --> 00:28:27.619
I have the freedom to decide the days and hours that I work.

00:28:27.619 --> 00:28:29.619
Jehovah answered my prayers.

00:28:29.619 --> 00:28:32.619
I was able to find part-time work teaching at a school,

00:28:32.619 --> 00:28:37.619
which allows me to be in full-time service, along with my husband.

00:28:37.619 --> 00:28:40.619
Because of the flexibility I have with my work,

00:28:40.619 --> 00:28:45.619
I enjoy opportunities to participate in construction projects for the organization.

00:28:46.619 --> 00:28:50.619
I've seen clearly that by focusing on what's most important,

00:28:50.619 --> 00:28:52.619
Jehovah has blessed me.

00:28:52.619 --> 00:28:56.619
I continue to see the fulfillment of Matthew 6.33 in my life.

00:28:56.619 --> 00:29:13.359
Jehovah has always provided what I needed.

00:29:13.359 --> 00:29:17.359
If you're having trouble choosing the right type of work,

00:29:17.359 --> 00:29:20.359
consider talking to others about how they chose jobs

00:29:20.359 --> 00:29:23.359
that allow them to actively serve Jehovah.

00:29:23.359 --> 00:29:25.359
Most important, pray.

00:29:25.359 --> 00:29:27.359
Share your feelings with Jehovah.

00:29:27.359 --> 00:29:31.359
Tell him about your needs, goals, and preferences.

00:29:31.359 --> 00:29:35.359
Remember, no one is more interested in providing for you,

00:29:35.359 --> 00:29:39.359
materially and spiritually, than Jehovah.

00:29:39.359 --> 00:29:45.359
Among those who benefit from turning to Jehovah for direction are missionaries.

00:29:45.359 --> 00:29:50.359
This episode of our History and Motion shows how Jehovah has used

00:29:50.359 --> 00:29:54.359
self-sacrificing missionaries to spearhead the global preaching work

00:29:55.359 --> 00:29:58.359
to the most distant parts of the earth.

00:29:58.359 --> 00:30:04.119
You will be witnesses of me to the most distant part of the earth.

00:30:04.119 --> 00:30:11.119
Nearly 2,000 years ago, Jesus laid the groundwork for true missionary service.

00:30:11.119 --> 00:30:16.119
Since then, how have others answered the call to service a missionary?

00:30:16.119 --> 00:30:24.170
That's the subject of this episode of Our History and Motion.

00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:28.170
In the first century, Paul, Barnabas, Mark, and others

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:31.170
traveled extensively to bring the good news to people

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:34.170
and rejoiced as they saw them respond.

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:37.170
Jehovah's people have continued this mission today

00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:41.170
with the same zeal, tireless dedication and joy.

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:46.170
C.T. Russell and J.F. Rutherford were missionaries themselves.

00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:49.170
Both traveled to distant lands such as the Philippines,

00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:55.170
France, Greece, Egypt, Israel, and India.

00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:58.170
Their goal to reach as many as possible

00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:01.170
as the wonderful kingdom message.

00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:05.170
Their fine example led others to reach out and do the same.

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:11.170
In 1922, William R. Brown, who had been preaching throughout the Caribbean,

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:13.170
wrote to Brother Rutherford,

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:17.170
I have given a witness throughout the majority of the Caribbean islands.

00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:20.170
Should I go over them again?

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:25.170
Brother Rutherford's reply, proceed to Sierra Leone, West Africa.

00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:28.480
And that's just what he did.

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:32.480
Brother Brown and his family served 27 years in West Africa,

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.480
always emphasizing the importance of the Bible,

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:38.480
which aptly earned him the name, Bible Brown.

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:44.180
When looking back over many decades of faithful service,

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:47.180
how did Brother Brown feel?

00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:54.180
He said, what a joy it is to see men and women becoming obedient to the good news of God's kingdom.

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:59.180
It is one of the highest privileges that can be offered to a human creature

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:05.309
to be an ambassador of Jehovah.

00:32:05.309 --> 00:32:09.309
In July 1926, George Wright and Edwin Skinner

00:32:09.309 --> 00:32:15.309
left London on a boat headed to Bombay, India, now known as Mumbai.

00:32:16.309 --> 00:32:21.309
There, these brothers set up a small branch office to oversee the preaching work.

00:32:21.309 --> 00:32:25.309
To spread the kingdom message, the two brothers would split up.

00:32:25.309 --> 00:32:27.309
One traveled deep into the land,

00:32:27.309 --> 00:32:31.309
while the other stayed back to care for the branch office matters.

00:32:31.309 --> 00:32:36.309
By 1938, a great witness had been given all throughout the land.

00:32:36.309 --> 00:32:39.309
Twenty-four congregations were established.

00:32:39.309 --> 00:32:42.309
Literature was translated and distributed.

00:32:42.309 --> 00:32:49.390
Look, meetings were arranged, and the good news was even delivered by radio.

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:51.390
But then came World War II,

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:56.390
and in over fifty nations, the work of Jehovah's Witnesses was restricted.

00:32:56.390 --> 00:33:01.390
The door appeared to be closing for accepting missionaries in many parts of the earth.

00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:03.390
From a human standpoint,

00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:07.390
it could have seemed wise to pause the missionary work.

00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:10.390
But Jehovah knew better.

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:14.390
In September 1942, Nathan North, full of faith,

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:18.390
proposed the establishment of a school to train missionaries.

00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:21.390
The first class of the Watchtower Bible College of Gilead

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:26.390
began on a winter day in upstate New York in 1943.

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:31.390
And the timing turned out to be just right, as World War II ended.

00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:34.390
The door began opening back up,

00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:38.390
and a global opportunity awaited future missionaries.

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:43.390
Looking back, Gilead has had a huge impact on our worldwide growth.

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:46.390
For example, in 1949,

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:50.390
Japan reported less than ten local publishers.

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:54.390
Shortly thereafter, in 1950, five sisters,

00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:58.390
graduates of the eleventh class of Gilead, arrived in Japan.

00:33:58.390 --> 00:34:02.390
Among them was Lois Dyer, another missionary.

00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:06.390
Over the next thirty years, Lois would travel all throughout Japan,

00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:10.389
bringing the good news to people that were hungry for it.

00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:14.389
By 1980, Lois watched the publishers in Japan

00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:18.389
grow from twelve to over fifty-two thousand.

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:20.389
How rewarding!

00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:27.389
In 2024, some 214,000 publishers preach the good news in Japan.

00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:32.389
Gilead has trained over 9,500 zealous kingdom proclaimers

00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:36.389
assigned to over 200 lands and island groups.

00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:38.389
I often think about Gilead.

00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:42.389
The effect it has now, not only on the field,

00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:45.389
and those that are going off in the missionary field,

00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:48.389
but the brothers as a whole.

00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:50.389
They have gone into these countries,

00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:53.389
and they have acclimated themselves.

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:55.389
They are a part of that country.

00:34:55.389 --> 00:34:57.389
They're just as much at home there,

00:34:57.389 --> 00:34:59.389
those that have been there for a while as the natives.

00:34:59.389 --> 00:35:01.389
And everyone that has had a part in it,

00:35:01.389 --> 00:35:05.389
either as a missionary or those of parents that have sent them off,

00:35:05.389 --> 00:35:07.389
they're never going to forget that.

00:35:07.389 --> 00:35:12.960
And I think that is a legacy that will continue forever.

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:16.960
The opportunities for missionary work remain greater than ever.

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:20.960
For example, many graduates from the School for Kingdom evangelizers

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:23.960
are assigned as field missionaries.

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:26.960
Jehovah is still holding the door wide open.

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:31.960
Hundreds of classes are held each year all around the world.

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.960
Have you considered applying?

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:38.960
The exciting adventure of missionary service continues today

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:41.960
as thousands make themselves available in imitation

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:47.619
of the greatest missionary, Jesus Christ.

00:35:47.619 --> 00:35:52.619
See you next time on Our History in Motion.

00:35:52.619 --> 00:35:57.619
Would you like to imitate the examples of missionaries?

00:35:57.619 --> 00:36:01.619
If so, talk to an elder in your congregation about your desire,

00:36:01.619 --> 00:36:06.619
start pioneering, and later apply to the School for Kingdom evangelizers

00:36:06.619 --> 00:36:09.619
if you qualify.

00:36:09.619 --> 00:36:13.619
Worship extends beyond the ministry into our personal lives,

00:36:13.619 --> 00:36:16.619
particularly within the home.

00:36:16.619 --> 00:36:21.619
If you're married, note how you and your mate can continue working together

00:36:21.619 --> 00:36:45.980
as a team to maintain a happy marriage.

00:36:45.980 --> 00:37:24.489
With so much that needs to get done in a day, every day,

00:37:24.489 --> 00:37:38.559
married couples can struggle to work together.

00:37:38.559 --> 00:37:55.099
This often leads to separate game plants.

00:37:55.099 --> 00:38:00.099
To truly be one flesh, a couple needs to work together as a team.

00:38:00.099 --> 00:38:03.099
And every team needs to have a goal.

00:38:03.099 --> 00:38:10.610
Your goal should be to have a loving relationship,

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:12.610
not just a lasting one.

00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:22.039
When marriage mates aren't teammates,

00:38:22.039 --> 00:38:40.039
disagreements can turn into fierce competition to illustrate this point.

00:38:40.039 --> 00:38:48.559
Imagine arguments are like a couple playing tennis against each other.

00:38:48.559 --> 00:38:50.559
Only one person can win.

00:38:50.559 --> 00:38:56.320
But if you change your mindset from thinking what do I want,

00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:00.320
to what do we want, then you're thinking as a team,

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:06.320
and you're able to overcome the problem and win together.

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:11.320
Once you have the team mindset, how do you work together as a team practically?

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:19.920
Ask Jehovah God for his guidance,

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:26.030
and to bless your efforts to work together on the issue at hand.

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:37.699
As you pray, talk to Jehovah about your shared desire to have a happier marriage.

00:39:37.699 --> 00:39:39.699
Talk to each other.

00:39:39.699 --> 00:39:44.699
Discuss your strong points, and where you're not so strong.

00:39:44.699 --> 00:39:59.000
And see where you can better support your partner.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:32.570
Create a plan together that you can both work toward when you think what do we want instead of what do I want.

00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:44.420
And you pray.

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:47.420
Discuss your roles, and make a plan.

00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:50.420
You can have a happy marriage as a team.

00:40:50.420 --> 00:41:00.869
Take a moment.

00:41:00.869 --> 00:41:05.869
Pause the video, and ask each other these three questions.

00:41:05.869 --> 00:41:09.869
Remember, share your honest feelings,

00:41:09.869 --> 00:41:11.869
and openly express how you both feel.

00:41:11.869 --> 00:41:20.900
We can be confident that when we do things Jehovah's way,

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:25.900
we'll experience the best results possible.

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:28.900
While we always aim to support Jehovah's will,

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:31.900
could we impede it?

00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:33.900
In the following morning worship,

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:36.900
hear Brother Splain comment on how this could happen.

00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:43.139
Now this morning, I'm going to focus on the first words of our text.

00:41:44.139 --> 00:41:52.139
It says, the word of God is alive and exerts power.

00:41:52.139 --> 00:41:56.139
The word of God is alive.

00:41:56.139 --> 00:42:04.139
Now there's no question that this text does apply to God's written word, the Bible.

00:42:04.139 --> 00:42:12.260
But Jehovah had a word, God's word existed,

00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:16.260
even before the art of writing was invented.

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:19.260
Now how long before we don't know?

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:24.260
At least as long as Jesus has been alive.

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:29.260
Before Jesus was alive, of course, Jehovah had no one to speak to.

00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:35.260
But now with the creation of Jesus, he and his son could communicate.

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:37.260
Now what is God's word?

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:40.260
We've said that it's the expression of his purpose.

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:44.260
And that means that when Jehovah says he's going to do something,

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:46.260
it's as good as done.

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:51.260
And nothing and no one can stand in the way.

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:54.260
But sometimes with the best of intentions,

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:59.260
we could actually get in the way of a decision or a project

00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:02.260
that Jehovah approves of.

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:08.260
Now we have an example of this in an event that happened in the lives of Esau and Jacob.

00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:12.260
Now who was getting in the way in that story?

00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:16.260
The faithful man, Isaac.

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:22.260
After 20 years of marriage, Isaac and Rebecca finally had two sons, Esau and Jacob.

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:25.260
But we know that Esau was the first born.

00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:28.260
And as the watchtower pointed out this week,

00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:31.260
in patriarchal times at the death of the father,

00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:34.260
why the first born took the lead in the family.

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:37.260
He was the one who conducted family worship.

00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:40.260
And he served as a sort of priest.

00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:45.260
And that's why the Bible speaks of priests being present at Mount Sinai

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:49.260
before the Levitical priesthood was set up.

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:55.260
But Jehovah had told Rebecca that Jacob was going to have the first born's position.

00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:57.260
We don't know if he told Isaac.

00:43:57.260 --> 00:44:03.260
But he did tell Rebecca that Jacob was going to have the first born's position.

00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:06.260
So the word had gone out.

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:09.260
The expression of God's purpose had gone out.

00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:13.260
Jacob would take precedence over Esau.

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:16.260
Could anyone challenge that?

00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:18.260
Now when you consider what God's purpose was,

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:20.260
Jacob was the right choice, wasn't it?

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:23.260
Because what was God's purpose?

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:27.260
It was to set up a nation of worshipers.

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:29.260
Those who were going to worship Jehovah,

00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:31.260
now between Esau and Jacob,

00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:34.260
who was most likely to conduct family worship

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:38.260
with his children, his offspring, certainly Jacob.

00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:41.260
Now for the first 15 years of their lives,

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:47.260
Esau and Jacob could probably have heard Abraham talk about the promise that God had given him,

00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:53.260
that all of the families of the earth were going to be blessed by means of his offspring.

00:44:53.260 --> 00:45:01.260
And no doubt Jacob realized what a beautiful privilege it would be to share in the fulfillment of that purpose.

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:06.260
While Rebecca loved the one Jehovah loved most, Jacob.

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:09.260
Isaac loved Esau.

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:14.260
Even after Esau had married out of the truth twice.

00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:19.260
Well, some in full-time service have a brother or sister who isn't doing very well in the truth,

00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:23.260
and yet he or she is the favorite.

00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:25.260
Go figure.

00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:32.260
Even parents in the truth don't always love the one Jehovah loves most.

00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:35.260
Now one day, Isaac had a conversation with Esau.

00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:40.260
And it's interesting, look at Genesis chapter 27.

00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:46.260
We're going to read verses 1 to 4, and there are a couple of lessons here that we're going to consider.

00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:48.260
Genesis chapter 27.

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:52.260
We're going to read verses 1 to 4.

00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:53.260
It says,

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:58.260
Now when Isaac was old and his eyes were too weak to see,

00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:01.260
he called Esau, his older son to him and said,

00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:03.260
My son.

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:05.260
He replied, Here I am.

00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:09.260
And he went on to say, I have now grown old.

00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:12.260
I do not know the day of my death.

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:16.260
So at this time, it take please your weapons, your quiver and your bow,

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:20.260
and go out to the field and hunt some wild game for me.

00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:25.260
Then make the kind of tasty dish that I'm fond of, and bring it to me.

00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:32.260
Then I will eat it so that I may bless you before I die.

00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:36.260
Before I die.

00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:40.260
So Isaac was on his deathbed, right?

00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:42.260
Wrong.

00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:49.260
If you do the math, you see that Isaac lived for 43 years after he had that last meal.

00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:54.260
But we can understand why he felt that he was on his last legs because he was blind.

00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:57.260
He couldn't do what he used to do.

00:46:57.260 --> 00:47:01.260
And so he probably thought that his life was over, and that could happen to any one of us.

00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:04.260
You know if we're in constant pain or we're crippled?

00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:07.260
Well, we might think we're finished.

00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:09.260
So here's the lesson.

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:13.260
No matter what your limitations are, don't give up on life.

00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:17.260
Find out what you can do and then do what you can.

00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:21.260
The dead can't praise Jehovah, but you can as long as you're alive.

00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:25.260
And even if you get to the point where all you can do is keep your integrity

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:28.260
and praise Jehovah, do that.

00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:31.260
Don't give up.

00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:33.260
But now let's get back to the point we started with.

00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:39.260
And that is, with the best of intentions, we could get in the way of Jehovah's purpose.

00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:45.260
Now Isaac was determined to bless Jesus and make Jacob his servant.

00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:48.260
Isaac was getting in the way.

00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:52.260
He was getting in the way of Jehovah's purpose.

00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:58.260
It seems that later Isaac realized his mistake because when Jacob was leaving to find a wife,

00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:06.260
Jacob was told, God Almighty will give you the blessing of Abraham.

00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:08.260
Isn't that beautiful?

00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:13.260
God Almighty will give you the blessing of Abraham.

00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:16.260
Tells you what kind of a man Isaac was.

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:18.260
He was a spiritual man.

00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:21.260
Yes, he loved Esau more than Jacob.

00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:24.260
And yes, he wanted Esau to have the blessing.

00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:27.260
But when Jehovah's will became clear,

00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:30.260
Isaac submitted.

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:37.260
The Apostle Paul wrote, by faith, Isaac blessed Esau and Jacob.

00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:39.260
Well, now the application.

00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:44.260
Would it be possible for us to get in the way when Jehovah decides to do something

00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:49.260
or when he approves a project that maybe we don't agree with?

00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:51.260
It could happen.

00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:55.260
The organization suggests a new way to carry out the preaching work.

00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:58.260
We tell our service group, that'll never work here.

00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:02.260
Maybe it'll work somewhere else, but not here. We're different.

00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:04.260
What about our building projects?

00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:07.260
Ramapo? Why do we need Ramapo?

00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:10.260
Armageddon's coming.

00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:16.260
In the late 40s, when the decision was made to expand world headquarters at 124 Columbia Heights,

00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:19.260
a few of the brothers took a dim view.

00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:23.260
Why spend the time and the money so close to the end?

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:29.260
Then in 1953, at the business meeting of the Watchtower Society,

00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:32.260
Brother Noah read a letter from a sister.

00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:35.260
Now, just for context, this is 1953.

00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:38.260
And in those days, as I will recall,

00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:44.260
some thought that Armageddon was going to come 40 years from 1914.

00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:46.260
We were doing a lot of counting back then.

00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:48.260
So this sister writes to Brother Noah and says,

00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:55.260
why are you spending all this money on building projects when Armageddon could come in 1954?

00:49:55.260 --> 00:50:00.260
Well, if we'd listened to her and others like her, where would we be today?

00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:04.260
Still back at 124 Columbia Heights.

00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:09.260
Speaking about our building programs, Brother Noah once made a very profound statement.

00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:11.260
It's simple, but it's profound.

00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:14.260
He said, we're going to keep building.

00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:18.260
Let Jehovah stop it if he doesn't agree with it.

00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:21.260
I think he could do that, couldn't he?

00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:27.260
Now, sometimes a body of elders has a lively discussion about some project or initiative.

00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:29.260
Maybe it's the need for a new kingdom hall.

00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:31.260
And we may have our concerns.

00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:33.260
We may have reservations.

00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:35.260
We express those.

00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:41.260
But if a number of Spirit-directed men are enthusiastically in favor of a project,

00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:45.260
it's very possible that Jehovah agrees with it, too.

00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:48.260
So we wouldn't want to get in the way.

00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:51.260
And we wouldn't want to be a naysayer.

00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:54.260
You know, sometimes what happens when we're in a building project?

00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:56.260
We have a trouble with permitting.

00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:58.260
We can't get the permits.

00:50:58.260 --> 00:50:59.260
We need right away.

00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:03.260
Or maybe a building inspector comes and he causes a lot of trouble.

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:05.260
And we wouldn't want to be the type of person who says,

00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:10.260
well, this project mustn't have Jehovah's blessing because if it had Jehovah's blessing,

00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:13.260
everything would go smoothly.

00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:16.260
Tell that to Nehemiah and the Jews in his day.

00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:18.260
They had no end of trouble.

00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:22.260
And yet what they were doing had Jehovah's approval.

00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:26.260
The word of God is alive and exerts power.

00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:31.260
When Jehovah has a purpose, we see what we can do to advance that purpose.

00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:34.260
And if there's nothing we can do, we pray for it.

00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:38.539
And then we get out of the way.

00:51:38.539 --> 00:51:44.539
It is truly faith strengthening to know that nothing can stop the advancement of Jehovah's purpose

00:51:44.539 --> 00:51:47.539
and the many good gifts he has in store for us.

00:51:47.539 --> 00:51:53.539
This month's music video gives us something else to look forward to.

00:51:53.539 --> 00:51:55.539
Life on a paradise earth.

00:51:55.539 --> 00:52:05.460
It's called, it won't be long.

00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:10.460
Time keeps on ticking, the year seems to fly.

00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:13.460
I'm not getting younger from pain.

00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:16.460
I can't hide, but I know.

00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:20.860
Oh, it won't be long.

00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:29.380
I've lost loved ones at times in my life.

00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:34.380
And living without them has been a hard fight.

00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:44.409
But I know.

00:52:44.409 --> 00:53:39.900
And I will, when the day is clear, my friend, you said.

00:53:39.900 --> 00:56:17.420
In this month's program, we learned from Barrick's example

00:56:17.420 --> 00:56:24.420
that putting Jehovah's will ahead of our own interests improves our lives and protects us from harm.

00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:29.420
We also learned the joy comes from seeking Jehovah's recognition.

00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:33.420
How young people can make good decisions when choosing a career.

00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:40.730
And how married couples can experience greater peace by working together as a team.

00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:44.730
This month's postcard comes from Liberia.

00:56:44.730 --> 00:56:51.730
Nestled on the coast of Western Africa, Liberia's terrain includes stunning landscapes.

00:56:51.730 --> 00:56:58.230
Sandy Beach is rolling hills and lush rain for us.

00:56:58.230 --> 00:57:04.230
English is the official language spoken alongside over 20 indigenous languages.

00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:14.230
Liberia, which means the land of the free, was established in 1821 as a safe haven for freed slaves from the United States.

00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:18.230
Over 60 years later, the truth began to spread.

00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:24.230
And with the help from missionaries, the first congregation was formed in 1948.

00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:32.230
From 1989 to 2003, Liberia endured devastating civil wars that affected thousands,

00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:35.230
including our brothers and sisters.

00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:39.230
Despite the hardship, they stayed positive.

00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:44.230
One brother who had to flee his home three times said,

00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:47.230
these are the conditions we preach about.

00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:50.230
We are living in the last days.

00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:56.230
Today, Jehovah's Witnesses in Liberia continue to see excellent results.

00:57:56.230 --> 00:58:09.230
For example, the East Ganta congregation with only 103 publishers had an impressive memorial attendance of 964 in 2024.

00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:14.230
The brothers had to meet in five different locations to accommodate everyone.

00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:21.230
In Robert's sport, local families highly respect the Bible and often gathered to hear the good news.

00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:29.230
The Robert sport congregation sends their love and greetings to the worldwide brotherhood.

00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:36.230
From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is J.W. Broadcasting.
