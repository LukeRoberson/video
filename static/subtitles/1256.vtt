WEBVTT

00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.370
What an experience.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.370
That's why loyalty to Jehovah has been so important.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.369
That was so true, Brother Brown.

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:12.369
How about you? Has your loyalty ever been tested?

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:14.369
Oh, yeah. I remember.

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:16.370
It was years ago.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.370
And an elder came to give me counsel after a talk.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.370
And let's just say I was not ex-

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.370
You were really quiet the whole way home.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.370
Is everything all right?

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.370
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.370
What is on your mind?

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.370
I can't believe the nerve that Ben has.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:32.369
Ben?

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.369
Yeah, Ben.

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:37.369
He gave me counsel about that talk that I gave last week.

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:39.369
Really? What did he say?

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:41.369
I don't know. Something like...

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:44.369
I didn't use enough scriptures.

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:45.369
Whatever.

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:49.740
I mean, it was hard to listen.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.740
You know, I've been an elder longer than he has.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.740
And he comes up to me and gives me counsel

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.740
about my teaching.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.740
Please tell me you didn't argue with him.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.740
Oh, of course not.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.739
But it wasn't easy.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.739
I thanked him and said something like...

00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:11.739
I'll give it careful thought.

00:01:11.739 --> 00:01:14.739
And I'll apply what he said.

00:01:14.739 --> 00:01:16.739
So you did the right thing?

00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:23.329
Yes, but did I really?

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:27.329
I took the counsel, but I don't like my attitude.

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:31.329
I let pride get in the way of another elder giving me counsel

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:34.329
just because I've been an elder longer.

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:36.329
So what are you going to do about it?

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:44.099
Pray. I mean, that's what I should do.

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:48.099
And then go to Ben and ask him to explain

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:51.099
what I didn't give him a chance to explain.

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:53.099
Wow, brother Brown.

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:56.099
I can't picture you reacting that way to counsel.

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:58.099
Let alone getting counsel.

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:01.099
That was the problem. Neither could I.

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:04.099
If I was going to remain loyal to Jehovah,

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:07.099
I needed an attitude adjustment.

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:09.099
So what did you do?

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.099
I prayed.

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.099
And I asked if I could really conduct myself as a lesser one.

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:21.099
I went back to Ben and asked him to give me the counsel that he had prepared for me.

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.099
I volunteered for assignments I hadn't done for a while.

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.099
You know, things that we do that go unnoticed.

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.099
And little by little, my attitude improved.

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.099
After that, I felt closer to Jehovah.

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.099
Seeing the need for more humility, well, was humbling.

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.099
I never realized what it seems like everyone's had lessons to learn along the way.

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.099
Believe me, I am still learning.

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.099
If I hadn't changed back then with Jehovah's help,

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.099
all things would be so different today.

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.949
If I hadn't changed back then with Jehovah's help,

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:02.949
all things would be so different today.

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:10.900
I guess I'm not the only one whose loyalty was tested.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.900
But for me, it was a little more subtle.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.240
My phone was a door to just about everything.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:26.240
But that door opened to some places I shouldn't have gone.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:32.240
At first, I thought, it's not pornography, so it's okay.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:41.240
But still, what I was seeing filled my mind with immoral thoughts.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.240
And I couldn't stop.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.240
Galatians 678 reads,

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.240
Do not be misled.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.240
God is not one to be mocked.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:57.240
For whatever a person is sewing, this, he will also reap.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.900
Reep what you sew.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.900
Reep what you sew.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.900
I was sewing unclean desires.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.900
And reaping a double heart.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.900
Desensitized to things Jehovah hates.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:26.319
Turn my eyes away from looking at what is worthless.

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:30.319
It wasn't just whether an image is considered pornography.

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:35.319
Anything that stirs up unclean thoughts is worthless.

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:39.319
And I should turn my eyes away.

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:46.410
But I had to do more.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.579
Those weren't just the psalmist words.

00:04:51.579 --> 00:04:54.579
They had to be my words.

00:04:54.579 --> 00:04:59.579
Words I've had to act on ever since to stay loyal to Jehovah.

00:04:59.579 --> 00:05:18.819
You know we've been talking about times when our loyalty has been put to the test.

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:21.819
And not to put you on the spot.

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:25.819
But didn't you have an experience?

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:26.819
I did.

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:28.819
And I don't mind sharing.

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:35.230
It was when I was at that office job in the city.

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.230
It was just coffee as usual.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.230
Karen, we're making some coffee.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.230
Did you want some?

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:42.230
I love it.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.230
The good stuff, right?

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:44.230
Oh yes.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:45.230
Thanks.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.230
Boy, I can smell it.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.230
And somebody brought treats.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:51.230
It's wonderful.

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.230
Thank you.

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:53.230
To her things gone.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.230
But this time she started telling me about her problems at home.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.230
So John, he got a text message from his ex-girlfriend.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.230
No, that must be very hard for you.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:02.230
That is.

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:06.230
You know there are some things in the Bible that have helped me in my marriage.

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.230
That I would love to show you.

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.230
I was excited about the chance to give a witness.

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:11.230
Good morning.

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:12.230
Good morning.

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:13.230
Is that for me?

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:14.230
I know how you like it.

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:15.230
Thank you.

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:20.230
It's time to time we talked, kept the conversations brief.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:21.230
And that was it.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:22.230
Hey!

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:26.230
But over time, the conversations grew.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:30.230
And husbands and family were off in the hot topic.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.230
And everyone had a few points.

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:37.230
If I may, there's some things on the scriptures that I think.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:42.230
I still thought I could give a witness and actually teach them something about Jehovah.

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:47.230
Honey, it doesn't work like that.

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.230
Sorry, Karen.

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.230
Too much information, right?

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:56.230
But in reality, I was the one being taught.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:00.180
And I was a quick learner.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:08.910
I was sure their thinking wasn't rubbing off on me until one day when Robert called.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:13.910
The girls knew that Robert and I had had a small disagreement that morning.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.910
And he was calling to apologize.

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:18.910
Although some of it was my fault.

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:23.569
Karen, did you want to get a little coffee?

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:26.569
If you don't want to talk to him now, then don't.

00:07:26.569 --> 00:07:29.569
Besides, it sounds like he could use a little silent treatment.

00:07:29.569 --> 00:07:43.319
I couldn't believe the effect the association was having on my attitude and my marriage.

00:07:43.319 --> 00:07:45.319
But what could you do?

00:07:45.319 --> 00:07:47.319
You worked with them every day.

00:07:47.319 --> 00:07:51.319
And you were able to give a witness sometimes.

00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:57.319
But I had let it turn into regular unnecessary association that was spoiling my useful habits.

00:07:57.319 --> 00:07:59.319
And that had to change.

00:07:59.319 --> 00:08:06.649
I started keeping things friendly but professional.

00:08:06.649 --> 00:08:17.310
I was more cautious as I would be if they had invited me out or if a male coworker had invited me to join him for a break.

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:19.310
So did that work?

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:20.310
It did.

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:22.310
And I was so relieved.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.310
And so was I.

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:30.310
Jehovah gave us the good morals and habits that we have.

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:37.559
Exposing myself to bad association was being disloyal to him.

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:41.559
When I think how far we are now into the...

00:08:41.559 --> 00:09:04.740
I was it out there.

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:06.740
It's not good.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.740
It won't be long, maybe an hour.

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:13.340
Is Kevin with you?

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.340
He said he's not coming.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.340
Then he doesn't want to have anything to do with us anymore.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:21.490
How sad.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:25.490
Now, this far into the great tribulation.

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:41.950
I just don't get it.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:43.950
Kevin knows we're in the great tribulation.

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:47.950
Why would he say he doesn't want anything to do with us anymore?

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:51.950
Darren, I thought you had heard by now.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:53.950
I heard what?

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:56.950
When our message changed from good news to judgment,

00:09:56.950 --> 00:10:04.639
he was telling everyone that it would make problems for us and that he was done.

00:10:04.639 --> 00:10:08.019
I can't believe it.

00:10:08.019 --> 00:10:10.019
Darren, think about it.

00:10:10.019 --> 00:10:13.019
We have all tried to help Kevin.

00:10:13.019 --> 00:10:15.019
Yeah, I remember.

00:10:15.019 --> 00:10:20.019
Think back to Sunday afternoons when we preached in the Northern Estates.

00:10:20.019 --> 00:10:22.019
We asked if he wanted to go.

00:10:22.019 --> 00:10:24.019
Did he give us a say?

00:10:24.019 --> 00:10:27.019
Well, we're gonna go to the Northern Estates and then...

00:10:27.019 --> 00:10:29.019
Hey, Kevin!

00:10:29.019 --> 00:10:31.019
He said he had a weekend shift.

00:10:31.019 --> 00:10:33.019
Again.

00:10:33.019 --> 00:10:37.419
People there have their paradise and they don't listen anyway.

00:10:37.419 --> 00:10:41.409
The car's over here.

00:10:41.409 --> 00:10:43.409
And when we do public witnessing, hey, Kevin,

00:10:43.409 --> 00:10:46.409
we've been having great experiences out there at Turner Street.

00:10:46.409 --> 00:10:48.409
Yeah, that sounds nice.

00:10:48.409 --> 00:10:50.409
Yeah, that's by your job.

00:10:50.409 --> 00:10:53.940
Do you get to talk to your co-workers about it?

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.940
He said it wasn't a good idea to make waves out of the store.

00:10:55.940 --> 00:11:02.299
For as much as we've all tried to help Kevin.

00:11:02.299 --> 00:11:06.299
He let his fear of man go unresolved.

00:11:06.299 --> 00:11:08.299
Proverbs says,

00:11:08.299 --> 00:11:10.299
What is going on out there?

00:11:10.299 --> 00:11:12.299
They're just not the town.

00:11:12.299 --> 00:11:14.299
Searching every house.

00:11:14.299 --> 00:11:16.299
Every house?

00:11:16.299 --> 00:11:19.299
Yeah, the neighbor has an panic.

00:11:19.299 --> 00:11:23.299
Let's stay calm and lean on Jehovah.

00:11:23.299 --> 00:11:53.879
Okay.

00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:56.879
We're going to have a conversation.

00:11:56.879 --> 00:11:58.879
We're going to have a conversation.

00:11:58.879 --> 00:12:00.879
We're going to have a conversation.

00:12:00.879 --> 00:12:02.879
We're going to have a conversation.

00:12:02.879 --> 00:12:04.879
We're going to have a conversation.

00:12:04.879 --> 00:12:07.879
And lean on Jehovah.

00:12:07.879 --> 00:12:11.879
At some point, we can expect the final attack on God's people.

00:12:11.879 --> 00:12:15.879
But Jehovah is going to give us the courage we need.

00:12:15.879 --> 00:12:18.879
So let's pray together.

00:12:18.879 --> 00:12:20.879
We'll read the scriptures.

00:12:20.879 --> 00:12:25.879
And we'll keep sharing what's helped us remain loyal to God.
