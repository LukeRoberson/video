00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:21.609
We all have a common enemy, death, but many wonder, is death the end of everything?

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:26.489
The Bible teaches that there is hope for the dead.

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:32.009
Jesus taught that the dead will live again.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.530
But He did more than just talk about this hope.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.250
He used his God-given power to raise people from the dead.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:49.369
The Bible promises that you can see your dead loved ones again right here on earth.

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:53.009
