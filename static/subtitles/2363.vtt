00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:29.940
As married couples, most of us have been there.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:45.189
The day-to-day pace of life, work, distractions can cause us to draw away from our mate emotionally.

00:00:45.189 --> 00:01:22.609
We begin to talk less, distance ourselves, we may feel unappreciated, and even become cold or unkind.

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:28.819
Even our desire for intimacy and affection may cool.

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:37.090
We may go from loving and passionate to platonic roommates.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.939
What can we do to avoid this?

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:50.469
An excellent principle we can apply is found at Acts 2035.

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:56.469
There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:02.349
But how can we know what to give?

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:07.700
What actions to take so our mate fills our love and affection?

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:20.520
The best way to know is simply to ask, what does our mate need?

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:36.240
Some feel loved when they are actively listened to or hear warm expressions of appreciation.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:45.729
For others its expressions of love shown through touch or simply quality time.

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:52.729
Others find that helping them with chores and sharing the workload at home makes them feel cherished.

00:02:55.199 --> 00:03:01.199
But whatever the discussion reveals, and regardless of our mate's imperfections,

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:16.439
we want to do what we can to make them feel loved and cared for through the actions they appreciate.

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:42.909
Yes, if we each do all we can to show on selfish love, genuine affection will follow.

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:48.909
And this is just one of many secrets to a happy marriage.

00:03:48.909 --> 00:04:02.550
So now why not just take a moment, pause the video and ask each other these three questions.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:08.550
Remember, share your honest feelings and when listening don't be defensive.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:14.550
This is simply a chance to openly express how each of you feels.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.550
So pause your video now and really talk.
