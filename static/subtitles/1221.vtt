00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.200
Proposes you are a prophet?

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:13.019
I was a prophet. I tried to run away from Jehovah

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.420
But when is Jehovah ever asked a prophet to go to a foreign land to preach judgment against it?

00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:24.059
What about the people?

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.300
The worship gods of war. What do you think they're like?

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:37.579
So what will you do now?

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:44.890
You need to go back inside Joanna. No, we can talk to Father Joanna

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.090
I can't go to an end of it. I just can't do it. You're Jehovah's prophet. Not anymore

00:00:51.329 --> 00:01:14.030
Go home Joanna.
