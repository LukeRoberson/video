00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.170
Mr. Alsa, did you paint these?

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.649
I did.

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:34.890
They're amazing.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.090
How long have you been drawing?

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.810
As long as I can remember,

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.729
it's my way of being able to share

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:44.530
all the stories of my life.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.369
Could you show me?

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:48.530
Yes, of course.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.170
I remember a time when I was young and in East Germany.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.250
We weren't allowed to do our work as Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.890
We were under ban.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.250
I helped in copying our watchtower magazines by hand

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.689
and then hiding them in food.

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:05.090
Did?

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.090
Yes.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.450
We'd then send the food to our brothers who were in prison.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.810
I was also asked to help in distributing

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.209
Bible literature to our congregations

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:17.849
as an underground messenger.

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:18.890
Wow.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.530
Time passed and then things started getting better in Berlin.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.090
Shortly after, I immigrated to New York.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.900
And I met my darling husband.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.900
That was a great story.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.459
Thank you.

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:39.180
But I'm sure you have stories.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.060
What do you like to draw?

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.540
Well, actually here.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.140
This was the time when Caleb and I went to the park

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.379
and he met a little girl there.

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:51.019
I'm glad I reached out that day.

00:01:51.019 --> 00:01:54.819
Lasting friends can be of any age when they love Jehovah.
