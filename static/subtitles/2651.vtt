00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:16.739
Every day, we take around 25,000 breaths of air and each breath contains a gas essential

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:20.339
for life, oxygen.

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:25.739
We need a steady supply of oxygen because our body cells use it to produce energy from

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:27.579
the food we eat.

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:32.979
But how does oxygen get from your lungs to the trillions of individual cells throughout

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:36.299
your body?

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:43.020
When you take a breath, oxygen passes from your lungs into your bloodstream, where it's

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:50.729
transported by the workhorses of oxygen transport, red blood cells.

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:56.090
Their unique shape and composition make these cells perfectly suited to deliver oxygen

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.689
precisely where and when it's needed.

00:00:59.689 --> 00:01:04.769
Each one is a tiny disc, with its center curved inward on both sides.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.209
This shape lets the cells bend and fold themselves so that they can squeeze through even the

00:01:10.209 --> 00:01:12.769
narrowest blood vessels.

00:01:12.769 --> 00:01:16.650
Red blood cells are unusual in other ways.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.409
They don't have a nucleus or the specialized structures that other cells need to survive.

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.650
For this reason, red blood cells don't use up any of the oxygen they transport.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:35.849
When their unique makeup leaves more room for their most important component, hemoglobin.

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:41.569
Each red blood cell contains over 250 million hemoglobin molecules.

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:47.250
Hemoglobin molecules work like tiny machines absorbing as much oxygen as possible when

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.329
red blood cells pass through the lungs.

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:56.769
Each hemoglobin molecule has four locations where an oxygen molecule can attach.

00:01:56.769 --> 00:02:02.170
As soon as an oxygen molecule binds to one of those locations, something remarkable

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.250
happens.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.169
The tightly folded structure of the hemoglobin changes, making it possible for as many as

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:14.870
three more oxygen molecules to be absorbed.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.669
But how does the hemoglobin know when and where to deliver the oxygen?

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:26.270
When a part of the body is exerted, it uses more oxygen.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.990
So as blood travels through your body, it passes by tissues that need oxygen and that

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.030
released carbon dioxide as waste into the blood.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.509
In the presence of carbon dioxide, hemoglobin's bond to oxygen changes.

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:46.590
The oxygen molecules that have been riding along can then break free to be absorbed by other

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.389
body cells.

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:53.430
As for the carbon dioxide that needs to be removed, most of it is chemically changed and

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.150
carried by the blood's plasma.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.389
With some also attaches to the hemoglobin molecules and returns to the lungs, where along with

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:07.949
the carbon dioxide unloaded from plasma, it can be exhaled.

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:15.509
And where the very next breath brings in a fresh supply of oxygen, ready for transport.

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:19.789
Constantly sipping through your body's thousands of miles of blood vessels, red blood cells

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:23.550
wear out after only about four months.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.150
But healthy bone marrow continuously produces up to two million new red blood cells every

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.189
second as replacement cells.

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:38.310
And the liver breaks down the worn out cells and recycles the iron found in the hemoglobin

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.990
molecules.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:49.860
It's an amazing system of delivery, pickup, and disposal.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:50.860
What do you think?

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:56.620
Did the oxygen transport system in our bodies with its trillions of red blood cells simply

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.740
evolve or was it designed?
