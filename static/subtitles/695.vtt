00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:19.789
This song was a nice introduction to a next talk presented by a member of the governing

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.309
body Anthony Morris and he will speak on the subject always re-joice.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:40.060
On a day like today I think you'll agree all of you in this 139th class it's easy to rejoice.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.820
The rejoicing has been going on since the special meal and those nice interviews and

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.579
fine job brother Loach did with our morning worship as well as the later program.

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:59.740
So the question isn't will you rejoice today you have your family you have your friends

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:08.060
we're enjoying this rejoicing in the program find lectures that we receive wonderful

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:15.180
experiences it's amazing every time these classes have these amazing field experiences.

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:20.219
The question arises though will you rejoice a month from now?

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:29.019
Will you always be rejoicing a year from now? So when it comes to this

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.819
admonition to always rejoice there's got to be more than meets the eye and we'll help you with that

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:39.980
Find Philippians chapter four this is where the talk is based

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.340
Philippians chapter four and you may have already gathered that

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:58.689
Philippians chapter four and the complete sentence in verse four always rejoice in the Lord

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:06.689
and then he repeats again I will say rejoice. Now this is clearly Jehovah's thinking about the

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:15.810
matter it's connected with our service to him we are supposed to do our best to always rejoice

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:23.330
now keep in mind he's inspired to write what he wrote here but in the same letter

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.409
let's just show you something so you see that there's more here than meets the eye to this

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:35.810
always rejoicing and what does that really mean for us as individuals applying the council

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:43.490
I'll go to chapter one just to highlight here something of interest you'll notice in verse 12

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:51.330
of Philippians chapter one he's discussing his circumstances are advancing in the good news

00:02:51.330 --> 00:03:02.050
but then he writes that my prison bonds so he's in prison not conducive to great big smiles every day

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:12.689
prison life is so good so when Paul's admonishing always rejoice you keep in mind too what he wrote

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:20.050
and what we referred to as verse 29 the last part there regarding Christ and our service to

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:28.129
follow him suffering his behalf and I hadn't heard the interviews that brother Fensum

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:35.090
nicely conducted but you can see there's things that come up in our lives you better turn

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.569
how do I rejoice through this well Paul's was because he was enduring for his God

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:49.569
and the way we always rejoice in our service to Jehovah our Heavenly Father is to keep in mind and

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:57.889
never forget the universal issue we can't lose sight of that we can't be self-absorbed with

00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:06.050
what we suffer and let's just review this turn your Bibles of Job in the very first chapter and

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.129
we're going to just remind ourselves of these events

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:26.110
Job chapter one and so loving of Jehovah God to give us what we need to equip us

00:04:26.829 --> 00:04:32.910
and I've always been so impressed with how he's really unzipped the heavens here

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:42.509
so that we could look into this heavenly scene what took place and according to verse 6 it's

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:50.589
a specific day the spirit sons of God are entering to take their station now at this point it's been

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:57.629
centuries since this rebel has been in existence with others following him following

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:06.430
priori to the flood and such while Satan enters right among them and I can only imagine

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:17.230
looks on some of the faces of the holy angels but to show you his contemptible nature at this point

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:22.110
you see in verse 7 that Jehovah says where have you come from

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:30.670
and Satan was this utter disrespect from roving about on the earth and from walking about in it

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:40.910
now Jehovah with joy says have you taken note of my servant Job there is no one like him on the earth

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:52.029
he is an upright man of integrity fearing God and shunning what is bad so this totally disrespectful

00:05:52.029 --> 00:06:01.149
person this contemptible individual begins to throw out this accusatory question

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:08.829
is it for nothing the Job has feared God have you not put up a protective hedge around him

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:15.149
and his house and everything he has you've blessed as the work of his hands in his livestock as

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:23.949
spread out in the land but for a change stretch out your hand and strike everything he has and he

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:36.829
will surely curse you to your very face despicable they but that carries over to all of us

00:06:37.709 --> 00:06:43.470
that are listening including all of you in the class the devil is convinced in his twisted

00:06:44.269 --> 00:06:52.750
mind that none of us served Jehovah willingly only when things are going well will they

00:06:52.750 --> 00:07:01.310
do what you call your will and we have to determine that we're going to apply the scriptural

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:10.350
advice for example in Psalm 100 and only individuals can do this on an individual basis we stand

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:19.149
before God unless we're talking about toddlers this is our personal responsibility to adhere to

00:07:19.149 --> 00:07:29.949
the scriptures notice Psalm 100 and just the eight part of verse two quite direct served Jehovah

00:07:30.829 --> 00:07:41.790
with rejoicing say served Jehovah with rejoicing so that's just glorifying Jehovah when we serve him

00:07:42.509 --> 00:07:51.550
with rejoicing it infuriates the devil it so be it we want to bring joy to Jehovah's heart now

00:07:52.189 --> 00:08:02.029
in the same letter Paul referred to Paphroditus and so we want to be realistic here because in the same

00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:08.269
letter where we read Philippians four four there he talked about always rejoice he wrote about a

00:08:08.269 --> 00:08:17.629
Paphroditus now Paphroditus fell ill and he became depressed depressed individuals are not known

00:08:17.709 --> 00:08:24.750
for rejoicing so let's be realistic there are times that we're going to face

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:31.709
experiences that are going to cause us to become downhearted and that could be a month from now

00:08:31.709 --> 00:08:39.070
for any one of us it could be a year but it is coming that's the way it is whether the devil is

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:43.870
going to be directly involved or not we don't have to go down that road just life in these last days

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:53.789
makes it difficult to always rejoice if we're not focused on the scriptural counsel Jehovah gives

00:08:53.789 --> 00:08:59.149
because he can change it or give you an example so what do you do I'll turn to Ephesians

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:07.470
and let's read some of the things that are practical that you can do as you face this in the

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:28.340
future Ephesians chapter five and we're advised here verse 15 and 16 to don't be unwise to be wise

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:34.419
making best use of our time well how do you do that well especially when you're be set by all

00:09:34.419 --> 00:09:42.019
sorts of negative emotions or a problem that you're dealing with the be part of verse 18 of chapter

00:09:42.019 --> 00:09:50.659
five keep getting filled with spirit and then verse 19 it's connected with getting filled with

00:09:50.659 --> 00:09:59.299
spirit speak to one another with songs praises to God and spiritual songs singing and accompanying

00:09:59.299 --> 00:10:06.419
yourselves with music in your hearts to Jehovah that's the power of music they can change your

00:10:06.419 --> 00:10:15.940
move it's powerful so we have sacred songs that you face a crisis my suggestion is get your song book

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:20.980
out put whatever device you're having however you're getting the music and change it

00:10:22.179 --> 00:10:30.419
especially of negative emotions are gripping you change it and and really that's a simple thing

00:10:30.419 --> 00:10:36.580
want you to try to remember wherever you are depending on your circumstances if you can't

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:45.299
change your circumstances and sometimes that's the case change your viewpoint don't

00:10:47.299 --> 00:10:52.500
and only you can do that I'm the only one who can change my viewpoint if it's not

00:10:52.980 --> 00:11:02.740
always rejoicing it's up to me individual case by case to make that determined choice now

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:10.500
something that will help because Jehovah doesn't leave us without being equipped very familiar verse

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:21.940
but let's turn to second timothy chapter three one you're very familiar with second timothy

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:33.970
chapter three and you'll see how this is connected with being able to have the skill to change your

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:43.490
viewpoint see verse 16 second timothy 316 all scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching

00:11:44.129 --> 00:11:50.850
for reproving our notice for setting things straight and then for disciplining and righteousness

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:58.289
for setting things straight you notice in the footnote or correcting so when we need to correct

00:11:58.289 --> 00:12:08.210
our viewpoint get your Bible out the scriptures have the power to correct our viewpoint to straighten

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:13.169
it out like nothing else so we can get counselors we can get help we have friends hopefully they're

00:12:13.169 --> 00:12:20.370
using scripture because that's where the power lies the scriptures can change our viewpoint I

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:27.970
like one translator put it for setting things straight for resetting the direction of man's life

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:36.929
for resetting the direction of a man's life so the scriptures have that power and I'll give you an

00:12:36.929 --> 00:12:43.649
idea let's see the class two you have your tablets and it's fine some have hard copy some of the

00:12:43.649 --> 00:12:51.649
tablets it's personal choice but folks that don't know a lot about their phone and how it works

00:12:51.649 --> 00:12:59.009
are the tablets sometimes they get to a point in it it freezes on them what do I do you talk to

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:07.490
the expert and what do they say well have you turned it off lately turn it off and then turn it

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:19.090
back on amazing so get the message you know you can't go four days and you never turn that thing off

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:26.289
and I expect everything to be fine it's just a device so you do turn it off what happened

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:35.490
it reset and they've got a little things that make it reset so the scriptures have that ability

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:46.529
and that power to reset us turn off the negative and all of that pessimistic stuff reset

00:13:47.889 --> 00:13:55.490
with scripture and I'll give you an example of one you can use to do that you'll remember this

00:13:55.490 --> 00:14:02.289
let's go to Luke chapter 10 this is like pushing the reset button the early computers had these

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:08.610
and when I was first starting with them in the early 80s I sure pushed that thing a lot when I

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:17.090
first was trying to learn it you push the reset button here's an account that can actually change

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:23.009
your viewpoint because sometimes and you could do this you know I'm a graduate of Gilly with

00:14:23.009 --> 00:14:31.009
139th class you get to your Simon you're looking for results you want results and that's okay

00:14:32.049 --> 00:14:37.649
have good goals but caution so you can continue to always rejoice

00:14:39.009 --> 00:14:46.610
Jesus had trained his disciples sent him out you find verse 17 of Luke chapter 10 they returned

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:55.169
and why they were rejoicing just demons were made subject to them because of using Jesus name

00:14:55.889 --> 00:15:05.889
Jesus is rejoicing because he sees Satan's demise his future then Jesus gives this profound

00:15:06.769 --> 00:15:14.529
counsel it's nice you had all these good results rejoicing with you but let's read verse 20

00:15:15.169 --> 00:15:23.169
I mean nevertheless do not rejoice because the spirits are made subject to you

00:15:25.009 --> 00:15:33.490
but rejoice because your names have been written in the heavens why that must have just to hear

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:41.649
the master himself say that whoo they got the message see because they weren't always going to be

00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:50.929
able to expel demons have these results so he said to them and I say to you don't let your

00:15:50.929 --> 00:16:03.490
rejoicing depend on results let it depend on your name is written in the heavens see you have

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:15.179
Jehovah's approval see how you can always rejoice reset your thinking your name is written

00:16:16.059 --> 00:16:24.379
in the heavens the powerful yeah but it's true okay now it's quite interesting to me personally

00:16:24.379 --> 00:16:31.659
and just a thought to take with you right after Paul gave the inspired direction to always rejoice

00:16:32.539 --> 00:16:38.539
in the Lord and he said once more I say rejoice what he says after is quite interesting and it's

00:16:38.539 --> 00:16:46.779
connected with being able to continue to always rejoice so let's go back to Philippians chapter 4

00:16:52.059 --> 00:17:06.269
Philippians chapter 4 and right after this was what he wrote notice verse 5

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:15.470
let your reasonableness become known to all men or is that appropriate people that are not

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:27.539
reasonable are very unlikely to be rejoicing very much because they their expectations what they

00:17:27.539 --> 00:17:32.819
expect it's just not reasonable from others and then they'll do it to themselves

00:17:32.819 --> 00:17:42.099
unreasonable expectations of where they should be say thoughts of brother explains excellent talk

00:17:42.099 --> 00:17:48.420
come to my you know always thinking about what you should be or could be it's not reasonable

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:56.740
you're not going to experience rejoicing so Jehovah wants us in fact the inspired Paul to write

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:04.900
another letter to the Romans to have our sacred service rendered to him and he did not say

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:12.339
with your sacred service and your power of emotion it's not what the scripture says power of reason

00:18:14.099 --> 00:18:20.579
is this really a reasonable expectation and I too strict on myself

00:18:21.539 --> 00:18:31.460
beware of that so to always rejoice means be reasonable with yourself see and then enable you to have

00:18:32.019 --> 00:18:42.579
proper goals reasonable goals enable you to always rejoice now there's no doubt in closing here that

00:18:43.299 --> 00:18:50.259
the Christians there in flip by that Paul addressed these thoughts to they were finding joy

00:18:50.339 --> 00:18:58.259
in their service to him because in the third chapter he told him continue rejoicing so that's

00:18:58.259 --> 00:19:18.240
what we say to you in this class always rejoice now and you will rejoice forever well we have

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:26.480
received a lot of greetings from other branches congratulations for the students and here's one from

governing body and the United States battle family dear brothers from the very first day of our

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:10.380
rival you made us feel part of your family you took time out of your busy schedule to get to know

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:17.900
us by your loving example you have taught us how to be self-sacrificing how to show true

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:25.339
hospitality and how to humbly serve the needs of others we have enjoyed every minute being

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:34.380
with you all you have truly become beloved to us concerning the past five months we identify with

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:42.299
the words of prophet Isaiah who wrote oh Jehovah you are our father we are the clay and you are the

00:31:42.299 --> 00:31:50.460
porter yes we feel as though we have been clay vessels in a porter's workshop where Jehovah God

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:58.140
as the porter has been molding our personalities according to his will by digging deep into God's

00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:06.380
word we have felt Jehovah's fingers working on our minds and hearts in the light of Bible truth

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:14.940
Gilead has helped us examine ourselves and enhance our royalties to our God Jehovah and his people

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:22.140
spiritual training has taken us to places in God's word we have never been before

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:28.700
a mountain of gems has been added to our personal storehouse of spiritual treasures

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:40.529
we echo the words of name Maya 218 the good hand of my God was upon me what we have learned

00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:49.809
has truly touched each of us deeply we are now ready to do our part to use what we have learned

00:32:49.809 --> 00:32:54.450
to strengthen and stabilize our brothers and sisters in our respective assignments

00:32:56.450 --> 00:33:05.809
it is our prayer to remain as moldable clay and allow Jehovah to finish our training with one

00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:15.250
voice and with all our heart we want to say thank you to the governing body for inviting us to

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:23.490
Gilead for welcoming us caring for us and training us in every good work it has truly been an

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:34.210
underserved gift from Jehovah all we want to do now is praise Ja keep thanks to Jehovah for his

00:33:34.210 --> 00:34:06.240
good your brothers and sisters of the 139th class of Gilead we certainly appreciate it the spiritual

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:15.039
gems of this graduation program did we not today Jehovah blesses all his servants including the poor

00:34:15.039 --> 00:34:24.000
ones with spiritual prosperity it's just that Proverbs 1022 does not especially refer to it however

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:31.599
the emphasis in the Greek scriptures is on spiritual riches Jesus encouraged to be rich toward God

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:43.789
Luke 1221 or to store up treasures in heaven you Gilead graduates you're not students anymore

00:34:43.789 --> 00:34:52.190
graduates you have a cry at riches spiritual treasures spiritual gems during class did you not

00:34:52.750 --> 00:35:00.909
divine education enables all of us where the students are not to make others spiritually rich as well

00:35:02.269 --> 00:35:08.429
you have the potential to make citizens of your country rich what in whatever country you live

00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:17.150
if they would only let you do it for them most of us of moderate means but we can make many rich

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:23.150
as the Apostle Paul expressed in 2nd Corinthians 610 we recommend ourselves as poor

00:35:23.869 --> 00:35:31.789
materially but making many rich spiritually as having nothing and yet possessing all things

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:39.550
in that sense we are all the richest people in the world and the paradise to come again the blessing

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:47.949
of Jehovah will make all of his servants materially prosper in addition to spiritual prosperity

00:35:49.309 --> 00:36:00.349
we can see that also on the monitors I believe what Jehovah has in store for mankind how thankful we

00:36:00.349 --> 00:36:07.550
are to Jehovah the great provider to bless us not only with material things but also with spiritual

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:15.550
blessings in abundance now and into eternity and we wish all the students of

00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:24.909
students graduates of the 139th class of Gilead Jehovah's rich blessings when you go to your

00:36:24.909 --> 00:36:34.190
assignments to help people to get into the new world into paradise to enjoy the blessings of Jehovah

00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:42.909
so if you agree to give the greetings along also with the students when they go home to their

00:36:42.909 --> 00:37:12.079
assignments so you could express this there was a lot of interest in this program in various locations

00:37:12.079 --> 00:37:22.960

00:37:52.960 --> 00:38:00.960
together well we have reached an all-time peak in the attendance all-time peak of 14491

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:14.460
now if you would like to stand we're seeing the concluding song song number 121

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:27.179
the title is encourage one another 121 and it's under the subject or under the theme

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:39.500
of Hebrews 1024 25 encourage one another song 121 and after this song we have Brother Balthazar
