00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:15.220
Why give attention to the way you introduce the Scripture?

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:22.019
Because the promises of God, which we find in His written Word, have tremendous power.

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:24.780
Hebrews 4.12 says,

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.859
The Word of God is alive and exerts power,

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.660
and is sharper than any two-edged sword,

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.140
and pierces even to the dividing of soul and spirit,

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.539
and of joints from the marrow,

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.140
and is able to discern thoughts and intentions of the heart.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.659
Yes, God's Word has the power to reach a person's heart,

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:52.100
so we should always use it as a basis for our teaching.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.500
But first, we should ensure that our listeners are properly focused on those inspired words.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.659
How might you do that?

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:03.299
Indicate what the text will reveal.

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:05.700
Sight the Bible as God's Word,

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.579
and say something that will make the listeners want to read the verse.

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:16.700
In the following demonstration, see if the speaker accomplishes any of those goals.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.620
Please turn to Psalm 55.22.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.620
Even though we have read this many times before, let's read it again.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.099
Throw your burden on Jehovah, and he will sustain you.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.379
Never will he allow the righteous one to fall.

00:01:35.379 --> 00:01:39.260
Although a kingdom hall audience will likely turn to a scripture,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.379
because you invite them to,

00:01:41.379 --> 00:01:44.980
this audience didn't know why the scripture was being read,

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.659
nor did the speaker give them any reason to be especially interested in what it says.

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.780
How might the speaker properly introduce a Bible verse?

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.219
There are a few ways to do this.

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:01.019
First, he could ask a question that the scripture will answer.

00:02:01.019 --> 00:02:04.060
Let's watch an example of that.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:11.780
When a problem is so severe that it seems you can think of nothing else, what can you do?

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.180
The answer is found at Psalm 55.22.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.580
Or the speaker could pose a problem that the scripture will help to solve.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:31.659
Imagine that your marriagemate or fellow believer has said or done something hurtful to you.

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:38.300
The Bible tells us how not to respond at Romans 12 verses 17 and 18.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.699
Notice what it says.

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:48.539
Another good way to introduce Bible accounts is by stating a principle that the account will illustrate.

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:53.580
We can avoid many problems by following divine instructions.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.860
Please turn to 2nd Samuel chapter 6 verses 2-3-7 and notice what happened

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:07.419
when David didn't follow the proper procedure for transporting the Ark of the Covenant.

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:11.580
What else must we do to introduce scriptures properly,

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.099
especially when our audience includes unbelievers?

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.340
Site God's Word as the authority.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.780
Watch the following demonstration and see if you can discern how the publisher might improve

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.729
in drawing attention to the scripture.

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:32.729
Will crime and wickedness always exist?

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:38.969
David gives us the answer here at Psalm 37, 10 and 11.

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:44.889
The publisher aroused interest in what she was about to read by raising a question.

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:48.810
And she correctly identified David as the writer.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.490
Although it's not wrong to mention the name of the Bible writer,

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.689
in this case, the householder might have wondered who is David.

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:04.650
And even if she knew who David was, she might have viewed his words as an ancient human opinion.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:12.650
Let's see how this sister could introduce this scripture in a way that inspires more confidence in its reliability.

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.009
Will crime and wickedness always exist?

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:23.370
God's Word gives us the answer here at Psalm 37, 10 and 11.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:31.689
So before reading a scripture, do more than simply tell your audience where it can be found and invite them to follow along.

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:38.810
Indicate the key point it will make and say something to make your listeners want to read it.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:46.810
Especially when speaking to unbelievers, introduce the scripture in a way that indicates its authority.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:53.370
By doing these things, you can prepare the minds of your listeners for the important words that you'll read.
