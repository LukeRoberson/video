00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:05.860
We love spending time with people who want to do more in general for service

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.179
Being willing to serve others leads to a life full of blessings. In the late 1970s Linda and I were both assigned as

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:18.260
Special pioneers in Minnesota. That's who we first met. Then I was invited to Gillian

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.100
It was assigned to the Dominican Republic serving at the branch, and that's what we got married and Linda joined me there.

00:00:24.219 --> 00:00:31.620
The Dominican Republic branch was still quite small in those years. So right after we got married our assigned room was the Bethel library.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:38.140
And we were told this is the library so the door needs to be open until nine o'clock at night every night.

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:45.659
So that presented some unique challenges. And that really was a life lesson for us. You really need to keep a good sense of humor.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.340
By nature, I'm pretty shy, but Dominicans are fun and open and very light-hearted.

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:58.939
That was a huge help to me because I learned a lot about how not to take things so seriously.

00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:09.140
And I also learned things that we considered essentials were not essentials. You could live very happily with a lot less. And that was really good training for me.

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:13.939
So after being in the Dominican Republic for a few years, the work was moving forward.

00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:19.579
There was a new branch under construction. It even looked like we were going to have the possibility of having a room with an ocean view.

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:22.060
But all of that was about to change.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:30.049
It certainly was. In 1989, the Berlin Wall fell. And that started a ripple effect.

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:36.890
A lot of the small countries in Eastern Europe were starting to gain independence. And now they were able to have more religious freedom than they ever had before.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:44.890
It was very interesting to us because Mike had family in Albania, which was one of those countries that had been under ban for many years.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:53.370
We thought maybe it might be possible to visit Albania if it wasn't too dangerous for two or three days to meet the family and to reconnect.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.370
It wasn't long after that that we unexpectedly got a letter from the governing body.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.370
And the letter said, we understand you're going to Albania for two or three days.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:07.370
We're wondering if you'd be willing to stay for two or three months and help with the kingdom work.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.370
We were really sure with that meant, but we were willing to try.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.370
The realities of the governing body had very limited information about what was happening in Albania.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.370
The work was under ban. They didn't have a branch. They didn't have a congregation.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.370
Maybe them didn't even know each other were still around.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:29.370
They didn't know if we could find housing there. If we could find food, the country was in a total economic crisis.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.370
Even with all the unknowns, we were still thrilled to go.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:39.370
And we knew, well, it's going to be two or three months. And you can do pretty much anything for two or three months. We're going to give it our best shot.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.370
Of course, once we arrived, we got a better picture. It was really happening.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.370
The infrastructure had actually collapsed. People are scrambling to get a new government up and going. They was quite difficult.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.370
But each assignment that we had prepared us for the next assignment.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:02.370
Having lived in the Dominican Republic where there were already limited resources, it didn't make it as quite as scary.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.370
It made that bridge a little easier for us to cross.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.370
Some of the first things that we had to do was try to see if we could find the old brothers and sisters.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:21.370
It was just a handful of them. And at the same time, we had to try to do what we could to meet with officials and see what could be done to help move the work forward legally.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:31.370
In the process of trying to get the work legalized, unexpectedly we found out that a brother from the United States who had Albanian background was coming to visit his relatives.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.370
And I said to him one day, tomorrow I have a meeting with the ministry who is responsible to give us legalization.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.370
Would you like to come with me? Oh, I'd be delighted, he said.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.370
So we go to the office. When we got to the office, the minister wasn't there, but he said to his legal advisor out.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:53.370
And she made introductions. And then she looked at the brother and she said, were you from? And he said such and such a village.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:04:05.370
And she said, that's my village. It turned out to be that they were cousins. Now she looked everybody and she said, my goodness, I was already willing to help you.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:13.370
Because then it was never a charter that I've read that's better written than yours. But now I have a family obligation.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:25.370
It was just a few days later we got a call and we had the document in our hands. Jehovah's Witnesses of Albania was finally legalized. The ban was lifted after 50 years.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:32.370
After the work was legalized, we just saw Jehovah's Spirit work so mightily. Things were just moving forward in a way that we never expected.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:39.370
They were flooding into the meetings, young people, older people. They were really hungry for the truth.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:48.370
At the end of the three month assignment, the governing body kindly asked us, would you now be willing to stay since the work is legalized?

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:59.000
Well, at this point, those folks had become so dear to our hearts that there was no way that we could leave. We couldn't leave our family and we were thrilled to be able to stay with them.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.000
We ended up serving in Albania just about 30 years and those 30 years went by very quickly.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
We knew that a three day trip would turn into an assignment of a lifetime.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:21.000
When you allow yourself to go outside your comfort zone, you learn a lot about yourself, but you're also more useful to Jehovah. You're also in a better position to help other people.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And that's an opportunity you never want to miss.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And really, never say no to an assignment just because we might be fearful of what the unknown is. When we put ourselves in Jehovah's hands, he's the one that will take on the responsibility to help us.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:46.000
So, put them to the test. Let him help us. He knows where to put us at the right time. And in reality, we're just a pencil in Jehovah's hands letting him do the writing.
