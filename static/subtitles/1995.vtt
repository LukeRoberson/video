00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.219
and introduction to the Book of Romans.

00:00:06.219 --> 00:00:13.220
Romans is placed first in the listing of 21 letters in the Christian Greek scriptures.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:21.710
The Apostle Paul wrote 14 of these letters, including Romans.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.710
Likely in 52 CE, Paul embarked on his third missionary tour.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:34.950
While in Corinth in about 56 CE, Paul wrote to the Christians in Rome,

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.189
a city that he had not yet visited.

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:44.189
The letter to the Romans contains 16 chapters.

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:50.189
In chapter 1, Paul expresses his desire to visit the Christians living in Rome

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:55.189
in order to enjoy an interchange of encouragement.

00:00:55.189 --> 00:01:00.189
He also explains that the world's ungodly conduct is inexcusable

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:05.189
because God's invisible qualities are clearly seen in his creative works.

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.650
Did you know?

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.650
Paul used Tertius as his secretary to write this letter.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.650
The faithful sister Phoebe may have delivered this letter to Rome

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.109
or may have accompanied the person who did.

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:29.109
In chapter 2, Paul highlights God's impartiality.

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:34.109
Both Jews and Gentiles will be judged by the same standard.

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:39.109
In chapters 3 and 4, Paul explains that Jehovah declares Jews

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:44.109
as well as Greeks righteous by faith and he uses the example of Abraham

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:47.109
to illustrate the point.

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:54.109
Abraham lived before the law was given to Moses and before Jesus sacrificed his life.

00:01:54.109 --> 00:02:01.109
Nevertheless, God counted Abraham as righteous because of his outstanding faith.

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:06.109
In chapters 5 and 6, Paul reasons that Adam sinned against God

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:11.110
and as a result, all humans have inherited sin and death.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.110
Relief is possible only through faith in Jesus and his sacrificial death.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:24.110
In chapters 7 and 8, Paul discusses how the mosaic law revealed what sin is

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.870
and why Christians are not under that law.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.870
In chapters 9 and 10, Paul explains that those who exercise faith

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.870
regardless of their nationality can become God's spiritual children.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.870
In chapter 11, Paul uses the illustration of a cultivated olive tree.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.870
Jews who rejected the Messiah are compared to branches that are broken off.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:58.870
Branches from a wild olive tree representing Gentile Christians are grafted in their place.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.870
In order to be part of the tree, all must remain humble and exercise faith in Jesus.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:12.599
In chapters 12 and 13, Paul exhorts Christians to be peaceable with all,

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:16.599
to love one another and to respect governmental authorities.

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:24.039
In chapters 14 and 15, Christians are counseled to stop judging one another

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:28.039
but rather to support those who are weak.

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:35.039
In chapter 16, Paul concludes with words of encouragement and warm personal greetings

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:38.039
mentioning 26 individuals by name.

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:46.139
As you read the inspired letter to the Romans, note how God is impartial

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:48.139
in his dealings with all people.

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:51.139
How Christians should be peaceable with others,

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:57.139
and how freedom from sin and death comes only by exercising faith in Jesus,

00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:59.139
the King of God's kingdom.
