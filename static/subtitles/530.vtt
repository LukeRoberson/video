00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:09.810
So our scripture text for today discusses the qualities needed to walk worthily and in a way that pleases Jehovah.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:16.570
Now, you notice our scripture in scripture text Ephesians 4.1 is only a partial sentence.

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:20.570
Let's read the entire sentence which takes in verses 1 through 3.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.050
Ephesians 4 verses 1 through 3.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:31.609
He says, therefore, I, the prisoner in the Lord, appeal to you to walk worthily of the calling for which you recalled with all humility.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:43.810
And mildness with patience, putting up with one another in love, earnestly endeavoring to maintain the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:52.329
So here the Apostle Paul links walking worthily with unity and you notice the qualities that are needed to do that.

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.450
He says that we need humility, mildness, and patience.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.409
Now, this is not the only time that the Apostle Paul links these three qualities with being in unity.

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:05.730
We may remember Colossians chapter 3 and verse 12.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.730
And it tells us to clothe ourselves with humility, mildness, and patience.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.250
Why so that we can continue putting up with one another?

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.010
So why are these qualities so essential to peace and to unity?

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.689
What would the scriptures say about them?

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.890
Well, perhaps we think of the scripture in Philippians chapter 2, verse 3 and 4, which says,

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.930
do nothing out of contentiousness or egotism, but with humility, consider others superior to you.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:42.170
See, that brings about peace and unity or a proverb, chapter 15 and verse 1, a mild answer turns away rage or proverb,

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:50.810
chapter 25, 15, by patience, a commander is one over the humility, mildness, patience.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:02:01.090
These qualities are so vital for taking tension out of a situation and allowing for humility and for unity and peace.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:09.050
Now, as many accounts in the Bible, they illustrate this fact and we're going to consider just one that of the Ephraimites and Gideon.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:16.370
If you look in your Bibles in Judges chapter 6 and 7, it sets out the account of Gideon going against the Midianites.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:26.569
We remember a response to Jehovah's direction, Gideon went against Midian first with 32,000 men and then finally weeded down to only 300 men.

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:36.449
Now, if you look in your Bibles, the study Bible map B6, it helps us to visualize the strategy that Gideon used with Jehovah's direction.

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:42.969
Now, the Midianites gather near the hill of Maurei and you can see that here on the map.

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:50.289
And if you look at Judges chapter 6 and verse 34, we're reminded that Jehovah's spirit came upon Gideon.

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:52.969
So here he's operating under Jehovah's spirit.

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:54.169
So what did he do?

00:02:54.169 --> 00:03:00.210
First off, he calls on the tribes of Manasseh, Asher, Zebulin and Nathdalai to assist.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.969
And that makes sense because you can see where those tribes were in relation to where the fighting was going to be.

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:12.569
Then in Judges chapter 7, verse 22, Gideon's initial attack through the Midianites into confusion.

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.169
And so the Midianites flee south toward Abomihola.

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:27.250
Verse 23 of chapter 7 says that he then calls on Nathdalai, Asher and Manasseh to chase after them and push them toward the south, further south.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.210
And you can see the logic in that.

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:41.889
But then in an excellent strategy, in verse 24 and 25, to head them off, he also calls on Ephraim to capture the waters as far as Bethbara and block their escape.

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:42.810
And they do.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.169
And they're successful.

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:47.289
The two main princes of Midian are killed.

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:54.250
It's victory, an excellent strategy, one of the greatest and most courageous and bravest battles in the Bible.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:02.330
In fact, interestingly, there's no record ever again of the Midianites bothering Jehovah's people after this victory.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.289
Can you imagine having a share in that project?

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:07.770
How excited you would be?

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.490
Well, not everybody was.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.409
Look at Judges chapter 8 and verse 1.

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:17.370
It says, then the men of Ephraim said to him, to Gideon,

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:19.089
What have you done to us?

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:25.889
Why did you not call us when you went to fight against Midian and they quarreled bitterly with him?

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.689
What was Ephraim's problem?

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:33.329
Well, they felt they should have been involved earlier, or perhaps the situation should have been handled different.

00:04:33.329 --> 00:04:34.610
Why weren't we involved?

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:35.569
Why didn't you call us?

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:37.290
We didn't know anything that was going on.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.889
Then we had to drop everything and come and bail you out.

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:45.649
Well, did Ephraim have humility, maleness, and patience?

00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:49.569
And it was disrupting unity.

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:51.089
Now, how did Gideon respond?

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:58.129
No, remember Gideon had Jehovah's Spirits, and he had an excellent strategy that led to an outstanding victory for Jehovah.

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:59.810
How did he respond?

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.209
Well, look at verses 2 and 3.

00:05:02.209 --> 00:05:04.769
It says, but he said to them,

00:05:04.769 --> 00:05:07.170
What have I done compared with you?

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:12.209
Are not the gleanings of Ephraim better than the great harvest of Abysir?

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:17.730
It was into your hand that God gave Midian's princes Orab and Zia.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.610
And what have I done compared with you?

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.050
When he spoke this way, they calmed down.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.490
You see Gideon showed humility, maleness, and patience.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:35.250
And the result, everyone calmed down and Gideon was able to get on with Jehovah's work at hand.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.889
Now, we contrast that to the next time that the Ephraimites pulled the same trick,

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:42.129
as recorded in Judges chapter 12.

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:48.050
There, you remember they accused Jeptha of not calling them into battle, same story.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.089
What did Jeptha do?

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:51.329
Well, he says, Well, I did call you into battle and you didn't come.

00:05:51.329 --> 00:05:52.529
So I just did it myself.

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:59.009
Next, you know, they're fighting among themselves completely distracted from carrying on Jehovah's work.

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:01.009
What's the lesson?

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:07.170
Well, the lesson is, is that things happen at times that makes peace go away.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:13.009
Sometimes brothers in the congregation at Bethel on a construction site may react like

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:14.449
Ephraimites.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.810
Sometimes we react like Ephraimites.

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.209
But why didn't you ask my opinion?

00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:22.050
I was supposed to be involved in this.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.250
Why'd you call me last minute when you knew you needed this two weeks ago,

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.329
and now I have to drop everything and help you out?

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:28.930
See, that happens.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:29.889
We're only human.

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.050
Well, when it happens, how will we react?

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.250
He's a unity is more important than who was right and who was wrong,

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:45.810
and Gideon understood that simple truth, and unity is so important today.

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:51.009
It was interesting, a beautiful watchtower article, 2014, December 15th,

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:55.490
and the article was entitled, Facing the End of this Old World Together,

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:01.009
and it stated this, it said, one of the darkest periods in human history,

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:06.290
nears. For God's people, it will be a time for unity.

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:10.769
It goes on to say, during the coming time of trouble for this system,

00:07:10.769 --> 00:07:13.410
we will have to be truly united.

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:19.889
So let me ask you, do you think it's any coincidence that here where we are in the

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:25.490
stream of time, that we see Jehovah pulling his organization closer and closer together

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:30.610
in unity? Is it any coincidence that we hear over and over again the need for peace?

00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:36.769
And for unity, no. You see, this world gets more and more divided, fragmented,

00:07:36.769 --> 00:07:41.329
fighting. We need to pull tighter and tighter together in unity.

00:07:41.329 --> 00:07:46.689
And that requires that all of us work on these beautiful qualities of humility,

00:07:46.689 --> 00:07:51.329
mildness, and patience. And when there's a lack of unity, what do we have to do?

00:07:51.329 --> 00:07:58.050
Well, we have to look at ourselves. You see, generally, we find that the problem is me.

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:02.850
It's us. Maybe we weren't consulted as soon as we should have been.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:09.329
Or maybe our idea of how the work or this thing should be done wasn't shared by others.

00:08:09.329 --> 00:08:12.769
But in the grand scheme of things, does it really make a difference?

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:17.649
And many times when we look at a situation afterwards and we pull back unemotionally,

00:08:17.649 --> 00:08:23.410
we generally find that, well, maybe our idea was pretty good, but the timing wasn't good.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:29.490
Or maybe wasn't that great of an idea after all. Or maybe there was more than one way

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:35.409
for this thing to be handled. Or perhaps Jehovah's Spirit was leading things

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:40.929
in a different direction. Well, again, what can help us to not be an obstacle to unity,

00:08:41.649 --> 00:08:46.370
humility, mildness, patience? Just what we're considering in Ephesians chapter 4.

00:08:47.169 --> 00:08:50.850
You see, we have to have the confidence that if it's important to Jehovah,

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:57.889
it'll happen. And if not, what a shame it would be if we become an obstacle to unity

00:08:57.889 --> 00:09:00.850
over something that's not that important to Jehovah.

00:09:02.049 --> 00:09:09.490
You see, brothers and sisters, we need the Gideons to help us in our support of the governing body.

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:13.970
Gideon was such a beautiful example. Once he understood Jehovah's direction,

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:19.730
he was willing to run into the fire for Jehovah and for his organization. That's what we need. We

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:26.450
need Gideons. We don't need anymore Ephremites. So in harmony with today's text,

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:31.889
may each one of us walk worthily in these last days, work on the qualities of humility,

00:09:32.529 --> 00:09:39.649
mildness, and patience. And if we do, we will be a uniting force for good and of Gideon

00:09:39.649 --> 00:09:47.889
like value to Jehovah and the organization in the troublesome days ahead.
