00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:07.259
Knowing that Jehovah is personally involved in preserving and making known his word,

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.259
we can be confident that the Bible is the only true means of drawing close to him.

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.260
As a child, David Sibri from England had not read the Bible.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.260
Instead, he had been taught traditions of men.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
What helped him see the truth?

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.370
I was born in 1930.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:36.369
We lived in Little Hampton, which was a seaside town,

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:41.219
a very pleasant little place, quiet place.

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.219
I would like to walk in the countryside, and they should intrigue me.

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:48.219
My interest was in what I saw rather than what I read.

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:55.219
When 1939, War broke out, and our road became the second line of defense.

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:57.219
And of course, you get the aircraft.

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.219
Well, there was a young boy, young them myself,

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.219
and one Sunday morning, an air raid took place,

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:09.219
and the house where he was living was destroyed, and he was killed.

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:15.219
But I remember saying to my mother, why did he have to die?

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:19.219
And her answer was, well, he's in a better place.

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:21.219
He's with God in heaven.

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:24.219
We didn't quite add up to me.

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:29.219
I couldn't understand how God could be responsible for his death,

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:32.219
which meant he was responsible for war.

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:39.219
So it was a whole thing was depressing, perhaps, but it that way.

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:43.219
As far as religion was concerned, I accepted it was there,

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:47.219
but I couldn't understand how he fitted him or what was going on.

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:52.219
There was a gap somewhere, and I couldn't plug it.

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:56.219
Every time you went to church, you had a hymn book, and a prayer book.

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.219
But a Bible was something you had personally, and the only time I ever opened it,

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.219
was when I began to study with Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.219
I was 17, 18 years of age when I started.

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:13.219
A brother named Joe Gladwin called upon me.

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:15.219
I knew nothing about the Bible.

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:20.219
The fact that he said it very enough, he said it in the Bible, okay.

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:22.219
But what do other people say?

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:25.219
I decided to look for myself.

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:29.219
I realized that what Joe was telling me was right.

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:31.219
But he showed me that the Bible was true.

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:37.219
I began to see that the Bible told me things that I'd never known.

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:42.219
Over the years, I've been privileged to collect so many different translations of the Bible.

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:48.219
Reading through the different translations, it's clear that God's Word never changes.

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:52.219
I got baptized at the age of 20 and 1950.

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:56.219
Over the years, I served first of all as a pioneer.

00:02:56.219 --> 00:03:02.219
From then, I came to Bethel, moving from Bethel to the circuit and district work,

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:06.219
and then finally, coming back to Bethel for the writing desk.

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:10.219
The assignments I've had have strengthened my conviction,

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:14.219
not only that Jehovah is giving direction,

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:18.219
and His Spirit can enable us to do whatever He wants us to do,

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:25.219
but the organization has grown and with the development of the governing bodies direction,

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:29.219
is an organization which is second to none,

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:34.219
and therefore staying with it is the logical thing to do.

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:39.219
In my life, I looked in many places for answers to life's questions,

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:42.219
but only the Bible has provided answers.

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:47.219
I am so thankful that Jehovah continues to teach us.
