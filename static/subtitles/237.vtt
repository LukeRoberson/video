00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:11.980
As part of the signs of the time of the end, Jesus said that there would be food shortages and earthquakes in one place after another.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.980
But He said, all these things are just the beginning of the pangs of distress.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:32.979
Now as proof of Jesus sign on March the 15th, that was a Friday, Cyclone died down tons of water in an area spanning from Zimbabwe, Malawi and through to Mozambique.

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:40.979
Now as a branch, we were asked to give relief supplies aid to Mozambique.

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:52.979
And so we'd like to provide a report of what has been accomplished so far and at the same time just share the response of some of the businessmen that we have dealt with.

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:59.979
The area that was affected to a very large extent for Mozambique was Byra.

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:15.980
Now this map, we can see a view, a picture here, shows how much water was left behind in Byra and the inland regions creating ocean-like bodies of water.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:23.980
Now many had to be rescued and they still being rescued from trees and small outcrops of land.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.980
There they tried to obtain some refuge from the water.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:39.980
Now it's estimated that as many as 10,000 of our brothers and sisters have been affected due to approximately 90% of the buildings being destroyed.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:50.980
There's an urgent need for shelter and the Mozambique branch has already sent a small quantity of tents to begin the relief effort.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.980
So Africa branch began providing support with relief supplies just over a week ago.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:06.980
The two locations that we are supplying to are Shamoya to the west and Byra, which is the fourth largest city of Mozambique.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:19.979
So our support began on Sunday March the 17 when satellite phones were purchased and sent to Byra to allow the branch in Mozambique to have direct contact with the brothers.

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:32.979
Then on Monday March the 18th we began compiling a shopping list of items and of course this was all under the direction of the disaster relief desk, the branch committee of Mozambique and the coordinators committee.

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:39.979
So we began sourcing items for urgent shipment to these two locations.

00:02:39.979 --> 00:03:03.979
Now what was included? Well there were 253 tents in Topolins, Lifejackets, 103,000 packs of biscuits, 1,000 and 5 cases of bottled water, 40 tons of millimeal, 200 pots, 2,000 mosquito nets,

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:19.979
40,000 tons of fish, hundreds of miscellaneous safety equipment, hundreds of miscellaneous cooking and cleaning utensils and of course medication and other equipment as well.

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:29.979
Now buyers from the purchasing department went and visited supplies and bought up as much of their stock as we could.

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:39.979
The first truckload left on Thursday morning, March the 21st to Chamoya despite that actually being a public holiday.

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:55.979
Then during the course of Thursday buyers managed to secure stocks of items and then between shipping, purchasing, transportation, brothers and sisters collected these all over Johannesburg and Pretoria.

00:03:55.979 --> 00:04:05.979
Now when buyers travel to suppliers and shop managers explaining what we were doing, they actually went out of their way to assist us.

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:21.980
For example, when a buyer visited one store and explained to one of the key staff that what we were doing is to assist our fellow worshipers in devastated areas, he was moved to become our personal shopper.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:39.980
Anything we wanted, he checked his stock, he even loaded this onto trolleys for us, he got four of his staff to help us through checkout, they loaded it onto trolleys and this personal shopper assisted loading this onto buckets.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.980
Then the manager came out and he agreed to give us a discount of 9%.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:05:05.980
Now when a buyer contacted a supply to purchase water purification kits, he agreed to meet us at his premise on the public holiday and to give us the stock we needed, even though we had no dealings with him previously, he agreed that we could take the items and pay later.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:18.980
So Thursday evening there was a lot of activity here, all these items were received in, they were wrapped, they were prepared for sending and on Friday morning the next full truckload left for Shamoa.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:33.980
Now when we updated the branch in Mozambique on Thursday evening with photographs and the progress of the buying, packing and shipping of these supplies, one brother from the purchasing department responded,

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:44.980
thank you so much, you brothers are making me cry, only Jehovah's people can do this, we love all of you, thank you.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:06:03.220
Now due to all road access to buyer being closed, we needed to send items by air, at first the quotation given by the airline was extremely high, so we appealed to them and asked them to consider lowering their charge to support the relief effort.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:20.220
And to our amazement, the airline reduced the cost by 75%. And we were told that if we could get items to them within an hour, they would start including this on the flight leaving the same day.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:33.220
Well, even though our items arrived 30 minutes late after the flight was scheduled as closed, the airline pleaded with a pilot and we were able to get some items onto that flight as well.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:48.220
Then on Friday morning, a second truck was dispatched to Chenuea, a third truck was packed in preparation for sending on Monday morning, and addition to this the second air freight of much needed food and water was sent on Saturday morning.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:07:03.220
This week, a load of medical equipment, blankets and medication will be sent to both locations, and further truckloads of food and emergency items will be sent by truck as they become available for shipping.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:12.220
But we want to thank the family for their interest, their care, their prayers in behalf of our most in big brothers and sisters.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:22.220
We also appreciate the support of the shipping, export, transportation, accounting, food services and purchasing departments.

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:28.220
Yes, in working shoulder to shoulder, responding quickly and effectively to meet this need.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:33.220
Many of you worked well into the night and over the weekend.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:41.220
The spirit shown by everyone is well described in 2 Corinthians chapter 8 verses 3 and 4.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.220
There we read 2 Corinthians 8.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:08:02.220
For it was according to their means, yes, I testify, it was even beyond their means, while they on their own initiative kept earnestly begging us for the privilege of kindly giving to have a share in the Reef Ministry of the Holy Ones.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:10.220
Brothers, we do not know the full impact of the destruction that was caused.

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:15.220
That is yet to be established. Much work still lies ahead.

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:28.220
So thank you all for the excellent fine work done, and may we all continue to keep these brothers in our prayers, as well as our brothers in Zimbabwe and Malawi.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:34.220
Yes, as these brothers are assisted through this horrific disaster.
