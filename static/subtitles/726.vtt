00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:08.849
Today, it's a privilege to address you a very precious group of people.

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.730
Your journey to this day has not been an easy one.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:19.089
But in this talk, we want to focus on a specific journey, the one that began when you were invited

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:24.089
to Gilead up to your first day in class.

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:29.250
Due to the lockdown, that journey brought you unexpected trials, unknown to previous

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.809
classes of Gilead.

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:37.170
Along the way, you said many prayers and even shed some tears.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.689
But instead of giving into despair, we're so proud of you, you became stronger.

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:50.530
Your journey can be compared to the journey of a Levite, as described in Psalm 84.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:59.270
So, let's open our Bibles to Psalm 84, and we're going to review the man's musings, as

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.670
he traveled from his home to Jehovah's Temple, Psalm 84.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.709
And as we do, we will learn what it means to find strength in Jehovah, and what will

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:16.150
help you to continue to go from strength to strength.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:27.030
So we can begin at verse 5, happy are the men who find their strength in you.

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:29.590
Now, what does this mean?

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.069
To find strength means you have to be looking for it.

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:37.349
So we look to Jehovah for strength.

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:39.150
How do we do that?

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.430
We do that by prayer and focus.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:50.790
When we pray, we pray that Jehovah for his Holy Spirit and focus on him, he gives

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.750
us strength.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.510
Now at first, this strength may be just enough to start a difficult journey, such as you

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.989
started when you received your invitation to Gilead.

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:07.349
But as the journey continues, you become stronger.

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:11.789
If you take the right approach, well, what is that approach?

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:18.080
Well, let's read on, and we'll go to verse 6.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.240
When they pass through the Bake of Alley, they make it into a place of springs, and

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.800
the early rain closes it with blessings.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.759
There were many routes to travel to get to Jerusalem, but this Levite speaks of traveling

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:38.080
through the Bake of Alley.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.360
That's not the scenic route.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.080
The Bake of Alley was a dry, desolate, parched area.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.800
In fact, the word Bake comes from a Hebrew word to weep.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.039
It seems that the Bake of Plant exuded a type of milky sap, giving the appearance of

00:02:55.039 --> 00:03:00.280
tears which added to the gloominess of this parched land.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.639
There may also have been literal tears as shed as ones made their long journey to Jerusalem.

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:15.039
But notice, notice what this Levite was able to do as he walked through this valley.

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:21.599
Every says in verse 6, they make it into a place of springs, and the early rain closes

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.400
it with blessings.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:31.039
You see, this Levite was so focused on the joy he would have worshipping at the temple

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:37.000
that as he walked through the dry, desolate, Bake of Alley, this scenery along the way

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.199
looked attractive to him.

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:45.439
He was able to look at this dried up valley with eyes of faith and make it into a place

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:48.000
of water springs.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Now how was that possible?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.560
Well, it's like when a brother once described his trip to the house of a sister he was

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.080
courting.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:04.840
It involved getting on, dirty buses, crowded subways, walking past, dingy apartments, but

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:13.479
to him the whole trip was a beautiful scene because it was taking him to visit her.

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:20.560
Similarly, the Levite of Psalm 84 could see past the gloominess around him and see Jehovah's

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.879
blessings ahead.

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:29.240
He was energized by thinking about his privilege of actually serving at Jehovah's Temple.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.360
To the point where even the Bake of Alley was beautiful to him.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.680
Because it led to the place he most wanted to be.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.959
And with that in focus, notice what happens.

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:47.819
Let's read verse 7.

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:52.699
They will walk on from strength to strength.

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:58.500
Each one appears before God in Zion.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.100
Now what does that mean?

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.540
Strength to strength.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:07.899
Although the Levite may have entered the Valley of Tears weak, under the weight of his problems,

00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:12.920
love for true worship fueled every step taken.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:18.459
He knew his service would be noticed by Jehovah, who would bless his whole soul's effort

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:20.660
to serve him.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.819
That was the initial strength from Jehovah he had.

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:32.500
But when he finally arrived at the temple, the joy of actually appearing

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:39.620
before Jehovah God, that joy, and having his approval and blessing empowered him, it

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:48.300
energized him to walk from strength that Jehovah initially gives to even greater strength.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:58.110
In other words, it made him an even stronger person than he was before beginning the journey.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.790
Now for you students, your journey to Gilead was different from others.

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:07.110
You did not take the scenic route.

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:13.430
But in Jehovah's strengths, you were able to look beyond the four walls of quarantine,

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:19.149
beyond the lockdown, beyond the start of class being postponed.

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:25.269
You looked beyond the dry, parched ground of the Baker Valley, and you saw Jehovah's blessing

00:06:25.269 --> 00:06:31.829
on his people as the governing body, gave faithful and discreet direction to the worldwide

00:06:31.829 --> 00:06:32.829
brotherhood.

00:06:32.829 --> 00:06:33.829
You were right here.

00:06:33.829 --> 00:06:37.189
You watched it personally.

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:42.589
So though you may have arrived here weakened by your personal trials, after walking through

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:51.149
your figurative bake a valley in Jehovah's strength, you came out stronger, ready to appear

00:06:51.149 --> 00:06:58.269
to appear before Jehovah God, to be trained by his organization.

00:06:58.269 --> 00:07:05.790
And then it was finally announced the school would start in August.

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:12.509
And I remember, I remember the day when you walked into the classroom for the first time,

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:18.350
and you sat in your seats, and you opened up your student binder, you put your Bible on

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:27.550
the desk, and as you looked up, your eyes revealed, I made it to my journey.

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:35.550
And class began, day after day, and it is noteworthy that in Jehovah's strength, not one

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:42.189
of you, not one of you missed a day of class, that is to your credit, you wanted to learn

00:07:42.189 --> 00:07:45.910
every day you took advantage of every opportunity.

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:50.350
Thank you for the zeal that you showed.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:56.550
So yes, remember the lessons from class, we know you will.

00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:00.870
But also remember the lesson from your journey.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:07.790
As you take on new assignments in the future, see past the challenges along the way, see

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:15.470
past the disappointment, see past the tears, turn your bake a valley into a spring, and

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:18.949
you will become stronger for it.

00:08:18.949 --> 00:08:22.389
And you can do this through prayer.

00:08:22.389 --> 00:08:27.670
You can do this by praying for Jehovah, praying to Jehovah for his spirit and focusing on

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:28.670
him.

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:35.309
And remember the end goal is not the assignment in itself.

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:41.509
The assignment is just a means to experience your real goal of having and maintaining

00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:44.029
Jehovah's blessing.

00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:50.070
If you prayerfully keep that in focus, Jehovah will completely change your outlook regarding

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:53.309
the challenges in front of you.

00:08:53.309 --> 00:08:56.110
The parched land becomes streams of water.

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:59.269
The tears of pain become tears of joy.

00:08:59.269 --> 00:09:05.070
You will see Jehovah make you walk on from strength to strength.

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:11.950
From the initial strength Jehovah gives to becoming an ever stronger servant of his.

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:18.029
He will empower you not only to walk through the valley of hardships, but you will be that

00:09:18.029 --> 00:09:22.350
much ready for whatever work lies ahead.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:29.149
You will be in a much better position to appear before Jehovah, your God, and enjoy his

00:09:29.149 --> 00:09:31.309
favor.

00:09:31.309 --> 00:09:38.389
So in conclusion, take the bake a valley route through all your challenges.

00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:43.789
There's a wise saying, a calm sea never made a good sailor.

00:09:43.789 --> 00:09:49.950
Likewise, don't trade hardships for comfort because you will feel a closeness to your heavenly

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:55.870
father in a way that you never would have experienced if you hadn't walked from strength

00:09:55.870 --> 00:10:16.269
to strength through the valley of Baker.
