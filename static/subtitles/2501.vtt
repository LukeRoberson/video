00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:12.310
I can't do this.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.310
How's your talk coming?

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.310
Terrible.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.309
Maybe someone else could do this.

00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:19.309
Hmm.

00:00:19.309 --> 00:00:22.989
Do you remember what Jehovah's name means?

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:25.309
He causes to become?

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:26.309
Yes.

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:30.149
He can become anything he needs to get great things done.

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:35.109
And he can also help others to become what he wants them to be.

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:37.109
Think about it.

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:39.109
Jehovah is the creator.

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:42.109
Think of all the animals he's made.

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:43.109
Huh?

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:44.109
Wow.

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:53.460
Wow, that's a big whale.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.060
He created our universe.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:05.900
Look at all the planets he made.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:15.950
He makes sure everything has what he needs to grow.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.109
Jehovah can make us powerful too.

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:20.109
Look at Moses.

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:25.950
He took a shine man and used him to split the Red Sea.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.189
If he can do all of that, do you think he can help you pronounce hard names and get prepared

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.189
for your talk?

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:34.189
Yeah.

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:41.959
But of course, to receive his help, you have to ask him for it.

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:44.680
His name was Mavivicheth.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.920
The sons of Raman, the Bierra Thine, Rekath.
