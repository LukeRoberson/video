WEBVTT

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:06.679
Well, we have many fine examples of those who have maintained their focus during extreme

00:00:06.679 --> 00:00:08.679
life events.

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:14.039
But consider the experience of Felix and Myra Tarazas and the following prerecorded

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:15.039
interview.

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:22.140
Well, it's a privilege to be with Felix and Myra Tarazas serving at Wal-Kill.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.019
We understand it's been a very difficult year.

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.059
Could you share some of the details of your medical condition?

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:32.859
Well, about a year and a half ago, I started developing an infrequent

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:37.659
pain in my chest, which led me to seeing several doctors.

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:43.179
Soon thereafter, I was diagnosed with a malignant tumor that was only going to be

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:46.539
treatable by its complete removal.

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:51.179
After the surgery, we were hoping to hear good news moving forward.

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:55.979
Then a few weeks later, one of my doctors conveyed to us some of the most

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:02.380
difficult words that one can imagine hearing, a life expectancy of just a few

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.380
months.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.379
Wow.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.859
That had to have been difficult to hear.

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:09.260
How were you able to get your mind wrapped around that?

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:15.459
Well, as you can imagine, after many intense and tearful prayers asking Jehovah to give

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:23.459
us a piece of mine to give us a comb heart and wisdom to make a good decision, we decided

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:29.260
on a treatment to hospice care that would allow me to make the most of the time that I had

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:35.340
left and to be able to give my very best to Jehovah.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.780
That's remarkable Felix.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.500
And my, you're such a supportive wife.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.340
How have you been able to be so positive?

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.579
I have to say it's my hope in Jehovah.

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.620
That is what's helped me.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.939
At the moment, we're sharing in the sufferings mentioned the 2nd Corinthians 1, 7.

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.900
But the verse concludes we will also share in the comfort.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.659
And we are also experiencing that right now.

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.299
I have no doubt I'll see Felix again at the resurrection.

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:10.539
When I look to the future, I can vividly picture us walking through the paradise earth, enjoying

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.340
Jehovah's beautiful creation.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.099
This is the life, the real life Jehovah promises.

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.460
And it's this hope that gives me joy and peace.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.460
Beautifully expressed.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.620
Thank you.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.860
And Felix, how have you been able to be so joyful?

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.539
My relationship with Jehovah has never been stronger than it is right now.

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:39.180
And I believe it's this closeness and this intimacy with him that is providing me the

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.860
joy that I'm experiencing.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:49.300
Now Philippians 4, 6, and 7 assures me that by prayer and by supplication, it says that

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.340
the peace of God will guard your hearts.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.460
Prayer has been so indispensable in bringing me peace during this process.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.500
And it's also amplified my appreciation for the resurrection like I have never experienced

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.340
before.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.099
Proverbs 12.25 I think perfectly illustrates our current situation.

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:16.340
There it says, anxiety in a man's heart can weigh it down.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.860
But a good word says it cheers it up.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:27.680
Both my and I and I have benefited from what we feel is an enormous storehouse of good

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.180
words received in the way of concern, of love and compassion from the brotherhood.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.860
And lastly, my current circumstances have opened up such a wonderful opportunity to share

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:47.020
kingdom truths with family members, including the beautiful privilege of being able to study

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.699
the Bible with my mother during the past few months.

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:52.860
Oh, amazing.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.780
Tell us, how is this experience affected your faith and trust in Jehovah?

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.939
Well, we have seen Jehovah's hand from the very beginning, but one time sticks out

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:04.699
in my mind.

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:08.500
It was the day we received Felix's prognosis.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.379
That evening, the Bethel family watched our study, considered the article, keep calm

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.419
and trust in Jehovah.

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:22.339
And this was followed by a lecture entitled, remain in Jehovah's everlasting arms.

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:27.860
Jehovah provided us exactly what we needed to hear that very day.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:35.139
We felt it was an answer to our prayers as if to reassure us he has everything under control.

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:39.980
This has strengthened my faith in that Jehovah will continue to more than super abundantly

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.939
provide for us care and guidance as we face new challenges.

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:50.509
And without a doubt, fulfill his promises for the future.

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:55.629
I think when you come to understand that you only have a short time to live, you know,

00:04:55.629 --> 00:05:00.350
that's something that can very easily knock you right off of your feet.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.910
But we know that we have been grasped by Jehovah's carrying hands right now.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.750
And that is what stabilized us.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:15.230
You know, throughout this ordeal, we have seen Jehovah's love, his care and assistance

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:21.550
in every decision and every step that we've taken from the first visits to the doctors

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:28.509
through surgery and into the most difficult part of the prognosis, we have lacked nothing.

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:36.709
I absolutely know that my faith has only been strengthened by the challenges of this trial.

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:44.069
So now, as I prepare to close my eyes and fall asleep for just a brief time, it is a privilege

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:50.990
for me to demonstrate to Jehovah my trust in all of his promises and to maintain complete

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.069
integrity right down to the end.

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:58.110
What an outstanding expression of faith.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:04.629
Thank you both so much for sharing those deeply personal and motivating expressions.

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:10.629
You are a living example of faith in action and we love you.

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:16.069
I can't tell you how many times I've seen that and it's so moving each time.

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:22.629
On June the 8th, 2021, a dear brother Felix went to sleep in death just seven weeks after

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:27.550
this interview and any, frankly, that was around the terraces during this time.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:34.430
You would see firsthand the power of faith and their focus and wanting to give Jehovah

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.509
their absolute best.

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:38.189
It was true.

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:43.629
Myra, the dear Myra continues to show that same faith and endurance even now.

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:48.550
And Felix's mother, she's continued to progress spiritually we understand.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.069
Felix will be so happy to hear.
