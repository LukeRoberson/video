00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:07.839
To seek first the kingdom and God's righteousness demands that Christians make

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:22.780
specific choices in life. Money, in most lands, it is a necessity and it can

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:44.500
serve as a protection. However, what priority should it be given? It is vital

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.979
that spiritual pursuits take first place in life. But how can one do that when

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:59.969
the pressures of daily life become more and more demanding? To find the balance

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.170
between our material and spiritual needs is to find true happiness and

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:51.579
satisfaction. So you coming to the gathering tonight? I've been looking forward to

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:57.500
all week. Everyone will be there. Oh the gathering. I can't. My parents invited

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.219
brother Timothy for dinner. They planned it weeks ago. Julius, you promised.

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.659
Lydia, I want to come. Believe me. But I... This is so typical for you, Julius.

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.939
Always trying to make a good impression when the overseer is here. What are you trying

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:15.180
to prove? I'm not trying to prove anything. Then come. Who would you rather

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.900
disappoint? Brother Timothy or your friends?

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.020
Forget it. Sisters, let's go. Julius obviously is a bit confused right now.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:37.659
When Timothy leaves, he'll be himself again. We'll be there if you decide to come, Julius.

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:41.419
Excuse me, friends. Hello, Julius.

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:44.860
Have your parents left? I'm sorry, brother Timothy. What did you say?

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.539
Have your parents gone home already? Yes. They went ahead and prepared dinner.

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:54.699
They really enjoy your visits, brother Timothy. Coming back to Ephesus is like coming home for me.

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:58.219
Julius, is something wrong? Excuse me, brother Timothy.

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:02.780
Something's weighing on your mind. No, I'm fine. Could I have something to do with

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.580
your friends who just left? Oh, them? No. They don't bother.

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:13.819
Well, yes, I guess you're right. They were talking about, well, about the way act

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.740
when you're around. What I see is a young man who is progressing well in the truth.

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:23.099
Exactly. It seems that way. When you're here, your influence is so strong.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.020
And when you go, there's so much pressure to what everyone else is doing.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:33.180
Hmm, I see. It's like my heart is torn in two. I have spiritual goals,

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.340
but I can't seem to stay focused. Higher learning, the games,

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:43.740
and girls, I seem to lose my way. You probably don't understand the word I just said.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.500
Perhaps I do understand. There was a time in my life when I think I was very much like you.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.620
How could that be? You're a pillar among the congregations.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.939
I didn't really become fully involved in my ministry until I was a little older than you are now.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.460
Growing up, I was pulled in two different directions. I always thought of myself as a Jew because

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.580
of my mother and grandmother, but my father was Greek. I never felt like a real Jew.

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:13.099
I was too timid at times to tell my father how I really felt. You timid?

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.620
And when I had to explain to my father that I wanted to become a Christian,

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.259
and later that I wanted to serve Jehovah more fully, I was frightened even thinking about

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:24.060
having to face up to him. How did you deal with the pressure?

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.579
Let me tell you about some of the events that changed my life.

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:34.430
It was more than 20 years ago back in my hometown, Listera.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.750
The Jews had just stoned the Apostle Paul. My mother, Eunice, and my grandmother, Lois,

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.149
had embraced the Christian faith, and I had to make some difficult decisions.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:29.089
We took the Apostle Paul into our home and cared for his wounds. I knew the Christian course

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:58.560
wasn't popular, but I'd never seen anything like this. Paul, please promise me that you'll be more

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:06.240
careful. A lot of people still want to hurt you and your wounds. Shall I dress them again?

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:12.160
My dear Eunice, you've done enough. You know we must enter into the kingdom of God through many

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:21.180
tribulations. Timothy, we haven't heard a word out of you. Brother Paul, what can I say?

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:27.740
I've never seen such an angry crowd. They went from helling you and brother Barnabas' gods

00:07:28.459 --> 00:07:34.300
to beating you and leaving you for dead. But then you got up and went right back into the city

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:39.500
and you, brother Barnabas. My son, the power beyond what is normal is not out of ourselves.

00:07:40.139 --> 00:07:45.100
Jehovah supplies it. Brothers, we've prepared some food for your journeys.

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:50.699
Thank you, sisters. Is it ready? Yes, come with me. We'll pack it up.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:58.110
Brother Paul, I'm curious. How should I put this?

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:05.709
Do you have any regrets? Regrets? No, my son.

00:08:06.509 --> 00:08:12.189
Even in my darkest moment, I have never regretted my choice to give up worldly fortune and fame.

00:08:13.069 --> 00:08:19.629
It was useless. I considered as mere refuse. I only regret not having given it up sooner.

00:08:19.629 --> 00:08:26.350
Yet, look at what you've lost. No, look at what I've gained. For 13 years, I have enjoyed

00:08:26.509 --> 00:08:32.590
the privilege of strengthening our brothers. I've held new congregations. I've seen crowds of

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:41.149
disciples everywhere turning to the Lord. Regrets? No, Timothy. I have no regrets. Not even after

00:08:41.149 --> 00:08:49.070
enemies of the truth beat you mercilessly, Timothy, do you consider Jesus to be a model for us to

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:56.509
imitate? Of course. Before coming to this earth, what was his position? He was God's master

00:08:56.509 --> 00:09:02.990
worker. Happy before God all the time. And then what? He delivered us from sin and death.

00:09:03.789 --> 00:09:10.669
Right. But not before giving up everything and becoming a slave. He was viewed as a despicable

00:09:10.669 --> 00:09:18.429
blasphemer in a cursed criminal worthy of death. Was all of that in vain a failure? Of course not.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:25.710
So self-sacrifice results in great gain. Does it not? It's not a life wasted.

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:30.909
It's a life lived to the full. It's a life lived with the only worthwhile purpose.

00:09:31.549 --> 00:09:39.470
But Jesus was God's son. In his purpose was so noble. That's true. But is our purpose any less

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:46.429
noble when compared to the mold this world tries to squeeze us into? What are the nations eagerly

00:09:46.429 --> 00:09:54.029
pursuing? Prominence, glory, athletes gain great fame and a great deal of money. Fine.

00:09:54.909 --> 00:10:00.909
Let me test your memory. What was the name of the runner who won the sprint race at the Olympics?

00:10:00.909 --> 00:10:05.710
The year that Alexander, the king of Macedonia, attended the games. How would anyone know that?

00:10:06.509 --> 00:10:11.309
Do you remember then who was crown champion at the wrestling contest 40 years later?

00:10:12.269 --> 00:10:18.590
I have no idea. Isn't that interesting? They trained hard. They sacrificed certain

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:24.750
pleasures in life. They won their cherished prize. And yet you can't recall their names.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:32.350
Now, let me ask you, what was the name of someone who as a little boy began serving at Jehovah's

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:38.350
Tabernacle? Now that's easy. Samuel. And what about the young woman who was a queen in Persia

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:43.389
and put her life in danger for Jehovah's people? That's not difficult either. Esther, the cousin of

00:10:43.389 --> 00:10:51.070
Mordecai. Why do you remember those names? Because they're in the Holy writings. Yes. But why are they

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:59.629
there? What do Samuel and Esther have in common? They were devoted to God. And they were self-sacrificing.

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:06.350
Would you say that their life of self-denial led to failure? Failure?

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:10.269
No. I'm certain that their names are written in the book of life.

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:15.710
Whatever they sacrificed to serve Jehovah, do you think it was worth it?

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:22.990
I think I see your point, Brother Paul. So if we use the sisters that prepared more provisions

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:32.210
in you and I will ever need. My dear sisters, we will always remember your hospitality and love.

00:11:32.769 --> 00:11:42.460
I've loved enough prayers go with you, Paul. My son, remember what we discussed. I won't forget it.

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:57.309
That night I made it my determination to put Kingdom interests first in my life.

00:11:57.309 --> 00:12:17.169
I like this. The next day at the marketplace, I wanted to share this good news with my best friend, Jonathan.

00:12:18.129 --> 00:12:22.929
Then Paul asked me, do you remember who the little boy was who began serving in the Tabernacle in Israel?

00:12:22.929 --> 00:12:26.929
And right then I was still who he was trying to teach me. Even I know he's talking about Samuel.

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:33.250
True. But that wasn't the point. Samuel and others made a name with Jehovah and they will always

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:39.889
stand as examples for us. They truly had fulfilling lives in Jehovah's service. For men like Samuel,

00:12:39.889 --> 00:12:45.169
it wasn't about selfish pursuits. It was about self-sacrifice. So what are you getting at?

00:12:46.049 --> 00:12:50.049
Ever since we got baptized, I've seriously been considering my future.

00:12:50.049 --> 00:12:54.210
Don't you think I know that? We've always had long talks about this if we were children.

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:57.090
Yes, but now I finally am focused on the goals I want to pursue.

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:01.090
I want to use my life to the fulling God's service. Wait a minute.

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:08.129
You've always been focused. I mean, we've always been focused. Our goal has been to go to school

00:13:08.129 --> 00:13:13.730
together in Athens. What suddenly changed that? My conversation with Paul has made me re-examine my

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:18.289
priorities. Ever since he became a Christian, Paul has used his life to honor God.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.409
I can't get over how happy he is with the decisions he's made.

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:25.889
I want to be just as happy as he is. I want to serve God too, Timothy.

00:13:26.929 --> 00:13:31.809
But there's goals I want to achieve first. Education, marriage. There's nothing wrong with those

00:13:31.809 --> 00:13:38.049
plans. But maybe we should be reaching out for spiritual goals first. Why? What's the rush?

00:13:38.049 --> 00:13:42.370
We have our whole lives ahead of us. I know, Jonathan. What's your father going to say?

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:49.409
You don't even want to tell him, do you? I am going to tell him tonight, in fact.

00:13:49.409 --> 00:13:55.330
Remember when we were younger? We used to talk all the time about going to school at Athens together.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:14:01.090
Learning at the feet of the masters, establishing a profitable business. Maybe even moving our families

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:07.330
to Ephesus. Those were our goals. And they're still a part of me that wants that. For both of us.

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:11.330
But I also want to honor Jehovah by doing all I can in his service.

00:14:11.889 --> 00:14:15.009
You could do both. Lead a normal life and preach.

00:14:16.129 --> 00:14:23.490
Timothy, look around you. There are great opportunities ahead. Look at this prosperous nation.

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:27.730
Yes, look at this nation. And see how many need to hear the good news.

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:34.129
Timothy, I love you like a brother. But this isn't going to change my goals.

00:14:35.649 --> 00:14:38.210
Next month, I'm leaving for Athens, whether you come with me or not.

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:44.500
I can no longer ride in the faith of my mother and grandmother. I know what I must do.

00:14:48.299 --> 00:14:54.000
God's blessing, Timothy. You have to go. Be well.

00:14:54.799 --> 00:15:06.379
You too, Jonathan. That was difficult.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:10.779
But it was nothing compared to what I had to face next.

00:15:11.419 --> 00:15:21.600
Did you say that, you? Yes, mother.

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:31.389
Did you get the provisions? Well, not really.

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:33.389
Are you okay, son?

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:37.309
I told Jonathan that I want to do more in God's service.

00:15:37.309 --> 00:15:38.590
Well, that's wonderful.

00:15:39.149 --> 00:15:44.669
No, you don't understand. Jonathan didn't think it was wonderful. It was almost as if he felt

00:15:44.669 --> 00:15:49.309
betrayed. I'm sorry, Timothy. That must have disappointed you.

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:53.389
But he has to make his own decision about serving God more fully.

00:15:54.269 --> 00:15:59.870
You know, that's not going to be easy. Not everyone will encourage you to pursue Christian goals.

00:16:00.669 --> 00:16:05.870
No, not everyone. But he is one of my best friends. Surely he should understand.

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:07.070
What a day.

00:16:08.269 --> 00:16:12.350
Your father is here. It might be time to tell him of your desire as well.

00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:17.789
Say a prayer, son, for courage. I'm going to go and finish the meal.

00:16:30.799 --> 00:16:36.480
Ah, hello, Timothy. Hello, father. The marketplace was packed today.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:40.000
The Roman Garrison brought so much business.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.320
Hmm, something smells good.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.000
I'm home, Eunice.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.840
So tell me, son, how was your day? Excellent, father.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.039
You must share with me, then.

00:16:50.799 --> 00:16:54.399
The talk in the market today was about that preacher, Paul.

00:16:55.919 --> 00:16:58.799
No one can believe he returned to the city after what happened.

00:17:00.559 --> 00:17:04.880
Among his many faults, he is a courageous man. I would say so.

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:11.839
This I cannot believe. Here's a man from a prominent family who had a good education for a Jew.

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:17.519
He has the rare talent to become somebody, but look at him. He's reviled.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:23.359
I will never understand a man like that. But you, my son.

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:29.519
I want you to enjoy a good life and to take over the family business.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.319
Thank you, father.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:38.559
You're gifted, intelligent. There's never been a better time for a young man like you.

00:17:39.519 --> 00:17:44.240
Use your talents to get ahead in the world. Father, now that you mention it,

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:48.400
yes, I say it, Timothy. Speak your mind.

00:17:49.039 --> 00:17:51.359
I, uh, I need to tell you something.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.720
Yes, tell me about your day. Wait, this doesn't have anything to do with that man, Paul, does it?

00:17:59.119 --> 00:18:00.400
No, father. It's about me.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:01.759
That's a relief.

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.799
I have no desire to go to Athens.

00:18:05.519 --> 00:18:06.640
Fine, Timothy.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.720
If not Athens, then Alexandria.

00:18:09.279 --> 00:18:12.240
I just want you to have the best education possible.

00:18:12.799 --> 00:18:14.400
Either city can give you that.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.240
No, father, you don't understand that.

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:21.119
My son, I have great confidence in you, even if you don't have it in yourself.

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:24.079
I've groomed you for this all your life.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.160
Yes, father, and I appreciate what you've done for me.

00:18:29.279 --> 00:18:30.640
But my goals have changed.

00:18:31.599 --> 00:18:34.799
I want to engage more fully in preaching the good news about Christ.

00:18:34.799 --> 00:18:35.119
What?

00:18:36.799 --> 00:18:37.599
What did you say?

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.039
I want to pursue my ministry full time.

00:18:41.039 --> 00:18:43.920
Timothy, do you know what you're saying?

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:48.160
Do you want to bring ostracism upon this household and upon yourself?

00:18:49.119 --> 00:18:52.000
Everybody everywhere speaks against this sect.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.799
How could you throw your life away for it?

00:18:54.799 --> 00:18:56.319
I'm not throwing my life away.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.200
No, how else shall I view your decision?

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:03.839
Those of course followers of that man, Jesus, are despised and persecuted.

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.799
Will our family become a laughing stock?

00:19:09.119 --> 00:19:11.039
No, no, Timothy.

00:19:11.039 --> 00:19:12.480
No son of mine will do this.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.480
I only wanted to, God's will.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:16.720
Is it God's will for you to be dead?

00:19:17.519 --> 00:19:18.960
I want you alive.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:22.319
Am I going to find you outside the city one day clinging to life

00:19:22.319 --> 00:19:25.279
because our people turned on you like they turned on Paul?

00:19:26.079 --> 00:19:27.440
No, this cannot be.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.039
Father, you know that I love you deeply,

00:19:31.599 --> 00:19:33.680
but you always taught me to honor the gods.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.160
I am honoring the only true God.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.640
This is the best way I know how to do that.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.200
This is not what we had planned.

00:19:41.839 --> 00:19:43.519
This is not what I dreamed for you.

00:19:44.559 --> 00:19:47.759
Timothy, you've broken my heart.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.559
You must put my dinner away.

00:19:50.559 --> 00:19:51.759
I'm no longer hungry.

00:20:05.279 --> 00:20:06.720
I'm sorry brother Timothy.

00:20:07.599 --> 00:20:11.119
I can't help but feel so foolish for coming to you with my small problems.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:15.359
What you went through, I never knew.

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.559
So many of our brothers are going through far worse.

00:20:18.559 --> 00:20:20.079
Did your father ever speak to you again?

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.200
Certainly.

00:20:21.839 --> 00:20:23.920
In fact, he allowed me to pursue my goals.

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.039
And he always supported our household while he was alive.

00:20:29.069 --> 00:20:30.109
He was a good man.

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:34.690
So how long was it before you traveled with Paul?

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:38.130
Some years later after I lived in Iconian for a short time.

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:41.569
Traveling with brother Paul was quite a blessing.

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:45.970
But before the blessing came other tests.

00:21:00.529 --> 00:21:02.130
Mother, are you sure you're making enough food?

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:04.769
The brothers from Iconian were also coming.

00:21:04.769 --> 00:21:06.849
For when I remember, they have big appetites.

00:21:06.849 --> 00:21:08.529
Don't worry, Timothy.

00:21:08.529 --> 00:21:10.130
Leave the cooking to us.

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:13.490
You just go and make sure you have that room in order for them to meet in.

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:14.130
It's ready.

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:16.289
Jonathan!

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:18.609
Jonathan!

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:22.609
Oh my, how long has it been since we've seen you?

00:21:22.609 --> 00:21:24.529
About two or three years, Sister Lois.

00:21:24.529 --> 00:21:26.369
My friend, it's wonderful to see you.

00:21:26.369 --> 00:21:28.289
Oh, so good to see you too, Timothy.

00:21:28.289 --> 00:21:29.569
And who is this?

00:21:29.569 --> 00:21:30.769
Do you remember, Pursus?

00:21:30.769 --> 00:21:32.690
We all used to play together when we were children

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:34.289
until our family moved to Athens.

00:21:34.289 --> 00:21:35.809
Why, of course.

00:21:37.009 --> 00:21:40.849
Oh, and look how you've grown into a lovely young one.

00:21:40.849 --> 00:21:42.450
Oh, thank you, Sister Lois.

00:21:43.009 --> 00:21:45.089
Well, we came to announce that we're engaged to be married.

00:21:46.049 --> 00:21:47.730
That's wonderful.

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:48.690
Congratulations.

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:49.569
Thank you.

00:21:49.569 --> 00:21:51.170
I also came to talk to you, my friend.

00:21:52.609 --> 00:21:55.089
It's been so long since we've been able to talk face to face.

00:21:55.089 --> 00:21:56.609
I read every one of your letters, Jonathan.

00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:00.289
There's so much in those letters I couldn't tell you, Timothy.

00:22:00.289 --> 00:22:03.329
I can't even begin to describe what it was like being in Athens.

00:22:03.329 --> 00:22:05.650
The education I received just opened my mind.

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:07.890
I got my experience in Iconia, man.

00:22:08.769 --> 00:22:09.809
Are you serious?

00:22:10.369 --> 00:22:12.690
I'm talking about a higher education in Athens.

00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:15.410
You have heard of it, haven't you?

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:17.890
The games, the theater, the great teachers.

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:20.289
Remember, I was planning on going there with you.

00:22:21.009 --> 00:22:22.289
But Iconia.

00:22:22.289 --> 00:22:23.970
Now, that was an experience.

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:26.369
The congregation there gave me my real education.

00:22:26.849 --> 00:22:29.569
What a joy it was to see young ones making the truth their own.

00:22:29.569 --> 00:22:31.569
Well, if they wanted to see another follower of Jesus,

00:22:31.569 --> 00:22:33.170
they had to look no further.

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:34.690
They had Timothy in the flesh.

00:22:36.049 --> 00:22:37.730
Actually, I learned more than they did.

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:38.930
Oh, please.

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:40.369
You don't know what a real education is

00:22:40.369 --> 00:22:42.210
until you go to a place like Athens.

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:44.289
I'm ready for anything the world throws my way.

00:22:44.849 --> 00:22:46.369
Sounds like things have worked out for you.

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:54.369
So, what about you?

00:22:57.339 --> 00:22:59.500
I know it must be tough after your father died.

00:23:01.019 --> 00:23:02.859
The family business isn't what it used to be.

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:04.460
No.

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:06.220
What are your plans, Timothy?

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:07.660
Don't you want financial security?

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:10.059
We're content having sustenance and covering.

00:23:10.059 --> 00:23:11.900
Keeping my life simple has given me freedom

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:13.420
to do more for the congregation.

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:14.140
Yeah.

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:16.140
But don't you ever wonder what's out there?

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:18.059
There are times when I think about having more.

00:23:19.019 --> 00:23:20.859
But I've found that true to the master's words

00:23:20.859 --> 00:23:23.579
giving a God service brings real happiness.

00:23:24.539 --> 00:23:27.339
You always have struggle to maintain your spiritual priorities

00:23:27.339 --> 00:23:29.579
and for that I do admire you.

00:23:30.299 --> 00:23:32.940
But as for me and my household, we're moving to Ephesus.

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:33.819
Really?

00:23:33.819 --> 00:23:36.140
I met this prominent Christian from Ephesus

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:37.579
who is in Athens on business.

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:42.059
His name is Phyletus and he's got this thriving trading company

00:23:42.059 --> 00:23:43.259
and he asked me to join.

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:45.579
Timothy, I told him about you

00:23:45.579 --> 00:23:46.460
and from what he says,

00:23:47.099 --> 00:23:49.819
there's plenty of opportunity in a city for both of us.

00:23:49.819 --> 00:23:50.299
Really?

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:52.700
But I don't want to leave my ministry.

00:23:52.859 --> 00:23:54.140
I would never want you to do that.

00:23:55.099 --> 00:23:57.180
But Timothy, if you need anything,

00:23:58.059 --> 00:23:58.539
write me.

00:23:59.339 --> 00:24:01.019
Believe me, this will be worth your while.

00:24:02.059 --> 00:24:03.980
Paul and Silas will be here shortly.

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:05.099
They would love to see you.

00:24:05.099 --> 00:24:06.220
Why not stay in?

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:07.180
I'd love to.

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:09.019
Jonathan?

00:24:09.019 --> 00:24:10.140
Your parents are waiting.

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:11.819
We have to go.

00:24:13.259 --> 00:24:15.740
Jonathan, how I've enjoyed seeing you again.

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:18.940
Exactly what did you mean when you said

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:20.460
it would be worth my while?

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:21.099
Timothy,

00:24:21.819 --> 00:24:22.779
look at this number.

00:24:25.299 --> 00:24:26.579
That's your share of the business.

00:24:26.579 --> 00:24:27.380
That's a good prospect.

00:24:28.339 --> 00:24:29.859
But I would just think about it.

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:31.859
Remember what I said though,

00:24:31.859 --> 00:24:34.420
if you need anything, write me.

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:38.099
Jonathan, we really must go now.

00:24:38.099 --> 00:24:38.579
Yes, dear.

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:42.259
Timothy, we can be a great team.

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.740
Believe me, this will be worth your while, my friend.

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:48.180
Who knows, Jonathan?

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:49.940
Don't forget about us here in Lister.

00:24:49.940 --> 00:25:26.400
Silas are here.

00:25:27.359 --> 00:25:28.480
Welcome, brothers.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:28.880
Hello.

00:25:30.319 --> 00:25:31.200
It's good to see you.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.000
Please, come in.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:32.880
Timothy.

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.680
It looks like you're cooking for the whole congregation, Eunice.

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.720
Paul, Silas, you must be famished.

00:25:39.599 --> 00:25:41.759
And are these the fine elders from Iconia?

00:25:42.559 --> 00:25:45.920
Timothy always speaks so fondly of the brothers in your city.

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.359
We were so happy to have him.

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.319
Timothy, we've been talking about you.

00:25:50.319 --> 00:25:51.519
You have brother Silas?

00:25:51.519 --> 00:25:52.319
Yes, Timothy.

00:25:52.319 --> 00:25:56.000
We've been hearing good things from the elders both in Listera and in Iconia.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.799
Your faith and devotion are evident in this congregation.

00:25:58.799 --> 00:26:01.440
You've gained the brothers' respect and Iconium as well.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.519
What are your goals, Timothy?

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.480
I love the congregation here in Listera,

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.880
but there's so much to do in the large work beyond our city.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:12.880
I plan to talk to you and brother Paul about making myself available to do more.

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:14.960
I'm glad to hear that, Timothy.

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:17.359
You've matured spiritually since we left.

00:26:17.359 --> 00:26:19.200
What has it been three years now?

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.160
Let me ask you about something,

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:25.359
that the brothers and I have discussed at length and prayed about.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:26.480
What is it, brother Paul?

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:29.359
We need help as we preach the good news among the nations.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.559
We'd like you to join us in the missionary work.

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:33.519
Me?

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:36.960
I'm speechless.

00:26:37.839 --> 00:26:38.559
So you are.

00:26:39.359 --> 00:26:42.000
But will you accept the assignment?

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.920
This is what I've prayed about for years.

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.880
But with my father gone and both mother and grandmother in need,

00:26:49.519 --> 00:26:51.200
it may not be the best time.

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:54.480
Timothy, this is an answer to your prayers.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.960
We've spoken to the Lister body of elders.

00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:01.279
They've lovingly agreed to assist your family if necessary in your absence.

00:27:01.279 --> 00:27:03.599
Your father did not leave us with nothing.

00:27:03.599 --> 00:27:05.680
We'll get along with your over's help.

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:08.079
What about you, grandmother?

00:27:09.279 --> 00:27:11.920
Timothy, we'll be just fine.

00:27:12.799 --> 00:27:14.799
Let God use you to the full.

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:18.559
Will you accept the assignment, Timothy?

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.279
How could I reject such a privilege?

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000
But mother, are you sure?

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.039
When I left Freikonium, father was here.

00:27:27.039 --> 00:27:27.920
Now?

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:31.119
My son, we will miss you terribly.

00:27:31.119 --> 00:27:33.279
But nothing could make us happier.

00:27:33.279 --> 00:27:35.519
You're leaving for the best reason of all.

00:27:35.519 --> 00:27:38.240
And that's to serve God more fully.

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:54.529
Missionary life led to many blessings.

00:27:54.529 --> 00:28:03.519
But my goals were challenged in ways I had never thought of before.

00:28:03.519 --> 00:28:10.160
Give my greetings to every holy one in union with Christ Jesus.

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:14.880
I want to send greetings from our brothers here in Rome.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:15.680
Take this down.

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.519
The brothers who are with me send you their greetings.

00:28:20.559 --> 00:28:25.680
All of the holy ones, but especially those of the household of Caesar send you their greetings.

00:28:27.039 --> 00:28:30.000
And Timothy, one final word for our brothers.

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.720
The undeserved kindness of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:28:35.279 --> 00:28:37.279
be with the Spirit you show.

00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:46.829
Excellent, Paul.

00:28:46.829 --> 00:28:48.109
This letter is motivating.

00:28:48.109 --> 00:28:50.269
Is she all arranged to send it to Philippi?

00:28:50.269 --> 00:28:51.549
Yes, please do so.

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:56.259
What is it, Timothy?

00:28:56.259 --> 00:28:58.500
Have we forgotten something in our letter?

00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.539
No, it's quite complete.

00:29:00.259 --> 00:29:01.140
Then what is it?

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:04.019
Nothing important.

00:29:04.019 --> 00:29:05.700
Something is wrong, my son.

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:07.460
You haven't been yourself for days.

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:10.500
Is there something we need to talk about?

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:11.299
It'll be fine.

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:14.339
Are you hiding something from me?

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:22.210
I feel unworthy.

00:29:23.329 --> 00:29:24.049
What do you mean?

00:29:25.009 --> 00:29:26.450
You praise me too much, Paul.

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:28.930
What did you write to our brothers in Philippi?

00:29:29.809 --> 00:29:34.529
I have no one else of a disposition like his, who like a son with a father,

00:29:34.529 --> 00:29:37.410
slaved with me for the furtherance of the good news.

00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:38.609
I mean that.

00:29:38.609 --> 00:29:39.250
I know you do.

00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:41.329
But I can't live up to these words.

00:29:42.049 --> 00:29:44.369
You've always seen more in me than I see in myself.

00:29:45.089 --> 00:29:45.410
Why?

00:29:48.349 --> 00:29:49.950
Do you remember when we first met?

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:54.109
How could I forget almost 15 years ago?

00:29:55.309 --> 00:29:56.430
I thought we had lost you.

00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:59.230
Yes, Lister almost became my grave.

00:29:59.869 --> 00:30:02.589
How your family nursed me when I returned from Derby.

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:05.309
That memory will always be with me.

00:30:06.349 --> 00:30:09.230
Do you recall how we would sit for hours and talk?

00:30:10.269 --> 00:30:12.990
You opened my eyes to a world I never even knew existed.

00:30:13.869 --> 00:30:15.470
I still call it to mind your words.

00:30:16.109 --> 00:30:18.589
How are those multitudes here without someone to preach?

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:24.349
Then you spoke of Macedonia, of Athens, of Rome, even of Spain.

00:30:25.069 --> 00:30:29.390
You envisioned congregations of fellow believers springing up everywhere around the great sea.

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:33.069
And when we spoke of missionary service, I saw your eyes light up.

00:30:33.789 --> 00:30:39.470
I saw your sincere faith, a faith that dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice.

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:40.829
They said a fine example.

00:30:41.309 --> 00:30:44.670
Yes, but it was you who chose to follow their example.

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:49.309
When you helped to care for my wounds, I saw empathy in your eyes.

00:30:49.869 --> 00:30:54.109
And when we talked about working for the Lord, there was excitement in your heart.

00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:59.789
You displayed unwavering loyalty and I came to have confidence in you.

00:31:00.349 --> 00:31:02.670
I so much wanted to help you with the work.

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:03.630
That's my point.

00:31:04.109 --> 00:31:08.910
When I returned to Listerus some three years later, you had grown into a capable young man.

00:31:09.869 --> 00:31:13.710
It was then I realized that my prayers were answered.

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:14.990
You've mentioned that before.

00:31:15.789 --> 00:31:17.309
Silas and I needed help.

00:31:17.869 --> 00:31:19.069
Mark had left us.

00:31:19.069 --> 00:31:20.750
Barnabas was no longer with me.

00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:23.549
The brothers had nothing but praise for you.

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:30.430
And when we laid our hands upon you, it was revealed to us that Jehovah had further work for you.

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:38.339
How I appreciate God's hand in these matters.

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:41.700
You have truly made your advancement manifest.

00:31:42.259 --> 00:31:47.140
So when I write that I have no one else of this disposition, it is the truth.

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:49.299
But many of worked hard in spreading the good news.

00:31:49.859 --> 00:31:53.940
Yes, but you are the one who has stuck with me through all these years,

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:56.339
through all the tears and all the trials.

00:31:56.420 --> 00:32:01.700
Who could have passed up such a privilege to see the good news preached in all the world under heaven?

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:03.700
Many young men with your gifts have.

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:05.220
Think about it.

00:32:05.779 --> 00:32:08.420
Would your father have chosen this course for you?

00:32:09.619 --> 00:32:11.299
You spoke of your friend Jonathan.

00:32:12.099 --> 00:32:13.539
Would he have recommended this?

00:32:14.259 --> 00:32:15.460
Look at where you are.

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:16.819
Look at me.

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:19.380
You are with a person who's in prison.

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:22.420
This cannot be what others envision for you.

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:26.660
In fact, I doubt you would even envision this for yourself.

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:27.299
Maybe not.

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:29.700
But I wouldn't trade it for anything.

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:32.420
What could give greater satisfaction?

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:33.619
Higher learning?

00:32:33.619 --> 00:32:34.019
Wealth?

00:32:34.819 --> 00:32:35.779
They can't compare.

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:38.339
Thanks to Jehovah, I am rich.

00:32:39.059 --> 00:32:41.460
I've received the best education a man can have.

00:32:42.819 --> 00:32:48.019
Is it any wonder than Timothy that you've become like a dear child to me?

00:32:54.059 --> 00:32:56.140
Ah, here was God.

00:33:03.119 --> 00:33:09.359
By the gods, Paul, you and your troublemaking friends, your brothers,

00:33:10.559 --> 00:33:12.480
not shut your mouths, will you?

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:16.559
We found this one babbling about that miracle working Messiah to one of our men.

00:33:17.519 --> 00:33:22.400
Do you realize your subversive lunacy has destroyed some of our best families in Rome?

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:25.680
We cannot stop speaking about what we have seen and heard.

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:28.240
Paul, this is not a matter to be taken lightly.

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.359
If I ever catch you,

00:33:31.599 --> 00:33:36.720
or your friends, sharing any more of your laughable ideas with my men of the Praetorian Guard,

00:33:37.759 --> 00:33:39.440
you will receive no more visitors.

00:33:42.369 --> 00:33:45.329
Or worse, God is our helper.

00:33:45.329 --> 00:33:46.849
You're not afraid.

00:33:46.849 --> 00:33:48.289
What can men do to us?

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:58.740
Did they hurt you, my son?

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:00.339
No, I'm fine.

00:34:03.069 --> 00:34:05.069
I've learned to deal with that kind of persecution.

00:34:07.259 --> 00:34:11.659
What I've never been able to adjust to are the disagreements within the congregation.

00:34:12.619 --> 00:34:16.219
And to handle these situations without your help, Paul, I'm just not ready.

00:34:17.099 --> 00:34:20.219
Ah, your next assignment, Ephesus.

00:34:20.219 --> 00:34:24.539
We met with our Ephesian brothers in my litus, what, five years ago.

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:28.780
You warned them that oppressive wolves would mistreat the flock.

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:31.820
We cautioned them that these would arise from right among them.

00:34:32.619 --> 00:34:36.139
Now I understand this lack of confidence you're experiencing.

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:40.860
Whether it's the love of money, the desire for prominence,

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:45.340
or the desires of the flesh, some of our brothers have been led astray.

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:47.099
That's what concerns me.

00:34:47.099 --> 00:34:51.739
Timothy, you are well-qualified to shepherd our brothers and Ephesus.

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:54.780
To readjust some of our fellow Christians there,

00:34:55.500 --> 00:35:00.219
and to warn certain persons there to stop spreading false teachings.

00:35:00.219 --> 00:35:01.900
I'm worried about my friend Jonathan.

00:35:02.619 --> 00:35:05.500
He and his family moved to Ephesus more than 10 years ago.

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:07.820
Do you think he's going astray?

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:09.900
He appears to be prospering materially.

00:35:10.619 --> 00:35:14.059
But sometimes I wonder how the move is affected his family spiritually.

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:17.900
In his letters, he seems more determined than ever to become rich.

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:21.659
It seems that he's holding on to the truth only by a thread.

00:35:21.659 --> 00:35:27.420
That's why I'm sending you to help our brothers get a firm hold on the real life.

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:29.659
This may be my most difficult assignment yet.

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:33.820
Some of the brothers there have been in the truth nearly as long as I've been alive.

00:35:34.539 --> 00:35:36.619
But no one looked down on your youth.

00:35:37.579 --> 00:35:41.099
See to it that they look up to you as an example and speech,

00:35:41.099 --> 00:35:43.179
behavior, faith and love.

00:35:43.739 --> 00:35:44.699
How can I do that?

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:49.820
Don't allow the subtle influences of this world to sidetrack you.

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:53.579
Especially could that be a problem in a place like Ephesus?

00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:59.579
Give your whole attention to spiritual pursuits so that your progress is plain for all to see.

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:04.059
I pray that Jehovah give me the spirit and power I need to do that.

00:36:05.019 --> 00:36:08.460
My son, God will finish your training.

00:36:10.219 --> 00:36:11.659
I will sorely miss you, Paul.

00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:15.420
I feel as if I'm leaving my family all over again.

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:17.659
And I will miss you.

00:36:18.699 --> 00:36:22.539
But wherever you are, you will be in my thoughts and prayers.

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:25.980
It's time to think about departing.

00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:29.179
Will I ever see you again?

00:36:30.619 --> 00:36:31.420
I hope so.

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:34.539
Timothy.

00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:37.980
Yes, you are ready, my son.

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:08.340
My friend Timothy.

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:15.150
Oh, it has been such a long time.

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:17.630
We are so delighted to have you back in Ephesus.

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:21.070
When I heard you were coming, I wasn't about to miss this meeting.

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:22.269
I'm glad Jonathan.

00:37:22.269 --> 00:37:23.150
How's Pursus?

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:24.670
Good, she's home nursing our newborn.

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:25.710
Is that your third?

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:26.030
Fourth.

00:37:26.829 --> 00:37:29.389
Three daughters and a son who's about to turn 11.

00:37:29.389 --> 00:37:32.510
Timothy, good to see you are doing well.

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:34.190
Oh, if I leave, excuse me.

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:36.510
Timothy and I have a lot to catch up on.

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:38.909
Timothy, you do remember Phyletus, don't you?

00:37:38.909 --> 00:37:40.190
Yes, of course.

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:42.030
Jonathan often speaks of you in his letters.

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:44.110
And nearly everyone is spoken of you, Timothy.

00:37:44.110 --> 00:37:46.269
Phyletus is generous and well respected

00:37:46.269 --> 00:37:48.110
in the congregation and in the city.

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:51.150
Some teach others preach and I give what I can.

00:37:51.869 --> 00:37:54.190
He's helped so many brothers make a good living.

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:58.590
Thanks to Phyletus, I am finally achieving some of the goals I set when I left Lestra.

00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:00.349
I'm happy for you, Jonathan.

00:38:00.349 --> 00:38:01.630
And how you doing in the congregation?

00:38:03.389 --> 00:38:06.989
Well, I mean, I'm here, am I not?

00:38:06.989 --> 00:38:08.750
You know that's not what I'm asking you about.

00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:10.190
Jonathan is a fine brother.

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:12.670
He does what he can as a young man with a family.

00:38:13.789 --> 00:38:16.829
Now you, Timothy, you're a man in your prime.

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:18.750
With great potential.

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:22.670
What are your plans here in Ephesus?

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:25.070
I came to minister to the friends here in Ephesus.

00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:26.909
Paul has assigned me to help the congregation.

00:38:26.909 --> 00:38:28.670
Ah, our brother Paul.

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:30.829
Is he still in prison?

00:38:31.789 --> 00:38:34.110
Brother Phyletus, you and all the brothers

00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:36.190
are aware that Paul is no longer in prison.

00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:37.389
So why would you ask that?

00:38:37.389 --> 00:38:39.550
Well, you just never know with our brother Paul

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:41.070
from one day to the next.

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:45.309
Anyway, it was so tragic to hear you suffered along with him, Timothy.

00:38:46.429 --> 00:38:49.150
Paul is getting along in years, but you.

00:38:50.349 --> 00:38:52.670
You've got your best years ahead of you.

00:38:54.699 --> 00:38:57.820
Is it true that Paul wants you to live a life of self-denial?

00:38:58.380 --> 00:38:59.659
A life of self-denial?

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:03.260
No, a life of self-sacrifice.

00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:05.739
Yes, and I've been blessed to choose such a life.

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:09.260
Many times Paul and I have had an abundance physically,

00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:10.619
but other times we've been in one.

00:39:11.179 --> 00:39:14.139
Yet our cup has always overflowed spiritually.

00:39:14.139 --> 00:39:18.460
I'm happy to hear that, but Timothy, you can have it all in Ephesus.

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:22.860
A good life, both physically and spiritually, just as Jonathan does.

00:39:24.219 --> 00:39:27.739
You both seem very confident in your ability to pursue riches

00:39:27.739 --> 00:39:29.579
while pursuing kingdom interests.

00:39:29.579 --> 00:39:32.139
Yet our Lord said that this would be more difficult than a camel

00:39:32.139 --> 00:39:33.340
entering the eye of a needle.

00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:35.739
But it's not wrong to want a better life, isn't it?

00:39:35.739 --> 00:39:38.219
Only when the pursuit of such a life becomes a priority.

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:40.380
That's when a man becomes divided.

00:39:41.099 --> 00:39:43.900
You cannot slave for God and for riches, fileness.

00:39:44.539 --> 00:39:46.699
I've been greatly blessed in pursuing kingdom interests.

00:39:46.699 --> 00:39:51.260
No doubt, but what kind of stability could this traveling life bring you?

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:56.059
By the way, Timothy, how is your mother back in Listera?

00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:58.139
Could you use a bit more help?

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:01.019
It can't be easy being a widow.

00:40:01.019 --> 00:40:02.860
She is such a dear sister.

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:05.260
Are you really concerned about my mother, filetus?

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:06.780
Well, you're just trying to further your point.

00:40:07.659 --> 00:40:09.980
My mother's serving faithfully back in Listera.

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:12.300
The brothers there have lovingly helped me care for her needs

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:13.500
when I can't be there personally.

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:18.940
Charity, this is merely an example of how you could do so much more with your connections,

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:22.219
with your abilities and your experience.

00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:25.099
Surely you want to reach your fullest potential.

00:40:25.099 --> 00:40:27.019
Timothy, filetus is right.

00:40:27.019 --> 00:40:29.099
There is no telling what you could achieve here.

00:40:29.659 --> 00:40:31.179
Let me be straight with you, Timothy.

00:40:32.059 --> 00:40:38.380
When I see young ones like you, I worry that certain brothers are not looking out for your

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:38.940
best interest.

00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:40.780
And you, filetus, are you really?

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:41.659
Please, let me finish.

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:45.260
I've heard the words of our brother Paul and his letter

00:40:45.739 --> 00:40:49.179
with all his ramblings against the, uh, how did he put it?

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:51.579
Uncertain riches?

00:40:52.619 --> 00:40:54.699
Senseless and hurtful desires and alike?

00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:58.139
Don't you think he's become a bit unbalanced?

00:40:58.139 --> 00:40:58.940
Oh, definitely.

00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:01.820
I pray that all of our brothers require such a zeal for the kingdom.

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:04.460
I'm only telling you what many people feel in their heart,

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:05.739
but are afraid to say.

00:41:05.739 --> 00:41:07.260
Be careful, filetus.

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:08.380
The heart is treacherous.

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:10.860
Yes, but that cuts both ways.

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:14.780
Paul has spent more time in prison of late than administering to the congregations.

00:41:15.739 --> 00:41:18.860
Of course, he says that the great minds of this world are in darkness.

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:23.260
If he admitted that this nation was the greatest and most enlightened in history,

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:27.739
which it is, he'd be admitting that his own choices in life have been on why.

00:41:27.739 --> 00:41:30.059
I think that you are the one that has been misled by this.

00:41:30.059 --> 00:41:33.739
You say that, but Paul is the one who writes these letters from our prison cell.

00:41:35.179 --> 00:41:37.900
A bitter old man, alone with his thoughts,

00:41:38.699 --> 00:41:41.900
stubbornly clinging to the ill-advised course he chose decades ago.

00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:43.900
It's clear to see.

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.139
Paul is out of touch with reality.

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:50.059
Our brother Paul is very much in touch with kingdom realities.

00:41:50.699 --> 00:41:53.420
This is something that fleshly men without faith cannot fathom.

00:41:54.059 --> 00:41:56.300
Christ appointed Paul as an apostle to the nations.

00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:58.619
Jehovah is richly blessing his ministry.

00:41:58.619 --> 00:41:59.579
How dare you say that?

00:41:59.579 --> 00:42:00.619
Look, credit be.

00:42:00.619 --> 00:42:03.179
That Paul promotes his personal ideas.

00:42:04.139 --> 00:42:06.059
Let's talk about the love of might.

00:42:08.139 --> 00:42:09.739
From a man that has nothing.

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:13.099
Honestly, Timothy, how seriously can we take that?

00:42:13.099 --> 00:42:15.420
I've been forgotten that Jesus had nowhere to lay his head.

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:18.059
Paul admonishes husbands and wives.

00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:24.780
Yet, what does a man with no wife or children know about family responsibilities,

00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:26.539
no Timothy?

00:42:26.539 --> 00:42:28.699
He teaches his own worth beliefs.

00:42:28.699 --> 00:42:29.980
Not the commands of God.

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:32.300
If I lead us, stop thinking like a fleshly man.

00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:35.900
I'd monitor you to stick to the helpful teaching handed on by the apostles.

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:39.900
To reduce the Christian way of life to a life of comfort and convenience,

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:42.219
would be to miss the purpose of God's undeserved community.

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:45.980
Is that a way he speaks to an older person who offers his hand to you?

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:48.940
If I lead us, it's okay, John.

00:42:49.579 --> 00:42:50.059
It's okay.

00:42:52.699 --> 00:42:53.900
I understand, Timothy.

00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:56.699
This must be very upsetting to you.

00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:00.380
After all, Paul has been like a father to you.

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:03.579
Rather than holding faith in a good conscience,

00:43:03.579 --> 00:43:05.579
you speak like Hymanaeus and Alexander.

00:43:06.139 --> 00:43:08.539
You well know that such men were handed over to Satan.

00:43:08.539 --> 00:43:10.139
Hymanaeus and Alexander?

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:11.739
Is that a threat?

00:43:12.539 --> 00:43:15.260
Is someone conspiring to expel meat from the congregation?

00:43:16.139 --> 00:43:18.139
You're too young for that, Timothy.

00:43:18.139 --> 00:43:20.300
I have been a Christian since you were a mere boy.

00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:25.659
Jonathan, that is not waste anymore of Timothy's precious time.

00:43:27.179 --> 00:43:29.420
Timothy, why are you here?

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:30.699
What do you mean by?

00:43:30.699 --> 00:43:31.980
I mean what I ask.

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:32.940
Why are you here?

00:43:33.579 --> 00:43:36.219
Do you really think anyone here takes you seriously?

00:43:36.699 --> 00:43:40.460
Everyone knows that when young Timothy speaks, Paul is really talking.

00:43:41.019 --> 00:43:44.539
Oh, you are as a puppet and a poor imitation of that.

00:43:48.059 --> 00:43:51.900
Come back to us when you've grown up and have an original thought to share.

00:43:57.070 --> 00:43:59.070
Timothy, what have you done?

00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:02.110
If I let us eat, he was just trying to help you.

00:44:02.110 --> 00:44:03.949
Was he trying to help me or himself?

00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:05.869
Didn't you hear him?

00:44:05.869 --> 00:44:08.110
He wants bright young men to advance his business.

00:44:08.989 --> 00:44:12.829
People who are determined to be rich fall into all sorts of temptations and traps.

00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:16.510
Some people love money so much that they've given up their faith

00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:18.110
and cause themselves a lot of pain.

00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:21.949
First of all, he's not determined to be rich.

00:44:21.949 --> 00:44:23.070
He already is rich.

00:44:23.789 --> 00:44:26.269
And second of all, he's not in any sort of pain.

00:44:26.829 --> 00:44:28.110
Did you even look at him?

00:44:28.110 --> 00:44:30.349
Jonathan, my brother, you're missing the point.

00:44:30.349 --> 00:44:32.030
You're missing a great opportunity.

00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:35.150
I've worked with that brother for as long as you've been with Paul.

00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:38.110
He's helped out my family tremendously.

00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:39.469
Has he really, Jonathan?

00:44:40.349 --> 00:44:42.909
Isn't it time to think about your family's spiritual needs?

00:44:43.789 --> 00:44:45.550
We must put our hope on the living God.

00:44:46.269 --> 00:44:48.590
None that rests his faith in him will be disappointed.

00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:50.429
Yeah, that may work for you,

00:44:50.429 --> 00:44:52.590
but the sweat of my brow puts food on my table.

00:44:54.829 --> 00:44:56.909
I want to give my family a real future Timothy.

00:44:58.110 --> 00:45:00.349
Jonathan, you are talented.

00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:02.030
Very talented.

00:45:03.070 --> 00:45:06.190
Be careful how you use, or perhaps I should say,

00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:08.190
how you allow others to use your talents.

00:45:08.829 --> 00:45:10.590
Seek the kingdom first.

00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:13.309
That's how one lays a fine foundation for the future

00:45:13.309 --> 00:45:15.230
and gets a firmhold on the real life.

00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:18.110
Have you ever truly done that?

00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:20.349
Be honest with yourself.

00:45:20.349 --> 00:45:27.900
Timothy, I'm simply trying to provide for my family.

00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:33.699
I guess I don't know how to do both.

00:45:33.699 --> 00:45:38.300
I'm just a little confused.

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:39.099
Think, Jonathan.

00:45:39.099 --> 00:45:43.260
Isn't it time to have a simple eye focused on spiritual pursuits?

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:54.340
I wish I had your faith, Timothy.

00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:59.469
Jonathan, are you coming?

00:45:59.469 --> 00:46:01.630
I fear for you, Jonathan.

00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:05.789
Jonathan, I thought we were leaving

00:46:05.949 --> 00:46:06.429
together.

00:46:49.599 --> 00:46:51.360
I've never heard this story before.

00:46:52.159 --> 00:46:53.599
You were quite young.

00:46:53.599 --> 00:46:55.119
It's been some six years now.

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:57.119
What happened to Felitas?

00:46:58.719 --> 00:47:00.719
Sadly, he rebelled.

00:47:00.719 --> 00:47:02.559
It was finally put out of the congregation.

00:47:03.119 --> 00:47:04.079
That is sad.

00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:10.699
I realize now it wasn't as easy for you as I thought.

00:47:10.699 --> 00:47:12.780
No, I didn't always feel up to the task,

00:47:13.659 --> 00:47:16.460
but God always made up for my deficiency.

00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:17.659
Would you hope I'd do that for me?

00:47:17.739 --> 00:47:21.019
You can be certain that he will, my son.

00:47:22.219 --> 00:47:23.579
We've been looking all over for you.

00:47:24.699 --> 00:47:25.579
I'm sorry.

00:47:25.579 --> 00:47:26.699
No, I'm sorry.

00:47:26.699 --> 00:47:29.739
Jonathan, I should have asked you if I could spend some time with your son.

00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:31.900
You should have asked me,

00:47:32.619 --> 00:47:34.460
what better friend could my son be with?

00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:37.179
Brother Timothy was telling me about when he was my age.

00:47:37.179 --> 00:47:37.500
Oh.

00:47:39.699 --> 00:47:41.460
That means he was telling you about your father

00:47:42.099 --> 00:47:44.019
before he got serious about the truth.

00:47:44.019 --> 00:47:45.539
Now this is quite a story.

00:47:46.179 --> 00:47:49.059
Dear Parsis, I was just telling Julius that all of us

00:47:49.059 --> 00:47:51.460
have had his struggle to maintain our spiritual goals.

00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:53.860
He told me about that argument he had with Felitas.

00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:55.940
That was something.

00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:56.579
It sure was.

00:47:57.539 --> 00:47:59.619
You could say that was a turning point in my life.

00:47:59.619 --> 00:48:02.099
If I'd lead us could not hide his true character anymore.

00:48:02.099 --> 00:48:05.219
Until that moment, I had completely blinded myself

00:48:05.219 --> 00:48:06.820
to his selfish and wicked reasonings.

00:48:07.539 --> 00:48:08.579
It really frightened me.

00:48:09.219 --> 00:48:11.219
I was afraid just hearing the story

00:48:11.219 --> 00:48:13.539
is if Jehovah was going to strike him right there.

00:48:14.179 --> 00:48:15.300
When I got home that day,

00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:19.059
I took a good look at my family and I dropped to my knees.

00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:22.900
And I begged God to show me what was truly worthwhile to pursue.

00:48:24.099 --> 00:48:28.739
And it became clear that our thoughts, our goals and our priorities were just not right.

00:48:28.739 --> 00:48:31.059
We said we were doing it all for the children,

00:48:31.059 --> 00:48:33.539
but they were the ones who were suffering spiritually.

00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:38.340
Deep inside, we knew Jehovah's service had been all but abandoned.

00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:40.579
God gave me a glimpse of how I looked that day.

00:48:41.219 --> 00:48:42.340
And it was not pleasant.

00:48:43.059 --> 00:48:44.900
It was like a lamp had been lit.

00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:51.219
And Timothy, I think Jehovah for your fine example.

00:48:51.219 --> 00:48:54.579
And we thank him for the good effect you've had on the congregation

00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:56.420
and on our family.

00:48:57.059 --> 00:48:59.460
Serving Jehovah has brought so much happiness to me.

00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:02.980
There were opportunities to get involved in other pursuits,

00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:08.179
but believe me, God made it worth my while to serve Him our fully.

00:49:08.179 --> 00:49:10.579
And I don't regret one day of my service to Him.

00:49:10.659 --> 00:49:12.659
That's what I want to be able to say when I'm older.

00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:18.340
And Julius, Timothy imitated the apostle Paul even as he did the Christ.

00:49:19.219 --> 00:49:20.820
So who can you imitate when you grow up?

00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:23.219
I can imitate brother Timothy.

00:49:24.099 --> 00:49:25.940
Better to imitate Jesus, my young friend.

00:49:26.739 --> 00:49:30.019
And Jesus enjoyed good food with good friends.

00:49:30.739 --> 00:49:31.539
Come on, let's go.

00:49:32.179 --> 00:49:33.780
Pursus is cooking your favorite tonight.

00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:38.820
There isn't a more satisfying life than serving Jehovah fully.
