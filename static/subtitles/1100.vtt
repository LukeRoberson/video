00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:19.170
I thought happiness was all about money and getting to buy whatever I wanted.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.250
I was really into fashion.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.530
I was always thinking about what I was going to get next and I didn't mind putting an extra

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:33.140
overtime to get it.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.500
My day ended with me taking the last train home, eating, and then bed at one or two o'clock

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.140
in the morning.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.460
This affected me mentally and physically.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.899
I'd wake up in the middle of the night with panic attacks.

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:53.219
I felt so lost and confused.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.579
Everything I'd worked for was for nothing.

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:11.359
My motor for shopping was when in doubt, by, I bought a lot of things, powerful motorcycles,

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:15.200
the house, cars.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:22.579
I was totally absorbed in work and sometimes worked all night.

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:28.739
I somehow made it to meetings, but after they ended, I'd leave right away.

00:01:28.739 --> 00:01:32.579
I didn't show interest in anyone, not even my wife.

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.900
All I ever talked about was work and I showed a real lack of consideration for my wife.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.379
I was really blunt with her and there was a constant back and forth between us.

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.060
And we had a strained relationship.

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.019
We weren't happy.

00:01:50.019 --> 00:01:52.980
We just felt stress, stress, and more stress.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.459
Everything seemed pointless.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:14.050
I realized that I hadn't been caring for myself on the inside, so I decided to read the

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.650
Bible all over again.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.090
I was especially moved by how Jehovah repeatedly tried to help the Israelites,

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.770
despite all their failures.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.409
This reminded me that Jehovah had been expressing his love for me all along.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.900
I couldn't hold back my tears.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.699
I decided that I'd live the rest of my life for him.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.580
I adjusted my work and made the ministry the focal point in my life.

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:56.819
When I get to share a Bible scripture with someone and see it make an impact on them,

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.659
I feel truly happy.

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:12.960
I saw some brothers from the congregation playing soccer with a young boy who had just lost his father.

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:17.520
They were trying to comfort him by spending time with him.

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.199
When I saw them showing personal interest in someone and considering others' feelings,

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:27.280
it really impressed me.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.479
And I thought, I want to use my time like that as well.

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:37.280
A scripture in the Bible says, there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.560
The more I practiced it, the happier I became.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.680
I became convinced that this really is the truth.

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.840
Now, when my wife and I spend time together,

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.439
I am better able to really understand her and have come to realize how much she means to me.

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:57.919
I am so thankful that Jehovah has taught me the truth.
