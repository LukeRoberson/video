00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:16.660
My name is Gabriela.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.660
Ben and I have always enjoyed attending the meetings.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.660
But lately, it's been difficult.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.660
Something was missing.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.579
Our son.

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:47.179
It was like watching a movie of someone else's family.

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:58.310
Couldn't believe this was happening to us.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:36.879
Our son, Levi, was no longer one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:42.879
The elders and friends in the congregation were so supportive and understanding.

00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:46.879
Many of them watched Levi grow up.

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:48.879
Give his first talk.

00:01:48.879 --> 00:01:50.879
Get baptized.

00:01:50.879 --> 00:02:14.669
I was so torn.

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:18.669
I was disappointed in Levi for leaving Jehovah.

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:21.669
But I was more disappointed in myself.

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:26.020
I felt like we've failed him somehow.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:34.259
I kept wondering how he was doing.

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:36.259
Was he okay?

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:53.139
Then, as hard as the past few weeks had been, it just got harder.

00:02:53.139 --> 00:03:01.139
I knew what the Bible said about quit mixing in company with anyone who is not living according to Christian standards.

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:05.139
But I never thought that scripture would one day apply to me.

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:13.129
Later that evening, a brother was talking about the example of Korra's sons.

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:28.460
Jehovah confirmed that he was using Moses to lead his people.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.460
Not Korra.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:37.460
When the people were told to move away from the rebel's tents, what would Korra's sons do?

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.460
Would they put loyalty to family ahead of loyalty to Jehovah?

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:56.379
The Bible tells us that his sons remained loyal to Jehovah and were blessed for it.

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:02.379
That night, after the meeting, I told Ben about the text I received from Levi.

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.379
I told him everything.

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:11.379
How I miss Levi so much, but that I also wanted to be loyal to Jehovah.

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:19.379
Like Korra's sons, Ben admitted that he too had been struggling with feelings like mine.

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:24.379
But then, he said something that I hadn't thought of.

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:29.379
If we were to stand between Levi and the discipline he needs,

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:35.379
we would in effect be blocking an expression of Jehovah's love from reaching him.

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:42.379
In fact, it's our very loyalty to Jehovah that could save his life.

00:04:42.379 --> 00:05:08.500
We agreed to continue to put our trust in Jehovah and stay loyal to him.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:15.500
It's been five years now, and while Levi still hasn't returned to Jehovah,

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.500
I haven't given up hope on him.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.500
For that day, I'm staying busy as a regular pioneer and focusing my energies

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.500
on helping others learn about Jehovah.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:34.500
I've come to experience firsthand the truth of Psalm 9710.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.500
Jehovah really does guard his loyal ones.
