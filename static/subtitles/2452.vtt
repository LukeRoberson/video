00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:14.429
It may seem like no one knows you,

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.030
Surrounded yet you feel alone.

00:00:19.629 --> 00:00:24.429
Here is good news, there are friends all around you.

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:29.070
You just need to get to know,

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.869
To make a friend, be a friend,

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:39.469
Be kind and learn to share.

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.869
From the start, do your part

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:49.070
And show them that you can.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.869
With some time, you will find

00:00:53.869 --> 00:01:00.270
To make a friend, be a friend.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.870
I can see, friends of Jehovah,

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.670
Are friends that show love at all times.

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:23.870
If you are shy, you can pray to Jehovah.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.750
He'll help you out as you try.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:43.579
To make and learn to share the story.

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:59.310
And show them that you need to make a friend.
