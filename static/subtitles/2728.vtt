The more you study, the more you understand Jehovah, the more you understand Jehovah, the more you love them.

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.519
Jehovah clearly tells us that my thoughts are not your thoughts.

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:24.519
So if you want to understand Jehovah's thinking better, we need to dig deep in our study and then share those thoughts with others.

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:29.519
Personal study is like fuel that keeps you going.

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:38.520
Personally, I'm not a good student, but I really learned how to study the Bible. The Bible came alive during Gilead.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.520
Self-discipline is involved very much.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:53.520
I overcome the tiredness aspect of Bible study by not doing it at a time of day when I know I'm going to be tired.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.520
I can be tired for other things later on, but not for that.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:09.519
Each session of my Bible study begins with a prayer. Please help me recognize it is counsel for me and then give me the strength to work on it.

00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:14.519
I have a color code system, so I know what certain things stand for.

00:01:14.519 --> 00:01:26.519
I have a particular color for Jehovah's good hand in people's lives that have another color for warning examples.

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:32.519
I have another four. Find examples to imitate.

00:01:32.519 --> 00:01:42.519
Study and Mettation ricks together. Study helps us to acquire information and Mettation empowers us to put that information into practice.

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:49.519
You have to get behind the information, not just focus on one verse or a one chapter.

00:01:49.519 --> 00:01:57.519
Study who's involved, the time, the conditions, how many people are there, and then you'll get the true meaning of the verse.
