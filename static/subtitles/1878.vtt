00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:09.650
Since our last update, the coronavirus pandemic has taken a grimmed hole around the world.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.890
And we know that more and more of you dear brothers and sisters are grappling with the

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.370
effects of this crisis every day.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:24.769
We want to assure you of our love and of how deeply concerned we are about each one of you

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:29.250
and of the many prayers being offered in your behalf.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.850
And we trust that Jehovah will give you the power beyond what is normal, as promised

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:43.170
at 2 Corinthians 4-7, so that you can endure this pandemic with your faith in Jehovah's

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.609
unfailing promises intact.

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:53.609
Despite all the challenges we've been facing, hasn't it been encouraging to see how quickly

00:00:53.609 --> 00:01:00.009
and effectively Jehovah's people have adapted to the change in circumstances, from holding

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:07.250
meetings by video conference, to preaching and teaching by email, letter writing, telephone

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.049
and text message.

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.129
And this was especially true regarding the memorial.

00:01:15.129 --> 00:01:20.290
In this report, we'd like to share a few updates about how our brothers and sisters

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:26.209
around the world were strengthened as they came together for the special talk and the

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:28.730
memorial.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:35.170
As the day of the memorial drew closer, did you wonder how this was all going to work?

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.769
Would we be meeting in smaller groups?

00:01:37.769 --> 00:01:40.409
How would we handle the emblems?

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.609
How could we invite co-workers, neighbors and interested ones?

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:49.609
Where would we invite them to if we couldn't meet at the Kingdom Hall?

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:56.010
We long to be together on this important occasion, but we also recognized how important it was

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:03.290
to comply fully with any government restrictions and physical distancing guidelines, not only

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.969
to show our subjection to the superior authorities, but also for our own safety and that of our

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:11.849
neighbors.

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:18.330
And so we observed the memorial, even though that meant doing so in unique ways.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.849
We might never have experienced before.

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:30.810
For the first time in theocratic history, millions observed the memorial by video conference.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.409
This resulted in some unique opportunities to share the memorial with others.

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:44.009
As you may have seen on the JW.org newsroom, in the Philippines, one young pioneers invitation

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:52.250
to view the memorial by video conference resulted in over 31,000 non-witnesses tying in by video

00:02:52.250 --> 00:03:01.370
or audio for each of us, being in our own homes for the memorial was an unforgettable experience.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.409
Yet we were fully united with our brothers worldwide and demonstrating our love for Jehovah

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:12.810
and Jesus on this special day.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.810
In this video report, from Tab Homesberger, who serves as a member of the Haiti Branch Committee,

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:26.810
notice the benefits that came from observing the memorial by video conference and even by telephone

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.969
in Haiti. No doubt you identified with the feelings experienced by the brothers in Haiti.

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:42.620
We can truly say that the commemoration of Christ death in Haiti this year was a memorable memorial.

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:48.060
One congregation of 24 publishers in the far northwest of our country,

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:54.139
they were so pleased and thrilled to have 85 in attendance for the memorial in their congregation.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:01.340
A brother relates how he studied the Bible with a man in the past, but because he didn't progress,

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.259
he was decided at that time to stop the study. That was two years ago.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.460
So this year, for this year's memorial, the day, in fact, the day before the memorial,

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.099
the man, the former student calls the brother and says, I would like to attend the memorial.

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:20.779
Of course, I pray that said that would be wonderful. You can attend the memorial with our congregation

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:27.259
via Zoom. So that's what the man did. After the memorial observance, he was quite touched by it.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.939
He said, you know, when I look around the world right now, and I see everything that's happening,

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:39.019
it's very clear to me that it will be very soon when God's kingdom will intervene and put a

00:04:39.019 --> 00:04:46.379
stop to all the problems that we now know. In fact, he said, if anybody wants to serve God,

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:52.939
it is now the time to start doing so. So the man took his own counsel to heart,

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:58.540
and we're happy to say that he's attending meetings with us once again. So whether it was through

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:05.100
a bit of conferencing or telephone conference calls, we can say the faith of our brothers was

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:11.980
truly strengthened through the memorial this year. In fact, one sister, a pioneer sister

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.620
in the south of the country, she explained why it was special for her. She said, it's like we took

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:22.060
the commemoration of Christ's death, and we brought it into the homes of all the brothers and

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:30.310
sisters. And of course, Jehovah blessed that arrangement. Don't we feel united with our brothers

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:37.589
and Haiti having observed the memorial in similar ways? Here, at World Headquarters,

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:43.990
we realized that not all those invited to the memorial could log onto a video conference.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:52.069
So adjustments were made to the JW.org website to make the special talk and the memorial talk

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:59.910
available to the public to stream or download in over 500 languages. Thanks to this provision,

00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:05.029
millions more had the opportunity to benefit from these programs.

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:13.350
I'd like to share one beautiful example of a brother named Martin, who lives in a very remote town

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:19.990
in Kenya. He downloaded the memorial talk so that he could share it with others in his service group.

00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:27.350
Now, Martin is disabled and also suffers from a serious health condition that causes his body

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:35.670
to overheat. But that didn't stop him from hiring a driver with a motorcycle and traveling in hot

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:41.750
weather to provide a recording of the memorial talk to those who otherwise wouldn't have had access

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:50.709
to it. Because of Martin's self-sacrificing effort, 13 people in this remote area, including some

00:06:50.709 --> 00:06:58.230
Bible students, attended the memorial. What a blessing all of these special arrangements prove to be.

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:04.790
In many cases, they resulted in non-witness family members attending their first memorial

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:13.350
right from their own homes. Now, of course, the technology that made this possible

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:19.269
is not readily available everywhere. In many parts of Africa, for example,

00:07:19.269 --> 00:07:26.149
internet access is extremely limited. This made video and telephone conferencing

00:07:26.149 --> 00:07:34.470
or streaming talks over the internet virtually impossible. Since this all unfolded very quickly,

00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:42.069
about one week before the memorial, several African countries faced the fact that many of their

00:07:42.069 --> 00:07:50.389
publishers would not be able to use any of these options. As a result, the governing body approved

00:07:50.389 --> 00:07:57.990
for branches in Africa to make the special talk and memorial available on TV and radio.

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:07.350
As reported on JW.org, these arrangements benefited over 400,000 publishers, in addition to

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:15.189
an untold number of interested persons. Brothers worked tirelessly just days before these events

00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:22.790
to negotiate the needed arrangements with radio and TV stations. In one location in Mozambique,

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:30.069
the agreement with the TV station was finalized only three hours before the memorial talk was to

00:08:30.069 --> 00:08:37.269
be broadcast. In some congregations, after struggling with unsuccessful downloads,

00:08:37.269 --> 00:08:45.029
unreliable phone lines, and failing internet connections, the situation started to feel hopeless.

00:08:46.149 --> 00:08:51.909
Then, brothers unexpectedly started receiving emails and text messages,

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:58.549
notifying them that the memorial talk would be available on TV. In some cases,

00:08:58.549 --> 00:09:06.309
they found out just minutes before the program began. Here's how some who received the program

00:09:06.309 --> 00:09:14.870
this way expressed their gratitude. One brother said, the creator has surpassed our needs in a way

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:23.269
that we could not imagine. The pandemic cannot stop Jehovah's will. This makes us more and more

00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:31.990
convinced that he indeed is a strong tower. Another wrote, we are very grateful for the arrangement

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:37.830
that was made to broadcast the memorial. It felt like we were at the Kingdom Hall and not alone.

00:09:38.629 --> 00:09:45.750
We are deeply grateful that in this time of COVID-19, nothing has prevented us from holding the

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:54.470
memorial of the death of Jesus Christ. The branch committee in Congo, Kinshasa made similar

00:09:54.470 --> 00:10:00.629
arrangements for both the memorial and the special talk to be broadcast on television and radio

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:07.190
stations throughout the country. And the following interview with Yug Khabit Shua,

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:16.090
note the encouraging experiences that resulted. With the lack of internet in most parts of our

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:22.009
branch territory and the growing restrictions due to the pandemic, we were delighted to receive

00:10:22.009 --> 00:10:28.889
approval to have the special talk broadcast over radio. But we were asking, will it really work?

00:10:29.769 --> 00:10:35.210
A circuit of a sea reported that in the city of Gamena, brothers tried to arrange with a local

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:41.370
radio station to broadcast the special talk. But when they went to pay, they learned from the director

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:47.529
that the original time they had arranged for was no longer available. The only available time

00:10:47.529 --> 00:10:55.769
was an hour and a half earlier at 8.30am. Relying on Jehovah, they agreed to the new time, but

00:10:55.769 --> 00:11:02.169
they had only a few hours to inform everyone about the change. Despite the earlier time,

00:11:02.169 --> 00:11:09.210
many people tuned in and right after the talk, a heavy rain began disrupting all radio broadcast

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:16.250
until later that night. Jehovah's Hand was with the brothers. And we've received encouraging

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:22.570
reports from all over the territory. For example, another circuit of a sea reported that in his

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:28.649
circuit, public response to the talk was so positive that people called the radio station,

00:11:28.649 --> 00:11:34.490
asking to hear the talk again. So the brothers arranged to broadcast the talk a second time

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:41.210
on the same day. So far, this has resulted in 25 new telephone Bible studies in that circuit.

00:11:41.929 --> 00:11:48.570
Clearly, despite this pandemic, the radio worked. Jehovah made sure that this talk remains

00:11:48.649 --> 00:11:55.190
for us even more special. What do these experiences show us?

00:11:56.470 --> 00:12:02.070
Even a global pandemic could not stop us from being united in true worship.

00:12:03.269 --> 00:12:11.429
As Jesus said at John 1415, if you love me, you will observe my commandments.

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:19.750
Above all else, it was our deep love for Jehovah and for Jesus that moved us to give thanks

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:26.549
for what they did in providing the ransom and to obey Jesus' command to keep doing this in

00:12:26.549 --> 00:12:34.149
remembrance of me. We showed that love by observing the memorial and enjoying the special

00:12:34.149 --> 00:12:39.590
talk as one united people, even though it meant doing so in unique ways.

00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:49.110
We are certain that Jehovah and his son are very happy and very proud of what we were able to do

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:55.990
worldwide under the present circumstances. Surely the words of Hebrews 610 apply,

00:12:56.870 --> 00:13:03.269
where we're reminded that Jehovah will never forget our work and the love we've shown for

00:13:03.269 --> 00:13:10.629
his name. Although we don't know when the present world situation with this pandemic will end,

00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:19.669
we do know this. God's purpose will not fail. There was a beginning to the pandemic and there will

00:13:19.669 --> 00:13:27.429
be an end. Jehovah and his son will make certain that all causes for harm will soon be completely

00:13:27.429 --> 00:13:34.629
removed once this system of things is gone forever and aren't we grateful for that?

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:43.990
Please be assured of our warm love and prayers in your behalf. From the world headquarters of

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:54.549
Jehovah's Witnesses, this is J.W. Broadcasting.
