00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:11.869
I didn't have a problem with polygamy because I too was in a polygamous marriage and I

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:14.109
viewed myself as a good wife.

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:16.149
I was the second wife.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:19.989
I used to work at the mines in Kaltenville, South Africa.

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:22.829
My family lived in Botswana in Khaburoni.

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:25.670
I had a girlfriend and we had three children.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.469
My church didn't see anything wrong with what I was doing because that was a common practice.

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:44.020
We were just married according to Cambodian tradition but we never legally registered a marriage.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.060
I got a Bible.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.859
What I learned from it really touched me.

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:58.810
I realized that I was wrong to be in a polygamous marriage.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.369
The brother who was studying the Bible with me saw a picture of my family.

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:08.689
He asked me about the picture and I told him that it was my girlfriend and my kids.

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:13.930
We then studied the lesson which talks about family life and I realized that I had to make

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.019
changes in my life.

00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:31.260
When I wanted to start preaching, I realized that Jehovah requires that we legalize a marriage.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
I had prayed.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:42.099
Oh Jehovah, if you really have drawn me and are pleased with me,

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:52.700
please help me get the birth certificate and the money needed to make the trip.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.859
This really troubled me for a very long time.

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:05.260
Another thing that made it difficult to leave him was the fact that I had 10 children.

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:11.699
But I saw that loving this man shouldn't prevent me from becoming someone worthy to God.

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:15.379
So I said, I'm leaving.

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:19.219
As for the local community, they would comment about me.

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:20.740
This lady is a rebel.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:29.830
She's got a man's children but once I did leave, I felt as if something was being lifted off of me.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.229
I went back home and got married to my wife.

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:41.270
This enabled me and my family to be together in one place, where we could serve Jehovah as a family.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.629
After I quit my job, I spent a whole year unemployed.

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:52.150
We planted some vegetables in a yard and that helped us to get by.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:59.590
To my surprise, my Bible study conductor called me and invited me to go to take care.

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:03.789
It's very far away, really far.

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:08.669
When I mentioned the names of my parents, extended family and relatives,

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:11.990
I was able to get my birth certificate.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:20.870
We submitted an application for a marriage certificate and received it two weeks later.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:27.180
My previous husband eventually became one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.699
My best friend now is the first wife from my polygamous marriage.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.340
I'm so proud to see my family serving Jehovah that they love Jehovah

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.539
and seeing them obeying Jehovah's laws.

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:46.139
I eventually got baptized.

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:51.900
I also preached to my husband and he agreed to start studying the Bible.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.419
I am really grateful to Jehovah.

00:03:55.419 --> 00:04:01.060
He is merciful to the poor and to the lowliest, like me.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.740
I fully relied on Jehovah and he made everything happen.
