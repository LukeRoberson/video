00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.779
Time keeps on ticking, the year seems to fly

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:16.780
I'm not getting younger from pain, I can't hide, but I know

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:26.730
Oh, it won't be long

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.730
I've lost loved ones at times in my life

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:45.049
And living without them has been a hard fight, but I know

00:00:45.049 --> 00:01:37.060
And I will waste words and the days where it is reduced

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.060
It is clear, my friend, you said

00:01:41.060 --> 00:02:00.500
Oh, make you hover the purpose in my life, cause I know

00:02:00.500 --> 00:03:17.430
Oh, this old world passes away

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.430
And I will win
