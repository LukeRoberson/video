00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.500
It's time for another convention.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.500
Yes, that's right, another year has gone by.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.500
Are you ready?

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.500
Before you head out, here's a few important reminders

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.500
to help make this a safe and enjoyable convention for everyone.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.500
The doors open each morning at 8 a.m.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.500
You won't be able to enter or save seats before this time.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.500
Now, of course, it's always exciting to arrive at the convention

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.500
anticipating what spiritual gems await.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.869
But when it's time to...

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:43.869
Whoa!

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:48.119
Maybe we should take another look at that.

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:52.119
As Christians, we're in a race for life, not the front row.

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:54.119
So, don't rush.

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:57.119
It's not a competition.

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:59.119
Ah, much better.

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:03.119
Self-sacrificing spirit is what identifies us as true Christians.

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:07.120
Remember, only save seats for those traveling with you,

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.120
living with you,

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.120
or studying the Bible with you.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.120
Please keep unsafe seats free of clutter.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.120
That makes it easier for others to see which ones are available.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.120
At each convention site, there is special seating for the elderly and infirm.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.120
This seating is limited,

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.120
so only one or two persons providing assistance should accompany these ones.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.120
We always want to show consideration for our dear older ones,

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.120
especially when entering and exiting the convention site.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.120
We want to be in our seats well before the musical interlude is about to begin.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.120
The program really starts at 920, when the music begins.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.120
This is an opportunity for each one of us to show appreciation for what has been provided.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.560
Try to be on time.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:08.000
But if for some reason you do arrive late, please follow the direction of the attendance.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Of course, there are some things you need to think about before even heading to the convention.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Dressing in a modest and appropriate way is how we show appreciation for others and this special occasion.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Wear shoes that are safe and comfortable.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.069
The way we dress and act serves as a good witness,

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.069
but even more important, it brings honor and joy to Jehovah.

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:42.069
First Corinthians 1024 says we should seek not our own advantage,

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.069
but that of the other person.

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.900
At the convention, we can apply that scripture in many ways,

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.900
like limiting the use of strong fragrances,

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.900
or being mindful not to block the view of others.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.900
Consideration for others is also shown in how we use our electronic devices.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.900
Don't send any unnecessary text messages or emails during the program.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.900
Set them so they won't disturb others.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.900
By the end of the morning sessions, you'll probably be hungry.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.900
So don't forget to bring your own lunch.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.900
Yes, it takes a little planning, but isn't this better?

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.900
Remember that glass containers are not permitted in the convention facility.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.180
And don't forget to bring the right size cooler.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:46.860
Eating a light lunch will help you to stay alert.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:53.860
Following these guidelines will help you to have more time during the noon break to spend with others.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.860
Will you be staying at a hotel?

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.860
Here are a few points to keep in mind.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.860
Hotels have a limited number of luggage cards,

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.860
so only take one when you need it and return it immediately for others to use.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.860
Cook only in rooms where it is permitted.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.860
If your hotel offers complimentary breakfast, coffee, or ice,

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.860
don't use these provisions to restock your cooler.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.860
Be considerate of the other guests, and only take what you need for your own breakfast.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.860
Parents should keep an eye on their children at all times,

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:40.860
including in the elevators, swimming pools, lobby areas, and exercise rooms.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.860
Even if things at your hotel are less than perfect,

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.860
display Christ-like qualities when dealing with the hotel staff.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.860
Never underestimate the power of showing kindness, patience, and reasonableness.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.860
Oh, and one last thing.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.860
If it's the custom where you live, leave a tip for the housekeeper,

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.860
and any hotel workers who help with your bag.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.860
They work hard.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.860
Speaking of work, it takes a lot of work to run a convention.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.860
Many hands can make the load life.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.860
Can you help?

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:25.170
If so, report to the volunteer service department at the convention.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.170
Even children under 16 years of age can have a share,

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:34.170
as long as they work under the direction of a parent, guardian, or an approved adult.

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:38.170
Well, the convention will be here before you know it.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.170
And now you're ready.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:45.170
Get there early so you don't miss a minute of the program,

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.170
including the music.

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.170
Bring your lunch.

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:55.170
Be mindful of your dress, grooming, and manners at all times.

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:59.480
And have a great convention.
