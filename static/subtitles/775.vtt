00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:06.379
A master builder is responsible for every aspect in the creation of a building, beginning

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:12.179
to end, including oversight of those performing the work.

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.859
Jehovah is mankind's master builder.

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:20.780
As Gilead students, soon graduates, you have the precious privilege of further supporting

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:27.899
the master builder by strengthening and stabilizing his building up Jehovah's people.

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:30.699
How can you do that successfully?

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:37.299
Well, turn to me, please, to the book of the Psalms, Psalm 127, 127 Psalm, we'll look

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:48.619
at verse 1, words of wise King Solomon, Psalm 127 and verse 1, unless Jehovah builds

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:52.939
the house, and in Hebrew, a house can also refer to family.

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:59.700
So unless Jehovah builds the house, it is in vain that its builders work hard on it,

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.619
unless Jehovah builds the house.

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:03.619
That's powerful.

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:10.140
Any endeavor, even well-intentioned that doesn't have Jehovah's blessing, will ultimately

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.099
be in vain.

00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:18.579
So to build up Jehovah's family, we have to align our efforts with Jehovah's building

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:19.579
methods.

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:23.620
So how can we or how can you successfully do that?

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.459
Build up the branch family where you're assigned.

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:28.659
But I'd like to invite you to the book of Nehemiah.

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:34.900
We'll turn to Nehemiah chapter 1, and we'll see how he applied King Solomon's wise counsel

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.180
to remember the builder, and then what lessons we can learn from him.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.500
We'll begin in chapter 1 and verse 3, where Hanani, Nehemiah's brother, is explaining

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.780
Jerusalem's sad situation.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.859
Let's pick up their conversation.

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:53.980
Verse 3, they, or Hanani and those who traveled with him, replied, those remaining there

00:01:53.980 --> 00:02:00.299
in the province who have survived the captivity are in a terrible situation, and in disgrace,

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:07.500
the walls of Jerusalem are broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.819
How did Nehemiah react when he heard that information?

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.300
Well, let's look at verse 4.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:18.180
Nehemiah says, as soon as I heard these words, I sat down and began to weep and mourn

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.180
for days.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.580
It's fasting and notice and praying before the God of the heavens.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.819
This news had a profound impact on him.

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:27.819
He wept.

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:28.819
He mourned.

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:29.819
He fasted.

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:30.819
Why?

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:31.819
Because he loved Jehovah.

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.620
Jerusalem was a center of pure worship, and he loved his brothers and sisters.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.900
But the question is, what should he do about it?

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.819
He probably wanted to jump in and fix things right away.

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.780
But did you notice how he remembered the builder?

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.580
His feelings were appropriate.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.020
Everything was needed, but he didn't get ahead of things.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.699
He took time to deal with his feelings, and it says he prayed repeatedly.

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:58.219
He focused on the builder.

00:02:58.219 --> 00:02:59.219
And it's interesting.

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:02.900
Jehovah waited some four months or so to answer those prayers.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.139
Kids left to Naisan, whereas the rebuilding itself only took about 52 days.

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:15.020
Now four months may not be a long period of time, but it's also not the next day.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.699
In either case, Nehemiah waited for Jehovah's direction.

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:23.340
And when the direction came when the king granted all of the things he had prayed for, Nehemiah

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.900
could be confident that it was Jehovah doing the building.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.900
Well you know how Nehemiah felt.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.819
You've seen Jehovah answer prayers in your life.

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:36.939
Continue to rely on prayer.

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:41.580
Even more so now as you take on new assignments and counter new situations.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.099
And yes, when you have strong feelings on a matter.

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:48.219
Remember the builder.

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:51.180
Get his direction.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.139
Another thing to remember about getting Jehovah's direction is that it's not a passive

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:56.139
process.

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:57.139
It's an active process.

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.379
While Nehemiah waited, he didn't just sit around killing time.

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:03.620
He was active in his spiritual routine and assignment.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.699
And he kept meditating on the situation, looking for solutions that Jehovah could bless,

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:12.259
and then including those in his prayers.

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:16.300
His spiritual routine helped him through the discouraging moments, and it also helped

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.579
him remain ready for when the answer did come.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.939
We know this because in Nehemiah chapter 2, verses 4 through 8, when King Arthur Zerxes

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:29.819
granted his request, he asked Nehemiah, how long would your journey be?

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:31.779
When will you return?

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:34.779
Nehemiah already had a timetable in mind.

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:39.620
Nehemiah also asked for authorization letters for the governors, and for building materials

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.939
from the keeper of the royal park.

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:46.980
Nehemiah had been waiting actively, praying, meditating.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.379
Well situations today will not always be resolved in a day.

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:55.300
But like Nehemiah, your spiritual routine will provide you with stability, and it will

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.779
help you be ready when the direction comes.

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:02.620
Another beautiful effect is that your example in the ministry and in the meetings and in your

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:09.620
assignments will also strengthen the friends, as they too face challenges, they'll be helped

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.740
to remember the builder.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.740
Another way to remember the builder is to remember Jehovah's love for people.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:23.860
Nehemiah even under difficult circumstances noticed people, turned to chapter 3.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.500
We'll look at some of the highlights here in chapter 3.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.220
Nehemiah is going around the city wall counterclockwise, but notice what he describes there

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.220
in chapter 3.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.740
We'll look first in verse 1.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.819
It says, the high priest and his brothers were building the sheep gate.

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:40.300
Look at verse 2.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.459
The men of Jericho were building.

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:44.779
Let's go down to verse 5.

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:51.019
There we see the humble to coites working hard, but the prominent ones, not so much.

00:05:51.019 --> 00:05:52.019
There's a lesson in that.

00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:54.259
Don't be a prominent to coite.

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:56.899
We all want to work on the walls.

00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:58.459
Go down to verse 12.

00:05:58.459 --> 00:06:01.939
Here we notice Shalom, who's a prince, but who's working with him?

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:06.860
His hard-working daughters tells us remind us our sisters that do so much in today's efforts

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.860
to advance kingdom interests.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:16.180
Turn to verse 20 here in the chapter, and it says, barrack worked with fervor.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:22.019
Nehemiah noticed people, and Jehovah inspired him to write about them.

00:06:22.019 --> 00:06:23.019
Why?

00:06:23.019 --> 00:06:26.819
One reason is Jehovah wants us to remember why we're building.

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:29.220
He loves people.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:35.100
We're building the walls wasn't the end goal, rather rebuilding the walls supported the

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.100
end goal.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:41.379
That of glorifying Jehovah, fulfilling prophecy, and yes, protecting Jehovah's people.

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:45.459
Those actual walls were destroyed again later, but the account of Nehemiah lives on today,

00:06:45.459 --> 00:06:49.899
and those who worked on the wall, they too hoped to live forever.

00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:51.939
So get to know the people you're building with.

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:52.939
They're wonderful people.

00:06:52.939 --> 00:07:00.019
Jehovah chooses amazing friends, and like Nehemiah, appreciate their qualities.

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:04.259
Think of your congregation and your department as a spiritual building, and the individual

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:07.459
brothers and sisters were all the stones.

00:07:07.459 --> 00:07:14.259
The mortar that binds us together is the love and consideration we show each other.

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:18.300
For those of you brothers who may contribute to decision-making when you return to your

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.899
assignments, humbly consider the ideas of others, including brothers and sisters.

00:07:22.899 --> 00:07:28.379
Brothers and sisters, under your oversight, additionally consider how a decision will

00:07:28.379 --> 00:07:30.740
affect others.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:37.220
To strengthen others, we need to know and love them, just like the builder does.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:42.819
One final thought regarding our master builder, Jehovah is a happy God, imperfection in Satan's

00:07:42.819 --> 00:07:44.060
system caused suffering.

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.060
That's true.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:50.899
But remember that serving Jehovah brings joy despite those challenges.

00:07:50.899 --> 00:07:53.660
And there is strength in that joy.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:57.980
After completing the wall in Nehemiah, chapter 8, verse 10, Nehemiah reminded the people

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:03.420
that the joy of Jehovah was their stronghold, knowing that they had done Jehovah's will

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.740
and had Jehovah's approval gave them strength.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:09.139
And that had an impact in them.

00:08:09.139 --> 00:08:16.139
Notice that in Nehemiah chapter 12, Nehemiah chapter 12, verse 43.

00:08:16.139 --> 00:08:20.860
This verse talks about the day of inauguration after all of the challenges had been overcome,

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.139
and notice how the people felt.

00:08:23.139 --> 00:08:25.980
1243.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:32.980
On that day, they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced for the true God made them rejoice,

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:34.379
with great joy.

00:08:34.379 --> 00:08:40.740
The women and the children also rejoiced so that the rejoicing of Jerusalem could be heard

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:46.100
far away, even with brand new high walls they could be heard at a distance.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.899
Sounds like the joyful noise before our meetings and assemblies are even here this morning

00:08:49.899 --> 00:08:52.179
before your graduation program.

00:08:52.179 --> 00:08:53.419
But did you notice?

00:08:53.419 --> 00:09:00.700
It was Jehovah who made them rejoice, despite the challenges now and those to come, strengthen

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:05.139
others by remembering to enjoy Jehovah's service.

00:09:05.139 --> 00:09:07.940
He's a happy God.

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:15.340
The psalmist said, unless Jehovah builds the house, well, Jehovah is building the house,

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:19.860
and you dear graduates, along with all of us, have the wonderful privilege of working

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.940
alongside him in this building work.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:26.820
As you strengthen and stabilize Jehovah's people, humbly remember the builder.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.500
Seek his direction and prayer.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.980
Stay busy in your spiritual routine.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:35.179
Love the brothers and sisters, and enjoy serving Jehovah.

00:09:35.179 --> 00:09:41.860
Like Nehemiah, your guaranteed success, and Jehovah will remember you favorably when

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:44.019
you remember the builder.
