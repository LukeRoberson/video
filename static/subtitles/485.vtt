WEBVTT

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:08.210
We'd like to begin our discussion with the importance of buying truth personally

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:11.109
And no one else can do that for us

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:17.329
And then we'll talk just for a moment about how much effort it takes to do that

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.449
Let's begin our discussion with something that happened to King David of Israel

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.230
He wanted to buy a threshing floor from a man named Arona

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.229
And he wanted to offer up sacrifices to Jehovah

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:40.189
But Arona they land on her said look David take the threshing floor. I'll give you the cattle

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:43.670
I'll give you whatever you need just take it and worship Jehovah

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:46.189
But how did David respond?

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.990
At 2 Samuel 24 verse 24 he said this I will not offer up to Jehovah my God

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.509
Burnt sacrifices that cost me nothing

00:00:57.509 --> 00:01:03.009
David realized that it had to be his personal sacrifice in order for it to have value

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:10.239
Likewise when we buy truth we have to pay for it and affect ourselves

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.640
How much effort does it take?

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.319
Well, let's open our Bibles to the book of 2 Peter chapter 1 and

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.319
Let's look at a couple of expressions here that will help us to appreciate

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.120
The effort that's required

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.120
2 Peter chapter 1 verse 5

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.599
For this very reason put forth all earnest effort to supply to your faith

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.040
Virtue to your virtue

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.959
Knowledge

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:47.000
So we're always having to add to supply to our knowledge of the truth and what kind of effort earnest effort

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.120
sincere

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.120
Strenuous with depth of feeling

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:53.480
conscientious

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.159
And how about this matter of supplying knowledge?

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:04.760
The original Greek now here used meant leader of a chorus. What does that have to do with supply?

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:09.240
Well back in the day when this was written

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.919
If a city wanted to put on a stage play and they had a chorus

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.080
Men of the city who had money would actually go into their own pockets and

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.240
pay for the training and the maintenance of that chorus for the city and

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.280
They had to spend a lot, but they were willing to do it for what they consider to be a worthy cause

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.199
So it was a personal sacrifice on their part

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.560
So likewise no one else can

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.080
Read for us

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.080
Study for us research for us

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.719
Meditate for us. It has to be personal and it has to be done sincerely

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.319
But now you know, though we get the truth and we're glad that we have

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:55.599
We want to make sure that we never sell it. We never lose it

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.039
Now these are expressions by and sell their business expressions, aren't they?

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.639
Well, let's see what principles in the Bible can help us to be on guard

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:13.360
Against the devil in this system who are always trying to get us to sell or to get rid of our truth

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.919
Let's go this time to the book of Proverbs chapter 20 and we want to look at verse 14

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.120
Proverbs 20 verse 14

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.840
Now this is a dishonest businessman and notice what he does

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:32.319
It is no good. It is no good says the buyer

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.560
Then he goes away and boasts about himself

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.800
So he sees something he wants

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:41.759
But he doesn't want to pay the the value

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.319
So he runs down the product. He criticizes it. It makes it look like it's inferior and then the seller if he's not

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.840
Aware and alert. He will actually sell his product for far less than it's worth

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.879
Practically nothing and then this dishonest buyer goes off and he brags about it

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.080
well

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.560
Buyers are not the only ones that can be dishonest

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.280
Sellers can be dishonest too can't they this is the product you need is exactly what you want

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.040
But they don't tell you about the long history of problems that it's has

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.800
They don't tell about the cost that it takes to maintain it

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.879
And the difficulties that come with owning that product all they want you to do is buy this beautiful product

00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:34.519
Well, how can we take that principle and apply it to what Satan and his system tries to do to

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.560
us

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.560
Jehovah warned about those who say this as recorded at Isaiah 520

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.920
Woe to those who say that good is bad and bad is good

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.480
So Satan with all of his cunning and his deception

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:56.879
Well try to say to us you know that truth that you purchased

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
That was a bad purchase

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.519
It's too burdensome

00:05:01.519 --> 00:05:03.519
It took away your freedom

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.600
You've lost your independence

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.319
Now I've got some products that will really make you happy right now

00:05:12.079 --> 00:05:18.399
Well, we know that in the business world the buyer always has to separate the facts

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:21.439
from the salesman's

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.079
Empty or foolish talk or his nonsense not all salesman like that but many are

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.879
So we have to be careful that we don't buy into something that seems so good

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.360
But in reality

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.360
Doesn't have value at all

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:46.000
So how do we fight all of this propaganda from the system of things around us to make us feel that we made a bad purchase

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.480
with the truth

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.519
Well, we have a very good example in Jesus

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.480
Remember the time when the devil came to him is recorded in Matthew chapter 4

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.120
And the devil said to him

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:03.120
I'm going to give you all the kingdoms of the world in their glory

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.639
And all you have to do is one act of worship to me

00:06:08.079 --> 00:06:10.079
How did Jesus respond

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.560
Go away Satan

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.720
He knew that that was a lie and he knew it was nonsense

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:20.079
But how did he support and protect his truth

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.800
He went to the truth

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.879
He said to Satan it is written

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:31.120
It is Jehovah your God you must worship and it is to him alone you must render sacred service

00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:33.439
Well

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:35.279
That was the truth from God's word

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.680
And that's how we can protect our truth that we've worked so hard

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.040
To obtain and to maintain

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000
We use the scriptures the truth from Jehovah to defend our precious purchase

00:06:50.720 --> 00:07:00.399
So may we continue to do that and not be fooled by the system of things and all of its glitter that it says it wants to give to us

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.360
Now and considering what we've talked about thus far

00:07:06.079 --> 00:07:08.079
personal effort

00:07:08.079 --> 00:07:11.439
And never letting the truth go because we viewed it so valuable

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.439
We can talk just briefly about the Apostle Paul

00:07:16.079 --> 00:07:20.240
At Acts chapter 22 and verse 3

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.800
He talked about his previous education obtaining knowledge

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.519
And he said I was educated at the feet of Gamaliel

00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:35.439
And instructed according to the strictness of the ancestral law and zealous for God

00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:38.720
Saul as he was known then

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:45.040
Was being trained at the feet of one of the most famous and renowned teachers in the first century Gamaliel

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.100
What did Gamaliel teach

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:58.939
He promoted belief in the oral law and he placed greater emphasis on the oral law than the inspired scriptures

00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:05.579
So when the Hebrew scriptures didn't say specifically or explicitly what a person should do

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:11.339
Men like Gamaliel would came up with all of these oral traditions through the years

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.139
And they knew them well and the rabbis

00:08:14.699 --> 00:08:17.660
Would make the decision for the person not the person

00:08:18.699 --> 00:08:19.579
In fact

00:08:19.579 --> 00:08:25.660
Gamaliel was so esteemed that he was the first to be called rabbi which was a title higher than a rabbi

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:30.699
And Paul had to learn all of this oral tradition

00:08:32.139 --> 00:08:37.419
And research shows that it was a very painstaking relentless training program

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:42.700
Where they had to memorize all of these voluminous laws and make it their own

00:08:44.299 --> 00:08:46.299
There would be benefits in the secular world

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.620
prestige

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.299
But when Paul learned the truth

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.220
What did he do?

00:08:56.299 --> 00:08:59.980
He came to appreciate Mark 7 and 7 and 8 when Jesus said

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.940
It is in vain that they keep worshiping me

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.980
For they teach commands of men as doctrines

00:09:07.019 --> 00:09:10.460
You let go the commandment of God and cling to the tradition of men

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:14.460
So Paul understood he thought he had something of value

00:09:15.419 --> 00:09:17.419
But it was all in vain

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:21.019
And from the time that he accepted in both the truth

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:23.980
He never let it go did he?

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:30.299
Regardless of the pain and the suffering and the sacrifices he made he considered it all worth it

00:09:31.179 --> 00:09:36.139
What a fine example of personally buying at great sacrifice

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.820
And as the years went by

00:09:40.299 --> 00:09:42.139
Paul never sold the truth, it he

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.019
At Philippians chapter 3

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.259
He talked about his life as a servant of God

00:09:50.379 --> 00:09:51.580
And he had no regrets

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.179
He said what he gave up was a lot of refuse

00:09:55.899 --> 00:10:00.460
And the original terms here could indicate dung or food garbage

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.019
He made the right purchase didn't he

00:10:04.059 --> 00:10:06.940
And when he taught and when he wrote an inspiration

00:10:07.659 --> 00:10:12.220
We do not hear the Apostle Paul say when I was with Gamelil this is what he said

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.299
Or Gamelil would do this in this case never

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.179
He always went back to the real truth

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.899
The truth from Jehovah's inspired word

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.220
What a fine example for us all

00:10:24.779 --> 00:10:25.980
So what have we learned this morning?

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:31.340
Truth is valuable and it's worth every personal effort to attain it

00:10:32.139 --> 00:10:32.940
But be careful

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.940
Don't let the devil fool us into believing we made a bad purchase

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.100
Resist the devil in this system

00:10:40.139 --> 00:10:43.659
And as a result we'll have no regrets over our decision

00:10:44.379 --> 00:10:48.700
We'll always be so grateful that we took the time and effort to buy truth

00:10:49.179 --> 00:10:52.460
And we've held onto it and then the God of truth

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:57.340
We'll reward us for everlasting with everlasting life
