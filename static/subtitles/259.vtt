00:00:02.799 --> 00:00:07.799
Many young ones have faced the challenge of what they should do with their lives.

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.800
Two Christians now look back at the decision they faced as youths.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.800
Levi grew up in a religiously divided household and was encouraged by nonwoodish family members

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.800
to pursue a football career.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.800
And Susan was pursuing a career in music when she began studying the Bible.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:34.090
I loved football.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.090
To be honest with you, I loved it all.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.090
The excitement.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.090
I like the running, the energy.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.500
Well, I really was drawn to opera.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.500
I love classical music.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.500
You feel like you're communicating with your audience.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.500
It's just fantastic.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.500
I was ranked in the number three running back in the nation at one point.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.500
And generally I was on the front page of the sports.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.500
My first professional job was as an understudy at the Eugene Opera in Oregon.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.500
I spent several summers in young artists' programs, Central City Opera, the Aldabra Festival.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.500
I sang at the Tango Wood Festival.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.500
I was recruited by all the top colleges.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.500
But I picked USC to go visit January 12th of 1990.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.500
I went to the Coliseum and they told me that thousands of people will be yelling your name.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.500
And then I saw my name up in lights.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.500
There was a screen that said, Levi, we want you.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.900
I'm like, wow, this is cool.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.750
I was baptized on July 31st, 1993.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.750
I did feel some nagging doubts about what I was doing with my opera career.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.750
And there was a scripture that was very important to me, 2 Corinthians 5-15,

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.750
that we might live for the one who died for us and not for ourselves.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.219
And that scripture had a big impact on me because I was living for myself.

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.219
My dad explained the Bible Principles Association with the World,

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:12.219
the type of atmosphere that football brings you into,

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:14.219
as well as what I want to do in the future.

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:17.219
As far as serving Jehovah, I couldn't do both.

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:26.810
Well, in the plane ride home, I started a formal witnessing to a lady that was sitting next to me.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.810
It clicked in my mind that, listen, you're trying to explain to her how to live.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.810
Yet look at you.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.810
I found I didn't get the same joy in my singing that I had before.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.810
And I thought, you know, I really can give this up.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.810
So I decided to quit.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.699
He was on the front page of newspaper,

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:54.810
leave I decided to carry a Bible instead of a football.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.810
I told Jehovah I would give him all I had.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.810
So I wanted to get baptized.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.810
I started pioneering in 91.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.810
I got accepted to Bethel in October of 91.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.060
To left Bethel to get married.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.060
We started pioneering together in Tulso, Oklahoma,

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.060
where we've been serving a congregation as pioneers for the past seven years.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.060
I began regular pioneering.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.060
And of course, my life changed.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.060
And I found great fulfillment in my pioneering.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.060
It was also during that time that I met my future husband.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.060
And he was a Bethelite for many years.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.060
So I've been at Bethel five years now.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.060
Right now, I'm a far fighter.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.060
I work for a city of about 600,000.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.060
The nice thing about my schedule is I work one day on and I'm off two days.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.060
And so that schedule allows me to pioneer to support my wife in a nice way.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.060
I work as a housekeeper.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.060
And it's not a glamorous work.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.060
But working at Bethel is really not about the work you do.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.060
Being at Bethel is about being in a spiritual environment, helping your brothers.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.060
And there are some tremendous benefits of being at Bethel.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.060
I love morning worship.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.060
I love the Bethel lectures that we get once a month.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:20.060
And it's a great privilege to actually to know and be known by those who are Christ's brothers.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:26.930
That's a very rare privilege that I treasure.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.930
I'd say it's not possible to be dedicated to the sport and to Jehovah at the same time.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.930
Being focused in your service at Jehovah requires that you give them your all.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.930
What sports is going to take a large part of your time.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.930
You have to practice to get stronger, faster in order to be dedicated to your sport.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:44.930
It requires time.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.930
And so doing both is realistically not possible.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.930
If we're really going to give to Jehovah, then we should do it whole-sold.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.930
It should be everything to us.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.930
And music really asks you to be whole-sold also, well, you don't have two souls.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:06.930
So either you're going to go with whole-sold to Jehovah or you're going to end up whole-sold to your music.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.930
I miss, don't get me wrong.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:17.930
I see constantly in the paper these gentlemen I played sports with signing $4.5 million contracts, $8.9 million contracts.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.930
So you look back at those things.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:25.930
But at the same time, the things I've gained, they outweigh anything that I possibly could have had in the past.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.930
The friendship, the organization, the brotherhood, you can't replace those.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.930
Sometimes I see people I went to Juilliard with.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.930
I see their names in the newspaper.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.930
I hear about them on the radio, the wonderful things they've done with their careers.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.930
And I'm happy for them. I really am.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.930
Because I know that that's all they know.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.930
I think about where I would be.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.930
Because there's no guarantee.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.930
The world, it doesn't guarantee you anything.

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:51.930
You can hurt a leg.

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.930
You can break it back.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.930
And where would you be?

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.930
Anything you have out there in the world, it's transient.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.930
It's fraught with difficulties.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.930
You know, it looks so great.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.930
And all you see is how good it is.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:06.930
You don't see the price tag.

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:07.930
They want to use you.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:08.930
They want to get all they can out of you.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.930
You're like a disposable cup.

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.930
They use you and they throw you away.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.930
Well, I don't really feel like I've lost everything.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.930
Because really, I've gained everything.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.930
I have a great husband.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:20.930
I have a great life.

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.930
I have a great future.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.930
No regrets.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.930
I can say that 100% there are no regrets at all.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.930
I'm happy with my service at Jehovah.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.930
I'm happy with all the blessings he's giving me now.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:35.930
I'm happy.
