00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:17.140
Where you go, you will have family near

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.140
Because wherever you go

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.140
Jehovah's people are there

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.140
And you'll feel low

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.140
You'll feel low for brotherly love

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.179
So feel the love

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:49.210
Mr. Solo, but the world you hold

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.210
And follow his son

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.210
To bring you love

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.210
A nation now

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:22.859
It's for us all

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:44.230
These are on islands apart

00:01:44.230 --> 00:03:02.590
Can be missionation

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.590
Jehovah's love
