00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:14.460
It's early October in Jersey City.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.460
Jehovah's Witnesses in the United States eagerly prepared to welcome thousands of visitors.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.460
They came from 84 countries to attend a special meeting.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.460
We met friends from the Fiji.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.460
We met friends that are serving in Thailand.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.460
We come from Madagascar.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.460
Serving in Nigeria, Branch.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.460
This is the first time that Armenian delegates are invited.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.460
We're visiting from the Mexico branch.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.460
We're from the Dominican Republic and we're really excited to be here for the annual meeting.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.460
We are from Peru.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.460
We are from Sri Lanka.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.460
I'm from the Basel in London.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.460
I'm from Iraq, but we are living now in Norway.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.460
It's a high point of the year.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.460
A time when you learn about how God spirited operating all over the world.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.460
Renewing acquaintances and making new friends and seeing old faces.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.460
It's kind of like a big family reunion.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.459
I just feel privileged to be here.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:07.459
It's my first time.

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:13.459
This meeting is held each year at the Stanley Theater, built in 1928.

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:18.459
It was one of the largest theaters in the country and one of the finest.

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:22.799
In time, it fell into disrepair.

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.799
In 1983, we purchased the building and fully restored it to its original condition.

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.340
The Stanley serves as a beautiful setting for this eagerly anticipated three-hour program.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:47.239
Some of the visitors watch from satellite locations.

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:51.239
All are excited as the program is about to begin.

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:55.239
The chairman, Anthony Morris, referred to previous annual meetings.

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:57.239
And then...

00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:59.239
What will we hear this year?

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:09.530
Will we hear any clarification of understanding of Scripture?

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.530
We shall see.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.530
Next came a video update describing the building of Kingdom Halls

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.530
in lands with limited resources.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.530
Another video featured highlights of recent special conventions.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.530
Christopher Mayver then interviewed long-time faithful witnesses

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.530
from Germany, Spain, and Malawi.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.530
After that, the audience enjoyed an exciting report

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.530
chaired by Gary Bro on public witnessing in Manhattan.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.530
At just one table in two days, 14 Bible studies were started.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.530
Many of them, the conversation went like this.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.530
Are you Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.530
Yes, we are.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.530
Is it true that you offer for free home Bible studies?

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.530
After we reassured them that yes, they had heard correctly.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.530
They said, how do I sign up for one?

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.530
Brother Morris introduced another video on the making of Become Jehovah's Friend.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:16.539
Characters, props, and sets are designed.

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:20.539
Then these sculptures have to be given a skin.

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:24.539
And the skin has to be painted.

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:32.539
Hundreds of controls are added to a character similar to the bones and muscles in the human body.

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:40.199
Would you like to see the one-minute lesson that's going to be posted in January?

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:47.669
After viewing a new one-minute animation, those on hand were treated to a live performance.

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.669
Going to sing on the stage.

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:53.669
We're singing song 120 plays in obey and be blessed.

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:59.669
Now, speaking of song 120 as sung by our precious children,

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:03.669
would you like to hear that song one more time?

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:53.319
After the joyful singing, the rest of the program focused on a clarified understanding

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:57.319
of Matthew 24, 45 to 47.

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:02.319
First, Jeffrey Jackson considered the topic, how is spiritual food prepared?

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:05.319
He then gave a preview of what was to come.

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:10.319
So you'll be interested to note that the next series of five talks,

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:13.319
each of them given by a governing body member,

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:18.319
is about to adjust our understanding of a very treasured subject.

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:23.319
Next, Garrett Lush answered the question, which channel is Jehovah using?

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:27.319
Faithful slave show that it wouldn't be easy to find out

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:30.319
and that different views would prevail.

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:33.319
There would be various wrong views as well.

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:35.319
Another question.

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:38.319
Since the domestics are fed by the slave,

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:43.319
are the individual elected, the only ones who need to be fed

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:51.319
as domestics by the slave or thus the expression domestics include others as well?

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:53.319
Then, Guy Pierce highlighted the subject.

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:56.319
Tell us, when will these things work?

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:58.319
Faithfully now, during this period of time,

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:01.319
it would take some time to see them doing so,

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:04.319
and then finally, verse 47, truly, I say to you,

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:09.319
he will appoint him over all his belongings.

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:13.660
So when does the Faithful slave receive the two appointments?

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.660
So we mentioned one in 1919.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.660
The other is yet to come in the future.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.660
In your future, we look forward to seeing that happen.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.660
Samuel Heard gave the talk,

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.660
feeding many through the hands of a few.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.660
Jesus fed many through the hands of a few.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.660
He did so when providing material food,

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.660
and he followed that same pattern

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.660
when feeding the first century follower spiritually.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.660
Next, Stephen Lett considered,

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.660
who really is the Faithful and Discreet slave?

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.660
What about anointed brothers who make up the Faithful slave?

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.660
Well, they too need to be fed spiritually.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.660
So these brothers humbly recognize

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:58.660
that as individuals, they are simply domestics,

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.660
like all others of Jesus followers.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.660
David's plane concluded with,

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.660
what does all of this really mean?

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.660
But then, as the great crowd made its appearance,

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.660
they too needed to be fed.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.660
And so the great crowd and the anointed

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.660
are all domestics.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.660
We are all domestics.

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.660
And brothers, we love this teaching.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.660
We love this idea because it really,

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:39.060
truly does dignify the members of the great crowd.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.060
After a closing prayer by Mark Sanderson,

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.060
the visitors went home happy and encouraged.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:49.060
Eager to share with others the good things they had learned.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.060
Such an amazing example of divine education.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.060
One of the highlights that I really, really liked

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.060
was when the kids were singing.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.060
And I was so impressed with the program today.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:01.060
I really appreciated the kids singing.

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:05.060
From the little ones to the older ones who were interviewed.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:08.060
I especially enjoyed all the new developments

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.060
happening around the world,

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.060
and really shows how Jehovah's speeding up the work.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:15.060
To see the governing bodies love for all of us friends.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.060
And I think it was a marvelous,

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.060
really marvelous event today.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.060
Not to be missed.
