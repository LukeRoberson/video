00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:16.449
Nearly all religions teach that part of a person survives death.

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.449
But what does the Bible teach?

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.449
God created the first man, Adam, from the dust.

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.449
He had the opportunity to live forever.

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.449
But when he deliberately disobeyed God,

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:37.450
he was told that he would return to the dust, ceasing to exist.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.450
What about others who died after Adam?

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.450
When Jesus was told that his friend Lazarus died,

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.450
Jesus did not say that Lazarus had gone to heaven.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.450
Rather, he said,

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.450
our friend has fallen asleep.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:59.030
What did he mean?

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.030
Justice someone in a deep sleep is inactive and unaware of his surroundings.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.030
The dead are not conscious of anything at all.

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:16.439
Further, just as the person can be awakened from a deep sleep,

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.439
the Bible shows that it is possible to be awakened from death.

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.439
Jesus did just that for his friend Lazarus.

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:33.310
Lazarus had been dead for four days.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.310
If some part of Lazarus had survived his death and gone to heaven,

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.310
would Jesus take him out of heaven and force him to live on earth again?

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.310
No.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.310
Lazarus was asleep in the grave.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.310
Jesus gave him back his life and reunited him with his family.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.310
The Bible promises the time when many people will be resurrected from the dead,

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.310
just as Lazarus was.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.310
Jesus spoke of this wonderful hope when he said,

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.310
the one who exercises faith in me,

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.310
even though he dies, will come to life.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:19.180
What is the resurrection?

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.180
How can you cope with the pain of grief?

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:32.509
