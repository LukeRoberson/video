00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.279
There are still many areas here in Madagascar without any publishers.

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:13.279
Jesus' command was disciples to go out and preach definitely still applies in our territory.

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:16.280
I want to take part in fulfilling prophecy.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.280
Watching the broadcast has also helped me.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.280
I am so glad I could have a share in this work.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.280
This time we had so many publishers who wanted to take part

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.280
that we had to add more territories to preaching.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.280
I hope that in the future each one of these territories will become a congregation.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.280
The journey was difficult and painful at times,

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.280
but when we got there, all we were so happy.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.280
Being with 80 publishers, all with different personalities,

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.280
really helped me to make changes to myself because we have to get along together.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.280
Preaching the people of a different culture was amazing

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.280
and seeing Jehovah's wonderful creation made me so happy.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.280
Last year I made a lot of new friends,

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.280
but this year I got to know even more people

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.280
because my new friends brought along their parents and others.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.280
All the brothers and sisters were so happy,

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.280
showing unity and love.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.329
Even though we all came from different regions,

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:22.329
many householders were interested and we faced no opposition.

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:28.700
We made many return visits and started many Bible studies.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.700
This was the best and most enjoyable time that we have ever had in the ministry.
