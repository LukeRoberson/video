00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:32.899
There is a need in each heart, God put within from the star, yearning to know what life is for.

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:47.939
First thing for something more, though some may search and despair, God's Word has always been there.

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:57.939
Words that bring hope, joy that is real, happiness I can feel.

00:00:57.939 --> 00:02:37.240
I'll approach above his light, follow trust in that heal, prove that heal.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:03:50.460
Hear that heal, prove that heal.
