00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.580
Our text comments mention our dealings with unbelieving family members,

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.580
and the need for us to put our loyalty to Jehovah ahead of our love for them.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.580
Now that raises some questions.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.579
Why might loyalty to Jehovah over love for family be an issue?

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:25.579
Is there a Bible character who set an example for us in putting loyalty to Jehovah ahead of love for family?

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:32.579
And how can we display loyalty to Jehovah while still showing love to our unbelieving family members?

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.579
Our first question.

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.579
Why at times is loyalty to Jehovah over love for family and issue?

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.579
Well, Jesus said it would be.

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.579
Please turn with me to Matthew chapter 10.

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:50.579
And here Jesus explained that one effect of a person becoming a Christian would be that relatives might oppose.

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.579
Matthew chapter 10, notice verses 34 and 35.

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:00.179
Do not think I came to bring peace to the earth.

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:03.179
I came to bring not peace, but a sword.

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:11.180
For I came to cause division with a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:21.180
Now in saying do not think I came to bring peace, Jesus meant that some of his listeners needed to think of the consequences of becoming his follower.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.180
Holding faithfully to his teachings would be challenging if family members would reject the truth.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.180
And perhaps some of us have experienced that.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.180
When we became Jehovah's Witnesses, we were opposed by our family.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.180
Perhaps we're still being opposed.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:45.180
Or they may have opposed our decisions to set and achieve spiritual goals such as pioneering or coming to Bethel.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.180
This was true of one member of our Bethel family.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.180
When this brother accepted the truth as a young person, he stated that his father was very disappointed in him.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.180
His father was confused.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:02.180
Since prior to studying the Bible, this brother's worldly pursuits were turning out well.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.180
And then when our brother was invited to Bethel, he stated that his father was really puzzled and concerned.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.180
He felt that his son was not making right choices in life.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.180
The brother wrote this.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.180
My dad had always been a loving and responsible father.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.180
We lacked nothing and had his active support.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.180
Now, I felt like I was letting him down.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.180
As if I was turning my back on him and not showing him the appreciation that a father deserves.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.180
This was hard for me.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.180
The brother's feelings were real.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.180
And it's true, we don't want to hurt our family.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.180
It's normal to love our unbelieving family members.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.180
So why the issue?

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:52.180
Because we've decided and proved by our dedication that we're going to put our loyalty to Jehovah ahead of our love for family.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.180
And when some family members realize that, they may feel that we're rejecting them.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:05.500
And that can create a division like that caused by a sword as Jesus stated here at Matthew chapter 10.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:12.500
Is there a Bible character who set an example of loyalty to Jehovah over love for family?

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.500
Well, how about this individual on our monitors?

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.500
Jonathan, the son of King Saul.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:26.500
Shortly after David defeated Goliath, first Samuel 18 tells us that Jonathan and David became bound together in close friendship.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.500
They made a covenant because Jonathan loved David as himself.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.500
So for the rest of his life, Jonathan was loyal to David, Jehovah's chosen one.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.500
And thus, Jonathan was loyal to Jehovah.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.500
Now, as we know in time, Jonathan's father King Saul was determined to kill David.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.500
So Jonathan faced a conflict of loyalties.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.500
Would he continue to put his loyalty to Jehovah ahead of his love for family?

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.500
We know he did.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.500
But look at the division that resulted in.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.500
Please turn with me to 1 Samuel, chapter 20.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.500
And let's read together verses 30 through 33.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.500
Notice the division between Jonathan and his father.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.500
1 Samuel 20, verse 30.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.500
Then Saul became enraged with Jonathan and said to him,

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:27.500
You son of a rebellious woman, do you think I do not know that you are choosing to side with the son of Jesse

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.500
to your own shame and to the shame of your mother?

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.500
As long as the son of Jesse is alive on the earth,

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.500
you and your kingship will not be firmly established.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.500
So now send someone to bring him to me, for he must die.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.500
However, Jonathan said to his Saul, his father,

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.500
Why should he be put to death?

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.500
What has he done?

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.500
At that Saul hurled the spirit him to strike him.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.500
So Jonathan knew that his father was determined to put David to death.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.500
Talk about family opposition.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.500
A few of any of us have experienced that type of response from unbelieving relatives.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.500
So what would Jonathan do?

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.500
Would he begin to reason that he needed to now change his priorities

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.500
and put love of family ahead of loyalty to Jehovah?

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.500
The answer is in verse 42.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.500
Jonathan said to David,

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.500
Go in peace.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.500
Since we have both sworn in the name of Jehovah,

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.500
saying,

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:33.500
May Jehovah be between you and me and between your offspring and my offspring forever.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.500
So loyalty to God had first place in Jonathan's heart,

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.500
and he proved his loyalty to Jehovah ahead of his love for family.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.500
Now he still supported and cooperated with his father when possible.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.500
How do we know him?

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.500
When the Philistines were battling Israel,

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.500
1st Samuel chapter 31 verse 2 states,

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:59.500
the Philistines kept in close range of Saul and his sons,

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.500
and the Philistines struck down Jonathan,

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.500
Abinadab and Malkashua, Saul's sons.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.500
So Jonathan supported his father down to the end of his life,

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.500
yet Jonathan's loyalty was with Jehovah.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.500
What an outstanding example for those of us with unbelieving family members.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.500
We still love them, we still support them as we're able,

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.500
but we put our loyalty to Jehovah ahead of our love for them.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.500
Now how can we display Jonathan like loyalty to Jehovah

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.500
and still show love for our unbelieving family members?

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.500
That's our third question.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.500
What we can let Bible principles guide us.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.500
Here are five principles that can help,

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.500
four of which appeared in the Watchtower article

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.500
that our comments are taken from.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:52.500
Point one, if conflicts arise with unbelieving family members,

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.500
try to reason with them in a loving way.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.500
Earlier we read 1st Samuel 2032,

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.500
where Jonathan tried to reason with Saul about David.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.500
Remember the questions he asked?

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.500
Why should he be put to death?

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.500
What has he done?

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.500
Of course, reasoning may not always work as it didn't with Saul,

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.500
but it doesn't mean we shouldn't try.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:18.500
Point two, have empathy for unbelieving relatives.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.500
Try to see things from their viewpoint

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.500
and listen carefully to understand their concerns.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.500
Proverbs 20 verse five states,

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.500
the thoughts of a man's heart are like deep waters,

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:32.500
but the discerning man draws them out.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.500
Point three, speak with mildness.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.500
We can ask Jehovah for his Holy Spirit to display its fruitage

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.500
when speaking with our relatives.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.500
If they hurt us by their speech or actions,

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.500
we can do his 1st Corinthians chapter four

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.500
verses 12 and 13 states.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.500
When insulted, we bless.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.500
When persecuted, we patiently endure.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:58.500
When slandered, we answer mildly.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:02.500
Point four, maintain fine conduct.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.500
Although mild speech is helpful in dealing with opposing relatives,

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.500
our good conduct can speak even louder.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.500
For speeder 316 states maintain a good conscience

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.500
so that in whatever way you are spoken against,

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.500
those who speak against you may be put to shame

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:23.500
because of your good conduct as followers of Christ.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.500
And point five, plan ahead.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.500
Proverbs 22, three,

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.500
the shrewd one sees the danger and conceals himself.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.500
Now, not that we should conceal ourselves from our unbelieving relatives,

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.500
but rather when visiting them, think of situations or topics

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.500
that might lead to conflict

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.500
and determine how to handle them ahead of time.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.500
So those are five Bible principles

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.500
that can help us to display love to our unbelieving relatives

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.500
and still prove our loyalty to Jehovah.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.500
How did things work out for the Bethelite we mentioned earlier?

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.500
His father stated,

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:01.500
My son's determination and seriousness was convincing

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.500
and helped me to appreciate that he was serious about his decision

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.500
to serve Jehovah.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.500
Later, when I visited Bethel,

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:12.500
I was thoroughly impressed with the cleanliness and organization.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:16.500
I was convinced that he made the right decision.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.500
The son concludes,

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.500
My dad is now serving Jehovah.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.500
He is a regular pioneer with my mom

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:27.500
and we serve on the same body of elders.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:31.500
As was the case with this brother and Jonathan the son of Saul,

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:34.500
let's continue to put our loyalty to Jehovah

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.500
ahead of our love for family.
