00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:07.879
We know what the future holds, Bible prophecy clearly indicates that we are living in the last days.

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:13.880
We understand what events will lead to Amageddon and the arrival of God's new world.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.879
However, we do not know the exact events that will experience personally.

00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:26.879
For example, you might wonder, will I experience a natural disaster?

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:29.879
And if so, what kind of disaster?

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:32.880
How will persecution affect me?

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.880
Will I end up in prison as I get older?

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.880
Who will care for me?

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.880
Have you ever asked yourself similar questions?

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.880
Has this uncertainty made you anxious or fearful?

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.880
Such feelings can make it hard to think clearly.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:00.880
But these feelings can go away when we realize that we are well prepared.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.879
For example, do you remember the future drama from the 2023 Convention?

00:01:06.879 --> 00:01:09.879
Commit your way to Jehovah?

00:01:09.879 --> 00:01:18.879
It illustrated how following the organization's direction saved lives during times of political unrest.

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:27.579
But is there anything else we can do to be fully equipped for tomorrow?

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:33.579
Absolutely. In fact, we are preparing ourselves every day.

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:40.579
Let's review what we are already doing and why we really have no reason to be fearful or anxious.

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:48.239
The Apostle Peter wrote his letters during times of trials and instability.

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:57.239
The brothers and sisters of the first century knew they were living in the last days of the Jewish system of things.

00:01:57.239 --> 00:02:02.239
Based on Jesus' warning, they expected personal challenges.

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:09.550
However, they did not know exactly when and how these events would affect them.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:16.960
It was impossible for them to plan for every possibility.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:25.960
Peter, who was getting older, may have wondered how he and other elderly ones would be cared for later in life.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:33.960
He may have perceived that aging and declining health could create uncertainty and fear in some.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.370
Doesn't that sound a lot like the situation we were in today?

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.370
What did the Apostle Peter recommend in view of future uncertainties?

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.370
At 1 Peter 1 verse 13, he said,

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.370
So brace up your minds for activity.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.370
Keep your senses completely.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:07.370
Set your hope on the undeserved kindness that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.370
So did Peter tell the brothers and sisters to stockpile money or supplies? No.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.370
He encouraged them to strengthen their faith and trust in Jehovah.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.370
There are no uncertainties for Jehovah.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.370
He had promised to protect the Christians in the first century, and he would provide salvation.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:37.710
In verse 13, what are the three things Peter encouraged Christians to do?

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:43.710
One, brace up your minds for activity.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:48.710
Two, keep your senses completely.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:53.710
And three, set your hope on the undeserved kindness.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:59.710
Let's look at each point and see what helps us to be fully equipped for tomorrow.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:06.819
First, Peter tells us to brace up our minds for activity.

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:13.819
Brace up means to be ready for activity. What kind of activity?

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:21.819
Among other forms of activity, notice what Peter wrote a little later in his letter at 1 Peter 2 verse 9.

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:29.819
You should declare abroad the excellencies of the one who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:37.819
In the first century, Christians were active in telling others the good news about Jesus Christ.

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:39.819
We do the same today.

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:47.819
We are active in the ministry, sharing the good news that Jesus is king in heaven, and we speak about the hope for all.

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:56.139
Now, how does this sharing in this activity prepare us for the uncertainties of tomorrow?

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:04.699
Talking to others about our hope for the future, strengthens our own conviction and faith.

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:11.699
This ministry keeps us focused, and we see the positive changes in those we teach.

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:21.019
Sharing in this activity depends our gratitude for being part of Jehovah's family.

00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:26.019
Has this gratitude motivated you to be active in the ministry?

00:05:26.019 --> 00:05:32.019
Maybe your circumstances even allow you to share in full-time service.

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:41.019
By being active, you showed Jehovah that his kingdom is the most important thing in your life.

00:05:41.019 --> 00:05:47.019
And Jehovah promises to care for those who put his kingdom first.

00:05:47.019 --> 00:05:54.019
You are in his protective hands. There is no need to be anxious or fearful.

00:05:54.019 --> 00:06:02.019
Therefore, being active in the ministry is the first step towards being prepared for tomorrow.

00:06:02.019 --> 00:06:10.129
Next, the Apostle Peter tells us to keep our senses completely.

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:14.129
This means being balanced in our thinking.

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:24.129
Thus, we are able to evaluate matters properly, come to the right conclusions, and make good decisions.

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:27.129
Isn't this what we want?

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:33.129
How can we make good decisions, especially when we face unexpected events in our life?

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:40.600
Developing Christian qualities helps us keep our senses.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:45.600
For instance, Peter mentions one important quality at 2 Peter 2 verse 9.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:52.600
So then, Jehovah knows how to rescue people of godly devotion out of trial.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:59.600
So what quality can help us to keep our senses completely and make good decisions?

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.600
It's godly devotion.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:06.600
This means being loyal to Jehovah and doing what he asks.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:12.600
Is this not what we promised to do when we dedicated our lives to him and got baptized?

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.600
Yes.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:22.600
And since then, we have made many decisions to follow his directions which often come through his organization.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:31.600
Some changes were easy. Others were hard, especially when we did not fully understand the direction or agree with it.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:37.600
Can you think of a time when you made a difficult change for Jehovah?

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:43.600
Did you later see how following his direction led to good results?

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:51.600
Your love for Jehovah and your deep devotion to him helped you to make wise decisions.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.600
What's the point?

00:07:54.600 --> 00:08:04.600
Doing what Jehovah asked us today not only brings good results now, but also prepares us for tomorrow.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:13.600
It ensures that when we are faced with a critical situation, we will naturally follow Jehovah's directions.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.600
Isn't this the best way to prepare for the future?

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:23.600
For example, you may remember Sister Margaret Weirich who had to flee from wildfires.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:29.600
She learned from Jehovah's organization how important it is to obey those directing traffic.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:37.600
Although she wanted to drive a different way, she followed directions and was safe.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:46.600
Her godly devotion was evident. It's what prepared her for the future and ultimately saved her life.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:51.600
So, Peter said we must keep our senses.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:09:05.139
How? By cultivating qualities like godly devotion, this allows us to make good decisions and experience Jehovah's care.

00:09:05.139 --> 00:09:10.139
What was the third point that Peter mentioned at 1 Peter 1 verse 13?

00:09:10.139 --> 00:09:16.139
He tells us to set our hope on the undeserved kindness.

00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:19.139
What was Peter trying to say?

00:09:19.139 --> 00:09:29.139
How can these two elements, hope and undeserved kindness help us to prepare for tomorrow?

00:09:29.139 --> 00:09:35.139
First, we have reminded of the stabilizing effect that hope can have on us.

00:09:35.139 --> 00:09:41.610
It is compared to an anchor that keeps a ship secure during a storm.

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:52.610
When we become anxious about what we might have to endure tomorrow, persecution, disaster or health issues,

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:56.610
don't we feel like we are in a storm?

00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:02.610
Without hope, we might easily lose our balance.

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:13.610
Peter encourages us here to see beyond the uncertainties and focus on what is certain, solid and secure.

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:19.610
Our hope, our view of future blessings stabilizes us.

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:27.860
Did you notice that Peter made a connection between hope and undeserved kindness?

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:36.860
The hope that we have is a gift from Jehovah, and Jesus' resurrection is the basis for our hope.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:43.860
The more we reflect on this, the stronger our gratitude and hope become.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:48.860
This grateful attitude influences our daily life.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:58.860
Also, for example, notice the mindset Peter mentioned at 1 Peter 2, verse 11.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:09.860
Beloved, I urge you as foreigners and temporary residents to keep abstaining from fleshly desires which rage war against you.

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:17.860
Our daily choices show that we do not belong to this world or seek its protection.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:21.860
We are residents of God's kingdom.

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:25.860
Peter reminds us to be different.

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:31.860
For instance, we are different because of our view of material things.

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:42.649
Materialism, a fleshly desire has affected people around us, and many would sacrifice everything for material things.

00:11:42.649 --> 00:11:49.649
For example, many people are overly concerned about their financial future.

00:11:49.649 --> 00:12:08.149
While it's the course of wisdom to do some planning, excessive worry about material needs later in life may cause some to put undue pressure on children and other family members to pursue a secular career.

00:12:08.149 --> 00:12:15.149
This is common in some cultures, and it can affect us if we are not careful.

00:12:15.149 --> 00:12:29.529
We might feel pressured to imitate others, and this could even affect our friendship with Jehovah or what others in our family can do for him.

00:12:29.529 --> 00:12:38.529
In the following interview, notice how parents living in such a culture chose to prepare for the future.

00:12:38.529 --> 00:12:47.870
Hong Kong is an international city, and it is known for having high property prices.

00:12:47.870 --> 00:13:02.870
I was a teacher, and as a teacher, I advise my students to study hard and choose the majors that can help them find a job with a higher income and a stable future.

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:10.870
Before I learned the truth, I also hope that our children could have a better future by getting a good job when they grew up.

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:15.870
That way, they could also support us financially.

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:23.870
Being Christian parents in the truth, we didn't want them to neglect their studies in school, but we also wanted them to know about the Bible.

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:30.870
Therefore, we started studying the Bible with them and took them to meetings and helped them to preach to others.

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:39.600
Since they were young, I emphasized the blessings from God and that we should always give things to him.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:47.600
So when one of my sons told me, Dad, I want a pioneer. I was thrilled, and I said, You should do it.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:55.600
But when I heard that he wanted to pioneer and work part-time, I worried about how that would affect our income.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.600
However, we never had a problem.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.600
I really saw how Jehovah blessed us.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:09.600
The amount of money that we earned was more than enough, and I felt cared for and provided for by Jehovah.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:16.600
When my eldest son told me that he wanted to stop his current studies and start learning a construction trade, I was disappointed.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:23.600
I thought that even students who didn't do well could do that job, and that type of work would be physically harder for him.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:30.600
But he explained to us that being a construction worker would be useful now and forever in the New World.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.600
I eventually respected his decision.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:44.600
We taught our children to put Jehovah first, but when it came to putting it into practice, I needed to respect the decision made by my son.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:52.519
In order to make it possible for our whole family to pioneer, we needed to simplify our lives.

00:14:53.519 --> 00:14:59.519
During family worship, we discussed ways to reduce expenses so that everyone in the family was on the same page.

00:14:59.519 --> 00:15:06.519
I noticed that we did not lack anything, and that the whole family could all share the burden of our expenses.

00:15:06.519 --> 00:15:13.629
Our children are now all grown up, and they willingly serve Jehovah.

00:15:13.629 --> 00:15:20.629
I am so grateful to Jehovah because they have come to love him with their whole hearts.

00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:24.629
We are all so happy.

00:15:24.629 --> 00:15:31.629
I am thankful to Jehovah every time I see the smiling faces of my family.

00:15:31.629 --> 00:15:36.629
I have clearly felt that Jehovah always takes care of his servants.

00:15:36.629 --> 00:15:48.629
Like it says, at Matthew 6.33, if we keep seeking first God's kingdom and His righteousness, Jehovah will take care of us.

00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:56.629
And if our prayers are according to God's will and we try our best, He will undoubtedly bless our efforts.

00:15:56.629 --> 00:16:01.629
Therefore, I have strong faith and hope for our future ahead.

00:16:01.629 --> 00:16:15.480
Being different can be challenging, but wasn't it encouraging to see how this couple resisted cultural expectations and pressure?

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:25.889
Instead, they agreed with their children's desire to pursue goals in Jehovah's service, and they supported them.

00:16:25.889 --> 00:16:31.889
Strengthening our friendship with Jehovah is the best preparation for tomorrow.

00:16:31.889 --> 00:16:41.889
And whether Jehovah ultimately uses children to care for their parents or provides help in another way,

00:16:41.889 --> 00:16:46.889
Jehovah will stick to his promise to care for us.

00:16:46.889 --> 00:16:59.899
To be fully equipped for tomorrow, we set our hope with gratitude on our God, the God we trust.

00:16:59.899 --> 00:17:07.900
In this discussion, did you find that you are already doing these things? Likely so.

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:18.900
Therefore, we do not have any reason to be overly anxious or fearful about future trials or other uncertainties.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:27.900
We face the future with confidence, because we are fully equipped for tomorrow.
