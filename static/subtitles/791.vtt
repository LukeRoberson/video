00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:11.160
In God we trust. It says on U.S. dollar bills. However, according to the actual attitude

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:19.899
of the people, she did not rather say, in money we trust. However, trusting in money or

00:00:19.899 --> 00:00:28.320
riches will lead to disappointment. Proverbs 11, 28 says, one trusting in riches will

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:39.429
fail. As Jehovah's Witnesses, we say, in Jehovah we trust. Therefore, we will not fail. There's

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:47.270
many reasons to trust Jehovah. We are all impressed by Jehovah's works, aren't we? This includes

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:54.429
nature. Aren't we impressed when we look at majestic mountains, when we admire the beauty

00:00:54.429 --> 00:01:04.819
of flowers? There were so many different flowers in the world. Which one do you like best? Man

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:14.340
can make artificial flowers, but not real ones that reproduce. Man can make a beautiful jewelry

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:24.060
or other works of art. However, man cannot produce or make a single stem of grass. Not to speak

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:34.620
of flowers or trees. Should reflection on this not make us humble? Man cannot create any living

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:48.219
thing, but Jehovah can and did. Jesus commanded, or in connection with Matthew 6, 29, and he said

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:54.299
also, in this verse, take a lesson from the lilies of the field, how they grow, they do not

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:00.180
toil, they do not spin, but I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:10.740
as one of these. As Jehovah is the Almighty and he created nature and man. He did not need

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:18.979
to create nature and us in order for him to be happy. He existed before he started to

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:30.419
create for an unknown length of time, as we understand time. Since when does Jehovah exist? He

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:40.419
always existed. How can we understand this? Suppose there was a time when Jehovah did not exist

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:53.139
yet. Then nothing would exist now. Why? Because nothing can come from nothing. The fact that we

00:02:53.139 --> 00:03:02.340
exist is proof that Jehovah always existed is that simple. Before Jehovah started to create,

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.539
he existed all alone, but he did not feel lonely, did he? He does not depend on others

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:17.379
or on things to feel happy. The Bible says, 1 Timothy 110, he is the happy God.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:26.979
Jehovah exists from time indefinite to time indefinite and has complete knowledge of the

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:35.620
universe and history. Psalm 90 verse 1 and 2 says, oh Jehovah, from everlasting to everlasting, you

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:46.419
are God. Jehovah created the universe, the earth and man. He desired to let others share intelligent

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:55.539
life and self-awareness of love. It is not that he needed other creatures to feel happy

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:05.300
or he didn't also need material things to feel happy. He was happy since past eternity before

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:12.900
creation. How loving that he created mankind so that we can enjoy life and friendship with him.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:22.579
And what an expression of his almightyness, his wisdom and love. It impresses on our mind

00:04:22.579 --> 00:04:28.579
and heart how great Jehovah is. When we encounter challenges in our everyday lives,

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:35.860
meditating on Jehovah will help us to endure challenges and difficulties of all sorts

00:04:36.579 --> 00:04:46.500
and to trust him. You soon to be gladuates will find this to be true when you are confronted

00:04:46.579 --> 00:04:55.300
with problems in the future. If you experience problems, then what? Pray to Jehovah. His

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:04.740
ability to hear prayers is mind-boggling. Is it not so that when we pray, we have the feeling

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:11.779
that Jehovah at that moment has nothing else in mind or to do than just listen to us.

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:25.060
But he can listen to tens of thousands of prayers in hundreds of languages all at the same time.

00:05:26.579 --> 00:05:32.819
This includes prayers which are not presented audibly, but silent prayers also spoken

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:43.779
in our heart and our mind. How awesome. This really strengthens our trust and faith in him,

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:53.379
doesn't it? The universe also that Jehovah created strengthens our trust in him.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:00.100
We feel really small and insignificant when we think that the universe got started about

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:11.300
as scientists say 18 to 20 billion years ago. Let us consider a few facts or

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:20.100
from the connection with the universe that expands, comments that were made about galaxies that

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:29.699
move into empty space, empty space where no galaxies or stars yet, even with the newest telescope,

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:37.540
scientists have not reached the border of the physical universe behind which there is nothing,

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:45.620
just empty space. It is mind-boggling to meditate on the universe. Looking at the starry heaven at

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:53.740
night, have you ever wondered how far out into space you are actually peering or how many stars you

00:06:53.740 --> 00:07:02.540
can see with your naked eye? In Psalm 8, verse 3 and 4, David wrote about looking at the stars,

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:08.220
he said, when I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:14.540
prepared, what is mortal man that you keep in mind and the son of man that you take care of him?

00:07:15.339 --> 00:07:24.779
It really can make us feel humble to meditate on the universe. How far into the universe could

00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:37.019
David and also we peer? A distance of some 600,000 light years according to a watchtower in 1983.

00:07:37.899 --> 00:07:45.819
It is estimated that our Milky Way alone contains 200 to 400 billion stars.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:54.779
The stars move with fantastic speed. The Encyclopedia says, quote, the speed of our solar system

00:07:54.779 --> 00:08:05.660
circulating in our galaxies is about 220 kilometers per second. And as scientists found out at the speed

00:08:06.139 --> 00:08:19.339
of 568,000 miles per hour, end of quote, it is estimated that a light beam takes about 100,000

00:08:19.339 --> 00:08:28.939
years from one end of our Milky Way to the other end. If we look at our Milky Way from outside,

00:08:29.819 --> 00:08:39.659
our Milky Way and from a different angle, we would see it like a disk. But we see it as a way

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:45.179
due to the location of our solar system and the outskirts of the Milky Way.

00:08:47.019 --> 00:08:56.139
In the book Guide to the Galaxy published in 1994, it says that it takes the solar system

00:08:56.139 --> 00:09:08.059
240 million years to complete the grand circuit around the galaxy. This speed is an absolute speed

00:09:09.019 --> 00:09:18.940
end of quote. Astronomers estimated that there are approximately 100 billion to one trillion

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:28.139
galaxies in the universe. But how many stars? It is estimated between 10,

00:09:28.139 --> 00:09:37.980
60,000 and 1,000,000 if it means something to you. You may wonder what is 1,000,000,000? Well,

00:09:38.539 --> 00:09:53.820
it is, as we can see, illustrated one with 24 zeros. That is, if you take 1 billion and you multiply

00:09:53.820 --> 00:10:02.620
that by one quadrillion next to picture shows, you get 1.7 billion. Can you follow? It's hard for me.

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:13.100
The Watchtower of March 1, 1991 raised the question, quote, where is the source of all the energy

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:22.139
represented by the 100,000 million stars in our galaxy, and it's just one galaxy, as well as

00:10:22.139 --> 00:10:31.179
the more than 1,000 million galaxies that make up the visible universe? To quote from 1991,

00:10:31.179 --> 00:10:40.539
Watchtower March 1. The Bible encourages us to meditate on the universe. It strengthens our trust

00:10:41.179 --> 00:10:50.940
into hover. The Bible says, raise your eyes high up and see, who has created these things? It's the

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:56.700
one who is bringing forth the army of them even by number, all of whom he calls even by name.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:04.139
Due to the abundance of dynamic energy, he also being vigorous in power, not one of them is missing.

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:13.500
Well, who is that one? Of course, Jehovah. Why is it good to talk about the universe

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:22.620
since it is so hard to fathom its size? The universe proves that Jehovah is all mighty,

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:31.259
and this inspires us to trust in his prophecies about putting an end to wickedness,

00:11:31.259 --> 00:11:37.340
putting an end to the devil, and creating a paradise on earth for all obedient mankind.

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:45.820
It's good to reflect on what David wrote about Jehovah in Psalm 139.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:54.940
In verses 1 to 5, David is confident of Jehovah's interest in him.

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:07.179
Jehovah wants but to hear from us. We can share our innermost thoughts. We can tell Jehovah anything

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:19.120
without being embarrassed. So let's look at the scripture, Psalm 139.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.480
From verse 1.

00:12:24.639 --> 00:12:31.679
You have searched through me and you know me. You know when I sit down and when I rise up,

00:12:31.679 --> 00:12:38.799
you discern my thoughts from afar. You observe me when I travel and when I lay down.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:46.080
You are familiar with all my ways. There's not a word on my tongue but look, Jehovah, you already know

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:57.580
it well. Behind and before me, you surround me and you lay your hand upon me. So that's a very

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:07.019
impressive text, isn't it? In verses 6 to 13, David tried to comprehend Jehovah's greatness.

00:13:07.019 --> 00:13:15.710
It was too much for him. And so in verse 6, he goes on to say, such knowledge is beyond my

00:13:15.789 --> 00:13:23.389
comprehension. It is too high for me to reach. Where can I escape from your spirit and where can I

00:13:23.389 --> 00:13:29.870
run away from your face? If I were to ascend to heaven, you would be there. And if I were to

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:38.909
make my bed in the grave, look, you would be there. If I would fly away with the wings of the dawn

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:46.269
to reside by the most remote sea, even there your hand would lead me and your right hand would

00:13:46.269 --> 00:13:52.909
take hold of me. If I say, surely darkness will conceal me, then the night around me would become

00:13:52.909 --> 00:13:59.470
light. Even the darkness would not be too dark for you. But night would be as bright as the day.

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:08.830
Darkness is the same as light for you. For you produced my kidneys, you kept me screened off

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:18.190
in my mother's womb. David is amazed that Jehovah's wisdom in creating a human body. He gives

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:27.789
all credit to Jehovah for his extraordinary gift. Verse 14 continues to say, I praise you

00:14:28.669 --> 00:14:35.789
because in an awe-inspiring way, I'm wonderfully made. Your works are wonderful and I know this

00:14:35.789 --> 00:14:44.509
very well. My bones were not hidden from you when I was made in secret, when I was woven in the

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:52.110
depth of the earth, figuratively. Your eyes even saw me as an embryo. All its parts were written

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:57.389
in your book regarding the days when they were formed before any of them existed.

00:14:58.269 --> 00:15:08.029
So let's read two more verses and see the effect it had on David and his complete trust and

00:15:08.029 --> 00:15:16.990
confidence in his Heavenly Father. Verse 17. So to me, how precious your thoughts are, oh God,

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:26.590
how vast is the sum of them? If I try to count them, they outnumber the grains of sand.

00:15:27.389 --> 00:15:38.509
When I awake, I'm still with you. So we agree with David that we are created in a wonderful way,

00:15:38.509 --> 00:15:48.990
very impressive. Well, think of as an example of our ability to use language and thought.

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:54.909
We are also unique in our profound curiosity about ourselves, aren't we?

00:15:55.710 --> 00:16:01.389
Different from all animals, we are unique in our ability to contemplate God's thoughts.

00:16:02.669 --> 00:16:12.509
This is one way we are made in God's image. Think of our eyes, a marvel, we have binocular vision,

00:16:13.549 --> 00:16:21.070
able to distinguish the relationship between different objects. Think of our ears, a marvel,

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:27.789
we hear in stereo. Now let's talk about the universe in our brain.

00:16:30.559 --> 00:16:38.159
The book The Physics Fact Book edited by Glenn Ellert says in the quote, weighing around three

00:16:38.159 --> 00:16:48.960
pounds, the brain contains nearly 100 billion neurons. What's that? Neuf cells.

00:16:49.279 --> 00:16:56.240
100 billion neurons. If you don't believe me, you can verify count yourself here.

00:17:00.259 --> 00:17:07.779
The brain is the most complicated organ in the universe. One reference works as about these

00:17:07.779 --> 00:17:17.619
nerve cells that they are as many as the stars in the Milky Way galaxy. It also has trillions

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:29.619
of supportive cells called glia. Each neuron is connected to other neurons by as many as 40,000

00:17:29.619 --> 00:17:39.779
individual connections called synopsis between the cells. The brain has more connections than

00:17:40.339 --> 00:17:49.940
our stars in the universe. End of quote. No question. We are wonderfully made and all the praise

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:58.339
belongs to Jehovah. Being aware that Jehovah created this fantastic universe, the earth and man,

00:17:58.339 --> 00:18:06.420
does this not help us to become more confident in our trust in Jehovah to be able and willing to

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:16.099
help us when we face problems or challenges. Should we face persecution or abandon on our work

00:18:16.099 --> 00:18:26.500
then what? Trust in Jehovah. But Jehovah is not only all-powerful. He is also love,

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:33.460
personified. Jehovah is very interested in you soon to be glial graduates. Yes, he's interested

00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:40.980
in all of us. He loves us. He gave his beloved son Jesus Christ as a sacrifice for our sins and

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:47.140
for the purpose of helping us to become perfect and enjoy everlasting friendship with him.

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:56.740
Jehovah had full trust and confidence in his son's faithfulness. His love moves us to love.

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:05.940
Love is the perfect bond of unions as Colossians 3, 4 team. Yes, it is the most powerful bond in

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:15.059
the universe. Perfect love bonding the son and the father together unbreakably. For like

00:19:15.059 --> 00:19:21.539
reasons God trusts his organization of servants, knowing that love would hold most of them

00:19:21.539 --> 00:19:33.779
immovably under test. Psalm 56 verse 11 says, in God we have put our trust. Psalm 3 verse 5 encourages

00:19:33.779 --> 00:19:42.500
us. Trust in Jehovah with all your heart. Jesus is our best example. When he was nailed to the

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:49.940
torture stake his enemies mockingly said, he has put his trust in God. Let him now rescue him if

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:58.529
he wants him for he said, I'm God's son. On the other hand Jehovah trusts us as well.

00:20:00.369 --> 00:20:07.730
How encouraging. He trusts his organization of servants knowing that love would hold most of them

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:18.369
or most of us immovably to him. Immovably under test and that his organization of

00:20:19.329 --> 00:20:28.450
creatures would never stop doing so. He trusted Abraham. He trusted other patriarchs.

00:20:29.329 --> 00:20:36.529
He trusts the anointed ones today. He trusts the members of the great crowd with an earthly hope.

00:20:37.569 --> 00:20:48.289
Yes, Jehovah trusts you and we trust that you all will continue to trust Jehovah forever.

00:20:48.369 --> 00:20:58.289
Yes, in God we trust.
