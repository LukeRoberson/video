00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:09.009
Welcome to JW Broadcasting. What's in store for us this month? If you've ever

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:13.810
struggled with feelings of inadequacy, you'll relate to the experiences of

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:19.850
Francis, Diego and Carla. They'll tell us how they came to appreciate their

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:26.449
valuable place in Jehovah's congregation. When tragedy strikes, it's easy to

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.210
feel overwhelmed. We'll learn how a brother who struggled to care for his family

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:38.649
spirituality got the help he needed to regain his balance and his joy. And in our

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:43.170
new music video, we'll see how learning the truth brings true comfort to those

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:51.250
who draw close to Jehovah and his people. This is JW Broadcasting for May 2023.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:01:15.680
As Jehovah's servants, nothing brings us greater joy than worshiping the true

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:23.400
God. But we are also human. This means that from time to time, any of us can

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.959
and probably will experience unsettling moments. Times when we question our

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:36.519
worth. For example, have you ever wondered about your true value in Jehovah's

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:42.959
eyes? Have you ever experienced moments of anxiety about your place in his

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:50.719
organization? Or have you struggled with feelings of worthlessness? Such thoughts

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:56.439
can erode our joy. And we might even begin to doubt our personal worth to

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:03.959
Jehovah. If that has happened to you, you're not alone. Centuries ago, the

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:10.879
writer of Psalm 94 revealed that he too was overwhelmed by anxieties. Let's

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:20.210
read it together at Psalm 94 and verse 19. The writer is addressing Jehovah. When

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.889
anxieties overwhelmed me, you comforted and soothed me. Now notice the footnote

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:34.370
on verse 19, disquieting thoughts. These can arise from factors such as guilt

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:41.129
over the fact that we cannot do more in the ministry or in the congregation. Fear

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:46.849
of the future of being separated from the ones we know and love and despair

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:52.129
from being overlooked, feeling that we don't really matter. Disquieting

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:58.530
thoughts are real and can overwhelm us at times. They can rob us of our inner

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.449
peace and our sleep. And if we're not careful, they can even stifle our prayers,

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:12.129
damaging our relationship with Jehovah. Nothing would make Satan happier. We never

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:18.449
want that to happen, especially now, since this old world is so near to closing.

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:25.050
So what can help us to soothe these disquieting thoughts? In this month's

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:31.169
broadcast, we will find the answer in a heartwarming prophecy. We hope that

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:37.090
this inspired message will provide a strong scriptural basis to help you to

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:43.449
dispel any feelings of inadequacy. Which prophecy? Well, please open your Bible

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:49.689
to Isaiah chapter 56. Here we read of one of the most touching expressions of

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:55.490
Jehovah's appreciation for two groups of people. Both groups wanted to serve

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:01.490
Jehovah, but under the Mosaic law, they were limited or even disqualified from

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:07.330
fully participating in Jehovah's arrangement for pure worship. Who were they?

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:16.649
Let's read Isaiah chapter 56, verse 3. The foreigner who joins himself to

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:22.930
Jehovah should not say, Jehovah will surely separate me from his people. And the

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:30.089
eunuch should not say, Look, I'm a dried up tree. Did you notice the two groups,

00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:36.889
foreigners or non-Israelites and eunuchs, men who physically could not produce

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:43.889
children? They faced very difficult and possibly disheartening circumstances.

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:49.009
During Isaiah's time, uncircumcised foreigners were allowed to live in

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:54.569
Israel, but they had no permanent ties with the nation. Because of their

00:04:54.569 --> 00:05:00.329
status, they could not eat of the Passover meal. And as a protection, the

00:05:00.329 --> 00:05:06.449
Israelites were not to associate closely with them. But many foreigners came to

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:12.170
love Jehovah, converted to pure worship, and served Jehovah alongside his

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:20.009
people. They were called proselytes. Nevertheless, even they could not fully

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:25.930
become part of the nation of Israel. How would you feel if you were a foreigner

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:32.449
alive at that time? Your biggest fear would be getting cut off from God's people.

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:39.370
Might you have disquieting thoughts at times? Consider the second group. Isaiah

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:46.170
mentioned eunuchs. These were men who had their reproductive organs removed. It

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:51.329
was the custom of Eastern pagan nations to make eunuchs out of some of the male

00:05:51.329 --> 00:05:56.050
children, taken captive in war, and then assigned them to serve as trusted

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:02.610
officials in royal courts or in other settings. It appears that during the days of

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:08.490
Isaiah, some of these Gentile eunuchs learned about Jehovah, came to love him and

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:15.319
decided to align themselves with Jehovah's people. These eunuchs enjoyed a

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:19.519
measure of acceptance among Jehovah's people, and they had the privilege of

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:25.560
worshipping Jehovah. However, because they were eunuchs, they could not become

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:32.720
fully-fledged members of the congregation of Israel. Plus, at that time and in

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.720
that culture, they suffered great humiliation and not being able to father

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:44.920
children. Do you think they experienced disquieting thoughts at times? We know

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:52.480
they did. But Isaiah reveals something significant about this group. Jehovah loved

00:06:52.480 --> 00:07:00.160
them. In effect, Jehovah says to them, I know how you feel. Now let me tell you

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:11.500
how I feel about you. Let's read Isaiah chapter 56, verses 4 and 5. For this is

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:16.100
what Jehovah says to the eunuchs, who keep my sabbaths and who choose what I

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:22.339
delight in and who hold fast to my covenant. I will give to them in my house and

00:07:22.339 --> 00:07:28.420
within my walls a monument and a name, something better than sons and daughters.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:35.699
In everlasting name, I will give them one that will not perish. I will give them

00:07:35.699 --> 00:07:42.139
something better than sons and daughters. In everlasting name, their physical

00:07:42.139 --> 00:07:48.779
limitations did not diminish their value in the eyes of our loving God because of

00:07:48.779 --> 00:07:55.019
their whole soul obedience to Him. Jehovah would always remember them. They would

00:07:55.019 --> 00:08:01.620
have an everlasting name, one that would not perish. Jehovah treasured these

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:06.420
faithful ones so much that he kept the memory of their service in his house

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:14.740
within his walls like a monument so as to cherish them daily. Imagine how those

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:20.459
eunuchs felt now knowing that their God had something special reserved for them.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:25.100
They knew Jehovah had heard their prayers. They knew that their God felt

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:31.779
compassion for them. All those desquieting thoughts started to melt away. Those

00:08:31.779 --> 00:08:37.860
comforting words started to heal their broken spirit. But why did Jehovah make

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:45.340
these promises to these two groups? What did he see that others may not have? We

00:08:45.379 --> 00:08:51.220
don't have all the details, but we do have some. They are revealed to us much

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:58.419
later in time. And they give us valuable clues. For example, in the book of

00:08:58.419 --> 00:09:04.419
Nehemiah, we are introduced to two foreigners who are living among God's people.

00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:11.340
There's a significant detail about their names. Nehemiah chapter 3 and verse

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:19.700
7 tells us they were Melataya, the Ghibinite, and Jaden, the Moranithite, who were

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:27.059
of foreign descent. Yet their names tell a different story. What do they mean?

00:09:27.059 --> 00:09:36.460
Melataya means Jaha has provided escape. Jaden means Jehovah has given ear. How

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:42.419
did they get those names? These men were likely born in Babylon, children of

00:09:42.419 --> 00:09:48.220
foreigners who joined in true worship in Israel and who were later taken captive

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:56.940
in 607 BCE. The parents of these men were not natural Israelites. However, the

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:02.179
names they chose for their children reflected their devotion and love for

00:10:02.179 --> 00:10:09.019
Jaha'uva's name. And the fact that these sons of non-Israelites would want to

00:10:09.019 --> 00:10:16.620
share and rebuilding Jerusalem shows how they themselves love Jaha'uva. How did

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:22.940
Jaha'uva feel about these foreigners? Notice his prophetic words as we continue

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:31.629
on at Isaiah chapter 56 verse 6 and 7. As for the foreigners who join themselves to

00:10:31.629 --> 00:10:36.669
Jaha'uva, to minister to him, to love the name of Jaha'uva and to be his

00:10:36.669 --> 00:10:42.389
servants, all those who keep the Sabbath and do not profane it and who hold fast

00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:47.950
to my covenant. I will also bring them to my holy mountain and make them rejoice

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:53.549
inside my house of prayer. Their whole burnt offerings and their sacrifices will

00:10:53.549 --> 00:10:59.070
be accepted on my altar from my house will be called a house of prayer for all

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:05.190
the peoples. Jaha'uva noticed that these foreigners faithfully observed the

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:10.590
laws of a covenant that they could never be fully a part of. In verses 6 and

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:17.429
7, Jaha'uva was in effect inviting them into his home, a house of prayer for

00:11:17.429 --> 00:11:23.710
all the peoples, Jew and foreigner alike. Hearing these words must have lifted

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:28.509
their heavy hearts, but Jaha'uva did more than just tell them how much he

00:11:28.509 --> 00:11:35.710
valued them, he showed them. How? Among the foreigners who returned to the

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:41.789
ruins of Jerusalem in 537 BCE were particular group of foreigners who had

00:11:41.789 --> 00:11:48.149
become proselytes, and they included descendants of the Ghiblianites, a nation

00:11:48.149 --> 00:11:53.389
that had joined themselves to Israel and served as gathers of wood and draws of

00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:59.429
water for the assembly and for Jaha'uva's altar. These descendants of the

00:11:59.429 --> 00:12:04.669
Ghiblianites had spent decades as captives in Babylon for crimes they did not

00:12:04.669 --> 00:12:11.230
commit. They had no land inheritance back in Israel. They were servants. Yet

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:15.629
they traveled back to Israel and helped rebuild the temple and the walls of

00:12:15.629 --> 00:12:23.230
Jerusalem. What motivated them? They loved Jaha'uva. These descendants of

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:28.870
Ghiblian expected nothing in return for their service, but they did receive

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:34.309
something quite unexpected. After the Israelites received their portion land,

00:12:34.309 --> 00:12:40.110
this group called the Nethanem, who did not have a land inheritance, were

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:45.750
assigned a place to live. Where would they be placed? Outside the city, in a

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:52.389
slum, in some abandoned part of forgotten Jerusalem? No, the Bible tells us they

00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:58.190
were assigned to live in Ophol. Now take a look at the map and see for yourself

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:05.389
where Ophol is located right next to the temple. Jaha'uva made these humble

00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:10.549
gathers of wood his neighbors. This underscores how much Jaha'uva loved and

00:13:10.549 --> 00:13:15.909
cherished these faithful foreigners who motivated by love that all they could

00:13:15.909 --> 00:13:22.509
to share in his worship. What's the lesson? Both the Unix and the foreigners

00:13:22.509 --> 00:13:27.990
were limited and what they could do in God's service. From a human standpoint,

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:34.750
they were probably considered less than ordinary. Nothing special. Perhaps some

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:41.950
even considered them outcasts. That is not how Jaha'uva viewed them. He knew each

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:48.190
one by name. He listened to their prayers, and he viewed each individual as a

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:55.629
precious gem. Where man sees the ordinary, our Heavenly Father sees the extra

00:13:55.629 --> 00:14:03.269
ordinary. To illustrate, what do you see here? If you are thinking sand, you are

00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:09.429
right. Sand is one of the most common substances on the earth. To us, it

00:14:09.429 --> 00:14:16.149
typically looks bland in an ordinary. Each particle identical to the next. No

00:14:16.149 --> 00:14:21.590
color, no sparkle, you never see someone show off a sand necklace or bracelet.

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:29.629
But what happens if you look at sand under the microscope? To the naked eye, all

00:14:29.629 --> 00:14:36.309
sand looks the same and is pretty dull. But magnified a hundredfold or more, each

00:14:36.309 --> 00:14:42.070
individual grain of sand reveals distinct beauty. We see parts of shells and

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:47.990
crystals, all contrasting in shapes and colors. There is a treasure trove and

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:56.629
a handful of sand. That is how Jaha'uva sees each of you. Just as he saw the

00:14:56.629 --> 00:15:02.870
faithful foreigners in Unix, for the precious gems that they were, he sees you too.

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:10.789
Yes, you who may be restricted by age, health, physical stamina, emotions, or

00:15:10.789 --> 00:15:15.590
family responsibilities from doing as much in some spiritual activities as you

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:23.549
would like to. But those limitations do not define you. Remember that in God's

00:15:23.549 --> 00:15:29.750
eyes, your worth as a person is not measured by how much you do, but rather

00:15:30.149 --> 00:15:38.309
how much you try. With eternity and perfection in view, Jaha'uva chooses to see not your

00:15:38.309 --> 00:15:46.309
limitations, but your potential. When you serve Jaha'uva, wholesome, despite limited

00:15:46.309 --> 00:15:53.909
circumstances, you sparkle in his eyes. And because you shine so brightly in Jaha'uva's heart,

00:15:54.629 --> 00:15:58.230
he will always help you. He will always cherish you.

00:15:59.509 --> 00:16:03.590
Do you remember the faithful Psalmist who wrote about being overwhelmed by

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:11.350
disquiring thoughts at Psalm 94 and 19? In the very next line, he tells Jaha'uva,

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:19.110
you comforted and soothed me. By the way, who wrote that song? We don't know his name,

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:26.629
but Jaha'uva does, and he carefully preserved that unknown writer's words for thousands of

00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:34.309
years in the Bible. Like the Psalmist, the Farner, the Unig, no matter the circumstances,

00:16:34.309 --> 00:16:40.309
when you humbly served Jaha'uva, when you try your best, your work is never frueless.

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:47.830
In everlasting name is reserved for each of you, because your Heavenly Father cherishes you.

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:56.970
Even though we know Jaha'uva loves us, at times we may wonder where we personally fit in the

00:16:56.970 --> 00:17:05.130
congregation, especially if we can't do as much as we used to. In this video, note how three

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:11.849
regular pioneers came to appreciate their cherished place in Jaha'uva's family, despite

00:17:11.849 --> 00:17:32.789
major changes in their lives. Shortly after getting baptized, I set the goal of becoming a regular

00:17:32.789 --> 00:17:42.279
pioneer. Then I went to preach an unassigned territory where mosquito is spoken. After that,

00:17:42.279 --> 00:17:48.259
I started serving as a special pioneer, and sometime later I went to the school for

00:17:48.259 --> 00:17:56.259
kingdom evangelizers. Sometime ago, I began to suffer from kidney failure, so it felt like I

00:17:56.259 --> 00:18:04.900
wasn't doing anything anymore, and I couldn't go back in time. I grew up in a Christian family.

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:10.579
My dad worked in the construction of the Bethel branch, and then served as a Bethel I for some time.

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:18.019
My mom was a regular pioneer when she was younger. She also volunteered at Bethel,

00:18:20.089 --> 00:18:26.650
and that's how she met my dad. Some years ago, I started suffering from severe anxiety attacks,

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:33.849
and that really affected me in the congregation. I started to compare myself to others,

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:39.690
and I did the same with my parents. I felt I could never live up to their example.

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:49.670
I grew up in a family where I wasn't made to feel. I never really felt adequate.

00:18:51.269 --> 00:18:58.460
I felt so worthless. I felt very alone. When my health problems began,

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:06.500
I started comparing myself. I began thinking about what I was able to do before,

00:19:06.819 --> 00:19:15.220
and about how my activity had gone down. This watched our study help me to see how some previous

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:23.769
assignments would help me to do things better in my current assignment. That helped me to think

00:19:23.769 --> 00:19:30.089
about what I can do now. I think this watched our article came just at the right time.

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:38.710
I've learned that comparing myself to others is very damaging, and it was bringing me down

00:19:38.789 --> 00:19:45.430
spiritually. So now that I've set the goal to stop doing that, I've seen good results.

00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:51.269
I've had the chance to make good friends with older brothers and sisters in the congregation,

00:19:54.099 --> 00:19:56.339
and when some of them needed help and turned to me,

00:19:58.019 --> 00:20:01.940
I was happy to help them, and that encouraged me a lot.

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:10.740
When I started going to the meetings, I was somewhat afraid. I was going to be an adequate

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:21.750
to the congregation. Paragraph 20 of this watchtower study helps me understand that I should

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:28.390
use the gifts that the congregation, and especially Jehovah, help me to discover,

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:39.420
to encourage the congregation. For example, having raised two children alone as a young single mother,

00:20:41.339 --> 00:20:46.220
being able to do that, I could help others in the congregation who are going through

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:52.779
the same experience. I've set concrete goals for myself, like helping to clean the kingdom hall.

00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:02.920
Although it's lighter work, it's helped me tremendously. It gives me a lot of joy to know that

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:12.119
it's for Jehovah. Now I try to help out the congregation wherever I can. Speaking to an audience

00:21:12.119 --> 00:21:19.500
might not be easy for me, but Jehovah has helped me to carry out my assignments.

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:24.460
And that has helped me to realize my place in Jehovah's congregation.

00:21:26.839 --> 00:21:34.920
This has helped a lot in developing myself a steam, not to dwell on the past, on the old feelings

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:43.799
of inadequacy or dwell on the perfection that I used to demand from myself. I discovered I have

00:21:43.799 --> 00:21:50.119
something good to give to the congregation. The brothers need the good deeds that we're able to do.

00:21:53.109 --> 00:21:57.430
It gives me a lot of joy to see that I can help others overcome their trials.

00:22:00.839 --> 00:22:05.160
Then this really helps me understand that I do have a role in the congregation.

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:27.660
Did you see how Francis, Diego, and Carla maintain their joy? They prayerfully adjusted their

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:35.420
viewpoint and their spiritual routine. Their stories remind us that sometimes our circumstances

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:43.500
change unexpectedly, throwing us off balance. Has that ever happened to you? If so, pay close

00:22:43.500 --> 00:23:08.329
attention to this next dramatization. Carrying for the needs of my family is a source of great joy.

00:23:16.839 --> 00:23:31.000
That was the life that was. One drunk driver and my wife was gone. Our two children had lost

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:42.009
their loving mother. The doctors were hopeful that my son might regain the use of his legs.

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:49.289
But in the meantime, we needed to adjust to this new situation.

00:23:51.130 --> 00:24:02.059
My mum was such a support both emotionally and practically. She helped with the children

00:24:02.779 --> 00:24:09.019
whilst I went to work. That way, I was able to care for the family's physical needs.

00:24:14.069 --> 00:24:21.140
It wasn't easy. I don't know what I would have done without her.

00:24:27.779 --> 00:24:34.579
My fellow elders were loving and considerate too. They offered to lighten some of my congregation

00:24:34.579 --> 00:24:43.829
responsibilities. But I just wanted to keep busy. I tried to keep on top of everything.

00:24:45.029 --> 00:24:52.869
But spiritually, things began to slip. On more than one occasion, I had to ask others to cover

00:24:52.869 --> 00:25:00.950
my meeting parts. Hello. Hi Simon. Hi Oliver. I'm so sorry. I've been held up at work again.

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:07.210
Could you cover the treasure's item for me tonight? I'll see what I can do. Thank you.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:20.819
I was just too tired to prepare for family worship. And the results were obvious.

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:43.589
Everything seemed overwhelming. Even the simple things were a struggle.

00:25:48.170 --> 00:26:03.619
The meeting was great. But that you missed Madison's demonstration tonight. I'm so sorry.

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:18.700
I had to work late. Something had to give. Maybe I needed to step aside as an elder.

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:30.859
I needed help. So I reached out to a good friend, Simon. I explained everything. He really listened.

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:37.660
He empathised and commended me for my efforts. Then shared Philippians 1, 10 with me.

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:41.660
That you may make sure of the more important things.

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:50.700
Oliver, it's especially during challenging times that we need to make sure of the important things.

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:56.900
And the key to doing that is balance. Come over here.

00:26:57.859 --> 00:27:03.700
Simon used a simple illustration that changed my perspective.

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:12.660
Just as a wheel can be out of balance, a sudden change in our circumstances can put us out of balance.

00:27:14.579 --> 00:27:19.380
But skilled mechanics can use small weights to rebalance the wheel.

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:25.619
The machine told Simon where to position the small weights so that the wheel could run smoothly again.

00:27:26.579 --> 00:27:31.539
I got the point. Regaining balance might not involve big changes.

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:44.099
Just a few smaller ones. I understand. Balance comes when we exercise faith.

00:27:47.369 --> 00:27:53.369
Hebrews 11.6 reminded me that Jehovah is the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him.

00:27:54.809 --> 00:27:59.529
And James 3.17 says, the wisdom from above is reasonable.

00:27:59.609 --> 00:28:05.289
I realise that my family's spiritual needs are one of the more important things.

00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:22.019
And it's okay to ask others for support. Applying these Bible principles helped me regain my joy.

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:30.390
Our circumstances may change, but our Christian priorities do not.

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:40.279
They keep us anchored to our living hope. Thanks to Jehovah.

00:28:41.079 --> 00:28:45.880
I was able to provide for my own in the most important ways.

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:54.940
What helped Oliver deal with such overwhelming changes?

00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:58.940
The loving help he got from his brothers and sisters.

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:05.180
The support we get from others can comfort and soothe us just like the Psalmist said,

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:09.900
especially when the world around us makes us feel unwanted.

00:29:10.619 --> 00:29:17.019
That's been the case with some of our brothers and sisters in Africa who deal with a condition

00:29:17.019 --> 00:29:25.339
known as albinism. As you hear their stories, notice how they came to feel not just accepted,

00:29:25.339 --> 00:29:27.660
but cherished in Jehovah's eyes.

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:38.630
Well, my years in school were not easy. Some who tease me, others who laugh at me,

00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:41.430
and still others who use hurtful words to me.

00:29:49.829 --> 00:29:54.069
The best you can do is to get rid of this child, just throw her away.

00:29:54.069 --> 00:29:56.470
That is what my father was told by his friend.

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:03.559
Prejudice against people with albinism can be very cruel.

00:30:04.359 --> 00:30:07.160
Those who are targeted can be traumatised for life.

00:30:08.119 --> 00:30:14.519
Albinism is a genetic disorder in which one's eyes, skin or hair have little or no pigmentation.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:18.119
People with this condition struggle with vision problems.

00:30:18.759 --> 00:30:23.079
Extreme sensitivity to sunlight also puts them at a high risk for skin cancer.

00:30:24.279 --> 00:30:29.720
Beyond the physical challenges, they also have to deal with unwarranted social stigmas.

00:30:31.079 --> 00:30:36.279
In some African countries, people with albinism are even attacked or killed by those involved

00:30:36.279 --> 00:30:40.839
in its periodic rituals. This leads them to live in isolation.

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:44.440
The sealer used to cry often and feel down.

00:30:45.559 --> 00:30:49.640
But since she has learned the truth in the Bible, she has found comfort.

00:30:50.839 --> 00:30:57.000
What helped me to enjoy all these trials was praying to Jehovah regularly and reading his

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:03.799
word to the Bible. The first scripture that touches me deeply is Psalm 18 verse 25.

00:31:04.759 --> 00:31:11.079
This scripture touches my heart to know that if I continue being loyal and righteous,

00:31:11.079 --> 00:31:15.400
Jehovah cannot forget, he will also act in loyalty toward me.

00:31:16.119 --> 00:31:21.799
James was the target of intense ridicule. He isolated himself and felt worthless.

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:27.940
The scripture I loved the most is John chapter 17 and verse 3.

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:36.740
When I read this scripture, I was very happy because I realized that Jehovah values me

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:42.980
or is concerned about me. So this showed me that Jehovah loves me.

00:31:44.339 --> 00:31:49.859
Judith has now spent 24 years in the full-time ministry. As a young girl,

00:31:49.859 --> 00:31:55.460
she was the target of vicious ridicule. She felt insecure and kept to herself.

00:31:55.779 --> 00:32:00.900
Revelation 21, 3 and 4. When I read this scripture,

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:10.579
my faith is strengthened. I feel very happy. It's only through diligent, daily Bible reading and

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:15.779
attending the meetings with our brothers, going out in the ministry.

00:32:17.539 --> 00:32:20.180
This makes me strong and fortifies my faith.

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:26.579
Jehovah's people love and accept those who suffer from various conditions, including

00:32:26.579 --> 00:32:34.819
albinism. Tassila, James and Judith are among those who have experienced that brotherly love

00:32:34.819 --> 00:32:40.660
and acceptance in Jehovah's organization. There is a big difference between how people of the

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:52.140
world and brothers view me. The love they have shown me has helped me prove that really,

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:58.779
this is a spiritual family. When I am among my brothers and sisters,

00:32:58.779 --> 00:33:02.539
I do not see any difference or think that I have different skin.

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:08.700
But I feel loved and happy. I do not lack anything.

00:33:15.289 --> 00:33:20.970
This is my spiritual family. Whenever I am among brothers and sisters,

00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:29.930
I feel happy and protected because I have shown me true love.

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:37.930
Tassila serves as a zealous, regular pioneer. She has overcome illiteracy and now knows how to

00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:43.930
cope with hostility and prejudice. Despite all the negative things she faced in the past,

00:33:44.809 --> 00:33:51.130
she is now positive and cheerful and has her life and hope firmly based on Jehovah's promises.

00:33:52.089 --> 00:33:55.289
James still has to deal with prejudice people from time to time.

00:33:56.329 --> 00:34:03.130
But he does not allow that to make him bitter. Rather, he chooses to respond in a kind manner.

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:12.010
Judith has experienced many disappointment in life. But above all, she cherishes being one of

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:18.489
Jehovah's people. This overwhelming, impartial love shown by fellow brothers and sisters in

00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:23.610
the congregations is a source of support and help not only for individuals with albinism,

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:28.650
but for anyone who struggles with the challenging physical condition or disability.

00:34:29.769 --> 00:34:36.730
Yes, mere man sees what appears to the eyes, but Jehovah sees into the heart.

00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:44.940
mere man sees what appears to the eyes, but Jehovah sees into the heart.

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:49.739
Those are the words found at 1 Samuel chapter 16 and verse 7.

00:34:50.619 --> 00:34:53.980
And it was one of the verses we saw on the chalkboard in the video.

00:34:55.179 --> 00:35:02.539
Jehovah certainly saw into the hearts of James, Tassila, and Judith, and reassured them of his

00:35:02.539 --> 00:35:09.820
love through the congregation. Jehovah will comfort us if we draw close to him and our brothers.

00:35:10.699 --> 00:35:17.019
That's the topic of this month's new music video. It's called draw close to me.

00:35:17.659 --> 00:35:18.940
Please watch and enjoy.

00:35:55.719 --> 00:35:57.719
Oh,

00:35:57.719 --> 00:36:01.239
and he brings comfort to my life.

00:36:03.639 --> 00:36:08.730
Makes me feel that I belong.

00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:29.130
He says draw close to me close and I'll draw close to you.

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:31.929
How help you see.

00:36:32.889 --> 00:37:16.840
Hey, good that I see if you draw close to me.

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:22.090
It's so hard to let it go.

00:37:22.090 --> 00:37:35.030
So I pray to God it won't let over him.

00:37:35.030 --> 00:38:00.889
He says draw and I'll draw close.

00:38:00.889 --> 00:38:43.510
I'll have to see if you draw close to me.

00:38:43.750 --> 00:39:52.179
And I'll have to see if you draw close to me.

00:39:52.179 --> 00:39:56.179
Did you catch the lyric in the song that said he's just a prayer way?

00:39:57.139 --> 00:40:01.219
Those are powerful words to remember when we're faced with daunting tests.

00:40:02.019 --> 00:40:05.699
Jehovah can give us not just comfort but also strength.

00:40:06.739 --> 00:40:09.940
Notice how that's highlighted in this talk by Brother Lett.

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:16.820
The theme for my discussion is never let Satan intimidate you.

00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:22.500
To intimidate means to try to get someone to do or not do something

00:40:23.059 --> 00:40:27.380
by bullying, terrorizing, threatening them.

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:30.340
And of course, Satan is a God of intimidation.

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:33.460
That's one way he tries to get people to do what he wants.

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:36.340
On the other hand, Jehovah always motivates by love.

00:40:37.139 --> 00:40:43.139
The word intimidate is found twice in the study Bible notes and the word

00:40:43.139 --> 00:40:48.260
intimidated is found once in the main text of our Bible,

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:54.659
Deuteronomy 117, where the judges who were to assist Moses were told

00:40:54.659 --> 00:40:59.059
do not be intimidated by men, render impartial judgment.

00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:04.900
But now, even though these words are not used so much in the Bible,

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:07.300
the idea is found many times.

00:41:08.099 --> 00:41:14.420
As a few examples, think of Goliath who was nine and a half feet tall trying to intimidate

00:41:15.059 --> 00:41:18.019
young David. Remember what he said to him?

00:41:18.019 --> 00:41:26.099
First Samuel chapter 17, he said, just come to me and I will give your flesh to the birds of the

00:41:26.099 --> 00:41:32.900
heavens and to the beast of the field. Just come to me little boy and I'll feed your corpse

00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:37.219
to the buzzards and hyenas. Big time intimidation.

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:43.460
Or what about the rapture cut and loud fluent Hebrew trying to intimidate the Jews

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:51.380
in the time of Hezekiah? San Ballad and Tobiah trying to ridicule Nehemiah and the Jews for

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:56.900
building the wall. Or another example found in today's Watchtower comments,

00:41:57.460 --> 00:42:03.380
Nebuchadnezzar really tried to intimidate the three Hebrews into worshipping an idol.

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:12.820
How did he do it? Well, Daniel 3 verse 1 says, he erected an immense image, almost 90 feet tall,

00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:19.940
9 feet wide. And that was intimidating in itself. But then he assembled, according to verse 2,

00:42:20.659 --> 00:42:27.780
a huge strong of people, say traps, prefects, governors, advisors, etc., etc., intimidating

00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:34.659
throng. And then verses 4 through 6, he had it loudly proclaimed, you are commanded.

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:40.579
When you hear the horn, the pipe, the zither, you must fall down and worship this image.

00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:48.659
And anyone who does not do so immediately will be thrown into the burning fiery furnace,

00:42:48.659 --> 00:42:54.980
very intimidating. But those three Hebrews remained unintimidated.

00:42:55.780 --> 00:43:02.179
But of course, Satan, as we said, tries to still use intimidation today. If you don't take

00:43:02.179 --> 00:43:09.219
this blood transfusion, you will surely die. If you don't accept this job, talking about a job

00:43:09.219 --> 00:43:15.780
that will damage you spiritually, your family will starve. Why won't you smoke this cigarette,

00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:21.460
are you afraid, are you chicken? Why won't you date this girl in your class who likes you?

00:43:22.099 --> 00:43:30.579
Are you a homosexual? Today, Satan uses intimidation. First Peter 5, 8 says, the devil walks

00:43:30.579 --> 00:43:37.460
about like a roaring lion. And often those roars take the form of intimidation,

00:43:38.099 --> 00:43:44.099
kind of like the roars of a literal lion, according to the insight book, or calculated to

00:43:44.099 --> 00:43:49.940
cause domestic animals to stampede and break out of their protective enclosure.

00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:58.739
But now, here's a question. What lessons can we learn from those three Hebrews that will help

00:43:58.739 --> 00:44:07.059
us to never let Satan intimidate us? Well, here are a few lessons. One, never quit trusting Jehovah

00:44:07.139 --> 00:44:12.900
with all your heart despite the roars of the devil. If you go to Daniel chapter 3,

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:21.219
notice how they put implicit trust in Jehovah despite this intimidating situation.

00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:27.780
Chapter 3 verse 16, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered the king,

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:35.699
oh, Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter. If it must be, our God

00:44:35.699 --> 00:44:42.739
whom we serve is able to rescue us from the burning, fiery furnace, O king, and to rescue us from

00:44:42.739 --> 00:44:50.820
your hand. But even if he does not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your

00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:58.659
gods or worship the image of gold that you have set up. See, they trusted Jehovah. Now, here's

00:44:58.659 --> 00:45:06.900
another lesson. Holy Spirit will help us remain calm, not panic, give a good answer to our

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:12.500
persecutors. When you think about what we just read, the answer they gave, amazing composure,

00:45:13.539 --> 00:45:20.420
amazing answer they gave. Obviously, Holy Spirit was working powerfully upon them, and we're promised

00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:27.139
the same will be true of us. At Luke 12, 11 and 12, Jesus said, when they bring you before public

00:45:27.139 --> 00:45:34.980
assemblies, government officials, authorities, don't be anxious about what you will say. The Holy

00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:42.260
Spirit will teach you in that hour what to say. Now, here's another lesson. Jehovah can use his

00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:50.099
powerful angels to rescue us from an intimidating situation. In the case of the three Hebrews,

00:45:50.099 --> 00:45:56.659
they were rescued miraculously. When the king looked into that furnace, instead of seeing

00:45:56.659 --> 00:46:04.579
three men bound, being cremated, he saw four walking about freely, the fourth obviously,

00:46:04.579 --> 00:46:11.059
an angel. Now, when they were brought out of that furnace, Daniel 327 says, they didn't even have

00:46:11.059 --> 00:46:16.659
the smell of fire. No hair of their body was singed. Now, we've been in homes where people are

00:46:16.659 --> 00:46:23.539
smokers, and you pick up that smell of smoke very easily. Talking about singing your hair,

00:46:23.539 --> 00:46:31.059
hair singes very easily. Some time back, I tried to light a gas stove using a match. I didn't get

00:46:31.059 --> 00:46:38.420
the timing exactly right. It blew back, burned about half the hairs off my arm, but here they didn't

00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:46.179
have a hair singed, not even the smell of smoke. Now, today, we don't expect Jehovah's angels to

00:46:46.179 --> 00:46:54.980
deliver us miraculously, but Jehovah can use them to maneuver circumstances. So we find a job to

00:46:54.980 --> 00:47:01.380
provide for our family. So we find a cooperative doctor who respects our stand on blood as just a

00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:08.099
couple of examples, or he may use the angels to strengthen us, to be faithful in the face of that

00:47:08.099 --> 00:47:14.900
fiery test. Now, here's another lesson we can learn. Firm belief in the resurrection can

00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:21.380
powerfully fortify us, even if we're threatened with death. Undoubtedly, those three Hebrews,

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:29.699
knew Job's words of Job 1413, were Job asked Jehovah to conceal him in the grave, set a time limit,

00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:36.820
and then remember him, resurrect him. Likely, they were familiar with the resurrections of Elijah,

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:42.659
and Elijah. Now, they didn't know if they'd be miraculously delivered, but they did know they

00:47:42.659 --> 00:47:48.019
would be resurrected if they kept their integrity. The same is true with us today. And that firm

00:47:48.019 --> 00:47:55.780
belief in the resurrection, if you think about it, stripped Satan of his power to intimidate us,

00:47:56.340 --> 00:48:02.659
even in the face of death. You could say that hope is like our secret weapon. Now, here's one more

00:48:02.659 --> 00:48:09.780
lesson we can learn. Remaining staunchly unintimidated will give a powerful witness to onlookers.

00:48:10.739 --> 00:48:16.260
Do you remember what the King said when they came out unharmed from that furnace? He said,

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:25.300
praise be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, for there is no other God who is able to

00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:32.900
rescue like this one. And think about this. If Netherconezzar and other Babylonian onlookers

00:48:33.539 --> 00:48:40.019
are resurrected as part of the unrighteous mention in Acts 24-15, this experience

00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:45.619
will give them a head start in the New World on taking a stand. Would you hold it? And think about

00:48:45.619 --> 00:48:52.659
even the men who threw them into the furnace who died doing so. Now, if they're resurrected,

00:48:52.659 --> 00:48:57.619
they'll be told about what happened subsequent to their untimely death. And undoubtedly,

00:48:57.619 --> 00:49:04.340
that will be an impetus to a spiritual progress in the New World. Well, the same is true today.

00:49:05.139 --> 00:49:12.820
When we stand firm unintimidated, we give a powerful witness and are many that are now in the truth

00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:22.179
as a result of such witness. Well, there we have five anti-intimidation lessons. We can learn from

00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:28.980
those three Hebrews. In review, never quit trusting Jehovah despite the roars of the devil.

00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:36.179
Two, Holy Spirit will help us remain calm, not panic, give good answer. Three, Jehovah can use

00:49:36.179 --> 00:49:44.099
his angels in various ways to rescue us from intimidating circumstances. And number four,

00:49:44.099 --> 00:49:51.619
the resurrection hope will powerfully fortify us not to be intimidated even in the face of death.

00:49:52.260 --> 00:50:00.500
And number five, remaining staunchly unintimidated, who'll give a profound witness to onlookers.

00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:09.460
So make all of us, like those three Hebrews, be determined to never let Satan intimidate us.

00:50:10.659 --> 00:50:14.739
Jehovah promises to give all of us strength, including young ones.

00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:21.460
Our young brother Elijah was just a teenager when he faced a life-changing situation.

00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:28.099
Here's his story. So how can we continue to be faithful in spite of our human weaknesses?

00:50:29.539 --> 00:50:35.460
Growing up out of like absolutely no-help problems at all. And I love playing basketball,

00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:43.860
and I enjoyed my life in the congregation. This was a kid who had his whole life in front of him.

00:50:45.619 --> 00:50:55.059
It was taken away in a moment. November of 2019, I was diagnosed with a massive brain tumor.

00:50:57.500 --> 00:51:04.380
I'm saying, like, why me? Did I do something wrong? I wanted to know why I had to happen now.

00:51:06.139 --> 00:51:12.139
16, I'm close to 18 when I think is like the prime of my life.

00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:20.389
That night before I was going to have surgery, it was probably one of the scariest nights of my life.

00:51:20.389 --> 00:51:26.949
So I wanted to be able to still do the things I love. And I really just didn't want my life to end.

00:51:29.289 --> 00:51:37.050
The count of David, that was one that was very prominent in my mind. There was many times in his life

00:51:37.050 --> 00:51:44.250
where he had to fight foes that were very scary and life-threatening. And this situation I was dealing

00:51:44.250 --> 00:51:48.969
with was pretty scary and life-threatening, but I knew Jehovah had my back.

00:51:51.050 --> 00:51:56.250
We talked about getting the brothers from HLC there to talk to back us up with the alternatives

00:51:56.250 --> 00:52:02.409
on his card. The doctor was impressed when he asked Elijah if he had any questions.

00:52:02.889 --> 00:52:07.369
And Elijah asked him a couple of questions about the procedure and then also brought up the blood

00:52:07.369 --> 00:52:14.090
issue. This showed the doctor that this was a young man who had his own stand, his own convictions.

00:52:14.090 --> 00:52:20.170
If Jehovah tells me that blood is sacred and then I'm listening.

00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:26.329
Elijah kept on reminding us that even if he doesn't wake up on this surgery bed,

00:52:26.809 --> 00:52:33.130
no matter what happens, he's still going to wake up whether it's now or in the future in paradise.

00:52:38.619 --> 00:52:44.139
They finally came out only to tell us that there was complication.

00:52:46.219 --> 00:52:53.820
Elijah fell into a coma and we were waiting on answers that the doctors weren't able to give us.

00:52:55.019 --> 00:53:00.300
It was roughly about close to five months that he was in a coma.

00:53:01.179 --> 00:53:10.940
However, Jehovah kept providing the friends, the support. We kept getting texts telling us just how

00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:17.900
many friends were praying for Elijah and for all of us to get through this.

00:53:20.869 --> 00:53:30.230
The spring of 2020 is when I gradually began to wake up. It's way harder to move around as I

00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:37.429
used to, super painful and hard. I have a taxi as of right now, temporarily in my right hand.

00:53:38.389 --> 00:53:43.829
So I'm not able to perform certain activities as well as I would like to.

00:53:47.980 --> 00:53:55.659
In my heart, I love basketball and I wish I could participate but knowing I can't because

00:53:56.219 --> 00:53:59.500
something I can't control physically, it's really hard on me.

00:54:01.099 --> 00:54:07.980
Job, he was always a great example and the Bible to me. I view him in a totally different light now

00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:15.980
because he was also hit with a medical issue. But he managed to maintain his faith

00:54:16.059 --> 00:54:21.099
and Jehovah eventually blessed Job for that. Since the coma Elijah's seal definitely has

00:54:21.099 --> 00:54:26.539
it lessened if anything gets increased. He gives a whole new meaning to widening out

00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:31.820
because we want to be as zealous and as busy in the ministry as he is.

00:54:32.699 --> 00:54:38.300
Elijah has not accomplished any of this in his own strength. He very quickly will give credit to

00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:42.860
Jehovah but also will give credit to his family for the amount of support that he's received

00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:46.860
and give credit to the brothers and sisters for the support he's received from them as well.

00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:50.940
He's been engaged in the field ministry and he's been active in doing whatever assignments we

00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:55.579
give him within the congregation. We were able to appoint him a ministerial servant.

00:54:56.139 --> 00:55:00.940
He's got all of this support. He knows that Jehovah is with him and in that sense, Jehovah truly

00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:08.059
is at his right hand. I know that we have a hope that Jehovah has given us in the future of perfect

00:55:08.139 --> 00:55:14.539
life. It gives me a goal and more of a motivation to help everyone reach that goal and get there.

00:55:14.539 --> 00:55:19.340
There's light at the end of the tunnel. So I thank Jehovah for that so much.

00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:25.750
Elijah, you are a precious gem in Jehovah's eyes.

00:55:27.429 --> 00:55:32.949
Our whole program has highlighted that each one of us has a special place in Jehovah's beautiful

00:55:32.949 --> 00:55:39.590
family. As part of the family, would you like to see the invitation video for this year's regional

00:55:39.590 --> 00:55:49.449
convention? The theme is exercise patience. When was the last time you lost your patience?

00:55:50.889 --> 00:56:00.889
On the road? At work? Or at home? Our busy lives make it difficult for us to be patient.

00:56:02.570 --> 00:56:07.849
But to enjoy life, we need patience more than ever, even if it's being tested.

00:56:08.570 --> 00:56:16.730
But what does patience really mean? Does it mean we just passively wait for something to change?

00:56:18.250 --> 00:56:28.679
And how can patience affect our daily life? The 2023 Exercise Patients Convention of Jehovah's

00:56:28.679 --> 00:56:36.920
Witnesses will show you what true patience is. Why we need it. And how it can improve our

00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:50.019
relationships with others. God wants you to be happy. And as our creator, he knows that exercising

00:56:50.019 --> 00:57:03.829
patience is vital. For more information, go to jw.org. Think of who you can share this invitation

00:57:03.829 --> 00:57:11.269
video with so that you peek their interest. Hopefully, they will attend with us. Would you like to see

00:57:11.269 --> 00:57:16.469
a little more? This year's convention will also feature a two-part modern-day drama.

00:57:17.429 --> 00:57:22.150
Now, we won't give away the storyline. But here's a preview to wet your appetite.

00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:34.760
If mom and dad were alive, they would be very proud of you.

00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:43.000
You know what I'm thinking? You could have more. I'm talking about real security for you and the

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:55.460
family. A government-capentry contract. I did an update to our report from yesterday.

00:57:55.460 --> 00:58:01.860
Malaysia groups are threatening to take over the capital. Violence has been escalating in the area.

00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:07.219
As you are aware, the branch has recommended that we meet and discuss the possibility of

00:58:07.219 --> 00:58:12.019
civil unrest in our area. There will always be rumors surrounding the elections.

00:58:12.739 --> 00:58:15.380
The safety of the congregation is the concern.

00:58:20.070 --> 00:58:27.079
There's no need to worry. These are just threats. Rumors. There's nothing to it.

00:58:29.079 --> 00:58:37.079
We received direction from the branch. Those brothers are so far away though. I keep wondering if

00:58:37.079 --> 00:58:48.380
they have been overly cautious. Remember, Amani. Your strength will be in keeping calm.

00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:58.230
Are you still trusting these people to guide your life?

00:58:59.909 --> 00:59:03.989
Father Jehovah, please help me.

00:59:12.889 --> 00:59:17.929
The governing body has approved a new original song to conclude the convention.

00:59:18.730 --> 00:59:25.130
I'm happy to announce that the song and lyrics are now available for download on JW.org.

00:59:26.170 --> 00:59:30.170
The governing body requests that everyone practice before the convention,

00:59:30.809 --> 00:59:34.170
so that unitedly we can sing out with all our hearts.

00:59:35.369 --> 00:59:41.289
Some will need help to download the song. Please keep them in mind and provide help as needed.

00:59:42.329 --> 00:59:47.610
Perhaps you can even practice singing the song with them in preparation for the convention.

00:59:48.889 --> 00:59:52.889
As you can see, we have a lot to look forward to in the months ahead.

00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:57.449
Further evidence of how much Jehovah cherishes his people.

00:59:59.769 --> 01:00:06.489
Now, for this month's video postcard, let's travel to the heart of the Mediterranean Sea,

01:00:06.489 --> 01:00:13.929
where we find the island nation of Malta. Malta is made up of five small islands,

01:00:14.809 --> 01:00:18.010
three of which are inhabited, Malta the largest,

01:00:19.130 --> 01:00:27.849
Gozo and Tiny Comino, which has an area of just one square mile or about three square kilometers.

01:00:28.889 --> 01:00:34.329
These islands are known for their rocky coastlines and steep limestone cliffs.

01:00:35.289 --> 01:00:42.250
Malta's location with Italy to the north and Africa to the south is reflected in this language.

01:00:43.130 --> 01:00:47.210
Maltees is a blend of an Arabic dialect spoken in North Africa,

01:00:47.769 --> 01:00:50.329
with Sicilian a dialect of Italian.

01:00:51.050 --> 01:00:56.489
Spoken Maltees sounds like Arabic, but it's written using a Latin alphabet.

01:00:57.610 --> 01:01:01.369
Maltees in English are the country's two official languages.

01:01:02.809 --> 01:01:08.250
The many harbors and beaches found throughout Malta might bring to mind it's one and only

01:01:08.250 --> 01:01:16.010
mention in the Bible. It was along these shores that in 58 CE, the Apostle Paul was shipwrecked

01:01:16.010 --> 01:01:22.329
on his way to Rome. The Bible says that the islanders showed Paul and his companions extra

01:01:22.329 --> 01:01:28.730
ordinary kindness, and many of the Maltees people today have responded favorably to the good news.

01:01:29.289 --> 01:01:33.929
In modern times, the preaching work was established here in the 1970s.

01:01:34.570 --> 01:01:39.289
There are 11 congregations in Malta with over 800 total publishers.

01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:43.769
Many people on the islands have migrated from parts of Africa,

01:01:43.769 --> 01:01:49.530
Eastern Europe, and the Philippines. So the congregations preach in eight different languages.

01:01:50.570 --> 01:01:55.610
The brothers in Malta enjoy public witnessing throughout the islands including the port of Valetta,

01:01:56.250 --> 01:02:01.210
where Tagalog congregation preaches to the many Filipinos who work on the ships that visit the

01:02:01.210 --> 01:02:08.489
harbor. On the island of Gozo, there are two congregations, one Maltees and the other English,

01:02:09.130 --> 01:02:13.929
with a combined total of 112 publishers and 34 pioneers.

01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:19.929
The Bethel family in Malta, along with the brothers and sisters in Gozo,

01:02:19.929 --> 01:02:25.369
send their love to you all. From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,
