In July 2018, a long-cubated event took place in Lviv, Ukraine, the big, courageous, special convention.

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:15.099
The delegates were arriving from nine different countries at all times of day and night.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.100
Even so, all of them were warmly welcomed by local brothers and sisters.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.100
When we got here, we were picked up and everything was just perfectly organized.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:32.100
It was about a year and a half, brothers in various departments were preparing for this event.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.100
We are confident in Jehovah's blessing and support.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:43.100
The delegates also worked with local publishers in the field service, inviting the residents of Lviv to the convention.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:52.100
The branch office organized different excursions, tours in the ancient city center and reached the delegates not only culturally, but also spiritually.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.100
On some buildings, they could see Bible citations and tetragramaton of God's name.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.640
Outside of Lviv, tours included visiting the picturesque Carpathian Mountains region.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.640
The delegates also visited three castles, in which art and historical exhibitions were on display.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.640
In the Swedish castle, they enjoyed a dancing program, in which about 90 brothers and sisters participated.

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:35.469
In the branch office, guests learned about the work done by each department and got acquainted with the battle family, who had prepared a special program for them.

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:44.939
The evening gathering program consisted of songs, dances and a video about the history of Jehovah's Witnesses in Ukraine.

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.939
It encouraged the guests a lot. Many of them were even moved to tears.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.700
At the same time, preparations at the stadium were underway.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.700
We are waiting for the moment when this whole stadium will be filled with faithful servants of Jehovah.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.699
It's a special privilege for the branch committee in Ukraine to warmly welcome all of you.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.860
We couldn't speak the language. You could barely say any words to each other, but the hugs and you could feel the love and that's why it was so special.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:28.860
The convention program was held in four languages, Ukrainian, English, Russian and Russian sign language.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.860
It helped everyone to be courageous despite any trials.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:46.860
A special time for me to be able to be with my brothers and sisters and learn to have courage despite difficulties.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:55.860
The big attendance at the convention was 25,489, with 255 being baptized.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.650
May Jehovah richly bless all of you. You will never regret the decision you made today.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:15.900
If God is for us, no one can be against us.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:23.900
So put your trust in Jehovah because there are more who are with us than against us.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:36.340
I could say one thing that stood out to me is that it taught me hospitality at a level that I've never experienced before.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.340
The way the brothers and sisters have been kind to us and treated us is a lesson that I'll bring back with me.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.080
We can see that love. It's just another demonstration that we are at the true religion.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.080
And this is Jehovah's organization, so it's all thanks to him.
