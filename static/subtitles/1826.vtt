00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:08.679
My name is Sting Dot. I was born in 1988 in Darwin non-territory.

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:15.679
When I was eight years old, I realised that life was getting very difficult for me.

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:21.679
I was diagnosed with ADHD, obsessive compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome.

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:25.679
And on top of all of that, I was diagnosed with severe anxiety as well.

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:32.679
My mum said this affected the entire family because I would repeatedly yell out goodnight

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:35.679
to each individual person in the family.

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:43.679
And on top of that, I used to constantly go around the house, checking the locks and the windows.

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:48.679
My school life was the hardest thing I'd ever had to deal with.

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:52.679
And my school was approximately 500 metres from my home.

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:55.679
It would take me at least two hours to get to school.

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:00.679
Because one of my obsessions was there was cracks on the footpath.

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:06.680
And if I stepped on one, I'd have to go all the way back home and start again.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.680
I found life to be a constant struggle.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.680
And as I got older, it only got worse.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.680
Even at 10 years old, I decided that I wanted to end my life.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.680
So it would make everyone in the family's life a lot easier.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.680
But then we decided to use some medication, which eased my problems a little bit.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.680
Despite having medication, life was still completely unbearable for me.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.680
I had a constant struggle every day within myself.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.680
I used to wash my hands hundreds of times a day.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.680
I couldn't leave the home, I couldn't get a driver's license, I couldn't even get a job.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.680
A major turning point in my life was my mum's unwavering faith in Jehovah.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.680
She used to iron my clothes for the meeting and hang him on the door knob,

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.680
even though that wasn't ready to attend the meeting.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.680
But what she didn't know was when my mum went to the meeting with my sister,

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.680
I'd get a Bible and I'd try and start to read it.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.680
I also began to pray to Jehovah.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.680
And then one day I thought, I'm going to give this a shot.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.680
So I put my suit on, I got ready, and I went to the meeting.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.680
When I went to the Kingdom Hall, I was absolutely terrified.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.680
I was so nervous. But when I got there, I saw an elder who used to come and visit me.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.680
And he made me feel very relaxed.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.680
And then the amazing welcome by the brothers and sisters,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.680
made me feel like I was part of Jehovah's organization again.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.680
The scripture that really helped me was 1 Peter 5 verse 7,

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.680
because it says, while you throw all your anxiety on him, because he cares for you.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.680
So this made me feel like I had a very powerful friend

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.680
and Jehovah wanted me to throw my anxieties on him because he loved me.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.680
On September 4, 2010, it was my most important day of my life.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.680
I got baptized as one of Jehovah's Witnesses at Adelaide Entertainment Centre.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.680
Well, now serve as a ministerial servant.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.680
I've had the privilege of giving public talks,

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.680
which is something I never thought I'd ever be able to do.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.680
I completed Pioneer School after three attempts,

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.680
because the Pioneer School environment made me feel like I was back at school

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.680
and made me have anxiety again.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.680
So the third time I completed it, and none of this would ever have been possible

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.680
without Jehovah's help.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.680
On the 6th of August 2016, I married my beautiful wife, Laura,

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.680
who helped me serve Jehovah, and we can serve Jehovah every day together.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.680
I, like the Apostle Paul, still feel like I have a war inside me sometimes.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.680
But definitely, Jehovah has never let me down.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.680
Never give up on serving Jehovah, because Jehovah will never give up on you.
