00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:06.780
Today, the judge of the Togunruk city court, Alisei Vasucchenko,

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.259
took his talk about the criminal case of the 16th Anniversary of the Yegovs.

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:16.940
He said that the four of us, of course, were the most than five years of the current conclusion,

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.940
and also put on them the great punishments.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.780
The punishments were significant and the 12th of all, according to the judge.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:29.300
The judge is not based on the use of the criminal law of extremism to the service of the Yegovs.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.539
And precisely, the malice, the sin, the reading and the discussion of the Bible.

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:39.219
To all that, what is the matter, all the witnesses of the Yegovs in the whole world?

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:44.060
Fortunately, the decision of the freedom of the judge was to consider the conditions.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.700
Also, the judge does not need to pay the fines.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.700
However, we do not know what this conditions of the judge will be meant to judge them on the practice.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.700
The judge creates a dangerous precedent for the freedom of the Russian people.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.380
The purpose of the Russian government is to further investigate the Yegovs' world,

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.379
only for the fact that they are peaceful and lead their religion.

00:01:08.379 --> 00:01:14.659
The third is that the authorities in other regions of Russia follow the example of Togunruk.

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.099
They are trying to limit the legal activities of the Yegovs' people.

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:22.500
We will be sorry for today's conversation.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.260
Russia has taken the responsibility to look at the constitution and international agreements

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.819
to ensure the religious freedom.

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:38.579
We are sure that the legal activities of the judge must be taken to the right to assess what has happened.

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.700
This is the real religious investigation.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.379
We hope that this will be a terrible injustice.
