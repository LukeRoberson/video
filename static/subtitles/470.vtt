WEBVTT

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:07.879
Well, what did Jesus mean when he said, I give you my peace?

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:13.880
What was the peace that Jesus gave to his disciples?

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.879
Well, the watchtower of 2009, October 15, page 9,

00:00:19.879 --> 00:00:23.879
had a very, very nice definition. Here's what it said.

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:28.879
The peace that Christ leaves with his disciples

00:00:28.879 --> 00:00:35.880
is the inner calm they experience when they feel that they are loved

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.880
and approved by Jehovah God and his beloved Son.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.880
Now, did you get that definition?

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.880
The inner calm that they experience when they feel that they are loved

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.880
and approved by Jehovah God and his beloved Son.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.880
What a beautiful definition.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.880
And even more so, what a beautiful gift is the peace that Jesus gives

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.879
to all of those who are his true disciples.

00:01:05.879 --> 00:01:12.879
But what if we begin to feel that we're losing our inner peace?

00:01:12.879 --> 00:01:18.879
What can we do to get it back and then to maintain it?

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:20.879
Well, those are important questions.

00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:24.879
Let's talk in our discussion this morning about three things

00:01:24.879 --> 00:01:31.879
that could cause us to begin to lose that feeling of inner peace.

00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:33.879
Now, here's the first one.

00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:39.879
Doubting that Jehovah really loves and approves us.

00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:43.879
You know, when we go through periods of discouragement

00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:46.879
or perhaps periods of increased anxiety,

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:50.879
we may begin to feel that really no one loves us,

00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:52.879
that no one appreciates us.

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:55.879
And that can even extend to Jehovah.

00:01:55.879 --> 00:02:00.879
We begin to feel, well, I don't even think Jehovah loves me anymore.

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:07.879
Well, of course, that's just exactly what Satan the devil wants us to think.

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:13.879
Because if we convince ourselves that Jehovah doesn't love us and he doesn't approve us,

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.879
well, then we're going to give up.

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.879
We're not going to continue on in our race for life.

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.879
Well, how can we fight back against this?

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:30.879
Well, we have to reassure ourselves that Jehovah really does love us.

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:35.879
We have to sense how precious we are to God.

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:40.879
Now, let's just think about one simple thought that might encourage us along this way.

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:41.879
Let's go in our Bibles.

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:48.879
Let's look at first Chronicles chapter 28 and verse 9.

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:54.699
Now, you'll notice about midway down the verse,

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:58.020
it says,

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.020
Jehovah searches through all hearts

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:08.020
and he discerns every inclination of the thoughts.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.020
Now, think about that.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:16.020
Now, as Jehovah is searching through all the hearts that are on this planet,

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.020
can you imagine the horrible things that Jehovah sees?

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.020
But what about when Jehovah comes to a heart like yours?

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:33.020
When he sees a heart that has love for him, that is in fear of him?

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:39.020
Well, now, can you imagine how joyful Jehovah is to see a heart like that?

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.020
Well, you might say to yourself,

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.020
I'm not important.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.020
I'm not special.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.020
I don't do anything that's noteworthy.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.020
Why would Jehovah take notice of me?

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.020
Well, again, let's look at another simple thought that might encourage you.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:59.020
It's Malachi chapter 3 and verse 16.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.840
Now, just notice what it says here.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.840
At that time, those who feared Jehovah spoke with one another,

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.840
each one with his companion.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.839
And Jehovah kept paying attention and listening.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:22.839
And a book of remembrance was written before him for those fearing Jehovah

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:26.839
and for those meditating on his name.

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:29.839
Now, when we read this verse,

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:37.839
did you notice that these ones that Jehovah noticed were doing anything major or profound or outstanding?

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:43.839
Well, the verse just says that those who were in fear of Jehovah spoke with one another.

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:46.839
Well, that's what we do all day long, isn't it?

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:48.839
Maybe it's via Zoom,

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:53.839
but we're constantly speaking with one another about our love for God.

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:56.839
Well, Jehovah pays attention.

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:57.839
And what does he do?

00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:04.839
Well, the verse goes on to say that he writes the names of those who are fearing him,

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:10.839
those meditating on his name, he writes them in his book of remembrance, his book of life.

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:15.839
How wonderful, how amazing that Jehovah would take care to notice us.

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:17.839
So what's the point?

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:22.839
Brothers, you don't have to do anything major, profound, outstanding.

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:27.839
If you fear God, if you love him, Jehovah loves you.

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:29.839
He views you as someone precious.

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:32.839
So accept, accept Jehovah's love.

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:34.839
Don't fight it.

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:39.839
Don't think of all the reasons why you can't be loved by God.

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:41.839
Accept it.

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:44.839
And when those anxious thoughts flood into your mind,

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:46.839
and you begin to doubt your value,

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:49.839
and you begin to feel I'm just not worthless,

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:52.839
or I don't have any value with Jehovah,

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:56.839
well, follow the advice here in Philippians chapter four.

00:05:56.839 --> 00:06:00.839
Now, this is a well-known scripture, but we need to keep reading it,

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:03.839
because this is a recipe for success.

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:07.839
Philippians chapter four, verse six.

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:11.839
It says, do not be anxious over anything,

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:15.839
but in everything by prayer and supplication,

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:17.839
along with Thanksgiving,

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:21.839
let your petitions be made known to God.

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:23.839
Well, what's the point?

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:27.839
You see, brothers, during these times of pandemic,

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:31.839
when there are so many trials going on in our lives,

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:34.839
we may feel an increased amount of anxiety,

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:38.839
we have to pour out our heart to Jehovah.

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:40.839
It's not just a matter of saying,

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:42.839
Jehovah, I'm feeling anxious,

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:44.839
but we need to linger in prayer,

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:48.839
and really talk to Jehovah about how we're feeling,

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:51.839
really express all the fears,

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:53.839
all the concerns that we have.

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:56.839
But then, do you notice that other detail in verse six?

00:06:56.839 --> 00:06:59.839
It says, along with Thanksgiving.

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:03.839
So we have to take time to thank Jehovah for all our blessings.

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:06.839
You know, if you start in prayer to thank Jehovah

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:08.839
for all the blessings you have in your life,

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:10.839
it's going to take you some time,

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:12.839
because really, we have so many blessings

00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:15.839
when we just take time to ponder them and thank Jehovah.

00:07:15.839 --> 00:07:17.839
Well, when we do that,

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:19.839
what happens according to verse seven?

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:22.839
We experience that peace of God,

00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:27.839
that inner peace that calms those anxious feelings.

00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:31.839
What's the second thing that can rob us of our inner peace?

00:07:31.839 --> 00:07:35.839
It's comparing ourselves with others.

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:38.839
You know, this really can be another form of questioning

00:07:38.839 --> 00:07:40.839
Jehovah's love for us.

00:07:40.839 --> 00:07:43.839
You know, it can be like saying,

00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:47.839
I think Jehovah loves that brother more than me.

00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:49.839
I see that brother or that sister,

00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:52.839
they have privileges I don't have.

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:56.839
So maybe Jehovah doesn't love me as much as he loves them.

00:07:56.839 --> 00:08:00.839
Well, that's another recipe for disaster, isn't it?

00:08:00.839 --> 00:08:03.839
Maybe we grew up in a situation where we were always

00:08:03.839 --> 00:08:05.839
compared with others.

00:08:05.839 --> 00:08:07.839
Did your parents say to you things like,

00:08:07.839 --> 00:08:09.839
why can't you be like your brother?

00:08:09.839 --> 00:08:12.839
Why can't you be like brother elder's son?

00:08:12.839 --> 00:08:16.839
Well, if we listen to that all the time we were growing up,

00:08:16.839 --> 00:08:21.839
maybe we have that tendency now to compare ourselves with others.

00:08:21.839 --> 00:08:27.839
But what is the principle of Galatians chapter six and verse four?

00:08:27.839 --> 00:08:32.840
It tells us that we should examine our own actions.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:37.840
And then we'll have a cause for rejoicing in regard to ourselves alone

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.840
and not in comparison with the other person.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.840
What's the point?

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.840
We have to set our own personal goals.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:51.840
We have to get joy and satisfaction from reaching those goals

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.840
and see the gifts that Jehovah has given us

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:59.840
and then use those gifts to strengthen and encourage and build up others.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:04.840
In that way, you see, we stop comparing ourselves with others

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:11.840
and we find joy in seeing what we have and what we can give to Jehovah

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.840
and to our brothers and sisters.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:17.840
It helps us to maintain our inner peace.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.840
But then here's the last one.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:25.840
Filling our minds with negative information.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.840
Well, we always want to keep on the watch.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:28.840
That's true.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:35.840
But a steady diet of the sad, divisive, angry, hate-filled information

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:41.840
that just is flooding the news media today can begin to wear us down.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.840
And we can begin to feel our inner peace going away

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:49.840
because of all of this negative information.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.840
Well, what do we need to do?

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.840
Well, we might have to turn it off.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.840
We might have to put a limit on how much we watch.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:03.840
But at the same time, we have to fill our minds with positive, encouraging ideas.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.840
In Psalm 94 and verse 19, do you remember what Jehovah promised here?

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:14.149
Look at Psalm 94 and verse 19.

00:10:14.149 --> 00:10:24.350
It says, when anxieties overwhelmed me, you comforted and soothed me.
