00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:15.460
Like a sheep he was brought to the slaughter, and like a lamb that is silent before its

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:21.699

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:24.300
Do you actually know what you're reading?

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.300
Really?

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.379
How could I ever do so unless someone guided me?

00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:33.979
So he urged Philip to get on and sit down with him.

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:41.299
I beg you about whom does a prophet say this, about himself, or about some other man?

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:42.299

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:47.899
Philip began to speak, and starting with this scripture, he declared to him the good news

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:48.899
about Jesus.
