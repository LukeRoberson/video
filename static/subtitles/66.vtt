00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:12.619
Welcome to JW Broadcasting. This is my friend and co-host Isark Mare. Isark was in

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:18.620
store for this month's program. Thank you brother Mouche. This month will

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:25.420
examine the many ways Jehovah assures us that he is with us. Our music video for

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.219
this month shows how from the moment that we start to take steps towards

00:00:30.219 --> 00:00:36.780
dedication and baptism Jehovah draws close to us. Jehovah is also with us in the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.780
ministry. In this report we'll see how he blessed a special preaching effort in

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.420
Europe and Jehovah is with us as we meet challenges of daily life as our

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:58.140
sister Rita and her children learned. That sounds exciting. Let's get started. This

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:23.180
is the November 2019 edition of JW Broadcasting. Millions have benefited from the

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.780
animated series become Jehovah's Friend and many other Bible based videos. Have

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.659
you enjoyed getting to know Caleb and Sophia? When you watch the video perhaps

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.219
you've wondered how does the governing body know that the video will turn out

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:47.700
exactly right. How can they see and hear the video before it exists? Let's go

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:58.430
behind the scenes and see how this works. Animated videos like those in this

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.349
series become Jehovah's Friend have been helping young ones draw closer to

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:18.159
their heavenly father for several years now. But did you know what you see on

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:24.800
the screen might last just a few short minutes. But it may involve weeks of

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:34.080
work by a virtual army of volunteers. With so much time and expense involved in

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.919
making an animated video a lot of careful planning is required to avoid waste

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:45.560
and keep the process running smoothly. Let's take a look at how effective use of

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.560
pre-production tools help all these brothers and sisters work together to

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.800
take a video from initial concept to a final production. Under the direction of

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.319
the teaching committee of the governing body, the work begins long before the

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.080
artist even gets started. They provide the direction on the theme that needs to

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.599
be taught. Members of the animation team collaborate to develop the featured

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:17.240
characters as well as plot structure. And we're closely with writers and

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:23.960
storyboard artists to develop the approved idea into a storyline. Once a

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:29.560
complete script is ready, the whole team gathers together for a table read. This is

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.280
the first time the team hears the whole script being read aloud. Dialogs meant to

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.560
be heard. So when we read it aloud at the table read, we pick up on things we

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.439
didn't see in the written script. We're able to tighten the story and make it as

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:48.840
clear as possible. The script is reviewed by the research team for accuracy.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.520
Then it's revised, polished, and submitted to the teaching committee for approval.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:00.319
With an approved script in hand, the director then works with an artist to start

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:08.000
turning words into pictures, visualizing each scene on a storyboard. First come

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.360
the rough boards showing what will be included in each shot. When it comes to

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.000
the animation world, really everything you see on screen has to be designed and

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.040
created. From the characters, furniture, the props, the environment are all

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.240
created by a designer. The storyboard really helps us figure out what exactly we

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:36.410
need to create so that we're not creating too much or too long. Once approved by

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:43.490
the director, the storyboard artist cleans up each of the boards. Preliminary

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:51.199
recordings of dialogue, music, and sound effects are added. These are then used

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:58.959
by the director and compositor to create an animatic. An animatic is a rough

00:04:58.959 --> 00:05:04.959
draft of the entire video. The animatic is very important for us. Now we the

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:09.439
director and more importantly, the teaching committee. They can see the entire

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:14.079
video before actually making it and with that they can review it and give us a

00:05:14.079 --> 00:05:19.560
proper direction. The finished animatic is submitted to the teaching committee

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.639
for review. Based on direction from the committee, the team makes sure that the

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:29.560
teaching points come across clearly and that the finished product is true to

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:36.639
the spirit and intent of the approved concept for the video. Finally, using the

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:46.930
approved animatic as a blueprint, full production begins. Really everything in

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:52.970
animation can be very time consuming. An animator working full-time here at

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:58.769
Bethel may be able to produce four to six seconds of animation in one week and

00:05:58.769 --> 00:06:02.410
that doesn't even include other aspects that are very important such as

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:09.769
modeling, rigging, lighting, compositing, and many others. From the examples shown

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:15.610
here, you can see just how closely the final version of the video make Jehovah

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:23.980
happy follows the animatic. Pre-production tools such as storyboards and

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:29.459
animatics do more than save the organization time and money. They enable the

00:06:29.459 --> 00:06:34.860
teaching committee to carefully evaluate every project along the way from the

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:41.339
initial approved concept to the final product in order to keep providing videos

00:06:41.339 --> 00:06:53.110
that help all of us honor our friend Jehovah. Isn't it amazing to see all the

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:59.629
work that goes into our videos? Jehovah provides for his people just what they

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:08.189
need at the right time. Truly, he is with these people. Brother Lush, I know you

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:14.949
have some thoughts on this. I'd like to talk about a very common expression in

00:07:14.949 --> 00:07:23.790
the Bible. The expression is, I am with you. 13 times it's attributed to a

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:30.550
statement from Jehovah. Three times it's something that Jesus said to one or more

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:36.629
of his disciples. Of course, there are dozens of other times that the same

00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:43.110
sentiment is expressed using similar wording. Few things in the world equal

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:50.829
the joy humans experience than the birth of a child. As children grow up, they

00:07:50.829 --> 00:07:56.829
are sometimes exposed to situations that tend to cause nervousness or even fear.

00:07:56.829 --> 00:08:05.029
So a parent may occasionally feel compelled to reassure a child. Have no fear. I am

00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:14.060
with you. Jehovah loves his services if they were his children. Likewise, at John

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:22.379
131, Jesus' feelings for his disciples are well expressed. There it says, Jesus

00:08:22.379 --> 00:08:30.459
having loved his own who were in the world loved them to the end. So when we face

00:08:30.459 --> 00:08:38.220
fears, trials or causes for anxiety, both our Heavenly Father and his son, Jesus,

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:47.860
we assuredly say, I am with you. Think of the righteous man, Noah. Genesis 6.9 says

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:56.059
that Noah walked with the true God. There's no doubt that Jehovah was with Noah. He

00:08:56.059 --> 00:09:02.340
preserved him and his family through the flood. Afterward, Jehovah further

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:09.220
proved he was with Noah. In Genesis 9, Jehovah said, I am now establishing my

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:14.899
covenant with you. Never again will all flesh be destroyed by the waters of the

00:09:14.899 --> 00:09:21.899
flood. Jehovah could have made that determination and promised himself that he

00:09:21.899 --> 00:09:27.700
wouldn't do that again, but instead he reached out to Noah and reassured him

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:35.100
that he was with him by making the rainbow covenant with Noah and his offspring.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:43.340
Using similar terminology, Jehovah indicated that he was with Abraham, Isaac,

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:50.980
Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Joshua and Gideon. They were all individuals that Jehovah

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:59.299
was pleased with, so he reassured them he was with them. How about a group of

00:09:59.299 --> 00:10:05.179
people? Is Jehovah moved to feel the same way toward a large crowd of his

00:10:05.179 --> 00:10:18.429
servants collectively? Please find with me Exodus 6, verse 6 and 7. The whole

00:10:18.429 --> 00:10:25.389
nation of Israel was experiencing severe trials and suffering as slaves in Egypt.

00:10:25.389 --> 00:10:30.029
Notice Jehovah's reassurance to the fast number of people.

00:10:30.029 --> 00:10:39.909
Verses 6 and 7 stayed. Therefore, say to the Israelites, I am Jehovah and I will

00:10:39.909 --> 00:10:45.190
bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians and rescue you from

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:50.909
their slavery and I will reclaim you with an outstretched arm and with great

00:10:50.909 --> 00:10:56.350
judgments and I will take you in as my people and I will be your God and you will

00:10:56.350 --> 00:11:01.750
certainly know that I am Jehovah your God who is bringing you out from under the

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:07.350
burdens of Egypt. If that great mixed group of people would follow his

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:14.389
leadings, he said he'd take them in. He would be their God. What was he saying? He

00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:23.389
was reassuring them. I will be with you and he was for 40 years in the wilderness.

00:11:23.389 --> 00:11:29.269
He was with them feeding them, providing water for them and ensuring their

00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:35.350
clothes and sandals would not way out protecting them from poisonous snakes and

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:41.149
so forth. And later, when entering the land of promise, he protected them

00:11:41.149 --> 00:11:49.669
during enemy warfare. Jehovah promised to be with and to support the kings of

00:11:49.669 --> 00:11:56.629
Israel as long as they heeded his commandments and direction. King Solomon was

00:11:56.629 --> 00:12:03.750
told, Jehovah, you God will not desert you or abandon you but he will be with

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:13.039
you. King Acer was informed. Jehovah is with you as long as you remain with him.

00:12:13.039 --> 00:12:20.659
When faced with overwhelming enemy forces, King Jehosephat was told,

00:12:20.659 --> 00:12:29.220
tomorrow go out against them and Jehovah will be with you. Jehovah also proved to

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:34.500
be with the many prophets that he sent out in his name. Just one example is

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:41.340
Jeremiah. Imagine if you had Jeremiah's assignment. Suppose you had been

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:46.740
directed to deliver a scathing denunciation and judgment against wicked

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:53.500
kings, corrupt priests and false prophets. How would you feel under qualified?

00:12:53.500 --> 00:13:01.340
Would you feel like a little child challenging a whole group of evil grownups?

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:11.340
Notice how Jeremiah felt as he expressed himself at Jeremiah chapter 1, verse 6.

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:19.179
But I said alas or so in Lord Jehovah, I do not know how to speak for I'm just a

00:13:19.179 --> 00:13:28.700
boy. What were Jehovah's reassuring words in reply? Jeremiah 1, 8 and 9, do not

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:35.659
be afraid because of their appearance for I am with you to save you, declares Jehovah.

00:13:35.659 --> 00:13:40.460
Then Jehovah stretched out his hand and touched my mouth and Jehovah said to me,

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:49.259
I have put my words in your mouth. If Jehovah put the words that you were to say in your mouth,

00:13:49.259 --> 00:13:56.539
you'd no longer feel like a little child, would you? We don't think of Jeremiah as being an

00:13:56.539 --> 00:14:04.620
incredible Superman. He was a human like us. It's of interest that though Jeremiah lived in

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:13.500
another time and place, he faced situations similar to those we face. We interact with different

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:20.860
types of people in our daily life at work and at school. Some of them can be intimidating.

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:29.899
And like Jeremiah, Jehovah has commissioned us to go to strangers and preach. We share the good

00:14:29.899 --> 00:14:38.779
news of the kingdom. Some are interested, others are just plain apathetic, but at times we may come

00:14:38.779 --> 00:14:46.940
across someone who is angry and may even be threatening. This is the time to remember Jeremiah.

00:14:47.419 --> 00:14:55.980
Though initially timid, he courageously faced the challenge of an intimidating response.

00:14:55.980 --> 00:15:06.059
How did he rally to the occasion? It was because Jehovah had reassured him, I am with you.

00:15:06.059 --> 00:15:16.820
He said, I have put my words in your mouth. Does Jehovah do something similar for us?

00:15:17.779 --> 00:15:24.259
Yes. Long after Jeremiah and the other faithful ones that were recorded in the Hebrew

00:15:24.259 --> 00:15:31.940
scriptures came and went, Jehovah has proved to be with true Christians both past and present.

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:46.269
Find with me John chapter 8. Think of Jesus. It's true he was a perfect man, but did Jehovah leave

00:15:46.269 --> 00:15:57.149
him all alone? John 8.16, what did Jesus himself say? And yet even if I do judge, my judgment

00:15:57.149 --> 00:16:04.990
is truthful because I am not alone, but the Father who sent me is with me. We might be thinking

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:11.470
of that intimidating person in the ministry. Even if you are facing the person without the fellow

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:21.149
witness standing beside you, are you really all alone? Jesus knew that at the most stressful

00:16:21.149 --> 00:16:28.830
and emotionally draining time during his human life, his disciples would leave him all alone,

00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:40.190
but was he really alone? Let's read the inspired account at John 1632. Again, these are Jesus'

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:47.389
own words. Look, the hour is coming, indeed it has come, when each one of you will be scattered

00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:55.629
to his own house and you will leave me alone, but I am not alone because the Father is with me.

00:16:56.909 --> 00:17:03.070
Jesus was not alone during his most anxious moments, Jehovah was with him.

00:17:03.549 --> 00:17:11.150
If you think you are alone standing at the door of an irritated householder, think again.

00:17:11.869 --> 00:17:20.190
Jehovah is with you. You have more with you than if you had your whole congregation standing in

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:31.069
the person's front yard. Well, why did Jesus share this precious insight with us? Look at the next

00:17:31.069 --> 00:17:41.470
verse. Jesus explains his reason for saying what he did, John 1633. I have said these things to

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:49.069
you so that by means of me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation, but take

00:17:49.069 --> 00:17:57.549
courage, I have conquered the world. We thank Jesus for addressing our fears and concerns when

00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:05.230
giving a witness. Instead of trembling with fear, he shared his confidence in Jehovah's support

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:12.990
so that we may have peace. He acknowledged that we would face tribulation, but he said we could

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:22.509
look at his example and have courage to deal with tribulation. Why? Jesus said in verse 32,

00:18:22.509 --> 00:18:30.269
it was because the Father was with him. Do you recall that Jehovah told Jeremiah,

00:18:30.269 --> 00:18:38.990
I have put my words in your mouth? Can Jehovah do the same for us when we are opposed by

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:48.109
unbelievers? The Christian Greek scriptures answer with a resounding yes. Please follow along

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:57.950
with the reading of the book of Mark chapter 13. And please notice that the setting Jesus describes

00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:05.710
is the ministry preaching the good news. Maybe you've had a good morning in service,

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:14.029
but then you take one more door. The person is irate and even calls the police. What should you do?

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:23.470
What will you say when the police arrive? You don't have to be overly concerned. Why not?

00:19:24.349 --> 00:19:31.309
Because similar to Jeremiah, Jehovah will in effect put his words in your mouth.

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:41.150
Mark 13, 10 and 11 says, also in all the nations, the good news has to be preached first.

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:49.789
And when they are taking you to hand you over, do not be anxious beforehand about what to say.

00:19:50.589 --> 00:19:57.710
But whatever is given to you in that hour, say this, for you are not the one speaking,

00:19:58.349 --> 00:20:06.910
but the Holy Spirit is. By this, do we mean that Jehovah will miraculously put words in your mouth

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:17.230
for you to say? Not necessarily. Did you notice verse 11 said that the Holy Spirit is the one

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:25.069
speaking? You've been taught the basis for your faith from the scriptures. And you know the reason

00:20:25.069 --> 00:20:33.230
that you teach the Bible's message, that's all stored in your mind. So what's the Holy

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:39.789
Spirit's role when we are in an intimidating situation, when sharing the good news?

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:49.950
Jehovah is with you. He uses his Holy Spirit to bring to the surface some of those precious gems

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:58.349
that might be buried in your mind. You may be amazed at what you remember when put under pressure

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:05.549
by the authorities or even by outright opposers. In this way, Jehovah is with you.

00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:15.980
Add to the fact that Jesus is with you in the disciple making work. Let's be reminded of this

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:27.579
very encouraging thought at Matthew 28, 19 and 20. Jesus was discussing our commission to preach,

00:21:27.579 --> 00:21:35.180
teach, and make disciples. And how does he conclude the Bible book of Matthew? Let's read Matthew

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:44.779
28 verses 19 and 20. Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations,

00:21:44.779 --> 00:21:49.980
baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,

00:21:50.619 --> 00:21:58.460
teaching them to observe all the things I've commanded you. And look, I am with you all the days

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:06.779
until the conclusion of the system of things. Jesus said that he is with us now when we are making

00:22:06.779 --> 00:22:15.180
disciples and teaching people the truth, and he promises he'll support us in this important work

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:22.619
until the end of this wicked system of things. As prophesied during this time of the conclusion

00:22:22.619 --> 00:22:30.619
of the system, we are being persecuted in different areas of the world. As the scriptures

00:22:30.619 --> 00:22:38.539
show Satan and his angels are misleading the entire inhabited earth. Recently, Jehovah's people

00:22:38.539 --> 00:22:45.980
have been persecuted in Russia. But will the persecution succeed in eliminating true worship

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:57.740
in that area of the world? No. Why not? It's because Jehovah is with them. He and Jesus promised,

00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:06.299
I am with you. Russia did not learn from the past. It will prove to be the same for them as it was

00:23:06.299 --> 00:23:14.140
for Nazi Germany under Hitler. Hitler thought his regime could eradicate true worship and God's

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:21.660
people from areas under their control, but they made a big mistake. While it is true, they murdered

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:31.339
some 2000 brothers. In the end, the scheme ended up in failure. Why? Because God was with us,

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:41.970
not with them. God with us, those words have decorated national emblems and even the uniforms of

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:49.490
soldiers of Prussia and the Sari's Russian Empire. These words were also on the belts of German

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:57.089
troops when they marched into Belgium in the year 1914 of Arkomenera. But they had it wrong.

00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:07.009
The sovereign Lord Jehovah was with us, not with them. He is with all of us now. He'll be with us

00:24:07.009 --> 00:24:13.490
during Armageddon. He'll be with us after Armageddon. He'll be with us at the end of the

00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:21.809
thousand-year reign of Christ. He'll be with mankind at the end of 100,000 years. He'll be with

00:24:21.809 --> 00:24:29.490
humans at the end of 100,000,000 years and at the end of 100,000,000 years times 100,000,000 years.

00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:38.529
Jehovah will be with mankind forever and so will Jesus. They are both on record as saying,

00:24:38.769 --> 00:24:48.609
I am with you. Thank you very much, Prussia Lush. Today, Jehovah's with these people

00:24:48.609 --> 00:24:55.250
everywhere. We're going to see examples of this next. First is the experience of Adam and Nancy

00:24:55.250 --> 00:25:01.970
Solomon. When they came into the truth, they faced better opposition from their families. Notice

00:25:02.049 --> 00:25:10.720
how Jehovah was with them during the stressful time. My family are Hungarian Jews.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:18.880
Most of them were killed in concentration camps. That's something that the Holocaust took for me.

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:27.359
They took the concept of family. I needed explanations. I needed to know why my family was murdered.

00:25:28.319 --> 00:25:35.759
It made me really search at a very young age to see if there was a real religion out there.

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:44.640
It was just a secular thing to be Jewish. It was a cultural thing. A friend of mine came up to me

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:52.799
and said, I have to tell you something. I got this book from one of Jehovah's Witnesses. It is

00:25:52.799 --> 00:26:00.400
the most beautiful book I have ever read. I said, I'll read it and it couldn't have been a week

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:07.920
later that I got a knock on my door. And there were two young women at the door who started to

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:16.480
talk to me about the Bible. Once I started having a study on a regular basis with Carolyn, I enjoyed

00:26:16.559 --> 00:26:24.319
it more and more. One day my father was home. He just screamed at them and basically threw them out of

00:26:24.319 --> 00:26:32.799
the house. It just progressed after that. There was just no peace at any time and lots of tears.

00:26:33.519 --> 00:26:40.000
And I just couldn't understand why they weren't even asking me, well, what is it that you like

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:46.960
about this religion? Who are these people? Let us talk to no, nothing. It was very, very hard.

00:26:48.319 --> 00:26:55.279
Shortly after my baptism, my mother came up to me and she said, your father and I are going out

00:26:55.279 --> 00:27:02.880
for the day. You better not be here when we get home. I was 17 years old. I didn't know where I was

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:08.720
going to go. I didn't know what I was going to do. But I trusted in Jehovah and I picked up the

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:15.279
phone and I called my Carolyn. In what seemed like minutes, there were brothers and sisters at the

00:27:15.279 --> 00:27:21.440
house. They were putting my things into this truck, bringing it over to Carolyn's house. And she said,

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:29.650
you can live with me. Before I was baptized, I would drive back and forth to school with a friend of

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:35.569
mine. Little by little, I was telling him what I was learning. He said, you know, I want to meet

00:27:36.049 --> 00:27:41.089
these people. I have some questions. I had questions. I asked them, why do we die, why do we grow old,

00:27:41.089 --> 00:27:47.329
so forth, and so on. And they went right to the Bible. And when I left the house after that,

00:27:48.529 --> 00:27:54.849
I said, this is the truth. Growing up in my house, going to church every Sunday was something that you

00:27:54.849 --> 00:28:00.849
had to do. But when I became a teenager, then religion became less in my life. And basketball

00:28:00.849 --> 00:28:05.970
became more. Being a young man, you watched sports and you see the sports players made a lot of

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:10.849
money. My teachers would tell my parents that he's going to be a good basketball player, take care

00:28:10.849 --> 00:28:15.569
of him. He could be worth, you know, several hundred thousand dollars by the time he graduates.

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:23.410
I received over 125 scholarships. Now you're talking about a free education just because you can

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:30.210
play basketball. So I realized, you know, in the early age that playing professional basketball

00:28:30.849 --> 00:28:37.410
could mean a lot, not only for me, but for my family. So as far as God was concerned, I had a little

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:43.250
interesting God. Like I would ask my mom questions, but it wasn't until Nancy brought me to the

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:50.049
witnesses that really something just kicked in. I was studying and my mom, she was downstairs in the

00:28:50.049 --> 00:28:54.690
basement. I heard her crying and said, what's wrong? And she said, I know you're going to become one

00:28:54.690 --> 00:29:00.609
of those Jehovah's Witnesses. So realizing in my mind that I'm not going to become a basketball

00:29:00.609 --> 00:29:05.890
player, I'm going to become one of Jehovah's Witnesses because that's more important. That affected me

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:12.529
many, many times. When others found out that I was going to become one of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:29:12.529 --> 00:29:17.730
people shied away. People tried to use you when they think you can give them something or you're

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:22.769
going to be somebody big to go to the direction of serving Jehovah completely. You lost all the

00:29:22.769 --> 00:29:30.289
worldly people that you thought were your friends. And so that was in one summer. I started the

00:29:30.289 --> 00:29:37.569
study with brother Crespo. And in six months, I was baptized. And then we decided to get married.

00:29:39.089 --> 00:29:44.609
The scripture that says that even if my own father and my mother would abandon me,

00:29:44.609 --> 00:29:53.009
that even Jehovah would take me in, it proved to be true in so many ways. Once you become one of

00:29:53.009 --> 00:29:58.769
Jehovah's Witnesses, you're part of a family that will do anything for you. We've had adversity

00:29:58.769 --> 00:30:03.890
over the years, but Jehovah never said everything is going to be perfect. What he said is when you

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:10.529
face these problems, you will not face them alone. And Jehovah has never let us down when it comes to

00:30:13.009 --> 00:30:19.970
when their families and friends abandoned them. Did you notice how Jehovah continued to be worth

00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:28.130
Adam and Nancy? This spiritual family immediately stepped in to support them. I appreciated what

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:36.210
Nancy said. Jehovah never said everything will be perfect. He said that when you face problems,

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:46.539
you will not face them alone. She and Adam never felt alone. Often we ask Jehovah to be with us

00:30:46.539 --> 00:30:53.980
when we need something, a spiritual need or a material need. But as we'll see in this next

00:30:53.980 --> 00:31:01.420
experience, even before we know that we have a need, Jehovah already knows what we need.

00:31:04.579 --> 00:31:11.940
In the name of my name is Rita. My son is Jackson and my daughter is Sharina. It's just a three of us.

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:20.500
I have been working in a tea estate as a tea picker. One day I prayed to God very hard. I said,

00:31:21.539 --> 00:31:28.420
please, help me to learn about the Bible. Within two days, Jehovah's Witnesses came and

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:34.980
knocked on my door and I agreed to study the Bible. I couldn't believe it. I only prayed yesterday

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:44.019
asking God to help me to study the Bible. Our meetings began at 4.45. But we have to get ready by

00:31:44.019 --> 00:31:53.900
12 o'clock to attend the meetings. So we prepare our bags on Wednesday night. I carried two big bags

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:58.940
on my shoulders and walked for three and a half kilometers to get to the meetings on time.

00:32:01.759 --> 00:32:14.619
We love seeing our brothers. That's why we always go to the meetings early. I have been pioneering

00:32:14.619 --> 00:32:24.900
now for a year and six months. There is no greater happiness than what comes from pioneering.

00:32:27.779 --> 00:32:34.500
This is a one-time opportunity. That is why we decided that we should give the best that we can

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:46.589
to Jehovah. Now I'm so happy to be serving this way. One time, I was not paid at all.

00:32:49.329 --> 00:33:01.789
I didn't even have a rupee. On that day, my children and I ate well. But after eating,

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:07.869
we were very worried about what we were going to do the following day. So that night,

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:17.549
I said a prayer with the kids and we read the Bible. Jesus said,

00:33:18.349 --> 00:33:25.470
don't worry about tomorrow. So I trusted that somehow Jehovah would give us what we needed.

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:35.950
It was 10.30 at night. I was fast asleep and the phone rang. Usually no one calls this late.

00:33:37.069 --> 00:33:46.319
So I wondered who could be calling me this late. I picked up the phone and it was a brother on the line.

00:33:47.279 --> 00:33:53.200
He said, sister, go to your bookshelf and take the greatest man book.

00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:04.740
Then he asked me to turn to a page. When I turned to that page, there was 10,000 rupees

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:11.300
between those pages. We could not believe our eyes. It was exactly what we needed for that month's

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:17.460
expenses. A few days earlier, he and his wife had visited us and secretly left the money in the book

00:34:17.539 --> 00:34:24.420
before leaving. So I thanked Jehovah in prayer with the kids. Jehovah already knows exactly what we

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:42.400
needed even before we realized it. Honestly, every night I opened the doors, go outside and look

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:50.079
up at the night sky. When I look up, I see many stars. I clearly meditate about his wisdom,

00:34:50.960 --> 00:35:02.619
his power, what amazing things he is able to do. This earth, this universe, how amazingly well he cares

00:35:02.619 --> 00:35:13.260
for them. He takes care of the smallest thing. I completely rely on Jehovah and then I remember

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:23.019
that Jehovah has the ability to help us with this Holy Spirit. He is such a loving father.

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:34.460
He is always holding our hand tight and no one can separate us from him. If anyone tries,

00:35:35.179 --> 00:35:43.789
they would feel he is so generous with his love. He is so affectionate with us.

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:48.829
No one can take away the love Jehovah has for us.

00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:57.539
Did you notice from Reader's experience that Jehovah is with us in several ways?

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:04.579
Reader really appreciates congregation meetings. They love being with their brothers.

00:36:05.219 --> 00:36:11.460
How about you? Do you value the meetings and the encouraging association you find there?

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:20.500
Reader takes time to meditate on the wonders of creation. And she does more than marvel at what

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:28.260
she sees. She notices how Jehovah's love and care for her is evident in all these works.

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:36.739
She knows that Jehovah has the power to create anything, and he wants to use his power in her behalf.

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:46.579
It's no surprise that Reader is keenly aware of Jehovah's constant support in her pioneer ministry.

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:55.179
Jehovah proves to be with us in the ministry, whether we're preaching in our local community

00:36:55.179 --> 00:37:02.300
or sharing in a special campaign. Let's go to Europe and watch your report about a special campaign.

00:37:03.179 --> 00:37:11.099
As with Reader's experience, see if you can identify how Jehovah was with the many thousands

00:37:11.099 --> 00:37:19.630
who volunteered for this campaign. In the central Europe branch territory, a special campaign

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:25.630
was organized. Actually the School for Branch Committee members triggered an evaluation

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:33.150
how much territory in the countries we oversee is not really covered thoroughly. So we asked our

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:40.349
circuit overseers to recommend us which sections of the congregation's territory could be listed as

00:37:40.349 --> 00:37:47.949
so-called unassigned territory. All in all we received over 11,000 territories from the

00:37:47.949 --> 00:37:54.190
congregations with approximately 3 million inhabitants. So because of this grand scale,

00:37:54.190 --> 00:38:00.670
there was suddenly the idea why not organizing a special preaching campaign to cover all these

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:07.789
territories on one single weekend. This was really exciting. And after getting the branch

00:38:07.789 --> 00:38:13.630
committee's approval, the service department started to organize it. To be honest, at first,

00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:17.710
we were not really sure how the publishers would react to such a campaign.

00:38:18.429 --> 00:38:24.909
But we fully trusted in Jehovah and the response was stunning. Over 20,000 publishers

00:38:24.909 --> 00:38:28.989
participated and were assigned to all these territories throughout Germany.

00:38:30.269 --> 00:38:36.110
The campaign took place on one weekend in May 2017 and was especially successful in

00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:46.659
metropolitan areas, as in Berlin, Hamburg, or Düsseldorf. But I know how it's to come.

00:38:46.659 --> 00:38:52.820
At one door, Amanda just arrived. He wanted to open his shop where he sells Arabian specialties.

00:38:53.619 --> 00:38:58.739
We were able to show him a video in Arabic. Then he gave us his address and phone number.

00:38:59.619 --> 00:39:05.940
He also agreed to have someone visit him again. Yes, it's really a privilege to join in such a

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:10.739
campaign and to see that every human is precious to Jehovah, no matter where they live or where they

00:39:10.739 --> 00:39:18.500
come from. Because of the need and the fantastic response in 2017, it was decided to repeat such a

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:26.739
campaign in May 2018. And this time it was expanded to Switzerland, Austria, Luxembourg and

00:39:26.739 --> 00:39:36.900
Lichtenstein. And now imagine over 32,000 publishers participated, which is actually over 60% more

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:44.579
than in May 2017. This was really faith strengthening and again, a lot of wonderful experiences

00:39:44.579 --> 00:39:50.980
very parted. It's incredible. No matter where you are in Berlin, you can see small groups of

00:39:51.059 --> 00:39:56.500
brothers everywhere. That was really great. In the ministry, we met a woman and she told us that she

00:39:56.500 --> 00:40:02.179
had just prayed for a Bible study. We are now more than ever convinced that Jehovah leads all this

00:40:02.179 --> 00:40:10.340
work through his angels. Today's Sunday, we had a nice experience. A woman called us from behind.

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:16.500
She had actually already passed us, but she had a feeling she had to go back again. She told us

00:40:16.739 --> 00:40:25.730
later. After she had invited us to her home, we exchanged our contact information and could

00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:33.329
also fill in their online contact form. Had we been in the territory just one minute later,

00:40:33.329 --> 00:40:38.050
we would never have made the contact. This must have been guided by the angels.

00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:44.610
Yesterday morning, while in the ministry, a young man ran after us and asked us what we were doing.

00:40:44.610 --> 00:40:49.409
We explained it to him. He asked us why there is still so much evil in the world then.

00:40:49.409 --> 00:40:53.969
In the afternoon, we were able to call on him again. We could start a Bible study right away

00:40:53.969 --> 00:41:01.489
and arrange a return visit which we will make today. Being together with friends is just so great.

00:41:01.489 --> 00:41:06.690
You're out and about with a large group. You meet up again regularly to change partners

00:41:06.769 --> 00:41:15.730
and to relate experiences is just great. Thousands of videos were shown and a lot of Bible studies

00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:22.210
were started. And what is very interesting, a lot of publishers felt motivated to expand the ministry

00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:27.969
after the campaign. For sure, these preaching campaigns truly prove that Jehovah and Jesus are

00:41:27.969 --> 00:41:33.570
directing the preaching work and the angels are helping us in reaching out to all people.

00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:49.150
We really have a lot of reasons to be Jehovah's happy people. Jehovah truly proved to be with

00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:55.789
all who volunteered to share in this campaign. Hell else could the good news reach three million

00:41:55.789 --> 00:42:04.269
people in such a well-organized way. We'd like to thank the more than 32,000 brothers and sisters

00:42:04.349 --> 00:42:12.670
who shared in their special work. As Brother Luci noted in his talk, Jehovah is with us in the

00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:20.269
ministry. There is no doubt he is directing the global preaching work through Jesus and His angels.

00:42:21.469 --> 00:42:26.670
Did you notice how many people were contacted soon after they prayed for a Bible study

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:30.349
or for a question to be answered? Isn't that interesting?

00:42:30.829 --> 00:42:39.389
When we're together with a large group of Jehovah's people in the ministry and at our meetings and

00:42:39.389 --> 00:42:46.429
assemblies, we really feel Jehovah's blessing, don't we? But what if we're isolated?

00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:54.110
What if we're facing persecution? This is what Alphan's talk like spear in some years ago in Egypt.

00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:57.710
Let's see how Jehovah proved to be with him.

00:43:31.539 --> 00:43:37.619
What's going on there? What does this place look like? Where is it?

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:52.780
The officers get two soldiers to escort us to our cell where the brothers were.

00:43:53.900 --> 00:44:01.179
We know that when people taken to the concentration camp, they spend his and some of them never

00:44:01.179 --> 00:44:16.050
send back. When I was in a teenager, I liked the characters in the bar, like Abraham, Daniel, Moses.

00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:22.929
I thought they're champions of the true worship. As some say, I felt jealous of them.

00:44:23.650 --> 00:44:31.809
They got this huge relationship with God. So I'd like to be part of that. I'll continue to

00:44:32.449 --> 00:44:39.170
the barber to get closer to God. I know he says you have a look after him. He will not abandon his seven.

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:47.730
So we try to encourage them, brothers, keep in mind that we hear because we worship Jehovah.

00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:55.809
We set together to discuss what we're going to do to keep on as peaceful as strong. We thought

00:44:56.289 --> 00:45:04.130
we need to pray. If we pick up a scripture every day, like a daily text, and then after that

00:45:04.769 --> 00:45:13.010
result, a scripture, one will handle a talk from the memory of God and then an open discussion of

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:25.059
Bible question. At that stage, we didn't have Bible with us. The officers want to ask to renown our

00:45:25.059 --> 00:45:32.260
face. So they told me to lay on the ground and they started to beat me.

00:45:33.699 --> 00:45:37.460
The whole camp was around and one of the prisoners fainted.

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:44.500
Power started to pray to Jehovah. Jehovah helped me to be able to induce it. It was very severe

00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:51.539
pain and I felt his help because after a few beating my body fell numb. I don't feel much more

00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:58.980
pain. One of the prisoners said to me, if I get out of here alive, I will tell my children

00:45:59.619 --> 00:46:07.219
that in the concentration camp, I've seen the Christian, remind me with the first century Christian

00:46:07.219 --> 00:46:15.139
that they were happy even to die without renowning their face. One of the officers, this,

00:46:15.139 --> 00:46:21.059
you know, a nice one that used to beat us very, very severely, came one day and he said,

00:46:21.539 --> 00:46:26.579
we need two of you to come out and write a report about what do you believe.

00:46:27.539 --> 00:46:32.980
So we thought about, is it wise to do that or maybe they use it against us? You know,

00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:37.059
pray to Jehovah for help to make a decision. He to guide us what to do.

00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:45.219
Same the end we reached a point that, well, we may get out, may not. So might as well give them a witness.

00:46:45.219 --> 00:46:54.820
I told the officer, we need a Bible. He said, what for? I said to him because we need to

00:46:55.699 --> 00:47:03.139
court from the Bible in this report. So he said, okay, you have a Bible in the soul. He said, yes,

00:47:03.139 --> 00:47:13.739
I have a Bible. He said, okay, go and get your Bible. I want to my bag and picked up the Bible.

00:47:22.929 --> 00:47:26.610
So I picked up the Bible of my hand, opened it, ran them, they are in such a rain.

00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:34.690
Numbers, they looked at me, who wrote this book? I said to him, Moses. He said, you are a liar!

00:47:34.690 --> 00:47:43.650
On the top of his voice. So I kept quiet and he closed the book again and opened it again.

00:47:44.610 --> 00:47:47.170
At the same time, what kind of a lie is that?

00:47:49.329 --> 00:47:55.889
You are a liar again on top of his head. I was racing in my mind where it is written and the

00:47:55.889 --> 00:48:02.849
poverty that Jehovah told Moses to write any of these. He shot the book again for a fair

00:48:02.849 --> 00:48:05.969
time and opened it again and he started reading the Lord's books.

00:48:06.769 --> 00:48:17.780
So the officer looked at me with a big surprise in his face.

00:48:22.050 --> 00:48:29.010
After we wrote the report, so I asked him, can we keep the Bible in place? He said, okay, keep the

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:36.849
Bible. So three months near the every day, the officer comes in and beat us and expects us to

00:48:36.929 --> 00:48:44.050
compromise. We never did that. All I can say is Jehovah's hand. Jehovah's helping us to

00:48:44.050 --> 00:48:50.849
endure, to continue to do his will, not compromising because we belong to him and we rhyme him.

00:48:56.130 --> 00:49:06.639
God will not abandon his seven. Why was Alphonse thrown into prison? It wasn't because he refused

00:49:06.639 --> 00:49:13.280
to say a simple greeting to the president of his country. No, that phrase was a political slogan.

00:49:14.079 --> 00:49:19.440
Like many Jehovah's witnesses, Alphonse was persecuted for his neutrality.

00:49:20.719 --> 00:49:27.440
What helped Alphonse to be loyal? He prayed. He prayed to maintain a strong spiritual routine.

00:49:28.159 --> 00:49:34.400
He prayed when he had to make a decision and he prayed for help to endure brutal treatment.

00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:44.000
Like Alphonse, do you depend on the power of prayer? Alphonse and earlier Rita

00:49:44.719 --> 00:49:53.599
likened their relationship with Jehovah to holding his hand. Rita said, Jehovah holds our hand tight.

00:49:54.480 --> 00:50:03.519
Alphonse said, all I can say, it is Jehovah's hand. What a beautiful image. That's how close we

00:50:03.519 --> 00:50:13.840
can be to Jehovah. This month's music video reminds us of that. Jehovah's always willing to

00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:19.920
hold our hand. It's entitled Jehovah's always by our side.

00:51:02.019 --> 00:52:48.610
Jehovah's always by our side. He'll take my earth as a sack. He'll give you to face it all.

00:52:49.489 --> 00:54:49.230
What a beautiful soul. For many months on JW Broadcasting, we've enjoyed a series of video dramatizations

00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:57.469
about applying Bible principles in our lives. We have learned that we can enjoy happier lives today

00:54:58.110 --> 00:55:04.110
and live in a way that pleases God when we apply Jehovah's principles and standards.

00:55:05.070 --> 00:55:12.110
Applying God's principles also gives us a wonderful hope. As our concluding video in this

00:55:12.110 --> 00:55:20.750
series shows, focusing on our future hope helps us to build a faith to withstand trials with face

00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:38.690
today. See if you remember these scenes. Getting baptized was the most important decision I

00:55:38.690 --> 00:55:45.489
ever made, but it took some time to realize that was just a start of my Christian life. Sometimes

00:55:45.489 --> 00:55:50.769
it was hard to show courage. Why don't you people get involved and make a real difference for once?

00:55:57.730 --> 00:56:03.090
And it was hard for my son too. No thanks. So much Jehovah's witness and I don't celebrate for this.

00:56:06.610 --> 00:56:14.130
I really liked Lucas and he was very sick. I really wanted to sign his birthday card,

00:56:14.929 --> 00:56:22.179
but that helped me to see how Jehovah felt about it and that helped me to be brave.

00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:27.059
My students are in the card, but I'm going to do something else really this.

00:56:35.679 --> 00:56:42.159
My parents had always set a good example for me, but after I moved to serve where the need was

00:56:42.159 --> 00:56:49.679
greater, it seemed like my parents were growing apart. Are you both doing okay? Because you don't

00:56:49.679 --> 00:56:54.559
look okay. Of course, we are okay. We're doing wonderful, right? Yeah, we're doing good.

00:56:55.039 --> 00:57:03.119
I was really worried. Later, they told me what helped them. I was their love for Jehovah.

00:57:04.159 --> 00:57:11.360
They meditated on the example of Abraham and Sarah, who showed honor to each other by listening

00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:18.880
and by caring. That example really helped my parents. And since then, I've seen how it can

00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:29.090
help in any relationship. I'm a long way from home, but showing love to others, it helps me to

00:57:29.090 --> 00:57:39.809
stay happy in my assignment. Now, Dr. Tolders, that our baby would likely be born with

00:57:40.610 --> 00:57:50.980
severe problems and could even die. It was more than I could bear. And because my husband was not

00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:59.219
one of Jehovah's Witnesses, I needed God's help more than ever to calm my heart and help me explain

00:57:59.219 --> 00:58:07.099
why I could never have an abortion. And even though it took me years before I would agree to a

00:58:07.099 --> 00:58:15.969
Bible study, and even more years before I made enough changes to qualify for baptism, the life we

00:58:15.969 --> 00:58:25.090
have now, serving Jehovah together. Nothing could make me happier. Nothing could make us happier.

00:58:27.599 --> 00:58:34.719
Happiness really does come from serving Jehovah, but serving him faithfully definitely takes courage.

00:58:36.239 --> 00:58:43.840
It was so hard for me to turn down that girl at school, and I felt so guilty for how involved I'd

00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:52.530
gotten with her. My uncle used the Bible to help me get back on track, and to remind me of two other

00:58:52.530 --> 00:59:02.530
very important things that Jehovah was proud of me and that I was not alone. James 1, 2 and 3 says,

00:59:03.250 --> 00:59:10.210
consider it all joy my brothers when you meet with various trials, knowing as you do that this

00:59:10.210 --> 00:59:19.170
tested quality of your faith produces endurance. I think about that scripture a lot, because soon

00:59:19.170 --> 00:59:25.969
I'll probably be sent to prison for refusing military service. Being courageous with that

00:59:25.969 --> 00:59:33.250
classmate helped me build the faith and courage that I need now. I can give up anything for Jehovah.

00:59:34.210 --> 00:59:40.530
I might live in a small cell for now, but in paradise I'm going to travel everywhere.

00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:49.019
Sometimes I get lonely, but that's okay. It's a choice that I've made to stay in my assignment right

00:59:49.019 --> 00:59:56.480
now. In the future, if I choose to get married, I hope to have a marriage like my parents.

00:59:58.989 --> 01:00:04.909
I really hope that Lucas is resurrected so I can show him around paradise and teach him more about

01:00:04.909 --> 01:00:15.789
Jehovah. I showed him pictures, but the real thing will be so much better. Then I can hold my baby

01:00:15.789 --> 01:00:28.130
girl again. Our program has focused on the many ways that Jehovah is with us. He's with us as we

01:00:28.130 --> 01:00:37.489
worked towards dedication and baptism. He's with us at our congregation meetings, and when we are

01:00:37.489 --> 01:00:45.489
with our spiritual family, he's with us as we successfully face persecution and hardship.

01:00:46.929 --> 01:00:53.090
And Jehovah is with us when we share the good news of his kingdom with everyone we meet.

01:00:54.449 --> 01:01:00.530
And Brother Maray, I appreciate that you were here with me for this month's program.

01:01:00.929 --> 01:01:07.409
Thank you, Brother Losh. We end this month's program with a visit to our brothers and sisters

01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:16.050
in Tenerife. Tenerife is the largest of the Canary Islands, an archipelago off the northwest coast of

01:01:16.050 --> 01:01:26.769
Africa. These islands were formed by volcanic eruptions. The highest point is the Dormantede volcano

01:01:26.769 --> 01:01:36.130
on Tenerife. Here the weather is mild and sunny throughout the year. This is made to Canary

01:01:36.210 --> 01:01:45.869
Islands famous for their extensive banana plantations. Tenerife is a popular tourist destination.

01:01:46.590 --> 01:01:54.510
It's home to nearly a million people, but more than 10 million visitors come every year to enjoy

01:01:54.510 --> 01:02:04.590
the beaches, the lush terrain, and the food. The island of Tenerife has 33 congregations,

01:02:05.309 --> 01:02:13.630
and more than 3,000 publishers. 492 of whom are regular pioneers.

01:02:14.989 --> 01:02:20.989
Because of the influx of visitors from all over the world, our brothers and sisters preach

01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:39.280
over 15 languages, including Russian, German, French, Hindi, and Romanian. They preach

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:45.119
everywhere in the cities, as well as the rural and mountainous regions.

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:53.760
Our brothers and sisters in Tenerife send you their warm, Christian love and greetings.

01:02:54.960 --> 01:03:01.679
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.
