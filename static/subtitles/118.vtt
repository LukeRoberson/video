00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:09.099
In this month's program, we'll learn how Jehovah is there for us when life feels unfair.

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:17.100
In a new episode of Immitate Their Faith, we'll see how Miriam accepted discipline with humility.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.100
How did two teens promote real change when they were surrounded by injustice?

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.100
We'll see in our next installment of Reasons for Faith.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:35.100
Our music video will show how Jehovah empowers us when we feel overwhelmed.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.100
Welcome to JW Broadcasting.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:01:01.049
Do you ever feel disadvantaged?

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:07.049
Do you feel that perhaps because of unfavorable circumstances over which you have no control,

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.049
you just don't have a fair chance in life?

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:16.049
Maybe you feel that in the race of life, others seem to be able to run freely.

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.049
But you have to run with a crutch.

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:26.049
In this program, we're going to talk about a very endearing aspect of Jehovah's personality,

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.049
his loving care for the disadvantaged.

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:39.049
We'll delve into his feelings for such ones, his respect for them, and his long history of caring for them.

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:45.049
We'll also consider how Jehovah's care of the lowly ones draws us closer to him

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:51.049
and how it can reassure you if you face disadvantages in your life.

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:56.049
To begin with, who are the disadvantaged?

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:03.049
When we speak of disadvantaged ones in this discussion, we're not talking about the inadequacies of the person,

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:09.050
but rather of the unfortunate circumstances in life that one must contend with,

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.050
often a person inherits the situation through no fault of his own.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:22.050
Among such ones, the Bible specifically mentions widows, orphans, and foreign residents.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.050
Notice this at Deuteronomy 24-17.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:32.050
You must not pervert the judgment of the foreign resident or of the fatherless child,

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:38.050
and you must not seize the garment of a widow as security for a loan.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.050
The watchtower said,

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:50.050
the law specifically protected those who could not protect themselves, such as orphans, widows, and foreign residents.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:56.050
Psalm 1014 refers to such ones as unfortunate victims,

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:04.050
and the Bible also uses the term lowly ones, not because they're less important, but because of their circumstances.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:12.620
Our next main question is, how does Jehovah feel about such ones?

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:20.620
We really see a beautiful aspect of Jehovah's personality here, his compassion and empathy in action.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.620
Since a widow doesn't have a husband to care for her,

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.620
and orphan doesn't have parents to provide for and protect him,

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:36.620
and a foreigner has no advocate, Jehovah steps in and fills those roles personally.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.620
Notice this in the wording of Psalm 68 in verse 5,

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:49.620
a father of the fatherless, and a protector of widows is God in his holy dwelling.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.620
Jehovah himself assumes the responsibility left vacated.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.620
He becomes the father. He becomes the protector.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:09.620
As their protector, note how he views their care at Exodus 22, 22 through 24.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.620
You must not afflict any widow or fatherless child.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.620
If you afflict him at all so that he cries out to me,

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.620
I will unfailingly hear his outcry, and my anger will blaze,

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.620
and I will kill you with the sword, and your wives will become widows,

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.620
and your children will be fatherless.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.620
Regarding this verse, the watchtower said,

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:42.620
notice that Jehovah did not leave it up to the human judges in Israel to enforce this law.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:49.620
God himself would execute judgment upon anyone who took advantage of a defenseless child.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:56.620
This is how personally, Jehovah takes the care of the lowly disadvantaged ones.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.620
They become his responsibility. They come under his protection.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.620
Jehovah personally makes up for any disadvantage they may have.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:17.379
The fact that Jehovah takes personal responsibility for such ones is further seen in Proverbs 1917.

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:23.379
The one showing favor to the lowly is lending to Jehovah,

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:27.379
and he will repay him for what he does.

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:31.379
Let's walk through the process that this verse describes.

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:37.379
First, we assist the lowly, or we show favor to them in some way.

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:40.379
We help them in a practical way. We encourage them.

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:45.379
We make sure they get justice, or care for something else they're in need of.

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:52.379
Well, as discussed, Jehovah has assumed the responsibility to care for these disadvantaged ones.

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:59.379
So when we step in and assist, Jehovah views this as if we are giving to him,

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:03.379
assisting him with his responsibility.

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:09.379
But Jehovah doesn't view it as a gift or payment, but as a loan.

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:13.379
What's the difference between a gift and a loan?

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:17.379
A loan must be repaid.

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:27.379
Imagine, when we assist the disadvantaged, Jehovah actually views himself as indebted to us lowly humans.

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:33.379
Jehovah will repay that debt with favor and blessings.

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:41.819
Without a doubt, Jehovah feels strongly about the care of disadvantaged ones.

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:44.819
Let's consider this a little further.

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:48.819
Because of Jehovah's love and compassion for the disadvantaged,

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:52.819
he enacted laws to protect them in Israel.

00:06:52.819 --> 00:07:00.819
In these laws, we see the depth of Jehovah's understanding and his tender care and protection of such ones.

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:03.819
Consider just two examples.

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:08.819
First, let's look at his law regarding a security for a loan.

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:12.819
We find this at Exodus 22, 26, and 27.

00:07:12.819 --> 00:07:19.480
If you seize the garment of your fellow man as security for a loan,

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.480
you are to return it to him by sunset.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:29.480
For it is his only covering, his clothing to cover his body, in what will he lie down to sleep.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:36.480
When he cries out to me, I will certainly hear, for I am compassionate.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:42.480
There's compassion in this law for any poor Israelite who might find himself in this situation.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:51.480
However, note the additional stipulation made in the case of widows as stated at Deuteronomy 24-17.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:58.459
You must not pervert the judgment of the foreign resident or of the fatherless child,

00:07:58.459 --> 00:08:05.459
and you must not seize the garment of a widow as security for a loan.

00:08:05.459 --> 00:08:11.459
In the widow's case, no Israelite was to take her garment as security at all.

00:08:11.459 --> 00:08:20.459
Jehovah evidently wanted to eliminate any chance that she be left overnight without her garment to keep her war.

00:08:20.459 --> 00:08:23.459
Isn't that beautiful?

00:08:23.459 --> 00:08:29.459
Don't we see Jehovah's special love and care for disadvantaged ones and a law like this?

00:08:29.459 --> 00:08:35.899
Here's a second example of a law made to help the lolly ones.

00:08:35.899 --> 00:08:43.899
In this case, it was related to the sacrifices the Israelites were to make to Jehovah for the forgiveness of their sins.

00:08:43.899 --> 00:08:49.899
We know the importance of blood in regard to sacrifices to atone ones from sin.

00:08:49.899 --> 00:08:56.899
Leviticus 17-11 tells us that it is the blood that makes atonement.

00:08:56.899 --> 00:09:05.759
However, note the provision made for the very poor in Israel found that Leviticus 5-11.

00:09:05.759 --> 00:09:10.759
Now if he cannot afford two turtle doves or two young pigeons,

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:18.759
he must bring as his offering for his sin a tenth of an effa of fine flour for sin offering.

00:09:18.759 --> 00:09:22.759
Regarding this, the watchtower said,

00:09:22.759 --> 00:09:29.759
for the very poor, Jehovah chose to make an exception and allow a sin offering without blood.

00:09:29.759 --> 00:09:36.759
In Israel, poverty denied no one the blessing of atonement or the privilege of making peace with God.

00:09:36.759 --> 00:09:38.759
The watchtower continued,

00:09:38.759 --> 00:09:42.759
does that mean that the flour offerings of the poor were worthless?

00:09:42.759 --> 00:09:49.759
No. Jehovah surely valued the humble willing spirit behind such offerings.

00:09:49.759 --> 00:09:56.759
Furthermore, the sins of the entire nation, including the poor, were covered by the blood of the animals,

00:09:56.759 --> 00:10:00.759
offered to God on the annual day of atonement.

00:10:00.759 --> 00:10:08.759
In this, we see Jehovah's reasonableness, his compassion, and his love for the disadvantaged.

00:10:08.759 --> 00:10:18.840
No one was left out, and they received the same refreshment from their sacrifice as any other Israelite.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:26.840
So far in our discussion, we've highlighted that Jehovah takes personal responsibility for the care of disadvantaged ones.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.840
He steps in and fills the vacated role.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:36.840
And when we assist such ones, he views it as lending to him.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:44.840
Further, we see his love and compassion in the laws he enacted to protect such ones in Israel.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.840
Here's an important question.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:54.840
When you think about the special place Jehovah has in his heart for disadvantaged ones,

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.840
how does that make you feel about him?

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.840
Doesn't it draw you closer to Jehovah?

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:07.090
We can't help but love him for it.

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:15.090
Jehovah's love and care for the disadvantaged is in such stark contrast to the way such ones are often treated in the world.

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:24.090
Sadly, the world often steps on the disadvantaged, taking more advantage of them because they can.

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:28.090
Further, whom does the world praise and promote?

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:35.090
Isn't it typically the beautiful, the rich, the talented, the funny, the charismatic?

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:43.090
Whereas the common person, even more so, the disadvantaged often doesn't receive such favor.

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:50.590
By contrast, Jehovah is on the lookout for the lowly ones.

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:52.590
This brings us to our next question.

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:58.590
How is this reassuring for those of us who are disadvantaged in one way or another?

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:04.590
At the outset, we ask that question, do you feel disadvantaged?

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:07.590
What are your circumstances?

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:14.590
Maybe because of your situation, you relate to the widow, the orphan, or the foreign resident in Israel.

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:21.590
And while the mosaic law specifically mentioned those three, we could broaden those groups today, couldn't we?

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:29.590
For example, we certainly have widows in our midst today, and our hearts truly go out to these dear ones.

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:40.590
But couldn't we also include in this group, wives who are neglected or abused by their husbands, verbally, emotionally, or physically?

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:45.590
Such ones don't have the normal protection expected of a husband.

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:54.590
Couldn't we also include single parents, either because of the death of a mate or because of divorce or abandonment?

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:59.590
Along with orphans, couldn't we include children of single parents?

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:03.590
Children of parents addicted to alcohol or drugs?

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:10.590
Or children of parents suffering from severe depression or other debilitating mental illness?

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:16.590
These are cases that children may not be getting the normal care and training that's due to them.

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:19.590
And what about foreigners?

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:25.590
These are disadvantaged because they have no advocate, no legal recourse for protection.

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:34.590
Couldn't we also include in this group, ones who are minorities in the land where they live, and so are often discriminated against?

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:44.590
Really, we could include any who do not have the normal protection do them, or just don't have the same opportunities as others.

00:13:44.590 --> 00:14:02.590
Any who feel disadvantaged, such as the impoverished, the disabled, those with a lack of education or training, those who, because of unfavorable circumstances in their youth, didn't get a fair chance, and the list could go on.

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:06.590
What makes you feel disadvantaged?

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:14.590
Well, all of Jehovah's loving tender care for the lowly ones who we discussed earlier applies to you.

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:23.590
Jehovah feels just as strongly about your situation as he did for the widow and orphan and foreign resident in Israel.

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:30.590
He takes personal responsibility for your care and protection.

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:35.590
Note what the Bible says about him at Isaiah 57-15.

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:42.590
For this is what the high and lofty one says, who lives forever and whose name is holy.

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:57.590
I reside in the high and holy place, but also with those crushed and lowly in spirit to revive the spirit of the lowly and to revive the heart of those being crushed.

00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:01.590
Here, Jehovah says that he resides with the lowly ones.

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:05.590
That means that he doesn't just see your situation from afar.

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:08.590
He doesn't just come and go quickly.

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:14.590
Note this gives the sense that he sits down, he gets comfortable, and stays with you.

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:18.590
And for what purpose does he remain close to you?

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:22.590
To revive your spirit and your heart.

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:26.590
He has open concern for your welfare.

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:33.940
Have you personally experienced Jehovah's loving help in your situation?

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:41.940
Of course, living during the time that we do, we know that we can't expect Jehovah to shield us from every hardship that comes our way.

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:45.940
But have you seen him help you endure?

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:49.940
Have you experienced him provide for you?

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:54.940
Have you seen him answer a prayer at just the right time?

00:15:54.940 --> 00:16:03.940
Have you come across a scripture or article from the publications that gave you just what you needed when you needed it?

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:12.940
Have you seen Jehovah's care through a thoughtful word or timely practical help from one of your brothers or sisters in the congregation?

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:16.940
That is Jehovah residing with you.

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:18.940
You are not alone.

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:21.940
Jehovah is reviving your heart.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:25.940
He has assumed responsibility for your care.

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.940
He takes it personally.

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:32.940
You are important to him.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:35.940
And we just love him for it, don't we?

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:43.340
Well, there's something else that Jehovah does to help the disadvantaged.

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:46.340
He gives you hope.

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:50.340
You will not be downtrodden forever.

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:58.340
Jehovah's care for the disadvantaged will be fully expressed in a new world when all disadvantages will be removed.

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:03.340
Psalm 145 verse 16 says,

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:09.339
You open your hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing.

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:17.339
Not just the prominent, not just the favored, but Jehovah will satisfy the desire of every living thing.

00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:21.339
That includes you.

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:23.339
The watchtower said,

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:34.339
The fulfillment of Jehovah's promises will be so impressive that the difficulties and trials of the present time will pale into insignificance.

00:17:34.339 --> 00:17:40.339
In the coming paradise, the blessings from Jehovah will surpass our imagination.

00:17:40.339 --> 00:17:45.339
And we will certainly experience unprecedented happiness.

00:17:45.339 --> 00:17:49.339
Nothing will be missing in paradise.

00:17:49.339 --> 00:17:52.339
Nothing will be unfair.

00:17:52.339 --> 00:17:57.339
Every person will have every advantage.

00:17:57.339 --> 00:18:05.099
Praise be Jehovah God, the protector of the disadvantaged ones.

00:18:05.099 --> 00:18:09.099
We hope that this discussion has reassured you.

00:18:09.099 --> 00:18:12.099
Reminded you of Jehovah's tender care.

00:18:12.099 --> 00:18:16.099
And given you confidence that Jehovah will always be there for you.

00:18:16.099 --> 00:18:21.099
He will always protect you whatever your disadvantage may be.

00:18:21.099 --> 00:18:32.559
And in the end, Jehovah has reserved a beautiful future for all those seeking refuge in him.

00:18:32.559 --> 00:18:40.559
When Jehovah cared for the widows of the past, and today he's with his servants who experience a devastating loss.

00:18:40.559 --> 00:18:47.559
Let's see how Jehovah has been there for court, a widower, as he deals with the pain of losing his wife.

00:18:48.559 --> 00:19:04.630
I remember I had been able to experience many blessings from Jehovah.

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:11.250
I was able to go on different assignments.

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:14.250
Paraguay, Nigeria, Zambia.

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:19.250
And then we packed up all of our belongings from home.

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:26.250
Took up everything in our life and drove across the United States from California to Patterson.

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:31.250
And within a couple of months, she was diagnosed with ALS.

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:38.180
We were crushed.

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:44.180
Dropped back to California, and there we just tried to do everything we can to help her.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:46.180
Nothing worked and she passed away.

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:50.180
And so it was extremely difficult.

00:19:50.180 --> 00:20:06.579
She was my best friend.

00:20:06.579 --> 00:20:12.579
I received an encouraging card from my sister just helping me to try and keep moving forward.

00:20:12.579 --> 00:20:18.579
And one of the thoughts in there was this particular scripture in Psalm 18 verse 29.

00:20:19.579 --> 00:20:22.579
By God's power, I can scale a wall.

00:20:22.579 --> 00:20:24.579
And sometimes our trials feel just like that.

00:20:24.579 --> 00:20:26.579
They feel something that you just can't get over.

00:20:26.579 --> 00:20:36.779
And it's impossible to climb a wall and there's nothing to grab onto.

00:20:36.779 --> 00:20:39.779
The trial may feel this way to us.

00:20:39.779 --> 00:20:49.609
But again, the scripture says that by God's power, I can scale this wall.

00:20:49.609 --> 00:20:58.609
So sticking with the goal of pioneering helped me to get moving and then help me to also want to try and reach out for other goals,

00:20:58.609 --> 00:21:05.009
which is going back to do temple work at Bethel.

00:21:05.009 --> 00:21:14.299
It's a privilege to be able to go to Bethel and every day you're working for Jehovah.

00:21:14.299 --> 00:21:16.299
It was nice to be able to be with the friends.

00:21:16.299 --> 00:21:18.299
They were always so very, very encouraging.

00:21:18.299 --> 00:21:25.299
And I know that working with them and working on a Theocratic project helped them motivate me to keep moving.

00:21:25.299 --> 00:21:27.299
To feel more positive.

00:21:27.299 --> 00:21:35.079
It serves an elder in the congregation, so it's still trying to do my assignments.

00:21:35.079 --> 00:21:38.079
To try and be on shepherding visits.

00:21:38.079 --> 00:21:43.079
It's been something to keep my mind not on myself, but on trying to help others.

00:21:43.079 --> 00:21:50.480
It's always encouraging to be out in the ministry and to be with the friends.

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:56.480
And they have different levels of anxieties and problems, health issues, and other things that they deal with.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:03.480
When you talk to them and they encourage you, it's an interchange of encouragement to be out in the ministry with the friends.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:09.480
Miriam and I always had a regular habit of personal study.

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:11.480
We did it together.

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:16.480
We left to bounce ideas off of each other and we would share points that we had dug up.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:25.890
Now, even more so for myself, I feel it's important because it helps me to keep motivated, to help me to keep finding those points.

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:29.890
And also, it's a good memories of something that we did together that we enjoyed.

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:42.279
So I stick to my spiritual routine, but I also have a physical routine.

00:22:42.279 --> 00:22:48.769
I'll mountain bike three or four times a week.

00:22:48.769 --> 00:23:00.990
And to be in Jehovah's creation and beyond the trails, it helps me to be able to have time to pray and to meditate.

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:07.619
And I can talk to Jehovah and be able to express myself.

00:23:07.619 --> 00:23:13.619
Jehovah, what he has in store for each and every one of us, is not what we're dealing with now, but it's going to be paradise conditions.

00:23:14.619 --> 00:23:21.259
Not have the issues that we're dealing with today.

00:23:21.259 --> 00:23:25.259
Jehovah's helped me scale the wall and help me move forward.

00:23:25.259 --> 00:23:31.910
Court stays busy.

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:36.910
He gives to others and Jehovah continues to give right back to him.

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:40.910
You can be assured he'll do the same for you.

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:46.349
Maybe you've lost your mate for a different reason.

00:23:46.349 --> 00:23:49.349
Do you contend with feelings of loneliness?

00:23:49.349 --> 00:23:54.349
The following morning worship explains the emotional support Jehovah gives.

00:23:54.349 --> 00:24:07.210
About 28 years after Jesus' death, the Apostle Paul provided comfort to the brothers by means of our Scripture text today.

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:10.210
By means of this wonderful promise when Jehovah said,

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:15.210
I will not forget you, your works, and your love.

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:21.210
Now, why would the fact that Jehovah does not forget be of comfort to the brothers?

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:32.210
Don't you agree that if you tell somebody that you don't forget him or what he has done can have completely different meaning depending on the person and the circumstances?

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:39.210
Let us therefore focus on the meaning of Jehovah does not forget.

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:53.210
In order to make this discussion practical, maybe talk specifically to you dear sisters who lost your husband in death or whose husband was unfaithful.

00:24:53.210 --> 00:25:08.210
Similar to your situation, there must have been widows in Judea back then who went not only through the pain of losing their mate, but also had to deal with all the changes as well as economical and social challenges.

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:12.210
Therefore, you want to answer the following three questions.

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:18.210
How did Jehovah remember or not forget the widows' seraphas?

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:24.210
Then second, in what ways does Jehovah remember you dear sisters today?

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:31.210
And then thirdly, how can we all benefit from Jehovah's remembering?

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:34.210
So first of all, how did Jehovah remember the widow of the seraphas?

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:39.210
And I'd like to invite you to turn to first King 17.

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:51.210
As we know, during a drought, the Prophet Elijah was directed by God to go to the seraphas in order to be saved and kept alive through the help of a widow.

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:57.210
So Jehovah remembered the widow in that he took note of her.

00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:05.210
He saw her, he knew she would be willing to help and to be used by him, Jehovah saw her potential.

00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:07.210
Would the poor widow really help?

00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:12.210
We read in verses 15 and 16 of first King 17.

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:21.210
So she, the widow, went and did as Elijah said, and she, together with him and her household, ate for many days.

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:32.210
The large jar of flour did not run out and the small jar of oil did not run dry according to Jehovah's word that he had spoken through Elijah.

00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:42.210
Jehovah miraculously fed Elijah. Did he forget the widow? No. Jehovah became a saviour to the widow.

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:47.210
Instead of dying, the widow continued eating and drinking.

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:55.210
And even some time later, Jehovah did not forget the widow's faith and their words, household.

00:26:55.210 --> 00:27:01.210
After the death of the widow's son, Elijah asked Jehovah to resurrect the son.

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:06.210
We read in verses 22 and 24 to 24.

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:13.210
And Jehovah listened to Elijah's request and the life of the child came back into him and he revived.

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:23.210
Elijah took the child and brought him down from the roof chamber into the house and gave him to his mother and Elijah said, see your son is alive.

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:34.210
And that the woman said to Elijah, now I know that you truly are a man of God and that Jehovah's word in your mouth is truth.

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:44.210
What a blessing for the widow. Jehovah did not forget her work and faith. What a joyous moment. Jehovah became the great comforter.

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:54.210
Additionally, by means of her resurrected son, Jehovah cared for her as she grew old. Jehovah became the great provider.

00:27:55.210 --> 00:28:04.210
In Luke 4, Jesus makes a positive reference about her. So it could be that she could live out her days as a faithful servant of Jehovah.

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:12.210
How delighted she will be when Jehovah will remember her soon again and resurrect her.

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:22.210
So as we've seen in this example, Jehovah does not forget by becoming what the individual needs the most.

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:28.210
Now to our second Christians, our dear sisters, in what ways does Jehovah remember you today?

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:37.210
Let us please look at three scriptures to see what Jehovah becomes for you. Let's turn first of all to John chapter 14.

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:44.210
Because Jehovah knows that your maid who commanded you and who assured you in the past is not here anymore.

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:50.210
What helped Jesus to know that he was loved and approved?

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:59.210
He was strengthened by his father's approval, by his words. And now Jesus assures you in verse 21.

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:04.210
This is John 14, verse 21, when he says,

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:09.210
Whoever has my commandments on observes them is the one who loves me.

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:19.210
In turn, whoever loves me will be loved by my father. And I will love him and will clearly show myself to him.

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:28.210
So Jehovah loves you. Please do not allow Satan to create doubts in your mind.

00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:32.210
Doubts regarding our Heavenly Father's approval.

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:39.210
Instead, see the commendation and the love expressed by your brothers and sisters as coming from Jehovah.

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:47.210
Jehovah uses them because he does not forget your works and your love.

00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:51.210
Now the second scripture is Psalm 68.

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:56.210
Jehovah knows about the need you feel for security and protection.

00:29:56.210 --> 00:30:00.210
So he is becoming your protector.

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:04.210
We read in verse 5 of Psalm 68,

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:13.210
about Jehovah, a father of the father less enter, protector of widows.

00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:18.210
Yes, you are especially protected by our Heavenly Father.

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:22.210
For example, he protects you from spiritual harm.

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:25.210
He eclips you with what you need in order to avoid danger.

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:28.210
And so you are able to safeguard your friendship with him.

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:37.210
By means of his word and the publication, Jehovah makes his loving guidance and protection stand out to you.

00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:42.210
Now let's turn to the third scripture, Hebrews 13.

00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:47.210
Losing a husband goes along with anxiety regarding material things.

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:50.210
So what did you experience so far?

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:56.210
Did Jehovah's promise that is repeated by the Apostle Paul here in Hebrews 13,

00:30:56.210 --> 00:31:01.210
at the end of verse 5, proved to be true in your circumstances?

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:05.210
When he promised, I will never leave you.

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:08.210
I will never abandon you.

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:15.519
Jehovah does not forget your works in your love by becoming your provider.

00:31:15.519 --> 00:31:20.519
And please, allow other brothers and sisters to help you.

00:31:20.519 --> 00:31:23.519
This is the way Jehovah remembers you.

00:31:23.519 --> 00:31:29.519
Mention your needs to them so that Jehovah can use them to care for you.

00:31:29.519 --> 00:31:33.519
So Jehovah does not forget your works, your love,

00:31:33.519 --> 00:31:40.519
by assuring you of his approval, by becoming your protector and your provider.

00:31:40.519 --> 00:31:43.519
And in many more ways.

00:31:43.519 --> 00:31:50.519
Now, our final question was, how can you and how can we all benefit from Jehovah's remembering?

00:31:50.519 --> 00:31:56.519
What we discussed so far was something you heard many times before, nothing new.

00:31:56.519 --> 00:32:03.519
And yet, there are these moments where we just would like Jehovah to speak directly to us,

00:32:03.519 --> 00:32:11.519
saying, I see you, I see your works, I see your love, and I will not forget you.

00:32:11.519 --> 00:32:15.519
What can we do in these very moments?

00:32:15.519 --> 00:32:23.519
Now, God's words need to sound down in our mind and heart so that we are influenced by it.

00:32:23.519 --> 00:32:25.519
How can we accomplish this?

00:32:25.519 --> 00:32:30.519
By allowing our Bible reading to affect us deep inside.

00:32:30.519 --> 00:32:35.519
So as we meditate about what we read, we can ask us the question,

00:32:35.519 --> 00:32:40.519
do I really believe what I just read?

00:32:40.519 --> 00:32:45.519
Why am I sure that Bible examples are not isolated events,

00:32:45.519 --> 00:32:49.519
but are pattern of Jehovah's dealings with these loyal ones?

00:32:49.519 --> 00:32:55.519
Have I not seen and experienced this personally?

00:32:55.519 --> 00:32:58.519
Don't I see very good reason to believe that through the Scriptures,

00:32:58.519 --> 00:33:03.519
Jehovah is talking to me personally.

00:33:03.519 --> 00:33:12.519
Meditating about these questions will help us to feel Jehovah's sentiments are meant for us personally.

00:33:12.519 --> 00:33:17.519
And this in turn will help us to align our thinking with God's thinking.

00:33:17.519 --> 00:33:27.829
So, the widow of Saraphat reminded us of the many different ways Jehovah remembers widows

00:33:27.829 --> 00:33:33.829
and their love and their fine works, dear sisters.

00:33:33.829 --> 00:33:40.829
Please continue to see Jehovah as your provider, your protector,

00:33:40.829 --> 00:33:48.420
and the one that assures you personally of his love.

00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:52.420
You may feel abandoned, but you're never alone.

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:57.220
Jehovah sees you and loves you.

00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:00.220
Life can be hard through no fault of our own,

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:04.220
but sometimes it's hard because of our own mistakes.

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:06.220
How can we recover?

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:10.219
Let's see how the faithful woman, Mariam, did it.

00:34:10.219 --> 00:35:18.789
Discipline can be painful, appreciating it for what it truly is, takes faith.

00:35:18.789 --> 00:35:47.099
Moses.

00:35:47.099 --> 00:35:50.099
Mariam, oh, it's so good to see you.

00:35:50.099 --> 00:35:56.030
I've missed you.

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:57.030
It is time.

00:35:57.030 --> 00:36:28.820
I'll be exalted.

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:29.820
Please.

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:31.820
Don't give up on me.

00:36:31.820 --> 00:37:09.579
Mariam was well known in the camp of Israel.

00:37:09.579 --> 00:37:15.579
She enjoyed a close relationship with her brothers, Moses and Aaron.

00:37:15.579 --> 00:37:21.500
During the slavery in Egypt and the Exodus that followed,

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:25.500
the people had grown to respect and love her.

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:44.210
Zipura.

00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:46.210
Oh, welcome back.

00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:48.210
Aaron.

00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:54.210
Well, perhaps at first, Mariam was pleased to have Zipura back.

00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:56.210
How is Zipura settling in?

00:37:56.210 --> 00:38:00.710
Well, everyone seems excited.

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:02.710
Don't you think?

00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:09.619
But it seems that in time, she gave him to pride.

00:38:09.619 --> 00:38:25.030
She might have felt threatened.

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:28.030
Thank you, Zipura.

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:33.030
Thinking that Zipura would replace her as the most prominent woman in the nation.

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:43.159
In any case, Mariam and Aaron engaged in negative talk.

00:38:43.159 --> 00:38:46.159
But she's a cushite.

00:38:46.159 --> 00:38:49.500
And when she's as white.

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:52.070
Yes.

00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:54.070
But she's not one of us.

00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:59.250
Who knows how she influences him.

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:03.250
At first, their talk focused on Zipura.

00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:08.250
But it soon escalated into complaining about Moses himself.

00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:09.250
Welcome.

00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:11.250
The people need leadership.

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:14.250
And they trust us.

00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:16.250
Mariam.

00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:19.250
Jehovah is leading the people.

00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:32.320
You're not listening.

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:34.320
Mariam, where?

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:36.320
We are suffering out here.

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:38.320
Some of question my brothers.

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:40.320
Something has to be done.

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.320
I just don't understand.

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:43.320
Family is the most tired of this.

00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:44.320
I just don't understand.

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.320
We suffered in Egypt.

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:46.320
And we're suffering here.

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.320
Mariam is world.

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:50.320
Maybe there's a better winner ender need to注en the questions.

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:51.320
They just didn't understand.

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:53.320
Moses is still qualified to leave the nation.

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:54.320
Why is Jesus life surrendered to you?

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:56.239
Maybe Jehovah wants us to do something.

00:39:56.239 --> 00:39:57.239
Why do we have to let things be the most important to One?

00:39:57.239 --> 00:39:58.239
I'm sure other people feel the same.

00:39:58.239 --> 00:40:00.340
Shed and stayed in Egypt.

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:01.780
They just got to leave the nation.

00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:04.320
And when we're suffering here, there's a lot of frustrations now.

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.320
Itboat becomes more than Jesus.

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:08.300
Why do we listen to Moses' talk, Michael?

00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:09.280
Maybe that's죠.

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:12.679
wants us to do some of the things I can't agree to.

00:40:12.679 --> 00:40:15.880
Is it only by Moses that Jehovah is spoken?

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:23.889
Has he not also spoken to us?

00:40:23.889 --> 00:40:43.800
The three of you, to the tantam meeting,

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:54.619
hear my words, please.

00:40:54.619 --> 00:40:58.699
It is not that way with my servant, Moses.

00:40:58.699 --> 00:41:01.539
Face to face, I speak to him.

00:41:01.539 --> 00:41:05.699
And the appearance of Jehovah is what he sees.

00:41:05.699 --> 00:41:11.340
Why, then, did you not fear to speak against my servant,

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:39.579
against Moses?

00:41:39.579 --> 00:41:44.940
I beg you, my Lord, please do not hold this sin against us.

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:47.139
We have acted foolishly.

00:41:47.139 --> 00:41:54.519
Please do not let her continue like someone dead.

00:41:54.519 --> 00:42:00.440
Oh, God, please heal her.

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:14.570
Please.

00:42:14.570 --> 00:42:19.260
Let her be quarantined for seven days.

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:33.239
Afterward, she may be brought back.

00:42:33.239 --> 00:42:38.420
Jehovah, you are the most time.

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:42.139
You chose Moses to lead your people and I.

00:42:42.139 --> 00:42:44.420
I disrespected him.

00:42:44.420 --> 00:43:05.829
And you, please, please forgive me.

00:43:05.829 --> 00:43:16.409
Was not defined by her mistakes.

00:43:16.409 --> 00:43:19.570
Shall I go and call a nursing woman from the Hebrews

00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:24.030
to miss the child's free?

00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:25.949
It is time.

00:43:25.949 --> 00:43:39.300
Jehovah will bless you and Aaron.

00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:43.739
Jehovah disciplines those he loves.

00:43:43.739 --> 00:43:57.889
Miriam accepted his discipline with faith.

00:43:57.889 --> 00:44:01.289
She was restored to God's favor and continued

00:44:01.289 --> 00:44:21.000
serving faithfully for decades.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.559
Centuries afterward, Jehovah lovingly honored

00:44:24.559 --> 00:44:28.840
Miriam for her faithful service.

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:33.159
Through his prophet, Micah, he reminded his people.

00:44:33.159 --> 00:44:36.760
From the house of slavery I redeemed you.

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:51.510
I sent before you, Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:57.110
Miriam humbly used the discipline to draw closer to God.

00:44:57.110 --> 00:45:01.909
If you've made a serious mistake, don't give up on yourself.

00:45:01.909 --> 00:45:05.719
Jehovah hasn't.

00:45:05.719 --> 00:45:09.920
Injustice has grown out of control.

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:13.840
How does it make you feel when it's in front of you?

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:26.139
We'll learn from two young ones how they overcame inequality.

00:45:26.139 --> 00:45:30.139
Why did the fight for equality initially appeal to you?

00:45:30.139 --> 00:45:32.940
So Beviger has a history of legalized racism,

00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:35.340
but just because the laws changed,

00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:37.820
it doesn't mean that what's been in transition

00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:41.420
to the minds and hearts of people has also changed.

00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:44.579
I observed that people still had prejudices

00:45:44.579 --> 00:45:47.780
and they had ideas of what I should look like,

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:49.780
or talk like, or where I should live.

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:54.699
And I didn't feel like I was accepted anywhere.

00:45:54.699 --> 00:45:58.380
I realized that people's needs were not taking care of.

00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:02.699
For example, their living conditions were not great.

00:46:02.699 --> 00:46:05.739
Some had water and some didn't.

00:46:05.739 --> 00:46:07.900
I wanted to help people.

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:11.380
The time came when some political parties

00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:14.179
were saying that they could make a change.

00:46:14.179 --> 00:46:18.340
Now, in my heart, although I wouldn't say it,

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:21.579
little by little, I started to support them.

00:46:21.579 --> 00:46:24.019
Protests are so powerful.

00:46:24.019 --> 00:46:27.780
Everything's so loud and so moving.

00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:31.420
Different colors, cultures, boys, girls,

00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:35.860
everybody getting together to fight for the equality of others.

00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:41.099
I wanted to be part of making a change.

00:46:41.099 --> 00:46:45.139
What changes did you notice in yourself?

00:46:45.139 --> 00:46:47.539
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic,

00:46:47.539 --> 00:46:49.659
I could no longer go out freely.

00:46:49.659 --> 00:46:53.820
Yes, I did other things, but I also watched TV.

00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:56.820
When I watched TV, I noticed the things I used to see

00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:58.699
while I was preaching.

00:46:58.699 --> 00:47:01.579
The way women and children, the elderly,

00:47:01.579 --> 00:47:04.420
and the immigrants in this country were treated,

00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:06.739
it made me want to do something.

00:47:06.739 --> 00:47:09.619
My school also had a protest.

00:47:09.619 --> 00:47:12.860
I knew that I couldn't protest as one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:16.019
So it was a bit frustrating.

00:47:16.019 --> 00:47:18.500
And I also felt bad about not getting involved,

00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:20.659
like I was a bystander.

00:47:20.659 --> 00:47:22.820
I looked like I didn't care.

00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:26.739
And I didn't want anyone to think that that was the case.

00:47:26.739 --> 00:47:31.659
My parents noticed that I had become very focused on these things.

00:47:31.659 --> 00:47:36.340
Sometimes I would even ask why people were treated this way.

00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:38.780
They helped me in many ways.

00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:42.219
They used relevant JW broadcasting episodes.

00:47:42.219 --> 00:47:45.179
They also helped me through family worship.

00:47:45.179 --> 00:47:49.900
The 2019 Love Never Fails Convention was my favorite convention.

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:51.980
The talk that stood out to me the most

00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:55.780
spoke about how love believes all things.

00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:57.460
If we love our brothers and sisters,

00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:00.460
that means that we believe that they have

00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:03.460
the best intentions towards us and towards each other.

00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:07.900
I realized that I have to let go of negative and critical thinking.

00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:12.380
And now I have such amazing friendships with a variety of people.

00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:17.019
But to see the love that they have for me and for each other,

00:48:17.019 --> 00:48:20.300
I get to show that and also receive it.

00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:25.059
The scripture that came to mind was Jeremiah 1023,

00:48:25.059 --> 00:48:29.260
where it says that it does not belong to man to direct a step.

00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:31.699
Thinking about that scripture made me realize

00:48:31.699 --> 00:48:34.500
that people will not have success.

00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:38.900
They have never succeeded in the past and even now I see people fail.

00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:44.340
For me to show support, either by protesting or on social media,

00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:47.739
would be like painting a sinking ship.

00:48:47.739 --> 00:48:55.829
This world is sinking and it won't do me any good to show support for it.

00:48:55.829 --> 00:49:00.280
How are you conquering injustice today?

00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:05.519
I don't feel like I'm a bystander anymore or that I'm not involved.

00:49:05.519 --> 00:49:10.760
Instead of feeling like exhausted and there's no change,

00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:15.840
I get to help people, giving people a hope for the future that comes from the Bible.

00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:22.809
Now I don't focus much on news about how people are treated, the injustice.

00:49:22.809 --> 00:49:27.050
But as a volunteer who preaches full time,

00:49:27.050 --> 00:49:31.409
I help people to know Jehovah, know the truth,

00:49:31.409 --> 00:49:36.380
and know what Jehovah has in store for them in the future.

00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:38.340
During my Bible study with my dad,

00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:40.699
he studied prophecies in the fulfillment of them.

00:49:40.699 --> 00:49:48.380
And so I got to see that whatever Jehovah promised, he fulfilled 100%.

00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:55.019
So whatever his promise for the future, he's also going to fulfill.

00:49:55.019 --> 00:49:57.500
Jehovah's people have love.

00:49:57.500 --> 00:50:00.260
They support each other in difficult times,

00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:02.980
even though they speak different languages.

00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:08.019
They come from different places, different countries.

00:50:08.019 --> 00:50:13.820
It convinces me that even in the future, under the rule of God's kingdom,

00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:29.199
everyone in the world will be showing that love.

00:50:29.199 --> 00:50:32.599
When we see injustice, we want to help.

00:50:32.599 --> 00:50:35.199
We're not unfeeling robots.

00:50:35.199 --> 00:50:43.679
Like Emma and Alwanda, we use our energy to help people experience lasting comfort.

00:50:43.679 --> 00:50:49.639
In this month's program, we've seen how to accept discipline with humility,

00:50:49.639 --> 00:50:53.760
how to fight injustice with lasting acts of love,

00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:59.519
and how to scale the unexpected walls of life with Jehovah's help.

00:50:59.519 --> 00:51:12.380
And our music video beautifully sums up many of the points we've considered.

00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:28.929
Jehovah God of all of life's cares,

00:51:28.929 --> 00:51:33.039
I approach your throne.

00:51:33.039 --> 00:51:45.039
So show them and tell me, get through.

00:51:45.039 --> 00:55:24.119
I do pray of your spirit with the strength of gain.

00:55:24.119 --> 00:55:27.360
This month's postcard comes from Canada,

00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:32.360
where you'll find snow-capped mountains, crystal clear freshwater lakes,

00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:34.920
and sweeping prairies.

00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:38.880
Tourists travel from around the world to see Canada's moose,

00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:42.599
black bears, and woodland caribou.

00:55:42.599 --> 00:55:47.440
You'll also find one of the world's largest deposits of dinosaur fossils,

00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:51.440
and no trips complete without trying the local foods.

00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:56.480
You can have poutine, french fries, smothered in gravy, and cheese curds,

00:55:56.480 --> 00:56:00.159
or sweets made with maple syrup.

00:56:00.159 --> 00:56:04.039
Canada's unique in having the world's longest coastline,

00:56:04.039 --> 00:56:08.199
where our Canadian brothers have a rich history of preaching.

00:56:08.199 --> 00:56:11.199
In 1930, a motorboat named the Charmian,

00:56:11.199 --> 00:56:13.719
equipped with a powerful speaker system,

00:56:13.719 --> 00:56:17.920
was used to project Bible lectures across the water.

00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:26.320
And in the 1940s, the Kingdom I carried ministers up and down the Newfoundland and Labrador coasts.

00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:31.320
And that zealous pattern continues to this day in the fishing towns of Newfoundland,

00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:36.360
at the lighthouses of Nova Scotia, and at the harbors of British Columbia.

00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:43.199
Canada had an all-time high of regular pioneers and publishers in 2023.

00:56:43.199 --> 00:56:48.119
The Casa Loma congregation in Ontario wished to send their love and greetings

00:56:48.119 --> 00:56:50.519
to the worldwide brotherhood.

00:56:50.519 --> 00:56:55.719
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.
