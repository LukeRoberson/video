00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:04.610
When we're faced with challenging assignments,

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.250
reliance on Jehovah is of utmost importance.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.050
In what ways can we show that reliance?

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.250
I have the pleasure of introducing you to a friend of mine,

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.809
Shane Brady, who is presently serving along with his wife,

00:00:19.809 --> 00:00:23.129
Yolanda, at the branch in Finland.

00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:25.649
Brothers Shane Brady and I previously worked together

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:27.329
at the Canada branch.

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:31.089
Shane has been involved in legally defending our brothers

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:34.850
for the past 22 years in many countries,

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.450
including Armenia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.890
Shane, it's good to see you. How are you doing?

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.210
You're doing very well. It's great to see you too, Mark.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.890
Shane, we want to ask you what have been some of the challenges

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.609
that you've faced in accepting these assignments

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:55.090
in various countries in the world?

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.289
Well, there certainly have been a few challenges.

00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:02.210
One is frequent travel. Another is language.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.810
Each country that we assist has its own language.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.090
Some court cases are very stressful.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.810
And at times, we've faced firsthand the hatred of our composers.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.209
Yes. And you know, Shane, in spite of all that,

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:21.810
you and your wife have always been willing to go on these assignments.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.530
We appreciate your spirit so much.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.129
Is there an experience that you can share with us

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:30.930
that would give us a taste of the kind of situations

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.489
that you've had to deal with in these countries?

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:35.810
Well, there have been many experiences.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.010
One experience that comes to mind a few months ago,

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.530
there was a special pioneer, a case was started against him.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.769
And if the decision was negative, it could be

00:01:44.769 --> 00:01:48.769
have very serious consequences for our work in that country.

00:01:48.769 --> 00:01:52.530
So we did our best to present a strong defense.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.329
But as the trial progressed, things didn't seem to be going so well.

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.010
But on the last day of the trial, everything changed.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.810
We presented a motion and we asked the judge

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.370
to terminate the case against the brother.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.009
Personally, I didn't think it would actually work.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.729
But one older brother that we worked with over the years,

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:13.569
he always told us we need to give you

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.770
hope of something to bless. And so we did.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.210
And the results were quite unexpected.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.849
When we made the motion, the judge turned to the prosecutor

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.849
asked, well, what's your opinion?

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.449
And to our surprise, the prosecutor agreed with our request.

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:30.530
And he even went beyond what we asked.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.169
He said to the judge that the government official

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:35.090
that started the case against our brother

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.610
should be punished.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.569
Well, the judge agreed the case was terminated.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.530
When we were walking out of the courtroom,

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.129
I looked at the other brothers with me.

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.370
And we all said the same thing like, what happened?

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:48.289
Well, it was obvious.

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:49.889
Jehovah had intervened.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.050
That's wonderful, Shane.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.610
I wish we had more time to hear many more experiences.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.689
But could you just share at least one more with us?

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:58.129
Sure.

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:02.610
In another land where our work is not recognized,

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.610
on the night of the memorial,

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.530
a number of the brothers were arrested

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.729
for so-called illegal religious activity.

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:11.009
They were all convicted of trial.

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:14.930
So arrangements were made to appeal each of those cases.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.729
And they were heard before a different appeal court judge.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.490
What at first seemed quite negative,

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.250
the law set trial turned out to be an amazing result.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.689
Let me give you just one example.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.689
In one of the appeals as we were presenting the appeal,

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:33.969
not long into the case, the appeal court judge stopped us.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.289
And he began to ask us many questions about the Bible,

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.770
about what Jehovah's Witnesses believed.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.889
So for quite some time, we answered these biblical questions.

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:45.569
And then the case continued.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.610
And then after some minutes, the judge stopped us again.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.090
And this time the judge said,

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.689
I remember reading in the Bible.

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:53.569
The judge said this.

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.530
I remember reading in the Bible that Jesus said,

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:58.610
if they have persecuted me,

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:00.770
they will persecute you also.

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:02.610
So we said to the judge, yes.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.289
Indeed, that Jesus said that.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.370
The judge asked,

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.449
do you think that's the reason why

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:10.930
Jehovah's Witnesses are having problems in this region?

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:14.449
Well, what could we say, but agree with the judge?

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.689
But that wasn't the end of it.

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.129
As the case continued,

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:20.370
a few minutes more, the judge stopped us again.

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.370
And this time the judge said,

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.930
you know, I'm not sure if Jesus said this.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.769
It's in the Bible where he said,

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.970
where there are two or three gathered together,

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:31.970
there I am in your midst.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.290
And we assured the judge indeed, those are Jesus words.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.410
And the judge looked out at this old courtroom,

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.970
which was filled with our brothers and sisters and he said,

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.250
well, Jesus must be in our midst today.

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:46.209
We felt like breaking into applause.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.089
At the end of the court hearing the judge

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:51.009
ruled in our favor, acquitted the brother

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:53.329
and the judges and all of the other cases

00:04:53.329 --> 00:04:54.930
were also acquitted our brothers.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.769
It was just a thrilling experience.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:58.449
Oh, that's wonderful.

00:04:58.449 --> 00:04:59.329
That's wonderful, Shane.

00:04:59.329 --> 00:05:01.730
Thank you so much for sharing those experiences.

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.689
You know, despite the challenges that you've had to face,

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.569
how do you feel about the way you and Yolanda have benefited from

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:12.370
being involved in accepting these challenging assignments

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:13.569
in various parts of the world?

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:17.490
Well, we have benefited in so many ways, Mark.

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:21.089
Our relationship with Jehovah has has deepened.

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:24.850
Certainly, our trust in Jehovah has been strengthened.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.449
And we've experienced firsthand the love

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:30.769
of the amazing worldwide brotherhood.

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:33.410
Could I just share one experience about that?

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:34.610
But please, please do.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.649
Two years ago, we were involved in a case

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:41.329
where police had raided a congregation meeting in one country.

00:05:41.329 --> 00:05:43.730
They had brutally beaten the brothers,

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:44.610
threatened the sisters.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:45.569
It was just terrible.

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:50.370
Some weeks later, in the court case that continued or started

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.930
against the brothers, the police brought against the brothers.

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.889
During that court case, the police repeatedly tried

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:59.569
to arrest me and another brother I was working with over two days.

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:01.170
They were trying to arrest us.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.769
Even in the courthouse, they tried to detain an arrest.

00:06:04.769 --> 00:06:07.089
And all this, all through this, my wife, Yolanda,

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:08.370
was watching what was happening.

00:06:09.329 --> 00:06:14.209
But you know, what was so remarkable was, despite the brutal treatment,

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:16.850
our brothers and sisters had endured just a few weeks earlier,

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.649
at the hands of these very same police officers,

00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:22.449
those dear brothers and sisters came to our aid.

00:06:23.329 --> 00:06:26.050
They were like a wall of protection around us

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.730
and they would not leave our side until the ordeal was done.

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:31.810
It was love and action.

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:35.730
So to answer your question, we have benefited in so many ways.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.889
We don't regret for a moment.

00:06:38.209 --> 00:06:40.050
Accepting this thrilling assignment.

00:06:41.329 --> 00:06:43.730
Well, thank you so much, Shane.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:45.970
Please give our love to Yolanda as well.

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.089
We appreciate the tremendous work that you're accomplishing

00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:51.730
and Major Hove's spirit continue to be with you.

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:52.769
It's our privilege.

00:06:52.769 --> 00:06:55.569
We look forward to continuing to work with you, Mark.
