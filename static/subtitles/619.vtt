00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:08.560
Now, today's text comments are from the Watchtower article who is the King of the North today,

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.080
and that's the theme of our discussion this morning.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.760
That Watchtower listed three requirements for a government to fill the role of the King

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.440
of the North.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.960
First, it would interact directly with God's people.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.960
Second, this King would show he's an enemy of Jehovah and his people.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.280
And third, he would compete with the King of the South.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.960
And in our discussion, we're going to consider three questions.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.799
First, how has each King of the North throughout history shown hostility toward Jehovah and

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:47.520
his people?

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.560
Second, how does the current King of the North follow the pattern of those previous kings?

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.479
And third, how have God's people responded to his attacks?

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:07.040
So first, we want to look throughout history how each King of the North has shown enmity

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.640
toward Jehovah and his people.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.200
Now the first King of the North mentioned in Daniel's prophecy was the salucid dynasty

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.000
that ruled the northern part of the Greek empire that had been conquered by Alexander

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.959
the Great.

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:29.519
Daniel foretold that this militaristic King would be occupied with his rival, read toward

00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:31.040
the King of the South.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.719
And at that time, it was the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt.

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:41.680
To unify his kingdom, the King of the North promoted Greek culture or Hellenism, and that

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.760
included the worship of the Greek gods.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:53.280
When Antiochus the fourth ruled, he declared himself a pifenis, and that means the manifestation

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.000
because he was claiming to be a manifestation of the God Zeus.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.480
He then took over the temple in Jerusalem, and he dedicated it to Zeus.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.520
He built an altar over Jehovah's altar, and he sacrificed swine on it.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.759
Then he took the broth from that swine and sprinkled it all throughout the temple.

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:22.360
This was an absolute act of contempt toward Jehovah and toward his people, and it resulted

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:29.439
in a Jewish uprising in which the temple worship was successfully restored, and Antiochus

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:31.560
was defeated.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.879
Now think if Antiochus had succeeded in corrupting temple worship, when Jesus came to earth,

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:42.199
he could not have fully carried out the Mosaic law.

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:48.919
So it's no wonder that Jehovah did not allow this attack of the King of the North to succeed.

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:55.879
And as a side point, the study note on John 1022 shows that Jesus observed that festival

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:03.919
of dedication that was actually commemorating the victory over that first King of the North.

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:09.400
Next the Roman Empire assumed the role of the King of the North, and especially during

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.919
the reigns of Nero and Demission, they strongly opposed Christianity.

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:19.080
And insight on the scriptures explains one reason.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:26.379
It says, quote, Rome tolerated almost any sort of religious practice, as long as those

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:31.680
who held to it would also share in the worship of the emperor.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.900
Well, because Christians refused emperor worship, many of them were persecuted and even

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.039
executed by that King of the North.

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:48.879
Now coming down to the time of the end, the German Empire and later the Nazi regime assumed

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:54.199
the role of the King of the North, as our watch tower pointed out.

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:59.319
And the Nazis especially demanded worship of the state.

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:04.159
Religion was only tolerated if it supported state policies.

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:12.879
And in fact, in a 1933 radio address, Lutheran minister Otto, who was celebrating Hitler's

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:18.879
birthday at that time, explained that the ban on Jehovah's Witnesses in Saxony was the

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:26.639
direct result of close cooperation between the Lutheran Church and the Nazi regime.

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:36.319
The Nazis hated Jehovah's people for refusing to hire Adolf Hitler as their furor or leader.

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:40.879
We know that Hitler vowed to exterminate our brothers.

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:47.000
And some did become martyrs like Brother Dickman on the left, but others survived like this

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.480
group from the Gusen concentration camp that included Brother Martin Puttsinger.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.639
But as a group, our brothers conquered the Nazi regime.

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:04.639
Their outstanding faith and integrity has been documented in countless accounts, including

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:07.920
the 1974 yearbook.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.879
Now when the Nazi regime ended, the role of the King of the North was assumed by the Soviet

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:15.120
block of nations.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:22.519
And Daniel 1137 foretold that this King would show no regard for the god of his fathers.

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:26.680
The Soviet regime was officially atheistic.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:32.879
Daniel 1141 also foretold, as we heard in our comments, that he would invade the land

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:38.680
of decoration or the realm of activity of Jehovah's people.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:44.879
Many thousands of our brothers were executed or exiled and some were executed because they

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:53.120
refused to compromise their worship of Jehovah under this atheistic regime.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.480
Now after considering these few details, would you agree that every one of those kings

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.360
of the North would have classified our brothers as extremists?

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.279
Absolutely.

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:11.399
None of them would tolerate worship of Jehovah over worship of the state.

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:16.720
But coming down to our day, many of us remember the shock when the Soviet Union collapsed

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.040
in 1991.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:24.439
The King of the North had suddenly vanished and it left only the King of the South, the

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:28.319
Anglo-American world power, standing.

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:35.319
So in 1993, the Watchtower expressed the questions of many.

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:38.360
So who is the King of the North now?

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:44.160
Is he to be identified with one of the countries that were part of the old Soviet Union?

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:50.920
Or is he changing identity completely as he has a number of times before?

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:56.319
Only time will provide the answers to these questions.

00:06:56.319 --> 00:07:03.040
And the answer for us came at the 2018 annual meeting when it was clearly announced that

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:08.720
Russia and its allies were the new King of the North.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:14.360
How does this current King of the North fit the pattern of previous kings of the North?

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.959
Well, although there was relative peace between the King of the North and South for a time

00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:29.000
they were engaged again in a hostile pushing or a locking horns as our footnote mentions.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:38.040
Now this term, the literal Hebrew term locking horns is used at Exodus 21 of a bull, goring

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.600
a man or a woman to death.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:48.720
Also at 1 Kings 22-11, a false prophet used the term to refer to a violent goring of

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.720
the Syrians until they were exterminated.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:59.720
So locking horns gives a picture of one bull trying to gore another to death until in

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.279
a violent fight to the death.

00:08:02.279 --> 00:08:10.040
And we see an example of this violent pushing and locking horns in Ukraine today.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:16.240
Like his predecessors in the last days, this King has also invaded the land of decoration

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:21.040
or the realm of God's people by labeling them extremists.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.120
And he has shown extreme contempt for Jehovah.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:30.000
Now one difference between Russia and the Soviet Union is that Russia is not officially

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
atheistic.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.480
Currently it is in an unholy embrace with the Russian Orthodox Church.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:43.879
But as we saw, other kings of the North also tolerated and even promoted religion.

00:08:43.879 --> 00:08:49.440
They just demanded that religion be subservient to the state.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:56.159
So Russia and its allies fit the pattern of the other kings of the North in every respect.

00:08:56.159 --> 00:09:05.559
And this gives us full confidence that every detail of Daniel's prophecy is being fulfilled.

00:09:05.559 --> 00:09:11.879
And finally, how have God's people responded to attacks of the King of the North?

00:09:11.879 --> 00:09:17.879
We saw that Jehovah gave his people victory over the attack of Antiochus Epiphanes when

00:09:17.879 --> 00:09:21.320
he invaded Jehovah's Temple.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:25.559
Pergamum was a center of emperor worship in the first century.

00:09:25.559 --> 00:09:32.879
And Jesus told Christians at Revelation 2.13, you keep holding fast to my name and you

00:09:32.879 --> 00:09:36.519
did not deny your faith in me.

00:09:36.519 --> 00:09:42.279
Our German brothers prevailed over the brutal Nazi regime.

00:09:42.279 --> 00:09:48.919
One observer said, each member seems to be a fortress which can be destroyed but never

00:09:48.919 --> 00:09:49.919
taken.

00:09:49.919 --> 00:09:52.759
In other words, never conquered.

00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:57.960
And we see powerful evidence that Jehovah is fortifying our Russian brothers today.
