00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:11.529
By means of an angel, Jehovah God told his dear friend Abraham that he was going to destroy

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:15.269
the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah.

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:24.510
The angel said, the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is indeed great, and their sin is

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.179
very heavy.

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.060
Abraham was troubled.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.740
He apparently wondered whether Jehovah had taken all of the factors into consideration

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.820
before he made that decision to destroy the cities.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:50.619
So he asked, will the judge of all the earth not do what is right?

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:55.780
Well we can understand why Abraham would ask that question.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.140
It was early days in his relationship with Jehovah God.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.079
He was just beginning to get acquainted with Jehovah, and we can hardly imagine him

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:12.219
asking the same question later when he knew Jehovah much better.

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:16.620
But have you ever asked a similar question?

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.299
Maybe when you were just coming into the truth?

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:27.060
Have you ever asked, for example, will none of those who died in the flood get a resurrection,

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.060
even those who may never have heard of Noah?

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.700
And what about Sodom and Gomorrah?

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.719
Will everyone who died in Sodom and Gomorrah sleep and everlasting sleep the women, the

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:45.780
children, babies?

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:55.939
And was there not one redeemable Assyrian soldier in that band of 185,000 who died at the

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:59.650
hand of Jehovah's angel?

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:06.409
We don't have the answer to those questions, but we do know one thing.

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:13.319
The merciful judge of all the earth will do what is right.

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.599
Wait a minute, did I hear that right?

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.159
We don't have the answer to those questions.

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.599
I thought we did.

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.520
In the past, our publications have stated that there's no hope of a resurrection for

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:34.520
those who died in the flood or those destroyed in Sodom and Gomorrah.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.080
But do we really know that?

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.919
The band of Sodom and Gomorrah were certainly wicked, and they deserved to die for what

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:44.719
they did.

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:49.639
But did they know any better?

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:53.280
How often did Lot and his family preach to them?

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:58.919
And are we saying that if special pioneers had been assigned to Sodom, that they would

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:04.319
have had no success whatsoever in preaching to the Sodomites, helping them to turn around

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.919
and come to an knowledge of Jehovah?

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:15.280
Can we say dogmatically that not one Sodomite would have repented if Jehovah's requirements

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.800
have been explained?

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.680
And then there's the fascinating statement made by Jesus, found at Matthew chapter 11.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:37.020
I'll give you a moment, Matthew chapter 11, and we're going to read verses 23 and 24.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.800
This is interesting.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.319
Matthew 11, 23 and 24.

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:51.759
And you, Capernaum, would you perhaps be exalted to heaven down to the grave, if you will

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:52.759
come?

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:58.680
Because, and notice this, if the powerful works that took place in you had taken place

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:05.319
in Sodom, it would have remained until this very day.

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:12.360
But I say to you, it will be more and durable for the land of Sodom on judgment day than

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.360
for you.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.759
It would have remained until this very day.

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:28.040
Jehovah's angel had told Abraham that if ten righteous men could be found in Sodom,

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.600
the city would not be destroyed.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:37.720
So was Jesus saying that if he had preached and performed powerful works in Sodom, ten

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:44.160
righteous men would have been found and the city would have been spared?

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:50.720
It's also of interest to consider Jehovah's words to unfaithful Judah in Ezekiel

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.720
16.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:58.720
Jehovah said that the citizens of Sodom were more righteous than the inhabitants of Judah.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.600
So if Sodom is doomed, what about Judah?

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.720
But what about the disciple Jude's statement that Sodom and Gomorrah would undergo the judicial

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.920
punishment of everlasting fire?

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:17.399
Well, that's certainly, we'll prove through of the cities, and probably many of the inhabitants

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:18.720
as well.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.639
But does it mean that there's no hope for any of them?

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:28.120
Jesus' statement, we just read, would indicate that there is hope for some.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.519
We just can't be dogmatic.

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:40.639
But again, we can say that the merciful judge of all the earth will do what is right.

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:43.639
Now let's talk about the flood of Noah's day.

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:49.000
In the past, we've said that any who died in the flood would not be resurrected.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.759
But does the Bible say that?

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:54.759
Now Noah's contemporaries certainly were wicked.

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:59.759
At the Bible says that man's wickedness was great on the earth, and every inclination

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:04.319
of the thoughts of his heart was only bad all the time.

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:08.439
So those living at that time were sinners.

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:12.600
But did they all get a thorough witness?

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.040
Oh, and his family must have been very busy building the ark.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.839
How much time did they have for preaching?

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:25.209
And were they able to do seldom worked territory?

00:06:25.209 --> 00:06:29.569
We have found that people who live within ten miles of Bethel have never heard of Jehovah's

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:30.970
Witnesses.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:37.529
So can we guarantee that everyone living on earth during that time knew of Noah and what

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:38.730
he was doing?

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:40.649
We can't really say that.

00:06:40.649 --> 00:06:45.949
And can we say that if someone had been given an adequate opportunity, he still would

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:49.329
have turned his back on Jehovah?

00:06:49.329 --> 00:06:51.610
We just can't say that.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:56.569
Now, of course, if Jehovah didn't bring them back, they wouldn't have any grounds for

00:06:56.569 --> 00:06:58.649
complaint.

00:06:58.649 --> 00:07:00.529
They've had life.

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:04.889
And life is more than any of us deserves.

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:09.329
As you know, when Adam and Eve sinned, Jehovah could have destroyed them right away.

00:07:09.329 --> 00:07:15.250
And instead, he gave them the opportunity to have sons and daughters, and as a result,

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.730
we were born.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:25.850
So the fact that you and I have drawn one breath is pure undeserved kindness on Jehovah's

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:27.370
part.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:33.050
Now, on the other hand, for many years, it was suggested that all those who the Bible says

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:37.649
were buried with their forefathers were going to have a resurrection.

00:07:37.649 --> 00:07:40.250
A Solomon was one of those.

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:47.449
The Bible says of him, then Solomon was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried

00:07:47.449 --> 00:07:50.209
in the city of David, his father.

00:07:50.209 --> 00:07:55.569
Well, we reasoned that those who were buried with their forefathers were in the common

00:07:55.569 --> 00:07:56.569
grave of mankind.

00:07:56.569 --> 00:08:00.569
And we know that the common grave of mankind is going to be emptied during the thousand

00:08:00.569 --> 00:08:03.410
year reign of Christ.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:11.089
But we ask ourselves, when Bible writers said that someone was buried with his forefathers,

00:08:11.089 --> 00:08:15.329
were they really revealing what Jehovah's final judgment would be?

00:08:15.329 --> 00:08:21.769
Was Jehovah revealing to them, inspiring them to say how he was going to settle the case?

00:08:21.769 --> 00:08:27.009
Or the Bible writers really saying that this is the way the person was buried.

00:08:27.009 --> 00:08:29.329
This is the manner of his burial.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:35.250
Remember, in Bible times, the way someone was buried was very important.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:39.250
Joseph and Jacob refused to be buried in Egypt.

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:44.250
High priest, Jehovah, was buried with the kings of Judah because of all the good things

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.250
he had done.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:51.289
And when a prophet said that a certain king was going to have the burial of a donkey, that

00:08:51.289 --> 00:08:54.559
wasn't good.

00:08:54.559 --> 00:09:00.120
Solomon was the second wisest man ever to walk the earth.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.559
Jehovah appeared to him twice.

00:09:01.559 --> 00:09:06.399
And the second time he appeared to him, he said, if you and your sons turn away from

00:09:06.399 --> 00:09:14.480
following me and go and serve other gods and bow down to them, I will cut Israel off

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.759
from the surface of the land.

00:09:17.759 --> 00:09:20.080
What did Solomon do?

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:25.960
He began to serve other gods and bow down to them.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.320
How will the judge of all the earth view that?

00:09:30.039 --> 00:09:32.799
That's not for us to say.

00:09:32.799 --> 00:09:37.240
So we can't be dogmatic about the prospects of those who are said to be buried with their

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.240
forefathers.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:43.840
It could be that the Bible was just indicating the manner of their burial.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.759
Now that isn't to say that they won't be resurrected.

00:09:46.759 --> 00:09:50.879
It simply means that we don't know.

00:09:50.879 --> 00:09:53.080
The righteous judge knows.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:56.559
And we know that he'll do the right thing.

00:09:56.559 --> 00:10:00.039
All what do we know about Jehovah?

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:02.240
Why can we trust him to do the right thing?

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.919
Well, look at the record.

00:10:04.919 --> 00:10:10.279
In the days of the Prophet Joel, God's people were in a sick spiritual condition.

00:10:10.279 --> 00:10:15.480
They were worshipping the bails and the golden calves and sacred poles.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:19.919
They were lying, committing adultery, stealing, shedding innocent blood, oppressing widows

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:21.879
and orphans.

00:10:21.879 --> 00:10:24.559
Jehovah had good reason to wipe the whole nation out.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.519
And yet what do we read at Joel 213?

00:10:27.519 --> 00:10:34.960
Joel says, rip apart your hearts and not your garments and return to Jehovah your God

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:41.480
for he is compassionate and merciful, slow to anger and abundant in royal love.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:47.659
And he will reconsider the calamity.

00:10:47.659 --> 00:10:55.340
He will reconsider the calamity after all that Jehovah was willing to show mercy.

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:59.659
Now this is very encouraging.

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:02.500
Why?

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:08.500
Many of our brothers have no trouble accepting the fact that Jehovah will forgive the sins

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:14.870
they committed in their ignorance before they came to a knowledge of the truth.

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:20.990
But if they've committed to sin after baptism, they're afraid that Jehovah will never

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:23.190
forget and he will never forgive them.

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:24.629
And yet what do we see here?

00:11:24.629 --> 00:11:29.629
The nation of Israel was in a dedicated situation before Jehovah.

00:11:29.629 --> 00:11:34.830
And yet Jehovah said, if you stop doing what is wrong, if you start doing what is right,

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:38.870
I will reconsider.

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:42.389
Then you have the encouraging words found at Ezekiel 33.

00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:46.870
Let's read this.

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:52.549
And I find that this is a good passage to read to brothers and sisters who may feel that

00:11:52.549 --> 00:11:55.789
Jehovah could never forgive them for what they've done.

00:11:55.789 --> 00:12:06.340
Ezekiel 33, verses 14 and 16, verse 14 first.

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:11.340
And when I say to the wicked one, you will surely die.

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:20.019
And he turns away from his sin and does what is just and righteous, verse 16, none of the

00:12:20.019 --> 00:12:25.419
sins he committed will be held against him for doing what is just and right.

00:12:25.419 --> 00:12:29.500
Righteous, he will surely keep living.

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:34.980
Now, isn't that encouraging for someone who strayed from the truth?

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:42.019
Maybe God involved in some bad conduct and far too many of these are afraid that Jehovah

00:12:42.019 --> 00:12:43.659
will never forgive them.

00:12:43.659 --> 00:12:45.179
They would love to come back to the truth.

00:12:45.179 --> 00:12:49.019
They would love to come back to Jehovah, but they're afraid that Jehovah is not going

00:12:49.019 --> 00:12:50.019
to accept them.

00:12:50.019 --> 00:12:57.059
And yet he says none of the sins he committed will be held against him.

00:12:57.059 --> 00:12:59.379
The case of King Manasseh makes the point.

00:12:59.379 --> 00:13:03.820
He was in a dedicated relationship with Jehovah, and yet for most of his life he did what

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:04.820
was wrong.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:12.139
But when he repented, turned around and started doing what was right, Jehovah wiped the

00:13:12.139 --> 00:13:13.460
slate clean.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:19.899
What a marvelous, merciful God, we worship.

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:25.620
He shows that Jehovah was so mercy whenever he sees a basis for doing so.

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:31.700
Now, consider how Jehovah dealt with the people of Nineveh in the days of Jonah.

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:38.620
Their conduct was so bad that Jehovah was determined to destroy the city, and Jonah was in agreement

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:39.620
with that.

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:42.059
Yeah, wipe them all out.

00:13:42.059 --> 00:13:46.820
But Jehovah was more merciful than Jonah was.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:51.379
And when he saw that the people repented and turned around, he was willing to forgive

00:13:51.379 --> 00:13:52.379
them.

00:13:52.379 --> 00:13:53.379
Why?

00:13:53.379 --> 00:13:55.179
The Bible tells us why.

00:13:55.179 --> 00:14:00.549
They didn't know right from wrong.

00:14:00.549 --> 00:14:03.629
They didn't know any better.

00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:10.269
While some of those Ninevehites be back, Jesus' words found at Matthew 12-41 seemed to indicate

00:14:10.269 --> 00:14:17.590
that they will, he said, men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgment with this generation

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:22.190
and will condemn it because they repented at what Jonah preached.

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:27.070
But look, something more than Jonah is here.

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:29.990
So what do we see from these examples?

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:34.789
The men of Nineveh, Manassa, and others.

00:14:34.789 --> 00:14:36.149
They were wicked.

00:14:36.149 --> 00:14:38.029
They did bad things.

00:14:38.029 --> 00:14:39.509
They repented.

00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:45.429
They started to do what was right, and Jehovah wiped the slate clean.

00:14:46.429 --> 00:14:50.350
Well today, power for judging has been given to someone else.

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:53.470
There's a different judge of all the earth.

00:14:53.470 --> 00:15:04.360
And we read about him at John chapter 5, John chapter 5, and we're going to read verse

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.360
22.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:09.120
I'll give you a moment.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:13.000
John 5 and 22.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:21.220
For the Father judges no one at all, but He has entrusted all the judging, all the

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:24.500
judging to the Son.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:29.779
Jesus has been given authority to judge the living and the dead.

00:15:29.779 --> 00:15:32.620
Well, can we trust Him?

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:35.460
Can we be sure that Jesus will be merciful?

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:36.460
Absolutely.

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:39.139
He's the exact image of His Father.

00:15:39.139 --> 00:15:45.460
And the prophet Isaiah wrote of him, he will not judge by what appears to his eyes, nor

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:49.259
reproof simply according to what His ears hear.

00:15:49.259 --> 00:15:54.580
He will judge the lowly with fairness, and with uprightness, He will give reproof in

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:58.460
behalf of the weak ones of the earth.

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:04.259
The authority that Jesus has been given includes the authority to resurrect the dead.

00:16:04.259 --> 00:16:06.820
He's the resurrection and the life.

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:12.940
Now, you know, we often say that Jehovah God knows everything about those who have died,

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:14.539
and that's true.

00:16:14.539 --> 00:16:19.860
But since Jesus is doing the resurrecting, it's reasonable to conclude that He also knows

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:26.580
everything about the dead and the living, and He's going to be able to resurrect them

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:27.580
accurately.

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:31.299
Now, whether He'll share the power to resurrect with His anointed brothers when they're raised

00:16:31.299 --> 00:16:34.419
to heaven, remains to be seen.

00:16:34.419 --> 00:16:36.220
We'll stay tuned.

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:41.100
Well, what's the takeaway from this talk so far?

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:44.779
How would you explain it to someone who wasn't here today?

00:16:44.779 --> 00:16:49.620
You would not say, someone who died in Sodom of Gomorrah and in the flood are going to

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:52.419
be resurrected, and Solomon isn't going to be resurrected.

00:16:52.419 --> 00:16:55.899
No, no, no, you wouldn't say that.

00:16:55.899 --> 00:17:02.899
What we're saying is that we shouldn't be dogmatic about who will and who will not be

00:17:02.899 --> 00:17:04.220
resurrected.

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:06.740
We just don't know.

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.619
But we trust Jehovah God.

00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:13.660
We trust Jesus Christ that they will do what is right.
