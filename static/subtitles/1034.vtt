00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:06.780
I could tell from the doctor's voice, the news wasn't good.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:13.539
I just didn't expect my health to worsen so quickly.

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:18.539
If a gun is what I need to protect my family, won't Jehovah understand?

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:30.789
I knew how mom felt about the holidays, but I also learned how Jehovah felt.

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.789
It was as if a veil had been lifted from my eyes.

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:40.520
That was the moment Jehovah introduced himself to me.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.520
In my darkest times, Jehovah's words brought me comfort.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:55.799
I knew these words would build my faith.

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:59.799
Trust in Jehovah and do what is good.
