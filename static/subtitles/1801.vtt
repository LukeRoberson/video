00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:08.419
We are proud to represent the sovereign of the universe and his son, even if we are persecuted.

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:15.419
Brother Nikolai Nigrech from Russia has experienced persecution firsthand many times.

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:31.219
In spite of that, he has maintained his joy in his service to Jehovah.

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:35.219
My mother came very close to never seeing me again.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.670
I asked her to tell me what happened.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.670
She told me that in April of 1952, she had been sent to a labor camp.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:16.109
She got ten years for refusing to betray the brothers taking the lead.

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:23.109
It was a big thing back then that a pregnant woman was given such a long sentence.

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:33.060
I was born in the labor camp on August 6, 1952.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.170
As my mother told me, one winter I became critical ill.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.170
I had tuberculosis of the bone.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.180
The doctors didn't think I could recover.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.180
So they called me father to come and take me away.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.180
I was only a year and a half old.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.180
My father picked me up and carried me to the village where he lived.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.180
He showed me to some doctors and they were horrified at my condition.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:13.180
They were afraid to take responsibility for me.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:20.180
My father said that one of the doctors there, a woman, felt compassion for me

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.180
and said she would take on my case.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.180
The treatment she prescribed was very painful.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.180
But it worked.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:37.620
I did recover from the disease.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.620
One sunny day we were at home in our house in the village.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:49.139
My grandmother was there and my father.

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:56.349
I looked and the woman came in the house and stood in the door.

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:00.349
And someone, either my father or my grandmother, said,

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:09.349
that's your mother, then I looked at her again more closely.

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:16.139
She was wearing a striped dress.

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:21.139
Later I realized that I have been wearing the same striped clothes

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:29.930
when my father came to the prison to get me.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.930
She took out a toy car, green, made of metal.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.930
She pushed it and it clotted up to my feet and stopped.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:46.930
It was the first time that I really understood that I had a mother.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.930
She had come and she was right here.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:58.659
I felt very good.

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:04.659
I ran out to the field in front of our house and shouted to our neighbors.

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:07.659
Mama has come. Mama has come.

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:11.659
This was the first really happy event in my life that I remember,

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:13.659
that I met my mother.

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:20.060
I get excited just remembering it.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.060
How it all happened.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:32.319
But my mother and I came very close to never seeing each other again.

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:37.319
She said that all the women in the labor camp worked in the forest.

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:40.319
The snow was waist high.

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:44.319
It was very cold. They were cutting down trees.

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:54.819
On one occasion, they were being led back to the camp from the forest.

00:04:54.819 --> 00:05:02.220
My mother's sled got stuck on a tree stump.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.220
The horse could not pull it free.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.220
The guards somehow didn't notice.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.220
Then they realized that a horse and a prisoner were missing.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:29.009
One of the soldiers ran towards my mother with a rifle.

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:32.009
He was already cocking it.

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:36.009
My mother told me later that she was terrified.

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:39.009
She thought that her life was over.

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:43.009
But the other soldier stopped him and said, it's not her fault.

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:51.470
She got stuck.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:06:03.180
That story I will always remember.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.180
I grew up partly without a mother because she was imprisoned.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:14.180
Then it turned out that my son grew up without a father because I was imprisoned.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:26.740
I was also imprisoned for my faith.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.740
When I was sent to prison, my wife was pregnant.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:36.740
I didn't see my son until a few months after he was born.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.060
The first time she brought him, he was tiny.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:46.060
It was during the winter and it was very cold.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.060
She brought him to the prison to see me.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:54.060
She wrapped him in blankets and there he was, wiggling.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:07:00.680
She showed him to me, saying, here is your son.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:06.680
I felt very tense and trapped because the prison woman was standing right behind me.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:11.680
But I also felt very happy to have a real family.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:16.379
It was very hard to leave them.

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:29.420
I wanted to hold my son but they didn't let me.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:37.420
The god whom we serve, Jehovah, acted in our hearts and minds with his holy spirit.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:43.420
So these trials did not affect us in the way they affected other people.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.420
We were optimistic about the future.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:51.420
We were confident that God would not leave his servants.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:54.420
I saw this in my own case.

00:07:54.420 --> 00:08:03.430
Now I can look back with a smile while remembering everything I lived through.
