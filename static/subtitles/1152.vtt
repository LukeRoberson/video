00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:08.550
Our previous parts have reminded us that Jehovah's creation, of flowers and food and colors,

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.550
all demonstrate that Jehovah wants us to be happy, to be joyful.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.550
Well, in this part, we're going to see that Jehovah designed our bodies in a way that shows

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.550
that he wants us to be happy as well.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.550
Now, Jehovah designed us with the amazing capacity for motion.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.550
A humans can walk, we can run, we can swim, we can dance.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.549
In fact, if you turn in your Bibles to Acts chapter 17 and verse 28,

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:39.549
you will see that this is a God-given ability.

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:42.549
Acts chapter 17 and verse 28.

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:49.549
For by Him we have life and move and exist.

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:55.549
This word here move refers to the ability from Jehovah for us to be active.

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:58.549
But with that in mind, we have two questions.

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:06.549
One is, are there lessons that we can learn from how Jehovah designed us that can help us to rejoice?

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:12.549
And number two, are there lessons that we can learn that can help us in our worship of Jehovah?

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:14.549
Well, let's consider those two points.

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:22.549
But first, let's watch the following video that will help us appreciate the marvelous way in which we were designed.

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:28.719
Our bodies are designed to move.

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:42.260
The way we move can be complex or precise.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:52.310
It could require strength or stamina.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:02:02.459
Walking involves the coordination of dozens of muscles.

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:06.459
Muscles are controlled by our brain and nervous system.

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:14.460
They support and move our bones and are powered by the food we eat and the oxygen we breathe.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:23.110
Everybody part is a marvel of engineering.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:40.110
The knee is designed to withstand repeated impact, surrounding tissue cushions and aligns it.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.110
Finding suggests that regular movement helps prevent joint damage.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.509
The body is a machine that strengthens as we use it.

00:02:52.509 --> 00:03:00.009
Movement helps us to stay healthy and feel good.

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:07.439
The body is a credit to its creator.

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:18.889
For by him, we have life and move and exist.

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:24.889
The makeup of the human body proves that Jehovah wants us not just to exist, but to be happy.

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:26.889
But do you remember our first question?

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:30.889
What lessons can we learn? Well, there's two of them.

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:35.889
One, as the video highlighted, Jehovah designed our bodies to move.

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:41.889
Did you note the comment? Movement helps us stay healthy and feel good.

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:49.889
Research has established that leading a physically active life can help us to think clearly, to feel happier.

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:52.889
Have more energy. Be more productive.

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:57.889
What an incredible gift from Jehovah. He created us to move.

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:04.889
And also, he created us in a way that the more we move, the more we exercise, we work, we do things for others,

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:07.889
the happier we are.

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:14.889
And the second point is that Jehovah designed our bodies with many different parts, but to work as one unit.

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:19.889
Did you notice the coordination needed just to walk? Something we take for granted.

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.889
And what about our knee?

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.889
Can you imagine if our knee did not work in harmony with the rest of the body?

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.889
What if every time we stood up, we weren't sure which way it would bend?

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.889
How complicated that would be.

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.889
But no, Jehovah created our bodies to work as one complete unit.

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:45.889
And did you notice also the video stated that our body is like a machine with many different moving parts, but it all works together.

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:53.889
But a unique difference between a machine and our body is that our body strengthens as we use it.

00:04:53.889 --> 00:05:00.889
Now, you think about that. If you go out and you buy a car, you buy a bicycle, you may think that's a successful purchase.

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:09.889
If it operates as intended, but you would never expect that car or bicycle to improve and go stronger every time you use it.

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:12.889
But that's what happens to our body.

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:18.889
And that allows us to exercise, walk, run, swim, dance, even more.

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:21.889
And the more we move, the happier we are.

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:28.889
What an incredible design. How we appreciate our bodies is wonderful gift from Jehovah.

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:31.889
But remember our second question.

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:38.889
Are there lessons that we can learn from the body that can help us to be happy in our worship of Jehovah?

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:41.889
Well, let's consider those same two points again.

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:45.889
Remember we said that Jehovah designed our bodies to move.

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:47.889
So what should we do?

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:54.300
Well, let's look together to 1 Corinthians chapter 15 and verse 58.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.300
1 Corinthians 15, 58.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:05.300
It says, therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast and movable, always having plenty to do in the work of the Lord,

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.300
knowing that your labor is not in vain in connection with the Lord.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.300
So what do we need to do?

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.300
Move, stay busy, have plenty to do in the work of the Lord.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:22.300
And Jehovah gave us further reason for rejoicing by giving us meaningful work to do.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:29.300
Now, many of you dear brothers and sisters have said that you've never felt busier than you do now.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.300
Do you think that's a coincidence?

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.300
Do you think it's a coincidence that the darker and more depressing these last days have become

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.300
that you are busier than ever in Jehovah's work? No!

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:48.300
See, that is one of the ways that Jehovah uses to help us to be happy and healthy in these last days.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:53.300
Now, we know that our primary work is that of preaching the good news of the kingdom.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:59.300
And we do that through the house to house preaching work, we do that through public witnessing, through Bible studies.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:06.300
But even when this work is restricted due to world events, we still find ways to preach.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:17.300
And when we have plenty to do in the work of the Lord, in the preaching work, we're happy and we're better able to put our troubles into perspective.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:25.300
Now, others of you support the kingdom work by serving at Bethel or by constructing and renovating theocratic facilities,

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:33.300
others of you sharing relief work, but whatever you do, it brings joy and it brings glory to Jehovah.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.300
So here's a question.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:43.300
Are you staying as busy as you can in your circumstances allow in Jehovah's work?

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:50.300
Continue to have plenty to do in the work of the Lord. You'll be happy and you'll never regret it.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:59.300
But now, our second point, we also establish a Jehovah designed our body with many parts to work as one unit.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.300
Well, what lesson do we learn from that?

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:06.300
We'll look over to Ephesians chapter 4 and verse 16.

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:12.180
Ephesians chapter 4 and verse 16.

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:21.180
And it says, from him, all the body is harmoniously joined together and made to cooperate through every joint that gives what is needed.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:30.180
When each respective member functions properly, this contributes to the growth of the body as it builds itself up in love.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.179
So what do we learn from this?

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:37.179
Stay united, cooperate together, function properly.

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:42.179
We learn that every part of the human body is necessary and it must work together.

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:48.179
Well, similarly, the congregation is made up of many different members.

00:08:48.179 --> 00:08:57.179
Each member, each of you, whether young or old, strong or frail, all of you contribute to the whole and the beauty of the congregation.

00:08:57.179 --> 00:09:03.179
Each one of you is needed. You are special to Jehovah and your brothers and sisters.

00:09:03.179 --> 00:09:08.179
And did you see when the congregation is harmoniously joined together, what happens?

00:09:08.179 --> 00:09:11.179
The congregation is built up.

00:09:11.179 --> 00:09:19.179
Now, again, many of you have said that you've never felt closer to each other or Jehovah's organization than you do now.

00:09:19.179 --> 00:09:22.179
Again, that's no coincidence.

00:09:22.179 --> 00:09:32.179
As the end draws near, Jehovah's gathering us closer and closer together in unity and those bonds among us need to grow even stronger.

00:09:32.179 --> 00:09:39.179
So how much we appreciate and how much we can learn from the wonderful way in which we are made.

00:09:39.179 --> 00:09:47.179
May each of us, and remember those two points, be determined to be as active as possible, move in Jehovah's service,

00:09:47.179 --> 00:09:53.179
and two, may each of us do all that we can to promote unity.

00:09:53.179 --> 00:09:56.179
And if you do, you will be happy.

00:09:56.179 --> 00:10:02.179
And not only will you bring joy to yourself, but you'll bring joy to others as well.

00:10:02.179 --> 00:10:10.179
But now, Brother Gaius Glockentine, a helper to the publishing committee will now present the next talk of this symposium,

00:10:10.179 --> 00:10:16.179
Creation proves that Jehovah wants us to rejoice delightful sounds.
