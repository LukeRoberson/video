00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:09.560
When I was a child I attended a boarding school. All of my basic needs were

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:16.859
taken care of, but on the weekends I noticed that the other kids had parents

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:25.089
that would take them home. No one ever came to take me home. They seemed so

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:39.149
happy. I was alone. My name is Nazar Kamar. I was born in Kiev, Ukraine. And seven

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:49.219
days after I was born, when I was still just a baby. My parents abandoned me. The

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:55.140
school principal and teachers took turns caring for me, but I saw the other

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.579
parents and how much they loved their children. I really wanted to have my own

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:09.180
parents. I waited for them to come, but they never did. It was very painful. So I

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:18.400
decided I needed a goal to focus on. I hoped my parents were looking for me and I

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.920
thought playing sports might help them find me. They might see me and recognize

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.879
that I am their son. I concentrated on getting good enough to play professionally.

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:37.540
I learned to play very well, but my hope always was that when I traveled to

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.060
different places, my parents might be sitting in the stands and they would see

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:54.810
me and say, this is our son. We found you. I began playing in a national league. And the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:02.170
team provided me a small room to live in and began to pay me a salary. It was not

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:12.979
much and not enough to live on. So I also got a job working at a factory. While

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:20.340
working there, I met Sergei. He was one of Joe's witnesses. He would show me

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.939
scriptures from the Bible, like Revelation 21, 3 and 4, about a future paradise

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:33.629
with wonderful conditions where there would be no more suffering or pain. I wanted a

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:40.629
life like that. But I didn't see those conditions around me. My life was very

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:49.210
hard. So these promises were difficult to believe. Sergei also showed me God's name in the

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:56.449
Bible at Exodus 153. And he explained to me the meaning of God's name, Jehovah, that he

00:02:56.449 --> 00:03:02.530
can become whatever he chooses to become. When I connected that name with his promise

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:12.180
at Revelation 21, 3 and 4, it was then that I started to believe it. At my first meeting,

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.340
I was amazed by what I saw. The hearing and the deaf were communicating together. They

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:26.210
had unity and they cared for each other. I felt comfortable there. At one of the meetings,

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:33.770
I saw the verse at Psalm 68.5, which refers to Jehovah God as the Father of the Fatherless.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:40.370
I was touched. He knows exactly how hard it is to be an orphan. He fully understands

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:47.750
me. He gave me goose bumps and I felt an inner peace and comfort. When my basketball team

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.949
and the deaf community learned that I was studying the Bible with Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:03:53.949 --> 00:04:00.409
they were very upset with me. They told me I would lose their support. I would lose my

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:12.080
salary and housing. I was at a crossroads. Since I'm an orphan, where would I live? This

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:21.480
was a very difficult time. I noticed that I didn't feel the same unity or connection with

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:31.980
my team as I did with Jehovah's Witnesses. So, I decided to continue to study the Bible.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:43.420
I gave up their support and got baptized. Jehovah has blessed me. I am no longer alone.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:53.439
I have my own family now. My wife, Yevdekia. We love and cherish each other so much. He

00:04:53.439 --> 00:05:01.480
has also given me brothers and sisters who care about me. They are my spiritual family.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:10.040
My life is no longer full of pain. Today, I still search for my parents and wait for them.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:18.560
Because when I find them, I want to help them by telling them about God's name. Now, I

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:25.319
no longer consider myself an orphan because I have a father. My father in heaven, whose

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:26.519
name is Jehovah.
