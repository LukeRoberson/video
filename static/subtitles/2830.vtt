00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:14.609
My Lord, this is Jeremiah from Manifeth.

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:17.910
The man whom Jehovah has called to be a prophet, welcome.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.809
King Josiah, all the faithful ones

00:00:19.809 --> 00:00:22.410
support your campaign against a Dollar Tree.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.410
We have done as you direct them, my Lord.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.109
And since you began this campaign 18 months ago,

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.109
you have gained many supporters.

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.509
This is true yet.

00:00:34.509 --> 00:00:38.909
Many have continued worshiping Bale, men like Ben Matten.

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:42.240
Pose a great threat.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.240
The people may even resort to violence

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.570
to oppose this great work.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.469
No doubt.

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.619
My Lord, do you feel that you may not have

00:00:56.619 --> 00:01:02.619
what it takes to complete such a task?

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:09.890
Restoring pure worship will take much more effort.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.489
What it's the right thing to do.

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:14.689
You're right, Josiah.

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.489
But you're not doing this in human strength.

00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:20.290
Jehovah is on your side.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.890
You will give you the courage, wisdom, and strength

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.290
to complete this work.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.890
When I expressed doubt in my own abilities,

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.390
Jehovah told me, do not say I am just a boy.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.890
But Jehovah spoke to you directly, Jeremiah.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.189
How can I be sure that he'll back me up that way?

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.390
Jeremiah just told me of a prophecy, given hundreds of years ago

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.290
after King Jeroboam set up his own altar in the northern kingdom.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.290
By the word of Jehovah,

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.090
the man of God came from Judah to Bethel

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.290
while Jeroboam was standing by the altar

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.590
to make sacrificial smoke.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.290
Then he called out against the altar

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.989
by the word of Jehovah and said,

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:08.590
oh, altar, altar.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.189
This is what Jehovah says.

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:14.789
Look, a son named Josiah will be born

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:17.189
to the house of David.

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:21.889
And he will sacrifice on you the priests of the high places,

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:25.789
those making sacrificial smoke on you.

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:30.560
And he will burn human bones on you.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.759
So do not waver in a lack of faith, Josiah.

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:41.060
Become powerful by faith, like our father Abraham.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.259
Jehovah also spoke to me, Josiah.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.159
He said, I will wipe out from this place every vestige of bail.

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.960
The name of the foreign god priests, along with the priests.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.560
I will call to account the princes, the sons of the king

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.460
and all those wearing foreign clothing.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.360
Neither their silver nor their gold will save them.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.960
He will bring to nothing all the gods of the earth.
