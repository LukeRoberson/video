00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:08.240
Creating a set of blueprints for the construction of a house requires that the

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:14.259
architect consider each individual detail, but he must also ensure that

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:22.670
everything harmonizes with the overall design. What about the design of life?

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.109
Do we also see evidence of careful planning and an overall harmony between

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:36.859
living things? Our world is filled with marvels of creation. Each wonderfully

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:42.979
unique. Yet, as we have considered, all living organisms have something

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:51.219
fundamental in common. Our DNA blueprint. From these incredibly tiny molecules

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:58.299
come all the complexity and diversity of life, but even beyond the physical

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:03.820
appearance, behaviors, abilities, and instincts of individual organisms, DNA

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.540
spells out the potential for amazing interactions between different creations.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.939
The more we observe the natural world around us, the more we begin to see an

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:22.500
underlying harmony emerging from the design of life. For example, many flowering

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.500
plants produce nectar, which serves as a food for insects and other animals. But

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.739
the benefit is not one-sided. As bees drink nectar from a flower, they're

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:38.140
dusted with tiny grains of pollen and carry these to other flowers of the same

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:45.379
kind. Many flowering plants and trees depend on this pollination to reproduce.

00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:51.579
Yes, by wonderful design, bees, plants, animals, and humans all benefit from

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:58.140
this relationship. Hidden beneath the soil, we find another beneficial

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.420
relationship between plants and fungus. Since they are unable to produce their

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.979
own food, certain fungi infect the roots of plants and absorb carbohydrates from

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.460
their host. But instead of being harmful, the fungus can actually help the

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.340
plant. The filaments of the fungus provide a much greater surface area to

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.139
absorb minerals and water, which are shared with the plant. Additionally, the

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:31.180
fungus can extend into soil that is inaccessible to the roots of the plant.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.539
With this assistance, the plant is able to take in more nutrients from the soil,

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:44.460
grow faster, and better tolerate extreme conditions. Virtually all plants

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:51.580
benefit from this type of helpful relationship with fungus. In the depths of

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.620
the oceans, we find more alliances between different kinds of creatures. Some

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:04.020
very unexpected. Groups of large fish gather in areas where smaller, cleaner

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.740
fish assist them by removing dead skin and parasites from the visitors.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:14.419
Under other circumstances, the larger fish might eat the smaller ones. But at

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:21.430
these cleaning stations, the large fish allow themselves to be attended to. Most

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.189
fish avoid the stinging tentacles of the sea anemone. But the clown fish makes a

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:31.550
home right in among them. A special coating on its skin protects the clown

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:38.349
fish from being stung. In this way, the clown fish is safe from predators. In

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:43.629
return, the clown fish may share food with the anemone and provide protection

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:50.789
against anemone eating fish. Elsewhere, a goby fish and a shrimp live together

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:57.030
in the shrimp's burrow. To protect its nearly blind host, the goby stands guard

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:03.960
and taps the shrimp with its tail to warn of danger. These are just a few

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.439
examples of the interconnections we see all around us when we look more closely

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:14.719
at the natural world. How do these instinctively wise creatures know to form

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:21.410
partnerships with others so different from themselves? Somehow, the potential

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:28.959
for these relationships is recorded within the DNA of each one. Yes, life is not

00:04:28.959 --> 00:04:34.199
just a random collection of individual creations, but rather a marvelously

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:41.199
orchestrated masterpiece of design. Each living thing plays its part in perfect

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:46.600
harmony with others around it. Joining together in the magnificent symphony of

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:55.269
life to learn more about creation is to gaze and wonder at design and

00:04:55.269 --> 00:05:01.470
engineering far superior to anything mankind has devised. It is to catch a glimpse

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:10.019
of the mind of the master designer, Jehovah God. You are worthy Jehovah to receive

00:05:10.019 --> 00:05:17.860
the glory and the honor and the power because you created all things.
