00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:14.779
For more than 100 years, Jehovah's Witnesses have proclaimed the Bible's message that God's kingdom will rid the world of wickedness,

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:19.780
restore the earth to paradise and raise mankind to perfection.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:27.780
Sharing this truth, however, has often resulted in persecution from powerful institutions.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:33.780
But why has such a positive message elicited such a negative reaction?

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.780
And how have we overcome that opposition to get to where we are today?

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:47.780
This is the story of a people intent on living in the light of Bible truth, no matter what hostility they may face.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:58.780
As you watch, note the determination of Jehovah's modern-day servants to study diligently, preach zealously, and keep serving God faithfully.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.780
This video is more than just history. This is your story.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:13.780
It's a reminder that Jehovah God is in full control, and that this is His organization.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:22.780
It is a story that begins over 6,000 years ago, the story of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:37.799
In the Bible, light is associated with truth.

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:48.650
Whereas darkness is associated with falsehood.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:55.650
When God completed His creative works, there was no spiritual darkness.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.650
But after Adam and Eve sinned, human society came under the control of Satan.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:12.159
Shunning the light would become the foremost goal of wicked people.

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:21.000
Anyone seeking truth in such a world would be opposed.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The light of truth shone brightly.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:36.379
When Jesus Christ walked the earth, all who truly followed Jesus reflected the light He radiated.

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:45.560
But Jesus foretold that after the death of His apostles, there would be a falling away from pure worship.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:56.560
That apostasy would be so extensive that genuine disciples would practically disappear until the conclusion of the system of things.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:06.930
At the same time, a counterfeit form of Christianity would flourish, and so it happened.

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:19.759
So-called Christian churches deviated from Christ's teachings.

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:27.810
The result was the abuse of power and untold suffering.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:35.800
This was a period of deep darkness.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:45.629
In the centuries after the establishment of the Christian congregation,

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:55.629
we see how many of those who were taking the lead in the Christian church or the Christian congregation started to likewise love worldly wisdom.

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:04.629
These ideas that came from Plato and other of the Greek philosophers started to infiltrate the so-called Christian thinking.

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:14.629
And so the apostates wished to blend a Christian teaching and Christian tradition with pagan religious ideas.

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:23.629
And the idea was to make these things more acceptable to other pagans so that pagans could be drawn into the Christian religion.

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:33.360
As the centuries passed, apostate religious leaders obscured the light even further by keeping the Bible in Latin.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.360
A language no longer understood by most people.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:48.360
Yet, at certain points during this darkness, there were still individuals who felt keenly the need to read and understand God's word.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:59.360
For example, in the 1100s, a French merchant known as Vogue commissioned a translation of Bible books into the language of the common people.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:09.060
Two centuries later, Catholic priest John Wickliffe wrote powerfully against unbiblical practices of the church.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:15.060
By 1382, Wickliffe's team released the first translation of the Bible into English.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:22.500
His students, known as Lollards, preached the Bible's message to anyone who would listen.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:36.579
By 1495, the invention of movable type made it possible to print all or part of the Bible in 12 languages.

00:05:36.579 --> 00:05:41.959
Soon, people were reading it for themselves.

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:48.959
And some who did began to discern that the church had gone off course.

00:05:48.959 --> 00:06:01.959
In the 1500s, such men as Haldright Swingley, Martin Luther and John Calvin preached the need to return to the original principles of Christianity.

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:16.980
These men and others tried to expose hypocritical practices and uphold Bible teachings, even though this put them at odds with powerful religious authorities.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:26.540
You can see, ones that were willing to stand out as being different, even though they didn't have a full knowledge of the truth.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:44.290
But standing out led to persecution and persecution often led to compromise, especially when it came to preacher.

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:55.009
Nevertheless, in many lands, the 16 and 1700s were marked by a strong upsurge in Bible study.

00:06:55.009 --> 00:07:01.009
In England, many learned men refuted the Trinity doctrine as unscriptural.

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:11.009
Among them, scientists Sir Isaac Newton, poet John Milton, and chemist Joseph Priestley.

00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:19.009
Besides rejecting the Trinity doctrine, Priestley declared that the teaching of the inherent immortality of the soul was false.

00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:27.009
He held that the first century Christians had the true faith, and that any change to that pattern of belief was a corruption.

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:38.100
His opinions sparked a heated controversy, both in the church and in the government.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:50.740
In 1791, a mob destroyed Priestley's house and laboratory, the pressure mounted for three more years until he fled to the United States.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:56.019
He was followed by many others who held his views.

00:07:56.019 --> 00:08:00.329
Among them, Henry grew.

00:08:00.329 --> 00:08:10.060
By 1807, at age 25, grew was invited to serve as pastor of the Baptist Church in Hartford, Connecticut.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:19.060
And yet a very interesting philosophy on the study of the Bible led Scripture interpret Scripture.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:25.060
Drew's point was that the Bible was its own best interpreter.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:31.060
Now, as he studied the Bible, he began to realize that the doctrine of the Trinity was false.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:36.059
Well, you couldn't be a Baptist minister and not believe in the Trinity.

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:41.059
After four years, Drew and several others withdrew from the church.

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:55.509
In later years, Drew published writings in which he used the Bible to refute the Trinity, Hellfire, and the inherent immortality of the soul.

00:08:55.509 --> 00:09:03.509
And Drew argued that immortality, according to the Bible, is a gift that God bestows on the faithful.

00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:18.429
It is not a gift that he bestows on the wicked, so how could the wicked have an immortal soul?

00:09:18.429 --> 00:09:31.679
Drew's pamphlet would have far-reaching effects. His work caught the attention of Methodist minister George Storbs.

00:09:31.679 --> 00:09:40.389
Intrigued, Storbs spent the next three years studying the matter.

00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:42.389
The Scriptures are clear on his point.

00:09:42.389 --> 00:09:46.389
Yet his findings met with little interest by his fellow ministers.

00:09:46.389 --> 00:09:52.389
In Ezekiel 184, the soul that sineth, it shall die.

00:09:52.389 --> 00:10:00.389
And finally, by 1840, his conscience troubled him so much over the difference between what the Bible was teaching,

00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:09.389
and what he was being obliged to teach as a Methodist Episcopal minister, that he resigned his position.

00:10:09.389 --> 00:10:16.389
In 1842, Storbs began publishing a monthly magazine entitled Bible Examiner.

00:10:16.389 --> 00:10:21.899
Before long, he met Henry Drew in person.

00:10:21.899 --> 00:10:29.899
The two became close friends and collaborated in debates against proponents of the immortal soul doctrine.

00:10:29.899 --> 00:10:33.899
Yes, and that Scripture Ezekiel 184.

00:10:33.899 --> 00:10:43.179
George Storbs believed that in order for everyone living during the time of Christ's return to have an opportunity for salvation,

00:10:43.179 --> 00:10:47.179
a global preaching campaign was needed.

00:10:47.179 --> 00:10:53.179
He had no idea how such a thing could be accomplished, but in faith he wrote,

00:10:53.179 --> 00:11:01.179
Yet too many, if they cannot see just how a thing is to be done, rejected.

00:11:01.179 --> 00:11:05.179
As if it were impossible for God.

00:11:05.179 --> 00:11:14.889
Storbs died in 1879 at his home in Brooklyn, New York.

00:11:14.889 --> 00:11:25.029
In the very neighborhood that would become the focal point of the worldwide preaching work he had so eagerly anticipated,

00:11:25.029 --> 00:11:31.029
the stage was now set for light to emerge from darkness.

00:11:31.029 --> 00:11:59.850
It was in 1845 that Joseph and Analyzer Russell emigrated from Ireland to Pennsylvania, USA.

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:05.850
They would have five children, among them Charles Tays.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:11.850
But times were hard, his brother Thomas died at age five.

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:41.690
Before Charles turned nine, two more of his siblings died, then his mother died.

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:51.690
Same year, 1861, the United States became embroiled in a civil war that would send 618,000 to their graves.

00:12:51.690 --> 00:13:17.559
Thousands perished on battlefields not far from where the Russians lived and worked.

00:13:17.559 --> 00:13:28.019
And they would be able to see firsthand the havoc that war wreaks on people, the suffering, the death.

00:13:28.019 --> 00:13:35.190
Young Charles Russell thought often about what happens to the dead.

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:39.190
Most religions held that God created man immortal.

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:43.190
And that he made a fiery hell in which to torment people forever.

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:50.100
Except those predestined for salvation.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:54.100
Russell's feelings about such teachings came through and what he wrote.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:14:05.740
A God that would use his power to create human beings, whom he forenew and predestinated should be eternally tormented.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:11.740
It would be neither wise, just nor loving.

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:17.240
His standard would be lower than that of many men.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:27.240
He could never reconcile the teaching of eternal torment with the description of the Bible of a loving God.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:35.240
As he examined the creeds of the great churches, when he saw that they taught that the wicked are tormented eternally,

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:39.240
he just could not accept that.

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:45.240
The whole religious culture at that time was a matter of believing that God was a God of vengeance.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:51.240
And Russell knew that the Bible said, as it does at first John 48, God is love.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:55.240
How could a God of love do this?

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:59.240
And so his faith wavered.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:03.240
He felt he could do the most good for people through business and philanthropy.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:11.240
As a preteen, he became his father's partner in a growing chain of clothing stores.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:19.240
Charles Russell enlarged the business, eventually operating a number of stores by himself.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:28.919
By age 25, he possessed over $300,000.

00:15:28.919 --> 00:15:40.970
The equivalent of $7 million today, yet his search for truth continued.

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:55.539
In 1869, something happened that would help reestablish his faith.

00:15:55.539 --> 00:16:12.330
Seemingly, by accident one evening, I had dropped into a dusty dingy hall

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:18.330
to see if the handful who met there had anything more sensible to offer than the creeds of the great churches.

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:28.679
Let's take note of the words of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Himself, to the apostles.

00:16:28.679 --> 00:16:36.679
There for the first time, I heard something of the views of second Adventists from the preacher Mr. Jonas Wendell.

00:16:36.679 --> 00:16:48.679
Though his scripture exposition was not entirely clear, it was sufficient, under God, to reestablish my wavering faith in the divine inspiration of the Bible.

00:16:48.679 --> 00:16:54.679
Now remember at this point, Russell is not an atheist, but he is just discouraged.

00:16:54.679 --> 00:17:08.680
He doesn't feel that truth can be found anywhere, and that, sermon by a second Adventist, was enough to get him to get his well-worn Bible off the shelf and to start digging again.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:12.680
As we've already seen, the word Trinity doesn't appear anywhere in the Bible.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:22.680
Fired with enthusiasm, Charles, his father Joseph, and a few acquaintances in Pittsburgh and Allegheny, formed a class for Bible study.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:34.680
They would take a subject, they would get a Bible concordance, they would look up every single scripture that had a bearing on the subject, and then they would write down their conclusions.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:42.680
And then they would say, all right, this is what the Bible teaches. We are going to believe that.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.680
Yes, and God's Word is clear.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:50.680
After five years of study, the religious thinking of these men had undergone remarkable change.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:58.680
Their study of the Bible led them to major conclusions that challenged the prevailing religious views of the day.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:13.299
For example, while most religions taught that man has a soul, Russell and his associates concluded that man is a soul, and that the soul can die.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:23.000
And whereas Christendom's churches teach that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are one person,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:30.859
these students held that Jehovah is one God, and not part of Trinity.

00:18:30.859 --> 00:18:38.859
In addition, while some churches were teaching that Christ would return in the flesh, and that the earth would be destroyed,

00:18:38.859 --> 00:18:50.259
this small group came to understand that Christ would return invisibly in the Spirit, with the purpose of blessing the obedient mankind.

00:18:50.259 --> 00:19:00.259
So it wasn't just philosophizing, just talking about what if, or perhaps this way, but they were focused on trying to actually find the truth.

00:19:00.259 --> 00:19:07.259
And the fact that they decided to write down those conclusions showed that they had a belief that there is some truth to be found.

00:19:07.259 --> 00:19:12.259
They only see light when it's Jehovah's time to reveal light.

00:19:12.259 --> 00:19:28.210
And so this was at the beginning of Jehovah's time to lead his people out of darkness into the wonderful light.

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:39.210
Charles Russell never professed to be divinely inspired. He acknowledged the assistance he had received from Jonas Wendell, from George Stores,

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:44.210
and from someone who also brought about one of his greatest tests of faith.

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:49.210
Nelson Barber, publisher of the journal, Harold of the Morning.

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:55.779
On a business trip, Russell received a copy of the Harold.

00:19:55.779 --> 00:20:04.779
Its contents were a surprise. Like Russell, Barber held that Christ's return would be invisible.

00:20:04.779 --> 00:20:08.779
Russell arranged a meeting with Barber.

00:20:08.779 --> 00:20:14.779
Soon, Russell's Bible study group of about 30 merged with Barber's larger group.

00:20:14.779 --> 00:20:18.779
Russell contributed funds to print Harold of the Morning.

00:20:18.779 --> 00:20:20.779
The business is an excellent one.

00:20:20.779 --> 00:20:25.779
By this time, Russell began to sell out his business interests in order to preach full time.

00:20:25.779 --> 00:20:27.779
Yes, and all that is needed for me.

00:20:27.779 --> 00:20:32.779
Leave this business behind and start a new life. There you are.

00:20:32.779 --> 00:20:37.779
Thank you. And I wish you well on your new endeavors.

00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:49.880
He was convinced that the presence of the Lord is of utmost importance.

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:55.880
The presence of Christ is not compared to the flood, but to the days of Noah.

00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:01.880
At the age of 25, he went from city to city to speak at various public gatherings.

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:07.880
On the streets, and to protest to churches and their clergy.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:12.880
He didn't want to form another church. There were already enough denominations in his mind.

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:18.880
There he presented these main Bible teachings to them and urged them to study the matter.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.880
And then to use their pulpits to preach that message.

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.880
But of course, they laughed and made fun of them and went their way.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:29.880
And then that's why Russell decided, well, somebody had to preach these things.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.880
So he would use his time and energies to do it.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:37.880
You would assume that being well off, he could have supported someone else.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:43.880
He could have taken the easy way out and perhaps funded someone else to do the work.

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:50.880
He allowed his whole life to center around it by selling his business and getting involved personally with it.

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:53.880
You can see the passion, the love that he had for the truth.

00:21:53.880 --> 00:22:01.680
Here's the man, Mr. Russell. Thank you.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:12.150
After two years of association with Nelson Barber, a dispute arose that would test the loyalty of each member of the Bible study group.

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:21.150
Barber had written an article for the heralds burning the teaching that Christ's death could provide a ransom for sinners.

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:33.150
Though professing to believe in the ransom, Barber wrote that the notion that Christ's death paid for mankind's sins was unscriptural and obnoxious to all our ideas of justice.

00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:37.150
Russell, his young co-editor, disagreed.

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:44.150
Through the pages of the herald, Russell went to great lengths to defend this Bible truth.

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:51.150
On pleasant though it be, I feel it necessary to take exception to an article by my brother on this subject.

00:22:51.150 --> 00:23:03.150
I make the objection not from a spirit of controversy, but because I believe the doctrine assailed in that article to be one of the most important teachings of God's word.

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:10.460
Jesus Christ, by the grace of God, tasted death for every man.

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:21.460
In the herald Barber fired back, I tell you such a theology is false and such justice and abhorrence to the principle of right and wrong.

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:33.940
Dismayed by Barber's refusal to accept this scriptural teaching, Russell asked him privately either to resign or to sell his share of the paper.

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:46.940
While I still feel that you are a brother in Christ, the points of variance seem to me to be so fundamental and important that full fellowship no longer obtains between you and me.

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:53.339
I feel that our relationship should cease.

00:23:53.339 --> 00:24:02.730
After months of controversy, Russell's group withdrew from Barber's.

00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:07.730
Eventually, Russell severed all ties with herald of the morning.

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:23.809
Brother Russell realized that he could not restore this man's wavering faith, in fact, lack of faith, and so he took it as the Lord's will that he began to publish another magazine.

00:24:23.809 --> 00:24:28.809
Zion's Watchtower and Herald of Christ's presence.

00:24:28.809 --> 00:24:34.569
First issue, July 1879.

00:24:34.569 --> 00:25:07.779
In the same year that Thomas Edison patented the electric light, Charles Russell had gone from student to publisher, thus dawned a new era of both literal and spiritual light.

00:25:07.779 --> 00:25:14.779
From its first installment, Zion's Watchtower championed firm belief in the ransom.

00:25:14.779 --> 00:25:21.150
Many who had associated with Nelson Barber sided with Russell on this issue.

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:31.359
In 1879 and 1880, Russell and the readers of Zion's Watchtower formed 30 congregations.

00:25:31.359 --> 00:25:37.359
Those who joined them became known simply as the Bible students.

00:25:37.359 --> 00:25:42.359
People who love the truth, they want to have answers to questions.

00:25:42.359 --> 00:25:48.359
Who is gone? Why are we here? Where are we going? And they're disillusioned by what they see in the churches.

00:25:48.359 --> 00:25:52.359
And so they're searching, and so they found something.

00:25:52.359 --> 00:26:04.359
Next, Russell and other dedicated Christians established a non-profit Bible society to enable them to give wider distribution to Bible literature in various languages.

00:26:04.359 --> 00:26:13.819
From the very beginning, it was agreed there would never be any begging or petitioning for money.

00:26:14.819 --> 00:26:18.819
The work would always be advanced through voluntary donations.

00:26:18.819 --> 00:26:28.380
With the annual commemoration of Christ's death came opportunities to hold large conventions.

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:39.789
In time, these were held regularly. Christian baptism was customary.

00:26:39.789 --> 00:26:51.269
The Bible students sought to adhere to the scriptural command to not forsake the assembling of themselves together.

00:26:51.269 --> 00:27:09.759
Another arrangement intended to encourage the small but growing number of Bible students came in 1894.

00:27:09.759 --> 00:27:18.420
Traveling representatives called pilgrims were dispatched to conduct meetings.

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:22.420
And to assist these fledgling congregations.

00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:37.769
About that time, Russell began to publish books containing the results of his biblical research, eventually writing six volumes.

00:27:38.769 --> 00:27:42.769
These books came to be known as studies in the scriptures.

00:27:42.769 --> 00:27:51.170
As people read these books, they were moved to share with others what they learned.

00:27:51.170 --> 00:28:00.869
Obviously, people that were honest-hearted could hear the ring of truth.

00:28:00.869 --> 00:28:08.869
They just saw that this is the truth, and it was quite different from what other Christian denominations were teaching.

00:28:09.869 --> 00:28:19.339
The impact of these volumes on the people was that really some immediately changed their things in their lives.

00:28:19.339 --> 00:28:25.339
The Bible students were putting into practice what they were learning from the scriptures.

00:28:25.339 --> 00:29:07.509
In 1881, the article wanted 1,000 preachers, invited readers of Zion's Watchtower to distribute Bible literature publicly.

00:29:07.509 --> 00:29:19.200
Some full-time preachers, called cold porters, preach from house to house, bringing the message directly to people's homes.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:27.859
The July 1881 Watchtower reminded readers that all true Christians have a responsibility to preach.

00:29:27.859 --> 00:29:31.859
They knew this was the truth, and they were telling people about it.

00:29:31.859 --> 00:29:39.339
Like every individual witness today knows he has the truth and has to tell people around him, and that's what it amounts to.

00:29:39.339 --> 00:29:49.339
In 1899, Zion's Watchtower proposed a new method of preaching, handing publications to people after they left church on Sunday.

00:29:49.339 --> 00:29:54.339
At one stage, Russell endeavoured to talk to the religious leaders.

00:29:54.339 --> 00:30:00.339
He could see then that there wasn't a chance to help modify those church systems.

00:30:00.339 --> 00:30:07.339
But rather, it was more important to approach individuals on an individual basis and give them the opportunity.

00:30:07.339 --> 00:30:11.339
You can imagine the reaction and the feelings of those that would come out.

00:30:11.339 --> 00:30:20.339
They've gone to an established church or religion. They've seen a man who, in their view, perhaps has been educated, knows what he's talking about.

00:30:20.339 --> 00:30:25.339
They go outside, hear a humble people trying to tell them something from the scriptures.

00:30:25.339 --> 00:30:30.339
I don't think our work was ever to be confrontational, but it was to draw attention to the message.

00:30:30.339 --> 00:30:34.339
Confertation came because we were there because we were doing the work.

00:30:34.339 --> 00:30:39.339
But the idea was to draw attention to what the message and the Bible is.

00:30:39.339 --> 00:30:48.339
These booklets and tracts expose the church's departure from Bible teachings, and they infuriated Christendom's clergy.

00:30:48.339 --> 00:30:54.619
Now this affected the money that was coming into many churches.

00:30:54.619 --> 00:30:58.619
Because once people saw the truth, they saw that they'd been taught falsehood.

00:30:58.619 --> 00:31:06.619
It was only logical that they would withdraw and would not give their support to religious institutions that were teaching falsehood.

00:31:06.619 --> 00:31:15.569
In 1903, Pittsburgh's Carnegie Hall became the scene of a six-day debate.

00:31:16.569 --> 00:31:24.569
E.L. Eaton, pastor of a Methodist Episcopal Church, and representing an alliance of Protestant clergymen, had one aim.

00:31:24.569 --> 00:31:32.569
To destroy Russell's influence, particularly with regard to his teachings about the condition of the dead.

00:31:32.569 --> 00:31:43.569
They really wanted to expose Russell as a man who was ignorant of the Bible and a fraud who wasn't qualified to get on a platform and preach about Bible subjects.

00:31:44.569 --> 00:31:55.569
Russell really did a very good job of presenting his arguments and establishing Bible truth showing he was very qualified to deal with Scripture.

00:31:55.569 --> 00:32:07.569
People had a chance not only to see the contrast between the two, but had a chance to see that Bible truths were clear on many of those points.

00:32:07.569 --> 00:32:18.569
It was reported that one clergyman who had been there to support Eaton came up to Russell afterward and said, I'm glad to see you turn the hose on hell and put the fire out.

00:32:18.569 --> 00:32:25.140
The local newspaper published a full account of each debate the following day.

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:34.140
And then the brothers got the idea, why not have Brother Russell have a sermon printed each week in the newspapers simultaneously.

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:42.140
And they in turn would telegraph the sermon out to all the newspapers in the United States, Canada, and even parts of Europe.

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:49.140
Russell's sermons could be found in 2000 newspapers reaching 15 million readers.

00:32:49.140 --> 00:33:02.359
The message was spreading quickly, but the Bible students were determined that it should penetrate to all corners of the earth.

00:33:02.359 --> 00:33:07.359
To that end, Russell prepared an even more intensive campaign.

00:33:07.359 --> 00:33:18.019
Up to 1908, the work had been directed from Russell's hometown, now a part of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

00:33:18.019 --> 00:33:28.970
But to accomplish a more extensive international work, the headquarters, known as the Bible House, were far too small.

00:33:31.339 --> 00:33:40.339
In 1908, Russell dispatched JF Rutherford and others to New York City to secure more suitable quarters.

00:33:40.339 --> 00:33:46.779
The place was named Bethel, meaning House of God.

00:33:46.779 --> 00:34:01.059
Those who lived there were called the Bethel family, each a volunteer, each working vigorously to shine the Bible's light into all the earth.

00:34:01.059 --> 00:34:09.059
As far back as 1891, Russell and some associates had been traveling to other lands to help people spiritually.

00:34:09.059 --> 00:34:12.059
Brothers, I would like to take our preaching worldwide.

00:34:12.059 --> 00:34:21.789
One 17,000-mile journey took them to Europe, Asia, and Africa.

00:34:22.789 --> 00:34:26.789
One of the results of that trip was this.

00:34:26.789 --> 00:34:32.789
There was a need seen for publications in various languages.

00:34:32.789 --> 00:34:38.789
Not long after he would visit a place, you could see these groups of Bible students start to spring up.

00:34:38.789 --> 00:34:41.789
The work was starting to go into national.

00:34:41.789 --> 00:34:50.789
But during the years 1909 through 1912, Russell intensified his efforts, traveling across Europe,

00:34:50.789 --> 00:35:01.739
the Middle East, and eventually around the world.

00:35:01.739 --> 00:35:14.329
His travels enabled him to observe millions of people.

00:35:14.329 --> 00:35:23.610
And to see firsthand what it would really mean to let the light of truth shine into all the earth.

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:48.340
By 1914, there were 5,000 Bible students preaching in 68 lands.

00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:55.860
The world's population was approaching 2 billion.

00:35:55.860 --> 00:36:02.260
Was there a way to reach more people in less time?

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:05.260
New technologies had opened up a possibility.

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:21.579
Four-fold grammar of creation is presented by the IBSA, the International Bible Student Association.

00:36:21.579 --> 00:36:26.579
Its age is public instruction along the literal scientific line,

00:36:26.579 --> 00:36:32.579
and is the page of the Bible as the entire Word of God.

00:36:32.579 --> 00:36:37.579
The Bible students did something that had never been done before.

00:36:37.579 --> 00:36:42.579
By synchronizing slides and film footage with music and dialogue,

00:36:42.579 --> 00:36:49.750
they produced an eight-hour audio-visual presentation.

00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:54.750
The idea was to show the development of God's purpose from the beginning of creation

00:36:54.750 --> 00:37:01.139
to the millennial reign of Christ.

00:37:01.139 --> 00:37:08.219
It was shown in two-hour segments over four nights.

00:37:08.219 --> 00:37:11.219
The first part dealt with each of the creative days,

00:37:11.219 --> 00:37:32.889
the flood of Noah's day, and the faith of Abraham.

00:37:32.889 --> 00:37:40.920
Part two showed scenes of God's dealings with ancient Israel,

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:57.119
from the Exodus through the reign of the Judean kings.

00:37:57.119 --> 00:38:02.659
The third segment dealt with the destruction of Solomon's Temple,

00:38:02.659 --> 00:38:22.849
and messianic prophecies and their fulfillment.

00:38:22.849 --> 00:38:29.179
In part four, viewers saw the story of the spread of Christianity,

00:38:29.179 --> 00:38:36.059
the persecution that resulted,

00:38:36.059 --> 00:38:46.269
and the huge populations yet to be reached with the Kingdom message.

00:38:46.269 --> 00:38:52.900
Showings were organized so that 80 cities could be served each day.

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:56.900
The Bible students themselves paid all expenses needed

00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:58.900
to rent suitable theaters.

00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:06.690
The photodrama of creation was a technical feat previously unmatched.

00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:16.639
It would be another decade before a full-length commercial film

00:39:16.639 --> 00:39:25.969
would combine music, synchronized dialogue, and color footage.

00:39:25.969 --> 00:39:33.320
In just one year,

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:45.380
nine million people around the earth had seen the photodrama of creation,

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:51.380
and many who saw it were convinced that they had discovered the path of increasing light.

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:18.750
In 1876, Russell had written an article in Bible Examiner and titled

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:21.750
Gentile Times. When did they end?

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:26.750
In which he stated that the seven times will end in 1914.

00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:35.820
Russell concluded, on the basis of the tree dream recorded in Daniel 4,

00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:39.820
that the dynasty that began with King David

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:44.820
would be restored 2,520 years after its overthrow.

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:53.309
During those years, no Davidic King would rule.

00:40:53.309 --> 00:40:58.309
The Bible students referred to that period as the Gentile Times.

00:40:58.309 --> 00:41:02.750
What would happen at the end of those years?

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:10.800
They reasoned that since Jesus is the only one qualified to assume the throne of David,

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:14.800
then Christ himself would begin ruling in 1914.

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:20.489
What would that mean for the earth?

00:41:20.489 --> 00:41:26.280
Reasoning on Daniel chapter 2 and Matthew chapter 24,

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:31.280
the Bible students preached that a time of global anarchy would come,

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:35.280
which would culminate in the end of the system of things.

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:40.280
They believed that around that time the congregation would be taken to heaven.

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:44.280
They realized that 1914 had a significance.

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:47.280
It meant the end of the Gentile Times.

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:51.280
Now at that time they felt that perhaps the work would be finished

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:54.280
and they would go home as it were.

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:57.280
So they were looking forward to a time of reward.

00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:01.280
They did understand that there was a significance to the year.

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:06.280
Primarily they thought that 1914 would just be the start of the judgment

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:09.280
coming upon the world or Armageddon.

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:16.059
Yet people in general were anticipating a different sort of future.

00:42:16.059 --> 00:42:23.690
Many who wrote memoirs about the summer of 1914

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:29.690
described it as one of exceptional tranquility, full of hope and promise.

00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:38.699
Some analysts felt that in 1914 conditions were better than ever for achieving world peace.

00:42:38.699 --> 00:42:48.360
What the Bible students had been preaching about global anarchy seemed highly unlikely.

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:55.360
But the Bible students counted the days and continued working.

00:42:55.360 --> 00:43:03.360
Then on June 28th, 1914, Austria-Hungary's crown prince and his wife were murdered.

00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:13.260
His assassin fired the shots that began the bloodiest war mankind had yet experienced.

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:36.369
Notions of tranquility were shattered as nation after nation became enmeshed in the Great War.

00:43:36.369 --> 00:43:56.949
These and other historical events matched what Jesus said would characterize the conclusion of the system of things.

00:43:56.949 --> 00:44:11.230
When World War I broke out in July, they felt indicated and it strengthened their faith in the Bible and in Jehovah's prophetic word.

00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:19.230
But also it enhanced their trust that Jehovah was using Brother Russell and his friends to explain truth to others.

00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:38.630
At Brooklyn Bethel, on October 2nd, 1914, Charles Russell made a monumental announcement.

00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:47.789
The Gentile times have ended. Their kings have had their day.

00:44:47.789 --> 00:44:56.789
Expectations were still running high. Many of the Bible students were hoping for an immediate heavenly reward.

00:44:56.789 --> 00:45:05.789
And I just see my mother, she was ready to sell up everything in the home because she thought that the end was coming in 1940.

00:45:05.789 --> 00:45:10.789
And her feelings were that of a lot of the brothers back there.

00:45:10.789 --> 00:45:23.460
Despite such expectations, the distressing world conditions that erupted in 1914 would not mean that the Bible students job was done.

00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:37.739
Russell felt sure that a great work remained. He wrote, we should lose no time dreaming that the door is shut.

00:45:37.739 --> 00:45:52.210
There are people who are seeking the truth. People who are sitting in darkness, the watchtower, February 15th, 1915.

00:45:52.210 --> 00:46:08.039
Yet Russell would not personally reach those people. In 1916, in the course of a preaching tour, he died at the age of 64.

00:46:08.039 --> 00:46:31.780
He had spent his entire fortune preaching the Bible's message, whereas the majority of the Bible students kept studying the Bible and sharing its message.

00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:51.750
Others simply could not overcome their disappointments. Disappointment that 1914 did not fulfill all their expectations, compounded by natural grief over Russell's death.

00:46:51.750 --> 00:47:05.019
Well, it was a big shock because they were used to his taking the lead and they figured he was going to take the lead until the Lord came and took them all to heaven.

00:47:05.019 --> 00:47:13.019
And they just didn't know what to do for a while. They were totally shocked as to how to carry on.

00:47:13.019 --> 00:47:26.730
Some would sever all association with the Bible students and attempt to draw others after them. What would happen to the Bible students?

00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:30.730
Would they disperse as if followers of Russell?

00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:44.679
This is not a work of man. This is a work of Jehovah God. It's evident that Jehovah had already chosen this organization.

00:47:44.679 --> 00:47:53.679
Because of the faithfulness and the sincerity of the man who were behind it, it's obvious that Jehovah had already chosen this organization to get his work done.

00:47:53.679 --> 00:48:03.679
There were enough honest-hearted men hungering for the truth, desirous of doing the will of God, to prevent the organization from collapsing.

00:48:03.679 --> 00:48:17.090
Rather than giving in to disappointment over what did not happen in 1914, the Bible students kept their minds open to the significance of what had taken place.

00:48:17.090 --> 00:48:29.409
The World War and its aftermath had become the world's shaking events proclaimed by Russell almost 40 years earlier.

00:48:29.409 --> 00:48:42.199
The Bible students were coming to the realization that Christ's presence began in 1914 and that the world's last days were underway.

00:48:42.199 --> 00:48:57.380
Two months after Russell's death, Joseph Rutherford was appointed to oversee the work. Rutherford had been a close associate of Russell.

00:48:57.380 --> 00:49:08.139
Traveling with him and speaking in his defense, like Russell, he believed that the good news had to be preached.

00:49:08.139 --> 00:49:21.650
He was dynamic and could not be intimidated, yet not everyone appreciated these traits, even among the Bible students.

00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:33.650
Brother Rutherford, he was an entirely different personality, brusque in manner and he didn't fear to tread on anyone's toes.

00:49:33.650 --> 00:49:45.650
I think this had a tremendous test on the brothers because they were really worshiping the creature, more than the creator.

00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:58.849
Rutherford directed that Russell's notes for a seventh volume of studies in the scriptures be compiled into a new book called The Finished Mystery.

00:49:58.849 --> 00:50:08.849
On the day that the book was completed and he had a supply in his office, he arranged for the brothers to put one at each table place in the dining room.

00:50:08.849 --> 00:50:14.849
And so when the family came down to eat, each one had a copy of the book The Finished Mystery.

00:50:14.849 --> 00:50:29.849
Some were quite curious about it and wondered what was all about and he enthused about it, but there was already a growing tension in the family because some of the responsible brothers sort of resented Brother Rutherford, some of them had ambitions for themselves.

00:50:29.849 --> 00:50:37.849
So they used the occasion to bring accusations against Brother Rutherford for having gone ahead and published this without their permission and their knowledge.

00:50:37.849 --> 00:50:49.469
And the result was eventually about a five-hour tirade against Brother Rutherford, where a number brought a lot of unjust accusations against him.

00:50:49.469 --> 00:50:56.469
Brother Macmillan tells it, well, that day they left the dining room and most of the food was uneaten and the family was very sad.

00:50:56.469 --> 00:51:02.469
But in the community at large, people were taking note of The Finished Mystery.

00:51:02.469 --> 00:51:16.000
They originally planned on a distribution of about less than 100,000 and within a short time over 850,000 copies had to be printed.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.000
The clergy hated the book.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:29.000
It exposed their unscriptural teachings and practices and it publicly condemned them for their involvement in the World War.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:38.369
The clergy fought back using the heightened patriotism of wartime to their advantage.

00:51:38.369 --> 00:51:49.369
They falsely accused the Bible students of sedition, espionage, and treason.

00:51:49.369 --> 00:52:00.079
And they urged the U.S. government to halt their work on May 8, 1918.

00:52:00.079 --> 00:52:04.079
Joseph Rutherford and seven of his associates were arrested.

00:52:04.079 --> 00:52:21.780
On June 20, they were convicted on four counts of sedition.

00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:34.360
July 4, 1918, Rutherford and his associates were transported to the Federal Penitentiary in Atlanta, Georgia.

00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:38.360
The sentence, 20 years in prison.

00:52:41.599 --> 00:53:18.469
George Fisher, Humak Miller, Robert Martin, Frederick Robison, Joseph Rutherford, William Van Amberg, Clayton Woodworth, sentenced to 10 years in prison, Giovanni de Checa.

00:53:18.469 --> 00:53:22.469
It was quite a shock to them to be put in prison.

00:53:22.469 --> 00:53:26.469
Did they do something that they shouldn't have done?

00:53:26.469 --> 00:53:30.469
Was the Lord displeased with them or was the Lord permitting it?

00:53:30.469 --> 00:53:32.469
They just didn't know.

00:53:32.469 --> 00:53:36.469
The devil stirs up people to a possessive directly or indirectly.

00:53:36.469 --> 00:53:43.469
Now, the charge of sedition has been one often used against Jehovah's people.

00:53:43.469 --> 00:53:45.469
This is just another ploy.

00:53:45.469 --> 00:53:51.469
Those brothers certainly were not going around trying to undermine the U.S. government.

00:53:52.469 --> 00:53:59.469
On August 26, 1918, Brooklyn headquarters was shut down.

00:53:59.469 --> 00:54:05.420
Operations were moved back to Pittsburgh.

00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:30.539
In the minds of the clergy, the voice of the Bible students had been silenced.

00:54:30.539 --> 00:54:46.960
On November 11, 1918, the World War ended.

00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:52.010
Prisoners of war were being released.

00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:56.010
Rutherford and his associates were not.

00:54:56.010 --> 00:55:02.599
It appeared that their opponents had succeeded.

00:55:02.599 --> 00:55:07.599
The Bible students circulated a petition for the release of the Eight Men

00:55:07.599 --> 00:55:13.199
and obtained 700,000 signatures.

00:55:13.199 --> 00:55:19.199
On March 12, 1919, Woodrow Wilson, president of the United States,

00:55:19.199 --> 00:55:23.800
conceded that the prison terms were excessive.

00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:27.800
On March 26, all Eight Men were released.

00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:30.800
The charges were later dropped.

00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:33.800
That the Lord was preparing them for the future.

00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:39.800
It was going to be a battle with the political, religious and commercial world

00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:46.800
and brother Rutherford was geared and trained for that after he got out.

00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:50.800
Upon their release, the men were consumed with zeal.

00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:55.800
Within six months, headquarters was moved back to Brooklyn

00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:59.800
and arrangements were made for a convention at Cedar Point, Ohio.

00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:08.500
It was here that they launched a companion magazine to the watchtower called The Golden Age.

00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:13.500
Its purpose, to explain the meaning of world events

00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:17.500
and to inspire hope in the Supreme Remedy.

00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:22.500
Rutherford and his associates had only just been released from prison

00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:28.500
and then within a couple of months, they organized this tremendous convention

00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:31.500
and announced the release of a new magazine, The Golden Age.

00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:35.500
Now, that's something that really is unbelievable.

00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:39.500
You go from one situation where there's hardly anything happening.

00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:43.500
The next thing, it's just full speed ahead.

00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:50.500
On September 8th, 1922, another convention was held at Cedar Point.

00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:56.500
Here, Rutherford gave what would become perhaps his most memorable speech.

00:56:56.500 --> 00:57:03.289
Do you believe that the King of glory has begun his reign?

00:57:03.289 --> 00:57:05.289
Yes!

00:57:05.289 --> 00:57:11.289
Then back to the field, the world must know that Jehovah is God

00:57:11.289 --> 00:57:17.289
and that Jesus Christ is King of kings and Lord of Lords.

00:57:17.289 --> 00:57:20.289
This is the day of all days.

00:57:20.289 --> 00:57:24.289
Rehold the King reigns.

00:57:24.289 --> 00:57:28.289
You are his publicity agents.

00:57:28.289 --> 00:57:38.760
Therefore, advertise, advertise, advertise the King and his kingdom.

00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:57.469
And advertise they did.

00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:05.960
Well, it must have been daunting for them to contemplate the world

00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:10.960
as their territory and a few thousand harvest workers.

00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:13.960
If they knew Jehovah would help them, they knew others would join them.

00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:15.960
So they knew the work would expand.

00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:18.960
You could imagine someone sitting there and saying,

00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:21.960
how on earth would you ever get this done?

00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:25.960
And that would seem to be quite a sensible question.

00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:27.960
But those brothers weren't concerned with that.

00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:29.960
They had full faith in Jehovah.

00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:33.960
Well, our focus at the time in view of Brother Rutherford's talk

00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:37.960
was that we've got something to do.

00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:41.960
And we've got to finish a work that we've been entrusted with.

00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:45.960
And our focus was to get on with the job

00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:49.960
and fulfill our commission as his servants here on the earth.

00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:52.960
Like some who had gone before them,

00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:58.960
these students of the Bible had the courage to walk away from false beliefs.

00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:05.969
Yet they were different in that they stuck together

00:59:05.969 --> 00:59:11.500
and they refused to stop preaching.

00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:15.500
Even in the face of serious opposition,

00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:21.000
because of their endurance,

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:24.000
they continued to know the profound joy

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:29.559
of having emerged from darkness.

00:59:29.559 --> 00:59:33.559
Now, a huge work lay ahead of them.

00:59:33.559 --> 00:59:39.610
Their future would be one of increasing sacrifice

00:59:39.610 --> 00:59:44.719
and great accomplishment.

00:59:44.719 --> 00:59:54.329
But their faith that Christ had begun ruling

00:59:54.329 --> 01:00:00.329
coupled with their appreciation for Jehovah's direction and backing

01:00:00.329 --> 01:00:04.329
gave them the courage they would need

01:00:04.329 --> 01:00:09.329
to let the light of truth shine into all the earth.
