00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:07.349
Now let's look at Philippians chapter 3, take a look at 13 and then a few other verses.

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:19.469
But in part verse 13 says, forgetting, forgetting the things behind and stretching forward to the things ahead.

00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:26.109
But we accidentally forget some things that we wish we could remember.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.149
Maybe a person's name and address a scripture.

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:33.240
We might even forget today's date.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.640
But to purposefully try to forget something is another matter.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:46.399
It seems the more that we try to forget it, the more we remember it.

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.759
Well, in the example in the scriptures might have noticed the way the scripture cited,

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:56.560
it starts out with, in brackets, I am forgetting.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.159
So that's the Apostle Paul.

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:06.799
So what did Paul intend when he said, forgetting the things behind?

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.040
Well first, let's look back at verses 5 and 6.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.840
His prestigious pedigree.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.519
He was an Israelite of the honored tribe of Benjamin.

00:01:16.519 --> 00:01:19.000
He was a Hebrew through and through.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.480
He was an educated esteemed Pharisee.

00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:24.239
And he scrupulously lived by the law.

00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:27.159
He said blamelessly.

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:32.319
Well, in verse 7, he then says, yet the things that were gains to me,

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:36.120
I've considered loss on the count of the Christ.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.359
But did he totally erase all that from his mind?

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:45.079
Did he literally forget that, the things behind?

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:46.959
Well, it doesn't seem to be the case.

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:52.159
In verses 5 and 6, he just rattled them off from memory.

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:55.760
So what does Paul mean when he says forgetting?

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.359
Well, the study note on this verse,

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:01.959
I said about the word translated forgetting

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:05.680
that it can mean unconcerned about it.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.680
Similarly, you possible Paul, he remembered those things.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.879
But you see, he was unconcerned about them now.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.039
He didn't care about them.

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:21.479
He was like a runner focused on the things I had.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.680
The finish line is heavenly hope.

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:29.520
Well, similarly, some have given up a lucrative career

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.400
to enter the full-time ministry.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.280
Do they remember that previous lifestyle?

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:39.280
Yes, but they don't dwell on it anymore.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.680
They're unconcerned about it.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.280
They're stretching forward for their spiritual goals ahead.

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:48.639
Now, second, what else did Paul not really forget,

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:51.639
but pushed to the back of his mind?

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.319
Now, unconcerned about it because he could not change it.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.960
A first Timothy 1, 12, through 16,

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.680
it was his former conduct toward Christians.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.759
He was ruthless.

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:07.840
He raided homes.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.479
He dragged brothers and sisters to the Sanhedrin for trial.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.639
Well, that was barbaric.

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:18.840
In fact, he describes himself in verse 13,

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.240
1 Timothy 1, 13, he says,

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.000
I was a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an insolent man.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And one scholar said that Greek word translated insolent

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.800
indicates a kind of arrogant sadism.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.599
He said, it describes the man who is out to inflict pain

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:40.000
for the sheer joy of inflicting it.

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.919
Saul was a zealous ruffian.

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:49.199
What did he forget that former conduct

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:50.879
were Jesus disciples?

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.479
No, he just told us about his former personality.

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:58.080
It likely pained him greatly,

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.080
but he could not change what happened.

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:05.479
So he changed himself and moved on,

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:08.080
stretching forward to the things that had confident

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:12.560
that based on Jesus' ransom, Jehovah forgave him

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.960
and loved him for who he was now

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.600
and what he was able to do for the truth.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.399
I like Paul some of our brothers and sisters

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:23.399
did despicable things before coming into the truth.

00:04:25.079 --> 00:04:30.040
They can't change that, but they did change themselves

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.600
and praying for forgiveness in Jesus' name.

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.279
They now are Jehovah's precious sheep,

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:39.120
finally able to put it behind them

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.790
and like a runner, stretch forward to their future reward.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.870
Now thirdly, how else did Paul need

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.670
to implement this principle

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:55.350
for getting the things behind and moving forward?

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.149
Was he perfect after his conversion to Christianity?

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.629
Nothing more than he needed to try to forget

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:03.790
the things behind.

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.870
Well, that doesn't seem to be so.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.709
Please, Romans chapter seven.

00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:13.509
And I might add, this is just a little over 20 years

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:16.949
after Paul saw the light and became a Christian.

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:21.949
So 20 years as a Christian, did he try to forget some things

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:25.029
during those intervening years as a Christian?

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:29.389
Well, think about it, Paul was a prominent apostle.

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:31.430
It's true, Jehovah loved him,

00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:35.750
but he was imperfect and at times,

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.949
he evidently succumbed to imperfection.

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:44.139
Romans seven, 21 to 23.

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:47.100
I find that on this law, in my case,

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.060
when I wish to do what is right,

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.420
what is bad is present with me.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.139
I really delight in the law of God

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:58.779
according to the man who I am within.

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:01.819
But I see in my body another law

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:03.420
worrying against the law of my mind

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:08.420
and leading me captive to sin's law that is in my body.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.019
We can be sure that Paul did not get involved

00:06:14.019 --> 00:06:16.300
in a serious, gross wrongdoing.

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:22.100
Nevertheless, he admits he still had a degree of sin

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.100
within him imperfection.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.779
In fact, if you look back up there,

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:31.290
Romans seven, verse 14 and 15,

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.610
for we know that the law is spiritual.

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.730
Paul says, but I am fleshly sold under sin.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.250
For I do not understand what I am doing.

00:06:43.329 --> 00:06:45.689
For I do not practice what I wish,

00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:50.050
but I do what I hate.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.089
Well, don't you too hate it

00:06:52.089 --> 00:06:54.810
when imperfection sneaks up and bites you.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.850
You done or said something, you do not wish.

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:00.649
And maybe you've even hurt a brother

00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:02.410
now in the process.

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.569
But we call the account in Acts chapter 15

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:09.529
where Paul and Barnum has had a serious disagreement over Mark.

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:11.490
And 39 of that chapter says,

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:16.490
at this, there was a sharp, sharp burst of anger

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:21.089
so that they, as Christians, separated from each other

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:23.329
at least for a time.

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:28.779
Do you think Paul was happy about that incident?

00:07:28.779 --> 00:07:30.379
Likely not.

00:07:30.379 --> 00:07:33.699
In fact, when he detected imperfection within him

00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:38.019
at Romans 724, he said, miserable,

00:07:38.019 --> 00:07:40.220
miserable man that I am.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.339
Paul felt miserable.

00:07:43.339 --> 00:07:46.259
And no doubt afterward, he was sorry

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.220
that the conversation escalated to that point,

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.180
that calm thinking did not prevail

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:57.899
on either his or Barnabas part, but it happened.

00:07:58.939 --> 00:08:00.860
And words cannot be retracted.

00:08:01.939 --> 00:08:03.019
Well, the Bible doesn't say,

00:08:03.019 --> 00:08:06.100
but afterwards Paul may have agonized over that incident

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.660
for weeks.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.579
Even after we apologize for something,

00:08:10.579 --> 00:08:12.939
that we've said that we did not wish,

00:08:13.939 --> 00:08:15.699
we still might feel guilty.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:23.689
And it can rehearse it over and over in our minds.

00:08:23.689 --> 00:08:27.009
In English, there's a medical abbreviation,

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:31.970
DNR, it means do not resuscitate.

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:36.809
A terminal patient's hopeless condition cannot be changed.

00:08:38.129 --> 00:08:40.370
So if he stops breathing,

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:43.570
there will be no heroic efforts to revive him.

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:49.690
Well, even after a person apologizes for what he did not wish,

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:53.529
it can still invade his thinking on a daily basis.

00:08:53.529 --> 00:08:54.809
So what can you do?

00:08:56.450 --> 00:09:01.210
Philippians 313, forgetting the things behind.

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:03.330
Now, we don't actually forget it,

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.169
but based on the ransom sacrifice of Jesus,

00:09:06.169 --> 00:09:08.850
which is certainly big enough to cover our mistake,

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:10.330
we choose DNR.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:14.809
We don't breathe life back into that event.

00:09:14.809 --> 00:09:16.769
We don't try to revive it.

00:09:18.049 --> 00:09:21.210
At some point, we just have to let it go.

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:26.049
DNR do not rehearse in your mind,

00:09:26.049 --> 00:09:27.690
but happened over and over.

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:32.289
Instead, do your level best to serve Jehovah whole soul.

00:09:32.289 --> 00:09:35.330
And like Paul, learn from the incident,

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:38.370
but don't let it paralyze your spiritual progress.

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:44.370
Like a runner, stretch forward to the things ahead.
