00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:15.279
My experience with bullying ultimately started in physical education when this kid who

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:20.480
shared a locker a few spaces away from me took that opportunity and started to verbally

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.480
attack me.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.079
I first experienced bullying in elementary school but it was a little stuff.

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:36.079
Nothing too big in middle school was when it was really really something.

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:42.880
It was upsetting that I was being bullied, it made me feel like I was doing something

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.380
wrong.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.880
Why did I have to be the target?

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.880
It got really personal.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.079
He'd call me names, he would say that you know it wasn't good at anything.

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.679
No one cared about me, that I was dumb, that I was weak, especially after he found out

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:00.079
that I was a witness and the text just got even more intense.

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.600
It was one day specifically that was really bad.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.560
It started in a classroom.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:12.920
I heard one girl talk to another girl about me right in front of me and these were lies.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.480
We went to lunch and I was cornered again.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.159
Is this how middle school is going to be?

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:24.159
I don't have anybody to be with to hang out with during school because everybody doesn't

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:25.159
like me.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.439
No one liked me, it was the worst day ever.

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.959
I no longer felt that I was valuable at that point.

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:38.719
I was starting to feel more that I was this weak person, that I was defenseless and that

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:44.200
I had no one cared about me and that I was worthless to anybody so hearing that over

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.799
and over really took a toll on my mental health and my emotional health.

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:52.079
I think at my lowest point after receiving so many of these vicious attacks, I started

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.400
to have really dark feelings and I realized that I shouldn't let this go any further than

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.200
it already is.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.760
That was the moment when I knew I had to get help.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:07.719
I told my parents about it of course and especially on the worst day I told them everything.

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:14.319
My parents always brought up scriptures, Proverbs 27-12, any time I saw the bullies I would

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.599
avoid as much as possible.

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:22.080
The other thing that I was always doing was praying constantly, always praying before

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.319
school, during school, after school, there were times that would go into the library and

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:34.960
just read books, just stayed in myself during those times I would also pray to Jehovah

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.840
and he was a friend to me, he was somebody that I could speak to on this matter.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.039
I did end up talking to my parents about it.

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:46.120
Let me get my side of the story out, they were listening and they wanted to help out

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.759
and they made me feel loved.

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:56.280
I definitely took this time to reach out to the elders and they really encouraged me and

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.360
assured me that I was not only somewhere I was needed, I was also somewhere where I

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.439
was wanted.

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:10.719
I took some practical steps, I moved my locker, I made sure I had to retaliate.

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:15.159
Walk away is something very powerful, retaliation is something that's weak because you're giving

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:17.840
into your emotions and you're just lashing out.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:24.120
Eventually the bully got suspended, which gave me some peace, I ended up coming back

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.719
after a week and he started up again with the attack.

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:31.360
I noticed that he hadn't changed at all but I had.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.599
I was much more confident with that change, I began to fear him less, I wasn't scared

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.000
of him, I just saw him as this person who wanted attention from me.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.960
All the principles that she read about with the young people, the scriptures that she

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:50.000
picked out, everything really, really helps and you can either see the situation die

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.599
down or it's not as bad, you can deal with it or it just stops and it was so encouraging

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:03.599
for me and it helped strengthen my faith in seeing how Jehovah really is there to help.

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.719
Don't keep this to yourself, don't bottle it up because that'll make things worse.

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:12.479
This is a problem that won't go away because you ignore it.

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:16.639
You need to talk to someone, talk to your parents, talk to your friend, talk to Jehovah,

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.839
talk to someone of congregation because if you don't know what to do, they'll help you

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:25.339
find out what to do and they'll give you guidance and you'll be so impressed by how

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:29.600
much Jehovah takes care of you and they'll show you that you are loved by him.
