00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:08.880
My lord, he has rejected your offer for a fourth time.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:18.160
Gisham, it's time to implement your plan.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.160
Tobaya, write this down.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.160
Among the nations, it has been heard.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.160
And Gisham is also saying that you and the Jews

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.159
are scheming to rebel.

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:37.159
That is why you are building the wall.

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.649
Yes?

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:23.879
Give this to Nehemiah.

00:01:23.879 --> 00:01:24.879
Tell your master.

00:01:24.879 --> 00:01:27.879
None of the things you are saying have taken place.

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:51.709
You are making them up out of your own imagination.

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:53.709
They're bluffing.

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:56.709
They're trying to frighten us in the stopping the work.

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:00.709
Yes, they know that the king won't change his decree.

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:28.639
But believe me, they won't stop.

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:37.039
Jehovah, I pray strengthen my hands.

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:40.039
What can we do to stop him?

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:42.039
We don't have much time.

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:45.039
The wall is almost complete.

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:52.960
San Ballet.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.960
I think I know a way.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.960
Shemaya, you call for me?

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.580
Yes.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.580
You are in great danger.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.580
And so am I, because I know about it.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.580
Talk sense, man. What danger?

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.580
They're coming to kill you.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.580
By night, we must go into the temple and close the doors.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.580
Shemaya, should a man like me run away?

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.580
You don't understand.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.580
No.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.580
What would that do to the spirit of the entire nation?

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.580
It's the only safe place.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.580
Besides, I'm not a priest.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.580
If I entered the temple, that would be valid reason to kill me.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.580
I will not go in.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.580
That decision would be foolish, Nehemiah.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:44.169
Oh, I see.

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:47.169
Tobiah and San Ballet put you up to this.

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:49.169
Didn't they, you hypocrite?

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:51.169
May Jehovah remember them.

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:55.169
And all of you false prophets who keep trying to frighten me.

00:03:55.169 --> 00:04:15.379
Come, Henei, we have work to do.

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:18.379
We just kept working day and night.

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:23.379
But before we knew it, we were finishing the very last section of the wall.

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:50.410
The impossible.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.410
He discovered something we had lost.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:05:08.620
It's two days.
