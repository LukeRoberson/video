00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:10.699
Far from Israel lived a Jew whom the king of Persia trusted with his life.

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:17.699
He believed his people were carrying on pure worship in Jerusalem until one day.

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:27.350
The walls of Jerusalem are broken down and its gates have been burned with fire.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:33.100
Most of the people ignore God's law.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:46.500
Walls was only the beginning.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.500
We have many powerful enemies.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.500
I recommend you turn the accusation of sedition against Nehemiah.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.500
Nehemiah is far away in Shushan.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.500
Who is going to tell him?

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.500
This is my province.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.500
Out here, I decide what to do.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.500
I have a right to live where I choose and so do you.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.500
They would need help to face what was about to come next.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.500
Every man must find his own joy and I intend to find mine.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.739
Why should you complain when everyone else approves?

00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:21.739
If we let mere threats frighten us in the stopping, they will have achieved their goal.

00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:24.739
Are you going to wait until they start killing us?

00:01:24.739 --> 00:01:26.739
We're powerless to stop this.

00:01:26.739 --> 00:01:32.170
Do you remember me favorably?

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.170
Oh my God.
