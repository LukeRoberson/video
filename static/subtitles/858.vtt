00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:14.779
It was 140 years ago, in 1884, when Zion's watchtower track society was legally incorporated.

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:19.699
Now I know there are many great beards here, but I understand that none of you were present

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:23.500
on that occasion.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.660
That's reassuring.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.179
It was just as Zechariah chapter 4 and verse 10 says.

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:37.179
It was a day of small beginnings, really just a handful.

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:44.659
But what has Jehovah accomplished in the field in the last 140 years?

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:52.539
Today we have nearly 9 million who are preaching the good news of God's kingdom in some 240

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:58.140
lands and with publications in more than 1,000 languages.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:17.140
Brothers, aren't we moved to glorify Jehovah for what he has accomplished?

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.620
But how did we get to this point?

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.939
And what has been a major factor in the global expansion that Jehovah's organization has

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:27.700
experienced?

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.859
And what opportunities are open in the field for our young ones?

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:36.269
Please watch.

00:01:36.269 --> 00:01:41.030
When you think of a missionary, perhaps you think of someone older who has been preaching

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:43.989
for many years.

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:49.269
But of course, many were very young when they started.

00:01:49.269 --> 00:01:55.989
In fact, in the mid to late 1940s, 30% of the missionaries sent from Gilead were under

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:58.230
24 years of age.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:04.950
They were young, energetic, full of life, willing to accept assignments around the world,

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.870
and they accomplished incredible things.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:14.389
For instance, in 1943, we were preaching in 54 lands and the number of publishers was

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:16.789
still relatively small.

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:19.710
Jehovah blessed their hard work and zeal.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.750
In just five years, the number of publishers worldwide nearly doubled.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:32.750
By 1953, it had doubled again and the reach of Jehovah's organization expanded to 143

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.789
lands.

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:40.909
At 10-year burst of activity, laid the foundation for Jehovah's organization to grow into what

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:42.789
it has become today.

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:52.099
Over 8 million people spread across 239 lands, reaching billions with the truth.

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:57.139
Young missionaries have directly contributed to the fulfillment of Jesus' words, preaching

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:03.099
the good news of the kingdom for a witness to all the nations.

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.099
Over 80 years have passed.

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:17.039
Perhaps you're thinking, is there still a need for missionaries today?

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:18.840
What do the facts show?

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.360
We see tremendous growth and potential for more growth around the world.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.840
What has happened just during the past service year?

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:35.960
Mozambique had an all-time peak in memorial attendance of well over 400,000.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.800
It's more than four times the number of publishers in that land.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.199
Angola averaged over 900 new missionaries a month.

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:48.000
Excuse me, new publishers a month.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.879
That's a lot, wow.

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:59.560
The Congo branch averaged more than 1,300 new publishers a month and in Philippines

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:06.639
on average more than 1,000 were baptized every month.

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:11.479
Or brothers and sisters, in these places that are experiencing rapid growth, there is

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:15.319
a huge need for more missionaries.

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:17.879
But there are also needs in other lands.

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:23.920
Many countries have been blessed to have long-time missionaries who have done excellent work.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.920
But many of those faithful ones have now passed on.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.199
Researchers have had to leave their assignments because of having to care for aging relatives

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:35.800
or because of their own health challenges.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.079
So here's the question, is there still a need for missionaries today?

00:04:41.079 --> 00:04:44.879
The answer is absolutely yes.

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:52.439
There is a tremendous work to be accomplished in the world in missionary service and enthusiastic

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:58.560
and zealous young people are still being sent out every year to serve as missionaries.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:05.959
For example, recently the service committee sent 36 new missionaries to Madagascar and

00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:07.959
10 to Latvia.

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:12.879
Well now how do these young missionaries feel about their privilege of service?

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:17.399
Let's watch.

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:22.680
Our main preacher need at the moment in Madagascar is training of new ones.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.839
We have new publishers who are not even baptized yet, have in progressive Bible studies.

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:33.399
We were very happy to receive new young missionaries being assigned.

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:37.800
We now branched committee learned that we will get some new missionaries to Latvia.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.519
We were really thrilled.

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:44.040
We were three years special pioneers and later we received this letter.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.480
I was thinking Latvia, what do you know about Latvia?

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:53.000
My legs was thrombling but then I say, it's exciting.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.319
For me it's still like a dream and sometimes I'm asking friends, is it really real?

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:05.879
I was expecting maybe somewhere in Africa and they said, no, no, you will have beautiful

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:06.879
snow.

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:11.319
We really felt these new missionaries invigorating the field, their enthusiasm is really

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:13.120
pushing the work forward.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.720
Now many publishers are more active in service and by any spirit is increasing.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.600
I thought you was blessing in our assignment especially by the children in our congregation.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.720
And they hug you, you feel like home and the language doesn't matter anymore.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:33.319
I love my missionary assignment because it has opened my eyes to something beautiful.

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:36.800
The ministry is simply amazing.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.920
Being a missionary is something special but on the other hand it's quite a normal Christian

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.240
life focused on the preaching and enjoy everyday life.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:52.519
It's okay to be afraid to have doubts but give your whole world a chance.

00:06:52.519 --> 00:06:56.439
Being a missionary is the biggest experience in my life.

00:06:56.439 --> 00:07:01.399
My assignment strength and my spirituality because now I know I'm not afraid of more difficult

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:02.399
tasks.

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:16.339
I agree.

00:07:16.339 --> 00:07:21.860
So we need many more young people to take up missionary service.

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.980
Well that raises the question, how do you become a missionary?

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:30.579
Well the first step is to enter full-time service and then after you've been in full-time

00:07:30.579 --> 00:07:34.420
service for two years what do you need to do?

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:39.220
You need to apply for the school for kingdom evangelizers.

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:43.740
SKE is the door to missionary service.

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:49.420
You also need to have the spirit of Isaiah when he said, here I am, send me willing to go

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:52.779
wherever the organization might assign you.

00:07:52.779 --> 00:07:58.220
After you graduate SKE you could receive an assignment to serve as a temporary special

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:03.060
pioneer in your home country so that you can gain experience.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:08.939
And if you do well in that assignment you could receive an assignment to serve as a missionary

00:08:08.939 --> 00:08:11.220
in another country.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:17.420
Missionary service is a thrilling opportunity to bring the good news to honest-hearted people

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:19.860
in another part of the world.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:26.379
We need young people who want to go and make disciples of people of all the nations.

00:08:26.379 --> 00:08:37.899
Well how old do you need to be to apply for the school for kingdom evangelizer?

00:08:37.899 --> 00:08:43.539
Well we're very pleased to announce today that the governing body has decided that young

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:52.019
brothers and sisters 21 years of age or older may now apply to attend SKE.

00:08:52.019 --> 00:09:09.039
Isn't that exciting and wonderful?

00:09:09.039 --> 00:09:13.600
But many of you young ones right now are serving where the need is greater.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.639
Perhaps even in another country that's wonderful.

00:09:17.639 --> 00:09:24.080
But we encourage you now to apply for the school for kingdom evangelizers.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:29.919
You see this will allow the organization to see where you could best be used in the

00:09:29.919 --> 00:09:32.240
worldwide field.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:39.120
Young brothers and sisters please seize this wonderful opportunity.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.759
But what about those of us who are a bit older?

00:09:42.759 --> 00:09:48.279
What can we do to help these young people?

00:09:48.279 --> 00:09:54.120
Let's be generous in training them and in sharing with them our experience.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:10:00.000
Let's help them to grow and encourage them to reach out for these wonderful opportunities

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.919
to glorify Jehovah.

00:10:02.919 --> 00:10:11.440
When I was just 19 years old a brother invited me to attend my very first annual meeting.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.039
It was a special one.

00:10:13.039 --> 00:10:20.919
The 100th anniversary of the Watchtower Bible and Track Society held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

00:10:20.919 --> 00:10:35.580
I was so excited I thought I died and went to heaven.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:42.100
I couldn't believe that that brother would invite me to attend when I was so young.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:48.299
But the encouragement from that experience has stayed with me right up until this very

00:10:48.299 --> 00:10:50.139
moment.

00:10:50.139 --> 00:10:53.299
Brothers and sisters, what will you do?

00:10:53.299 --> 00:10:58.779
What will you do to encourage a young person to glorify Jehovah?

00:10:58.779 --> 00:11:05.539
Certainly, Jehovah will bless you if you look for ways to do so.

00:11:05.539 --> 00:11:09.220
Well, the preaching work is more urgent than ever before.

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:13.500
Will you read with me Romans chapter 10, please?

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:18.779
Romans chapter 10 and verse 13.

00:11:18.779 --> 00:11:23.419
It says, for everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved.

00:11:23.419 --> 00:11:28.580
However, how will they call on him if they have not put faith in him?

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:32.980
How in turn will they put faith in him about whom they have not heard?

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:37.580
How in turn will they hear without someone to preach?

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:42.620
How in turn will they preach unless they have been sent out?

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:49.980
Just as it is written, how beautiful are the feet of those who declare good news of

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.740
good things?

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:57.379
We need young ones, as verse 15 says, to be sent out to preach the good news.

00:11:57.379 --> 00:12:01.860
We need young ones to serve us pioneers and special pioneers and missionaries.

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:07.379
We need them to apply for the school for kingdom evangelizers.

00:12:07.379 --> 00:12:13.379
So Jehovah has accomplished an amazing work over these past 140 years.

00:12:13.379 --> 00:12:17.059
He's blessed the day of small beginnings.

00:12:17.059 --> 00:12:22.019
But brothers and sisters, the work is not over yet.

00:12:22.019 --> 00:12:36.070
Do you agree?

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:39.629
There are exciting opportunities for our beautiful young people.

00:12:39.629 --> 00:12:42.190
So young ones, what will you do?

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:47.389
You can now apply for Bethel and construction service at age 18.

00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:52.309
You can apply for the school for kingdom evangelizers at age 21.

00:12:52.309 --> 00:12:55.110
Put yourself in Jehovah's hands.

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:56.909
Make yourself available.

00:12:56.909 --> 00:12:59.230
You will never regret it.

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:05.710
And may we as older ones do everything in our power to encourage and train these young

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:06.710
people.

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:12.149
Yes, as Brother Loche said, let's keep polishing those mirrors.

00:13:12.149 --> 00:13:18.470
Let's keep looking for ways to expand our ministry and to glorify our wonderful, amazing

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:19.750
God, Jehovah.
