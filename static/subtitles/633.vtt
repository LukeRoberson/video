00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:08.449
Now, our text today reminds us how faithful ones eagerly anticipate the outworking of Jehovah's

00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:09.449
purpose.

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:16.370
But to get the full sense of this text, let's open and read Revelation chapter 22, verse

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.839
20 and its entirety.

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:29.120
It says, the one who bears witness of these things says, yes, I am coming quickly.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:35.679
And then in response, the Apostle John says, amen, come, Lord Jesus.

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:42.560
Well, here we see John's words are preceded by the powerful statement made by Jesus.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.159
Yes, I am coming quickly.

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:50.119
Well, what does it mean and how do we benefit from it today?

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:56.960
Well, the expression I am coming quickly here refers to Jesus appearing in the future to

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.759
reward those who are righteous and punish the wicked.

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:06.840
Now, this expression is mentioned some six times in the entire book of Revelation with

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.159
three of those instances in chapter 22 alone.

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:20.290
For example, look at verse 7, and there we see Jesus saying, look, I am coming quickly.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.769
Happy as anyone observing the words of the prophecy of this scroll.

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:33.890
And then in verse 12, we see Jehovah expressing his purpose when he says, look, I am coming quickly.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.650
And the reward I give is with me to repay each one according to his work.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.849
So putting this all together, what do we see?

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:48.930
We see the emphasis is on that Jesus is coming quickly.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.489
And so what do we take away from that?

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.930
Well, this is given in the very last chapter of the very last of the 66 books.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.650
So it's something important to Jehovah.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.730
It's something important to Jesus.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.090
We need to take it to heart.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.530
It reminds us of a lesson of a good conclusion that we learned years ago in the Theocratic

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.129
ministry school.

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:16.539
What you say last is often remembered first.

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:20.580
But how can we keep Jesus coming closely in mind?

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.020
We're going to discuss three ways we can do that.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:30.539
The first way is to remain positive despite changing circumstances.

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:35.860
Many of our brothers are facing deteriorating conditions due to this system of things.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.460
We think about the wars that are going on.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.259
We think about civil unrest.

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:43.659
We think about the natural disasters.

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:48.180
Some of our brothers in Russia and Eritrea face additional pressures.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.419
They face persecution.

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:52.060
So some have lost their jobs.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.979
They've had their assets frozen.

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:59.939
Some have even been beaten and imprisoned for their faith.

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:03.500
Now we know that the great tribulation is soon in hand.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.419
What's going to happen then?

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:08.860
Well we know that things will only get worse.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.539
In fact, the watchtower has said that we may experience hardships and deprivations of

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:17.060
various kinds.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:24.659
So the question is, how can we remain positive despite discouraging circumstances?

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:29.939
Well we have to keep in mind that we know that Jesus is coming quickly.

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:33.699
In other words, we know how the story ends.

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:37.740
For example, think about what's going to happen very soon.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:43.099
Satan's visible organization is going to have an expiration date.

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:46.740
It's going to be destroyed at the battle of Armageddon.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.939
And at that time, we know that this system is going to be destroyed.

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:56.580
It's not going to last one day longer than it's necessary.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.340
So in other words, relief is on the way.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.659
But let's look at another momentous event that is coming up.

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:13.259
Please turn with me to Revelation, chapter 20, and we'll look at verse 10.

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:18.500
And it says, and the devil who was misleading them was hurled into the lake of fire and

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.939
sawpher, where both the wild beasts and the false prophet already were, and they will

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:28.620
be tormented day and night forever and ever.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:34.220
Well being tossed into that lake of fire means that the devil will cease to exist.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.459
He will never, ever come back to life.

00:04:38.459 --> 00:04:40.459
Well that's going to be a happy day.

00:04:40.459 --> 00:04:45.699
And he's going to join those that preceded him, the wild beasts, the political systems

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:53.139
of this world and the false prophet, the Anglo-American world power that was destroyed at Armageddon.

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:59.939
But just think, the ugly head of the snake will be crushed forever.

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:01.420
That's something to look forward to.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.939
Satan's reign of terror will be over.

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:08.540
All suffering will end.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.980
But that's not the most important thing.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:19.660
The most important thing is that God's name, Jehovah, that holy name will finally be sanctified.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.740
Yes, it will be clear to a slander, reproach, lies, and misrepresentation that have been

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.459
heaped on it over the last 6,000 years.

00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:34.300
But let's look at a second benefit that we're going to get from Jesus coming quickly.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:42.720
Turn with me please to Revelation, chapter 22, and we'll look at verse 1 and 2.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:49.439
And he that is the angel showed me, John, a river of water of life, clear as crystal flowing

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:55.360
out from the throne of God and of the Lamb, down the middle of its main street.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.399
On both sides of the river were trees of life producing 12 crops of fruit, yielding their

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:06.800
fruit each month, and the leaves of the trees were for the healing of the nations.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.560
Well countless blessings will be poured out on mankind like a river.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:17.480
The river of water of life represents Jehovah's provisions through Jesus, forgiving everlasting

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.399
life to obedient mankind.

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:27.000
It comes from the throne of Jehovah and Jesus, and it comes right through New Jerusalem,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.240
the main street of New Jerusalem.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:35.480
Well, what blessings do you personally look forward to?

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:41.439
Well it's good for us to count the countless blessings that Jehovah is going to give us.

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:47.600
Now so many of us have been dealing with health concerns of one kind or another.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:54.319
Now for some of us it's just been aches and pains, and then others have things more serious.

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:58.959
And if it's not us, it may be a family member or a close friend.

00:06:58.959 --> 00:07:04.160
But let's think about also the pandemic that we went through, all of us are more sensitive

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:10.480
to our frailties, and some of us are still dealing with the strain of the emotional

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.639
and of mental stress of that pandemic.

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:21.720
But notice what it says in the second part of verse 2, that there will be trees of life

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.199
with leaves for healing.

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:31.399
Well that assures us that during the millennium, all illnesses, physical, mental and emotional,

00:07:31.399 --> 00:07:33.720
will be healed permanently.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:41.279
The fact that Watchtower has promised us or suggested that immediately after Armageddon,

00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:47.639
survivors can expect the miraculous healing so that they can move forward with zest, looking

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:53.319
eagerly to the marvelous activity of the millennium, not dragged down by the afflictions of the

00:07:53.319 --> 00:07:54.319
old world.

00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:58.959
Well, another glorious day is before us, isn't it?

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:04.000
Now let's look at a third point that we can take away from Jesus coming quickly.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.800
It helps us to carry out our work with a sense of urgency.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:11.399
Revelation chapter 22 verse 17.

00:08:11.399 --> 00:08:17.199
And the spirit and the bride keep on saying, come, and let anyone hearing say, come, and

00:08:17.199 --> 00:08:23.759
let anyone thirsting come, let anyone who wishes take life's water free.

00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:29.759
Now move by God's spirit, we see the anointed, along with the support from the other sheep

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:33.559
zealously share life giving truth with others.

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:38.240
And what a privilege each of us has to be able to do our very best, according to our

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.440
circumstances and this important work.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:47.639
But since the organization has adjusted our way of reporting service, could some think

00:08:47.639 --> 00:08:53.240
that now they could let the foot off the gas and slow down when it comes to this important

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.240
work?

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:57.440
Well, that's not the right thinking.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:02.080
Remember Jesus is coming quickly, so really it's full steam ahead.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:09.720
We're doing the very best that we can under these circumstances, according to our circumstances.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:14.879
What we call at the last annual meeting, we were reminded that the witnessing work that

00:09:14.879 --> 00:09:21.440
we are doing now will have perhaps even greater importance after the great tribulation starts.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:26.960
Now so, well some who see the destruction of Babylon agreed, where we call that Jehovah's

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:33.799
Witnesses are spoken of this event all along and perhaps they may have a change of heart.

00:09:33.799 --> 00:09:35.519
So what does that teach us?

00:09:35.519 --> 00:09:42.600
We have to maintain a sense of urgency, we have to keep preaching.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:48.320
So did you get those three points that we take away from Jesus coming quickly?

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.559
We have to remain positive despite changing circumstances.

00:09:52.559 --> 00:09:58.960
We have to make sure that we count our countless blessings and then third we have to stay busy

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.759
in the ministry.

00:10:00.759 --> 00:10:06.279
Well the Apostle John eagerly anticipated God's advancing purpose and we do too, so like

00:10:06.279 --> 00:10:10.639
John, we say amen, come Lord Jesus.
