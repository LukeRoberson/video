00:00:00.690 --> 00:01:05.980
In a marriage, not applying Bible principles can lead to a lack of peace, as time passes.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:13.090
The differences in opinion and personality that arise can undermine the peace you once

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.129
had.

00:01:17.129 --> 00:01:24.510
How can that peace so long for be regained?

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.489
Isaiah chapter 26 and verse 3 says,

00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:32.329
You will safeguard those who fully lean on you.

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:39.689
You will give them continuous peace because it is in you that they trust.

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.370
Only Jehovah can give continuous peace to those who fully lean on him.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:51.530
Abraham and Sarah, for example, had that peace because even during big life changes and

00:01:51.530 --> 00:02:08.400
difficult situations, they faithfully followed Jehovah's direction.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:16.120
We can demonstrate our trust in Jehovah by searching out his advice and his word.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:29.080
The Bible, turning Bible reading into a habit can seem daunting, but it is worth the effort.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.400
Take advantage of every opportunity.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.039
See where you can make adjustments in your routine.

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:41.960
The advice found in the Bible can lead to peace in your marriage.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.759
For example, Matthew chapter 7 and verse 12 says,

00:02:45.759 --> 00:03:06.460
All things, therefore, that you want men to do to you, you also must do to them.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:12.099
But after reading, don't forget the most important steps.

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.620
Apply what you learn.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:21.259
When a husband puts his wife's interest ahead of his own, she feels loved and valued and

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:36.159
vice versa.

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:41.360
Your Bible principle found at Matthew chapter 5 and verse 5 says,

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:55.349
Happy are the mild tempered.

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:06.069
By controlling our temper, we create an environment that is relaxed and peaceful.

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:12.949
And while all are encouraged to read the Bible as individuals, if circumstances allow,

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:15.909
consider doing so as a couple.

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:19.069
Talk about what you learned.

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:23.949
Take advantage of the available study tools to learn all you can about Jehovah's marvelous

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:28.660
qualities.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:35.660
Without a doubt, this will draw you closer to Jehovah and will strengthen the threefold

00:04:35.660 --> 00:05:10.910
cord in your marriage.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:22.360
And even when life takes a turn and things get hard, you will still be able to feel the

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:34.759
continuous peace that only Jehovah, the originator of marriage, can provide.

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:40.560
