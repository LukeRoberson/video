00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.580
Imagine for a moment that you're planning a road trip.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.580
You have everything you need.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.580
A map, a car, and plenty of fuel.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.579
Before you start the engine, though, you need to know your destination, wouldn't you agree?

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:22.579
If you don't know where you're trying to go, you won't know which road to take.

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:28.579
The same is true of our ministry, which is, in a sense, like that road trip.

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:37.579
As Acts 1348 shows, we're always searching for those who are rightly disposed for ever-lasting life.

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:44.579
We have everything we need for the journey, including all the tools in our teaching toolbox.

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.579
But what would you say is our destination?

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.579
What's the most important goal that we're trying to accomplish in our ministry?

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.579
Is it placing literature?

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:09.579
Directing people to JW.org, making return visits, starting Bible studies, educating people about the Bible,

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:16.579
or making disciples of Christ Jesus and baptizing them.

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:22.579
Each of those goals has value, but which one is our primary goal?

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:25.579
What's the destination that we want to reach?

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:32.579
Jesus identified it at Matthew, chapter 28, and verses 19 and 20.

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:46.579
There he said, go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:52.579
teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:57.579
Our destination, then, is a baptized disciple.

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:12.580
Each person we meet, each piece of literature that we place, each time we direct attention to the website, each return visit we make, each Bible study we conduct.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:19.580
We should have the final goal of making a baptized disciple.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.580
Why is baptism essential?

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.580
Put simply, it's because baptism is necessary for salvation.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.580
That's what the Bible tells us at 1 Peter, chapter 3, and verse 21.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:50.409
Baptism is also now saving you, not by the removing of the filth of the flesh, but by the request of God for a good conscience through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

00:02:51.409 --> 00:03:01.409
So, from the time we meet an interested person, we want to have our eyes on that goal of making a baptized disciple.

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:09.409
In fact, the November 1977 Kingdom Ministry made this statement regarding those we study with.

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:24.409
Our discussions should reflect a genuine personal interest in the student as a potential disciple, and therefore a potential brother or sister in the faith.

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:35.409
If we don't have that endpoint of a baptized disciple, fixed firmly in mind, we could end up stuck on side roads.

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:44.620
For example, watch this video and see if you can identify the problem that our brother has.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.620
Going out and fill service after lunch?

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.620
Yes, I'm going to be there, but I've got going to visit that guy to make.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:04:08.009
My neighbor lost his job after 20 years, and as a result, he's got to move out of his house, got to move into an apartment.

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:11.009
He decided to go help him out a little bit to pack up.

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:16.060
Make a little easier for him to make that move.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.060
You know, want to be nice a time period where we don't have to worry about economic troubles like that.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.060
Yeah, it will.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.060
You know, that's why I'm so happy that my grandchildren chose to go for higher education.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.060
They both landed good job on that bridge that you cross when you come here.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.060
You've noticed that they're starting to do some work on it, and that's pretty extensive work.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.060
They're going to replace that whole bridge.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.060
So, according to the newspaper article, it's going to be like a six to eight month project.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.060
It's a long time.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.060
Chris, the reason I came by is I wanted to show you this magazine.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.060
I love these. They're so well written.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.060
Isaiah 48, 17, is a key scripture here.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.060
Notice what it says.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:02.060
I, Jehovah, am your God, the one teaching you to benefit yourself.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.060
That's familiar. I think your dad read that to me once or twice.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.060
How's your dad doing anyway?

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.060
Doing good?

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.060
They said they've got more Bible saves than they can even cover in one week.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.060
Well, well.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:19.060
You know, I can remember when you and your dad came here, and you were a little kid about this high.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.060
And you just stayed right by our side, and your dad was so proud.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:29.060
You know, Chris, I know my dad had offered to stay the Bible with you in the past.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.060
John, be honest, I'm too old to change.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.060
I said in my ways now, I think that God's just going to have to take me the way I am.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.100
Or chocolate.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.100
Yeah.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:49.990
Could you identify with the brother in that video?

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.990
Have you ever had a return visit with someone who just loves your company?

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.990
Perhaps you've been leaving literature with that person for months, even years.

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.990
And yet the person has no genuine interest in progressing.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.990
Why is that a problem?

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:13.990
Apparently, the person isn't interested in becoming a disciple of Christ Jesus.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:22.990
Our time would be better spent searching for other people who are rightly disposed for everlasting life.

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:32.990
Of course, that doesn't mean that there's no value in placing literature or leaving contact cards that direct people to JW.org.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.990
These provisions are part of our teaching toolbox for a reason.

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:43.990
They can play a vital role in reaching the hearts of those who are rightly disposed.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:50.990
So, continue to make good use of these tools that Jehovah's Organization provides.

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:58.990
At the same time, never lose sight of your goal to start Bible studies with interested ones

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:05.990
and then the ultimate goal to make disciples baptizing them.

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.990
What about a person you've been studying with for years?

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:12.990
But the person isn't making changes.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:19.990
Hasn't stopped going to church and shows no real interest in attending Christian meetings.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:26.990
Some people are glad to study the Bible with us simply for the fact that they value Bible education.

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.990
And we love to teach people about the Bible.

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:39.990
But we have to remember that providing Bible education for its own sake is not our primary goal.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.990
In fact, it could be a side road.

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:54.990
The fact is, some people who value Bible education are not interested in becoming baptized disciples of Jesus.

00:07:54.990 --> 00:08:00.990
The world's full of Bible scholars who are highly educated in the Bible,

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:05.990
but who do not become disciples of Christ Jesus.

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:15.990
For example, one Bible scholar was educated at a Bible Institute, a religious college, and a theological seminary.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:19.990
He holds a doctorate in religious studies.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:27.990
He has a thorough knowledge of biblical Greek, and he's written 30 books about the Bible.

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:33.990
Yet he describes himself as an agnostic atheist.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:40.990
So, just providing Bible education is not our primary goal.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:48.990
We want people to build faith in God and to have their own relationship with Jehovah

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:56.990
that will move them toward the destination of dedication and baptism.

00:08:56.990 --> 00:09:03.990
That's why it's important to honestly analyze the progress of our Bible students.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:07.990
Are they simply taking in knowledge?

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:10.990
Do they prepare in advance for the study?

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:13.990
Do they answer in their own words?

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:21.990
From their heart, are they making changes in their life to conform to what they've learned?

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:26.990
Are they attending and benefiting from Christian meetings?

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:36.990
If not, we may need to follow the advice of the Kingdom Ministry of October 1988, which stated,

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:45.990
that a student is not making meaningful progress after you've patiently aided him over a reasonable period of time.

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:53.990
It may be best to use the time to better advantage searching for deserving ones.

00:09:53.990 --> 00:10:00.990
Depending on the circumstances, it may be wise to discontinue the study.

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:06.990
But why is it so important to be selective about who we spend our time with?

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:14.990
Isn't conducting an unproductive study better than knocking on doors where no one's home or where no one shows interest?

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:22.990
To answer that, let's read Jesus' words at Matthew chapter 10 verses 11 to 13.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:29.990
Now, when instructing his disciples about how to conduct their ministry, Jesus said,

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:38.990
into whatever city or village you enter, search out who in it is deserving and stay there until you leave.

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:42.990
When you enter the house, greet the household.

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:48.990
If the house is deserving, let the peace you wish it come upon it.

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:55.990
But if it is not deserving, let the peace from you return upon you.

00:10:55.990 --> 00:11:02.990
In harmony with those verses, we want to focus our attention on deserving ones.

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:09.990
As Jesus instructed, people who are rightly disposed for everlasting life.

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:12.990
Obviously, there is a balance.

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:21.990
We need to be patient with those we call on and study with, and not everyone progresses at the same rate.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:34.990
But as we call on people and study with them, we should never lose sight of our goal, our destination, to make disciples baptizing them.

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:45.990
If we have that goal clearly in mind, we'll know when we are moving toward it, and we'll know when we are getting sidetracked.

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:48.990
We could illustrate it like this.

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:51.990
Think of a plane on a runway.

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:59.990
That plane is like a person you visited, and you believe shows sincere interest in the Bible's message.

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:06.990
Your short-term goal at this point is to get them off the runway and into a Bible study.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:11.990
If you do, that means the plane is taken off.

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:18.990
But once your study is airborne, you have to keep your sights on your destination.

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:21.990
You can't just stay in the air indefinitely.

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:26.990
Your goal is to make a baptized disciple.

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:33.990
If in a reasonable amount of time the student isn't progressing, what will you do?

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:38.990
To keep the study going would be like flying in circles.

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:45.990
In the same way, a Bible study that simply suspended in the air goes nowhere.

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:55.990
We have to land the plane either at the destination of a baptized disciple or at the termination of the study.

00:12:55.990 --> 00:13:02.990
But what if something's holding your Bible student back from the destination of baptism?

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:09.990
Maybe an attachment to holiday celebrations or an unclean habit like smoking?

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:14.990
Notice how this issue arises in the following brief video.

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:20.990
When I started studying the Bible, there were various factors that hindered my study.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:24.990
I was a truck driver and I was on the road a lot.

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:27.990
I had the worst kind of friendships and I smoked.

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:31.990
I smoked an average 60 cigarettes a day.

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:36.990
I realized that if I was going to make the needed adjustments, I had to change my profession.

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:42.990
So I changed my job, but if I wanted to get baptized, I had to stop smoking.

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:46.990
I cut down to two or three cigarettes a day.

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:50.990
One day I bought a single cigarette.

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:54.990
I lit it and I prated your hover.

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:59.750
I begged him to help me and he did help me.

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:02.750
So much so that I never smoked again.

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:06.750
And to this day, I don't even have the urge to smoke.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:10.750
Ten years after my first Bible study, I was baptized.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:17.750
I've been serving Jehovah for 20 years now, along with my wife and all my children.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:25.750
Did you notice this man had to pray to Jehovah to get the help he needed to overcome smoking?

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:36.750
In other words, he had to cultivate his own relationship with Jehovah in order to build the faith he needed to stop smoking.

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:52.750
In the same way, we need to help our students to build their own relationship with Jehovah so that they'll also overcome any obstacles that might hold them back from progressing to baptism.

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:57.750
But what if you're not presently conducting a Bible study?

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:03.750
What if you've never had the privilege of having one of your Bible students get baptized?

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:07.750
Does that mean your service to Jehovah is not valuable?

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:09.750
Not at all.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:13.750
Remember, we each do our part in the ministry.

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:20.750
Do you remember what the Apostle Paul said at 1 Corinthians 3, 6 and 7?

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:37.750
I planted a Paulus watered, but God kept making it grow so that neither is the one who plants anything nor is the one who waters, but God who makes it grow.

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:42.750
So never feel that your efforts are unimportant.

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:48.750
Just as Paul said, what's accomplished in the ministry is a group effort.

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:59.750
When a person reaches baptism, it isn't just because of the effort of the person who conducted the study, the efforts of others played a role.

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:08.750
Perhaps someone else initiated that person's interest by placing literature or in some other way giving a witness.

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:11.750
But remember what Paul said.

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:15.750
Jehovah is the one who makes it grow.

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:24.750
He's the one that's drawing to himself those who are rightly disposed for everlasting life.

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:34.750
What a privilege we have to be fellow workers with Jehovah as we help people become disciples of Christ Jesus.

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:41.750
If we keep that goal clearly in mind, how will it help us?

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:48.750
We won't be content just to place literature or just to direct interest to JW.org.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:54.750
We won't be satisfied just making return visits or starting Bible studies.

00:16:54.750 --> 00:17:05.750
We'll always have in mind our primary destination, making disciples of Christ and baptizing them.

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:20.750
We of the governing body wish you Jehovah's rich blessing as you work shoulder to shoulder with us in helping rightly disposed ones become baptized disciples of Jesus.
