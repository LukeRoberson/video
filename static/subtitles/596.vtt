00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:10.779
rejoice with those who rejoice. Weep with those who weep. You know, when you think of the ancient

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:18.660
nation of Israel, the Jewish people and how they responded to happy situations or to sad

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:27.940
occasions, as a general rule, they had few, if any, inhibitions. They did not hold back their

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:35.460
emotions, their feelings. They would rip their garments out of sorrow or stress, or they would

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:43.659
dance and cry out joyfully because they were so happy. Think of King David when the

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:51.460
Ark of the Covenant was brought to Jerusalem. Here was a grown man who was the King of Israel.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:01:01.939
Second Samuel, chapter 6, verse 14 says, David was dancing around before Jehovah with all his

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:11.379
might. Picture David in your mind's eye dancing around before the Ark of the Covenant. But isn't it

00:01:11.379 --> 00:01:18.739
wonderful, really, that David was so free of inhibitions that he did not even think or care for an

00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:29.219
instant what someone might think of him for what he was doing? David was fully absorbed in the joy

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:40.659
of Jehovah and it's truly beautiful. Now, think of David's wife, Michael. How did she feel about

00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:50.819
David dancing around in the street, leaping with joy? Did she rejoice with David? No. She was not

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:57.219
thinking either about Jehovah, his worship, or about the happiness that David had because of the

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:04.900
Ark of the Covenant coming to Jerusalem. Rather, she was focused only on herself and perhaps,

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:16.659
on her dignity as daughter of a king and wife of a king. But the joy of Jehovah was sadly missing.

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:26.900
She could not bring herself to rejoice with David who was rejoicing. It's really sad when you

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:37.060
think about it. She was a prisoner of exaggerated self-importance and pride. Many people today

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:44.659
show their emotions and many do not. Some of us may have been taught by parents or others that we

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:52.340
should refrain and restrain ourselves and not show emotion. And in some cultures, this is basically

00:02:52.340 --> 00:03:00.500
the rule. Don't show any emotion. And we must admit that, yes, self-control is a good thing.

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:10.659
However, we do not want to be controlled by inhibitions, feelings that make us self-conscious

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:18.500
and unable to act in a relaxed and natural way. That type of control is really not necessary.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:26.340
The Council from Paul tells us to be unafraid to show emotion and especially when comforting others

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:33.379
or when we rejoice with others. For example, I remember a convention back in 1968 in Washington,

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:40.740
D.C. My wife and I were serving as special pioneers at that time in D.C. And at the convention,

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:47.620
it was at RFK Stadium, the drama about Jehovah's Daughter was being presented. And sitting behind us,

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:53.939
that day was a district overseer in his wife. Well, it got to a very emotional part in the drama.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:01.379
And I turned and looked back at the district overseer and I could see big tears coming down his cheeks.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:10.740
Isn't that interesting? He was unafraid to show his emotions, his feelings, he was captivated by

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:18.180
the drama. He wasn't embarrassed because tears were flowing from his face. That is quite a

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:24.500
wonderful thing not to have such inhibitions that were so afraid someone might see us with a tear

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:32.740
running down our cheek. Haven't you become teary-eyed? On occasion, when watching a video, perhaps about

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:42.089
our courageous brothers, we've all had that take place. On such occasions, we should not be afraid

00:04:42.089 --> 00:04:48.889
to show our feelings, especially when we go to comfort someone and be of help to them. Emotions

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:57.050
can transmit the feeling to others. They can see in your face, they can feel in your voice,

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.970
the emotions that you have. And many times, that can be more powerful than even the words you

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:10.980
speak to comfort a person. Something else that's good to keep in mind is that not everyone experiences

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:17.620
an express's grief in the same way. Some want to talk about it. And that's good, that's fine.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:24.819
Others don't want to talk about their problems and difficulties. We respect their privacy.

00:05:26.019 --> 00:05:36.100
Proverbs 1410 says this, the heart knows its own bitterness and no outsider can share in its joy.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:42.579
And that's true. We can't really express fully what we may be feeling in our heart when we're

00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:48.420
under a great deal of stress or faced with a terrible problem. The words really aren't there,

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:54.100
we don't know how to say them. Or if we're really joyful, it may be a little bit easier to speak

00:05:54.100 --> 00:06:00.660
about how we feel. But this is a comment the Watchtower made about Proverbs 1410. It said,

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:09.459
can we always express our innermost emotions, whether sadness or joy to others and share with

00:06:09.459 --> 00:06:17.699
them precisely what we are experiencing? And then it adds this question, and can one at all times

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:27.379
fully understand how another person feels? The answer to both questions is no. However,

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:33.620
regardless of what humans can or cannot understand about our feelings,

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:42.420
Jehovah does. And there are times when he's the only one, really, we can go to and open our heart

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:49.459
and realize that he can read our heart and he can see exactly how we feel and what we're going through.

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:56.660
It's good to remember that when we go to comfort some, when usually what is need is needed,

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:07.139
is empathy more than answers, comfort more than solutions. One sister who felt comforted by

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:14.259
fellow believers after the loss of her daughter said this, I appreciated it when friends came over

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:23.699
and just cried with me. She derived comfort from their company. A sister named Rachel,

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:29.779
whose mother became seriously depressed, had some interesting words to say because when a person

00:07:29.779 --> 00:07:36.660
is emotionally distraught and depressed, they may say things at times that are rude and unkind,

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:42.899
even outrageous. And we don't want to always take them seriously as to what they say.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.100
This is what the sister said about her mother.

00:07:47.379 --> 00:07:54.420
Many times, mom would say something very hateful. Most of these times, I tried to remind myself

00:07:54.420 --> 00:08:02.420
of the kind of person mom really is, loving, kind and generous. I learned that depressed people

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:10.980
say many things they do not mean. The worst thing that one can do is to return evil words

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:18.259
or actions. Yes, so we need to call ourselves down if we find ourselves in a situation like that.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:25.220
Job described really what Rachel was talking about with some depressed people. Take your Bible and

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:34.659
look up Job chapter 6 verses 2 through 4. This is what Job said. Job 6 through 4. If only my

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:43.139
anguish could be fully weighed and put on scales together with my calamity. For now it is heavier

00:08:43.139 --> 00:08:52.580
than the sands of the seas. And notice what he says next. That is why my words have been wild

00:08:52.580 --> 00:09:00.659
talk. Yes, Job was guilty of wild talk and he admitted it. The next verse, notice what he says,

00:09:00.659 --> 00:09:06.419
for the arrows of the Almighty have pierced me and my spirit is drinking their venom.

00:09:07.059 --> 00:09:15.779
The terrorists from God are lined up against me. Well, he, he engaged in wild talk because of all

00:09:15.779 --> 00:09:23.059
the pressure that that poor man was under at the time. So people say things, people who are depressed

00:09:23.059 --> 00:09:29.700
say things that may shock us. We just need to absorb what they say and not try to correct at that

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:37.700
moment every wild expression. When calmness sets in, we may be able to help the person regain his

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:43.940
or her composure. Just as Eli who did with Job, he waited for a number of days before he spoke

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:51.539
and then when he spoke, his words were soothing and they helped to calm Job. So we may be able to do

00:09:51.539 --> 00:10:01.539
the same if we apply the good counsel found in Jobhova's word.
