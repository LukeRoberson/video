It looks like Caleb is getting hungry.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:42.789
Let's see how Caleb asks his mom for food.

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:43.789
Caleb!

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:49.740
Hmm, do you think that was the best way to ask for food?

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:59.200
Let's give Caleb a second chance and listen to what special word he uses this time.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.200
Mom, can you please make me something to eat?

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.200
Oh yes, sweetie! I'm gonna make you the best sandwich ever!

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.200
That's much better. That word please makes all the difference.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.200
Even Jehovah uses the word please.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.200
Now that you got what you asked for Caleb, what do you say?

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.200
Thank you, mommy.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.200
Very good. Always remember to say please and thank you.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.200
And don't forget to thank Jehovah.
