00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.949
video games. They can be a lot of fun and can seem like a great way to pass time.

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:21.949
But, like most forms of fun, playing video games can take over your life in ways you don't want.

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:29.949
For example, at Ephesians 5, 15, and 16, the Bible says to make the best use of your time.

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:36.950
So if you're up when you should be sleeping, then who's in control? You or the game?

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.950
That doesn't make you a winner.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.950
Think about it. If you lose money, you may be able to get it back.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.950
But that's not true when you lose time.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.950
In a sense then, time is more valuable than money.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.950
So don't let yourself be robbed.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.950
Do you find yourself skipping meals?

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.950
Not doing homework?

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.950
And generally not taking care of yourself in order to get through endless levels in your game?

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.950
How can you stop losing out on those important parts of life?

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.950
Is your gaming console in your bedroom?

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.950
Move it out so you can get some sleep.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.329
At times, it might be good to take a break.

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:23.329
Why not stop playing for a week?

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:26.329
Replace gaming was something active.

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:32.329
You know, actual exercise. Come to think of it, you might want to do some of that every day.

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.329
At Ecclesiastes 3-4, the Bible says that there's a time to laugh.

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.329
And a time to dance.

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:45.329
So it's okay to spend some time playing video games.

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.700
Just not all the time.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.700
There's something else video games can rob you of.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.700
Your sense of right and wrong.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.700
The Bible says that God hates anyone loving violence.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.700
The fact is, video games promote lots of things the Bible condemns.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.699
Violence, immoral sex, and spiritism.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:10.699
Is it just a game?

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:12.699
Imagine you were doing that in real life.

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:16.699
You know all that stuff in the game you're playing.

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:19.699
What kind of person would you be?

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:22.699
Your choice in video games may say a lot about who you are,

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:27.699
and what you think is right and wrong.

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:31.699
What about online games that connect you with other players?

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:33.699
Do you know who's on the other end?

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:38.530
Your game could be putting you with the wrong people.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:48.449
It's definitely worth taking a look at your gaming habits.

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:53.449
The bottom line, playing video games can be good recreation.

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:59.449
But don't let games rob you of your time or your sense of right and wrong.

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:02.449
Instead of trying hard to be a winner in a game,

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:06.449
use your time and energy to be a winner in real life.
