WEBVTT

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:14.529
We've been planning this looking forward to this for more than a year.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.250
We've been making preparations for about eight months to attend.

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.850
This is the first time this kind of thing has happened here in Zimbabwe.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.769
Everybody is talking about it. They're all very excited.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.329
And then we're going to have delegates from all the parts of the world.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.009
There's so many brothers and sisters waiting for us for a long, long time, okay?

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.210
That's my heart.

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:47.490
Once you physically see them and feel that hug, it's just overwhelming.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.409
Seeing the smile, seeing the welcoming of the brothers,

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:55.250
at the gates and here at the stadium, it's really beyond comparison.

00:00:56.369 --> 00:01:01.810
Here we have thousands of people from more than 50 countries coming together under the same faith,

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.329
under the same loyalty to their creator. This is very moving.

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:15.629
Good morning, brothers and sisters.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.549
At all and every one of the presents.

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:26.189
What a joy it is to be gathered together for this international convention.

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.750
We're so happy to be here, isn't that true?

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:36.349
What would your life be like without the influence of God's Kingdom?

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:41.709
Don't you agree with me that we are seeing benefits now from God's Kingdom?

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:44.829
We know where we've come from. We know why we're here.

00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:46.989
We know what the future holds.

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:50.189
God's Kingdom will rule the earth.

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.310
The question is, will it rule us?

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.469
God loves you. God cares for you.

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:16.750
And the spirit of God is stronger than any imperfection that you have.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.349
That one, the great, shuts up the Kingdom of God.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:26.750
However, with the powerful help of the angels, we can save ones out of that evil world empire.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.789
People don't know, people rely on their pastors, rely on their priests,

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:35.069
rely on their hierarchy, and instead, they're lying to them.

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.110
We have fled from Babylon the Great.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.229
We have been given the key of knowledge, accurate Bible knowledge,

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:45.710
and we are not afraid to use it.

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:51.780
And when you do face challenges,

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.139
grow through them.

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:54.900
Grow closer to Jehovah.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.819
As you draw closer to Jehovah, you draw closer to each other.

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:04.580
Let your children see your absolute confidence in Jehovah.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.819
Help them to be able to build their own relationship with our loving God, Jehovah.

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.560
Jesus, your family can be happy.

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:29.250
It's a very very special privilege for me.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:51.199
It's a very spiritually enriching experience to all of us.

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:56.939
We really see the governing body is going for us, and it's amazing.

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:08.909
Go. Your faith has made you well.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:23.759
Now let us shrink-wrap this talk into two words, take action.

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:28.319
So the question is, what are you willing to sacrifice in order to have God's favor?

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.600
Even if we have to limp across the finish line,

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.920
you too can enter into eternal Kingdom Blessings.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:52.319
Day is a very very special day for me because today I'm getting baptized.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:22.110
And excited because I know that I am now one of Jehovah's ones.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.019
You, together with all the other brothers around the world,

00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:37.220
are living, visible proof of the reality of the established Kingdom.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.899
New book entitled, God Kingdom Rules.

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:02.220
In the world, they say, you're only young once.

00:06:03.019 --> 00:06:06.779
But in the truth, we say, you're only old once.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:12.379
You're going to be young forever, so you might as well relax and enjoy your old age.

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:13.579
It's temporary.

00:06:13.579 --> 00:06:46.589
Load yourselves down to your brothers and sisters with the things the nations are eagerly pursuing.

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:50.829
Instead, keep seeking first God's Kingdom.

00:06:55.949 --> 00:07:00.350
Jehovah's organization is amazing and it's all one by love and you just don't really want to go

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:01.870
high on the end of the day. So nice.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:07.230
The program has strengthened me so much that, in my mind, we're almost at the finish line and

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.550
we cannot give up at the finish line.

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:14.990
It spurs us on, the program and the talks to make even more sacrifices to keep seeking first the

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:20.350
Kingdom. It came from different parts of the world. We speak different languages,

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.629
but we feel as a one big spiritual family.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:25.629
Thanks to Jehovah and his teachings.

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:32.350
I don't have a family. This is my big family. I don't have a parent, sisters,

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:33.949
but this is my family now.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:42.079
When I get home, I'm determined to go and to be with the friends and love them and

00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:45.680
always show them my best to show as much hospitality as I can.

00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:49.759
Sometimes we can feel a little bit out on the edge, a bit forgotten,

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:55.519
but coming to an international event slightly just reminds us of how much we're part of a brother,

00:07:55.519 --> 00:08:01.439
but we're united. Somehow it's raining here and everyone's happy. I mean, how is that possible?

00:08:02.959 --> 00:08:07.920
I really felt like the information that's been given from the slate has been directed to me

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:15.839
partially. Coming in Jehovah's house, coming where the friends are, words cannot express my joy.

00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:21.199
This is truly Jehovah's family. The brothers with full of love, it's like I've met them before,

00:08:21.199 --> 00:08:26.800
it's like I've always known them. It does make us feel like we are one united brother,

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:33.679
but that's been my whole experience. It really helps us to appreciate that we have such a big

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:38.159
brotherhood. It really made me proud to be a servant of Jehovah.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.600
I can't stop thinking what the situation will be like in the new world when this will all be a

00:08:45.600 --> 00:09:00.000
reality and an everyday thing. I'm not sure that there exists the words to describe my feelings,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:12.049
it's just I'm speechless. This is just the taste of good things to come.
