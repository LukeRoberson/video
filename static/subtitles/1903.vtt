WEBVTT

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:06.480
Brothers and sisters, welcome to our update.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.619
Since our last report, there have been some exciting developments.

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:18.339
On May 31st, 2022, the governing body informed all branch committees that we would now

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:24.940
resume all forms of our public ministry except house to housework.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:31.219
Around the world, our brothers and sisters were thrilled to resume public witnessing.

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:35.460
The resuming in-person preaching once is to sit.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.020
It was like we were resurrected.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.420
We were gone and then we were back.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.380
It was unifying.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.659
And the brothers said, it was like riding a bicycle.

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:54.100
It all came back quickly and we had a great time.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.939
A member of the branch committee in the United States was working with a small group

00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:05.260
making return visits that they hadn't made in person since before the pandemic.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.459
He said, I was worried that people would stand off-ish or that they'd be worried about

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:17.140
the virus, but that just wasn't the case at all.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.859
After having a good discussion with his return visit, the brothers said it was so refreshing

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:29.590
to actually witness to someone in person at the door.

00:01:29.629 --> 00:01:34.549
Recently, I had a similar experience when sharing in street work.

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:40.750
A young woman noticed that the brother with me had watched our magazines and she stopped

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.150
us.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.469
She said that she was so happy to see Jehovah's Witnesses that led to a good discussion

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:53.829
and arrangements were made for a sister to contact her.

00:01:53.829 --> 00:02:00.019
It was such a pleasure to be in street work again.

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:06.379
In Zambia, a public bus driver stopped the bus when he saw our brothers street witnessing

00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:09.539
and he received a magazine from the brothers.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.419
He asked them to preach to his passengers.

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:20.939
All of the passengers on the bus gladly listened and took magazines.

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:29.500
The weekend of June 25, 2022, was a milestone for our translation efforts.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:36.939
13 language editions of the New World Translation were released in one weekend.

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:41.300
Some of the releases were of individual Bible books.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.819
Others were the complete edition of the Greek Scriptures.

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.460
And some were of the complete Bible.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:55.939
Previously, the largest number of Bibles released in the single weekend was six.

00:02:55.939 --> 00:03:01.830
We thanked Jehovah for these precious gifts.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:09.830
On June 7, 2022, the European Court of Human Rights ruled in favor of Jehovah's Witnesses

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.909
in 21 cases all in one day.

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:24.710
Our previous record for court victories awarded in one day was on May 3, 1943, when we

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.189
won 12 cases in the United States Supreme Court.

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:35.270
We praised Jehovah for these fine victories.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:44.069
Twenty of the 21 cases this month form a historic judgment against Russia for persecuting

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.590
Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.030
What did the court decide?

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.069
In the following video, brothers working with the World Headquarters Legal Department

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.949
answered these questions.

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:01.990
Brothers, this decision is truly historic.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:08.229
In fact, the court consolidated 20 of our cases into one decision and ruled conclusively

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:11.789
in our favor in all of them.

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:19.629
Throughout the 196-page decision, the court meticulously dismantles the lies that Russia

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:25.310
has used to persecute our brothers and ban our worship.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.750
Shane, in what way specifically did the court condemn Russia?

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:37.589
Well, the decision unambiguously declares that Russia is guilty of carrying out a premeditated

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:43.389
and relentless attack on innocent worshipers and on pure worship.

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:48.750
For example, at paragraph 254 of the decision, the European Court states that the Russian

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:56.230
authorities had pursued a policy of intolerance designed to cause Jehovah's Witnesses to abandon

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.750
their faith and to prevent others from joining it.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.430
Of course, that policy was entirely unsuccessful.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.709
In fact, this judgment completely exonerates Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:14.029
For example, Russia claimed that our publications and websites are extremist simply because

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:16.750
we believe that we have the truth.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:23.350
In response, the European Court ruled that any religious entity or individual believers

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:29.269
have the right to proclaim and defend their doctrine as the true and superior one.

00:05:29.269 --> 00:05:32.990
Shane, what else did the court say in our favor?

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.829
The European Court confirms our right to engage in our door-to-door preaching for parents

00:05:38.829 --> 00:05:45.569
to teach their children to worship Jehovah, own and use our places of worship to refuse

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:52.129
military service, to refuse blood transfusions and choose effective alternatives, and to be

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:54.329
politically neutral.

00:05:54.329 --> 00:05:59.170
In all of these areas, the European Court concludes that our religious beliefs and activities

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:05.529
are entirely peaceful and are protected by the right to freedom of religion.

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:11.610
Among other things, the decision orders Russia to stop persecuting Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:17.449
restore our legal status, release those who are in prison, allow us to use our literature

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:23.889
and website, and either return the properties that were confiscated or pay us the equivalent

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:27.089
of over $65 million dollars.

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:28.850
Outstanding.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:34.889
We are just so grateful to the many brothers and sisters who work tirelessly to bring

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:39.290
these cases before the European Court of Human Rights.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:43.490
One will tell whether Russia will comply with this decision.

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:50.610
But even if it does not, this decision is legally binding on the 46 countries who have submitted

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.689
to the jurisdiction of the European Court.

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:59.889
Thus, the rights of over one and a half million Jehovah's Witnesses who live in these lands

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:03.129
are better protected than ever.

00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:08.970
But even more, because the European Court is held in such high regard, this decision

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:14.050
will have great weight before high courts worldwide.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:23.199
We thank Jehovah for this historic victory, this resounding victory from the European Court.

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:28.839
We are confident that regardless of what the secular authorities do, Jehovah is going

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:32.600
to continue to be with our brothers.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.639
Why do we know that?

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:39.079
Because of what is stated that I say a 54-17.

00:07:39.079 --> 00:07:40.800
Do we read?

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:47.439
No weapon formed against you will have any success, and you will condemn any tongue that

00:07:47.439 --> 00:07:50.720
rises up against you in the judgment.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:56.639
This is the heritage of the servants of Jehovah, and their righteousness is from me, declares

00:07:56.639 --> 00:07:57.639
Jehovah.

00:07:57.639 --> 00:08:06.639
Yes, our heritage from Jehovah assures us of his constant support now and forever.

00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:12.480
With that assurance, no opposition will weaken our faith or deprivation of the peace and

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:18.040
spiritual prosperity we enjoy as God's servants.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:23.519
This is clearly seen when we consider how Jehovah helped our brothers during the persecution

00:08:23.519 --> 00:08:27.240
in the former Soviet Union.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:32.679
In the rest of this update, we are going to consider some examples of how Jehovah looked

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:36.159
after his people during that time.

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:41.399
You know, this will be so encouraging, not only for our brothers in Russia, but also

00:08:41.399 --> 00:08:48.720
for all of us since we are all facing opposition in one way or another.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:54.600
As we watch the following interviews, ask yourself, if this happened to me, what would

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.720
I do?

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:03.320
What helped these brothers and sisters to remain loyal to Jehovah?

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:06.399
I was baptized at the age of 15.

00:09:06.399 --> 00:09:11.960
Few weeks later, school administration discovered that I am one of Jehovah's witnesses and decided

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:17.440
to readjust me and our family so that we renounce our faith.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.320
They did not stop pressuring us for three years.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:26.879
At the age of 18, I received a conscription to the Soviet army, but I refused and was sentenced

00:09:26.879 --> 00:09:30.039
to two years of imprisonment.

00:09:30.039 --> 00:09:34.519
When I was serving the sentence, I married a lovely and faithful sister, Lydia.

00:09:34.519 --> 00:09:37.720
Soon after, I received a second call to join the army.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:42.679
This time, the court rendered a sentence of three years in a unit of strict regime.

00:09:42.679 --> 00:09:44.759
I was born in Ukraine.

00:09:44.759 --> 00:09:49.320
When I got married, I moved to live with my husband in Lithuania.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:53.720
Seven months later, my husband received a prison sentence.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:58.600
Emotionally, this was so difficult that I ended up in the hospital.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.759
Soon, we lost our unborn baby.

00:10:01.759 --> 00:10:07.480
And here I was, alone in a foreign land, unable to speak the local language.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:13.000
In view of the imprisonment of my husband, I was not able to find a job.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.600
Prison guards were cruel and would often beat the prisoners.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.639
I suffered such mistreatment as well.

00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:26.039
More than that, I was isolated from my family and from my spiritual brothers and sisters.

00:10:26.039 --> 00:10:30.559
We heard this part was the separation from my dear wife, Lydia.

00:10:30.559 --> 00:10:36.240
Even so, Lydia was a special source of support for me.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.080
Almost every day she wrote me letters.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:44.919
I received more letters than all other 30 inmates combined.

00:10:44.919 --> 00:10:50.279
To support my husband spiritually, in my letters, I would include verses from the scriptures

00:10:50.279 --> 00:10:55.200
and quotations from publications trying to put them in a way that the censorship would

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.200
not be able to spot them.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.559
Christian meetings were a source of strength for me.

00:11:00.559 --> 00:11:02.360
I never missed them.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:08.960
On one occasion, when we held a meeting in our homes, a group of militia and KGB broken.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.799
As a result, I received a call to appear before the court.

00:11:12.799 --> 00:11:16.200
On the day of a court hearing, I was very worried.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:21.679
But Jehovah gave me such calmness that fear and nervousness disappeared.

00:11:21.679 --> 00:11:25.559
I was sentenced to pay a fine of 50 rubles.

00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:28.519
At the time, it was a large sum of money.

00:11:28.519 --> 00:11:33.759
But I was not intimidated and never stopped attending meetings.

00:11:33.759 --> 00:11:38.360
I used opportunities to give a witness to others in the prison.

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:46.000
There were instances when an audience of dozens of prisoners would listen to me.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.759
When they asked questions that were more difficult to answer, I would analyze them and ponder

00:11:52.759 --> 00:11:59.000
over them, so as to be able to explain the grounds for my beliefs.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.879
Prayer was a constant companion.

00:12:01.879 --> 00:12:05.960
I saw how Jehovah responded to them.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:10.159
Sometimes, he would answer in a way I did not expect.

00:12:10.159 --> 00:12:15.559
I always stayed focused on the reason why Jehovah wants me to remain faithful to him through

00:12:15.559 --> 00:12:18.720
all those difficulties and this helped a lot.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:24.120
There were many occasions when the help I received could not have come from any other source

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.440
but Jehovah.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.679
Therefore, he became my best friend.

00:12:28.679 --> 00:12:31.600
He would always come to the rescue.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:37.279
The weaker I was, the more help came from Jehovah.

00:12:37.279 --> 00:12:41.879
Let us not think about how we are going to enter tests.

00:12:41.879 --> 00:12:45.159
Think about how Jehovah will help us.

00:12:45.159 --> 00:12:49.679
He will give us strength to endure everything.

00:12:49.679 --> 00:12:54.039
And during the things Jehovah allows us to experience is not in vain.

00:12:54.039 --> 00:12:55.960
It is beneficial for us.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:00.600
It fortifies and tempers our faith, so to speak.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:06.519
What we need is the right positive attitude toward difficulties we face and we have to

00:13:06.519 --> 00:13:12.480
be determined to stay faithful to Jehovah to the end.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:18.240
We appreciate your faithful endurance, Brother and Sister Pachuvis.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:25.159
You reminded us how vital it is to regularly attend meetings and share in the ministry,

00:13:25.159 --> 00:13:29.840
both before and during times of persecution.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:36.039
This helps to stabilize us and keep our faith strong.

00:13:36.039 --> 00:13:42.039
In our next interview, notice how parental training regularly taking in spiritual food

00:13:42.039 --> 00:13:52.259
and remaining determined never to compromise help Joseph and Vera Rusu to endure persecution.

00:13:52.259 --> 00:13:57.899
I dealt with persecution when I was six years old.

00:13:57.899 --> 00:14:06.460
My father and older brother were sentenced to 25 years in prison as conscientious objectors.

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:10.139
I wondered if I would ever see them again.

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:16.259
However, thankfully, they were released two years later.

00:14:16.259 --> 00:14:22.700
Their example has strengthened me to remain faithful to Jehovah.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:26.299
I also faced persecution when I was a child.

00:14:26.299 --> 00:14:29.740
At school, I was often beaten because I preached.

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:35.419
I didn't wear the Soviet star and tie, and I didn't sing patriotic songs.

00:14:35.419 --> 00:14:43.019
From an early age, my parents taught me to love Jehovah, to read from the Bible,

00:14:43.019 --> 00:14:48.700
to sing praises to him, and to learn verses by heart.

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:54.220
They took us with them to the meetings that were held three times a week.

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:56.860
I loved to participate.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:00.779
I always had my hand up.

00:15:00.779 --> 00:15:08.059
My parents taught me how to respond to those who would put pressure on us to betray my brothers or my parents.

00:15:08.059 --> 00:15:14.779
The love and trust in Jehovah that my parents planted in my heart helped me to cherish him

00:15:14.779 --> 00:15:18.059
and to want to remain loyal to him.

00:15:18.059 --> 00:15:24.620
When I was 15, our family was deported to Siberia by train.

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:35.500
In these difficult conditions, I found comfort and joy in the spiritual food that we managed to take from home.

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.940
Those were the most important things.

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:44.620
All the way there on the train, we sang songs.

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:52.620
Ten years later, when I was in Kazakhstan, I was arrested and sentenced to five years.

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:59.019
Oftentimes, the prison guards pressured me to compromise and renounce my faith.

00:15:59.019 --> 00:16:06.379
But meditating on the issue of Jehovah's sovereignty helped me to stay firm.

00:16:06.379 --> 00:16:12.379
I prayed to Jehovah for the strength to endure and to remain faithful.

00:16:12.379 --> 00:16:20.779
Reading the Bible helped me to endure trials and not to make any compromises, no matter what.

00:16:20.779 --> 00:16:27.019
After I finished my prison sentence, I returned to Moldova.

00:16:27.019 --> 00:16:33.659
Then, in 1967, Vera and I got married.

00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:41.179
Two years later, Josef was tried by the Supreme Court of Moldova in sentence to

00:16:41.179 --> 00:16:44.940
ten years in a maximum security camp.

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:50.379
Suddenly, I was left alone at 18, with a one-year-old boy.

00:16:50.379 --> 00:16:57.899
I was often called by the KGB and interrogated for hours, sometimes for five hours.

00:16:57.899 --> 00:17:03.340
They told me many lies and attempted to sow doubts in my mind.

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:08.619
The next few years, I saw my son grow up only in photographs,

00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:12.059
and when Vera would visit me twice a year.

00:17:12.059 --> 00:17:17.740
One of the things I especially looked forward to receiving from her was a new pair of boots.

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:24.140
The other brothers and sisters in I wrote the magazines on very thin sheets of paper

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.940
that had the shape of a soul.

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:35.339
We removed the souls of the boots, filled them with magazines, and then nailed the souls back on.

00:17:35.339 --> 00:17:39.740
It was possible to fit seven magazines and one pair of boots.

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:46.460
During persecution, your relationship with Jehovah becomes closer, more real,

00:17:46.539 --> 00:17:52.700
Jehovah is kind. He is giving me the power beyond what is normal.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:18:00.299
In my life, the greater the trials, the more opportunities Jehovah gave me to talk about his

00:18:00.299 --> 00:18:06.460
purpose and his kingdom. The way Jehovah helps me focus on what I have, and not on the hardships

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:14.299
that I have endured, brings me so much joy and comfort. I have no reason not to be happy.

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:22.059
Thank you, brother and sister Rusu, for sharing your experience with us.

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:27.980
Did you notice what helped them prepare for and face persecution?

00:18:29.339 --> 00:18:35.420
In addition to good parental training, they regularly took in spiritual food and learned

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:43.420
Bible verses by heart, and they kept clearly in mind the issue of Jehovah's sovereignty,

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:48.859
remaining determined, never to compromise. We can do the same today.

00:18:50.779 --> 00:18:55.819
Both of these couples remind us of the words recorded at Hebrews 13-6.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:02.059
Jehovah is my helper. I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?

00:19:03.019 --> 00:19:08.220
Jehovah truly was the help of our brothers and sisters in the former Soviet Union.

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:15.420
Despite all the waves of persecution that our brothers faced, they remained faithful

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:24.619
and their numbers grew. For example, in 1949 there were about 10,000 witnesses in the countries

00:19:24.619 --> 00:19:29.660
that formed the Soviet Union, and most of those were in Western Ukraine.

00:19:30.619 --> 00:19:37.099
Now, the number of publishers in those countries is over 380,000.

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:46.299
Truly, Jehovah helped them. In the late 1970s and 80s, I worked very closely with the

00:19:46.299 --> 00:19:53.019
brothers behind the iron curtain. I saw not only their faith, but also the many ways that Jehovah

00:19:53.099 --> 00:19:58.619
helped them. Jehovah always made sure they had the spiritual food they needed.

00:20:00.059 --> 00:20:04.220
The brothers really appreciated the importance of attending meetings,

00:20:04.779 --> 00:20:11.900
even though these were held in small groups, and they loved to sing theocratic songs,

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:18.539
learning many of these by heart. They had to risk their freedom and even their safety in order

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:26.859
to attend in-person meetings. But they always made the effort. Even though the devil tried to break

00:20:26.859 --> 00:20:33.180
their integrity, I saw again and again how Jehovah prospered our brothers and helped them to

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:41.799
remain faithful. The Russian government can liquidate a legal entity, but they can never liquidate

00:20:41.799 --> 00:20:50.680
Jehovah's organization. What will happen to the king of the north? Daniel 1145 tells us,

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:59.640
he will come all the way to his end, and there will be no helper for him. There will be no helper

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:11.000
for the king of the north, but who will be our helper? What did Hebrews 136 say? Jehovah is my helper.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:19.319
Brothers and sisters, be determined. Come what may to put your full confidence in Jehovah and be

00:21:19.319 --> 00:21:28.680
faithful. Jehovah will be your helper. We ideally love each one of you. From the world headquarters

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:38.680
of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.
