WEBVTT

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.519
We are happy to continue with the annual meeting program.

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:13.279
We now have with us, Brother Len Myers, a helper to the writing committee, who will conduct

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:18.800
an interview with wives of branch committee members in the United States.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.839
Brother Myers, please.

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:27.640
The accounts of faithful women are found throughout the Bible.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.119
One faithful Christian sister is mentioned by the Apostle Paul at Romans chapter 16, verses

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.960
1 and 2.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:41.079
Mary mentions Phoebe, who proved herself to be a defender of many, including Paul.

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.560
Today we're blessed to be able to get to know faithful Christian sisters who share something

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.479
unique.

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:52.880
All of them are wives of brothers who serve as members of the United States branch committee.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.640
Sister Snyder, we'd like to get to know more about you.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.640
Can you please first tell us how you got the truth?

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.239
I was introduced to the truth by my parents, and Jehovah used the example of my sister

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.760
and the nurturing love of older ones and the congregations to draw me to him.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.599
Then how did you start in the full-time ministry and then into Bethel service?

00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:19.400
Well, it was a bit of a test when I was in my late teens, a friend of mine died, and

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.439
I couldn't understand why Jehovah would allow this to happen to such a kind person.

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.159
So an elderly pioneer sister encouraged me to do deeper research on the issue of universal

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:38.640
sovereignty, and this not only comforted me, but it caused me to re-evaluate my priorities

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:46.560
and to see if I truly believed Jehovah would take care of me if I really put him first.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.879
So I started pioneering, put college on hold, and it wasn't long before I was broke and

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:55.519
the rent was coming due.

00:01:55.519 --> 00:02:02.480
And so the next meeting, I quietly put my last $50 in the contribution box and thought,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.480
what's it?

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.480
It doesn't work.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.840
I'm going back to school.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:14.960
But that evening, I learned that Matthew 633 is undeniably true.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:21.080
Jehovah surprised me and cared for all my needs from the most unlikely sources, and

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.280
he hasn't stopped caring for me since.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.360
And then you joined Troy in Bethel Service later on, right?

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.159
Now, what assignments have you enjoyed at Bethel?

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:36.919
I've enjoyed housekeeping, really enjoyed a lot of assignments within transportation department,

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:40.680
and I was one of thousands who worked on the Warwick and Tuxedo construction projects.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.840
Now, as the wife of a branch committee member, you have a demanding schedule.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.840
Can you explain one challenge?

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.680
Well, like most wives of good shepherds, I would love to have more time with my husband.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.280
That's understandable.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.479
So what practical things have you done to deal with that challenge?

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:05.360
Well, prayer, study, and meditation has reminded me that we're at spiritual war.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.120
And we're at war, our priorities have to change.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.240
So I can't long for ideal circumstances, although they're coming quickly.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.960
Right now, it's about advancing pure worship.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:23.639
And while it's important to maintain a healthy and close relationship with Troy, my primary

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.199
joy should be in Jehovah.

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:32.159
And then second, is remembering the sacrifices that were made for me.

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:36.960
Of course, Jehovah gave up 33 years with his best friend for me.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.879
And also, there were sisters when I was single and pioneering who would invite me over

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:46.240
for lots of meals, go out and serve us.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.520
They would even send their husband out and freeze and cold dark nights to fix my car,

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.199
which broke down often.

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:56.080
So I'm grateful.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:02.280
And the only, the main way I can show this appreciation is to imitate their examples.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.479
Now with challenges come blessings.

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:08.719
What's one blessing you enjoy as the wife of a branch committee member?

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:15.879
Most peace that comes from having complete confidence in how Jehovah directs and blesses

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:20.720
the decisions his organization makes through the governing body.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:27.279
If I were not married to a branch committee member, I may never have known just how much

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:33.560
the brothers rely on Jehovah spirit and how much time they spend long periods of time

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.439
in prayer and how much they deeply, deeply love the friends.

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:44.600
So I'm embarrassed about how much worrying I've done in the past about these things.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:50.959
But now it's a lot easier to just be supportive and listen obey and be blessed.

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:51.959
Very nice.

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:55.480
Now as you look back on your rich spiritual life in Jehovah's service, is there an experience

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.720
you can share with us?

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.319
We were visiting a small branch in a developing country that had been ravaged by decades

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:04.319
of civil war.

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:07.519
I'd never seen poverty like that before.

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:12.759
And one evening, I went into the dining room to gather dinner for us.

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:16.399
But before getting the dinner, I stopped and talked to a lovely young brother.

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:20.160
At one point, I turned around and noticed that all the food had been taken.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.680
And I said, there's no more food.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.879
Now this young brother hadn't eaten either, but he just shrugged and said, it's just hunger

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:33.759
and continued to zealously talking about his assignment.

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:39.519
Now this brother was a commuter, very thin, and so it was likely that he might not eat

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:42.560
that night or maybe even the next morning.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:49.639
But the way his face glowed when he talked about his assignment, it was clear that his

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:54.360
joy was not based on anything physical or the lack of anything physical.

00:05:55.319 --> 00:06:01.160
So I really treasure this lesson because it's made me want to more appreciate what I

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:07.759
do have currently and to imitate his example and focusing on what's truly important.

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:11.879
And I think you told me that he did get some food that night, so we're happy about that.

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:16.199
Thanks for letting us to get to know you and for sharing that experience.

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:18.839
Now we'd like to get to know Sister Sherelle George's.

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:22.160
Sister George's, can you tell us how you got the truth?

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:25.720
When I was 11, my mother started to study.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:31.240
Another sister studied with my two sisters and myself out of the book from Paradise Lost

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.160
to Paradise Regained.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:40.839
Two years later, on November 13, 1971, my mother, my oldest sister and myself were baptized.

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:43.360
How did you start in the full-time ministry?

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:49.240
As teenagers, a pioneer couple assisted us when we temporary or vacation pioneered as

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.399
it was called then.

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:55.199
It led me to want to regular pioneer after high school.

00:06:55.199 --> 00:07:00.360
However, after graduating, I started working full-time.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:06.519
It was at a district convention where the point was made, if you're not pioneering,

00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:08.319
tell Jehovah why.

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:11.319
Well, I really didn't have a good reason.

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:14.519
So I started making plans to work part-time.

00:07:14.519 --> 00:07:19.560
It was in September of 1980 when I realized my goal of regular pioneering.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.920
And how did that lead to Bethel service?

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.720
While pioneering, I had the opportunity to assist with the Brooklyn Assembly Hall renovation

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.720
project on Thursdays.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.319
It was one Thursday I learned of an announcement made at Bethel.

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:35.319
Sisters could now commute.

00:07:35.319 --> 00:07:41.600
So after a while, I turned in my application and started commuting in November of 1987.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.199
But before commuting, I had met Luther.

00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:49.959
We started to court and then later we were married and accepted as a couple to Bethel.

00:07:49.959 --> 00:07:53.000
And what assignments have you enjoyed at Bethel?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.079
While commuting, I worked in a dry cleaning department and continued there after marriage.

00:07:59.079 --> 00:08:02.639
For a short time, I worked with the Brooklyn Warehouse Department.

00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:06.079
Then Luther and I received a surprise assignment.

00:08:06.079 --> 00:08:11.639
We were asked to assist at the Jamaica branch starting in March of 1995.

00:08:11.639 --> 00:08:20.279
There I worked in alterations, laundry, kitchen, housekeeping, shipping, and Bethel office.

00:08:20.279 --> 00:08:25.360
Then in 2014, the Jamaica branch merged with the United States branch.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:29.759
We were invited to serve back in the United States, first at Patterson, where I worked

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:35.559
in audio video services and now at Wal-Kill in service department.

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:37.720
Now you two have a demanding schedule.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.120
Can you explain one challenge?

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.960
Many of the assignments that Luther has involves traveling.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:48.240
So that means that we're away from our congregation sometimes for weeks.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:54.879
It also means that we're not able to get back to our return visits and Bible studies on a weekly basis.

00:08:54.879 --> 00:08:58.039
So what practical things have you done to deal with that challenge?

00:08:58.039 --> 00:09:02.159
We found it helpful to let the friends know whenever we would be away.

00:09:02.159 --> 00:09:06.679
Many times we would receive a text from them, just saying hi, checking on you,

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:08.240
hope you're doing well.

00:09:08.279 --> 00:09:11.600
This really helped us to stay connected.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:17.799
What else we did was to invite publishers to go with us on our return visits and Bible studies.

00:09:17.799 --> 00:09:21.759
This way, whenever we were away, they could keep the interest going.

00:09:21.759 --> 00:09:23.519
That's a good idea.

00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:29.080
What good habits did you form early in life that help you now as you support your husband?

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:33.879
Growing up, my mother taught us to be content and to share whatever we had.

00:09:33.879 --> 00:09:36.799
One watched our articles stated,

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.759
true contentment comes from loving and being loved.

00:09:40.759 --> 00:09:47.039
We grew up in a loving family and then learning about Jehovah and his love as I grew older

00:09:47.039 --> 00:09:50.320
helped me to find contentment in Jehovah's service.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:56.480
So whatever assignment I have, I tried to be content and view any differences as an opportunity

00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:04.720
for me to learn about the various aspects, unique personalities and qualities of my brothers and sisters.

00:10:04.759 --> 00:10:10.240
Now, as you look back on your rich spiritual life, is there a memory you can share with us?

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.120
Proverbs 10-22 says,

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.600
the blessings of Jehovah, that is what makes one rich.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:20.600
I feel as if I have been enriched in so many ways with so many memories.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:27.159
One memory is being able to assist in the form of Jamaica branch for over 19 years.

00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:34.039
Working together with the brothers was such a unique privilege and really encouraging.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:41.000
To see the brothers exhibit their faith in loyalty in Jehovah despite various challenging circumstances

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.320
was a true encouragement for us.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:48.279
We made many friends and add assignment and we continue to keep in touch to this day.

00:10:48.279 --> 00:10:51.720
That is a nice memory. Thanks for sharing that with us.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.840
Finally, we'd like to talk to Sister Sonny Chiki.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:59.080
Sister Chiki, can you tell us how you got the truth and then entered the full-time ministry?

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.600
My mother raised me and my two brothers to serve Jehovah.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:08.519
It was difficult for her because my father left the truth and our family when we were very young,

00:11:08.519 --> 00:11:11.200
but she said a very good example for us.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.879
And then because of the encouragement of young pioneers in our congregation,

00:11:15.879 --> 00:11:24.000
I began regular pioneering in the Pasadena, California congregation after I graduated from high school in 1962.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.279
And how did that lead to Bethel's service?

00:11:26.279 --> 00:11:30.639
I served in a few other areas where the need was great in New Mexico,

00:11:30.639 --> 00:11:34.480
Northern California, a special pioneer of Simon and Iowa,

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.840
and then a small congregation in Mississippi.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:43.679
Tom was a Brooklyn Bethelite and he came down to Mississippi to dedicate a kingdom hall.

00:11:43.679 --> 00:11:50.240
In May 1981, we met seven months later, we were married,

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.200
and we were accepted to serve as a couple at Bethel.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.399
Nice. What assignments have you enjoyed at Bethel?

00:11:56.399 --> 00:11:59.039
I was a housekeeper for my first three years.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.919
Now I've been in Laundry for 35 years.

00:12:01.919 --> 00:12:06.240
I did have a part-time assignment in grounds maintenance for a while,

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:10.399
but now I joyfully serve full-time in the walk-yo laundry.

00:12:10.399 --> 00:12:14.399
Now you two have a demanding schedule. Can you explain one challenge?

00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:19.120
Meeting so many wonderful friends in our assignments, I like to keep in touch with them,

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:24.639
but time is so limited, so I feel that that can be overwhelming at times.

00:12:24.639 --> 00:12:27.440
So what practical thing have you done to deal with that challenge?

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.000
Well, I love to write cards and send letters,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.159
so that's how I deal with this and to be able to keep in touch with my friends,

00:12:34.159 --> 00:12:36.159
and that really helps a lot.

00:12:36.159 --> 00:12:39.519
So what has helped you to be balanced despite your busy schedule?

00:12:39.519 --> 00:12:43.679
I love the March 2016 broadcast that stressed three things.

00:12:44.879 --> 00:12:46.559
First is count your blessings.

00:12:46.559 --> 00:12:51.279
We are part of an amazing organization that is caring on the most meaningful work

00:12:51.279 --> 00:12:52.480
of preaching and teaching.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.320
Second is look at the big picture.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:00.799
When I feel stressed out, I try to put things in the right perspective,

00:13:00.799 --> 00:13:06.399
Jehovah Sovereignty first, foremost, and not focusing on myself,

00:13:06.399 --> 00:13:08.639
and that helps me to keep calm.

00:13:09.519 --> 00:13:11.600
And third was get enough rest.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:17.039
Without enough rest, I can't think straight and even ordinary activities

00:13:17.039 --> 00:13:20.720
in my routine seem overwhelming or too much.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.000
That's very practical.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.639
Now, is there a particular experience you'd like to share with us?

00:13:25.519 --> 00:13:27.919
When I was special pioneering in Iowa,

00:13:27.919 --> 00:13:32.320
I married a brother who was a pioneer and then became an elder,

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.480
and so I continued in the congregation as a regular pioneer.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:40.000
After several years, he became an apostate,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.840
and he tried to encourage me to go with him, but I refused.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:48.320
The elders made great efforts to help him to recover,

00:13:48.879 --> 00:13:52.159
but he was persistent in carrying out his course.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:56.320
So in time, he separated from me and ended the marriage.

00:13:56.879 --> 00:14:00.159
But I felt Jehovah's support in so many ways.

00:14:00.159 --> 00:14:04.080
One in particular was a couple who would call me often,

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.759
and they would have me to their home,

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.159
and they never wanted me to feel alone.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:12.080
Then another blessing came later when I moved to Mississippi,

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:16.720
and I became partners with a sister who was 20 years older than me.

00:14:17.279 --> 00:14:19.519
She had been in the seventh class of Gilead,

00:14:20.159 --> 00:14:23.440
and she had been special pioneering for 30 years.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.480
So you can imagine she was a tremendous help to me.

00:14:27.279 --> 00:14:30.159
More blessings came later when I married Tom,

00:14:30.159 --> 00:14:32.159
and began serving at Bethel.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.759
So feeling Jehovah's support at a difficult time

00:14:35.759 --> 00:14:38.559
and experiencing his blessings is unforgettable.

00:14:39.039 --> 00:14:42.159
Sister Chikki, thank you so much for sharing that experience with us.

00:14:43.679 --> 00:14:46.720
In the introduction, we referenced the example of Phoebe,

00:14:46.799 --> 00:14:48.480
that faithful Christian sister.

00:14:49.519 --> 00:14:52.320
Interestingly, Archingdom's song, number 137,

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:55.279
entitled Faithful Women Christian Sisters,

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.960
is based on the description of Phoebe at Romans 16-2.

00:15:00.159 --> 00:15:06.159
The lyrics of that song remind us that our Christian sisters show a faithful spirit we all can imitate.

00:15:06.879 --> 00:15:09.039
And that's true of the sisters we interviewed today.

00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:11.759
The song concludes with the words,

00:15:11.919 --> 00:15:13.519
Christian sisters,

00:15:13.519 --> 00:15:16.799
May Jehovah keep you firm in your conviction.

00:15:16.799 --> 00:15:19.519
Your prize is drawing near.

00:15:19.519 --> 00:15:25.519
How we appreciate the example set by all of our faithful Christian sisters.

00:15:25.519 --> 00:15:29.870
Thank you, brother Myers.

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:31.789
We thank you sisters as well.

00:15:31.789 --> 00:15:35.470
There are so many faithful wives around the world

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:39.470
who support their husbands who are putting Kingdom Mentors first.

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:43.149
We thank you and pray for all of you.

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:49.549
Now we have the pleasure of hearing from another member of the governing body

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:51.230
for the Garrett Loosh.

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:55.549
He will speak on the subject, we do not give up.

00:15:57.679 --> 00:16:00.639
For the Loosh, we look forward to your discussion.

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:05.710
Some of us have been in the truth for 40 years,

00:16:06.269 --> 00:16:08.990
50 years, 60 years, or more.

00:16:10.029 --> 00:16:15.070
During our life, we may have been confronted with various tests or challenges.

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:20.590
Still, we did not and we do not give up the truth

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:24.110
and our precious relationship with our Heavenly Father.

00:16:25.389 --> 00:16:28.590
Also, we do not give up preaching the Word of God.

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:36.669
Second Corinthians chapter 4, 16 is the theme scripture I've selected for this talk.

00:16:37.389 --> 00:16:39.389
Please locate that with me.

00:16:40.029 --> 00:16:42.830
Second Corinthians 4, 16.

00:16:45.759 --> 00:16:49.759
It says, therefore, we do not give up.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.919
But even if the man we are outside is wasting away,

00:16:53.919 --> 00:16:58.240
certainly the man we are inside is being renewed from day to day.

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:03.570
As it said, we do not give up.

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:07.569
And we do not give in when it comes to temptations.

00:17:08.529 --> 00:17:15.170
First Peter 3, 6, encourages us to not give in to fear.

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:21.809
Deuteronomy 13, 6 tells the Israelites that when a false prophet becomes active,

00:17:22.369 --> 00:17:25.970
you must not give in to him or listen to him.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:32.400
In the sermon on the Mount, according to an alternate rendering,

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.519
Jesus told his listeners to pray to Jehovah

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:40.400
not allow us to give in to temptation.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.799
On one occasion, Peter encouraged others,

00:17:45.599 --> 00:17:47.599
quote, first Peter 3, 6,

00:17:47.599 --> 00:17:49.440
do not give in to fear.

00:17:51.519 --> 00:17:55.200
We do give ear when somebody gives us good counsel.

00:17:56.079 --> 00:18:00.480
We give serious thought when somebody wants to help us.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.839
We give comfort to those in need.

00:18:04.319 --> 00:18:10.000
In the first century, Paul gave comfort to the congregation in Corinth.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.319
Please find second Corinthians 4, 1.

00:18:14.319 --> 00:18:19.599
We can read together and it says there.

00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:26.980
Therefore, since we have this ministry

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:32.579
through the mercy that was shown us, we do not give up.

00:18:32.579 --> 00:18:36.559
So who were the we?

00:18:37.519 --> 00:18:38.319
The anointed.

00:18:39.359 --> 00:18:42.319
Second Corinthians 3, verse 3,

00:18:44.319 --> 00:18:46.319
tells the Corinthians,

00:18:47.519 --> 00:18:49.119
there was the words of Paul,

00:18:49.759 --> 00:18:55.359
that they are like a letter of Christ written by him and his friends as ministers,

00:18:56.079 --> 00:18:59.200
inscribed with the spirit of our living God.

00:19:01.119 --> 00:19:06.400
The Apostle Daniel, verse 5, humbly acknowledges that the fact that he and the

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:12.160
Corinthians were qualified came from God and in verse 6,

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:18.559
that he has adequately qualified Christians to be ministers of a new covenant.

00:19:20.589 --> 00:19:23.390
What did Paul refer to when he said in verse 1,

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:27.470
since we have this ministry?

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:34.589
He referred to the ministry of that new covenant of which he was just talking about.

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:42.750
Please follow the reading of 2nd Corinthians chapter 3, verses 5 and 6,

00:19:45.549 --> 00:19:52.589
not that we ourselves are adequately qualified to consider that anything comes from us,

00:19:53.150 --> 00:20:00.990
but our being adequately qualified comes from God, who has indeed adequately qualified us to be

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:07.869
ministers of a new covenant, not of a written code but of spirit.

00:20:10.829 --> 00:20:13.789
In 2nd Corinthians 3, 18, he says,

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:20.589
and all of us, while we reflect like mirrors the glory of Jehovah.

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:28.190
Well, who did he refer to when he wrote all of us? He meant all of the anointed.

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:32.190
In chapter 4, verse 1, he says,

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:37.230
therefore, since we have this ministry through the mercy that was shown us,

00:20:39.069 --> 00:20:47.390
the expression, therefore, refers back to the reason and motivation for the anointed, not to give up.

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:57.630
In chapter 3, verse 18, he refers to the anointed as being transformed from one degree of glory to another.

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:02.190
Calminating in the glory they receive when entering heaven.

00:21:04.029 --> 00:21:09.549
Since the anointed are progressing from glory to glory until going to heaven,

00:21:09.549 --> 00:21:18.029
they have a strong motivation not to give up, but endure since there's such a precious price

00:21:18.029 --> 00:21:26.269
or reward ahead of them. Understandably, Paul said in chapter 4, verse 1,

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:34.829
therefore, we do not give up. Also in 2nd Corinthians 4, 16, Paul wrote,

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:44.589
therefore, we do not give up. In the third chapter, Paul contrasts the old covenant that was

00:21:44.589 --> 00:21:50.509
stripped of glory with the new covenant that would, like verse 10 and 11, says,

00:21:50.509 --> 00:21:54.750
Excel with greater glory, a glory that would remain.

00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:59.150
And 2nd Corinthians 3, 12, says,

00:22:00.029 --> 00:22:08.430
since we have such a hope, what hope? The heavenly hope. Did you note the similarity with

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:17.869
chapter 4, verse 1? It said, since we have this ministry, what ministry was Paul referring to,

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:27.230
was he referring to field ministry in a general sense? No. He referred to the ministry of the new

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:35.710
covenant. In chapter 3, verse 7, he then calls the ministry of the new covenant a treasure.

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:42.750
Since we have this treasure, he said, not just any treasure.

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:51.470
It was a great incentive for the anointed in the first century to not give up in view of this

00:22:51.470 --> 00:23:00.349
treasure of the new covenant that involves progressive glory. Paul wrote, therefore, we do not give

00:23:00.349 --> 00:23:09.500
up. Also, the context of the next verses shows that Paul was writing about the heavenly calling

00:23:09.579 --> 00:23:18.140
that the new covenant made possible. What Paul wrote is a strong incentive for anointed today

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:27.500
to not give up. What about the great crowd of other sheep? Paul did not have the great crowd in

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:35.259
mind when he wrote the words of 2nd Corinthians, chapter 3 and 4. In the introduction to his letter,

00:23:35.259 --> 00:23:45.019
he referred to, quote, all the holy ones. In 2nd Corinthians 1, 21 and 22, he says, quote,

00:23:45.579 --> 00:23:55.380
who anointed us is God. He has also put his seal on us. However, the great crowd is a recipient

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:59.140
of the radiant blessings of the ministry of the new covenant.

00:24:00.099 --> 00:24:06.579
Some time ago, the watchtower made a general application in principle to the great crowd.

00:24:06.579 --> 00:24:14.339
Just like the anointed have the treasure of the new covenant and its ministry, the great crowd

00:24:14.339 --> 00:24:23.940
considers their ministry also a treasure. The great crowd is also determined not to give up in view

00:24:24.019 --> 00:24:32.579
of a beautiful hope to live forever in paradise on earth. And all of us, no matter what hope,

00:24:32.579 --> 00:24:40.420
have to endure. Paul wrote in 2nd Corinthians chapter 4 verse 8 that we are

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:52.980
hard pressed, some more than others. Please find Psalm 90 verse 10. None of us are exempt from the

00:24:53.779 --> 00:25:05.019
pressures that can cause discouragement. And it says there, the span of our life is 70 years,

00:25:05.019 --> 00:25:10.539
or 80 if one is especially strong, but they are filled with trouble and sorrow.

00:25:11.099 --> 00:25:20.259
They quickly pass by and away we fly. Because of the pressures of life and disappointments,

00:25:20.259 --> 00:25:26.500
most of us grow weary at times. But we must remember that God never promised that we would have

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:32.900
a problem-free life in this old system. Even in the first century, God's servants faced

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:41.059
adversities, including persecution and poverty. Jehovah does allow his servants to be tempted and

00:25:41.059 --> 00:25:50.099
tested. For the time of the end, he also foretold earthquakes, wars, increased lawlessness,

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:59.539
and pestilences, according to Luke 21, 11. In Revelation, he foretold that a figurative horseman

00:25:59.539 --> 00:26:06.500
on the pale horse will kill a large amount of people. This happened for decades now,

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:14.500
but started with a Spanish flu at the end of World War I, where an estimated 500 million were

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:20.579
affected, one third of her mankind of that time, and about 50 million died.

00:26:22.579 --> 00:26:28.500
Satan exploits our moments of discouragement, just as a lion takes advantage of an animal when

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:36.579
it is most vulnerable. But we will not give up. We will not give up if others disappoint us.

00:26:38.099 --> 00:26:43.859
In Bible times, even the most faithful servants of Jehovah may have felt weighed down at times.

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:54.099
I have grown weary with my siding, wrote David. All night long, I make my couch swim,

00:26:54.099 --> 00:27:04.339
with my tears I make my own d'Ivan overflow. Why did David feel that way? Because of all those

00:27:04.339 --> 00:27:11.539
showing hostility to me, he explained. The hurtful actions of others cause David such pain of

00:27:11.539 --> 00:27:19.619
heart that his tears flowed freely. Still, David did not draw away from Jehovah because of what

00:27:19.619 --> 00:27:29.630
fellow humans had done to him. And neither do we. Similarly, the words or actions of others may

00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:36.509
cause as much pain of heart. There exists the one speaking thoughtlessly as with the stabs of

00:27:36.509 --> 00:27:45.460
swords as Proverbs 12, 18. When the thoughtless one is a Christian brother or sister, the stab wound

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:52.019
can go deep. The human tendency may be to take offense, perhaps harboring resentment.

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:58.740
This is especially true if we feel that we have been treated unkindly or unjustly.

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:06.660
We may find it hard to talk to the offender. We might even deliberately avoid him or her.

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:15.220
Wait down with resentment. Some have given up and have stopped coming to Christian meetings.

00:28:16.819 --> 00:28:23.059
How can we avoid playing into the devil's hands when others disappoint or hurt us?

00:28:24.259 --> 00:28:31.539
We must try not to harbor resentment. It can hurt us so much that we start suffering from depression.

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:39.940
Instead of giving into depression or aggression, take the initiative to make peace or

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:49.859
settle matters as quickly as possible. Colossians 3, 13 urges us. Continue for giving one another

00:28:49.859 --> 00:28:59.869
freely if anyone has a cause for a complaint against another. We do not have to fall prey to Satan.

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:07.150
Jehovah and Jesus are on our side. How can we find encouragement to endure?

00:29:08.109 --> 00:29:16.990
Jehovah deeply cares about those who may be discouraged. Acts 17, 27 shows he is not far off from

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:25.470
each one of us. Jehovah comforts and strengths of us through loving brothers and through his spirit

00:29:25.549 --> 00:29:32.190
and his word. Reading the Bible daily and meditating upon it helps.

00:29:33.309 --> 00:29:40.910
The publications have encouraged us to read the Bible through once a year. Why not make it your

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:50.240
resolve to try such a program? National Dory and anointed brother from Albania who persevered

00:29:50.319 --> 00:29:59.039
on the ban said, My goal was to read the Bible for at least one hour each day, which I did for

00:29:59.039 --> 00:30:09.730
some 60 years before my eyesight failed. Was he bragging when saying this? No. It helped him not to

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:18.849
give up under the extreme communist dictatorship. We do not necessarily expect you to read the Bible

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:26.289
for one hour each day, but we encourage you to read it through in one year and read it slowly

00:30:26.289 --> 00:30:33.970
enough that you can meditate on it. About 20 minutes a day provides ample opportunity to read and

00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:41.250
meditate on what you read. If you read so you hear your own voice, it will help you to read

00:30:41.329 --> 00:30:50.609
slower and to meditate. We also find encouragement through his organization, things we read in the literature

00:30:50.609 --> 00:30:58.130
or magazines, and we greatly benefit from the congregation meetings. We also benefit from

00:30:58.130 --> 00:31:06.690
sweet association with our brothers. We live or we are television, so do not give up.

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:16.049
Elders, when they shepherd, are also a big help for many to persevere. Publishers in our

00:31:16.049 --> 00:31:24.049
congregation do a lot to strengthen us. According to Hebrews 10.25, it is God's will that we keep

00:31:24.049 --> 00:31:32.769
encouraging one another and doing so is more urgent now than ever before. Let us always keep

00:31:32.769 --> 00:31:43.329
in mind the inspired words of 2nd Thessalonians 313. For you apart, brothers, do not give up

00:31:43.329 --> 00:31:52.450
in doing good. Galatians 6.9 similarly says, quote, let us not give up in doing what is fine,

00:31:52.450 --> 00:32:02.190
for in due time we will reap. What do we conclude from this? It is the words of our theme text,

00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:13.859
2nd Corinthians 416. We do not give up. Thank you, Brother Loosh. May we all be determined to

00:32:13.859 --> 00:32:20.980
follow that scriptural advice and not give up, no matter what we face ahead during these last days.

00:32:22.259 --> 00:32:26.819
And we'd like to remind all of you that the concluding segment of the annual meeting

00:32:26.819 --> 00:32:36.819
will be posted on February 1st, 2021 right here on JW Broadcasting.
