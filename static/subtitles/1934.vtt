00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:20.460
One year ago, Jehovah told Abraham something that seemed impossible.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:47.880
His wife Sarah would have a son.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:59.890
Sarah's miraculous pregnancy and Isaac's birth were proof that Jehovah's word always comes true.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:25.849
As the rains came down, there they were, eight souls, safe on the ark.

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:30.379
Jehovah protected Noah's family.

00:01:30.379 --> 00:01:32.379
That's why we're alive today.

00:01:32.379 --> 00:01:39.540
And you know, that's not the only time.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:50.969
There have been many things that seem scary, but Jehovah always makes sure his promises come true.

00:01:51.969 --> 00:02:00.590
Think how he helped to protect your mother when Pharaoh wanted to take her as his wife.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.859
Think how he sent angels to save a lot.

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:10.180
Remember, he caused your birth.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.180
I'm your father.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.180
But Jehovah's your father too.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.180
You were part of his purpose, Isaac.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.180
Hard things are going to happen.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.180
But remember, we can always trust Jehovah.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.180
He always keeps his promises.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.180
That's right.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.180
Remember the promise Jehovah made to our family?

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.180
I will give to you.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.180
And to your offspring after you, the land in which you lived is a lasting possession.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.870
And I will be their God.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:45.870
Come here.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:03:04.949
Hard things did happen, even in this spiritual housework.

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:26.900
This wasn't just a sibling rivalry.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.900
Ishmael's abusive behavior had broken Sarah's heart.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.939
I asked that slave girl and her son.

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:48.289
Do not be displeased by what Sarah is saying to you.

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:51.289
About the boy and about your slave girl.

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:53.289
Listen to her.

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:58.289
For what will be called your offspring will be through Isaac.

00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:05.289
As for the son of the slave girl, I will also make a nation out of him because he is your offspring.

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:19.660
Though it was hard, Abraham obediently sent Heger and his son Ishmael away.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:25.389
Trusting that Jehovah had his eyes upon them.

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:54.819
Take, please, your son, your only son whom you so love, Isaac.

00:04:54.819 --> 00:05:57.509
And travel to the land of Mariah and offer him up there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains that I will designate to you.

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:02.290
Let's go.

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:09.290
In the past, Abraham had asked God questions about some of his judgments and decisions.

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:14.290
But now, his friendship and trust in Jehovah had grown.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:17.290
He didn't ask anything at all.

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:22.579
You stay here with the donkey.

00:06:22.579 --> 00:06:25.579
The boy and I will go over there and worship and return to you.

00:06:25.579 --> 00:06:39.589
Father, yes, my son.

00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:44.189
Here is the fire and the wood.

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:48.189
But where is the sheep for the burnt offering?

00:06:48.189 --> 00:07:01.629
God himself will provide the sheep for the burnt offering, my son.

00:07:01.629 --> 00:09:14.470
Abraham.

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:16.470
There he is.

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:18.470
Do not harm the boy.

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:22.470
Do not do anything at all to him.

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:27.470
For now, I do know that you are God-fearing.

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:30.470
Because you have not withheld your son.

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.470
You are only one from me.

00:09:32.470 --> 00:10:40.860
And by means of your offspring, all nations of the earth will obtain a blessing for themselves.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:44.860
Because you have listened to my voice.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:54.200
Abraham and Sarah and Isaac all knew they could have full faith in Jehovah.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:58.200
His promises to them are promises to us.
