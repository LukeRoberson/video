00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.160
Have you applied to the School for Kingdom Evangelizers, but not been invited, or have

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.719
you wanted to apply, but wondered if the time was right?

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.880
You are not alone.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.320
Because of the pandemic, classes are still suspended.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.000
But if you are a pioneer between the ages of 23 and 65 and would like to attend a future

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.600
class of SKE, please contact your congregation secretary and fill out the online application

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.590
so that it can be considered when class is resumed.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.030
As a reminder, your application is active for one year.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.189
Therefore, you must apply each year that you desire to be considered.

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:15.590
Additionally, we are pleased to inform you that graduates of the Ministerial Training School

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.629
or the Bible School for Single Brothers who are still single and in full-time service

00:01:21.629 --> 00:01:29.159
may now apply for the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.480
Is it possible to maintain our peace when dealing with intense trials and pressures?

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.840
How does Jehovah care for our needs when we are in distress?

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.760
The following video will introduce us to brothers and sisters who have been blessed by Jehovah

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.280
with peace.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:56.799
The theme is, how our brothers are enjoying peace despite opposition, illness, economic

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:08.120
problems, and natural disasters.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:15.919
As long as we live in Satan's world, all of us will face situations that can rob us

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:18.039
of our peace.

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:23.759
Regaining that peace can be difficult, but not impossible.

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:30.719
In this video, we will hear from three sisters and two couples who will speak candidly

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:36.319
about their trials and how they struggle to cope with them.

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:44.439
But in spite of what they have endured, please take note of their smiles, their joy,

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:49.479
what they did to regain or maintain their peace.

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:56.520
And take special note of how Jehovah helped them.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:03.240
The governing body knows that many of you are suffering circumstances not unlike the

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.840
ones we will hear about.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:13.360
And they trust that the examples in this video will help each of you to maintain your peace

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:22.560
as you endure various trials.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:35.110
These sisters all over the world are facing natural disasters, economic collapse, illness,

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:46.189
persecution, despite all that, they keep joy and peace.

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:50.400
I can learn a lot from them.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.879
My name is Antonelle.

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:59.939
I live here in Las Vegas, Nevada with my super mom and my troublemaking sister.

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:03.900
Many of my friends have always been important to me.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.139
As a child, I lived with my mom and dad, and I was very close to my dad's side of the

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:10.139
family.

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:16.420
It was very loving, unified, and fun.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:23.860
I was pretty happy, but Ari was starting to feel the effects of my cancer.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.060
We just didn't know what it was really.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:35.790
One day I was okay and the next day I started feeling bad, you know.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:41.259
In my childhood, I played in the usual game.

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:50.779
I would catch insects, put them in a jar, and then bring them home.

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:55.699
Then I would get books, such as a criminal procedural code.

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:58.699
Open them up and start judging one of the books.

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:04.689
I would play the role of investigator and judge at the same time.

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:11.850
I was born into a family where everyone, starting with my grandparents, was either wearing

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.370
an officer's uniform or a judge's robe.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:21.709
That's why I had this strong sense of justice.

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:34.579
But in 1989, my mother was in a tragic car accident, and she got severe burns on her face,

00:05:34.579 --> 00:05:37.860
ends, and body.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:47.259
Then my father, I'd seen my mom's condition, decided to leave us.

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:51.329
Yeah.

00:05:51.329 --> 00:06:01.410
And it was at that moment, I guess, that my world, my ideals, they crumbled.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:06.009
I, as a little kid, I always wanted, like, one big happy family.

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:11.129
Once we moved to New York for my treatment, I no longer had that big family bond anymore.

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:20.399
While I was feeling back then, in New York was just sadness.

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:26.870
Never really peace.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:35.660
Well here in California, we're used to fires.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:43.180
But when I got the call to evacuate that morning, I never knew by that evening, the whole

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:59.100
town of Paradise would be gone.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:04.620
Just before the fire, we had the needs of the congregation, where they instructed us

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:08.060
of what to do, in the case of a disaster.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.860
I had the truck full of gas.

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:18.579
I had my gold bag ready, and I had a map of where I was going.

00:07:18.579 --> 00:07:22.019
I was ready.

00:07:22.019 --> 00:07:27.540
The brothers also in their instructions said to obey the traffic instructors.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:32.540
The instructor told us to turn right, and I didn't want to turn right.

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.860
But they said, obey them.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:43.660
So I turned right, though I thought it'd be really bad.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:56.579
The smoke got darker and darker, and finally it got black.

00:07:56.579 --> 00:08:04.990
You couldn't see anything.

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:12.269
My mom always told me I've always been a caregiver ever since I was a little girl.

00:08:12.269 --> 00:08:15.709
It was just part of who I was.

00:08:15.709 --> 00:08:22.899
I don't like to see people suffer, it's very difficult for me.

00:08:22.899 --> 00:08:30.660
I remember when I first started working as a nurse, I would always cry.

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:38.639
I cried, literally I cried every day that I had to go to work.

00:08:38.639 --> 00:08:51.639
Not only was I overwhelmed being a new nurse, but also I was battling my depression.

00:08:51.639 --> 00:08:57.720
In 2017, I was the treasurer for a prestigious bank in Nicaragua, and I was the father of

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.519
a one-year-old son.

00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:06.700
We were very happy, but then I lost my job.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:13.259
So I said, I have the experience, and Jehovah will help me find another job.

00:09:13.259 --> 00:09:17.779
He's similar, and I kept looking for jobs, but doors kept closing.

00:09:17.779 --> 00:09:28.539
I felt very tense, it made me feel very useless, like I can't even provide for my family.

00:09:28.539 --> 00:09:38.620
It was something very difficult for me.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:44.139
These dear brothers and sisters face serious challenges.

00:09:44.139 --> 00:09:52.700
They may have had moments when they felt like job, when he said, I loath my life.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:57.500
That is not an unusual human emotion.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:06.059
Sometimes things in life don't work out as we had hoped, and it can hurt us deeply.

00:10:06.059 --> 00:10:11.460
Does this mean that we are helpless victims of our circumstances?

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.659
Not at all.

00:10:13.659 --> 00:10:21.779
Please pay close attention, and take note of why we can say that Margaret, Felix, Miguel,

00:10:21.779 --> 00:10:28.940
Nikki, and Antoinette are not helpless victims to the contrary.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.059
They are conquerors.

00:10:32.059 --> 00:10:40.659
As you watch and listen, look for specific actions they took to maintain their peace,

00:10:40.659 --> 00:10:50.220
and please give thoughtful attention to ways that you can imitate their faith.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:11:00.940
Growing up, I wondered, why does a supreme judge, God, allow injustice and suffering?

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:04.860
And inside of me, I had this need to restore justice.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:12.419
It was such a burning desire within me, and with that in mind, I moved to Russia to stay

00:11:12.419 --> 00:11:15.539
with my sister.

00:11:15.539 --> 00:11:22.980
She started to study the Bible, and was overflowing with the truth.

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:30.289
We talked for hours to lay into the night, so that's when my special relationship with

00:11:30.289 --> 00:11:33.860
Jehovah began.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:37.460
That's when I got a taste of what it's like to have a caring father.

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:43.830
It had been a while since I was able to feel that.

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:46.669
My baptism day was very exciting.

00:11:52.509 --> 00:11:58.509
The spiritual family I inherited was very vast.

00:11:58.509 --> 00:12:01.149
You can instantly feel the love.

00:12:01.149 --> 00:12:05.269
I got baptized, and it seemed like miracles happened.

00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:20.299
One after the other, we had a great life.

00:12:20.299 --> 00:12:26.259
And then the persecution started with Brother Christensen, and then there was a ripple effect

00:12:26.259 --> 00:12:27.940
of arrests.

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:31.340
One after the other, then it was our turn.

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:40.419
In June of 2018, a huge group of armed men came to us, to our home.

00:12:40.419 --> 00:12:45.620
They represented the ideals of my childhood.

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:57.409
But now these people, this judicial system became the source of injustice to me.

00:12:57.409 --> 00:13:05.559
I was sitting in a cage, the same way my bugs used to be in a jar.

00:13:05.559 --> 00:13:12.820
I guess I felt like they did in your head.

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:18.179
At that moment, when you hear the verdict that you'll stay in prison, it's like you've

00:13:18.179 --> 00:13:20.179
been knocked unconscious.

00:13:20.179 --> 00:13:28.330
You've been hit in the head with something, and there's just a ringing sound in your ears.

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:32.649
And so I was taken away in handcuffs.

00:13:32.649 --> 00:13:39.740
Of course, I wasn't in the best mood.

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:59.039
And then the doors of the elevator opened up, and in front of us, a lot of brothers and

00:13:59.039 --> 00:14:08.379
sisters clapping their hands as hard as they could, and some were crying, but not crying

00:14:08.379 --> 00:14:11.299
because they felt sorry for me.

00:14:11.299 --> 00:14:17.460
They cried because they loved us, and because they were proud of us.

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:22.340
That's what always happens when you're just about to lose all your strength.

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:27.659
You hover dust, that's something for you, that gives you a second wind.

00:14:27.659 --> 00:14:35.019
And so, they'll pause, the love, the tears, the shouts hanging there.

00:14:35.019 --> 00:14:37.500
Everything will be okay.

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:44.220
They gave me a second wind, and with renewed strength, I could run the next part of the

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:48.129
race.

00:14:48.129 --> 00:14:54.490
One of the guards was so surprised that he said, now that's some support you've got.

00:14:58.139 --> 00:15:01.620
Without friends, I would be very lonely.

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:05.139
I would constantly be focusing on my illness.

00:15:05.139 --> 00:15:11.980
The day I met Marissa was at a convention, she's a really great friend, a spiritual friend.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:15.620
When she takes me to my hospital appointments, we would eat out.

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:19.460
I think food is just the common language between everyone, you know.

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:23.659
When you talk about food, you know, like, yes, we have something to talk about, you know,

00:15:23.659 --> 00:15:27.259
I would be excited when she would take me to my hospital appointment.

00:15:27.259 --> 00:15:28.740
She always makes me laugh, you know.

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:33.299
She always helps me have a good time, no matter what.

00:15:33.299 --> 00:15:38.620
Again, friends really help encourage me.

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:45.580
Proverbs 17-17 says, a true friend shows love at all times, and is a brother who is born

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.779
for times of distress.

00:15:48.779 --> 00:15:52.379
And I have seen this come true in my life.

00:15:52.379 --> 00:15:59.539
When I lost my job at the bank, well, I felt very depressed, troubled, tense, and I have

00:15:59.539 --> 00:16:01.740
a good friend that I can talk to.

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:08.500
And when I told him how I was feeling, he told me, look Miguel, don't look for the same

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.899
line of work.

00:16:10.899 --> 00:16:15.179
Maybe what you need to do is make a change in your life.

00:16:15.179 --> 00:16:21.059
Why don't you find some simple work outside of an office for a time that can help you

00:16:21.059 --> 00:16:27.360
to keep your eye simple and allow you to provide for your family?

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:35.090
I watched my wife make bread for our family, and one day I told her, I'm going to make

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:37.450
that bread, but not for our family.

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:39.769
I'm going to make it to sell.

00:16:39.769 --> 00:16:43.450
So she told me, no, are you crazy?

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:50.649
It was a big change, right, from having a position at a bank and handling a lot of money

00:16:50.649 --> 00:16:52.769
to selling on the street.

00:16:52.769 --> 00:16:55.090
So I told her, look, I'm going to put this hat on.

00:16:55.090 --> 00:17:03.250
And I put like a chef's head on, and I told her, I'll be back in less than an hour.

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:06.250
Whether I sell or not, and that's what happened.

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:09.049
And to her surprise, I came back without any bread.

00:17:09.049 --> 00:17:14.450
So when I got ready to leave the second time to sell, she said, okay, go, but leave

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:35.420
the hat here.

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:40.339
I also started to iron clothes for people in their homes, and it looks strange because

00:17:40.339 --> 00:17:45.299
normally where we live, that type of work is done by a woman.

00:17:45.299 --> 00:17:50.380
But for a man to go and iron clothes at someone's home, you don't see that.

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:54.299
But I didn't want to just sit back with my arms crossed and see what would happen.

00:17:54.299 --> 00:18:01.700
No, I had to put my hands to work to earn a living for my family.

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:05.059
So I would preach one day, and the next day I would iron clothes.

00:18:05.059 --> 00:18:08.420
The next day I would preach, and the day after that I would go out and sell bread.

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:12.380
So my mind was always occupied on doing something, either for the kingdom or my family.

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:18.660
And that helped me a lot.

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:19.940
I was feeling so sad.

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:24.819
I really needed Jehovah's help to figure out what was going on with me.

00:18:24.819 --> 00:18:32.859
And I remember the 2009 article about depression came out.

00:18:32.859 --> 00:18:38.019
And I realized, okay, Jehovah, you're telling me, this is what I have.

00:18:38.019 --> 00:18:43.740
So now that I realize I have this, I got to figure out how I can manage it.

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:46.779
So I changed my eating habits.

00:18:46.779 --> 00:18:48.619
I started exercising a lot more.

00:18:48.619 --> 00:18:55.339
I realized that exercising and eating healthy really, really did help.

00:18:55.339 --> 00:19:03.099
Also I made a journal, and I made different sections of the different aspects of my depression

00:19:03.099 --> 00:19:04.900
that I dealt with.

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:13.140
Each section I would put scriptures, I would put articles and the illustrations, the pictures.

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:18.660
They speak, they speak a lot without saying anything.

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:22.460
Jehovah cares us.

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:30.970
Jehovah cares.

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:36.809
After some time in prison, they transferred me to a different cell.

00:19:36.809 --> 00:19:42.130
And it were inmates who followed the orders of the investigators.

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:46.049
They did everything they could to other inmates.

00:19:46.049 --> 00:19:50.130
They made life unbearable.

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:51.890
Why did they do this?

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:58.200
To break a person so that they would start to collaborate with the investigators, confess

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:07.140
to everything, and then be able to get transferred to another area.

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.740
Psalm 373.

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:13.660
Trust in Jehovah and do what is good.

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:17.900
I said, Jehovah, please help me to stay loyal to you.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:18.900
Please help me.

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:21.180
My prayers were really simple.

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:26.220
Actually like two words, Jehovah help, Jehovah help, Jehovah help.

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:33.259
Despite how they treated me, when I dealt with others, I tried to treat them with kindness.

00:20:33.259 --> 00:20:40.980
These people, they made life uncomfortable, unbearable.

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:45.940
But when they were treated kindly, they started to soften.

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:49.420
They began to treat me differently.

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:56.900
When I was being transferred out of that cell, the inmate that ran the area called me over

00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:01.500
to him and said, come sit beside me.

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:07.859
And I sat down, then he said, if anybody in this prison touches you, tell them that I'll

00:21:07.859 --> 00:21:12.339
come looking for him.

00:21:12.339 --> 00:21:16.460
Then he said, get his things.

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:18.980
He told the other prisoners.

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:28.710
The cell doors opened and the guards saw a crowd of inmates, graphing my things and putting

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:31.910
them out into the hallway.

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:36.470
I left the cell without having to carry a thing.

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:39.990
The guard quietly closed the door.

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:43.670
And before the inmates returned to their cells, they even said goodbye.

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:47.670
Hug me and said, hang in there, you're going to be okay.

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:52.230
They went into the cell and the guard closed the door and asked me, boy, how long have you

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:53.230
been in there?

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:57.470
I sit three weeks.

00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:01.869
He said, well normally people leave this cell beaten up and they're thrown out by the

00:22:01.869 --> 00:22:02.869
other inmates.

00:22:02.869 --> 00:22:06.349
They have to carry their own things and that's if the other inmates haven't thrown their

00:22:06.349 --> 00:22:08.990
stuff out the door.

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:12.109
He couldn't believe what had just happened.

00:22:13.109 --> 00:22:22.670
Exercising, changing my diet, the publications, journaling, that was my lifeline.

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:26.670
That really actually helped me for a long time.

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:31.789
But it came to a point where it stopped working as effectively.

00:22:31.789 --> 00:22:37.349
I remember getting ready for dress for the meeting and I was fine.

00:22:37.349 --> 00:22:41.670
Getting dressed for a meeting about to walk off the door but I couldn't.

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:46.390
There was this overwhelming fear that came over me and an overwhelming sadness that

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:49.990
came over me and I just lost it.

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:51.750
I just started crying.

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:55.630
I couldn't get myself together.

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:56.630
It was bad.

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:57.630
It got really bad.

00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:03.420
My depression got really bad.

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:08.940
So it was very difficult for me to approach the brothers to ask them for help.

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:19.839
But at that time I knew that if I didn't, that something bad would happen.

00:23:19.839 --> 00:23:21.440
So I decided, you know what?

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:24.440
I'm going to ask for a shout-out and call with my brothers because I never talked about

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.839
my depression with the elders at all.

00:23:26.839 --> 00:23:30.279
This was my first time speaking with them.

00:23:30.279 --> 00:23:38.839
And there was one brother, one of the elders who also battled depression and he suggested

00:23:38.839 --> 00:23:45.410
have you thought about seeking medical help.

00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:48.569
Being professional help was something I never wanted to do.

00:23:48.569 --> 00:23:56.609
I thought that I didn't need to do it but sometimes there comes a point where you need

00:23:56.609 --> 00:24:02.490
additional help and what you're doing is not enough.

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:07.849
In this world, they make you feel like it's a bad thing that depression is a dirty word

00:24:07.849 --> 00:24:12.049
or seeking medical help is something that you don't do.

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:19.210
I realized also that seeking medical help was part of my being able to worship Jehovah

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:20.210
effectively.

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:22.529
That's me doing my part.

00:24:22.529 --> 00:24:27.009
Not everyone needs to take that step but for me, this is what I need to do.

00:24:27.009 --> 00:24:38.410
And I'm glad I did it because the fact that I've never felt this good in my life.

00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:48.859
About a year later, we were released but my wife and I understood that they could put

00:24:48.859 --> 00:24:51.059
me back in prison again.

00:24:51.059 --> 00:25:00.049
So we needed to use a time until then to the fall in the best way possible.

00:25:00.049 --> 00:25:02.650
So what did we do?

00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:06.490
Psalm 119, 165.

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:11.769
Abundant peace belongs to those who love your law.

00:25:11.769 --> 00:25:19.529
We had family worship, read the Bible, and prayed together.

00:25:19.529 --> 00:25:27.920
That's how I spent my four months of freedom.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:37.660
Then I was put into prison for three years.

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:42.740
When they told me about my cancer being gone, I was really happy, I was ecstatic.

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:47.859
I was like, finally, I'm going to get to do normal things that kid my age should be

00:25:47.859 --> 00:25:48.859
able to do.

00:25:48.859 --> 00:25:57.460
I don't need to be afraid or anxious anymore.

00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:01.140
Unfortunately, I did relax again.

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:07.140
And basically right now, my private condition is there's nothing really more to do.

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:15.349
They're just waiting to let nature take its course, basically.

00:26:15.349 --> 00:26:19.549
That's it.

00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:27.190
Then harmony with Ephesians chapter 4 verse 26, I had to let myself process the news and

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:32.150
let myself be sad and agree.

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:35.670
Let yourself feel those feelings.

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:42.150
Do not try to repress them, but you can control your thoughts and your actions.

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:48.430
Pretty much my whole life has revolved around my illness, but I learned how to shift focus.

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:50.829
I just don't focus on myself all the time.

00:26:50.829 --> 00:26:52.430
I focus on others.

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:57.829
There are trials that are different, but just as hard.

00:26:57.829 --> 00:27:02.269
You read the stories on jw.org in the newsroom.

00:27:02.269 --> 00:27:09.670
The Russian brothers and sisters, I pray for them constantly because they are going through

00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:13.549
a very tough time.

00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:17.910
There is definitely more happiness in giving than receiving.

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:20.990
In our situation, this proved true.

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:28.150
I would say this really helps to relieve your pain.

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:32.029
If you focus on yourself, your pain gets worse.

00:27:32.029 --> 00:28:00.619
When you focus on others and on their problems, your pain lessons diminishes.

00:28:00.619 --> 00:28:09.569
Antonet, I was so, when I was told that we would talk with each other, this was something

00:28:09.569 --> 00:28:12.410
very special for me.

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:18.890
Same for me too, when the brothers told me about meeting you, I was really excited.

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:23.450
Thank you for your prayers on behalf of the brothers in Russia.

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:26.460
They are precious.

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:31.000
We can learn so much from you.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000
Thank you.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:40.799
It's really nice that you can say that we have both been through many hardships.

00:28:40.799 --> 00:28:44.480
I'm sure Pradhan was super hard.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:55.900
You know, in prison, us brothers had a saying, if you ask, how much worse can it get?

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:58.779
You won't have to wait long to find out.

00:28:58.779 --> 00:29:03.500
Or in other words, when you think how much worse can it get for sure something worse

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:06.220
is bound to happen.

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:11.259
And when we received our sentence, we thought, well, that's it.

00:29:11.259 --> 00:29:21.019
That's the worst that could happen.

00:29:21.019 --> 00:29:26.940
And then, of course, it got worse.

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:46.299
Upon arrival at the prison, we were beaten up and for hours, we were humiliated.

00:29:46.299 --> 00:29:52.579
We thought, how much worse can it get than the next day we were told, you're going

00:29:52.579 --> 00:29:54.859
to the punishment cell.

00:29:54.859 --> 00:30:01.180
We thought, well, how much worse can it get?

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:05.500
The first to start it with one floor, then I went to another floor.

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:13.430
And then the whole entire hospital, every floor, had COVID patients.

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:18.509
That was some of the hardest nursing that I've ever done in my life.

00:30:18.509 --> 00:30:25.869
And all my years of nursing, and we lost a lot of good nurses that were right in the

00:30:25.869 --> 00:30:29.589
trenches with me that were in there doing their best.

00:30:29.589 --> 00:30:32.109
We lost a lot of good people.

00:30:32.109 --> 00:30:37.829
And though I was on medication to help me, it still didn't take the depression away.

00:30:37.829 --> 00:30:39.990
You're like, what's the point?

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:41.710
I can't save anyone.

00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:46.230
I can't help anyone.

00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:47.470
It was devastating.

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:54.099
It truly, truly was devastating.

00:30:54.099 --> 00:31:02.819
Have you ever felt, as Felix did, when he asked, how much worse can it get?

00:31:02.819 --> 00:31:10.740
Nevertheless, a spiritual person can see each new challenge as an opportunity to rely

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:13.420
on Jehovah.

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:20.859
As we watch the concluding part of this video, please take note of how Jehovah strengthened

00:31:20.859 --> 00:31:27.019
these brothers and sisters and deepened their friendship with him.

00:31:27.019 --> 00:31:32.619
Think about your own circumstances and the ways that Jehovah has helped you through

00:31:32.619 --> 00:31:45.349
trials, and have full confidence that he will continue to do so.

00:31:45.349 --> 00:31:51.509
And then I decided that I was going to stop asking how worse it could get.

00:31:51.509 --> 00:32:01.279
I asked Jehovah for endurance, enjoy for that day, just for that day.

00:32:01.279 --> 00:32:12.160
And at those times, I just cry to Jehovah, talk to Jehovah about how I'm feeling and

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:18.470
to stop for his peace to help me to deal.

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:26.029
I've talked to Jehovah very intimately and personally, but never, like I have when I was

00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:36.220
so alone there, I realized that I was going to die.

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:43.819
I asked Jehovah, if he saw enough good in me, if he would just resurrect me, that I'd

00:32:43.819 --> 00:32:50.259
love to be in his new world and see my husband again and my children.

00:32:50.259 --> 00:32:55.500
And I thanked him so much for the life that I had.

00:32:55.500 --> 00:33:04.660
And I felt such a peace that I'd never felt before.

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:13.180
And then I just knew was Jehovah getting me out.

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:18.460
The obedience, just doing what we were told, it came from Jehovah and it was so simple

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:29.099
that gave him something to bless and it may have saved my life.

00:33:29.099 --> 00:33:36.660
I just never wanted to be a burden on people, but the brothers and sisters had come from

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:44.960
all over the country to work from this house, the other houses, all of them.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:51.119
They made me feel wanted and they made me feel loved.

00:33:51.119 --> 00:34:02.859
To feel like Jehovah cared enough to give attention to you, I just felt so unworthy and

00:34:02.859 --> 00:34:10.099
hear all these people are here taking care of me and you just look at them.

00:34:10.099 --> 00:34:15.139
And then you think, I'm part of this organization, I got to do better.

00:34:15.139 --> 00:34:25.019
I got to be like them and make other people happy.

00:34:25.019 --> 00:34:29.619
When I'm able to help people who are bottling depression, I feel like Jehovah is using

00:34:29.619 --> 00:34:31.139
me in that way.

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:35.500
And it makes me happy that I can be of use to Jehovah.

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:41.579
It's good to feel, it's so nice to feel good again, to feel happy again, to be able

00:34:41.579 --> 00:34:46.760
to smile, to be able to take enjoyment in the small things, you know, in Jehovah's

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:52.679
creation and, you know, just be happy that I'm alive.

00:34:52.679 --> 00:35:05.880
So yeah.

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:12.909
Now I have a stable job, I work at a hardware store, man, I feel like peace.

00:35:12.909 --> 00:35:18.110
The universities have made me stronger and overall, I have a much closer relationship

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:22.389
with Jehovah, but I'm still making bread.

00:35:22.389 --> 00:35:30.159
And at home, yeah, I'm the one who irons the clothes.

00:35:30.159 --> 00:35:34.800
After a while, I found out that I was being deported.

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:39.480
I remember getting off the train.

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:43.920
They took me through the back door, but my wife, Genia, was standing at the main entrance.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:50.039
She was on the phone, she couldn't see me, she was looking at the main entrance.

00:35:50.039 --> 00:35:55.800
And I threw my bag down as I ran to her.

00:35:55.800 --> 00:36:00.199
She could see from the corner of her eyes, someone was running.

00:36:00.199 --> 00:36:10.030
She was a little confused, even scared.

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:19.699
And there I was, hugging the person I loved the most.

00:36:19.699 --> 00:36:40.769
It was one of the most beautiful days of my life.

00:36:40.769 --> 00:36:50.250
When I heard that you were praying for us and for the brothers and sisters in Russia,

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:56.250
it really encouraged me and Felix, it's such an example for me personally.

00:36:56.250 --> 00:37:01.730
We mentioned it in our prayer yesterday, Felix was saying that you are a great example

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:08.900
of how we need to genuinely care for our brothers and sisters.

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:11.340
We love you very much.

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:25.010
Goodbye.

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:26.010
Good night.

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:27.010
Good night.

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:28.010
Good night.

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:29.010
Good night.

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:32.320
Good night.

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:40.159
My cancer's uncurable, but I know the cure isn't the new system, so that's the cure.

00:37:40.159 --> 00:37:49.280
I like to imagine when that time happens, what will I be doing?

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:54.239
Obviously, I'm going to be jumping for joy because I'm going to be rid of my cancer.

00:37:54.239 --> 00:37:58.039
I'm going to enjoy food that we never really got to enjoy.

00:37:58.039 --> 00:38:04.519
I'm going to have so many animals, I'm going to make a house, I'm going to learn how to

00:38:04.519 --> 00:38:07.519
make a house.

00:38:07.519 --> 00:38:22.840
Peace in this world is not the absence of illness, danger, persecution, or economic problems.

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:32.579
Peace in this world is listening to Jehovah's guidance, praying to Jehovah constantly,

00:38:32.579 --> 00:38:40.260
meditating on Jehovah's word, and his promises.

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:54.230
Peace in this world is also having good friends by our side, or having a good sense of humor.

00:38:54.230 --> 00:39:02.110
What I've learned from all of this is peace isn't from what's outside, from what's going

00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:04.909
on, or what you're experiencing.

00:39:04.909 --> 00:39:17.960
I've learned that peace is on the inside, and that comes from Jehovah.

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:26.119
These examples we've just seen are of ordinary people with feelings like ours.

00:39:26.119 --> 00:39:32.480
Yet they felt peace even when confronting serious trials.

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.960
How did they do it?

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:42.960
When Miguel lost his job, he kept his focus on serving Jehovah, and he was not too proud

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:47.800
to do humble work to provide for his family.

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:58.079
Margaret was prepared for a natural disaster, and throughout her ordeal she prayed to Jehovah.

00:39:58.079 --> 00:40:05.440
While struggling with depression, Nikki did research using our publications and asked

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:09.039
for help from the elders.

00:40:09.039 --> 00:40:16.599
Even when facing brutal persecution, Felix showed kindness to his persecutors.

00:40:16.599 --> 00:40:23.400
He knew that the way he responded would reflect Christian qualities.

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:34.239
And dear Antoinette, despite her diagnosis, focuses not on herself, but on helping others.

00:40:34.239 --> 00:40:43.420
As she said, the cure for her, as it is for all of us, is God's kingdom.

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:55.219
If you are experiencing trials, focus on what you can control, help others, be grateful,

00:40:55.219 --> 00:41:00.539
and rely on Jehovah and his organization.

00:41:00.539 --> 00:41:08.099
If you are not experiencing serious trials, do what you can to prepare for them by building

00:41:08.099 --> 00:41:11.699
yourself up spiritually.

00:41:11.699 --> 00:41:14.340
Do not be anxious.

00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:21.619
Fear of what might happen is often worse than the trial itself.

00:41:21.619 --> 00:41:30.940
Trust in Jehovah and be assured that he will never abandon his friends.

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:38.300
The dear brothers and sisters whom we've just listened to are doing well spiritually.

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:42.820
We thank them for participating in these interviews.

00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:48.699
We'd also like to thank all our brothers and sisters working in the medical field

00:41:48.699 --> 00:41:53.139
who have gone the extra mile during this pandemic.

00:41:53.139 --> 00:41:56.219
James 5-11 reads,

00:41:56.219 --> 00:42:00.739
We consider happy those who have endured.

00:42:00.739 --> 00:42:06.980
You have heard of the endurance of Job and have seen the outcome Jehovah gave.

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:13.019
That Jehovah is very tender in affection and merciful.

00:42:13.019 --> 00:42:20.940
The blessings we receive by enduring trials can strengthen us for the future and help us

00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:26.980
to become the kind of person that Jehovah wants us to be.

00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:34.739
The inner peace and joy we experience is a gift from Jehovah.

00:42:34.739 --> 00:42:40.340
As these brothers and sisters from around the world have reminded us,

00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:49.099
we need never doubt that our wonderful Heavenly Father will bless all those who continue loving

00:42:49.099 --> 00:42:56.480
Him.

00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:01.360
We thank all of the sisters and brothers who were interviewed for their sincere comments

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:06.559
and for allowing us to benefit and learn from their experiences.

00:43:06.559 --> 00:43:15.639
These candid interviews show that we can remain at peace even when enduring severe trials.

00:43:15.639 --> 00:43:23.210
Jehovah always supports and cares for us, his loyal servants.

00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:27.050
The time has now come for the baptism discourse.

00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:32.489
We encourage all baptism candidates to pay particular attention.

00:43:32.489 --> 00:43:36.530
How does walking and Jehovah's way bring peace?

00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:40.449
How can we stay on the road to everlasting life?

00:43:40.449 --> 00:43:45.329
Please listen carefully, as Brother William Turner, a helper to the service committee, delivers

00:43:45.329 --> 00:43:58.719
the talk, go on walking and the way of peace.

00:43:58.719 --> 00:44:04.599
We cannot express to you baptism candidates around the world how much of a privilege it

00:44:04.599 --> 00:44:08.880
is for us to share in this occasion with you.

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:13.719
You are following through on the most important decision you've ever made to make it known

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:19.599
publicly that you have dedicated your life to God.

00:44:19.599 --> 00:44:22.440
We know your situation is very.

00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:27.039
Some of you candidates were raised knowing about Jehovah, but you had to develop your

00:44:27.039 --> 00:44:30.440
own personal relationship with Him.

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:36.039
Others of you may be taking this step after learning about Jehovah more recently, but

00:44:36.039 --> 00:44:41.639
whatever your circumstances, likely it was a journey.

00:44:41.679 --> 00:44:46.559
A figurative road you had to travel to get to this point.

00:44:46.559 --> 00:44:54.000
In fact, the Bible also compares true worship to a road, a path, or a walkway that has

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.199
to be traveled.

00:44:56.199 --> 00:45:02.239
In Acts 9 verse 2, as the first century Christian congregation was being established, Jesus

00:45:02.239 --> 00:45:10.480
disciples used the term the way to designate their newly established form of worship.

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:17.679
They understood that as baptized Christians, they were walking on a new path, and every

00:45:17.679 --> 00:45:25.599
aspect of their lives was involved, and that's going to be the case for you as well.

00:45:25.599 --> 00:45:27.559
In fact, note how the Bible describes this.

00:45:27.559 --> 00:45:32.039
Turn with me, please, to the book of Ephesians.

00:45:32.039 --> 00:45:50.829
And note what is stated in Ephesians chapter 4, and we'll read verses 22 through 24.

00:45:50.829 --> 00:45:54.949
There it says, you were taught to put away the old personality that conforms to your

00:45:54.949 --> 00:46:01.469
formal course of conduct, and that is being corrupted according to its deceptive desires.

00:46:01.469 --> 00:46:07.550
And you should continue to be made new in your dominant mental attitude, and should put

00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:15.869
on the new personality that was created according to God's will in true righteousness and loyalty.

00:46:15.869 --> 00:46:21.670
So like the first century Christians, you have come to know the truth about Jehovah,

00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:27.550
and the things you've learned has led you to become baptism candidates.

00:46:27.550 --> 00:46:34.989
Like all of God's people, you've done as verse 22 states to put away the old personality.

00:46:34.989 --> 00:46:45.829
But there in verse 23, we must also continue to be made new in our dominant mental attitude.

00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:52.789
This involves our thoughts, what we allow our mind to dwell on.

00:46:52.789 --> 00:46:58.269
Now you note the footnote for that verse indicates this term could also be rendered as the

00:46:58.269 --> 00:47:07.789
force actuating our mind, or literally translate it to the spirit of your mind.

00:47:07.789 --> 00:47:14.030
In the English language, perhaps you've heard someone say that they are in good spirits,

00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:19.510
or you've heard someone described as being mean spirit it.

00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:27.949
Well that's a description of one's dominant mental attitude, one's thoughts and motivations.

00:47:27.949 --> 00:47:34.159
It's what moves us to act the way that we do.

00:47:34.159 --> 00:47:41.199
Our goal as baptized servants of Jehovah is to gain a dominant mental attitude that

00:47:41.199 --> 00:47:47.599
aligns and is in harmony with God's thoughts.

00:47:47.599 --> 00:47:50.440
Now that won't always be easy.

00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:54.440
It takes time and a lot of effort.

00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:59.639
Those who walk in the way of peace often encounter trials.

00:47:59.639 --> 00:48:06.079
And to stay on that road, we must be willing to make sacrifices.

00:48:06.079 --> 00:48:13.239
Like some of those first century Christians, we may have to endure direct persecution.

00:48:13.239 --> 00:48:21.079
But if we continue to walk in Jehovah's way, we're going to be happy and Jehovah is going

00:48:21.079 --> 00:48:22.559
to bless us.

00:48:22.559 --> 00:48:32.480
In Luke chapter 1, verse 79, he assures us that he will guide our feet in the way of peace.

00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:35.159
That's a comforting thought, isn't it?

00:48:35.159 --> 00:48:37.800
So we're excited.

00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:43.519
We're excited that you baptism candidates have undertaken this journey and know that you

00:48:43.519 --> 00:48:49.239
have some eight and a half million other witnesses on this road with you.

00:48:49.239 --> 00:48:55.599
And today it is our honor and privilege to welcome you.

00:48:55.599 --> 00:49:04.199
To welcome you to Jehovah's way of peace and the road leading off into life.

00:49:04.199 --> 00:49:08.000
As we go through our discussion today, we're going to answer three questions.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:15.840
First, why is it important that we do not give up on walking in Jehovah's way of peace?

00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:22.679
Second, how does walking in Jehovah's way bring us peace?

00:49:22.679 --> 00:49:30.519
And third, what can we do to continue walking in Jehovah's way of peace?

00:49:30.519 --> 00:49:33.760
Well, let's address our first question.

00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:39.840
Why is it important that we do not give up in walking in Jehovah's way of peace?

00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:41.679
Now, I answer that.

00:49:41.679 --> 00:49:47.780
Let's turn please to 2 Corinthians chapter 4.

00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:56.219
And we'll note 2 Corinthians chapter 4, verses 16 through 18.

00:49:56.219 --> 00:50:02.179
There it reads, therefore, we do not give up.

00:50:02.179 --> 00:50:07.539
But even if the man we are outside is wasting away, certainly the man we are inside

00:50:07.539 --> 00:50:10.659
is being renewed from day to day.

00:50:10.659 --> 00:50:16.179
For though the tribulation is momentary and light, it works out for us a glory that is

00:50:16.179 --> 00:50:21.019
of more and more surpassing greatness and is everlasting.

00:50:21.019 --> 00:50:27.539
While we keep our eyes not on the things seen, but on the things unseen.

00:50:27.539 --> 00:50:36.000
For the things seen are temporary, but the things unseen are everlasting.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.199
Do you see why we can't give up?

00:50:39.199 --> 00:50:44.800
It's because being one of Jehovah's Witnesses requires that we remain active and persevere

00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:48.039
in the way of peace.

00:50:48.039 --> 00:50:52.840
You dear candidates have not given up in your efforts to please Jehovah and to qualify

00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:55.039
to become part of His people.

00:50:55.039 --> 00:50:58.639
And why is that?

00:50:58.639 --> 00:51:01.079
It's because of your love for Him.

00:51:01.079 --> 00:51:08.559
And you know that any trials and obstacles you face now are momentary and light when

00:51:08.559 --> 00:51:13.519
compared to an eternity in God's new world.

00:51:13.519 --> 00:51:18.599
Today you will enter into a special relationship with Jehovah God.

00:51:18.599 --> 00:51:25.360
So don't let anyone or anything jeopardize that relationship.

00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:33.719
Let it be something that you cherish because that relationship is everlasting.

00:51:33.719 --> 00:51:38.079
So keep walking in Jehovah's way of peace.

00:51:38.079 --> 00:51:44.760
Notice on what it means to have Him as a friend, to have Him guiding your steps.

00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:52.639
If you don't give up, then despite any trials you face, you will continue to enjoy Jehovah's

00:51:52.639 --> 00:51:54.679
blessings.

00:51:54.679 --> 00:51:58.360
And we're confident that you can do so.

00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:04.639
But to highlight how this can be done, at this time, we're pleased to introduce Sister

00:52:04.679 --> 00:52:07.159
Indira Alfonso.

00:52:07.159 --> 00:52:13.239
Sister Alfonso was baptized in 2006, and now serves with her husband as Bethel family members

00:52:13.239 --> 00:52:15.840
in Warwick.

00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:22.199
Sister Alfonso, can you tell us a little about your journey, how you became associated with

00:52:22.199 --> 00:52:23.199
Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:52:23.199 --> 00:52:28.639
Yes, I was born in Cuba, but my mom and I moved to the United States when I was nine.

00:52:28.639 --> 00:52:31.840
Even though I was young, I felt it was important to look for God.

00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:36.480
So whenever we moved, I would visit the local churches in the area, even getting baptised

00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:37.960
in a number of them.

00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:43.679
When I was 11, my mom let me move in with my aunt, who was one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:52:43.679 --> 00:52:48.719
And from there, she asked my mom if I could study with a pioneer sister from her congregation

00:52:48.719 --> 00:52:50.039
and my mom agreed.

00:52:50.039 --> 00:52:55.199
Well, nice to see that even at a young age, you had a spiritual need.

00:52:55.199 --> 00:53:01.159
So during this time leading up to your baptism as one of Jehovah's Witnesses, did you encounter

00:53:01.159 --> 00:53:03.880
any trials that threatened to make you give up?

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:05.360
Yes, I did.

00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:06.920
I made changes very quickly.

00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:12.119
I stopped celebrating holidays, stopped praying to idols, but these changes were very

00:53:12.119 --> 00:53:16.559
strange to my mom, just difficult for her to understand.

00:53:16.559 --> 00:53:19.320
She really was afraid I was being brainwashed.

00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:24.159
So after studying for several months, she had me moved back in with her, which meant the

00:53:24.159 --> 00:53:27.840
end of my studies and no more attending meetings.

00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:32.960
It wasn't long before my association was affecting my speech and my behavior.

00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:37.239
I found myself easily influenced to even celebrate my birthday again.

00:53:37.239 --> 00:53:41.440
I could feel I was moving further away from Jehovah instead of closer to him.

00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:44.639
I'm sorry to hear that sister, Alfonso.

00:53:44.639 --> 00:53:49.880
So what helped you not to give up and to go on walking in the way of peace?

00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:54.800
What helped me was this scripture in Matthew 1037, where Jesus said, whoever has greater

00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:59.440
affection for father or mother than for me is not worthy of me.

00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:04.320
I realized that a peaceful relationship with Jehovah might mean no peace with my family.

00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:08.880
But I knew that if I were to ever gain my mom, I had to walk with Jehovah the right way

00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:10.599
and not give up.

00:54:10.599 --> 00:54:15.440
So one night I prayed to him, crying for forgiveness and asking for his help.

00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:20.360
Until my surprise a few days later, without any explanation, my mom had me moved back in

00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:21.760
with my aunt.

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:27.840
I resumed my Bible studies and after a year later at the age of 15, I got baptized.

00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:32.000
Jehovah clearly heard and answered your prayer.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:36.239
Since then, have you seen continued evidence of Jehovah's guidance?

00:54:36.239 --> 00:54:40.719
A good friend helped me to adjust the way I was communicating with my mom.

00:54:40.719 --> 00:54:45.280
So one day I called her and expressed to her, how much I truly appreciate and love her.

00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:48.320
I didn't want us to be distant anymore.

00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:55.280
I explained to her that my love for her had never changed, but my love for Jehovah had come first.

00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:58.320
So that conversation was a turning point for us.

00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:03.599
Now we have had many positive discussions and she's much more understanding of my decision.

00:55:03.599 --> 00:55:09.519
Seeing Jehovah's guidance in my life makes me determined to continue walking in his way of peace.

00:55:09.519 --> 00:55:11.679
Thank you so much, Sister Alfonso.

00:55:11.679 --> 00:55:18.039
We appreciate your faithful example and comments.

00:55:18.039 --> 00:55:21.159
Well, let's address our second point.

00:55:21.159 --> 00:55:26.199
How did walking in Jehovah's way bring us peace?

00:55:26.199 --> 00:55:32.840
As to answer this, we're going to compare the path or journey you've taken on the road to life

00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:36.199
with a literal road or walkway.

00:55:36.199 --> 00:55:41.000
And in making this comparison, we find a number of similarities.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:48.760
First, both roads have boundaries, a purpose, and a destination.

00:55:50.519 --> 00:55:52.840
Let's start with that first one, boundaries.

00:55:54.039 --> 00:56:01.559
On a literal road, we may see yield or do not interest signs, guard rails on the side of the road,

00:56:02.199 --> 00:56:05.079
or lines on the road to help us stay in our lane.

00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:07.639
Well, those are boundaries.

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:11.400
And those boundaries are there for our protection.

00:56:12.199 --> 00:56:17.639
Because if we step outside of them, we risk getting hurt or lost.

00:56:20.170 --> 00:56:25.769
It would be great if we could tell you that as you continue on the road to life after your baptism,

00:56:26.889 --> 00:56:30.730
we would love to say that the rest of your journey is smooth sailing.

00:56:30.730 --> 00:56:32.489
You'll have nothing but safe travels.

00:56:35.050 --> 00:56:41.289
But the reality is that you will face challenges and test of your faith.

00:56:43.050 --> 00:56:44.329
The devil will make sure of it.

00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:49.690
He will make sure that you are confronted with temptations.

00:56:51.050 --> 00:56:55.929
He wants to do whatever he can to damage your special relationship with Jehovah.

00:56:58.010 --> 00:57:00.090
But we're confident that you can succeed.

00:57:01.050 --> 00:57:09.210
You can be successful and avoid danger if you remain within the boundaries of Jehovah's way of peace.

00:57:11.050 --> 00:57:12.889
Now, how do you stay within those boundaries?

00:57:14.250 --> 00:57:19.929
By continuing to learn about Jehovah's laws and principles and obeying them.

00:57:21.769 --> 00:57:27.289
That obedience will not only protect you, but it will give you inner peace,

00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:31.210
peace that comes from having a clean conscience.

00:57:33.789 --> 00:57:38.829
The next similarity between a literal road and being on the road to life that we'll discuss

00:57:39.789 --> 00:57:41.630
is having a purpose.

00:57:43.309 --> 00:57:49.630
When we travel on a literal road, our plan usually is not to get on the road and just

00:57:50.190 --> 00:57:56.110
stand still, to become stationary or watch other people or vehicles go by.

00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:58.989
No, we're there for a reason.

00:57:59.949 --> 00:58:06.110
The purpose of the road is to enable movement to help us get from one place to another.

00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:14.590
Well, in a similar sense, being on Jehovah's way of peace allows you to move forward

00:58:15.469 --> 00:58:17.949
to make continual spiritual progress.

00:58:19.550 --> 00:58:23.150
And of course, there are many ways that we can make spiritual advancement.

00:58:24.110 --> 00:58:31.150
One important way that all Christians can do so is in cultivating spiritual qualities.

00:58:32.349 --> 00:58:34.190
This is so pleasing to Jehovah.

00:58:35.309 --> 00:58:39.309
Consider with me, for example, Galatians chapter 6, verse 10.

00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:49.559
Notice what's mentioned here, Galatians chapter 6, verse 10.

00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:57.800
It says, so then, as long as we have the opportunity, let us work what is good toward all.

00:58:58.679 --> 00:59:03.239
But especially toward those related to us in the faith.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:11.400
So one way to advance spiritually is to look for ways to do good things for others,

00:59:12.039 --> 00:59:15.639
both inside and outside the congregation.

00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:20.599
This pandemic has afforded us many opportunities to do this.

00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:26.360
We've been able to call and check on others and distribute food or supplies when needed.

00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:33.719
And think of what our brothers have done time and again to assist others during natural disasters.

00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:38.440
So take a minute and think about your local area.

00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:43.079
How can you work what is good toward all?

00:59:45.239 --> 00:59:49.079
Are there ones that need assistance getting food or running errands?

00:59:50.599 --> 00:59:55.719
Is there someone who could use a good word of encouragement to cheer them up?

00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:00.559
Do we know individuals who have lost loved ones in death

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:07.039
with whom we could share words of comfort or maybe simply provide a listening ear?

01:00:08.559 --> 01:00:12.159
You see, by displaying spiritual qualities,

01:00:12.159 --> 01:00:17.280
qualities such as kindness, compassion, hospitality, generosity,

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:22.559
see, you're going to feel deeply rewarded for doing these things.

01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:30.960
And you're pleasing Jehovah because you will show that your purpose for being on the road to life

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:36.480
is not just to save yourself, but to help others.

01:00:39.199 --> 01:00:44.079
And there was a third similarity between being on a literal road and being on the road to life.

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:50.960
In both cases, we have a destination that we want to reach.

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:56.480
Traveling on a literal path will eventually take you to your destination.

01:00:56.480 --> 01:01:02.559
And as a witness of Jehovah, our journey, our walk on this figurative road,

01:01:02.559 --> 01:01:11.679
will lead us to our destination, the goal of enjoying a peaceful friendship with God forever.

01:01:11.679 --> 01:01:20.039
Now, although we long for that time in God's new world, even now we can experience the blessings

01:01:20.599 --> 01:01:25.239
and inner peace that come from a life of service to Jehovah.

01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:30.699
We now have the privilege to speak with Sister Gloria Hurd.

01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:38.059
Sister Hurd has been baptized for over 70 years and has enjoyed a rich spiritual life

01:01:38.059 --> 01:01:43.179
and special full-time service with her husband, brother Samuel Hurd, of the governing body.

01:01:45.179 --> 01:01:51.739
Sister Hurd, you've had many rich spiritual blessings and we know that you've encountered

01:01:51.739 --> 01:01:57.500
challenges along the way. But as you've carried out these assignments through the years,

01:01:58.219 --> 01:02:04.059
walking in Jehovah's way of peace, how have you managed to enjoy greater inner peace?

01:02:05.019 --> 01:02:08.059
I learned, Brother Turner, that if Jehovah gives you an assignment,

01:02:08.619 --> 01:02:14.219
he will give you what you need to fulfill it. We learned and really benefited from the

01:02:14.219 --> 01:02:18.860
traveling overseas and their wives. It was such a privilege to serve along with these faithful

01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:23.820
brothers and sisters and several of them had served me and my family when I was very young.

01:02:24.539 --> 01:02:30.699
So to see their faithfulness, to see their happiness and to see that they really had inner peace,

01:02:31.659 --> 01:02:36.860
really benefited me. I learned from that and I wanted to follow their example.

01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:41.260
That help from others can be so valuable. How else have you managed?

01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:48.460
I've enjoyed inner peace too from praying to Jehovah a lot. Many times we had very little

01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:54.380
money or no money, but we never missed a meal and we never missed any theocratic event.

01:02:55.260 --> 01:03:02.219
We learned that having no money is not an obstacle to Jehovah. He heard our prayers,

01:03:02.219 --> 01:03:07.500
he answered them and it was if the blessing sometime just fell out of heaven.

01:03:08.139 --> 01:03:11.179
Prayer can be so powerful. Thank you for sharing that.

01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:17.340
But now, how has walking in Jehovah's way of peace helped you to have peace with others?

01:03:18.059 --> 01:03:23.340
I worked and lived with many sisters and they all had different personalities.

01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:29.980
So I learned that I had to apply Romans 12, 18 where it says, as far as it depends upon me,

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:39.579
be peaceable with all men and women. So I learned that I have to adjust my personality sometimes to

01:03:39.659 --> 01:03:49.019
keep peace. This happened very often, but one time we moved in with a sister on Tuesday morning

01:03:49.739 --> 01:03:57.739
and something I said upset her very much. She got very angry. Well, I decided not to pursue the

01:03:57.739 --> 01:04:04.940
issue because I had lived with her for a week and I just decided to let her see by my conduct

01:04:05.019 --> 01:04:11.179
that I could never have met what she thought. So as the week went by, the days went by, the tension

01:04:11.179 --> 01:04:18.539
lesson and by Monday, when we left, we were the best of friends and she gave me a big hug

01:04:18.539 --> 01:04:22.460
and nothing more was said about the subject. Well, it sounds like you handled that beautifully

01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:29.099
sisterhood. Your spiritual qualities were evident. Well, finally, how has walking in Jehovah's

01:04:29.099 --> 01:04:35.900
way of peace helped you have peace with God? Well, when you see Jehovah acting your behalf over

01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:42.139
and over and over again, it makes you feel that you have his approval. Now that Sam and I are in

01:04:42.139 --> 01:04:47.659
our senior years, we feel he has given us the desire of our heart by allowing us to serve

01:04:47.659 --> 01:04:53.900
at Bethel, which had been our goal for many years. And I know that as long as I stay faithful to

01:04:53.900 --> 01:05:00.860
Jehovah, he will continue to grant me inner peace. And we have that confidence as well.

01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:07.179
Thank you so much, sisterhood. We deeply appreciate your comments and your encouraging expressions.

01:05:10.599 --> 01:05:17.880
Well, let's now address our final point. What can we do to continue walking in Jehovah's

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:24.760
way of peace? Well, let's go back to our illustration of the road. On a literal road,

01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:30.760
travelers may need to make adjustments in response to changing road conditions or bad weather.

01:05:32.199 --> 01:05:39.159
Similarly, as you go on walking in the way of peace, you will need to readjust your actions

01:05:39.159 --> 01:05:46.360
and thinking from time to time. Recently, a circuit overseer shared an interesting point regarding

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:52.360
our thoughts and attitudes on matters. He said that they could either serve as a prison

01:05:52.760 --> 01:06:01.639
or a passport. A prison in that our thoughts and actions can confine or restrict us

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:13.280
or a passport in that they can take us where we need to be. Right now, we need to be

01:06:14.079 --> 01:06:22.239
and stay on this road to life. So we want to make sure that any needed adjustments are made in

01:06:22.239 --> 01:06:30.000
our thoughts and our actions so that we're not confined or restricted in making spiritual progress.

01:06:32.159 --> 01:06:39.039
Well, what might be some areas that we'll need to make adjustments? Notice, please, Paul's words

01:06:39.039 --> 01:06:48.909
in 2nd Corinthians chapter 13. And we'll read 2nd Corinthians chapter 13 verse 11.

01:06:56.300 --> 01:07:03.420
Paul says, finally, brothers, continue to rejoice, to be readjusted, to be comforted,

01:07:04.219 --> 01:07:11.980
to think in agreement, to live peaceably, and the God of love and of peace will be with you.

01:07:14.239 --> 01:07:19.119
Did you notice three areas in this verse where Paul states we can make adjustments?

01:07:20.079 --> 01:07:30.239
First, he says, continue to rejoice. We can lose our peace and joy if we become overwhelmed by

01:07:30.239 --> 01:07:38.559
the anxieties of life. So in order to rejoice, can you make it a goal to focus on things that

01:07:38.559 --> 01:07:46.159
bring joy rather than sadness? So if you're not feeling well or coping with chronic pain,

01:07:47.119 --> 01:07:56.320
you can focus on God's promise when no one will say, I am sick. If you're facing beliefs or

01:07:56.320 --> 01:08:02.960
or opposition for your beliefs, focus on the fact that we're part of a brotherhood, a brotherhood

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:09.199
that supports and prays for us, and arrangements are in place to keep us spiritually strong.

01:08:11.530 --> 01:08:17.930
If you're discouraged by world events, you can rejoice in the fact that you have a hope for

01:08:18.010 --> 01:08:25.369
the future. And we know how this all ends. We know that better times are ahead.

01:08:27.130 --> 01:08:35.130
The point is, don't let negative thoughts restrict or limit your progress. Instead,

01:08:36.010 --> 01:08:41.369
make the needed adjustments so that you can move forward and continue to rejoice.

01:08:43.689 --> 01:08:47.050
Not another area for readjustment, Paul mentions in verse 11.

01:08:48.090 --> 01:08:56.140
There he says, continue to think in agreement. There were members of the congregation back in

01:08:56.140 --> 01:09:03.979
the first century that were promoting apostate ideas. Others were introducing controversial ideas

01:09:03.979 --> 01:09:11.739
that were not directly unscriptural, but that were divisive. This resulted in bickering and

01:09:11.739 --> 01:09:16.939
arguing, arguments over words, really creating a spiritually unhealthy atmosphere.

01:09:18.859 --> 01:09:22.699
Well, what's going to help us to continue to think in agreement?

01:09:24.619 --> 01:09:31.739
Remember Paul's words at 2nd Timothy 2, 23, to reject foolish and ignorant debates

01:09:32.779 --> 01:09:40.300
knowing that they produce fights. Of course, we react strongly when facing issues that

01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:47.100
clearly violate Jehovah's moral laws. But if no scriptural principle is being violated,

01:09:48.539 --> 01:09:52.140
we're wise to abstain from promoting our personal opinions.

01:09:53.500 --> 01:10:01.180
We want to do all we can to avoid starting or being drawn into disagreements that can disrupt

01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:10.060
the peace of the congregation. Now back in verse 11, a third area where we can make adjustments

01:10:10.779 --> 01:10:19.039
is continue to live peaceably. Did you notice from the interview with our sisters

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:26.000
what they both did when challenged, would face with the challenge that threatened their peace?

01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:33.920
They took the matter to Jehovah in prayer. They reflected on scriptures found in God's word.

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:39.680
And then they looked to see how they could apply those verses in their particular situation.

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:46.560
It helped them to not only have inner peace, but peace with others as well.

01:10:48.159 --> 01:10:55.039
So let your spiritual qualities shine through. Continue to work on keeping peace,

01:10:55.039 --> 01:10:58.560
showing those qualities of being loving and generous toward all.

01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:05.279
But especially with our close family members, whether they are witnesses or not.

01:11:08.079 --> 01:11:13.760
Well, we want to conclude by reminding you baptism candidates that today marks a significant

01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:22.239
milestone in your journey, in your relationship with Jehovah. So take the time to appreciate

01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:31.920
what this day means for you. We're so proud of all of you. You will never regret the decision

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:40.560
you have made to dedicate your life to Jehovah. But keep in mind that after today and beyond,

01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:49.600
the journey is not yet over. Really it's just the beginning. So we encourage you to do all you can

01:11:50.319 --> 01:11:58.640
to stay on the road to life. Keep in mind the points we consider today. First, do not give up on

01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:05.920
walking in Jehovah's way of peace. Your life depends on it. Allow Jehovah to guide your steps.

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:14.880
Second, stay within the boundaries on the road to life. Remember, you're walking with a purpose.

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:22.159
And that will lead you to your destination. Peaceful friendship with Jehovah forever.

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:31.520
And finally, keep making any needed adjustments in your thoughts, your attitude and actions so that

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:38.399
you can maintain peace with Jehovah and peace with others. If you continue to do these things,

01:12:39.039 --> 01:12:45.279
not only will you have peace, but as the last part of 2 Corinthians 13 11 says,

01:12:46.239 --> 01:12:54.640
the God of love and of peace will be with you. May you always remember that promise,

01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:59.920
which Jehovah makes to those who go on walking in the way of peace.

01:13:02.239 --> 01:13:09.960
Thank you, brother Turner. Similar to last year, the arrangements for baptism will vary in each

01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:16.840
location. Each local congregation's elders have made suitable provisions in accord with local

01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:25.579
circumstances for candidates to be baptized after the conclusion of this session. We thank

01:13:25.579 --> 01:13:30.380
Jehovah for the timely spiritual food we enjoy during this session of the convention.

01:13:31.579 --> 01:13:35.899
Our next session will show us how to avoid common pitfalls to pursuing peace.

01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:40.699
It will highlight specific activities that peacemakers excel at.

01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:52.239
We will also enjoy part one of the feature Bible drama. But now, let's sing together the closing

01:13:52.239 --> 01:14:01.119
song for this session. Song number 54, this is the way. After the song, you may have your own

01:14:01.119 --> 01:14:10.560
concluding prayer. That's song number 54.
