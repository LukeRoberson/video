00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:07.879
I am delighted to address Jehovah's people and their friends worldwide today.

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:15.240
After sundown, some 20 million of us will have gathered in various congregations, groups,

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.239
and even as individuals to commemorate the death of Jesus.

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:28.000
Before we begin our discussion, we will have the text for today read by Brother Don Gordon,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.920
a helper to the publishing committee.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.399
Today is Tuesday, April 4th.

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.479
Keep doing this in remembrance of me.

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:42.399
Luke 22, verse 19.

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:47.479
Why would over 20 million people gather together this evening?

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:53.759
One reason is our scripture text for today, Luke 22, 19.

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:59.159
Jesus was in the process of inaugurating the memorial of his death.

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:05.799
He had just broken the unleavened bread and passed it to each one present.

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:13.280
The unleavened bread pictured Jesus' perfect, sinless body that he would surrender in death

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.680
for the everlasting benefit to all exercising faith in him.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.159
It is at this point that Jesus said the words of Luke 22, 19.

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:34.400
Keep doing this in remembrance of me, meaning keep using the wine and bread as the way to

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.719
remember my death, and all that it will accomplish.

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:40.760
Why would he say that?

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.040
Keep doing this.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.879
He meant exactly what he said.

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:47.359
Keep doing this.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.760
Yes, keep doing it on and into the future.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.959
How often did he intend that we keep doing it?

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:00.760
Some religions partake of the bread and wine weekly.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.640
They call it communion.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.639
Other religions let the individual congregations determine how often they would perform this activity.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:17.240
Still others instruct that it should be done four times a year.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.080
Why do Jehovah's Witnesses remember Jesus' death in this special way, just once each

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.759
year on the anniversary of Jesus' death?

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:33.719
Well there is some logic to celebrating an anniversary annually on the precise date

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:38.759
of the original event, much like a wedding anniversary.

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:45.240
Why would you celebrate a wedding anniversary on any other day of the year, or multiple

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.560
times a year?

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:54.080
Certainly you would not celebrate your wedding anniversary every week or every day.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:04.199
Interestingly, the English word anniversary is defined as the annual recurrence of a date

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:10.080
marking an event or occurrence of notable importance.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.909
Jesus' death is certainly of notable importance.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:22.550
However, not only is it logical to do so once a year, there is a biblical indication that

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:32.150
this is what Jesus was requesting in effect saying, keep doing this once a year on the anniversary

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.349
of my death in remembrance of me.

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:43.949
What is the biblical indication that it should be memorialized just once a year?

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:47.509
Let's look at the context of our text for today.

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:53.479
In Luke chapter 22, please locate that text.

00:03:53.479 --> 00:04:02.199
Our day's text is verse 19, but what was the initial purpose of Jesus and His apostles

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:06.840
gathering together for a meal on that date?

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:14.159
The date was nice and 14th, according to the Jewish or lunar calendar of that time.

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:17.399
Please look at Luke 22, 7 and 8.

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:25.879
It says, the day of the unleavened bread now arrived on which the Passover sacrifice

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:27.720
must be offered.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:36.360
So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, go and get the Passover ready for us to eat.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.720
According to Jewish law at the time, Jesus had faithfully observed the Passover once

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.720
each year.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.720
Now, read verses 14 through 17.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:55.439
So when the hour came, he reclined at the table along with the apostles, and he said to

00:04:55.439 --> 00:05:04.160
them, I have greatly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:12.040
For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:19.519
Excepting a cup, he gave thanks and said, take this and pass it from one to the other

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:22.199
among yourselves.

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:29.240
Just prior to instituting the memorial, Jesus celebrated the Jewish Passover as we just

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.839
read in verse 14 through 17.

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:41.500
By the time of the first century, it was the custom to pass four cups of wine to those

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.500
seated for the Passover meal.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:52.740
The cup mentioned in verse 17 was likely the third cup of the Passover celebration.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:06:01.899
Evidently, Jesus was saving the fourth cup for instituting the memorial of his dad.

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:10.500
So the question is, how often was the Passover to be celebrated?

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:17.199
In Exodus chapter 12, when Jehovah was preparing the Israelites to depart Egypt, he instituted

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:23.819
the Passover to remember this event of notable importance for the nation.

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:33.579
At Exodus chapter 12, verse 14, Jehovah instructed Moses, this day will serve as a memorial

00:06:33.579 --> 00:06:41.839
for you, and you must celebrate it as a festival to Jehovah throughout your generations,

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:47.459
as a lasting statute you should celebrate it.

00:06:47.459 --> 00:06:56.819
He repeated in verse 17, and you must keep this day throughout your generations as a lasting

00:06:56.819 --> 00:06:57.819
statute.

00:06:57.819 --> 00:07:06.379
So it is that Jews observed the Passover once a year as a memorial on the annual anniversary

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:09.339
of their Exodus from Egypt.

00:07:09.339 --> 00:07:15.540
So after celebrating the last of valid Jewish Passover, when Jesus instituted the memorial

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:22.860
of his death, and he said, keep doing this, his apostles would have known the intent.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:28.920
Instead of observing the Passover once a year on that date, they would now remember the

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:33.779
death of Jesus once a year on that same date.

00:07:33.779 --> 00:07:40.379
That seems pretty logical, straightforward, and has a scriptural precedent.

00:07:40.379 --> 00:07:46.540
But many phenomenal Christian religions seem to think memorializing the event more often

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:50.500
during the year must be even better.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:58.500
One part, this is because of a misunderstanding of the intent of 1 Corinthians 11, 25.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:03.740
In most English translations of the Bible, it has rendered something like this.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:10.019
Keep doing this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.

00:08:10.019 --> 00:08:17.420
Some feel that the word often indicates that Christ's death should be commemorated frequently.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:23.379
In the sense of as many times as possible, the New World translation also rendered the

00:08:23.379 --> 00:08:30.019
verse similarly, prior to the Revivized Edition being released, the wording is an accurate

00:08:30.019 --> 00:08:32.139
way of rendering the verse.

00:08:32.139 --> 00:08:38.580
However, its intent is easily misinterpreted by many.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:46.539
For example, just commemorating the Lord's evening meal once a year is often when you consider

00:08:46.539 --> 00:08:52.419
that it is approaching 2,000 years since Jesus instituted it.

00:08:52.419 --> 00:08:55.299
That in itself is often.

00:08:55.299 --> 00:09:03.100
But more precisely, in the context of 1 Corinthians 11 verses 25 and 26, Paul was discussing

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:10.429
not how often, but how the memorial should be observed.

00:09:10.429 --> 00:09:18.110
In the original language, she did not use the Greek word, which means often or frequently.

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:25.350
Rather, he used a different Greek word, which means as often as, or it could be expressed

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:30.669
whenever or every time that you do.

00:09:30.669 --> 00:09:38.990
Paul was saying, every time that you do this, you keep proclaiming the death of the Lord.

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:43.629
To make that even clearer to the reader, the Revivized New World translation now renders

00:09:43.629 --> 00:09:47.990
the text at 1 Corinthians 11 25 this way.

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:55.950
Keep doing this whenever you drank it in remembrance of me.

00:09:55.950 --> 00:10:02.990
And as discussed already, Jesus intended that it be a once a year replacement for the

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:11.840
annual Passover observance on the anniversary of Jesus' death.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:19.840
To be clear, following the process Jesus instituted with the bread and wine, just once

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:31.480
a year does not mean we only think about Jesus' death on one day of the year, no.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:38.360
Those of you who are dedicated and baptized witnesses of Jehovah know that we think of

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:44.200
Jesus' sacrificial death every day of the year.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:51.080
It is mentioned in our regular congregation meetings, in our family worship, and every

00:10:51.080 --> 00:11:00.240
prayer, we say, acknowledges Jesus presenting the value of his sacrificial death in our

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.360
behalf.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:09.320
At the end of every prayer, we acknowledge to God that we are praying in Jesus' name.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.799
Amen.

00:11:11.799 --> 00:11:18.120
Being imperfect, we do not have direct access to Jehovah.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:27.679
Instead he readily accepts our prayer if we say it in the name of his son, Jesus Christ.

00:11:27.679 --> 00:11:34.759
Most of you viewing this program are well aware of the fact that the memorial is primarily

00:11:34.759 --> 00:11:38.879
for those chosen by God for heavenly life.

00:11:38.879 --> 00:11:45.000
It signifies there being party to the New Covenant, to share in the kingdom with Christ.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:53.240
However, all who gather together tonight will benefit greatly from being in attendance.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:12:00.919
All of us are imperfect, and we benefit from Jesus' ransom sacrifice, which is the basis

00:12:00.919 --> 00:12:04.000
for forgiveness of sins.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And all of us have the prospect of everlasting life in the future, whether that is in heaven

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:20.720
for the few anointed ones or in a paradise earth for the millions of others serving Jehovah.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:27.159
So only the few anointed ones will actually partake of the bread and wine tonight.

00:12:27.159 --> 00:12:33.480
Due to the high percentage of those in attendance with an earthly hope, very few by comparison

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.120
will partake of the emblems.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:41.159
In most congregations, there will likely not be any partakers.

00:12:41.159 --> 00:12:44.519
In others, maybe one or two.

00:12:44.519 --> 00:12:50.279
If that is the case, why do we pass the emblems to each one in attendance?

00:12:50.279 --> 00:12:56.919
Why not just invite any of the anointed to the stage to partake of the bread and wine?

00:12:56.919 --> 00:13:03.639
It would save a lot of time instead of passing the emblems to all in the audience.

00:13:03.639 --> 00:13:11.360
The foremost reason the emblems are passed before all is because that follows the pattern

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.200
set by Jesus.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:21.240
However, if an anointed one makes clear his heavenly hope by partaking, what about those

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:26.919
of you who pass the emblems by without partaking?

00:13:26.919 --> 00:13:35.039
You too are going on public notice that your hope is to live forever in a marvelous paradise

00:13:35.039 --> 00:13:38.080
here on earth.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.039
And think about it.

00:13:40.039 --> 00:13:44.440
For humans, that is the best life ever.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:49.559
It is what Jehovah originally intended for mankind when he created the first couple

00:13:49.559 --> 00:13:53.070
in the Garden of Eden.

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:58.470
What could be better for a human than that?

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:04.629
All of us eagerly look forward to the time soon to come when the evil influence of Satan

00:14:04.629 --> 00:14:07.309
is taken away from the earth.

00:14:07.309 --> 00:14:16.029
He and all of his demon followers will be hurled into an abyss of inactivity for a thousand

00:14:16.029 --> 00:14:18.429
years.

00:14:18.429 --> 00:14:24.029
The resurrected anointed ones will share with Christ and bringing that about.

00:14:24.029 --> 00:14:29.990
And those alive on earth, during the thousand year reign of Jesus, will share in bringing

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:39.440
the earth back to the condition Jehovah originally intended.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:44.279
Extending our thoughts even further into the future, after the thousand year reign of

00:14:44.279 --> 00:14:52.960
Christ, mankind will have reached perfection, similar to Adam and Eve after their creation,

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.039
and before their plunge into sin.

00:14:56.039 --> 00:15:03.960
Each Corinthians 1524 says, next the end, when he hands over the kingdom to his God and

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.440
father.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:13.279
By then the Messianic kingdom will have fulfilled its role to have an earth filled with perfect

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:14.960
people.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:24.279
Then after a final test by Satan, any dissenters will be eliminated, and Satan and his demons

00:15:24.279 --> 00:15:27.759
will be forever destroyed.

00:15:27.759 --> 00:15:32.519
At that time Jehovah's original purpose for the earth will be fully realized.

00:15:32.519 --> 00:15:37.840
The entire planet will be fully beautiful people.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:46.600
All worshippers of the universal sovereign are precious father Jehovah God.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:52.440
Brother Gordon, will you please read the watchtower comments for today's text?

00:15:52.519 --> 00:15:59.440
Jesus spoke to his eleven faithful apostles about two covenants or agreements, the new covenant

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.720
and the kingdom covenant.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:06.320
These covenants opened up the way for those apostles and a limited number of others to

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:10.159
become kings and priests in heaven.

00:16:10.159 --> 00:16:14.759
Only the anointed remnant who are in these two covenants may partake of the bread and

00:16:14.759 --> 00:16:18.159
the wine at the memorial.

00:16:18.159 --> 00:16:25.039
Jehovah has given them a remarkable hope to enjoy immortal and incorruptible life in heaven

00:16:25.039 --> 00:16:32.840
to serve alongside the glorified Jesus Christ and the rest of the 144,000 and above all

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:37.440
to be in the very presence of Jehovah God.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:43.919
The anointed recognize that they must remain faithful until their death.

00:16:43.919 --> 00:16:46.039
Thank you, Don.

00:16:46.039 --> 00:16:50.320
For the past few days our Bible reading has covered the Bible accounts leading up to

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.399
Jesus' death.

00:16:52.399 --> 00:16:56.600
We invite you to follow along with the reading for today.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:02.519
The specific verses will appear on screen in your language, along with the reading

00:17:02.519 --> 00:17:10.210
enjoy the new artwork that has been prepared this year.

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:15.970
On the first day of the unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying,

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:20.009
Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?

00:17:20.009 --> 00:17:21.529
He said,

00:17:21.529 --> 00:17:25.369
Go into the city to sow and sow and say to him,

00:17:25.369 --> 00:17:26.930
The teacher says,

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:29.250
My appointed time is near.

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:34.210
I will celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your home.

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:49.019
So the disciples did as Jesus instructed them and prepared for the Passover.

00:17:49.019 --> 00:17:55.339
The day of the unleavened bread now arrived, on which the Passover sacrifice must be offered.

00:17:55.339 --> 00:17:59.500
So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying,

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:03.180
Go and get the Passover ready for us to eat.

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:04.940
They said to him,

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:07.460
Where do you want us to get it ready?

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:08.900
He said to them,

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.819
Look, when you enter into the city,

00:18:11.819 --> 00:18:15.859
a man carrying an earthenware water jar will meet you.

00:18:15.859 --> 00:18:18.500
Follow him into the house that he enters,

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.140
and say to the landlord of the house,

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:23.339
The teacher says to you,

00:18:23.339 --> 00:18:28.660
Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:33.299
And that man will show you a large furnished upper room.

00:18:33.299 --> 00:18:35.539
Get it ready there.

00:18:35.539 --> 00:18:39.099
So they left and found it just as he had told them,

00:18:39.099 --> 00:18:52.000
and they prepared for the Passover.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.200
When evening came, he was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.200
While they were eating, he said,

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.000
Truly, I say to you,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.119
One of you will betray me.

00:19:05.119 --> 00:19:08.200
Being very much grieved at this,

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.799
Each and every one began to say to him,

00:19:11.799 --> 00:19:15.839
Lord, it is not I, is it?

00:19:15.839 --> 00:19:18.359
In reply, he said,

00:19:18.359 --> 00:19:24.279
The one who dips his hand with me into the bowl is the one who will betray me.

00:19:24.279 --> 00:19:27.680
True, the son of man is going away,

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.000
just as it is written about him.

00:19:30.039 --> 00:19:35.039
But woe to that man through whom the son of man is betrayed.

00:19:35.039 --> 00:19:40.279
It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.

00:19:40.279 --> 00:19:45.279
Judas, who was about to betray him, replied,

00:19:45.279 --> 00:19:49.160
It is not I, is it Rabbi?

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.200
Jesus said to him,

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:57.140
You yourself said it.

00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:00.900
As they continued eating, Jesus took a loaf,

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:03.579
and after saying a blessing, he broke it,

00:20:03.579 --> 00:20:06.940
and giving it to the disciples, he said,

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.380
Take, eat.

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:12.299
This means my body.

00:20:12.299 --> 00:20:15.140
And taking a cup, he offered thanks,

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:17.500
and gave it to them, saying,

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:20.019
Drink out of it, all of you.

00:20:20.019 --> 00:20:22.700
For this means my blood of the covenant,

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:28.180
which is to be poured out in behalf of many for forgiveness of sins.

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:29.660
But I say to you,

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:33.859
I will by no means drink again any of this product of the vine

00:20:33.859 --> 00:20:42.440
until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:45.000
Finally, after singing praises,

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.539
they went out to the Mount of Olives.

00:20:50.539 --> 00:20:52.980
Then Jesus said to them,

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:57.539
All of you will be stumbled in connection with me on this night.

00:20:57.539 --> 00:20:59.019
For it is written,

00:20:59.019 --> 00:21:00.940
I will strike the shepherd,

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:04.579
and the sheep of the flock will be scattered about.

00:21:04.579 --> 00:21:06.980
But after I have been raised up,

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:10.259
I will go ahead of you into Galilee.

00:21:10.259 --> 00:21:13.779
But Peter, in response, said to him,

00:21:13.779 --> 00:21:17.180
Although all the others are stumbled in connection with you,

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:19.859
I will never be stumbled.

00:21:19.859 --> 00:21:22.019
Jesus said to him,

00:21:22.019 --> 00:21:23.779
Truly, I say to you,

00:21:23.779 --> 00:21:27.900
On this night, before a rooster crows,

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:32.099
You will disown me three times.

00:21:32.099 --> 00:21:34.220
Peter said to him,

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:37.299
Even if I should have to die with you,

00:21:37.299 --> 00:21:40.779
I will by no means disown you.

00:21:40.779 --> 00:21:46.839
All the other disciples also said the same thing.

00:21:46.839 --> 00:21:53.039
Then Jesus came with them to the spot called Gethsemane.

00:21:53.039 --> 00:21:55.400
And he said to the disciples,

00:21:55.400 --> 00:22:01.269
Sit down here while I go over there and pray,

00:22:01.269 --> 00:22:04.750
And taking along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee,

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:09.470
He began to feel grieved and to be greatly troubled.

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:11.789
Then He said to them,

00:22:11.789 --> 00:22:14.269
I am deeply grieved,

00:22:14.269 --> 00:22:16.109
Even to death,

00:22:16.109 --> 00:22:20.390
Stay here and keep on the watch with me.

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:22.230
And going a little way forward,

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:25.750
He fell face down, praying.

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:29.230
My Father, if it is possible,

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:32.829
Let this cup pass away from me,

00:22:32.829 --> 00:22:35.630
Yet not as I will,

00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:38.470
But as you will.

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:42.710
He returned to the disciples and found them sleeping.

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:44.869
And He said to Peter,

00:22:44.869 --> 00:22:50.509
Could you not so much as keep on the watch for one hour with me?

00:22:50.509 --> 00:22:54.390
Keep on the watch and pray continually

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:58.150
So that you may not enter into temptation.

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:00.829
The Spirit, of course, is eager,

00:23:00.829 --> 00:23:04.799
But the flesh is weak.

00:23:04.799 --> 00:23:07.200
Again, a second time,

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.400
He went off and prayed,

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:14.200
My Father, if it is not possible for this to pass away,

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.160
Unless I drink it,

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:19.160
Let your will take place.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:23.240
And He came again and found them sleeping

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:27.279
For their eyes were heavy.

00:23:27.279 --> 00:23:28.720
So leaving them,

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:32.160
He again went off and prayed for a third time,

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:37.279
Saying once more the same thing.

00:23:37.279 --> 00:23:41.240
Then He returned to the disciples and said to them,

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:43.279
At such a time as this,

00:23:43.279 --> 00:23:46.920
You are sleeping and resting.

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.640
Look, the hour has drawn near

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:52.039
For the Son of Man to be betrayed

00:23:52.039 --> 00:23:54.359
Into the hands of sinners.

00:23:54.359 --> 00:23:57.039
Get up, let us go.

00:23:57.039 --> 00:24:02.619
Look, my betrayer has drawn near.

00:24:02.619 --> 00:24:04.500
While he was still speaking,

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:08.059
Look, Judas, one of the twelve came

00:24:08.059 --> 00:24:11.779
And with him a large crowd with swords and clubs

00:24:11.779 --> 00:24:16.140
Sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people.

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:20.299
Now his betrayer had given them a sign, saying,

00:24:20.299 --> 00:24:24.259
Whoever it is I kiss, he is the one.

00:24:24.259 --> 00:24:26.660
Take him into custody.

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:30.700
And going straight up to Jesus, he said,

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:36.579
Greetings, Rabbi, and gave him a tender kiss.

00:24:36.579 --> 00:24:39.099
But Jesus said to him,

00:24:39.099 --> 00:24:44.380
Fellow, for what purpose are you present?

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:47.500
Then they came forward and seized Jesus

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:49.819
And took him into custody.

00:24:49.819 --> 00:24:52.259
But look, one of those with Jesus

00:24:52.259 --> 00:24:54.779
Reached out his hand and drew his sword

00:24:54.779 --> 00:24:57.299
And struck the slave of the high priest,

00:24:57.299 --> 00:25:02.299
Taking off his ear, then Jesus said to him,

00:25:02.299 --> 00:25:05.299
Return your sword to its place

00:25:05.299 --> 00:25:08.019
For all those who take up the sword

00:25:08.019 --> 00:25:10.420
Will perish by the sword.

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:13.740
Or do you think that I cannot appeal to my father

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:18.619
To supply me at this moment more than twelve legions of angels?

00:25:18.619 --> 00:25:22.259
In that case, how would the scriptures be fulfilled

00:25:22.259 --> 00:25:25.779
That say it must take place this way?

00:25:25.779 --> 00:25:29.380
In that hour, Jesus said to the crowds,

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:32.619
Did you come out to arrest me with swords and clubs

00:25:32.619 --> 00:25:34.660
As against a robber?

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:38.220
Day after day, I used to sit in the temple teaching

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:41.579
And yet you did not take me into custody.

00:25:41.579 --> 00:25:44.140
But all of this has taken place

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:47.980
For the writings of the prophets to be fulfilled.

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:56.000
Then all the disciples abandoned him and fled.

00:25:56.079 --> 00:25:58.920
Those were significant verses

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:03.319
Leading up to the two greatest acts of love of all time.

00:26:03.319 --> 00:26:08.000
Jehovah and Jesus cooperated together to undo

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.319
The works of the devil that were initiated back in the garden of Eden

00:26:13.319 --> 00:26:16.480
With Adam and Eve.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:20.079
Whether ever you're anointed or the other sheep

00:26:20.079 --> 00:26:24.400
We all have the marvelous hope of everlasting life

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:32.190
Based on the ransom sacrifice of the perfect man, Jesus.

00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:37.710
We hope all of you enjoy your evening commemorating Jesus' death

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:40.190
In behalf of all of us.
