00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:10.730
We're school bus drivers back home in Tucson, Arizona, we're driving the brothers and sisters from Brooklyn to Tuxedo.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:21.260
We're so excited just to be able to be here and never thought that driving school bus would give you assignment here at Bathville.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:27.859
Tuxedo was primarily a support site for the new World Headquarters in Warwick.

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:35.859
Not only will it house some of the volunteer workers but it'll also be used to support them anywhere from meals to materials to equipment.

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:51.850
A number of our volunteers will get up very early in the morning to meet the bus before 530.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:59.850
All unpaid, many either taking leave of absences from work, some outright retiring that have been waiting for this project to start.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:10.329
It's always been a dream to be at Bathville so I'm very happy that we got accepted.

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:13.329
We've come here to build the new World Headquarters.

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:20.329
Initially, Bathville called and they said we'd like you to come out for one to six weeks.

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:25.329
And I thought to myself, well, if I take off six weeks, I'd have to quit my job.

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:36.049
So we thought about it and we prayed and then the next day we called Bathville back and said we'll come out for six weeks.

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.049
We've both been assigned to the plumbing department.

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.049
And I'm working in pipe insulation.

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:50.459
It draws us closer together and it gives us many memories that we'll be able to cherish together for a long time.

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:54.459
I am currently working on the electrical crew here at Tuxedo.

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:56.459
Every day is exciting.

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:05.459
With all the people here and with all the different temporary workers, everyone working together, you can see that this can only happen in Jova's organization.

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:10.460
I love being able to be a part of something so wonderful and such a privilege.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:19.419
My assignment is walls and ceilings and my husband and I, we have been here nine weeks.

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:25.419
We have had a lot of privileges, for instance, with international worker, with Katrina.

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:33.819
There's a lot of sisters, so that's really exciting opportunity for them.

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.819
They're very hard workers, they're willing to do anything they're asked to do.

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.819
If they're not skilled when they came, they're skilled when they leak.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.500
Since coming here, it's truly just been a remarkable privilege.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:59.500
I thought that I would be giving a lot of myself, but in actuality I've been gaining so much more.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.219
The construction project at Warwick is in its early stages.

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:09.219
There's been some work being done to clear portions of the site.

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:22.530
The logs are being milled and many of them will come back and find a home on this project.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.530
The future for this project is really bright.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.530
This is going to be an exciting thing to be a part of.

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.530
We're going to be able to do this in an expedited fashion and we're going to have a lot of fun at the same time.
