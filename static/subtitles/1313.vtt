WEBVTT

00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:14.070
The long-awaited day had finally arrived.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:23.739
Many hours of happy preparation were coming to completion.

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:33.100
It was time for the dedication of the newly expanded Liberia branch.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.100
Emotions ran high as delegates from around the world

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.100
and long-term friends maintained after many years of absence.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:01:01.250
Like coming home, like home.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.250
There's no place like home.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.250
And this is it.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.250
Really.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.250
That's how we honestly feel.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.250
Well, it's been very wonderful.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.250
It's been like coming back home.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.250
We're visiting from Sierra Leone, free town.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.250
From Lothar.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.250
From Lothar.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.250
From London, back home.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.250
No, I'm visiting from Kudiwa.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.250
Tanzania.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.250
San Jose, California.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.250
Ghana.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.250
Bermuda.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.250
Mozambique.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.250
From Hawaii.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.250
We are so happy to be back here.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:49.739
Guests were invited to tour the new facilities.

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:54.739
Members of the better family were on hand to accring them with each department.

00:01:54.739 --> 00:02:26.509
To learn little about the local people,

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:31.300
a culture center was set up.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.300
It was popular for cloth,

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.300
handicrafts,

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.300
and typical foods were on display.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.400
Freshly picked coconuts

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.400
and sugarcane provided a refreshing treat.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:57.020
Also, a traditionally constructed mod house was built.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.169
A highlight of the tour.

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:05.169
It gave visitors a feel for our country life.

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:13.139
The main event was the dedication program.

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:14.139
The publishers.

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:17.139
Most of whom have been serving Jehovah

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:20.139
faithfully for over 30 years.

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.139
Eagaly took their seats.

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:28.139
How did the chairman, Winston Besman, feel as he began the program?

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:31.139
I just can't stop smiling.

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:37.139
Because we have all waited for this day.

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:42.139
We have prepared long and hard for this day.

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:47.139
We have done a countdown to this day.

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:50.139
In Kisi, we say Lacha Huno.

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:53.139
In Pelle, we say Kasele.

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:57.139
In Loma, we say Womama Vasu.

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.139
In Mano, we say Kasene.

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:04.139
In Arabic, Ahala wasahala.

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:06.139
In Liberia English, we say,

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:08.139
You're welcome, O.

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:10.139
Yes, brothers and sisters.

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:13.139
You are all welcome.

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:18.139
So the dedication program of the Liberia branch expansion.

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:22.139
Thomas Nyen revealed the history of the working Liberia

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.139
by interviewing the panel of missionaries

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.139
who served here beginning in the 1960s.

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:34.139
First, Royal Wingo commented on a neutrality issue faced

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.139
during the Convention in Bangal in 1963.

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:44.139
The matter, a challenge of whether you're going to give Jehovah

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:51.139
his things or whether you were going to give Caesar Jehovah's things.

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:53.139
Who's going to get what?

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:56.139
That's the challenge.

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:02.139
So that question was answered by some faithful witnesses

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:05.139
during that Bangal episode.

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:12.139
My Bennett, now serving at the U.S. branch, spoke about the importance of training on this.

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:15.139
When I first started serving in the traveling work,

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:22.139
I said to myself that the local brothers would really have a larger impact on the congregations.

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:25.139
So then what I did is as I would visit congregations,

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:31.139
I would select young men like Jethro Barclay, Momo Kamara, people like that.

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:34.139
And I would tell them that you should be doing this work, not me.

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:36.139
I said, you have bigger impact.

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:40.139
So then I would take them with me every time I would visit a congregation.

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:43.139
And I would say, would you like to look at the circuit overseer's form?

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:44.139
And so they'd do that.

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:49.139
And then I'd say, would you like to look at the S2 form for recommendations for appointments?

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:50.139
They did that.

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:53.139
I said, would you like to see the program for the circuit assembling?

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:54.139
How it's organized.

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:57.139
So over the years before the war, that's what I did,

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:01.139
not knowing that it would really prove to be providential.

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:06.139
Then Paul Kudos, a former branch committee member in Liberia,

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:11.139
reflected on a comment made during a Zoom visit in 1986.

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:19.139
He said, brothers, the governing body is wanting to appeal to you brothers,

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:24.139
please, is good for us to have help from outside.

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:30.139
But over the years, we have seen the need for more of the local brothers here in Liberia

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:36.139
to reach out so that they can also be used by the organization.

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:40.139
And it was fine that he said that in 1986,

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:43.139
because I believe that in the audience,

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:47.139
where many young brothers and sisters who heard that,

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:50.139
and they took it very seriously.

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:54.139
Finally, but a year spoke with Rafael Harrison.

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:57.139
Most of what we've said here that have been happening

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:02.139
at least in the last 40 years, who was here to see it all?

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:04.139
And it's still here.

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:08.740
Let us finally talk to Brother Harrison.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.740
What were some of the challenges you faced?

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:18.740
Well, I faced my first challenge a few days after my arrival in Liberia

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.740
as a single missionary in 1973.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:30.740
Brother Stephen Reigns, who was here, handed me a territory card for Gardner's Hill.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:35.740
And he said, well, this would be your personal territory.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.740
This was a real challenge for me.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.740
Why? Well, as a regular pioneer and a special pioneer,

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.740
I always worked with partners.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:50.740
So here, I was in a strange country, a new territory.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.740
And I was on my own.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:56.740
Natania Thompson and Philip O'Dell then directed a discussion

00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:00.740
with several local and international workers.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:04.740
Unless Jehovah himself builds the house,

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:09.740
it is to know a veil that its builder have worked hard on it,

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:15.740
looking around and seeing this beautiful branch facilities.

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:19.740
No doubt, Jehovah Hand was involved.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:25.740
Jim, what were some of the challenges in dealing with tearing down a one building

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.740
and trying to put another one in its place?

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:32.740
Initially, some of the big challenges were with scheduling.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.740
We were supposed to be finishing in a few weeks,

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.740
just renovate the building and we're done.

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:39.740
And that was in the end of 2011.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:43.740
Have you received any favorable comments from our neighbors

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.740
that you can remember or relate to us?

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:49.740
And the mayor of Painsville actually came out and saw the work we were doing.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.740
And he was so impressed.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.740
And he said, people should know that Jehovah's Witnesses

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.740
are doing so much to help even in the community.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:59.740
And it really made us feel good because, I mean,

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:02.740
that's what all this is really for is to give a good witness,

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:04.740
to spread the good news in the territory.

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:09.740
So we're really happy that even secular work can bring honor to Jehovah in that way.

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:13.740
The audience then enjoyed encouraging reports

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:18.740
from representatives of Serolion, Ghana,

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:22.740
and Kenya.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.740
Finally, John Williams mentioned an interesting fact

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.740
from the US branch.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:34.740
Additionally, it is encouraging to see that we now have 11 missionaries

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:38.740
in the United States ready to continue working the fields

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:42.740
that are according to John 434, white

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.740
for harvesting.

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:47.740
Warm greetings were then read

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:52.690
from various branches around the world.

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:58.690
But a best man then introduced the long-anticipated dedication discourse.

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:01.690
Our speaker is Brother Guy Pierce,

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:03.690
a member of the governing body.

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:06.690
The dedication discourse is entitled,

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:10.690
be satisfied with Jehovah's goodness.

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:12.690
Brother Pierce, you have our attention.

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:16.690
First of all, we would like to bring greetings to you, brothers and sisters,

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:20.690
from the governing body and the Bethel family in the United States branch.

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:29.389
We deeply appreciate the hard work you're doing in your territories

00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:31.389
to advance the interest of God's kingdom,

00:10:31.389 --> 00:10:36.389
and it's obvious because the need we have for this branch facility here.

00:10:36.389 --> 00:10:40.389
A personal note, my wife Penny and I were delighted to get the invitation

00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:42.389
to come to this part of the world.

00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:46.389
It's our first time here in Liberia.

00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:49.389
I don't know what took us so long.

00:10:49.389 --> 00:10:52.389
We enjoyed some of the beautiful countryside and, of course,

00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:54.389
the most beauty of all we see in front of us here

00:10:54.389 --> 00:10:57.389
with our brothers and sisters.

00:10:57.389 --> 00:11:02.389
So we would just want to regret and connect with our visit here.

00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:06.389
We're not here nearly as long as we'd like to be.

00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:09.389
We'd like to be here long enough to get to know each of you.

00:11:09.389 --> 00:11:15.389
Well, but a piece then commented on the purpose of the expansion.

00:11:15.389 --> 00:11:17.389
I don't know how it described this when I came here,

00:11:17.389 --> 00:11:22.389
but it's elegant with its buildings and gardens and it's practical.

00:11:22.389 --> 00:11:26.389
But really, the great thing is not the buildings.

00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:29.389
It's the, what the brothers and sisters are doing here.

00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:34.389
Please turn to your Bibles to Haggai, chapter 2, verse 7.

00:11:34.389 --> 00:11:37.389
It says, and I will rock all the nations

00:11:37.389 --> 00:11:41.389
and the desirable things of all the nations must come in.

00:11:41.389 --> 00:11:45.389
And I will fill this house with glory, Jehovah of Army sits in.

00:11:45.389 --> 00:11:49.389
So it's filling his house with glory of these desirable things

00:11:49.389 --> 00:11:52.389
that are brought in to his organization.

00:11:52.389 --> 00:11:57.389
And who are these desirable things that you, your brothers and sisters,

00:11:57.389 --> 00:11:59.389
you are desirable.

00:11:59.389 --> 00:12:04.389
Next, he focused on our motive for seven Jehovah.

00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:06.389
Well, certainly, we're not serving Jehovah God just because

00:12:06.389 --> 00:12:08.389
we're going to have everlasting life.

00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:12.389
Our love for him goes much deeper than that.

00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:14.389
Because we love him, we serve him.

00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:16.389
The blessings will come. The benefits will be there.

00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:20.389
But that's not the reason we serve.

00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:21.389
We serve because we love him.

00:12:21.389 --> 00:12:22.389
And that's true of the Bethelites.

00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:23.389
You're here at Bethel.

00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:25.389
And it's not because of the benefits.

00:12:25.389 --> 00:12:29.389
Not because of what he's doing for you, but it's your personal attachment.

00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:32.389
Your love, your service, Jehovah God.

00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:35.389
And so we have this marvelous arrangement now for this dedication.

00:12:35.389 --> 00:12:39.389
And we're so pleased to have a part in doing this with your brothers and sisters.

00:12:39.389 --> 00:12:41.389
That's the light for us to have a share.

00:12:41.389 --> 00:12:44.389
I mean, the earth is filled with excitement.

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:48.389
We see persons who haven't met, seen one another for years, maybe decades.

00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:50.389
And it's shown and it's wonderful.

00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:52.389
You're ruined and you have here.

00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:54.389
And we'd let it be a part of that.

00:12:54.389 --> 00:12:58.389
And now it's time for us to give a dedication prayer.

00:12:58.389 --> 00:13:03.389
But before we do this, we'd like to get your approval.

00:13:03.389 --> 00:13:05.389
So I like to buy a show of hands.

00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:06.389
Is this what you choose to do?

00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:11.389
Do you want to dedicate these buildings, this branch of unity to Jehovah God?

00:13:11.389 --> 00:13:13.389
Let's see your show of hands.

00:13:13.389 --> 00:13:16.389
Oh, I guess that's quite obvious, isn't it?

00:13:16.389 --> 00:13:18.389
That's what you want.

00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:20.389
After a dedication prayer by Thomas Yen,

00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:24.389
but a piece shared his close-in tots.

00:13:24.389 --> 00:13:27.389
So we have a wonderful thing, allowing us to be his witnesses

00:13:27.389 --> 00:13:30.389
and looking forward now to the everlasting future,

00:13:31.389 --> 00:13:33.389
of course, under his direction.

00:13:33.389 --> 00:13:35.389
And the direction of his organization,

00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:38.389
the earthly part of his organization,

00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:40.389
seeing the work made it accomplished

00:13:40.389 --> 00:13:41.389
and far reaches of the earth.

00:13:41.389 --> 00:13:43.389
So keep up the good work.

00:13:43.389 --> 00:13:45.389
It's been a real pleasure to be with all of you.

00:13:45.389 --> 00:13:47.389
I will look forward to seeing you tomorrow as well.

00:13:49.389 --> 00:13:57.100
We're happy hearts.

00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:00.100
All seven red tete in attendance

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.100
reflected on the programme

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:06.100
every joy is to be part of this specially.

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.100
We love this place, we love the people here.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.100
It's a privilege to be here.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.100
I arrived here this morning,

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:16.100
just really pleased like a paradise.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:19.100
I waited for this day, for 40 years, for the whole year.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:21.100
And it finally came today.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.100
Very exciting.

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:24.100
I mean, you see that it's one family.

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.100
But the young ones that we knew who've grown up

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.100
and they're now special pioneers,

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:32.100
death alliance is very, very encouraging.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:35.100
Yeah, it's been outstanding to see the love in action.

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.100
And just the way we've been received,

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:40.100
you can just feel the love is so genuine.

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:43.100
They have welcomed us like family.

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:45.100
It's overwhelming.

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:49.100
I feel happy today to be a mum and sister.

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:54.100
This is an indication that the work is going to take off.

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:57.100
It is not by a mum's power,

00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:00.100
but the whole world's full on this dark kindness

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:03.100
has kept me in the service of the natural citizens

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.100
wonderful day, blessing day.

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:08.100
I'm very proud to see how things have progressed here,

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.100
how the brothers have progressed,

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.100
how the organisation has grown,

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:14.100
and we're very pleased with that.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.100
We've got people that will have not seen for so long,

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:20.100
even the mission I've had left here for more than 25 years

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:23.100
who are privileged to meet them here today

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:26.100
and hug them is just a very joyful occasion to me.

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.100
I'm very happy.

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.100
It's wonderful that the hard-working,

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.100
better lights in the local field

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.100
can have a place like this now

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.100
that they can use to advance the work.

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:39.100
And they say that Liberia gets in your skin

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.100
and I absolutely see why.

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:43.100
Well, we'll tend to go on.

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.100
We're very happy to be here for any occasion.

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:48.100
Branch office being dedicated to you.

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:51.100
Okay, I'll need to order to go on, thank you.

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:53.100
As I still remember about me,

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.100
it brought me to see it.

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.100
I'm happy to be here.

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:59.100
And if you see all of these old friends coming by,

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:03.100
it brings down tears.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:07.100
Today I feel like I'm in paradise already.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:12.100
It's like half time again on how nice I will be to see everybody

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:14.100
and all time was in particular.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.100
So I'm so happy today.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.100
I'm very, very, very happy.
