WEBVTT

00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:10.369
Dear brothers, sisters, faithful children, and interested ones, it is a great pleasure

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:13.650
to be with you for this update.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.929
We have many good things to share with you, including an update on our response to several

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:23.089
major natural disasters.

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:30.010
And at the end of this update, it will be a privilege to share with you our reassuring

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.250
your texts for 2022.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:44.689
To begin though, I have some important facts about COVID-19 vaccines to share with you,

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:51.689
because we love you all very much, and because this is a life and death matter, we have decided

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:56.649
to share what we know about this with you.

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:06.450
It's June 1st, in the United States, 1,407 publishers have been hospitalized because

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.170
of COVID-19 or its symptoms.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.129
Of these, less than 1% were fully vaccinated.

00:01:17.129 --> 00:01:30.409
Sadly, in that same time period in the United States, 486 of our brothers died from COVID-19.

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:36.250
Of these, less than 1% were fully vaccinated.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.969
And our understanding is that the vaccinated individuals who died had serious underlying

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:46.170
health problems.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.370
These statistics are very sobering.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:59.890
We can also tell you that of more than 22,000 betholites and 44,000 special full-time servants

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:08.370
in the field who have been vaccinated, we have received only four reports of severe

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:14.129
adverse reactions that may be linked to the vaccination.

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:21.009
But thankfully, it's been reported that all of these are stable and their condition

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:23.889
is under control.

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:30.449
We share this information with you so you can carefully consider it when making your personal

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:34.889
decision regarding vaccination.

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:42.889
We feel it would not be loving to withhold these facts from you.

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:53.810
This proverb's 327 says, do not withhold good from those to whom you should give it.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:00.770
We know it can be difficult to make a wise decision when there are various opinions

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:10.930
and conflicting reports that the world provides, perhaps making it hard to know what to believe.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:19.289
But the aforementioned statistics have been collected by our brothers so we can trust

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:21.530
these figures.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.530
We hope they will be useful to you.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:32.689
We appreciate that this is not a scientific study, but we can tell you what our brothers

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:34.650
have observed.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:43.189
And because we have this information, we want you to know what we know.

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:49.629
Of course, we also need to consider the direction provided by the superior authorities.

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:58.550
In some lands, governments are enacting laws that all their citizens must be vaccinated.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.430
In other lands, it is strongly encouraged.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.110
How do we react to such direction?

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:13.349
The remaining God's love book made a fine point when it said this.

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:22.230
Today, Jehovah allows governments to have some authority, and we should respect them.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:28.230
They organize countries and communities so that they function smoothly and provide people

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.629
with necessary services.

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:38.029
These obey the instruction found at Romans 13-1-7.

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:44.670
We respect the superior authorities and obey the laws of the country or community where

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.430
we live.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:52.750
These laws may affect our family, business, or possessions.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.589
Also the study note on Romans 13-5 says this.

00:04:58.589 --> 00:05:07.629
A Christian submits to human governments when a command does not contradict God's laws.

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:14.110
So this is another serious factor that we each should carefully and prayerfully consider

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.670
in making our decision.

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:24.870
As a result of having over 99% of the United States Bethel family fully vaccinated, we have

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:33.149
been able to open up more activities within Bethel in accord with New York State regulations.

00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:39.790
This allowed the Bethel family to have the Gilead meal together and then the Gilead graduation

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:44.339
on September 11.

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:49.019
No gas from outside Bethel were present for either occasion.

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:59.300
Also, fully vaccinated Bethel family members in the United States have received permission

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:08.180
to take personal time to visit family and friends taking proper COVID-19 precautions

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.779
while away from Bethel.

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:20.819
In fact, as of September 24, over 3,975 fully vaccinated Bethel family members in the

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:27.620
United States have traveled during August and September.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:33.939
Upon their return to Bethel, they're put on a form of adjusted quarantine and a few days

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:38.540
later are tested for COVID-19.

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:45.819
Of these 3,975, we have had just four COVID cases.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:55.220
Two, got mild cases of COVID at their destination and it resolved before they returned to Bethel.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:05.459
The other two, who tested positive on return, also had minor symptoms that quickly resolved.

00:07:05.459 --> 00:07:10.769
All four have fully recovered.

00:07:10.769 --> 00:07:16.129
We're happy to report that this arrangement will soon go into effect for our Bethelites

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:19.889
at most branches around the world.

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:28.370
We're able to do this at branches where more than 90% of the Bethel family are fully vaccinated.

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:42.089
Those branches are getting back into a more normal routine.

00:07:42.089 --> 00:07:49.449
But now we have a brief update about how our brothers are doing after recent natural disasters

00:07:49.449 --> 00:07:53.569
in Haiti and in the United States.

00:07:53.569 --> 00:08:05.370
As reported in JW News, a magnitude 7.2 earthquake struck Haiti on Saturday, August 14.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:11.810
Sadly, three witnesses died as a result.

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:17.490
Our hearts go out to the families of these wines.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:24.089
The branch office recently provided this report on the relief efforts.

00:08:24.089 --> 00:08:31.730
The earthquake destroyed approximately 130 of the homes where our brothers were living

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:35.169
and damaged another 250.

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:43.809
On Monday, August 16, two days after the earthquake, tarps arrived for many of our brothers

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:47.970
just ahead of the rains of tropical storm grace.

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:57.090
Since then, we have distributed over three tons of supplies and 28 tons of food to our brothers.

00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:04.169
Tents, tarps, blankets, mattresses, water filtration kits, solar-powered flashlights

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:07.490
and solar chargers have been distributed.

00:09:07.529 --> 00:09:14.690
Additionally, volunteers are working hard to evaluate and inspect the homes of our brothers.

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:23.009
Although in difficult economic situations themselves, the local brothers in the capital of Port-apprents

00:09:23.009 --> 00:09:30.940
have generously donated tons of food.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:37.980
The United States experienced Hurricane Ida, which made landfall as a category 4 hurricane

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.179
on August 29.

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:44.980
The storm passed from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast.

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:54.700
The branch office reports that as of September 20, 2,788 of our brothers who evacuated

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:58.980
are not yet able to return to their homes.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:05.779
It is estimated to be several weeks before the power is restored in some areas.

00:10:05.779 --> 00:10:13.980
The storm damaged over 1,800 homes of our brothers and destroyed 28 more.

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:22.100
In addition, 58 kingdom halls and four assembly halls were damaged.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:27.460
Under the direction of the circuit overseers, local brothers and sisters quickly began to

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:33.379
stabilize hundreds of homes damaged by the storm.

00:10:33.379 --> 00:10:41.340
Two disaster relief committees are providing tarps, materials, food, water and generators

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:44.460
when local supplies are exhausted.

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:50.340
All of this activity is being carried out with proper safety standards and appropriate

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:54.460
COVID-19 precautions.

00:10:54.460 --> 00:11:03.059
We are grateful for the hard work of all who are helping with the relief efforts, including

00:11:03.059 --> 00:11:06.980
all of you who have contributed financially.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:14.230
Thank you for your generosity and kindness.

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:20.190
But now let's discuss our 2022 year text.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:28.509
When the pandemic began, we had no idea it would still be of concern one and a half years

00:11:28.509 --> 00:11:30.750
later.

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:34.629
It has impacted the economy of many lands.

00:11:34.629 --> 00:11:40.549
As a result, people, including many of our brothers and sisters, do not have much

00:11:40.549 --> 00:11:42.549
material.

00:11:42.549 --> 00:11:50.269
Some only have meager provisions, including a scarcity of food.

00:11:50.269 --> 00:11:54.830
It reminds us of fateful David of old.

00:11:54.830 --> 00:12:00.830
He was not being hounded by a deadly virus, but he was running and trying to hide from

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:08.710
Jealous King Saul, who was intent on killing David and those with him.

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:10.429
Prophesians were low.

00:12:10.429 --> 00:12:17.590
There was very little to eat, and David lost his home for a time, hiding out in caves

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:20.149
in the wilderness.

00:12:20.149 --> 00:12:28.070
While things were very bleak materially, it was at this time that David composed the beautiful

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:32.470
song recorded in Psalm 34.

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:36.509
Was he distracted from his worship of Jehovah?

00:12:36.509 --> 00:12:40.870
Was he gloomy and dejected during that difficult time?

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:51.070
Well, let's read a few verses from Psalm 34 and see how David was regarding his attitude.

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:59.669
From Psalm 34, verse 1, I will praise Jehovah at all times.

00:12:59.669 --> 00:13:04.990
His praise will be on my lips constantly.

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:12.750
And then in verse 3, he encouraged others to join him in praising Jehovah.

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:19.990
Verse 3, David said, magnified Jehovah along with me.

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:24.350
Let us exalt his name together.

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:33.029
What a beautiful attitude, despite the hardships he was facing at the time.

00:13:33.029 --> 00:13:38.990
So many of you dear brothers and sisters are struggling economically during this time of

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:42.669
pandemic and uncertainty.

00:13:42.669 --> 00:13:50.149
But the governing body wanted me to share with you, especially verse 10 of Psalm 34.

00:13:50.149 --> 00:13:57.710
Verse 10, even strong young lions have been reduced to hunger.

00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:05.029
But those seeking Jehovah will lack nothing good.

00:14:05.029 --> 00:14:10.470
The last part of that verse is the year text for 2022.

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:18.070
Those seeking Jehovah will lack nothing good, Psalm 34, verse 10.

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:25.950
Now obviously, as we've been discussing, David was not referring to an abundance of physical

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:27.750
sustenance.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:33.190
We remember the 23rd Psalm where David said something similar.

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:40.669
He said, Jehovah is my shepherd, I will lack nothing.

00:14:40.669 --> 00:14:46.389
The rest of that Psalm refers to spiritual blessings enjoyed, even though he admitted

00:14:46.389 --> 00:14:53.029
he walked, quote, in the valley of deep shadow.

00:14:53.029 --> 00:14:58.590
Throughout that Psalm, he extolls the spiritual blessings he enjoyed.

00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:06.629
He concluded by saying at Psalm 236, and I will dwell in the house of Jehovah for all

00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:09.230
my days.

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:17.149
And that is the prayer of all of Jehovah's fateful servants in these critical times.

00:15:17.149 --> 00:15:24.629
Dear friends, the coronavirus is not the worst trial to strike out at all mankind.

00:15:24.629 --> 00:15:26.830
And it won't be the last.

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:31.309
We can expect things to deteriorate even further.

00:15:31.309 --> 00:15:38.429
As these last days march on to their end.

00:15:38.429 --> 00:15:43.990
Economic hardship and other trials will come and go.

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:54.110
But like the Psalmist, we can agree that the 2022 year text will prove true, spiritually

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:55.429
speaking.

00:15:55.429 --> 00:16:04.950
The Psalm 3410 states, those seeking Jehovah will lack nothing good.

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:15.950
Dear brothers and sisters, we truly and deeply love you all very much.

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:23.830
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.
