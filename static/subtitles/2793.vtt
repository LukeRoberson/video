00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.309
Wow, I forgot how beautiful it is around here.

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:09.310
It just seems smaller now.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.310
You were only seven last time we were here, Meg.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.310
Yeah, I wish I could go back.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:26.949
I didn't come here to say I told you so.

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.949
And I'm not here to judge you.

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:32.950
So you came here to change my mind?

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.950
Sweetie, you're not seven anymore.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.950
You have to make your own choices.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.950
That's right. I'm choosing to be happy.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.950
I made plenty of mistakes.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.950
But I'm ready to move on.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.950
When you think this divorce is going to help you move on?

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.950
Yes.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.950
I didn't set the best example spiritually.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.950
I didn't take the lead like I should have.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.950
And I'm really sorry for that.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.950
Dad, you don't have to...

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:01.950
No, Megan.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.950
I've been doing a lot of praying about your mother and me.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.950
About you.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.950
I've decided I need to do better spiritually.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.950
So I'm starting now.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.950
I don't think I understand what do you mean.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.950
Before you go through with this divorce.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.950
Let me ask you one question.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.390
What is it that brought you to this moment?

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.390
I don't know. I guess Zach wasn't the one.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.390
No, sweetheart.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.390
You made a choice.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.390
You chose Zach.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.390
And did you include Jehovah in that choice?

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.340
Probably not.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.340
And now you're unhappy.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.340
Dad, I know all this.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.340
Meg, look, here's the point.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.340
You're about to make another huge decision.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.340
And who's not being included in that?

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.340
Sweetheart, happiness is always going to elude you.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.340
If you keep leading Jehovah out of the picture.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.340
You just don't get it.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.340
You'd be surprised, Meg.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.219
Yeah, I doubt it.

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:24.580
What do you see when you look at your mother and me?

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.580
You guys love each other.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.759
We do.

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:35.030
We do.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.030
But our marriage isn't perfect.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.030
No marriage is.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.759
It's made up of two imperfect people.

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:46.009
A sweetie.

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:48.009
A love centered on Jehovah.

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:50.009
It takes those two imperfect halves.

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:52.009
And makes them one flesh.

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:57.289
But what do I have to make the sacrifice?

00:02:57.289 --> 00:03:05.610
Because you made the vow.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.610
The key loves me anymore.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.610
Maybe he thinks the same about you.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.240
Reach out to him.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.580
Trust him, Jehovah.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.580
So you did come here to change my mind.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.580
No, sweetheart.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.270
I'm here because I love you.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:38.330
Love is patient and kind.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.740
Does not look for its own interest.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.740
Does not become provoked.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.740
It does not keep account of the injury.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.740
It bears all things.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.740
Believes all things.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.740
Hopes all things.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.740
Indoors all things.
