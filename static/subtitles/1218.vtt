00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.859
I became one of Jehovah's Witnesses in 1975 in Zaire.

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:14.599
Zaire was under dictatorship at that time.

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:16.960
There was only one political party,

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.760
and everyone was supposed to join it.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.280
Therefore, a position at work also required

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.079
a position in the political party.

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.039
I refused to have anything to do

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.420
with these political activities.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.159
One day they asked me to be present for the flag salute.

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:37.039
I had to go and explain to all the workers

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:40.600
that had assembled why I didn't want to be there.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.000
So as I said off understandably, I prayed a lot.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.359
Until then, I would just stay out of sight.

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:51.119
But on that day, everyone was very angry.

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:53.000
So I had to be present.

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:58.829
On Saturday, a man from the party came.

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.590
He came to the office and started to yell,

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.920
who doesn't want to participate in political activities?

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.040
He carried on talking and called everyone to come outside.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.480
So everyone went outside.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.640
I stayed alone in the office.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.200
On the way home, I thought maybe they were going to arrest me,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.959
but they did not.

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:28.819
We went home, myself included.

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:31.980
Afterwards, besides having to face peer pressure

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.060
nearly every day, I was demoted.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.340
One year the children didn't attend school

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.579
because we didn't have enough money.

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.540
Even for our day-to-day needs, it became difficult.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.939
I didn't neglect spiritual things.

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.540
I always kept busy attending the meetings,

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.980
participating at the meetings in the ministry

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.980
with my personal study,

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.900
and even more so with my prayer to Jehovah.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.739
Jehovah has blessed me because I'm still in the truth.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.259
All that time he has blessed me to be neutral

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.060
is the best way to show that we support Jehovah's Kingdom

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.099
apart from the preaching work, obviously.

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.580
Even when the government goes against our activity,

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.819
we shouldn't take this as something bad or negative.

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.500
It can serve a purpose.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.500
It can render a witness.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.500
It is a witness in support of God's Kingdom,

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.139
the name of Jehovah and his authority.

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:40.139
Understanding it in that way, we will rely on Jehovah.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.379
Jehovah never allows something without reason.
