WEBVTT

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:05.980
The governing body has asked me to speak to you for a few minutes on the theme,

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.980
Jehovah cares for his sheep.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.980
Hebrews chapter 2 verse 1 says,

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.980
It is necessary for us to pay more than the usual attention to the things we have heard,

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.980
so that we never drift away.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:32.979
Sadly, some of Jehovah's people have drifted away to the extent that they no longer attend meetings

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:34.979
or go out in the ministry.

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:39.979
For one reason or another, they've become inactive.

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:44.289
Is that your situation?

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:50.289
If so, never forget the words of 1 Peter chapter 5 verse 7.

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.289
There, the Bible tells us to throw all our anxiety on Jehovah,

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.289
and then it adds the phrase,

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:02.289
because he cares for you.

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:05.290
Because he cares for you.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.290
What do those words imply?

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.290
It's true that Peter was speaking to a group of Christians,

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.290
so he used the plural word for you in that verse.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.290
But does that mean that Jehovah only cares for his people as a group?

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.290
Or does he care for you and me as individuals?

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.290
To be honest,

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:36.290
our imperfect mind may fight the idea that Jehovah cares for us personally.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.290
From everything we've seen in this world,

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.290
the more power someone has, the less he seems to care about individuals.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.290
For example, a politician might campaign for your vote,

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.290
but he doesn't even know your name.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.290
It might be almost impossible for you to approach him.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.290
How different from our God, Jehovah.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:08.289
Jehovah cares for each individual who has entered into a relationship with him.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.289
How do we know that?

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.289
Open your Bible to John 6 and verse 44.

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:23.289
Now here, Jesus made a profound statement about those who choose to serve Jehovah.

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:28.289
At John 6, verse 44, Jesus said,

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:36.289
no man can come to me unless the father who sent me draws him.

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:40.289
Now, think about what those words imply.

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:45.289
By means of the preaching work, which reaches us individually,

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:51.289
and by means of his Holy Spirit, which helps us grasp the truth,

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:58.289
Jehovah personally draws us toward his son and toward his organization.

00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:05.289
To draw someone, Jehovah must see something of value in that person,

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:09.289
and that means he must care about that person.

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:13.289
But what if for some reason you've drifted away from the congregation?

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:17.289
Does that mean Jehovah has forgotten you?

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:22.289
Not at all. Consider the love Jehovah showed for his people,

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:27.289
the Israelites, even when they were separated from their homeland,

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:30.289
and taken captive by the Assyrians.

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:32.289
Did Jehovah forget about them?

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:34.289
Did he reject them?

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:38.289
Would he ever welcome them back home?

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:42.289
Once the Israelites were moved to change their course,

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:44.289
Jehovah took notice.

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:50.289
At Jeremiah chapter 31 and verse 18, he says,

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:54.289
I have surely heard Ephraim's moaning.

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:57.289
But what was Ephraim moaning?

00:03:57.289 --> 00:04:01.289
What were the people crying out to Jehovah?

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:10.289
Bring me back, and I will readily turn back for you are Jehovah my God.

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:14.289
Or as another translation renders those words,

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:16.290
you are our God.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.290
Please let us come home.

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.290
When the Israelites called out to Jehovah for help,

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:30.290
he heard, he cared, and he responded.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.290
Can Jehovah do the same for you?

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:38.290
Yes, in fact, he is already searching for you.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:45.290
Open your Bible to Ezekiel chapter 34 and verse 16.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:50.290
Now, as we read this verse, notice four things

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.290
that Jehovah does for his precious sheep who have been lost.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:00.290
At Ezekiel 34 and verse 16, Jehovah says,

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.290
the lost one I will search for,

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.290
the stray I will bring back,

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.290
the injured I will bandage,

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.290
and the weak I will strengthen.

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.290
Did you notice four things that Jehovah does

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.290
for those who have been lost?

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.290
First, he searches for them.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.290
Once they're found, he brings them back.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.290
Then, he bandages their wounds,

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:38.290
and finally, he strengthens them.

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.290
If you are inactive,

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:47.290
do Jehovah's words at Ezekiel 34, 16 touch your heart?

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.290
Perhaps you feel similar to the writer of Psalm 119,

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.290
who begged Jehovah in verse 176.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:00.290
I have strayed like a lost sheep.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.290
Search for your servant,

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:06.290
for I have not forgotten your commandments.

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.290
The fact that you are watching this broadcast

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.290
is evidence that you haven't forgotten Jehovah,

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.290
and he hasn't forgotten you.

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:19.290
In fact, it could be

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:22.290
that by means of this program,

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.290
Jehovah is searching for you.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.290
The question isn't,

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.290
why are you inactive,

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:32.290
or how long have you been inactive?

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.290
The real question is,

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.290
are you ready to come home?

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:41.290
Admittedly, it will take effort to return.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.290
But what will happen when you put forth that effort?

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.290
James chapter 4 verse 8 says,

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.290
that when you draw close to Jehovah,

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.290
he draws close to you.

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:59.290
That means he still cares for you as an individual.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:03.290
But it's urgent that you act without delay.

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.290
Why?

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:12.290
Open your Bible to Luke chapter 21 and verses 34 to 36.

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:16.290
The clear warning that Jesus gave

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:21.290
should be food for thought for every one of Jehovah's precious sheep.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:28.290
At Luke chapter 21 verses 34 and 35, Jesus said,

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.290
pay attention to yourselves,

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:33.290
that your hearts never become weighed down

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:35.290
with overeating,

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.290
and heavy drinking,

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.290
and anxieties of life,

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:41.290
and suddenly,

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:45.290
that day be instantly upon you as a snare.

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:48.290
For it will come upon all those dwelling

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:51.290
on the face of the whole earth.

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:57.290
Now, notice the call to action in verse 36.

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:59.290
Keep awake then,

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:02.290
all the time making supplication

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:06.290
that you may succeed in escaping all these things

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:08.290
that must occur

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:12.290
and in standing before the Son of Man.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:16.290
The message in these verses is clear.

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:20.290
The nearness of the end makes it urgent

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:23.290
that we pay attention to ourselves.

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:27.290
The August 15, 2015 watchtower

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:32.289
offered some thought-provoking comments on this matter.

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:34.289
It stated,

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:37.289
how bad do you expect conditions to become

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:40.289
before the Great Tribulation?

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:41.289
For example,

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:45.289
do you expect that there will be a war in every country?

00:08:45.289 --> 00:08:48.289
No food on anyone's table?

00:08:48.289 --> 00:08:51.289
An illness in every household?

00:08:51.289 --> 00:08:53.289
Under those conditions,

00:08:53.289 --> 00:08:56.289
even skeptics would feel compelled to admit

00:08:56.289 --> 00:09:00.289
the Bible prophecy was undergoing fulfillment.

00:09:00.289 --> 00:09:01.289
However,

00:09:01.289 --> 00:09:06.289
Jesus said that most people would take no note of His presence,

00:09:06.289 --> 00:09:10.289
carrying on with life's normal activities

00:09:10.289 --> 00:09:13.289
until it is too late.

00:09:13.289 --> 00:09:15.289
Thus, the Scriptures indicate

00:09:15.289 --> 00:09:18.289
that world conditions during the last days

00:09:18.289 --> 00:09:21.289
would not become so extreme

00:09:21.289 --> 00:09:24.289
that people would be forced to believe

00:09:24.289 --> 00:09:26.289
that the end is near.

00:09:26.289 --> 00:09:27.289
Well then,

00:09:27.289 --> 00:09:29.289
the article said this,

00:09:29.289 --> 00:09:35.480
we should not assume

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.480
that much time is needed

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.480
for the state of this world to develop to the point

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.480
where the ten horns

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:47.480
and the wild beast of Revelation 17 verse 16

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.480
turn on Babylon the Great,

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.480
the world empire of false religion.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.480
Let us bear in mind

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.480
that God will put it into their hearts

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.480
to make that move,

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.480
and this could happen swiftly,

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.480
and at any time,

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.480
the end of this entire system of things

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:11.730
is not far off.

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:13.730
Brothers and sisters,

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:17.730
do you sense the urgency in those words?

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:20.730
It may be that until now,

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:22.730
you thought that some world event

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:24.730
would make it clear

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:27.730
that you need to return to Jehovah,

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:29.730
but the Bible tells us

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:31.730
that the Great Tribulation

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:34.730
will break out with such suddenness

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:37.730
that it will catch people unaware,

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:40.730
leaving no time to make changes.

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:42.730
Really then,

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:44.730
if you have been inactive

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:49.730
and waiting for the right time to return,

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:51.730
this is it,

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:53.730
and you can be sure

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:56.730
that Jehovah will welcome you back home.

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:59.730
He views each sheep

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:02.730
as a valuable part of his congregation.

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:04.730
In fact,

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:07.730
notice what Jehovah says about his people

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:11.730
at Malachi chapter 3 and verse 17.

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:15.730
Now, as we read the words in this verse,

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:17.730
think about the value

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:19.730
that Jehovah places

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:22.730
on each individual in his organization,

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:26.730
including those who may have drifted.

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:29.730
At Malachi chapter 3 and verse 17,

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:32.730
Jehovah says about his people.

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:34.730
They will be mine,

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.730
says Jehovah of Armies,

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:40.730
in the day when I produce a special property.

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:43.730
The footnote in the New World translation

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:45.730
gives an alternate rendering

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:47.730
for special property

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:50.730
as treasured possession.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:51.730
Imagine,

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:53.730
in Jehovah's eyes,

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:55.730
even if you have drifted from the flock,

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:58.730
you have not been discarded.

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:00.730
And why?

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:04.730
Because you are still precious to Jehovah.

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:07.730
They are mine, he says,

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:10.730
and he views you as special property,

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.730
as a treasured possession.

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:15.730
That means,

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:16.730
if you're lost,

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:19.730
Jehovah wants you to be found.

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:21.730
If you're hurt,

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:23.730
he wants you to be healed.

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:25.730
And we do too.

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:26.730
After all,

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:29.730
you are our fathers and mothers,

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:31.730
sons and daughters,

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:34.730
brothers and sisters.

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:36.730
We long for the day

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:38.730
that you will be reunited with us

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:43.730
so that we can serve Jehovah together once again.

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:46.730
The message then is clear.

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:49.730
This is the time.

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:51.730
There is no better place to be

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:55.730
than in the protective arms of Jehovah.

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:57.730
He is searching for you

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:01.730
and inviting you to come back home.

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:03.730
Please,

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:06.730
act now without delay.
