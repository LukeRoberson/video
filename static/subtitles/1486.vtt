00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:07.030
WBBR radio and stations like it was a way for the small number of kingdom proclaimers

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:11.910
to reach millions in populated areas with the good news.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.190
In an archived interview, Brother Robert Hatsfeld explains his privilege to have been part

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.780
of that historic method of preaching.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:32.859
I was born in 1903 in Pittsburgh and Allegheny and been a very, very interesting lifetime

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:37.299
I've had down through these years.

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:42.219
The group that I was in in the neighborhood, the two of us decided we were going to go

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:45.820
to see radio operators on ships.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:52.060
In order to get the license, we had to be able to send and receive telegraph messages.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:01:02.299
And so the two of us came to New York and we went to the RCA school to learn telegraph.

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:08.700
When I was going to school and living on Manhattan, I was going to the meetings, was only

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.180
one meeting at that time for all the brothers throughout the home metropolitan area, inside

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.659
and outside the city, in a rented hall in the Masonic Temple that's still down here

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.540
in Lafayette Avenue.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:28.459
It was a New York church of international Bible students and when I told the brothers

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:35.340
that I was figuring on going to see as a telegraph operator, they said, well, why go to see,

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.140
we have a radio station.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:50.620
Then a little later, I came over to Bethel here to see what it was all about and one of

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:57.819
the brothers, for its secretaries, brother Haslet came out and interviewed me and I was

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:02.900
told that I should finish the course, get my license and then come over.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.819
So that's how I got the Bethel.

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:12.460
I got my license in December, came to Bethel and got involved in any kind of electrical

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:19.979
work, anything at all and operating the radio transmitter.

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:30.699
The Rutherford had broadcast in Philadelphia from the Opera House about 1921 and he and

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:37.300
other elders decided that this was Jehovah's Provision, radio, was Jehovah's Provision

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.740
to get this truth spread out.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.180
There was no way for a couple hundred witnesses to witness to the millions and millions of

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.780
people in the metropolitan area, get along the world.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:59.819
So they decided that since you couldn't go out and buy a radio station, we'll build one.

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:10.379
And they got together and they bought a wilderness out Staten Island that needed to be cleaned

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:17.580
out, all the brush cleaned out, land leveled off and we're going to build a radio station.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:24.139
So they built a big house, really big house, that can prove to be very useful down through

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:27.210
the years.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:36.169
So they built another smaller building alongside of the house, had the radio transmitter in

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:43.930
the one end of it and then the studio in the same building in the spring of 1924.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.610
The first program was put on.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:55.370
The programs were made up by using all the things that the society published were used

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.969
in some kind of a program.

00:03:57.969 --> 00:03:59.530
We had all kinds of programs.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:07.289
We had to put on some music and we had real good music and we had the seven piece orchestra

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:16.209
would play on a everyday program and then we had the augmented orchestra of brothers

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:27.389
coming out from Bethel and playing over the weekend.

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:38.230
We had bought a used transmitter 500 watts to get started and that was enough of power

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:48.709
with that single wire antenna that in the early days that was heard all over a very, very

00:04:48.709 --> 00:04:57.310
large area because there wasn't many stations and there wasn't much electrical interference.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:07.589
But then this first transmitter was replaced in 1927 by a brand new Western electric transmitter

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:09.629
of a thousand watts.

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:15.550
That made a considerable increase in our territory that we were covering.

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:22.069
With very little interference, people would sit down with their phones and try to receive

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:28.589
distant programs and pay attention when they heard something good that they were interested

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:33.829
and they really paid attention because there wasn't a whole lot of other things to distract

00:05:33.829 --> 00:05:36.750
them and take them away from it.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.990
That was an evening's entertainment to sit down and listen to the radio.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:50.329
The commercial programs, of course, were, some of them were interesting but the Bible

00:05:50.329 --> 00:05:54.949
message appealed to a lot of people in those days.

00:05:54.949 --> 00:06:01.910
This message was a life-giving message that we had, it was a matter of life and death

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:09.189
really and we know that without your whole self, nothing would have happened.

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:17.430
So it worked out very well right from the beginning that we were broadcasting the message

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:26.649
of the kingdom over the radio.

00:06:26.649 --> 00:06:32.329
Brother Hatsfeld served at Bethel for almost 75 years before finishing his earthly course

00:06:32.329 --> 00:06:35.529
in 2001 at the age of 98.
