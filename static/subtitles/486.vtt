00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.259
Our text today is discussing hospitality,

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:10.259
and as we know hospitality includes generously giving to others.

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:14.259
But you may have noted that our comments makes a very profound statement.

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:21.260
It says that hospitality is one of the finest antidotes to loneliness.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
Have you ever been lonely?

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
Really lonely.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
Loneliness can be quite painful.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.259
As we know, it's possible to be lonely even when we're surrounded by people.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.259
One writer stated,

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:36.259
Solitude is pleasant.

00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:38.259
Loneliness is not.

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:42.259
Another described loneliness is being like being in the rain,

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:46.259
and the sky holds nothing but the promise of more clouds.

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:50.259
One sister described the feeling of loneliness as slipping down a deep well,

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:54.259
and the further she slipped, the darker things became.

00:00:55.259 --> 00:01:00.259
So what can help us to deal with loneliness before we sink too deep?

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:02.259
What can help us start climbing back out of that well

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:06.260
or pushing those clouds out into the sky?

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:14.260
Well, as our text says, hospitality, generosity, giving is one of the finest antidotes to loneliness.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
Now, why is that?

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.260
Well, let's consider three scriptural principles as to why that is the case.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
And we'll see why this is true.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
Look first at Acts chapter 20 and verse 35.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
Let's read that together.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
Acts chapter 20 and verse 35,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
and we'll see our first promise.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.260
And here it says,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.260
I have shown you in all things

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
that by working hard in this way,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
you must assist those who are weak.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.260
And must keep in mind the words of the Lord Jesus when He Himself said,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.260
there's more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.260
So our first point is very simply that giving makes us happy.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
Now, the apostle Paul here is quoting Jesus

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.260
and you notice Jesus was not saying that we give when we are happy

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
or we give because we are happy.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.260
He says that we are happy because we give.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.259
Now, that's significant because that tells us that even when we force ourselves to give,

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.259
even if we don't feel like it,

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:15.259
we will experience happiness.

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:19.259
At researchers today have confirmed with Jesus new all along,

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:24.259
they even state possibly that giving releases endorphins in the brain

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:27.259
that helps us with serenity and with contentment.

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:31.259
So our first point is that giving makes us happy.

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:38.599
For a second promise, look at Hebrews chapter 13 and verse 16.

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.599
Hebrews chapter 13 and verse 16.

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:42.599
It says,

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:47.599
moreover, do not forget to do good and to share what you have with others.

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.599
For God is well pleased with such sacrifices.

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.599
So our second point is that giving puts us in a special relationship with Jehovah.

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.599
Jehovah is well pleased when we are hospitable when we give to others.

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.599
Now, what does that cause him to do?

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.599
Well, we may think of Paul's words in Philippians chapter 4 verses 18 and 19

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.599
the Apostle Paul was commending the Philippian congregation

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.599
because they generously helped him, helped Paul.

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:22.599
And so Paul said in response that Jehovah would fully supply according to their need.

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.599
So giving puts us in a special relationship with Jehovah

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.599
where precious to Jehovah any promises that he will fill all of our needs,

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.599
including our emotional needs.

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.599
Now, we may hear that and we say, well, now wait a minute.

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.599
It is true that when I give, when I'm hospitable,

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:43.599
I am happy for the time, but then later loneliness comes back again.

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.599
Does that mean that this scripture, this principle does not apply to me?

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:47.599
No.

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:52.599
Just think about what Jesus said in Matthew chapter 6 verses 25 and 33.

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.599
Remember there, Jesus said, do not be anxious about what we're going to eat

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:00.599
or what we're going to drink because Jehovah will give us what we need when we need it.

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.599
And we trust that statement.

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:05.599
But do we take that to mean that if we're hungry,

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:08.599
we're going through a difficult time and Jehovah gives us something,

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.599
takes care of our needs that will never feel hungry again?

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:14.599
No, later that day, the next day we're hungry again.

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:15.599
What's the point?

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:20.600
The point is that Jehovah will make sure that we have what we need when we need it.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.600
Well, it's the same with our emotional needs.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.600
Jehovah does not say that we will never feel lonely.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.600
We will never feel down or depressed, but he assures us that if we give to others,

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.600
if we are hospitable, he will make sure that we have what we need

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.600
so that we can be happy and fulfilled in life.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.600
So that's our second promise.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.600
Giving puts us in a special relationship with Jehovah

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.600
and he will supply our needs.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.600
For our third one, let's look at Luke chapter 6 and verse 38.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.600
Luke chapter 6 and verse 38.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.600
And this principle or this promise is that Jehovah makes sure

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.600
that we always receive much more than we give.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.600
Luke 6, 38 says, practice giving and people will give to you.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.600
They will pour into your laps a fine measure.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.600
Press down, shaken together and overflowing.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:16.600
For at the measure you are measuring out, they will measure out to you in return.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.600
So Jehovah always makes sure that we receive much more than we give

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.600
and we believe that scripture.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.600
But all of us have hit points in our time when we feel like we are just giving,

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.600
giving, maybe in the congregation and the family or situation in our life we're giving

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.600
and we're just not getting anything back.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.600
Well, what then?

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.600
Does that mean the scripture is not true?

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.600
Well, no, Jesus understood that.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.600
What happened? Notice the way it's worded.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.600
He says, practice giving and people will give to you.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.600
People, not necessarily the ones that we're giving to.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.600
See, with the measure that you measure out,

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.600
keep they, people will give to you in return.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.600
So what's the point?

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.600
The point is that Jehovah promises that if we practice giving,

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.600
if we practice strengthening our brothers, we practice hospitality,

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.600
Jehovah will ensure through one way or another that we receive the blessings,

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.600
the strength and the encouragement to continue.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.600
Now, does this formula work?

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.600
Well, it does and we'll tell you an experience.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.600
I'll tell you an experience of a sister we'll call Lydia.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.600
Now, Lydia was a single sister, a regular pioneer.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.600
And though she had her normal down days as everybody does,

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.600
Lydia was known as a generous and hospitable sister.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.600
She always had gatherings at her home.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.600
She would invite the whole field service group to her home for breakfast

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.600
before we'd go out and service, or she would do other outings,

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.600
special outings for older ones.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.600
Well, then Lydia was diagnosed with cancer.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.600
And this hit her very, very hard.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.600
And then she later had to have surgery.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.600
And Lydia sank into a very, very deep depression,

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.600
such that the elders, the congregation,

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:03.600
even her friends wondered if she would ever be able to pull out of it.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.600
Well, finally, on one shepherding call, two elders went to visit her.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.600
And they read with her, Luke 6, verse 38,

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.600
the scripture that we just consider.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:16.600
And they reminded her of how generous, how hospitable she used to be in the past.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.600
And how this brought her such happiness.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.600
And she acknowledged it was true, but she says,

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.600
I just don't want to be around people anymore.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.600
I can't be around people.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.600
So these two brothers challenged her in a kind way

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.600
to prayerfully try to force herself to give,

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.600
just for a few months and see how things worked out.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.600
And to everybody's surprise, she did.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.600
And it was like the clouds parted,

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.600
and the old Lydia came back again.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.600
Now, that was many years ago.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.600
And Lydia still has her down days,

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:52.600
just like everybody does, but she is again a happy and productive servant of Jehovah.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.600
Well, it's the lesson.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:08:02.600
Well, hospitality, generosity, giving is one of the finest antidotes to loneliness and depression.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:07.600
If we give, Jehovah promises that we will get back in return.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:13.600
Now, there's a beautiful account that reminds us that we cannot out-give Jehovah.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.600
And we know this one in 2 Chronicles, chapter 25.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.600
Let's look at that together.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.600
2 Chronicles 25, starting there in verse 5.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.600
This is speaking about Amazaya, the king.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.600
He's 25 years old, king of Judah.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:31.600
And this is at a time when he's facing a conflict with the Edomites.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.600
Verse 5 says that he gathers in Judah,

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:40.600
and he identifies 300,000 skilled warriors to serve in the army.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.600
But he feels that that's not enough, so you look at verse 6,

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:49.600
and he goes out and he hires 100,000 soldiers from Israel for a hundred silver talents.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.600
Now, verse 7, the man of the true God comes and says,

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.600
send the 100,000 soldiers of Israel back because Jehovah is not with Israel.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.600
Go with the 300,000 you have, and I'll be with you.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.600
Well, you look at the beginning of verse 9.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.600
2 Chronicles 25 and verse 9, the king says,

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.600
but what about the money I paid out?

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.600
Now, that was no small change.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.600
According to the appendix B14 in the back of our Bible,

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:23.600
those hundred silver talents would be worth about 1.5 million today in today's money in silver.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.600
So the king put out a lot of money to hire those soldiers.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.600
Now, the prophet just says, just send them away.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:33.600
But it's the next words that are so reassuring in the context of what we're talking about today.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.600
Notice that in verse 9, the latter part of it,

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.600
it says, the man of the true God replied,

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:44.600
Jehovah has the means to give you much more than that.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.600
Don't worry about it.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.600
Jehovah has the means to give you much more than that.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.600
You cannot outgive Jehovah.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:57.600
So in the context of our discussion, Jehovah promises that if we are hospitable,

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:02.600
if we are generous, if we are giving, we will be happy.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.600
He guarantees that he'll supply all of our needs,

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:12.600
even our emotional needs, and he will move others to give back to us much more than we ever could give.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:20.600
So may we be determined to practice giving, practice hospitality, practice generosity, and every time we do,

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:27.600
we will push the clouds farther back into the sky, and we will always receive much more than we give.
