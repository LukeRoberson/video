00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.739
In Nehemiah's day, the Jews joyfully embarked on a massive building project.

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:22.739
With Jehovah's direction and help, they were able to finish the work in just 52 days.

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:24.739
You look like you've been working.

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:30.739
During the production of the film, Nehemiah, the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:41.039
The walls of Jerusalem were built once again, but this time at Mount Ebo Studios in Brewster, New York.

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:46.770
A variety of skills were needed to produce this drama.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:55.770
With many volunteers coming together using their time, energy and abilities to create an accurate teaching tool.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:15.219
And they found great joy in their work.

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:21.870
Good planning was needed right at the start of production.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:29.299
Every day began with a scriptural discussion and prayer.

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:41.209
The costume and makeup departments prepared the actors to appear on set.

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:46.209
Assistance was provided to help actors feel more comfortable in front of the cameras.

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:59.209
Brothers, please, have they tacked anyone yet?

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:02.209
No, but they will.

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:11.250
While the production team was filming in one studio, sets were being prepared on another.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:21.699
To add to the realism, detailed props were made, many using 3D printing.

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:26.699
With all of these researched and crafted costumes, sets and props combined,

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:31.699
environments were designed to accurately recreate the time period.

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:41.250
But even more was needed to convey what it was like to live in Jerusalem during Nehemiah's day.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.250
For example, there were many animals on set.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:03:20.069
Even after principal filming was completed, sets built in the studio were extended using advanced visual effects.

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.699
Digital construction work was done by the visual effects team.

00:03:25.699 --> 00:04:13.259
Yes, building is a legacy of God's people.

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:22.410
Nehemiah was one of many who throughout history devoted their energies to supporting the work of building.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:29.410
In a similar way, the production team that made Nehemiah the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold,

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:37.410
joyfully worked hard to produce a film that helps build love and appreciation in the hearts of God's people.
