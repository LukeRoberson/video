00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:09.060
I love my family very much.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.539
Even though we don't have a lot, we're glad we have each other.

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:22.820
Mom works really hard to provide for us.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:34.670
It's just the four of us.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:43.740
We've all been feeling just a little sadly.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.899
I can tell she's really tired and worries a lot.

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.460
I try to help out.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.579
Sometimes I help to get everyone ready for the meeting.

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:14.489
We seem to manage our right, but things are really hard.

00:01:14.489 --> 00:01:18.489
I think the elders could tell we were struggling.

00:01:18.489 --> 00:01:19.890
They came to visit us.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:38.159
They were so loving.

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:45.920
They really listened to Mom and even read her some scriptures.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.200
They helped her to see that Jehovah still cared about all of us.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:59.280
That we still have the love of the congregation to strengthen us.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.819
I could tell Mom felt a lot better afterwards.

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:12.139
At our next family worship, Mom read to us 2 Corinthians 8.1 to 4.

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:15.139
That story is about the Macedonians.

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:20.419
Mom had us close our eyes so we can imagine the scene.

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:26.379
Even though the Macedonians were very poor, they found happiness by giving what they could

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.500
others.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:43.050
They even begged the apostles for the opportunity to give.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.770
Then we read Acts 2035 where it says,

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:54.289
There is more happiness and giving than there is and receiving, like Sister said.

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:56.849
But we don't have anything to give.

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.449
Mom said, but we do.

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:59.449
We have ourselves.

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:05.879
It got us all thinking.

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.680
Mom had a great idea.

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:55.389
We spent the rest of our family worship making special gifts for the friends and our congregation.

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:58.229
It was pretty amazing.

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:04.270
Even though we don't have a lot materially, there is still so much we can give.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:10.509
Like putting a little in the contribution box each week and helping to clean.

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:16.350
And of course, sharing in the ministry is the very best way we can give to others.

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:30.319
Now we are even closer as a family.

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:34.399
And we have learned that there truly is more happiness and giving.
