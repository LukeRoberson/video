00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:08.300
Greetings. This is J.W. Broadcasting for January 2025.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:33.700
In last month's broadcast, we shared part one of the 2024 annual meeting.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.700
It included uplifting talks and videos and that is more to share.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.700
Please enjoy part two of the annual meeting.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.700
The next part of our program relates to the remarkable response

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:55.700
we've seen to Jehovah's Mercy express to those who had been removed from the congregation.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:01.700
It's a video entitled Blessings of Jehovah's Mercy. Please enjoy.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:26.599
The governing body has prayerfully considered how Jehovah's Mercy could be better reflected when dealing with wrongdoers in the congregation.

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:33.599
In his love, Jehovah wants sinners to become reconciled to him if at all possible.

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:40.599
He doesn't want anyone to be destroyed, so he appeals to them to repent.

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:43.599
And we see these pictures, you know, illustrations about,

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:48.599
there might be a drawing or something that shows a shepherd going after that one large sheep.

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:52.599
And you think that's really nice? You know, in concept, oh, that's good.

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:56.599
But it's not just an academic concept. It's reality.

00:01:56.599 --> 00:02:03.599
The fact that he loves people in this way, even those who have been removed from the congregation,

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:10.599
just gives me an opportunity to reflect that same love that Jehovah has and extend that to others as well.

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:16.599
The elders in our circuit promptly responded to the adjustments.

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:22.599
Once they heard the update, we got the printed direction, the brothers promptly met together.

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:31.599
With the fellow elders, we all discuss how we can help all these ones in our territory that have been removed from the congregation.

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:38.849
And we visited them. They were grateful that they were not forgotten. They are still remembered.

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:49.849
It's heartwarming to hear reports of how Jehovah has blessed congregation elders as they search for those who have been removed from the congregation.

00:02:49.849 --> 00:03:01.849
For example, in the first four months after the 2024 governing body update number two in the South Africa and Philippines branched territories combined,

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:09.849
more than 1,200 have come back to the congregation here in the United States branched territory.

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:15.849
Over 5,000 brothers and sisters have been welcomed back.

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:22.849
In the Brazil branched territory, some 5,200 publishers have been reinstated.

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:31.849
And in the Central America branched territory, over 5,300 individuals have come back to the congregation.

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:44.830
The numbers are exciting, but we can't overlook that each of these dear ones have returned to Jehovah and Jehovah loves them.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:50.830
One man came to mind because he's deaf and blind, and he'd been away from Jehovah for 45 years.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:58.830
We prayed with him, we asked him where he was with things, and he said, I want to be back. I want to be back in the family.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:05.830
That's what he said. He's been studying regularly and attending the meetings ever since then, and he was reinstated about a month later.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:14.830
When I tacked child that announcement for him that night, I said, you're back in the family. You're a Jehovah's witness again, and he was just overjoyed at that.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:23.829
There's a pioneer sister in our circuit that was asked to conduct a study with a young mom who's trying to make her way back to Jehovah.

00:04:23.829 --> 00:04:29.829
She was so excited after the first study. She said that first study went so well.

00:04:29.829 --> 00:04:35.829
It seems like everyone in the congregation is very happy just to have this arrangement in place.

00:04:35.829 --> 00:04:44.829
A sister told me it made her so happy to see that young mom who's studying, smiling again. She hadn't seen it in a long time.

00:04:44.829 --> 00:04:54.829
One experience that is exciting is that this man has been removed for over 30 years, but he started coming to the meetings early this year.

00:04:54.829 --> 00:05:05.829
But he would sit at the back and not talk to anyone. But eventually after this arrangement has been made available when we visited him, he was so excited.

00:05:05.829 --> 00:05:12.829
Because he said, I didn't know what to do to come back to the congregation, and here we are visiting him.

00:05:12.829 --> 00:05:19.829
And he says he felt like a heavyweight has been lifted off his shoulders, and he has been reinstated.

00:05:19.829 --> 00:05:24.829
A young man that I studied the Bible was who came into the truth under great difficulty.

00:05:24.829 --> 00:05:36.829
And so we thought of him immediately. And right away I sent him a message because I still had his phone number and said, please watch this governing body update that I sent him the link.

00:05:37.829 --> 00:05:49.829
Well, the next day I received a reply to this message, and there was a photo of a letter that he had written to the congregation body of elders asking to be reinstated.

00:05:49.829 --> 00:06:00.829
I wrote back very excitedly and said, have you actually watched the update? And he said, yes, since yesterday I have watched this update six times.

00:06:00.829 --> 00:06:14.829
Well, of course our hearts were absolutely overflowing. But it was even we were even happier when about a month later he was writing us to say, I have finally been reinstated.

00:06:14.829 --> 00:06:27.829
The sister that was asked to conduct a study with a person and she says, the greatest gift I've ever gotten is to study with someone who has been removed from the congregation.

00:06:28.829 --> 00:06:42.829
So her experience of crying with her, telling her that she liked her bag and the student says, I bought this bag years ago so I could go out and service when I got ready.

00:06:42.829 --> 00:06:51.829
When I was reinstated, showed her that she had been trying for a long time to come back but just did not know how.

00:06:51.829 --> 00:07:01.829
And so the student now realizes that that was Jehovah, that is helping her and she feels grateful to be helped to come back.

00:07:01.829 --> 00:07:12.829
By sitting on that Bible study with someone who was removed from the congregation and seeing the benefit helped me to see the depth of Jehovah's mercy.

00:07:12.829 --> 00:07:27.829
Because this young man has been removed from the congregation for nine years. He has wanted to come back, he mentioned, but he just didn't have the strength to make steps to come back.

00:07:27.829 --> 00:07:38.829
One person had been removed from the congregation some 17 years ago and on his own he was watching JW Broadcasting.

00:07:39.829 --> 00:07:45.829
He saw the update, he said, this is, it's time to come home.

00:07:45.829 --> 00:08:02.170
And so he called the kingdom hall, he left a voicemail and the brothers received his message, they reached right out to him.

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:13.170
A Bible study was started and very happily, he too has progressed, progressed to being reinstated and his parents were able to fly in

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:21.170
and be there at the kingdom hall that night, he was reinstated. He later said this is truly a homecoming.

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:37.669
I feel like it helps us to see another side of Jehovah as our father and you see how much he loves his children and then he allows us to have a part in helping them to come back to him.

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:43.669
And so we get to reflect his mercy too, it's such a privilege.

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:50.669
Back in 1979 my father was removed from the congregation and I was eight.

00:08:50.669 --> 00:09:01.669
You can grow up thinking, okay, maybe my dad will come back in, a decade goes by, two decades goes by, three decades goes by.

00:09:01.669 --> 00:09:11.669
And you don't want to lose hope, but it does tend to make you think that maybe this person might not ever come back.

00:09:11.669 --> 00:09:24.669
I get a phone call and it's a friend of mine I've known for many years. He and another brother went to go see my dad and he even accepted a study.

00:09:24.669 --> 00:09:46.399
At this point, I said, wow, I said that's great because most of my childhood and my entire adult life, I have not known a father who was serving Jehovah.

00:09:46.399 --> 00:10:00.100
You should never, ever underestimate the lengths Jehovah will go to to save one sheep, one sheep.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:26.700
If you weren't a believer in Jehovah's mercy before, no one will ever be able to say when everything is over in the system of things that Jehovah didn't care enough, he didn't make the efforts, he didn't send anybody out.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:54.480
You really can't say that because Jehovah is making sure that the extra effort was made.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:11:36.320
Very touching indeed, but it wasn't just a one-time invitation in an imitation of our father Jehovah, the elders continue to try to render assistance to those who have been removed from the congregation, they continue to reach out to them.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:44.320
But Jehovah is more than just a God of mercy, what's the connection with his righteousness and his justice?

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:51.320
Brother Kenneth Cook will now discuss the theme, help to tear down and to build up.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:57.320
Well, we certainly have learned much during the past few years regarding Jehovah's mercy, haven't we?

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:07.320
In fact, even just today we've highlighted how we now have a broader understanding of Jehovah's mercy during the Great Tribulation.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:25.320
The May 2024 watchtower stated this, even after the Great Tribulation starts, it is possible that some who see the destruction of Babylon the Great will recall that Jehovah's Witnesses had long spoken of this event.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:32.320
Might some who see these events have a change of heart and of quote, well, it could be.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:36.320
And if so, we'll be happy for them, won't we?

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:42.320
Then there's Jehovah's mercy in welcoming repentant ones back into the congregation.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:47.320
Again, we've been highlighting this and properly so, what a beautiful thing.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:51.320
The August 2024 watchtower stated,

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:59.320
Jehovah does not condone unrepentant wrongdoing, however, he does not turn his back on wrongdoers.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.320
He wants them to return.

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:10.320
Jehovah's feelings toward unrepentant wrongdoers are pardon me, repentant wrongdoers are expressed at Hosea 14 and verse 4.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:15.320
And he says towards such repentant ones here, he quoted in the article,

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:24.320
I will heal their unfaithfulness, I will love them of my own free will, because my anger has turned away.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:39.320
The article continued, what a strong incentive for elders to respond to any sign of repentance, and what a strong incentive for those who have left Jehovah to return without delay.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:48.320
Well, throughout the Scriptures, we see Jehovah's warm appeal to wrongdoers urging them to repent.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:53.320
At Zechariah 1 and verse 3, we read that Jehovah told his prophet,

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.320
say to them,

00:13:55.320 --> 00:14:03.320
This is what Jehovah of Army says, return to me, declares Jehovah of armies, and I will return to you.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:14.320
But does our increased understanding of Jehovah's mercy here mean that his righteous and just standards have somehow been changed?

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:23.320
Also in line with our theme, what thing should we properly tear down and what thing should we desire to build up?

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:32.320
According to Ecclesiastes chapter 3 and verse 3, it's scriptural to do both as needed.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:37.320
Along with the opening comment from verse 1, verse 3 reads in part,

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:46.320
there is an appointed time for everything, a time to tear down, and a time to build up.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:55.320
So then to answer our questions, let's examine Jehovah's love of righteousness, justice, and mercy.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:15:04.320
At Psalm 33 and verse 5, the inspired writer highlights that Jehovah loves righteousness and justice.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:13.320
Also, Jesus' words recorded at Matthew 9 and verse 13 highlight that Jehovah wants mercy, not sacrifice.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:18.320
Saint Jehovah loves each of these qualities.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:27.320
How does he balance what he righteously chooses to tear down with what he mercifully chooses to build up?

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:32.320
He does so by knowing how these qualities work together.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.320
Now, some things just go together.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:37.320
Let's just make it every day real life.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:42.320
It illustrates, for some people, an ice cream Sunday,

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:50.320
it's not complete unless it includes chocolate sauce, whipped cream, sprinkles, and what else?

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:53.320
The cherry on top, right?

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.320
The combination is what defines it.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:06.320
Well, far more importantly, on a spiritual level, our love of righteousness and our acts of justice must include mercy

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.320
whenever possible.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:14.320
Jehovah requires that we uphold all of his righteous standards.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:23.320
So to answer a question from earlier, James 117 tells us that Jehovah does not vary or change.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:28.320
And quoting Jehovah himself, Malachi 3 and verse 6 says,

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:33.320
I am Jehovah, I do not change.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.320
So then, Jehovah doesn't change.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:41.320
And his standards as to what is right and wrong have not changed.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:47.320
That is why recent adjustments to our view of God's mercy are just that.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:52.320
Adjustments to our view or understanding.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.320
Have you been able to adjust?

00:16:55.320 --> 00:17:02.320
Jesus too loves righteousness, justice, and mercy, and like his father, he does not change.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:11.319
Hebrews 138 says of Jesus that he is the same yesterday and today and forever.

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:20.319
This means that what Jesus did while he was on earth teaches us about his thinking now, right now.

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:31.319
For example, Jesus displayed intense love for righteousness and justice by driving out the money changers from the temple area on two occasions.

00:17:31.319 --> 00:17:41.319
The money changers were extorting the people and they were turning Jehovah's house into a house of commerce and Jesus hated that.

00:17:41.319 --> 00:17:43.319
He hated it.

00:17:43.319 --> 00:17:48.319
Jesus' zeal for what is right moved him to act.

00:17:48.319 --> 00:17:55.319
And in doing so, he also demonstrated his merciful concern for the people.

00:17:55.319 --> 00:18:02.319
Above all, we see in such actions the love that Jesus has for the pure worship of his father.

00:18:02.319 --> 00:18:11.319
And because Jesus doesn't change, he still has the same desire to drive out what is bad.

00:18:11.319 --> 00:18:14.319
The wickedness of this world increases.

00:18:14.319 --> 00:18:23.319
We know that Jehovah and his son will always do what is right, what is just, and what is merciful.

00:18:23.319 --> 00:18:30.319
At Exodus 34, verses 6 and 7, we find a summary of Jehovah's balanced qualities.

00:18:30.319 --> 00:18:43.319
Now it reads in part, Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and compassionate, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love and truth,

00:18:43.319 --> 00:18:56.319
showing loyal love to thousands, pardoning error and transgression and sin, but he will by no means leave the guilty unpunished.

00:18:56.319 --> 00:19:08.319
Well, knowing that Jehovah will by no means leave the guilty unpunished, what thing should we then help to tear down or send away from the congregations?

00:19:08.319 --> 00:19:22.319
At the same time, knowing that Jehovah is merciful and compassionate as stated there, what thing should we then help to build up and welcome back into the congregation?

00:19:22.319 --> 00:19:30.319
We'll look at an interesting account in Zechariah chapter 5, as well as some other accounts and find some answers.

00:19:30.319 --> 00:19:39.319
As we do, look for the lessons that we can apply to our efforts to show righteousness, justice, and mercy.

00:19:39.319 --> 00:19:46.319
So then first of all, what should we tear down and send out?

00:19:46.319 --> 00:19:53.319
The concept of tearing down is not difficult to see when we think of it in terms of a building.

00:19:53.319 --> 00:20:00.319
Some houses are just beyond repair, and for this reason they must be torn down.

00:20:00.319 --> 00:20:08.319
The house and disillustration makes that point, doesn't it? I don't think you're going to fix that one.

00:20:08.319 --> 00:20:12.319
Have that in mind as we consider what Zechariah saw.

00:20:12.319 --> 00:20:25.319
Now Zechariah was a prophet who was favored with seeing some amazing God-given visions, and what he said describes real conditions that existed in Israel at the time.

00:20:25.319 --> 00:20:34.319
At Zechariah 5 and verse 2, we read that an angel asks Zechariah, what do you see?

00:20:34.319 --> 00:20:41.319
Zechariah replies that he sees a very large flying scroll depicted here.

00:20:41.319 --> 00:20:51.319
The flying scroll was written on both sides and contains a curse that tears down the houses of wickedness leaving evil exposed.

00:20:51.319 --> 00:20:56.319
One side of the scroll targets those who steal.

00:20:56.319 --> 00:21:02.319
The other side targets those who lie or who make false oaths.

00:21:02.319 --> 00:21:08.319
After the house is consumed or torn down, he next sees an ifa container.

00:21:08.319 --> 00:21:14.319
It contains a figurative woman referred to as wickedness who is trying to escape.

00:21:14.319 --> 00:21:25.319
She is exposed, and the angel treats her appropriately by throwing her back into the container and thrusting a heavy lead weight over it.

00:21:25.319 --> 00:21:31.319
The container with wickedness is then removed from the land.

00:21:31.319 --> 00:21:40.319
The angels' actions leave no doubt about how Jehovah views such things.

00:21:40.319 --> 00:21:44.319
What lessons can we take away from the vision?

00:21:44.319 --> 00:21:52.319
Well, first, we see that Jehovah does not tolerate wickedness such as lying and stealing.

00:21:52.319 --> 00:22:01.319
We find scriptural examples of this and how Jehovah dealt with greedy aiken or what happened with Ananias and Sapphira.

00:22:01.319 --> 00:22:04.319
We know those accounts, don't we?

00:22:04.319 --> 00:22:09.319
God's word lists many things that Jehovah does not tolerate.

00:22:09.319 --> 00:22:19.319
For instance, Proverbs 6 verses 16 through 19 speaks of Jehovah's hatred for a lying tongue,

00:22:19.319 --> 00:22:31.319
hands that shed innocent blood, a heart plotting wicked schemes, or a false witness who lies with every breath and so forth.

00:22:31.319 --> 00:22:43.319
And Revelation 21-8 speaks of everlasting destruction for those who unrepentantly practice what isn't moral.

00:22:43.319 --> 00:22:52.319
Well, next, we learn from Sekhira's vision that Jehovah uses his faithful angels to expose wickedness.

00:22:52.319 --> 00:23:04.319
The lesson? Treat wickedness like Jehovah and his faithful angels do by tearing it down, exposing it, and removing it from the congregation.

00:23:04.319 --> 00:23:06.319
Expose and remove.

00:23:06.319 --> 00:23:12.319
We do not want the conduct of unrepentant ones to take up residence in our congregations.

00:23:13.319 --> 00:23:24.319
That is why, since sin is still on the earth, the elders will continue to remove unrepentant ones from the congregation.

00:23:24.319 --> 00:23:38.369
Nevertheless, while there are things that we must send out from the congregation, what must we help to build it up and welcome back into the congregation?

00:23:38.369 --> 00:23:52.369
When wrongdoing is removed from among Jehovah's people and they are united together in clean and pure worship, Jehovah sees this and his people are blessed.

00:23:52.369 --> 00:24:00.369
Malachi 3 verse 16 tells us that he is paying attention and he is listening.

00:24:00.369 --> 00:24:07.369
For those who properly fear him, he places their names in his book of remembrance. What a privilege.

00:24:08.369 --> 00:24:19.369
Even so, to keep his blessing, we must also imitate his mercy and remain ready to welcome back repentant ones.

00:24:19.369 --> 00:24:29.369
Like the concept of tearing down, the concept of building up is not difficult to picture when you think of it in terms of a building.

00:24:30.369 --> 00:24:40.369
Now, some houses are in bad shape, but they are not beyond repair, like the one we saw earlier, they can be restored as illustrated on screen.

00:24:40.369 --> 00:24:45.369
It is in bad shape, but look at that. It can be fixed up.

00:24:45.369 --> 00:24:57.369
With that in mind, when it comes to welcoming back and building up repentant ones, we are helped to do this when we imitate Jesus and the faithful angels.

00:24:57.369 --> 00:25:04.369
They have not only witnessed Jehovah's mercy from the start, but they have developed this quality themselves.

00:25:04.369 --> 00:25:13.369
Here is what we mean. When humans were first created, mercy was not needed because humans were perfect.

00:25:13.369 --> 00:25:24.369
Only after the rebellion, when the first imperfect child was born, did this aspect of Jehovah's love and compassion become evident.

00:25:25.369 --> 00:25:34.369
Jesus and the angels witnessed Jehovah's great love and action when he extended mercy to humans who were born in sin.

00:25:34.369 --> 00:25:44.369
In turn, these faithful angels imitated their Heavenly Father and showed mercy in helping to build up repentant ones on earth.

00:25:45.369 --> 00:25:55.369
For example, Jesus showed mercy to Peter, didn't he, and also to the woman who poured perfumed oil on his feet.

00:25:55.369 --> 00:26:09.369
Jesus used powerful illustrations to help us understand the depth of God's mercy, just reading the parable of the lost Son who returned and Luke 15 makes the point, doesn't it?

00:26:09.369 --> 00:26:16.369
So like Jesus and the faithful angels, we desire to imitate Jehovah's precious qualities, all of them.

00:26:16.369 --> 00:26:22.369
That is why we seek to welcome back and build up repentant ones.

00:26:22.369 --> 00:26:27.369
We do this in harmony with the direction that the congregations have received.

00:26:27.369 --> 00:26:37.369
Now regarding this direction, one person who was removed from the congregation wrote to the governing body, and this is what he said.

00:26:38.369 --> 00:26:45.369
The fact that friends can now say a simple heartfelt greeting blows my mind.

00:26:45.369 --> 00:26:54.369
I have felt like a walking plague walking into the kingdom hall as many friends avoided eye contact and would clear out of the way.

00:26:54.369 --> 00:27:00.369
But I get it. That was our understanding up until that time.

00:27:00.369 --> 00:27:13.369
Jehovah is an amazing one and only true God. His love is always being manifested as in this case to direct you brothers to announce this new arrangement.

00:27:13.369 --> 00:27:18.369
I look forward to receiving a visit from the elders.

00:27:18.369 --> 00:27:23.369
Well, what a fine expression that was.

00:27:23.369 --> 00:27:30.369
Things do change over time. But like that repentant when he gets it and see we get it.

00:27:30.369 --> 00:27:36.369
Jehovah is helping us to understand why these changes come and we comply and we love it.

00:27:36.369 --> 00:27:42.369
As we have considered Jehovah's qualities of love and mercy, though, have not changed.

00:27:42.369 --> 00:27:48.369
But our understanding of his marvelous qualities, well, this has improved.

00:27:48.369 --> 00:27:56.369
Each of us must work to learn the depth of his love and mercy and then show the depth of these things ourselves.

00:27:56.369 --> 00:28:03.369
At the same time, Jehovah's standards of righteousness and justice have not changed.

00:28:03.369 --> 00:28:07.369
Each of us must work to uphold his standards of right and wrong.

00:28:07.369 --> 00:28:19.369
Like the angel and Zechariah's prophecy, elders today must protect Jehovah's people by exposing, restraining and sending out what is bad from the congregation.

00:28:19.369 --> 00:28:34.369
So in summary, while we do not hesitate to tear down wickedness and send it away, we desire to do all that we can to bring back and build up those who return to Jehovah.

00:28:34.369 --> 00:28:48.869
Thank you, Brother Ken. A beautiful talk illustrating Jehovah's mercy and love, yet also his justice and righteousness.

00:28:48.869 --> 00:28:53.869
May we all continue to work hard to reflect those qualities in our life.

00:28:53.869 --> 00:28:59.869
Now, earlier in our program, we saw a trailer for the video, become Jehovah's Friend, the greatest act of love.

00:28:59.869 --> 00:29:06.869
And it ended with the words, coming soon. Well, soon has arrived.

00:29:07.869 --> 00:29:22.109
Let's now enjoy the full length, epic episode, become Jehovah's Friend, the greatest act of love.

00:29:22.109 --> 00:32:09.299
Having a memorial, and you have to come, it's the most important event. This invite is for you and your mom. I can tell you more about it at our study.

00:32:09.299 --> 00:32:15.160
Okay, thanks. See you later, Sophia.

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:21.160
That's right, Camille. Okay, let's move on to the next paragraph. Do you mind reading?

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:27.160
Okay, sure. Many people hope for good things to happen. But they cannot be sure that they're home.

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:46.940
Okay, now it's your turn. Life was perfect. Adam and Eve just thought they'd Jehovah. They lost their perfect life and died. Right. After that, nobody was perfect.

00:32:46.940 --> 00:33:01.940
So everyone would grow old and die. Jesus came to earth and taught everyone about Jehovah. He gave his life. He died for us. That's right. So that in the future, nobody will have to die.

00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:31.200
Has anybody ever given you a special gift? Hmm, they gave it to you because she loved me. Right. Jehovah and Jesus gave us the greatest gift. It costs a lot.

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:40.200
But they gave it to us because they love us. And I want us to live forever. But what about my grandma?

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:49.799
Their gift is for her too. There's somebody in the Bible I would like you to meet. She's a lot like you.

00:33:49.799 --> 00:34:12.059
Luke chapter 7. She lived in a city called Nain. She had a husband and a son.

00:34:12.059 --> 00:36:03.050
Her husband died. She still had her son to keep her company. Her son died too. They both died. She was already a widow. And now she was all alone.

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:54.880
The day of the funeral, Jesus came to Nain. And he saw the widow. Stop weeping. Young man, I say to you, get up.

00:36:54.880 --> 00:37:33.579
He said, Jesus brought him back to life. He loved them. He loves all of us. He loves you. That's why he died for us.

00:37:33.579 --> 00:37:43.579
Jehovah brought Jesus back to life. Soon, Jesus will resurrect people. And because he died for us, we could all live forever.

00:37:43.579 --> 00:37:51.579
It's the greatest gift anyone could give us. When we go to the memorial, it's a way to say thank you.

00:37:51.579 --> 00:37:55.579
Hmm. I hope my mom wants to come too.

00:37:55.579 --> 00:38:08.380
Hi baby. Should we get ready for the memorial?

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:14.380
Oh honey, it was a long day. I'm so sorry. I don't think we can make it.

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:28.820
Wait to see you tonight. Let us know if you need a ride. It's Sophia's mom.

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:40.280
Mom, we can do this. Let's do it.

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:42.280
Yay!

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:53.179
Yes, my little princess. I'm glad you're studying the Bible. Me too.

00:38:53.179 --> 00:39:11.250
At this time, we'll have the passing of the wine. As we all go home tonight, think about what Jesus sacrificed means to you.

00:39:11.250 --> 00:40:54.059
Zoe, turn around.

00:41:03.889 --> 00:41:10.139
Be a girl from us here now.

00:41:10.139 --> 00:41:25.989
Jehovah has shown love in many ways.

00:41:25.989 --> 00:41:49.929
But when he gave Jesus life for us, that was the greatest act of love.

00:41:49.929 --> 00:41:54.929
It's remarkable how even Caleb and Sophia videos can touch our emotions.

00:41:54.929 --> 00:41:59.929
That was not brought to you by artificial intelligence, just so you know.

00:41:59.929 --> 00:42:06.929
Our brothers and sisters, dear brothers and sisters in audio video services, devoted thousands of hours.

00:42:06.929 --> 00:42:25.420
We wish to express thanks to them. And of course, we express thanks to Jehovah for this touching video portrayal.

00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:31.050
Brother Steve, I think part of that applause was for you.

00:42:31.050 --> 00:42:36.050
The next part of our program relates to the cherished hope of living forever.

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:41.050
And brother Lett has been experiencing a little bit of back pain, but he is improving.

00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:45.050
So he just wanted us to relate that before his next talk.

00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:49.050
But he will discuss the theme, Everlasting Life.

00:42:49.050 --> 00:42:51.050
Possible?

00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:58.150
Boring? Brother Lett, you have our attention.

00:42:58.150 --> 00:43:08.150
The good news that we preach has many facets, many aspects, like a gorgeous, multifaceted diamond.

00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:14.150
But now, what is one facet that we especially enjoy teaching people about?

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:22.150
The fact that fateful humans under kingdom rule will never grow old and die.

00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:28.150
Unlike Adam and Eve who threw away the privilege to eat of the tree of life and live forever,

00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:34.150
fateful humans will be granted life without end.

00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:43.150
But now, sometimes when we discuss this aspect of the good news, people will bring up a couple of questions.

00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:49.150
One, they may say, is Everlasting Life really possible?

00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:53.150
It just seems like it's too good to be true.

00:43:53.150 --> 00:44:02.150
And two, if I actually do live forever, will life not eventually become boring?

00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:06.150
Well, let's discuss those two questions during our talk.

00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:15.150
Now, first, how can we be sure that Everlasting Life will become a reality?

00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:24.150
The first and foremost reason, because the God who cannot lie has promised it.

00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:34.150
Revelation 21 4 Jehovah says that He will wipe out every tear and death will be no more.

00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:39.150
And then, in effect, He publicly signs that promise.

00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:47.150
In the next verse, verse 5, He says, right for these words are fateful and true.

00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:53.150
In other words, write it down where everyone can see what I promised and I certify it will happen.

00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:57.150
It will happen. I guarantee it will.

00:44:57.150 --> 00:44:59.150
But now, here's a question.

00:44:59.150 --> 00:45:06.150
What evidence do we have that humans originally were designed to live forever?

00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:10.150
Well, think about the first book of the Bible, the introductory book.

00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:18.150
The first two humans were told if they ate from the tree of the knowledge of good at bad,

00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:21.150
they would certainly die.

00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:23.150
Now, what is implied?

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:30.150
If they didn't eat, they were fateful, obedient, they would still be alive, they would never die.

00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:33.150
How old would Adam be now?

00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:35.150
Little over 6,000 years old.

00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:37.150
Eve, a little bit younger.

00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:39.150
How would they look?

00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:46.150
Just as beautiful handsome, perfect as the day they were created.

00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:48.150
What would be their health condition?

00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:55.150
They would feel just as healthy and vibrant as the day they were created.

00:45:55.150 --> 00:46:00.150
Now, we know they did sin and they died as Jehovah said,

00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:03.150
but his original purpose he was for them to live.

00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:10.150
And that purpose will be fulfilled as scriptures in the Bible certainly verify.

00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:17.150
What's another line of reasoning that we were originally designed to live forever?

00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:23.150
Well, think about the astounding capacity of the human brain.

00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:29.150
Now, scientists in recent years are finding out more and more that the brain has much more capacity

00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:32.150
than they previously thought even just a couple of years ago.

00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:35.150
Here's what a recent study had to say about this.

00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:43.150
It said the average adult human brain's memory capacity is estimated to be

00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:48.150
two and a half million gigabytes.

00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:56.150
Now, if you want to compare that with a smartphone, the average smartphone 150 gigabytes,

00:46:56.150 --> 00:47:00.150
two and a half million gigabytes, the brain?

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:04.150
150, a smartphone.

00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:06.150
No comparison.

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:12.150
In fact, that study went on to say that the brain would never run out of storage capacity

00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:17.150
because new memories keep replacing old wines.

00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:22.150
That happens because new neural connections are formed.

00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:27.150
So the brain was obviously designed to last forever.

00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:29.150
Never fill up.

00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:31.150
Don't give me your name.

00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:33.150
Don't give me any more information.

00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:37.150
My brain is full. I can't take it.

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:40.150
Never reach that point, see?

00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:45.150
Brain could always take more Jehovah made it that way.

00:47:45.150 --> 00:47:51.150
You want to get a little maybe idea about the capacity of the human brain.

00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:58.150
Think about the tremendous download that Jesus received at His baptism.

00:47:58.150 --> 00:48:07.150
Eons of time, the memory of that all downloaded the human brain that Jesus had was able to hold.

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:09.150
That's it. It was a human brain.

00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:11.150
It's perfect, but a human brain.

00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:20.150
The brain obviously is a very, very big place in a very, very small space, isn't it?

00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:23.150
That certainly is the case.

00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:26.150
Now, here's our intriguing question.

00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:37.150
Why would Jehovah create us with a super brain, super capacity if we're only designed to live 70 or 80 years?

00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:39.150
Would even make sense, would it?

00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:46.150
That would be like making a smartphone with two and a half million gigabyte capacity,

00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:51.150
knowing that the user would only use a few hundred gigabytes in his whole lifetime.

00:48:51.150 --> 00:48:58.150
Or like building an automobile with a million horsepower engine,

00:48:58.150 --> 00:49:04.150
knowing the owner would only use a few hundred horsepower during his life.

00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:06.150
It wouldn't make sense, would it?

00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:15.150
The brain obviously loudly proclaims that humans were designed to live forever.

00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:19.150
Now, let's get one more line of reasoning that we're designed to live forever.

00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:26.150
Go to Ecclesiastes, please. Ecclesiastes chapter 3.

00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:30.150
In verse number 11, we'll read the A part, says,

00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:37.150
He, Jehovah, has made everything beautiful in its time.

00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:44.150
He has even put eternity in their heart.

00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:46.150
Now, what does that mean?

00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:57.150
Well, Jehovah has implanted in the hearts of humans the desire, the strong craving to live eternally, to live forever.

00:49:57.150 --> 00:50:00.150
Now, think about it, isn't it true?

00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:08.150
When death lurks at a person's door, we see they keep trying to live, don't they?

00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:14.150
They will pursue doctors, medicine, they will endure all kinds of difficult treatments.

00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:20.150
They want to live. If a person was asked to pick the day on which he wished to die,

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:26.150
most would keep pushing that day farther and farther into the future with them.

00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:29.150
See, they want to keep living.

00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:37.150
See, throughout history, humans have looked for the fountain of youth, the medicine, the elixir, a potion to keep them living,

00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:40.150
and the search certainly continues today.

00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:43.150
But now, here's our intriguing question.

00:50:43.150 --> 00:50:50.150
Why would Jehovah create humans with that strong desire if they're only meant to live 70 or 80 years?

00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:52.150
It'd actually be cruel, wouldn't it?

00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:58.150
Be kind of like you think of this illustration tying a dog on a 20-foot chain

00:50:58.150 --> 00:51:07.150
and putting a juicy steak 21 feet from the post where that chain was secured.

00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:13.150
The dog could see that steak, he could smell that steak, but he couldn't get a bite of it, could he?

00:51:13.150 --> 00:51:18.150
That would be cruel, and we know Jehovah is definitely not a cruel God.

00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:22.150
He's a very loving Heavenly Father.

00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:30.150
Well, the foregoing is just a few reasoning points that humans were designed and will live forever.

00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:33.150
Now, let's get that second question.

00:51:33.150 --> 00:51:40.150
Why do some people reason that living forever would be boring?

00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:45.150
Well, some reason that if everyone lives forever, they're all perfect.

00:51:45.150 --> 00:51:54.150
Will they not all eventually become carbon copies of each other, with variety being lost?

00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:57.150
Well, that reasoning is not sound.

00:51:57.150 --> 00:52:03.150
Our publication is this life all there is, addressed that shallow reasoning.

00:52:03.150 --> 00:52:04.150
Here's what it said.

00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:12.150
It said, life in human perfection does not mean that everyone will be doing all things equally well

00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:15.150
and with the same intense interest.

00:52:15.150 --> 00:52:21.150
What the Bible holds forth is the promise of life without sickness and death.

00:52:21.150 --> 00:52:25.150
Healthy people today are not all alike.

00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:33.150
So why should anyone conclude that bodily and mental perfection would make people virtual copies of one another?

00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:37.150
People will still vary as to personality.

00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:50.150
They will have varying preferences as to work, building, home decoration, landscaping, food and drink, entertainment, the fine arts, and so forth.

00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:52.150
Additionally, think about this.

00:52:52.150 --> 00:53:00.150
There is nothing, absolutely nothing boring about Jehovah or any of his creation.

00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:05.150
I personally can't think of any two things that are exactly identical.

00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:10.150
Even so-called identical twins you're looking at here.

00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:12.150
Notice their teeth are different.

00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:17.880
Their freckle pattern is different.

00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:19.880
Their fingerprints are different.

00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:21.880
Their personalities are different.

00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:23.880
They are certainly not identical.

00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:31.880
In fact, there are no two dogs, no two trees, no two tigers, no two things I can think of.

00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:33.880
They're exactly alike.

00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:35.880
Think about zebras for a moment.

00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:37.880
Now you look at this herd of zebras.

00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:41.880
It looks like they're basically all striped the same.

00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:46.880
No two zebras on the planet striped exactly the same.

00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:57.880
And scientists even think that this is how a baby zebra recognizes and finds his mother in a big herd.

00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:02.880
He memorizes her unique striping pattern.

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:05.880
Isn't it amazing what evolution can do?

00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:16.480
If you believe that, I've got a bridge to sell you.

00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:20.480
It's amazing what Jehovah has done.

00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:24.480
Think about snowflakes for a moment.

00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:34.480
Out of the trillions of snowflakes that fall in one large snowstorm, no two alike.

00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:37.480
Amazing even though all of them are succeeded.

00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:40.480
As you can see here, they're hexagonal.

00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:42.480
But no two alike.

00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:44.480
Nothing boring about Jehovah.

00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:56.480
And you can be sure that humans who are the work of the hands of a God of that kind of infinite variety will never become carbon copies of one another.

00:54:56.480 --> 00:55:08.480
Now another reason though that people think some of them that living forever would be boring, they think that finally you would learn everything to learn.

00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:11.480
You'd do everything there is to do.

00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:14.480
And life would cease to be stimulating.

00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:17.480
It would become drab and uninteresting.

00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:20.480
Well again, such reasoning is not sound.

00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:28.480
First of all, to repeat something that is pleasurable is not boring is it?

00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:30.480
I mean think about eating.

00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:33.480
Most people eat over a thousand meals in a year.

00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:41.480
Does a man who is 40 years old eating over 40,000 meals is he more bored than the 20 year old?

00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:44.480
Who's eaten 20,000 meals?

00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:46.480
No, that certainly is not the case.

00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:48.480
Think about apples.

00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:52.480
How many varieties of apples have you personally tasted?

00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:54.480
Maybe a couple of dozen.

00:55:54.480 --> 00:56:02.480
Fiji, Gala, Rome, Macintosh, Red and Golden delicious, Granny Smith, Jonathan, Winsap.

00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:05.480
Maybe you've tried a couple of dozen.

00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:13.480
Studies show there are more than 7,500 varieties of apples grown in the earth.

00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:18.480
If you sample one apple every day, it would take you over 20 years.

00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:26.480
Just to sample the varieties that are grown in the earth today, not speaking of ones, new ones that may be developed in the New World, but take you over 20 years.

00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:32.480
And you could go 20 years later, back and eat that first one, you sample.

00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:35.480
It'd be like a brand new variety, wouldn't it?

00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:43.510
Nothing boring about Jehovah's creation.

00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:45.510
Think about this, too.

00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:46.510
Another example.

00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:55.510
If you take a wonderful vacation and a beautiful part of the earth, you go back into the same area, you take another vacation in the summer.

00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:57.510
Are you bored?

00:56:57.510 --> 00:57:01.510
No, repeating pleasurable things are not boring.

00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:06.510
And also, to remember, is that you will never learn it all.

00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:08.510
We will never do it all.

00:57:08.510 --> 00:57:10.510
Learn it or do it all.

00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:13.510
Let's go back to Ecclesiastes, chapter 3.

00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:19.510
And this time, let's read the entire verse, verse number 11.

00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:24.510
He, Jehovah, has made everything beautiful in its time.

00:57:24.510 --> 00:57:28.510
He has even put eternity in their heart.

00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:41.510
Yet mankind, now look at that word, will never, never find out the work that the true God has made from start to finish.

00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:45.510
So, Jehovah says, you'll never learn it all, you'll never do it all.

00:57:45.510 --> 00:57:54.510
How long would it take you to learn to play all the musical instruments that exist today to learn to play them well?

00:57:54.510 --> 00:57:58.510
People spend their whole life learning to play one instrument, don't they?

00:57:58.510 --> 00:58:02.510
When they die, they wish they had more time to develop that skill.

00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:07.510
What about new instruments even invented in the New World?

00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:21.760
You, you brothers, imagine living a hundred years with a beard, a hundred years with just a mustache, a hundred years with a go-t, a hundred years clean shaven.

00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:28.170
Then go back in and repeat that process with different variations.

00:58:28.170 --> 00:58:37.170
Imagine living a hundred years in a beautiful house that you built in the mountains, you and your family, and then trading that house

00:58:37.170 --> 00:58:41.170
with a house that a family built on the seashore.

00:58:41.170 --> 00:58:44.170
And you live in that house for a hundred years.

00:58:44.170 --> 00:58:47.170
And you continue the trading process all around the planet Earth.

00:58:47.170 --> 00:58:55.170
So, finally, you get back to that original house that you built in the mountains, but now it's greatly improved.

00:58:55.170 --> 00:59:00.170
Remodel and beautiful, you live there another hundred years, you start that process.

00:59:00.170 --> 00:59:03.170
Again, I mean, just think about some of these things.

00:59:03.170 --> 00:59:11.170
Imagine learning about all the millions of varieties of fish, amphibians, mammals, birds, insects.

00:59:11.170 --> 00:59:16.480
I read about one man who studied fleas.

00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:20.480
22 years, he spent studying fleas.

00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:25.480
He is a flea expert.

00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:30.480
Probably doesn't know much about anything else, but he knows about fleas.

00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:33.860
22 years.

00:59:33.860 --> 00:59:43.860
Imagine getting to know and appreciate every human among the billions who will be living on the earth,

00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:45.860
getting to know and appreciate every one of them.

00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:52.860
Learning from their talents, their experiences coming to regard them as a dear friend.

00:59:52.860 --> 00:59:53.860
Just one example.

00:59:53.860 --> 01:00:01.860
When you like to spend some time with Noah's wife, I know I'd like to know, what is your name?

01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:05.860
Right now, we know a sister Noah, right?

01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:13.860
And how were you and your husband able to protect your son from the evil influence that was around you?

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:16.860
What was it like in those years before the flood?

01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:18.860
What was it like to come out of the earth?

01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:22.860
You could spend a lot of time with Noah's wife, couldn't you?

01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:32.860
Imagine learning about all, each one of the more than 200 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy.

01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:36.860
And then after you do that, you can go to the next galaxy.

01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:42.860
And they estimate there are more galaxies than there are individual stars in the Milky Way galaxy.

01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:46.860
Now you think of that and it gives you a headache, doesn't it?

01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:50.860
A lot of time could be user even more impossible.

01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:55.860
Imagine learning about Jehovah throughout all eternity.

01:00:55.860 --> 01:01:02.860
We will learn more and more fascinating things about our God and never begin to learn it all.

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:11.860
Well, we could go on and on, but hopefully we could use some of these points if we ever encounter someone who brings up that reasoning,

01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:13.860
is it really possible to live forever?

01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:17.860
It's not only possible, it's guaranteed, isn't it?

01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:21.860
And it definitely will not be boring.

01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:33.860
And hopefully all of us appreciate even more this marvelous prize that Jehovah has invited humans to reach out and take hold of,

01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:40.860
don't miss it, don't miss it, reach out and take hold of the real life.

01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:58.579
As always, you've given us much to think about, Brother Steve.

01:01:58.579 --> 01:02:02.579
Many thought-provoking illustrations as well. Thank you so much.

01:02:02.579 --> 01:02:06.579
At last year's annual meeting, we received a new brochure.

01:02:06.579 --> 01:02:08.579
Love people make disciples.

01:02:08.579 --> 01:02:12.579
And we embraced a new approach to our ministry.

01:02:12.579 --> 01:02:14.579
How's it going for you?

01:02:14.579 --> 01:02:20.579
The following video will share a few experiences related to our new approach to the ministry.

01:02:20.579 --> 01:02:22.579
Let's watch.

01:02:22.579 --> 01:02:37.590
Did I enjoy memorizing presentations?

01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:39.590
No.

01:02:39.590 --> 01:02:45.590
I think I just got used to memorizing presentations. It was something we did since we were kids.

01:02:45.590 --> 01:02:49.590
I found that it was kind of hit or miss in the way that people responded.

01:02:49.590 --> 01:02:54.590
Sometimes they responded well, sometimes they didn't, because maybe that wasn't a subject that interested them.

01:02:54.590 --> 01:03:00.590
When I was feeling kind of unsure, like what to do, I'd probably just bail out with,

01:03:00.590 --> 01:03:02.590
but I don't want to take too much of your time right now.

01:03:02.590 --> 01:03:05.590
And I was nice talking with you and maybe some other time.

01:03:05.590 --> 01:03:11.570
I read and studied the brochure completely.

01:03:11.570 --> 01:03:15.570
Honestly, I felt that I got this. I didn't.

01:03:15.570 --> 01:03:23.570
When we first got this brochure, I was very intimidated because I was so used to the method that we used before.

01:03:23.570 --> 01:03:29.570
I was at the airport and the guy behind me, he's complaining about the heating floor there

01:03:29.570 --> 01:03:33.570
and that the only reason why he was there is because of a funeral.

01:03:33.570 --> 01:03:39.570
I stopped him and I said, excuse me, I overheard you saying that you were here for a funeral.

01:03:39.570 --> 01:03:42.570
Who died? And he said, my mother-in-law.

01:03:42.570 --> 01:03:46.570
Then I remember I have a magazine about comfort for those who grieve.

01:03:46.570 --> 01:03:51.570
And then I pulled the magazine out and the conversation was done.

01:03:51.570 --> 01:03:54.570
In my mind, I said, wow, wow.

01:03:54.570 --> 01:03:56.570
He ain't gonna talk no more.

01:03:56.570 --> 01:03:58.570
He didn't.

01:03:58.570 --> 01:04:08.570
I love our new approach because people can see Jehovah's people as loving, caring, people, not just preachers.

01:04:08.570 --> 01:04:16.570
Because there's no agenda necessarily, you're not trying to leave a specific publication, you feel more relaxed.

01:04:16.570 --> 01:04:19.570
And oftentimes the conversation's naturally gonna go there.

01:04:19.570 --> 01:04:22.570
And sometimes it doesn't lead to opening up to a scripture.

01:04:23.570 --> 01:04:28.570
Just talking about their crazy situation at work or something else going on in their family.

01:04:28.570 --> 01:04:31.570
But it's okay because I made a friend.

01:04:31.570 --> 01:04:36.570
So this lady, I was about to pay and she had these very colorful nails.

01:04:36.570 --> 01:04:39.570
Long colorful decorated nails.

01:04:39.570 --> 01:04:41.570
And it's like she wanted me to say something about her nails.

01:04:41.570 --> 01:04:44.570
She definitely wanted to make a statement with that.

01:04:44.570 --> 01:04:47.570
So I said, girl, your nails look good.

01:04:47.570 --> 01:04:51.570
And she was like, my nails have a meaning.

01:04:51.570 --> 01:04:52.570
And I'm like, they do.

01:04:52.570 --> 01:04:56.570
And she's like, yeah, I want to support domestic violence.

01:04:56.570 --> 01:04:59.570
Domestic awareness month.

01:04:59.570 --> 01:05:01.570
And I'm like, well, you really care about people.

01:05:01.570 --> 01:05:03.570
We went to the website.

01:05:03.570 --> 01:05:04.570
We showed the website.

01:05:04.570 --> 01:05:08.570
And the feature article for that month was literally about domestic abuse.

01:05:08.570 --> 01:05:10.570
And she got to see some Bible principles.

01:05:10.570 --> 01:05:12.570
And she took that with her.

01:05:12.570 --> 01:05:14.570
And we had a good conversation.

01:05:14.570 --> 01:05:16.570
My wife and I were working together in a territory.

01:05:16.570 --> 01:05:18.570
And we were walking back to our cause.

01:05:18.570 --> 01:05:22.570
I saw a man across the street in the block that was already done.

01:05:22.570 --> 01:05:25.570
And we asked him how his week has been going.

01:05:25.570 --> 01:05:28.570
That led to us asking what sort of work he did.

01:05:28.570 --> 01:05:32.570
From that bit of interest, he really appreciated it.

01:05:32.570 --> 01:05:34.570
He loved what we had to say.

01:05:34.570 --> 01:05:37.570
And so he actually just asked out of the blue for a study.

01:05:37.570 --> 01:05:40.570
After we showed him the enjoy life wherever brochure.

01:05:40.570 --> 01:05:44.570
He's attended many meetings and been a good return visit.

01:05:45.570 --> 01:05:50.570
When I entered a shop, I started a conversation with the owner.

01:05:50.570 --> 01:05:54.570
I asked, how long have you been doing this job?

01:05:54.570 --> 01:05:57.570
We talked about a lot of things.

01:05:57.570 --> 01:06:03.570
Then naturally she started expressing how she always had questions about life.

01:06:03.570 --> 01:06:09.570
I then offered a Bible study and she accepted the offer with interest.

01:06:09.570 --> 01:06:14.570
And on, we have been studying each week and about five months have passed.

01:06:14.570 --> 01:06:17.570
But we continue to enjoy the discussions.

01:06:17.570 --> 01:06:21.570
I was walking through a park one day and I saw a family.

01:06:21.570 --> 01:06:24.570
I had a beautiful conversation.

01:06:24.570 --> 01:06:27.570
I asked a few questions and listening to them,

01:06:27.570 --> 01:06:33.570
I was really able to hear the concerns of their heart regarding the future for their daughter.

01:06:33.570 --> 01:06:36.570
I offered a Bible study.

01:06:36.570 --> 01:06:41.570
I've been studying now every week and she attended the convention for the first time this year.

01:06:41.570 --> 01:06:47.539
And she's been attending meetings.

01:06:47.539 --> 01:06:55.539
By us showing them some love, they might feel like they might be worthy of more love than just from us but from their creator.

01:06:55.539 --> 01:07:03.539
This has really helped me to view them as a potential servant of Jehovah as one of my brothers and sisters.

01:07:03.539 --> 01:07:05.539
I don't want to be that obstacle.

01:07:05.539 --> 01:07:13.539
Let me listen, let me be patient, let me, let me be humble and wait to see at the right time.

01:07:13.539 --> 01:07:15.539
But my goal is still the same.

01:07:15.539 --> 01:07:18.539
We're going to talk about my God, Jehovah.

01:07:18.539 --> 01:07:20.539
I just know so fast.

01:07:20.539 --> 01:07:38.190
So may all of us continue to show love for people and continue to try to make disciples.

01:07:38.190 --> 01:07:45.539
Earlier this year we received the soundtrack to last year's convention drama.

01:07:45.539 --> 01:07:48.539
Commit your way to Jehovah.

01:07:48.539 --> 01:07:51.539
Have you found this to be inspiring and encouraging?

01:07:51.539 --> 01:08:08.630
Well, you'll be happy to know that the governing body has approved preparing multiple soundtracks for the good news according to Jesus.

01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:11.630
The...

01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:14.630
Would you like to hear sample?

01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:23.979
Let's listen to some audio excerpts of this soundtrack.

01:08:23.979 --> 01:13:00.579
The music for the good news according to Jesus is very important to the governing body and so we're happy to share these excerpts with you.

01:13:00.579 --> 01:13:09.579
You'll be happy to know that the release of the first soundtrack to GNJ will be in the late spring or early summer of 2025.

01:13:09.579 --> 01:13:14.579
Well, the time has come for the concluding part of our program.

01:13:14.579 --> 01:13:18.579
And it's a special treat.

01:13:18.579 --> 01:13:21.579
That's all I'm going to say.

01:13:21.579 --> 01:13:27.579
Brother David's plane will now give the talk, give Jehovah glory.

01:13:27.579 --> 01:13:39.439
Well, I don't have to tell you that many people today are totally self-absorbed.

01:13:39.439 --> 01:13:50.439
They spend a lot of time on the internet, a lot of time on social media talking about themselves, talking about their own accomplishments.

01:13:50.439 --> 01:13:59.439
And that's in contrast with Jehovah's people because Jehovah's people are concerned with giving God glory.

01:13:59.439 --> 01:14:04.439
And this is in line with what we read at Psalm 96 and verse 8.

01:14:04.439 --> 01:14:14.439
Now this is the only text we're going to read during this talk and I am going to have a look at three words in the phrase that we're going to be reading.

01:14:14.439 --> 01:14:18.439
So please let's look it up. I'll give you a moment to find it.

01:14:18.439 --> 01:14:23.439
If you're like me sometimes it takes a little while to find things in the Bible.

01:14:23.439 --> 01:14:28.439
Psalm 96 and verse 8.

01:14:28.439 --> 01:14:33.439
And it's just the first clause, the first phrase that we're going to look at.

01:14:33.439 --> 01:14:41.439
It says, give Jehovah the glory due his name.

01:14:41.439 --> 01:14:47.439
Give Jehovah the glory due his name.

01:14:47.439 --> 01:14:55.439
Now what were the circumstances during which these words were first spoken?

01:14:55.439 --> 01:15:04.439
They were first spoken on a very happy occasion, a special spiritual occasion.

01:15:04.439 --> 01:15:07.439
They were first spoken, they're part of the song.

01:15:07.439 --> 01:15:16.439
And that song was first composed by David when he was bringing the ark of the covenant back to Jerusalem.

01:15:16.439 --> 01:15:21.439
So you can imagine the joy with which these words were spoken.

01:15:21.439 --> 01:15:31.439
And finally eventually that song became part of the Theocratic song book that the Israelites used when they were praising Jehovah.

01:15:32.439 --> 01:15:37.439
Now we're going to focus on three words in this phrase that I just read.

01:15:37.439 --> 01:15:43.439
Glory due and name.

01:15:43.439 --> 01:15:49.439
Give Jehovah the glory due his name.

01:15:49.439 --> 01:15:56.720
Now when you think of the word glory what comes to your mind?

01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:06.720
If you're like me, you probably think of a blinding light, a light that's so intense that you have to shield your eyes.

01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:14.720
And you might think of the words of the Apostle John when he wrote that God is light.

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:27.000
And so you might ask yourself, how could an imperfect person like me give God glory?

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Well, it all comes together when we appreciate what the scriptures mean by glory.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Now let's be real simple.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Glory in the scriptures means anything that makes someone or something impressive.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.340
I'm going to repeat that.

01:16:51.340 --> 01:17:02.340
In the scriptures, glory means anything that makes someone or something impressive.

01:17:02.340 --> 01:17:11.340
Now with that simple definition in mind we realize that we can ring glory to God in our preaching work.

01:17:11.340 --> 01:17:18.340
Well we tell others how wonderful Jehovah is, how impressive he is.

01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:23.340
We have many reasons to boast in our God.

01:17:23.340 --> 01:17:26.340
Our God is merciful and compassionate.

01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:29.340
Our God is empathetic when we feel hurt.

01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:31.340
He feels hurt.

01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:33.340
Our God is humble.

01:17:33.340 --> 01:17:42.340
He shows concern for widows and orphans and others who are often neglected by society.

01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:47.340
We also bring a glory to Jehovah when we give him credit for our accomplishments.

01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:49.340
David did that.

01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:51.340
Remember what David said?

01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:57.340
By God's power, I can scale a wall.

01:17:57.340 --> 01:18:02.340
But we can give glory to God without saying a word.

01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:04.340
Think of the heavens.

01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:07.340
What does the Bible say about the heavens?

01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:12.340
There is no speech and there are no words.

01:18:12.340 --> 01:18:15.340
Their voice is not heard.

01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:19.340
Yet what does the Psalm continue to say?

01:18:19.340 --> 01:18:23.340
The heavens are declaring the glory of God.

01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:28.340
We can't help but be impressed by Jehovah's creation.

01:18:28.340 --> 01:18:31.340
Well so much for glory.

01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:39.340
Give Jehovah the glory due his name.

01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:44.340
Now we give someone his due when we give him what's rightfully his.

01:18:44.340 --> 01:18:49.340
And Jehovah has an absolute right to receive glory from men.

01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:58.340
We're reminded of what the 24 elders said as recorded at Revelation 4 and verse 11.

01:18:58.340 --> 01:19:04.340
They said, you are worthy Jehovah our God to receive the glory.

01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:11.689
Give Jehovah the glory due his name.

01:19:11.689 --> 01:19:14.689
What about God's name?

01:19:14.689 --> 01:19:18.689
Well we were thrilled when we first learned that God has a name

01:19:18.689 --> 01:19:22.689
and that prompted some of us to study the Bible and come into the truth.

01:19:22.689 --> 01:19:27.689
Now if learning that God has a name had that effect on you,

01:19:27.689 --> 01:19:32.689
don't you think that it could also have that effect on people in your territory?

01:19:32.689 --> 01:19:37.689
Have you asked people in your territory recently what you like to see God's name in the Bible

01:19:37.689 --> 01:19:41.689
or have you ever seen God's name in the Bible?

01:19:41.689 --> 01:19:46.689
That could lead to some very interesting discussions.

01:19:46.689 --> 01:19:50.689
A missionary serving in a country where most of the people believe in God.

01:19:50.689 --> 01:19:53.689
They're either Catholic or Muslim but they all believe in God.

01:19:53.689 --> 01:19:58.689
They don't know much about him but I like the way he reasons with them.

01:19:58.689 --> 01:20:02.689
He says, when you want to become friends with someone,

01:20:02.689 --> 01:20:05.689
the first thing you do is introduce yourself.

01:20:05.689 --> 01:20:09.689
You tell him your name, he tells you his and you become friends.

01:20:09.689 --> 01:20:12.689
But we all want to be friends of God.

01:20:12.689 --> 01:20:21.689
So a good first step is to find out his name and then he reads the God's name in the Bible.

01:20:21.689 --> 01:20:26.689
We give God glory when we defend his name and his reputation.

01:20:26.689 --> 01:20:29.689
But what does the name mean?

01:20:29.689 --> 01:20:34.689
Well many scholars say it means he causes to become.

01:20:34.689 --> 01:20:40.689
And we know that Jehovah can cause us to become whatever he wants to be.

01:20:40.689 --> 01:20:48.689
So think about what we heard earlier in this program today.

01:20:49.689 --> 01:20:55.689
If he wants us to become a missionary, if he wants us to work in construction,

01:20:55.689 --> 01:21:00.689
if he wants us to be a special pioneer or to serve at Bethel,

01:21:00.689 --> 01:21:05.689
that Jehovah can give us the strength, he can give us the ability to do that.

01:21:05.689 --> 01:21:09.689
And all we have to do is put our trust in him.

01:21:09.689 --> 01:21:15.689
Now like the heavens, we can sometimes give God glory without saying a word.

01:21:15.689 --> 01:21:17.689
How?

01:21:17.689 --> 01:21:20.689
By our fine conduct.

01:21:20.689 --> 01:21:26.689
How many unbelievers have come into the truth sometimes after being violently opposed for years

01:21:26.689 --> 01:21:30.689
because of the conduct of their Christian mate and children?

01:21:30.689 --> 01:21:34.689
How many unbelievers have been impressed by the way we take care of one another

01:21:34.689 --> 01:21:38.689
and others when disaster strikes?

01:21:38.689 --> 01:21:42.689
So we think about the words of Jesus and the sermon on the Mount.

01:21:42.689 --> 01:21:51.689
When people see our fine works, they give glory to our Father in heaven.

01:21:51.689 --> 01:21:57.689
Jehovah is also glorified when his servants respond to the leading of his spirit in their Christian life

01:21:57.689 --> 01:22:02.689
when they become more humble, more loving, more trustworthy.

01:22:02.689 --> 01:22:10.689
Now if you're an appointed man, have the elders found you to be more reasonable, more tactful,

01:22:10.689 --> 01:22:13.689
more yielding over the years?

01:22:13.689 --> 01:22:21.689
When they see those changes in us, our brothers and sisters don't fail to give credit to Jehovah God

01:22:21.689 --> 01:22:24.689
and Jehovah God is praised.

01:22:24.689 --> 01:22:32.689
So in 2025, let's give serious thought to ways we can give God glory.

01:22:32.689 --> 01:22:37.689
And to remind us, those words, the words of Psalm 968,

01:22:37.689 --> 01:22:42.689
are going to be posted in our kingdom halls as our ear text.

01:22:42.689 --> 01:22:44.689
So what's the ear text again?

01:22:44.689 --> 01:22:51.689
Psalm 968, give Jehovah the glory, do his name.

01:22:51.689 --> 01:23:13.380
Now there's a poem entitled, Give Jehovah Glory.

01:23:13.380 --> 01:23:17.380
And I'm going to read it to you. We don't usually, we don't do poetry in our publications

01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:19.380
because it's too hard to translate.

01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:22.380
But this is a good one and I'm going to read it to you.

01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:28.420
It's entitled, Give Jehovah Glory.

01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:32.420
Who is like you or Jehovah?

01:23:32.420 --> 01:23:35.420
Hi on your heavenly throne.

01:23:35.420 --> 01:23:41.420
How could I ever repay you for all of the love you have shown?

01:23:41.420 --> 01:23:47.420
When I look up to the heavens, power and glory I see.

01:23:47.420 --> 01:23:55.420
Who then am I, O Jehovah, that you would show favor to me?

01:23:55.420 --> 01:23:58.420
My life is yours, O Jehovah.

01:23:58.420 --> 01:24:01.420
May all I do bring you praise.

01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:06.420
Gladly I'll speak of your goodness and tell of your glorious ways.

01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:13.420
Serving you, great God, Jehovah, fills me with honor and pride.

01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:17.420
You are my strength and my glory.

01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:20.420
Forever may you be my God.

01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:29.420
Oceans and valleys below me, sun, moon and stars up above, fill me with joy and with wonder

01:24:29.420 --> 01:24:32.420
and show me your unending love.

01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:39.420
Majesty, wisdom and beauty, these are the things that I see.

01:24:39.420 --> 01:25:01.560
How could I not give you glory for making it all come to be?

01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:08.560
Those words were composed for a very happy occasion.

01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:11.560
A spiritual occasion.

01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:14.560
They're part of a song.

01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:22.560
An original song that was composed specially for this annual meeting.

01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:26.609
And guess what?

01:25:26.609 --> 01:25:28.609
Guess what?

01:25:28.609 --> 01:25:50.380
We are going to sing that song at the conclusion of this meeting.

01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:53.380
I said to the governing body, are you sure?

01:25:53.380 --> 01:26:01.380
And they said, oh yes, they have tremendous confidence in your musical ability.

01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:07.380
Now, just so you know, the governing body has decided that from now on,

01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:26.350
a new original song based on the Eurotex is going to be featured at each annual meeting.

01:26:26.350 --> 01:26:32.350
The brothers in music services are busy working on the one for 2026.

01:26:32.350 --> 01:26:39.350
Now, during the past two months, the music team and translation services all around the world

01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:45.350
have been working feverishly to translate, record and mix the song.

01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:53.350
And as a result of their efforts, when this talk is released on October the 14th,

01:26:53.350 --> 01:27:02.350
the song will be released simultaneously with the English in over 400 languages.

01:27:17.140 --> 01:27:23.140
So, let's see how those words sound when they're put to music.

01:27:23.140 --> 01:27:27.140
Now, remember, we're going to be singing this song at the conclusion of the meeting.

01:27:27.140 --> 01:27:32.140
And we don't want anybody just moving the lips with no sound coming out.

01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:37.140
There is a reason why we call it a song.

01:27:37.140 --> 01:27:40.140
So pay attention and enjoy.

01:27:40.140 --> 01:27:42.140
Give Jehovah glory.

01:27:42.140 --> 01:32:54.300
You sure are an encouraging group with all this applause.

01:32:54.300 --> 01:32:56.300
You know, that's why we're going over time.

01:32:56.300 --> 01:33:04.939
Well, now, if you're listening in your room, when the time comes to sing,

01:33:04.939 --> 01:33:08.939
be sure to join in. Remember, the Lord is listening.

01:33:08.939 --> 01:33:12.939
So don't think that just because you're in private, that you shouldn't join in.

01:33:12.939 --> 01:33:14.939
Now, we all want to join in.

01:33:14.939 --> 01:33:18.939
And this is a way we can give additional glory to Jehovah.

01:33:18.939 --> 01:33:26.939
So, in 2025, let's pay special attention to ways we can give God glory.

01:33:26.939 --> 01:33:29.939
He certainly is worthy.

01:33:29.939 --> 01:33:42.819
We pray that this program has strengthened your faith and will encourage each one of us

01:33:42.819 --> 01:33:48.819
to remain steadfast in Jehovah's service and having plenty to do in the work of the Lord.

01:33:48.819 --> 01:33:52.819
Be assured that the governing body loves each of you.

01:33:52.819 --> 01:33:59.819
And we're truly interested in your everlasting welfare as one of Jehovah's precious sheep.

01:33:59.819 --> 01:34:04.819
What a joy to share this beautiful program with all of you.

01:34:04.819 --> 01:34:10.819
Let's conclude with this month's video postcard, which takes us to Armenia.

01:34:10.819 --> 01:34:18.819
Armenia lies east of Turkje and south of the Caucasus mountain range.

01:34:18.819 --> 01:34:23.819
Jerevan, its capital and Georgian magnificent view of Mount Ararat,

01:34:23.819 --> 01:34:28.819
where according to tradition Noah's Ark, came to rest.

01:34:28.819 --> 01:34:33.819
Armenia is even more mountainous than Switzerland with deep river valleys,

01:34:33.819 --> 01:34:37.819
forest and extinct volcanoes.

01:34:37.819 --> 01:34:42.819
More than 3,000 plant species thrive in this small country.

01:34:42.819 --> 01:34:47.819
Farms produce a variety of crops, pomegranates, cherries,

01:34:47.819 --> 01:34:51.819
peaches and 50 different types of apricots,

01:34:51.819 --> 01:34:55.819
which are sometimes called Armenian apples.

01:34:55.819 --> 01:35:00.819
Jehovah's witnesses have been active in Armenia since 1975,

01:35:00.819 --> 01:35:04.819
when the country was still part of the Soviet Union.

01:35:04.819 --> 01:35:08.819
For many years, congregation meetings were held in homes,

01:35:08.819 --> 01:35:13.819
and it was not possible to hold assemblies or conventions here.

01:35:14.819 --> 01:35:19.819
But, beginning in 1989, witnesses in Armenia were invited

01:35:19.819 --> 01:35:23.819
to attend international conventions in other countries,

01:35:23.819 --> 01:35:28.819
including this one in Kiev, Ukraine in 1993.

01:35:28.819 --> 01:35:34.819
That same year authorities began imprisoning our brothers for their neutrality.

01:35:34.819 --> 01:35:41.819
Over the next 20 years, more than 500 brothers were sentenced to prison terms

01:35:41.819 --> 01:35:43.819
of up to three years.

01:35:43.819 --> 01:35:49.819
But in 2011, the European Court of Human Rights upheld the right

01:35:49.819 --> 01:35:55.819
to refuse military service based on conscientious objection.

01:35:55.819 --> 01:36:00.819
This was the first time that the court recognized that conscientious objection

01:36:00.819 --> 01:36:04.819
to military service based on one's religious beliefs

01:36:04.819 --> 01:36:10.819
should be protected under the right of freedom of thought, conscience and religion.

01:36:11.819 --> 01:36:17.819
By November 2013, all imprisoned brothers had been released.

01:36:17.819 --> 01:36:27.819
Today, more than 11,000 publishers and 2,480 pioneers surf in Armenia.

01:36:27.819 --> 01:36:37.819
They preached in seven languages, including Persian, Kurdish, Kurmanji, Hindi and Russian sign language.

01:36:37.819 --> 01:36:46.819
On December 7, 1988, an earthquake devastated Armenians' northern region.

01:36:46.819 --> 01:36:53.819
It claimed some 25,000 lives and left half a million people homeless.

01:36:53.819 --> 01:36:58.819
The quake destroyed the town of Spitoch, which has since recovered

01:36:58.819 --> 01:37:02.819
though some evidence of the quake remains.

01:37:02.819 --> 01:37:09.819
Through it all, our brothers and sisters continue diligently to share the good news.

01:37:09.819 --> 01:37:16.819
The 44 publishers and 18 regular pioneers in the Spitoch congregation

01:37:16.819 --> 01:37:20.819
sentenced their warm love and greetings.

01:37:20.819 --> 01:37:27.819
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is J.W. Broadcasting.
