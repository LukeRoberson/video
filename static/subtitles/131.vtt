00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:10.960
Unity. It is often so elusive in political, religious, social, racial, and financial circles.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:17.120
We love the amazing unity that we experience as a global brotherhood. No matter the country,

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:23.800
one's background or former beliefs, it is amazing that around the world we have unity

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.399
of thought.

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:32.740
So speaking hundreds of languages, there is one singular sound or unified message that

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:40.399
is being preached. In fact, Romans 10, 17, and 18 says,

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:47.439
So faith follows the thing heard. In turn, what is heard is through the word about Christ.

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:53.719
But I ask, they did not fail to hear, did they? Why, in fact, into all the earth, their

00:00:53.719 --> 00:01:02.159
sound went out and to the ends of the inhabitor, their message. That is amazing. Millions

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:10.040
believe in exactly the same based on the word about Christ. One singular sound goes out.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:20.079
That is unity of belief. Some may say unity of belief, your brainwashed. Well, we do agree

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:27.439
that our thinking has been washed clean from the complicated doctrines that have evolved

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:34.599
since Jesus walked the earth. However, the unity of mind results from a thorough study

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:41.000
of the Scriptures. It is a matter of learning God's Word and separating His teachings

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.599
out from the many doctrines that have been introduced by human thinking. When a classroom

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:55.359
full of students take a math course like algebra, at the end of the class, no one accuses

00:01:55.359 --> 00:02:02.359
them of being brainwashed when they all end up united in their understanding. They simply

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:10.400
learn the math accurately and put it to use. But it is one thing to be united in thinking

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:17.360
and yet another to be united in spirit as a brotherhood. Going back to a math class,

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.560
at the end of the course, all are united in thought. They learned algebra, but that does

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:30.719
not mean they all like each other. They may have petty rivalry or outright prejudice

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:38.240
against some of their classmates. When we learn the truth from God's Word, we become united,

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:44.240
not only in thinking, but also in spirit with our brothers around the world. Even if

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:50.039
we had deep-seated prejudice in our hearts before studying with Jehovah's Witnesses, it

00:02:50.039 --> 00:03:00.870
begins to melt away when learning the truth. Why is that? You will notice, as we read in Ephesians

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:08.349
chapter 4, that godly qualities are learned and perceived. The bad traits we might have

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:16.830
had before have to be unlearned. And Jehovah's Holy Spirit helps mold our personality to match

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:24.069
more closely the beautiful qualities mentioned here in Ephesians 4. Starting with verse

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:35.629
1, the Apostle Paul says, therefore, I, the prisoner in the Lord, appealed to you to walk

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:41.590
worthily of the calling with which you were called, with all humility and myoness and

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.270
patience, putting up with one another in life, earnestly endeavoring to maintain the oneness

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:53.949
of the Spirit in the anointing bond of peace. One body there is, and one spirit, just as

00:03:53.949 --> 00:04:01.509
you were called to the one hope of your calling. One Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:12.669
and Father of all, who is overall and through all and in all. My that is unity, isn't it?

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:22.149
All of those fine qualities reflect the personality of Jesus, perfect. He was unspoiled by the ingrained

00:04:22.149 --> 00:04:31.870
hatred and prejudices that we may have been exposed to. So is it easy to curb ingrained

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:42.670
prejudices? No, it is not that easy. It would be good if it was, but it isn't. It is a process.

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:49.709
Sometimes we show the right spirit on the outside, but inside we are still struggling to

00:04:49.709 --> 00:04:57.149
cultivate that true unity deep in our heart. Do we have a Bible example that makes clear that

00:04:57.149 --> 00:05:05.389
this is a process that we must work our way through? Yes, there is one. In Galatians chapter 2.

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:13.189
Here is Seifas, who was usually called Peter, though Jewish by birth had learned from Jesus not

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:20.389
to be partial. For many years he has accepted non-Jewish fellow worshippers. He associated with them.

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:30.069
He ate meals together with them, but was there still a residue of prejudice within him? It seems so. His

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:38.629
reactions may have even come as a surprise to Peter himself. Regulation chapter 2 verses 11 through

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:54.540
14. And it says, however, when Seifas came to Antioch, I resisted him face to face because he was

00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:01.980
clearly in the wrong. For before certain men from James arrived, he used to eat with people of

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:09.500
the nations. But when they arrived, he stopped doing this and separated himself, fearing those of

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:16.779
the circumcised class. The rest of the Jews also joined him in putting on this pretense,

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:24.939
so that even Barnabas was led along with them in their pretense. But when I saw that they were not

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:31.899
walking in step with the truth of the good news, I said to Seifas, before them all, if you, though

00:06:31.899 --> 00:06:39.660
your Jew, live as the nations do and not as Jews do, how can you compel people of the nations

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:47.660
to live according to Jewish practice? What happened to Peter? Fear man caused his

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:54.060
former traits of prejudice to resurface, and it was contagious, affecting other Jewish men

00:06:54.139 --> 00:07:02.060
around him. In fact, the verse said, even Barnabas was led along with them. Barnabas was a very

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:10.220
warm hearted, generous person. His name even means son of comfort. If Peter and Barnabas could succumb

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:17.740
to this kind of behavior based on their childhood training, we need to be very careful.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:25.019
For a period of time, it may take a conscious effort on our part to maintain unity with our

00:07:25.019 --> 00:07:35.740
brothers and sisters of varying cultures or races. Was Peter able to fully eradicate any residual

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:46.379
form of prejudice from his being? It seems he was. Turned now to 1 Peter 1. About 10 years after he

00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:54.300
shunned the non-Jewish Christians, Peter was inspired to write these words, verse 22.

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:03.509
Now that you have terrified yourselves by your obedience to the truth with unhypocritical,

00:08:03.509 --> 00:08:12.310
brotherly affection as the result, love one another intensely from the heart. Learning what is

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:18.870
right and then consistently doing what is right is a process. We learn the truth gradually.

00:08:19.509 --> 00:08:27.670
We soon have unity of mind and thinking. However, in time, we purify ourselves. How?

00:08:28.709 --> 00:08:37.909
The verse said by our obedience to the truth. And did you notice Peter says with unhypocritical

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:45.909
brotherly affection, not the way he acted ten years or so earlier, he even said to love one

00:08:45.909 --> 00:08:55.350
another intensely from the heart deep inside. We would have love for all in our brotherhood without

00:08:55.350 --> 00:09:02.710
even a twinge of prejudice. Please turn back to Ephesians chapter 4. How does this process of

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:15.940
changing work? Look at verse 17. So this is what I say and bear witness to in the Lord,

00:09:16.659 --> 00:09:24.259
that you should no longer go on walking just as the nations also walk in the futility of their

00:09:24.259 --> 00:09:33.940
minds. It makes clear that we need to change our thinking, our minds, and what follows this unity

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:42.980
of thinking. Verse 22 through 24, you were taught to put away the old personality that conforms to

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:48.659
your former course of conduct and that is being corrupted according to the deceptive, it's

00:09:48.659 --> 00:09:56.740
deceptive desires. And you should continue to be made new in your dominant mental attitude and

00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:03.539
should put on the new personality that was created according to God's will in true righteousness

00:10:03.539 --> 00:10:12.259
and loyalty. Our very personality changes because of our new dominant mental attitude.

00:10:13.379 --> 00:10:21.860
The beautiful thing is that this process is at work in millions of Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide.

00:10:22.659 --> 00:10:30.340
And even though some of us may still be working on this kind of unity deep inside,

00:10:31.299 --> 00:10:39.379
this love already shows on the outside as we mingle with our brothers from all over the world.

00:10:40.259 --> 00:10:51.139
Psalm 133, verse 1 says it right, how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together

00:10:51.139 --> 00:10:53.860
in unity.
