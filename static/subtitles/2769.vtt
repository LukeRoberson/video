00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:06.030
Our theme this month is Christian neutrality.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:11.029
What it means, what it takes, and why we choose it.

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:16.030
What is your opinion? Where do you stand?

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.030
Can one person make a difference in countering injustice?

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.030
When we hear people discussing political topics,

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.030
we might at first think their conversation is purely philosophical.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:33.030
But when injustice threatens our loved ones, it can seem personal.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.030
We expect that people will be divided over political ideology.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.030
Revelation, chapters 8 through 13, 4 told that in the last days,

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.030
government would be the burning issue among mankind,

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.030
and that people would feel pressured to take sides.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.030
The question each of us needs to ask himself is,

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.030
how do I respond when people debate solutions to serious injustices?

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.030
As Christians, we're most interested in the example of Christ.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.030
Satan was pleased to offer him all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.030
in an exchange for one act of worship.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.030
But Jesus wouldn't accept it.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.030
Neither did he assert that Satan had no authority to make such an offer.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.030
Later, Jesus' own countrymen tried to make him king.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.030
But he rejected that too.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.030
Later still, someone asked him whether it was lawful to pay taxes to the Roman government.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.030
Again, Jesus didn't take sides.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.030
He refused to become a world ruler, a national leader, or a political activist.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.030
Did that mean that Jesus didn't care, that he had no opinion?

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.030
To the contrary, Jesus cared more deeply than we can fathom.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:58.030
And by treating people fairly, Jesus promoted justice at the most fundamental level.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.030
Still, his principal focus was on teaching people about the kingdom of God,

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.030
which would eliminate injustice for all time.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:13.030
So what did Jesus indicate should be our position regarding human governments?

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.030
We learn from Jesus' response to the question about Roman taxation,

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.030
as recorded at Mark 12 verses 15 through 17.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.030
Bring me a denarius to look at.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.030
They brought one.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.030
And he said to them,

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.030
Who is image and inscription is this?

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.030
They said to him, Caesars.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.030
Jesus then said,

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:44.030
Pay back Caesars things to Caesar, but God's things to God.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.030
What are Caesars things?

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:57.030
At Romans chapter 13 verses 1 through 7, the Apostle Paul lists tax, tribute, fear, and honor.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.030
Notice, too, that Jesus said to pay back Caesars things.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.030
What does that imply?

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.030
That Caesar, the ruling authority of the day, had issued valuable things.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:15.030
Coins, for example, thus Caesar had the right to ask for some of those coins back.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.030
This enabled the state to continue rendering necessary services.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.030
Jesus acknowledged that.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.030
On the other hand, our most valuable possessions are grants from God Himself.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.030
Such gifts as our heart, our life, our mind, and our strength.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:38.030
We can't give those things back to Caesar because Caesar didn't grant them to us in the first place.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:45.030
We rightly give those things back to God in the form of our dedication and our love.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:51.030
Regarding our love for God, Jesus said at Mark chapter 12 and verse 30,

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:59.030
You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart, and with your whole soul,

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:05.030
and with your whole mind, and with your whole strength.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:14.030
So the love we give back to God is total, no bodily part, function, capacity, or desire being left out.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:22.029
Those who love God take the side of Jesus, whom Jehovah has appointed as King.
