00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:09.099
I'd like to invite you to take your booklet, examining the Scriptures, and focus on the

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:12.060
second-last sentence in our comment.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.980
There's quite a lot in there.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.980
So that's our November 8th comment, the second-last sentence.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:29.820
It says, able, inoc, Noah, Abraham, and others like them believed in the resurrection of

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:39.619
the dead, and looked forward to life on earth, under God's kingdom, to city having real

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:41.100
foundations.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.979
Well, there's a lot there.

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:51.500
Let's take it apart and see how we can confirm each one of those statements that's made.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:59.380
What about the first statement, able, inoc, Noah, Abraham, and others like them believed

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.859
in the resurrection of the dead?

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.819
Now, that's a pretty strong statement.

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:12.060
We don't see a clear teaching of the resurrection in the book of Genesis.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.859
But just because Genesis doesn't mention it doesn't mean that these faithful men of

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:19.780
old didn't know about the resurrection.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.219
The Apostle Paul tells us that they were all looking forward to a reward, a reward that

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:31.140
they would receive not in their lifetime, but in the future.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.579
And that would require a resurrection.

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:37.379
Now the comment mentions inoc.

00:01:37.379 --> 00:01:38.980
What do we know about him?

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.540
Turn to Hebrews chapter 11, and leave your Bibles open there, please, because we're going

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.260
to be reading several verses in Hebrews 11.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:58.489
Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 5, it says, by faith, inoc was transferred so as not to

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:00.290
see death.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.849
And he was nowhere to be found because God had transferred him.

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:13.250
For before he was transferred, that is, just before he died, he received the witness that

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.330
he had pleased God well.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.569
So at the end of his life, he has told that he has pleased God well, and then what?

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.770
Nor reward?

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.129
That doesn't make sense.

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:31.930
Now the clergy of Christendom don't believe that inoc needed a resurrection because they

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.889
don't believe he died.

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:42.370
They focus on Paul's words that inoc was transferred, and he did not see death.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.930
But the fact is that inoc did die.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.569
How do we know?

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.370
Paul says so.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.490
Look at verse 5, we're talking about inoc.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:02.449
Look at verse 7, he's talking to about Abraham, verse 8, Abraham, verse 11, Sarah.

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:10.250
Now look at verse 13, in faith, all of these died.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.050
Well that would include inoc, wouldn't it?

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.210
So inoc did die.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:20.530
Well when it says he was transferred, does it mean that he went to heaven after he died?

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.129
Well, when was he baptized?

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:28.729
Couldn't get to heaven if he wasn't baptized.

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:30.569
When was Abraham baptized?

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:39.770
Noah, Moses, Jesus said, unless anyone is born of water and spirit, he cannot enter the

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:40.770
kingdom of heaven.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.129
Well, come to think of it, none of these faithful men of old were baptized.

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:49.810
None of them were born of water and spirit, so none of them could get to heaven.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:56.250
So that confirms the second part of our comment when it says that they looked forward to life

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:03.490
on earth, under God's kingdom, because they were not born again.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.530
So they would have life on earth.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:13.129
So we have covered really the first two parts of our comment, the fact that these men

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:21.129
did believe in a resurrection and that they were going to be resurrected to life on earth.

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:25.769
But wait a minute, how do we know that they believed in a resurrection?

00:04:25.769 --> 00:04:31.290
Let's look at verse 13 again, and this time we're going to emphasize a little different

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.139
word.

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:42.939
Verse 13, in faith, in faith, all of these died.

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:48.300
Now what's Paul's definition of faith in the same chapter?

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:55.939
He says that the one who has faith believes that God is the rewarder of those who are earnestly

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:57.500
seeking him.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:03.540
So when Paul says that all of these men died in faith, he means that when they died, they

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:09.300
were looking forward to a reward that God was going to become their rewarder.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.620
Well in order for that to take place, they would have to have a resurrection, wouldn't

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.019
they?

00:05:15.019 --> 00:05:16.500
What about Abraham?

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.660
He believed in the resurrection, although he never saw one.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:26.500
Paul mentions that in verses 17 to 19.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:34.540
Paul says by faith, Abraham, when he was tested as good as offered up Isaac, the man

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:39.740
who gladly received the promises attempted to offer up his only begotten son, although

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:45.139
it had been said to him, what will be called your offspring will be through Isaac.

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:53.819
But he reasoned that God was able to raise him up even from the dead.

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:59.740
He reasoned that God was able to raise him up even from the dead, and he did receive

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.339
him from there in an illustrative way.

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:09.939
But how do we know that Abraham believed in the resurrection?

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:18.259
On what basis can Paul say that Abraham reasoned that God was able to resurrect Isaac?

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:20.740
What would you say?

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.100
The key is in verse 18.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:35.259
God said to Abraham, what will be called your offspring will be through Isaac.

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:40.100
In other words, Abraham's descendants were going to come through Isaac, and at the time

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:46.620
that Abraham attempted to offer Isaac, Isaac didn't have any offspring.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.339
God's word had to come true.

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:52.620
When God said your offspring will be through Isaac, it had to come true.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:07:00.500
And so if God allowed Abraham to go through with the sacrifice, he would have to resurrect

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.779
Isaac because God cannot lie.

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:08.420
Now there's a third part of our comment that we were looking at.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:15.259
And it says that God's kingdom is the city having real foundations.

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:19.540
But since when is a city a kingdom?

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.740
Why do we draw that conclusion?

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:28.259
Well, when you come to Vingavid, even today there are independent nations or kingdoms

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:37.500
that are cities, monaco, Singapore, Gibraltar, Vatican City.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:43.740
But go further in Bible times, a lot of cities were kingdoms.

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:48.899
We read about the king of Salem, the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah.

00:07:48.899 --> 00:07:51.939
These were cities, but the cities had kings.

00:07:51.939 --> 00:07:57.220
So Paul's listeners or readers would have understood when he says they were awaiting the

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:01.339
city having real foundation that this was a kingdom.

00:08:01.339 --> 00:08:07.180
Now, Paul makes another powerful point in verse 35 when we talk about whether these faithful

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.980
men of old knew about the resurrection or not.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:18.939
In verse 35, he says, women received their dead by resurrection, but other men were tortured

00:08:18.939 --> 00:08:25.339
because they would not accept release by some ransom in order that they might attain

00:08:25.339 --> 00:08:28.540
a better resurrection.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.139
That makes sense, doesn't it?

00:08:30.139 --> 00:08:37.139
Why would anybody accept to be tortured to death if he didn't believe in a better life?

00:08:37.139 --> 00:08:42.460
So these men accepted to be persecuted and tortured because they knew that something

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:47.779
else, something better was coming, and that would require a resurrection.

00:08:47.779 --> 00:08:53.779
So we can hardly agree with all of the points that are made in this second last sentence

00:08:53.779 --> 00:08:55.539
of our comment today.

00:08:55.539 --> 00:09:03.860
Abel, Inak, Noah, Abraham, and others like them believed in the resurrection of the dead

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:10.659
and looked forward to life on earth under God's kingdom, the city having real foundations.
