WEBVTT

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:10.570
We have 2500 delegates coming in for us. We want to give them our absolute best.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.070
What we want them to feel is the love of the true brotherhood.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.070
The commission was to make it a life-changing experience.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.070
In order to do that, we thought we had to put together more than just come and have some dinner with us.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.070
Overwhelming. I don't know how to express how I feel.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.070
We had, first of all, come up and create the axe.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.070
So I went in the room for two days cried and prayed.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:41.070
But this is where the trust that Johova is directing this through his organization has helped us.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.070
There was so much more involved in showing hospitality to our delegates than we originally thought.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:53.070
We have an original authentic 1892 Chuck Wagon, real Texas Cowboys, real horse trainers,

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.070
open lessons and Texas long horns.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.070
We're making buttermilk biscuits just like they did on the trail in a Dutch oven and coals.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.069
And we have four different casts that we're using, each somewhere in the range of 80, 90 per cast.

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:11.069
Three different locations we're going to be performing at.

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:14.069
This spans over four days.

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:18.069
The evening programs include providing some food to the friends that are here,

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:22.069
some spiritual entertainment with music, some interviews, some videos.

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:26.069
We haven't had field service part of our conventions as in the past.

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:29.069
However, it's so apparent to Johova's behind this.

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:35.069
The example set by the slave, it's so evident this should be done.

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:41.069
They're facing similar challenges in the ministry, but they're still working hard while dealing with these challenges.

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:47.069
Hearing that was very encouraging and it gave me the renewed motivation to keep preaching with zeal.

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:52.069
We also need to volunteer to come to the assembly hall and greet the delegates as they came in off the buses.

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:58.069
At first I wasn't sure why there were many people outside when I saw them from the bus.

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:02.069
When I found out that they were there to welcome us, it put me to tears.

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:08.069
When we found out that the tours were coming to the assembly hall, we knew that we were going to have an extra special blessing.

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.069
We had well over 3,600 volunteers and probably more like 5,000 that were willing to help.

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:19.069
We contacted probably a little bit over 200 congregations to participate in these activities.

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.069
We were from Cheyenne, Wyoming about 850 miles away.

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:31.069
We started about two or three weeks ago getting all the wagons ready and it took a couple of days to get here.

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.069
One of the things I had to do was ask permission on my job.

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:44.069
As for a week off in order to be here, I prayed a lot to Johova and through him they gave me permission and I was able to be here.

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:53.069
I'm so energized and pumped and I really just see us walking into the new world and feeling all of this every day.

00:02:53.069 --> 00:03:02.069
My job has been to come up with drawings and paintings of note cards of things that are indigenous to Washington.

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:09.069
I had the privilege of designing the logo that went on the gift bags for the International Convention.

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.069
We were going to sing for the delegates.

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:18.069
I want to sing for the delegates because I want to make God happy and the delegates too.

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:26.069
The singing at the airport is what's touching to see them waiting for us right at the night because we arrived around 10pm.

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:36.069
I think that they'll be happy to see all of us welcoming them, the things that we're preparing for them, something to take back with them to remember this opportunity that they had.

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:47.069
This part, the top part, the large JW was actually from the messenger which was back in 1931, the International Convention in Columbus, Ohio.

00:03:47.069 --> 00:04:00.069
As you see with all the brothers and sisters, everyone wanting to contribute, everyone wanting to have a part, everyone wanting to be cold, everyone wanting to participate in whatever way they can.

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:02.069
Welcome to Seattle!

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:08.069
Just seeing it being used and enjoyed by the delegates, it was a great feeling.

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:18.069
I was a little bit tired from the flight, but when you saw the smiles and the cheers and the big banners and all the gifts, it was just like, oh my goodness.

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:21.069
You felt it, didn't you? You felt it, you felt it straight away.

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:31.069
We don't know where they're from, we don't know their names, but they just smile and wave and seeing that unity, I mean it's genuine love and you almost want to just cry.

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:41.069
We want them to know that they have brothers here that will support them, who love them, and are willing to do whatever we can to make them enjoy their stay here.

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:46.069
We just want them to feel like our arms have been around them the whole time they've been here.

00:04:46.069 --> 00:05:00.069
It really shows that your home is behind the work, but it also shows the loving brotherhood, because it's so evident by what you see with all the happy faces, the zeal, the enthusiasm, everything that is being spent is all so that we can praise your home.

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:06.069
It's all over, but also to welcome his sheep, the delegates coming from all the different parts of the world.

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:12.069
I hope two, three thousand years from now somebody walks up to me and you go, I remember you, you were at the Cowboy Deal in Texas.

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:18.069
That to me would be fantastic. I know Cowboys aren't supposed to cry, but trust us, we do what it comes to this.

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:22.069
I'm so happy, it moves me to tears.

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:27.069
They came here to let us sing and they watched us, so they took our song with them.

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:30.069
We wanted delegates to be happy.
