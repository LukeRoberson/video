00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:13.259
I grew up underground and travelled in Celetia and at that time I visited the family with

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.460
copies of the watchtower.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:25.500
They catched me and arrested me in Dresden and they were the same strong interrogation

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.500
and Jehovah held me in a wonderful way.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.100
I was surprised by myself what kind of thoughts came in my mind.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:43.700
When they asked me, did you know that the organization of the watchtower is forbidden

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.700
by the government?

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:54.820
I was saying, sure, I noted, why you were working underground against our command?

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:03.140
When I was saying the German judgment, they acknowledged the command, you have not

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.700
to steal, not to lie, not to murder, and this came from the mosaic law, it's from the

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.700
Bible.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.859
If you acknowledged this command, then you have to acknowledge the other command too,

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:22.219
the Bible is saying you have to watch to come together and to encourage one another.

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:28.060
How can I do it if I would be ashamed to met them?

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.219
I want to do the will of God.

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:38.099
This is a command, the church was saying nothing, he spoke with it, besides church, but

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:39.459
he gave no answer.

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:47.700
I was sentenced at first five years and later on, they go down to three in the half

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:58.700
years, because I was so young, I was 25 years of age, so I start my solitary confinement,

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.780
but Jehovah's spirit made me a real joyful.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:15.219
Every day I was thinking, now I have to make every day a special object to think about.

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:24.099
In fact, I want to think about the quality of Jehovah, I start with them, and so I put

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:30.340
my finger in there here and was running too and too and too and too, I want nothing

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:38.099
to hear outside, so wonderful thought and I was happy.

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:45.699
When that was over, then I start what is hope, what is faith.

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:55.259
I start to think about the fruits of spirit, you have a lot of, then I have so much to think

00:02:55.259 --> 00:03:00.939
and the time runs after three in the half years.

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:07.900
The Gestapo called me again and gave me declaration, I have to sign that I never

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.780
want to be in connection with the Jehovah's witnesses and that I refuse to learn more

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:23.780
from the Bible, and I say, no, never, he said, you can think overnight, no, I want not

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:30.500
to think overnight, and immediately I say, never, I will do it, never, I will understand

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.500
it.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.699
And then he was saying, then you have to take the consequences, you will come transferred

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:42.860
to the concentration camp, to the ratten spirit.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:49.219
And when I came and they ordered, I have to put all my dress out to give them away and

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:59.860
then I have to stay with other prisoners, several hours in a big bathroom and we have to

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.580
wait till the doctor will see us.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:13.500
And then it was so humiliating, they want to humiliate, and they want to make a down,

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:20.339
and the old women, between the young girls, they were so strong, ashamed, you saw it,

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:34.790
how they suffered, I never will forget it.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:43.430
And after we get the new dress from the camp, and we were assigned to go to the panicked

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.230
barrack.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:55.709
And then that was terrible night, so many prisoners, they were crying, denied, and other women,

00:04:55.709 --> 00:05:02.829
with whom we have to vomit, and it was a terrible night.

00:05:02.829 --> 00:05:07.430
In the next day, we have to go for rocking.

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.709
We had so strong to work, from morning in summer time, from 5 o'clock, we were in the

00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:18.079
roll call place, till evening, they were not locked.

00:05:18.079 --> 00:05:26.480
Then the quarantine came, we have no to go out, they closed the door, they give us a meal

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:32.079
by a through the window, and we have fine time to have rest.

00:05:32.079 --> 00:05:39.519
We encouraged one another with spiritual interest, and the doctor came knock the window,

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:43.079
who died in your barrack, nobody.

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:52.439
No one, our old weak sisters, they overcome all, never, somewhere, became sick.

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:59.959
So it was real, a good witness for the other in the camp.

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:05.920
My husband was in the concentration camp at first in Dachau, and later on in Mauthausen.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.279
They worked in a stone quarry.

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:16.720
And in that group, a brother had to bat shoes, they were too tight for him, and he took

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:25.160
them out, and he had forgotten to take them, and from the stone quarry to the camp.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.720
And my husband wanted to help him, and he was running to pick up the shoes.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:37.319
And the watchman observed that he ran away from the group.

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:43.000
His punishment was to hang for one hour on the pale.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.800
When I asked my husband, how did you overcome such a tauter?

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:59.879
Then he said, I was thinking, how was the situation when Abraham had to kill his son?

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:05.879
And this was a long way I was all right thinking, what was his thoughts?

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:12.279
How had he overcome his feeling and what Jehovah wants for him?

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:20.920
And then this way, he didn't feel anymore after one hour, when he came down, the other

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:27.720
brothers were saying, you don't look as you have been on the tauter thing.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:34.160
So Jehovah can help us in all such situations.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:39.480
Every situation had some, what was not so easy.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:44.959
But in every situation, we have a touch of wonderful help.

00:07:44.959 --> 00:07:48.759
Jehovah's spirit, and we could pray.

00:07:48.759 --> 00:07:53.079
Jehovah's name is the most important part in our life.

00:07:53.079 --> 00:07:56.240
Nothing is so important like Jehovah's name.
