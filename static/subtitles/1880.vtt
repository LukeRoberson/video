WEBVTT

00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:07.179
In the face of this pandemic, we've made dramatic adjustments to our activities all over

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:15.740
the world, including how we meet, how we preach, and even how we associate with one another.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:22.179
We've even had to make adjustments to the adjustments with changing conditions.

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:27.859
As you know, some of these changes have come very quickly, and we want to commend you

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.940
for your obedience to theocratic direction.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:38.460
We love you all very much and want to keep you safe while helping you to maintain a good

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.700
spiritual routine.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.979
As we think about what happens next, it's important to remember that we're not all experiencing

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:51.539
this global crisis the same way.

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.700
In some parts of the world, the coronavirus is beginning to spread more quickly.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:04.420
In other places, outbreaks appear to be somewhat contained for now, and governments are already

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.260
easing restrictions.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.019
So how will this affect our theocratic activities?

00:01:12.019 --> 00:01:20.019
Well, as things open up in various regions, we're going to be guided by the principle

00:01:20.019 --> 00:01:30.739
in Proverbs 14, verse 16, Proverbs 14, and verse 16, where it says,

00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:39.060
the wise one is cautious and turns away from evil, but the stupid one is reckless and

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.060
overconfident.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:49.939
In this pandemic, recklessness and overconfidence have literally cost people their lives.

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:55.620
But as the Proverbs says, the wise one is cautious.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.379
So we'll continue to take a cautious approach.

00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:05.780
In general, we'll allow more time after governments loosen up a particular restriction before we

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.340
resume a theocratic activity.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.020
This will allow the organization to monitor the impact that any lifting of restrictions

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.500
has on the spread of the virus.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.419
The coordinators committee of the governing body recently shared some valuable principles

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:32.819
with branch committees around the world to help guide them as governments ease restrictions

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.780
related to the spread of COVID-19.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.020
We'd like to share three of those points with you now.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:47.129
We're confident that obediently holding to these principles will not only save

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.849
lives, but glorify Jehovah.

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:59.610
First, out of respect for our creator, we place a high value on life.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:08.650
Some governments may choose to lift restrictions and reopen businesses in part for economic reasons.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:16.849
But simply put, our decisions are motivated by love, not money.

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:23.889
So we'll continue to make the safety of our brothers a priority over personal convenience

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:26.610
or preference.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:35.689
Ecclesiastes 712 says this, Ecclesiastes 712, wisdom is a protection.

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:38.330
Just as money is a protection.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:46.129
But the advantage of knowledge is this, wisdom preserves the life of its owner.

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:53.330
So in harmony with that, our aim has been and will continue to be to make wise, balanced

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.090
decisions that protect lives.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.849
As an example, back in March, we made the decisions who hold the Gilead graduation with

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.090
no invited guest present.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.250
That was a big change.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.050
But that one decision protected so many lives here at Bethel in New York and among those

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.170
who would have been guests.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:21.689
Little did we know that just a short time later, New York would become an epicenter of

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:24.050
the pandemic.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:30.730
We thanked Jehovah for helping us to make that wise decision.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.209
What's the lesson?

00:04:33.209 --> 00:04:38.689
Because we place a high value on life, we need to follow direction.

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:46.850
Even if it seems overly cautious or means significant changes in our theocratic activities.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:52.449
That obedience will help to keep all of us as safe as possible.

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:57.769
In the following video, note how this is proved to be the case for the brothers in South

00:04:57.769 --> 00:05:05.050
America, where the outbreak of COVID-19 cases has surged in recent weeks.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.689
We'll hear from brother Anthony Carvalo, who serves on the Brazil branch committee, and

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:15.370
from brother Jaime Tamayo, who serves on the Ecuador branch committee.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.329
Their reports show the benefits of obedience.

00:05:19.329 --> 00:05:25.740
Even if at first we don't understand the reasons for the direction.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:31.899
The outbreak of COVID-19 has already taken tens of thousands of lives in Brazil.

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:36.180
So we've come to appreciate how the early direction we received from the organization

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.180
was a real protection.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.420
One example is a sister who is a medical doctor.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.220
She said that when the branch office gave direction to suspend meetings at the Kingdom

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.459
Hall, she honestly did not agree.

00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:54.860
There weren't any confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the region, and the local government had

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.740
not ordered any restrictions.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.300
So she felt the brothers might be exaggerating the threat a bit.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.220
But then she reasoned on how Jehovah has sometimes given his people direction that didn't

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:12.660
make sense from a human standpoint, and so she decided to obey.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:18.819
Well, shortly after congregation meetings were suspended, the government put restrictions

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:20.420
in place.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:27.699
COVID-19 began to spread rapidly in the region, and sadly, many have died.

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:33.500
Our sister said that she now sees a direction from the organization was a real protection.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.459
She related.

00:06:35.459 --> 00:06:41.139
Seeing how Jehovah is caring for us in a loving and tender way, even on an individual level,

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:45.019
has increased my confidence in him.

00:06:45.019 --> 00:06:50.180
While this is just one example of many here in Brazil, we have truly seen the benefits

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.379
of obediently following theocratic direction.

00:06:56.269 --> 00:07:01.670
There is no question that the early direction we received in Ecuador saved lives.

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:08.149
For instance, one publisher Fabrizio started to have some flu-like symptoms by his doctor

00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:12.790
told him that he was the common flu and not COVID-19.

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:18.589
Still, Fabrizio followed instructions from the organization to stay home if you have

00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:20.790
any symptoms of illness.

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:27.509
Later, he said, all in a family agreed that it was important to follow these instructions

00:07:27.509 --> 00:07:30.629
since they were given to protect us.

00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:36.870
During the following weeks, he and his family didn't allow anyone into the house.

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:42.509
Even when relatives came to visit them, they received them outside the house to maintain

00:07:42.509 --> 00:07:44.829
a safe distance.

00:07:44.829 --> 00:07:49.230
Around the same time, meetings at a kingdom hall were suspended.

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:56.910
Well, several weeks later, Fabrizio tested positive for COVID-19 and saw these three family

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:57.910
members.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:04.949
Fabrizio's family is so glad that they followed instructions received from the organization.

00:08:04.949 --> 00:08:12.230
They maintained distance in protocols, even without a positive diagnosis of COVID-19.

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:18.589
These protected the lives of others, including their extended family and the congregation.

00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:23.750
Fabrizio really helped us appreciate the wisdom of suspending the creation meetings when

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:24.750
we did.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:32.279
Doing so prevented the spread of the disease to others.

00:08:32.279 --> 00:08:41.639
What a powerful example of how our obedience to direction is a protection and a blessing.

00:08:41.639 --> 00:08:46.759
Our second principle is based on Romans 13, verses 1 and 2.

00:08:46.759 --> 00:08:52.600
We must listen to the governmental superior authorities who are permitted by Jehovah to

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.360
care for certain functions.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:02.919
The importance of listening to these authorities is emphasized in verse 2 where it says, whoever

00:09:02.919 --> 00:09:09.139
opposes the authority or, according to the footnote, whoever resists the authority has

00:09:09.139 --> 00:09:14.610
taken a stand against the arrangement of God.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:20.549
We know that these authorities exist by God's permission, and it's His will that Christians

00:09:20.549 --> 00:09:28.289
be subject to them, as long as what they require doesn't conflict with His law.

00:09:28.289 --> 00:09:33.009
News reports are filled with stories of people ignoring the direction from the authorities

00:09:33.009 --> 00:09:36.570
or even protesting against it.

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:44.289
But rebelling against secular authorities constitutes a rebellion against God.

00:09:44.289 --> 00:09:50.730
We loved Jehovah, so we respect the authorities.

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:55.529
We also listen to the authorities because we love our neighbors, and we're concerned

00:09:55.529 --> 00:09:59.889
with how they feel about health and safety.

00:09:59.889 --> 00:10:06.490
We know that many people out of concern for possible infection are anxious about interacting

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:09.009
with others.

00:10:09.009 --> 00:10:13.730
Following safety guidelines from the authorities and adjusting our activities shows that

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:17.730
we really care about our neighbors.

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:22.129
And this can even contribute to a good witness being given.

00:10:22.129 --> 00:10:24.769
Here's an example of that.

00:10:24.769 --> 00:10:31.049
In one European country, local officials visited our branch office to check on what we were

00:10:31.049 --> 00:10:35.169
doing to slow the spread of the virus.

00:10:35.169 --> 00:10:40.330
When the officials learned that we were holding all our meetings by video conference and had

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:45.769
already been locked down for over two weeks, they were amazed.

00:10:45.769 --> 00:10:52.570
One of them asked, did you know beforehand that all of this would happen?

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:58.809
The brothers explained that we're a global organization that puts a high value on human

00:10:58.809 --> 00:11:05.370
life, so we were following developments on an international level.

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:11.409
We've enabled the brothers to take the steps needed to keep everyone as safe as possible,

00:11:11.409 --> 00:11:16.929
even ahead of guidelines from the national and local governments.

00:11:16.929 --> 00:11:20.740
The officials were impressed.

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:28.659
It doesn't that beautifully illustrate how our obedience reflects favorably on our organization

00:11:28.659 --> 00:11:31.019
and our God.

00:11:31.019 --> 00:11:35.980
It brings to mind the thought at 1 Peter 212.

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:45.710
When people become eyewitnesses of our fine conduct, it brings glory to Jehovah.

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:55.470
The third principle we want to share is this, do not develop a casual attitude.

00:11:55.470 --> 00:12:03.669
As this situation stretches on month after month, it can be hard to stay vigilant.

00:12:03.669 --> 00:12:11.789
We might be inclined to relax, lower our guard, especially as certain restrictions are removed.

00:12:11.789 --> 00:12:22.230
However, Proverbs 22 reminds us, the shrewd one sees the danger and conceals himself, but

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:28.629
the inexperience keeps right on going and suffer the consequences.

00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:34.029
So we need to remain cautious and be ready for additional outbreaks.

00:12:34.029 --> 00:12:39.269
Many experts say we may be dealing with the spread of this virus for some time until

00:12:39.269 --> 00:12:47.549
the successful treatments and vaccinations become widely available, possibly in 2021 or

00:12:47.549 --> 00:12:49.909
beyond.

00:12:49.909 --> 00:12:55.409
This means that the adjusted arrangements we have in place for congregation meetings,

00:12:55.409 --> 00:13:03.830
assemblies, and the field ministry may need to continue for some time.

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:11.029
When we do begin returning to our normal arrangements, it will be a gradual process, in accord with

00:13:11.029 --> 00:13:16.590
what we read in Proverbs 14 and verse 15.

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:25.470
The naïve person believes every word, but the shrewd one ponders each step.

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:32.389
You can be assured that we will prayerfully ponder each step and adjust our meeting and

00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:36.269
service arrangements gradually.

00:13:36.269 --> 00:13:43.789
And of course, we'll monitor this situation closely and reinstate certain restrictions

00:13:43.789 --> 00:13:47.710
if additional outbreaks occur.

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:56.029
So as you face the days ahead, keep in mind the three principles we've talked about.

00:13:56.029 --> 00:14:01.470
One, place a high value on life.

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:05.789
Two, listen to the authorities.

00:14:05.789 --> 00:14:13.629
And three, guard against developing a casual attitude.

00:14:13.629 --> 00:14:18.590
We know that this pandemic has hit some of you very hard.

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:22.029
You've lost jobs and income.

00:14:22.029 --> 00:14:28.789
You young ones have had your schooling interrupted and been able to be with your friends.

00:14:28.789 --> 00:14:38.409
And tragically, a number of you have lost family members and friends in death.

00:14:38.409 --> 00:14:46.250
Some of you may feel like Joe, who faced one tragedy after another.

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:51.769
It pains our hearts to see what you're going through.

00:14:51.769 --> 00:14:57.090
And we're praying for you every day.

00:14:57.090 --> 00:15:00.169
It's been a difficult time.

00:15:00.169 --> 00:15:08.090
Yet in many ways, all of this has been training for the Great Tribulation ahead.

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:15.090
What we're learning now about how to adapt our spiritual routines to support one another

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:23.210
and to be obedient to direction is building us up and equipping us for even bigger challenges

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:26.759
in the future.

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:32.480
It's been very encouraging to hear how our brothers around the world are helping one another

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:37.279
during this unique time in human history.

00:15:37.279 --> 00:15:45.379
Our actions are bringing honor and praise to Jehovah.

00:15:45.379 --> 00:15:51.860
Our brothers and sisters from Brazil and Ecuador send you their warm greetings.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:58.820
And on behalf of the governing body, we thank you for all you're doing, even under these

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.860
difficult circumstances.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:08.299
Please know that we love you very much.

00:16:08.299 --> 00:16:14.379
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.
