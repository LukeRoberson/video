00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:06.240
Jesus compared our days with the days of Noah.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.000
Jesus would know because he was in heaven and watched the days of Noah go from bad to worse.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.179
How bad were the days of Noah?

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:22.629
Let's look at Genesis chapter 6 and verse 5 for a description.

00:00:22.629 --> 00:00:27.969
Consequently, Jehovah saw that man's wickedness was great on the earth

00:00:27.969 --> 00:00:36.310
and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only bad all the time.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.950
The wickedness on the earth was made worse by wicked angels that abandoned their role in heaven

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.250
and materialized human bodies to marry women on earth.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.500
These unholy marriages produced sons that were giants called Nephilim.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.399
Now parents, you imagine what it must have been like for Noah and his wife

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:03.299
to raise a family in that ungodly world.

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:06.340
But you don't really need to imagine it, do you?

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.780
Just one look around us and we can all see that we live in a world that fits the same description

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.959
if not worse than the days of Noah.

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:21.599
Just as Noah's faith was tested, your faith will likely be tested too

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:26.859
as you raise a family in this ungodly world.

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:32.540
Please do not allow the pressures at work from relatives or others.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:40.019
Make you think the material things are more important than your family's relationship with Jehovah.

00:01:40.019 --> 00:01:47.180
You can remain faithful by imitating Noah, not his neighbors.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:57.909
In the following dramatization, note how a parent's faith is tested.

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:06.390
Another busy day, my daughter's going to preach, I'm off to work and it's family worship night.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.949
Bye dad. Have a good day sweetie.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:20.530
Alright let's end up. I got an announcement for everybody.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.599
What? More required over time?

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.400
Let's get back to work.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:48.800
It's extra money, but how can I do it and take care of Regina?

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.110
Isn't it a family worship night?

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:58.659
Maybe a little later sweetie.

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:05.039
I wanted to, but I was spent again.

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:08.400
Our brother knew it was family worship night,

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.840
but extra work, the pressures of life were dragging him down.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.319
His faith was being tested.

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.599
Would he imitate Noah or his neighbors?

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.360
Noah's neighbors lacked faith.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.520
They did not do what was needed to save their families.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.960
Instead Jesus said they were so distracted by their daily lives,

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.599
eating and drinking, getting married,

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:37.719
that they took no note until the flood came and took them all away.

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:41.680
In contrast Noah took note.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.360
Noah acted in faith to save his household.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:53.379
Look at the beautiful description of Noah's faith in Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 7.

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:59.099
By faith Noah, after receiving divine warning of things not yet seen,

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:04.219
showed godly fear and constructed an ark for the saving of his household.

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:07.819
And through this faith he condemned the world

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:16.189
and he became an heir of the righteousness that results from faith.

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:20.149
Noah's actions saved his household.

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:24.990
We can be sure it was not always easy for Noah to explain to his sons

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:28.629
why they were building an ark and no one else was,

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:33.790
or why building it was more important than anything else they had to do.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.189
His three boys would have seen the Nephilim.

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:41.470
Noah and his wife could hardly have shielded their boys from all the stories

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.670
that circulated about those giants.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:50.149
Imagine some of the discussions that Noah and his wife had with their boys.

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:55.069
The materialized wicked angels and their Nephilim sons were men of fame

00:04:55.069 --> 00:05:00.670
and admired by everyone for their superhuman capabilities.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:08.470
Even today people are fascinated with stories and movies of humans with superpowers.

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:16.589
But those wicked angels and their sons the Nephilim were nothing to be admired or imitated.

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:21.350
Noah taught his sons not to admire or copy them.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:28.189
They had to help their boys see that Jehovah felt hurt by the violence and rebellion in the world.

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:34.519
The boys needed to learn to love Jehovah and imitate him.

00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:40.240
Parents, take the time to teach your children to hate what Jehovah hates

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.920
and to love what Jehovah loves.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:49.720
Jehovah hates liars, cheaters, bullies, selfishness and greed.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:58.610
On the other hand, Jehovah loves honesty, peace, love, sharing and self-control.

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:06.569
Noah, like any good father, wanted to make sure his family had a comfortable place to live and good food to eat.

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:10.730
Think of the houses that Noah and his sons could have built from themselves.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.009
They certainly had the construction experience.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.730
But that was not Noah's focus.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:25.149
Noah's life had more meaning and purpose than building houses, eating and drinking.

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:35.160
Noah taught by example and kept his focus on saving his household from the coming flood.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:42.920
He likely had at times when he felt tired or overwhelmed with the sheer size and scope of building an ark.

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:49.480
However, Noah did not allow his day-to-day life to crowd out his service to Jehovah.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.399
He made sure that no matter what else was happening in his life,

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:58.649
that the work of building the ark kept moving forward.

00:06:58.649 --> 00:07:05.529
Our brother we saw in the video, he was tired and overwhelmed by his work and job.

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:08.449
All of us can identify with how he feels.

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:12.329
Life in this system is hard.

00:07:12.329 --> 00:07:22.449
We appreciate the hard work and effort that you parents are making to keep a good spiritual routine for your family.

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:31.290
We know how tempting it can be to say, well, we'll study later, or we'll pick it up again next week.

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:34.290
See the danger.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:45.269
Putting off our spiritual routine this week can easily lead to three weeks and then six weeks and then not at all.

00:07:45.269 --> 00:07:50.110
Jehovah took care of Noah and his family's material needs.

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:54.189
So you can be confident that Jehovah will take care of you and your family.

00:07:54.189 --> 00:07:58.029
He will bless you for your obedience.

00:07:58.029 --> 00:08:07.290
In the following dramatization, note how our brother imitates Noah's faith.

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:09.649
The world is such a mess.

00:08:09.649 --> 00:08:13.649
It's everything Jesus said it would be.

00:08:13.649 --> 00:08:20.060
She's so good, spiritually minded like her mother was.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:09:14.440
Can I expect she'll stay that way on her own?

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:26.039
If it is just like Noah's day, I need to show faith like he did.

00:09:26.039 --> 00:09:30.950
Let's do our family worship.

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:43.059
I need to show faith in Jehovah and work hard to save my family.

00:09:43.059 --> 00:09:48.500
Did you notice how our brother acted in faith?

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:58.340
Our brother imagined what could happen to his daughter if she lost her spirituality and adopted the lifestyle of the world.

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:01.179
What he saw really scared him.

00:10:01.179 --> 00:10:08.720
He immediately turned off the TV and joined his daughter for family worship.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:14.039
Noah knew that building the ark would save his family from the coming flood.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.840
But only if they were in the ark with him.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:24.080
He did not want to see his sons adopt the lifestyle of his neighbors.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:33.279
Noah did everything he could to make sure that he taught his sons to love Jehovah by his words and his actions.

00:10:33.279 --> 00:10:43.039
Parents, by imitating Noah, you can save both yourself and your family.

00:10:43.039 --> 00:10:55.879
Brother Seth Hyatt, a helper with the service committee, will now consider the next talk of this symposium, imitate the faithful, not the faithless, Moses, not Pharaoh.
