00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:09.019
I grew up in a small town, and I had a good childhood.

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.019
My parents instilled in me from a young age,

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.019
a love for God, and a respect for the Bible.

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:21.019
We were regular church attenders, and I went to a private school,

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:25.019
and I had Bible classes each and every day.

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.019
Despite all of this, however, I felt like something was missing.

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.020
When I was 15, my life changed in a moment's notice.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.020
I was playing high up in a tree, the branch broke.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.020
I fell to the ground, and I was paralyzed.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.020
At that moment, I went from an active kid who could run

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.020
to one who was paralyzed from his neck down.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.020
I couldn't feel anything.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.020
By the time I was 18, I gained enough physical strength

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.019
in my arms that I once again had my independence.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.019
At that point, I attended a university and lived on campus.

00:01:10.019 --> 00:01:14.019
My life changed dramatically once again.

00:01:14.019 --> 00:01:19.019
Here I was exposed to drugs, alcohol, immorality,

00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:23.019
and I fell into that lifestyle.

00:01:23.019 --> 00:01:27.019
Every night, though, I still read the Bible.

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:31.019
I still had this strong faith in God.

00:01:31.019 --> 00:01:36.019
But when I prayed and went to sleep at night, I just knew.

00:01:36.019 --> 00:01:40.019
I was going to end up in that hellfire that I had been taught

00:01:40.019 --> 00:01:44.060
from an early age.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.060
During this time, I met a girl named Julie,

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.060
and we were married shortly after.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.060
She was in the same hippie lifestyle that I was in,

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.060
and we knew if we were going to stay married,

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.060
we had to move away from our bad influence.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.060
We were looking for God, and we wanted Him in our life.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.060
One day, I was in the park by myself.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.060
It was a beautiful setting.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.060
There was a lake in front of me, mountain in the background.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.060
And at that point, I set a prayer to God.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.060
I told Him that we wanted to serve Him,

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.060
but we just didn't know how.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.060
About 10 minutes later, a guy walked up,

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.060
and he started talking to me about a paradise Earth.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.060
Everything he said made sense.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.060
I had read it before.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.060
The thing that really stood out to me was his explanation on hellfire.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.060
It was so clear, it was so logical, it just made sense to me.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.060
He invited us to the Kingdom Hall the next day, and we went.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.060
My wife and I will never forget that first meeting 37 years ago.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.060
I had my long hair, holes in my jeans.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.060
I don't think I even wore shoes that first time.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.060
As we're sitting there, I'm thinking that the older brother,

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.060
who's conducting on stage, he's going to find us so disgusting.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.060
But to our surprise, right after the meeting, he came up.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.060
He greeted us and invited us to spend time with his family.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.060
We don't remember anything that was said at that meeting,

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.060
but we'll never forget the greeting.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.060
We immediately started attending all the meetings at the Kingdom Hall

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.060
and also began a Bible study with the brother we met in the park.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.060
The changes in our lifestyle did not come overnight,

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.060
but the brothers were so loving and patient with us.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.060
We now had a purpose in life.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.060
The emptiness that I had felt for so long was no longer there.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.060
We no longer had to live in that self-centered lifestyle.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.060
Now we had Jehovah, we had the brothers, we had the ministry.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.060
We made our dedication to Jehovah and were baptized.
