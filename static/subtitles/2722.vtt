00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:09.810
Moses became a shepherd of the flock of his father-in-law,

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.810
Jethro, the priest of Midian.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.809
While he was leading the flock to the west side of the wilderness,

00:00:17.809 --> 00:00:22.809
he eventually came to the mountain of the true God to Horel.

00:00:22.809 --> 00:00:26.809
Then Jehovah's Angel appeared to him in a flame of fire

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:29.809
in the midst of a thorn bush.

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:34.810
As he kept looking, he saw that the thorn bush was on fire

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.810
and yet the thorn bush was not consumed.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.810
So Moses said,

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.810
I will go over to inspect this unusual site

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.810
to see why the thorn bush does not burn up.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.810
When Jehovah saw that he went over to look,

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.810
God called to him out of the thorn bush and said,

00:00:53.810 --> 00:01:00.810
Moses, Moses, to which he said,

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.810
Here I am.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.810
Then he said,

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.810
Do not come any nearer.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.810
Remove your sandals from your feet

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.810
because the place where you are standing is holy ground.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.810
He went on to say,

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.810
I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham,

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.810
the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.810
Then Moses hid his face because he was afraid to look at the true God.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.810
Jehovah added,

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.810
I have certainly seen the affliction of my people who are an Egypt.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.810
And I have heard their outcry because of those who forced them to work.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.810
I will know the pains they suffer.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.810
I will go down to rescue them out of the hand of the Egyptians

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.810
and to bring them up out of that land to a land good and spacious,

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.810
a land flowing with milk and honey,

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.810
the territory of the Canaanites, the Hittites,

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.810
the Amorites, the Parasites, the Highvites, and the Jebusites.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.810
Now look, the outcry of the people of Israel has reached me.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.810
And I have seen also the harsh way that the Egyptians are pressing them.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.810
Now come, I will send you to Pharaoh,

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.810
and you will bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt.
