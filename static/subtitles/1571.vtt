00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:13.900
After working on a sign territory, I made up my mind to put in my application for regular

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.900
buying you.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:38.560
However, things were going really well at work.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.079
Is this the right time to make a drastic change?

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:50.479
A new foreign language group was being formed in our congregation.

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:59.979
There's no way I'm joining.

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:03.939
Do you know how difficult it is?

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:06.659
Maybe this isn't right for me.

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:15.019
The culture and language are so different.

00:01:15.019 --> 00:01:30.489
What do you think?

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:34.329
With our youngest now in his own assignment?

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:37.129
Maybe we could serve where the need is greater.

00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:38.530
Like we did before the kids.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:02:10.590
We're not that energetic couple anymore.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:17.569
Maybe it's too much.

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:26.120
I shared my concerns about pioneering with someone who's been doing it for a long time.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:39.340
He reminded me of the Apostle Peter's example.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:49.780
He was a fisherman by trade, but Jesus knew he could be so much more.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:03:09.530
Peter hadn't caught anything all night, but with Jesus next to him, things would be different,

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:16.400
but Peter felt overwhelmed.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:27.150
Simon, stop being afraid.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:40.870
From now on, you will be catching men alive.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:50.419
The ministry would be his life's work.

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:55.300
The Apostle Peter faced a situation similar to mine in Syrian Antioch.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:02.599
Initially, he associated freely with Gentile Christians.

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:12.680
Then, some from the congregation in Jerusalem visited,

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:22.689
and his fear of their opinion closed his heart.

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:47.269
Jehovah used the Apostle Paul to help Peter put aside his fear of men.

00:04:47.269 --> 00:04:57.639
So I prayed to Jehovah to help me open my heart wide.

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:01.439
We turned to the wisdom of older ones,

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:07.949
and they reminded us of Peter's ministry.

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:13.029
He may have been our age when he moved to where the need was greater in Babylon.

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:16.470
They must have had concerns like ours.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.029
Could they make the trip?

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:22.389
Adapted to a different place,

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:44.060
but they trusted in Jehovah to help them succeed.

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:56.439
We can do the same.

00:05:56.439 --> 00:06:08.110
If we overcome our doubts

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:15.379
and open our hearts wide,

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:27.139
we can conquer fear

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:33.500
and receive Jehovah's blessing to the full.
