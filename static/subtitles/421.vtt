00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:13.259
Imagine that you're eating your favorite fruit, a cool crisp watermelon, a fragrant peach,

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:22.140
a juicy pear, or that apple in front of you at the breakfast table, refreshing distinctive,

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.100
nutritious, and then you get to the seed.

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:36.539
People consider that to be a waste product, and yet that seed tells us much about our creator.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.700
It's revealed for us in 2 Corinthians 9. Please turn there and we're going to consider

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:54.219
together verses 8 through 15. Jehovah has a remarkable quality that we want to discuss today.

00:00:55.179 --> 00:01:02.700
Jehovah wants us to enjoy good, delicious food today, but not only that, he wants us to enjoy it

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:11.260
again and again and again, and he wants all of our offspring to enjoy these good things again and

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:19.900
again. And if you were to plant all of the seeds in one piece of fruit, you would yield more

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:26.379
than you could possibly eat by yourself. By conservative estimates, one watermelon contains

00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:34.620
200 seeds, and each seed produces a vine and each vine produces by conservative estimates

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:46.620
to fruits. So you would have with just the seeds of one melon of 400 more watermelons, far more

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:53.260
than you could eat by yourself in one season, and there's a good reason for that. Now as we look

00:01:53.260 --> 00:02:01.579
at 2 Corinthians 9, we want to examine this passage carefully. Verse 8 begins with an important

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:10.860
expression that we need to understand clearly, God's undeserved kindness. So let's read verse 8,

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:17.099
then we'll define the term, then we'll discuss the purpose of Jehovah's undeserved kindness,

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:22.139
and eventually we'll get around to watermelons, and we'll come to understand what all this has

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:35.979
to do with our worship. 2 Corinthians 9, 8. Moreover, God is able to cause all His undeserved kindness

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:45.979
to abound toward you so that you are always completely self-sufficient in everything as well as

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:55.419
having plenty for every good work. Now first that expression undeserved kindness.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:04.539
Do you have a clear understanding of that term? It's difficult to translate perfectly in English.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:12.379
It's not an expression of judgment, as if to say, you are nowhere close to deserving this,

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:18.780
but I'm going to provide it anyway. No, that's not the concept at all. The term is describing

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:28.219
not the recipient, but the giver. Jehovah is ready to give. That is his disposition. You didn't

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:36.539
pay him first. He is disposed to share himself, his generous, good, loving, kind qualities,

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:42.780
not because you earned it and obligated him, but because that is who he is. He is great,

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:51.580
and yet he is humble and willing to give in ways grander than we could ever imagine or repay.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.819
That is what undeserved kindness means, and you'll find the essence of that definition

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:03.979
in your glossary of Bible terms. Now Jehovah could just miraculously endow people with an

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:09.180
abundance of good things as he did in the Garden of Eden, or as he did with the manna provision,

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:17.100
but he does something even better. He allows his friends to participate in showing this quality

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:23.019
of his to the extent that we can within the limitations of our human imperfection. And he does that

00:04:23.019 --> 00:04:29.980
because he knows it makes us happy. There's more happiness in giving than there isn't receiving

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:35.899
because it gives us the opportunity to show how we feel about Jehovah and about people.

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:45.019
Because our showing love draws us closer to Jehovah and it strengthens the bonds of our world

00:04:45.019 --> 00:04:53.019
by brotherhood. Now notice how all of this is borne out in that verse. God is able to cause all

00:04:53.019 --> 00:05:01.420
of his undeserved kindness to abound toward you so that you are always completely self-sufficient

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:07.579
and everything as well as having plenty for every good work. And verse 9 says just as it is written

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:17.100
at Psalm 112 verse 9, he, that is the generous person who fears Jehovah, has distributed widely.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:26.459
He has given to the poor his righteousness continues forever. So are these verses suggesting

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:34.459
that Jehovah's undeserved kindness is so great that his servants will always have enough

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:42.540
for themselves and plenty to share with others as acts of righteousness.

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:52.139
Yes, that is exactly what these verses are teaching us. The question I need to ask myself is,

00:05:53.579 --> 00:06:03.660
do I thoroughly believe that? Do I believe that a generous person suffers no loss?

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:11.660
Because Jehovah enables him to do righteous deeds because Jehovah more than makes up for it

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:17.660
with his undeserved kindness so that those acts of righteousness may continue forever.

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:29.180
Remember the evidence in every fruit and vegetable that you eat. God puts a seed in each one.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:36.540
And if you were to plan all the seeds found in one fruit, you would have more than you could

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:44.220
possibly eat by yourself. Verses 10 and 11 use this exact illustration. Now the one who abundantly

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:51.579
supplies seed to the sower and bread for eating will supply and multiply the seed for you to so

00:06:51.579 --> 00:07:00.939
and will increase the harvest of your righteousness. In everything you are being enriched for

00:07:02.459 --> 00:07:10.620
every sort of generosity which produces through us an expression of thanks to God.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:18.300
Beautiful verses. So why does Jehovah provide so bountifully? So that

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:25.019
the words of verse 8, you and I, can be generous. Clearly, generosity is an act of faith

00:07:25.899 --> 00:07:33.420
and love. But why can it be said that generosity is also an expression of worship? Well,

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:39.500
look at how verse 11 continues. Generosity produces through us an expression of thanks to God.

00:07:40.459 --> 00:07:48.699
Think of it. Your generosity causes prayer, which is worship. And not only that,

00:07:48.699 --> 00:07:54.459
verse 12 continues, because the ministry of this public service is not only to provide

00:07:54.459 --> 00:08:01.339
well for the needs of the holy ones, but also to be rich in many expressions of thanks to God.

00:08:01.899 --> 00:08:06.699
At the annual meeting, we learned about the almost 50 million dollars that our organization just

00:08:06.699 --> 00:08:13.660
spent on disaster relief during the last two service years. And we saw before and after

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:20.139
photos of the homes of some of our brothers. And we were pleased to note that our brothers

00:08:20.139 --> 00:08:30.620
are well cared for. And verse 12 calls that work a ministry. It is sacred service. And as such,

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:37.019
it results in many expressions of thanks to Jehovah. And verse 13 continues,

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:48.059
through the proof that this relief ministry gives, they glorify God because you are submissive

00:08:48.059 --> 00:08:55.179
to the good news about the Christ. Yes, you are real Christians. You live what you believe

00:08:55.899 --> 00:09:02.379
as you publicly declared. And because you are generous in your contribution to them and to all.

00:09:02.379 --> 00:09:08.779
And with supplication for you, they express affection for you because of the surpassing undeserved

00:09:08.779 --> 00:09:18.299
kindness of God upon you. Thanks be to God for his indescribable free gift. That is to say,

00:09:18.299 --> 00:09:25.259
his undeserved kindness, his disposition to be generous beyond our imagination or ability

00:09:25.259 --> 00:09:34.620
to repay. That is the gift that enables us to keep giving. Each day, millions of prayers of

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:42.539
gratitude ascend to Jehovah for your generosity. That strengthens the bonds of our brotherhood.

00:09:42.539 --> 00:09:47.820
Now how were you able to be generous? Where did you get the time, the energy, the resources,

00:09:48.379 --> 00:09:54.860
the idea, the motivation, the love, the opportunity to give of yourself in this way.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:10:00.460
Jehovah gave us these things through his undeserved kindness. And when you support Kingdom work,

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:07.580
you help those in need. And Jehovah is worshiped as the words of our days text say,

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:13.659
1 Chronicles 29, 14, everything is from Jehovah. And we have given to him what comes from his own hand.

00:10:13.659 --> 00:10:20.059
You have drawn the right conclusion from Jehovah's undeserved kindness, from his disposition to give

00:10:20.059 --> 00:10:27.899
freely. You have trusted in his promise. You have imitated his goodness. You are participating

00:10:27.899 --> 00:10:35.659
in his happiness. This is how Jehovah's organization functions. May Jehovah continue to bless you

00:10:35.659 --> 00:10:45.659
richly for your participation in that.
