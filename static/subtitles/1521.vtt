00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:08.970
Shown here is a model of the temple complex located in Jerusalem, as it may have appeared in Jesus' day.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.970
This location, one, identifies the southeastern corner of the temple.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:23.379
Since the term for temple that is used at Matthew 4.5, may refer to the entire temple complex,

00:00:23.379 --> 00:00:29.379
the battlement, or highest point of the temple, could refer to a number of different locations.

00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:32.380
Shown here is one possibility.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:46.539
Another possibility is that Jesus could have been standing on the southeastern corner of the temple area,

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:55.079
or he may have stood on another location of the temple complex.

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:05.180
A fall from any of these locations would have resulted in certain death and less Jehovah intervened.
