00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:09.960
The Bible is a modern-day treasure. It reveals the satisfying truth about God,

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.179
life, and our hope for the future. What's more, it contains another

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:23.859
priceless treasure. God's personal name Jehovah. How Jehovah preserved his name

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:29.739
in the Holy Scriptures against all attempts to remove it is a fascinating story.

00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:37.420
And it's told here in the Bible Museum at World Headquarters in Warwick. Let's take the tour.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:48.060
At the museum's entry, the divine name is shown in various languages a total of 7,216 times.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.579
That's how many times it appears in the new world translation of the Holy Scriptures.

00:00:54.299 --> 00:01:00.859
Jehovah always made his name known even to the very first humans. When Cane was born,

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:07.420
Eve declared, I have produced a male child with the help of Jehovah.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.939
After that time, people knew and used God's name. The oldest example of the divine name in

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:25.180
Hebrew letters is on the Moabite Stone from the 9th century BCE. Moabite King Misha

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:32.939
boasted against Israel. I took from it the vessels of Jehovah and offered them before Kymash.

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:40.140
There's also evidence that in ancient times God's name was used in everyday life.

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:49.260
This silver scroll from the 7th century BCE is the earliest known inscription of a Bible text

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.700
containing God's name. It reads,

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.219
Major Jehovah bless you and keep you. Major Jehovah make his face shine on you.

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:04.219
Most important, God's name was in ancient copies of the Bible text.

00:02:05.019 --> 00:02:12.460
The Fouad Papyrus from the 1st century BCE is a fragment of the Greek Septuagint,

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:20.300
the first known translation of the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek. Here's Deuteronomy chapter 32,

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:28.219
verse 3, for I will declare the name of Jehovah. Although the text is in Greek,

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:36.300
the divine name is written in Hebrew. Greek speaking Jews in Jesus' day used the Septuagint.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.699
So when Jesus read and taught from the Scriptures, people heard him use the divine name.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:52.139
Sadly, though, by the 3rd century CE, God's name was removed from the Septuagint and replaced

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:59.580
with the title Lord. As an example, the Vatican Codex from the 4th century CE

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:07.900
includes the text of the Greek Septuagint, but omits God's name. Deuteronomy chapter 32, verse 3,

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.099
here reads,

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:16.139
For I will declare the name of the Lord. But Jehovah wouldn't allow his name to be lost.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.060
It was never removed from Hebrew copies of the Bible.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:27.020
The Aleppo Codex was copied by Jewish scribes around the year 930 CE.

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:32.860
The same verse, Deuteronomy chapter 32, verse 3, says in Hebrew,

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:36.539
For I will declare the name of Jehovah.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.460
Still, for centuries, most people didn't have a Bible in their own language,

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.780
nor one that contained God's name.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.860
The Latin Volgate translated around 405 CE omitted the divine name.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:01.979
It became the official translation of the Catholic Church for over 1,000 years.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:09.340
But a new technology triggered events that would soon make the Bible widely available

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.219
and infresh translations that return God's name to its rightful place.

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:21.899
About 1453, Johannes Gutenberg produced an important edition of the Latin Volgate.

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:26.220
It was the first Bible printed using movable type.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.420
This is an original page from a Gutenberg Bible.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:39.259
While only some 180 Bibles were made, his invention sparked the printing revolution.

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:47.740
Just 20 years later, Anton Kohlberger was printing up to 1,000 Bibles per run,

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.699
making it the first mass-produced Bible.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:59.980
On display is an original copy of the second edition of Kohlberger's Latin Bible from 1477.

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:08.620
Then, in the early 1500s, Bible scholars took a renewed interest in the original Bible languages.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:15.660
For the very first time, the original language Hebrew and Greek scriptures were printed together.

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:23.019
This is the Completency in Polyglot, printed between 1514 and 1517.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.939
A polyglot is a book with text in several languages arranged in columns.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:35.579
In the Completency in Polyglot, the Bible text appears in Latin, Hebrew,

00:05:36.459 --> 00:05:37.899
Aramaic, and Greek.

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:44.860
Comparing the Hebrew text with the Latin, scholars could see where God's name had been

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:53.259
replaced in the Latin Volgate with Lord. But would seeing the divine name in the original Hebrew

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:58.620
text lead Bible translators to restore God's name in their translations?

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:09.819
Indeed, some did. In 1551, Sebastian Castelio published his fresh Latin translation of the Bible.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:17.180
He appears to be the first to use God's name consistently in a Latin translation of the Hebrew

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:25.100
scriptures. Translations into other languages were also using God's name. In 1530,

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:31.339
William Tindale published his English translation of Genesis through Deuteronomy.

00:06:31.899 --> 00:06:36.540
It was the first time that the divine name appeared in any English Bible.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:42.699
The popular Reina Valera Spanish Bible was published in 1602.

00:06:43.579 --> 00:06:47.500
It contains the divine name throughout the Hebrew scriptures.

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:56.379
This is a rare original first edition of the English King James Version of the Bible,

00:06:56.379 --> 00:07:02.620
published in 1611. It uses the name Jehovah in just four passages.

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:09.100
Still, the King James Version became the most widely printed book in the world.

00:07:09.579 --> 00:07:15.740
Some 200 years later, Benjamin Boothworth, a minister and Hebrew scholar,

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:23.019
set out to revise the King James Version. His 1817 translation was the first

00:07:23.019 --> 00:07:27.899
English Bible to use the divine name throughout the Hebrew scriptures.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:36.220
Meanwhile, church missionaries were taking the Bible to new lands. But without the divine name,

00:07:36.939 --> 00:07:41.899
people couldn't distinguish the God of the Bible from their own false gods.

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:48.939
So Bible translations and many languages of Asia, Africa, the Pacific Islands,

00:07:48.939 --> 00:07:56.620
and the Americas included God's name. The Chinese delegates version from 1854

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:02.939
is an example of a missionary Bible that uses God's name throughout the Hebrew scriptures.

00:08:03.899 --> 00:08:12.939
Still, there was one more place where God's name was not yet restored, the Christian Greek scriptures.

00:08:13.899 --> 00:08:19.899
This is the Nuremberg Polyglot, published by Elias Hutter in 1599.

00:08:20.699 --> 00:08:25.899
It contains the Christian Greek scriptures in 12 languages, including Hebrew.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:32.940
Here, John's Gospel quotes Psalm 118 verse 26,

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:40.700
Blessed is the one who comes in Jehovah's name. In his Hebrew translation of the gospel,

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:48.139
Hunter preserved the divine name in the quotation from Psalms. He did this in many other places in the

00:08:48.139 --> 00:08:56.779
Greek scriptures. Translators had a precedent to use God's name in the Christian Greek scriptures

00:08:56.779 --> 00:09:03.659
where the name appeared in verses quoted from the Hebrew scriptures. This is the 1864

00:09:03.659 --> 00:09:11.500
6th edition New Testament translation by Hermann Heinfetter. It's likely the first published

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:18.139
English Bible to use God's name in more than 100 places in the Christian Greek scriptures.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:27.740
The New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures was first published between 1950 and 1960.

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:35.740
Its translators benefited from the scholarly work of those before them who had chosen to preserve

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:43.179
God's name in their Bible translations. Today, the New World Translation is available in

00:09:43.179 --> 00:09:53.740
whole or in part in over 170 languages. God's name, Jehovah, belongs in the Holy Scriptures he inspired.

00:09:55.659 --> 00:10:03.500
This gallery holds just a small part of the overwhelming evidence to this fact.

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:11.820
The Bible is a precious gift from God, teaching us about his works, his qualities,

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:19.820
and his loving purpose for humankind. He invites each of us to read it, to draw close to him,

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:28.539
and to know him by his most holy name, Jehovah.
