00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:07.960
In His Word, Jehovah has promised to bring peace to His loyal servants.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.480
As we have learned, that peace is more than the absence of conflict.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.760
It involves our overall well-being, including our health and security.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:27.120
God's heart-warming promises feel us with appreciation and hope.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:33.600
In the Bible book of the 145th Psalm, it tells us in verses 15 and 16,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.960
all eyes look hopefully to you.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.560
You give them their food in a season.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.479
You open your hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing.

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:55.079
In this symposium we will consider the past, present, and future fulfillment of several

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.359
Bible prophecies of peace that are found in the book of Isaiah.

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:09.000
Jehovah promises to provide an abundance of both literal food and spiritual food.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.920
When the Israelites loyally served Jehovah, they experienced the blessings foretold at

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.640
Isaiah 4910.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:26.400
Today, Jehovah's servants are experiencing the fulfillment of Isaiah 65 verses 13-14.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:34.640
There you'll find it to say, therefore this is what the sovereign Lord Jehovah says.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.640
Look, my servants will eat, but you will go hungry.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.920
Look, my servants will drink, but you will go thirsty.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.280
Look, my servants will rejoice, but you will suffer shame.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.519
Look, my servants will shout joyfully because of the good condition of the heart, but you

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:08.120
will cry out because of the pain of heart, and you will wail because of a broken spirit.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:15.479
Although we may, at times, experience literal hunger, we enjoy an abundance of satisfying

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:18.560
spiritual food.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:25.000
In the future, Jehovah will completely eliminate literal hunger.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.719
As you watch the following video, think about the blessings we enjoy now, and the ones

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:37.759
we will enjoy in the future.

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:59.210
Through Isaiah, Jehovah promised to feed his servants physically and spiritually.

00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:11.000
Today, Jehovah invites us to a banquet that is spiritually nourishing.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:32.189
Bible-based videos and publications draw us close to God and satisfy our hunger for truth.

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:43.000
In the New World, abundant healthy food will be more than a promise.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:04:08.150
It will be a reality.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.389
There will be an abundance of grain on the earth.

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:18.810
On the top of the mountains, it will overflow.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.769
What a blessing it is to be among Jehovah's people.

00:04:23.769 --> 00:04:30.810
Spiritual provisions flow to us like an ever-broadening and ever-deepening river.

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.889
There is not a grain of salt missing.

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:40.269
Not a slice of bread or a patabutter.

00:04:40.269 --> 00:04:44.790
There is way too much to eat at one meal.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.470
We have to come to Jehovah's table several times a week to keep our spiritual fiber

00:04:50.470 --> 00:05:00.069
intact and energy strong for the work we engage in, the kingdom preaching.

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:11.480
We have an abundance of nourishing food, Bible-based publications, recordings and videos, meetings

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.480
and conventions.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.480
Website material.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:21.319
Jehovah has not deviated from his promise.

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:25.439
Note this one, Psalm 72-16.

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:29.199
There will be an abundance of grain on the earth.

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:33.120
On the top of the mountains, it will overflow.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:39.199
His fruit will flourish as in Lebanon, and in the city's people will blossom like the

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:42.839
vegetation of the earth.

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:48.360
Then again, Isaiah 30, verse 23.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:54.600
And he will give the rain for the seed you sow in the ground.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:01.800
And the bread that the ground produces will be abundant and rich.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:09.120
In that day, your livestock will graze in spacious pastures.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:14.240
Jehovah has placed everything we need on the table.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:20.439
We must willfully come to the table and sit down and eat.

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:26.439
He doesn't make us come, like some mothers may have to demand a reluctant child to come

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:31.920
to the house from plain and eat a meal.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:38.319
Be sure to thank Jehovah for the spiritual food he provides.

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:42.319
Psalm 100, verses 2 and 3, reminds us,

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:51.519
served Jehovah with rejoicing, coming to his presence with joyful shouting.

00:06:51.519 --> 00:06:55.680
Know that Jehovah is God.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.120
He is the one who made us, and we belong to him.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:06.180
We are his people and the sheep of his pasture.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:14.500
Show your appreciation, how, by studying diligently, and applying what you learn.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:20.540
If you lack sufficient material things now, take delight in meditating on future kingdom

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.019
blessings.

00:07:23.019 --> 00:07:28.220
Jehovah will surely fulfill his promises just as he has always done.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:33.459
Isaiah 55, 10 and 11, remind us.

00:07:33.459 --> 00:07:40.660
For just as the rain and the snow pour down from heaven, and do not return there until

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:50.379
they saturate the earth, making it produce and sprout, giving seed to the sore and bread

00:07:50.379 --> 00:07:52.379
to the eater.

00:07:52.379 --> 00:08:00.300
So my word that goes out of my mouth will be, it will not return to me without resolve,

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:06.379
but it will certainly accomplish whatever is my delight.

00:08:06.379 --> 00:08:12.019
And it will have sure success in what I send it to do.

00:08:12.019 --> 00:08:18.339
Brother Ronald Curson, a helper to the teaching committee, will now present the next talk

00:08:18.339 --> 00:08:20.620
of this symposium.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:24.259
Take delight in God's promises of peace.

00:08:24.259 --> 00:08:28.139
They will build houses and plant vineyards.
