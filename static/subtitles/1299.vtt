00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:09.960
Soon after the governing body released a revised English edition of the New World Translation,

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.199
they decided to revise a Spanish edition.

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:20.199
They wanted it to be a modern, understandable translation for the entire Spanish-speaking

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.199
world.

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.440
Spanish is a mother tongue of around 480 million people, and it is also the most widely

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.159
spoken language among Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.719
This translation project would be a unique challenge.

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.399
It eventually took four and a half years to complete.

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:41.759
Why did it take so long?

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:47.560
Apart from the translation process itself, the work was complicated by the wide,

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.799
graphic range of these Hispanic countries and their different cultures.

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:59.039
It is diversity meant that in different countries, the same Spanish word could mean different

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.039
things.

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:06.319
In other cases, the word may be unknown in certain areas or even sound objectionable

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:07.760
to some.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.239
To overcome these difficulties, the translators used 100 outside readers for many different

00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:18.719
countries to review the translated text progressively.

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:23.200
These readers were of different ages, cultures and backgrounds.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.840
These outside readers regularly received chapters of the Bible electronically, and then they

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.519
introduced their suggested revisions.

00:01:32.519 --> 00:01:37.480
The translation teams took note of all their recommendations, and in some cases they

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.239
also sent them specific inquiries.

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:45.799
Every verse was checked by 130 different people.

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.560
Naturally, all of this took time.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:57.439
The work was finished in the spring of 2019, but then another challenge arose.

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.319
We needed to print millions of Bibles to satisfy the demand of the Spanish-speaking

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:03.319
field.

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:08.280
This was a huge job for our printing presses in the United States and Japan.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.680
Despite working night and day, the task would take a long time, and naturally everyone

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.199
wanted to have the Bible right away.

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:22.000
So right at the Madrid International Convention, the governing body decided to release the Bible

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.680
in digital format.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.159
This was several months before all the Bibles could be printed.

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:31.479
The highlight of the Friday morning convention program was when Brother Loas presented the

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:35.759
new Revised Bible, but there was another surprise.

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:39.520
Since I think I mentioned, most brothers and sisters had their phones and tablets with

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.800
them, they were able to immediately download the Revised Bible.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.080
How is that possible?

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:54.000
500 portable Wi-Fi devices were distributed among each of the 11 convention venues in Spain

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.039
that were tied in with the Madrid Stadium.

00:02:57.039 --> 00:03:02.240
During the lunch break on Friday, practically everyone in attendance could download the

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.159
Revised Spanish edition of the New World Translation.

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:11.360
More than 1,200 volunteers were trained to give technical support to those who needed

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.360
it.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.120
In this way, the brothers started to use the Revised Translation right away during the afternoon

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.919
program.

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:24.240
We laughed and cried with joy.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.039
We knew it was a gift from Jehovah, which he was given as at that moment, and also we

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:33.280
felt so happy because we'd been waiting a long time for it.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.360
What I most like about this revision is that it's very easy to understand.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.759
Sometimes I think, but was this what we had before?

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:44.719
It seems that it reaches my heart much quicker.

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:49.800
As you use it, you realise that many scriptures have been adjusted, and that the faithful

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:56.300
slave has worked very hard to make it easier to understand.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.139
Without a doubt, this Revised edition of the New World Translation is a wonderful gift

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:05.020
for all our Spanish-speaking brothers.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:12.259
The Word of God has power, and this will be a powerful tool to help many people get to

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:13.259
know Jehovah.
