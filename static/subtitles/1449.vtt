00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:14.589
In September of 2020, Medican Janos, a rare Mediterranean cyclone, struck Greece and flooded

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:22.179
a Roma settlement in Maverica, just outside the city of Cardezza.

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:27.339
Local authorities worked alongside emergency services to evacuate over 1,000 Roma who lived

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:35.649
there, but a family of seven who are studying with Jehovah's Witnesses were left behind.

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.469
It was raining hard and the floodwaters were rising quickly.

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.469
I took my wife by the hand and carried my child on my back.

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.590
With great difficulty, we managed to make it to a neighbouring house.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.390
We were unable to contact the authorities.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.429
We were terrified and had no option but to stay there.

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:56.630
We didn't know what to do.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.630
We were so scared and worried.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.990
We had never experienced anything like this before.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.790
The floodwaters had risen a lot and we stood waiting for hours.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.390
I asked my father to pray for us.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.989
He did, many times.

00:01:13.989 --> 00:01:17.670
There were lots of people in the house, both young and old.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:26.140
They were afraid and they were crying.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.659
Video messages from the family started to come through asking for help.

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.659
We could see their fear.

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.340
We wanted to help them, but there was no way for us to go there because access was impossible.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.939
All we could do was pray to Jehovah for them and send messages of encouragement.

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.140
We were very distressed.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.859
Children were crying.

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:53.659
I prayed to Jehovah begging him for peace of mind.

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.180
I threw all my burdens and anxiety up my heart on Jehovah.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.540
Soon I felt calm and had no anxiety.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:23.310
I felt his spirit giving me strength during the hours that followed until dawn.

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.830
The situation was very difficult.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.509
They had suffered a lot and their clothes were dirty.

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:34.330
There was no way that I could leave them there.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.810
We were given a house to staying.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.129
We were able to calm down and sleep.

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.370
The brothers gave us food.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.050
I thanked Jehovah for teaching us and taking care of us.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.729
He is our savior.

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:56.810
When I attended the first meeting after the flood, I felt calm again.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.050
I tried to keep my routine as normal.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:07.930
Study, meetings, preparing comments, I felt joy and contentment.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.169
My legal documents such as my ID were safe on the flood.

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:20.409
Our neighbours were not prepared, but we, thanks to Jehovah's direction, had packed emergency bags.

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:24.090
About a week later, we were able to return to America.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.370
The houses were in a terrible condition, full of mud.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.090
The disaster relief committee helped us immediately.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.729
Brothers from 300 kilometres away sent emergency supplies.

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:42.090
The brotherhood showed us love in practice.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.610
They worked hard and helped us because they love us.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.650
I was deeply touched and found myself in awe.

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:50.289
We are united.

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:55.810
All of this brought glory and praise to Jehovah.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.810
When we went there to help, the Roma neighbours were very surprised.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.210
They asked if we could help them too.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.849
We replied that we have to help our family first, our brothers.

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:10.569
They were very puzzled that we called our Roma brothers family

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.310
since we were not from their tribe.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.750
Ephesians 416 finds a good application in this story.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.350
Just as every joint in the body offers help.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.110
So did the brothers.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:34.079
We all work together to provide help to our brothers in need.

00:04:34.079 --> 00:04:37.439
Jehovah's teaching me and helping me.

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:39.079
I really trust in him.

00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:41.720
He has blessed me personally.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.759
I've seen how good he is to me.

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:48.240
In a miserable world, Jehovah brings me joy.

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:52.199
I know that he chooses according to a person's heart.

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:54.680
All glory belongs to Jehovah.
