00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.620
It was Jesus last night with His apostles.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.230
You were the ones who have stuck with me in my trials.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.730
Soon, Jesus would be arrested.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.730
It was going to be very hard for them.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.729
All of you will be stumbled in connection with me on this night.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:34.130
For it is written,

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.130
I will strike the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered about.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.229
They were going to run away and abandon Jesus.

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.130
But Peter said,

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.130
although all the others are stumbled in connection with you,

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.929
I will never be stumbled.

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:53.130
Very good Caleb.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:59.390
Peter thought he was strong and would never make Jehovah said.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.890
I tell you, Peter,

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:07.590
a rooster will not crow today until you have denied knowing me three times.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.590
Cuckoo!

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.590
No, it's cuckoo-do-do-do!

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.590
No, that's not a rooster.

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:18.489
Your kids, it's not important color rooster sounds.

00:01:18.489 --> 00:01:20.890
I'll never make Jehovah sad.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.590
Me neither.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.989
We know you never want to.

00:01:24.989 --> 00:01:27.989
But Jesus knew Peter would be afraid.

00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:31.170
And when you are afraid?

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.769
Oh no, you're late.

00:01:32.769 --> 00:01:34.370
Hurry, grab your bags.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.700
Be careful.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.299
Love you kids.

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.200
See you later.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:02:26.680
Be good.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:44.500
Anybody?

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.500
Are you okay?

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:54.960
What if Jehovah doesn't want to be my friend anymore?

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.560
Jehovah wants to be your friend.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.060
But if he did something bad,

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.889
he wants you to tell.

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:07.590
Today at school,

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:55.580
I was outside on the plane, girl.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.400
It was just...

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.729
Wait!

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:04.229
Yeah, which is it?

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:14.780
Fine.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.350
What did you say?

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.649
But you can, to my house,

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:21.350
get the other day to talk about the Bible.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.350
Don't you remember?

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.350
Yeah.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:38.420
Maybe that wasn't me.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:05:00.370
That was you, but you're scared.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.160
That was a rough day.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.399
Do you remember when Peter said he would never stumble?

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:11.899
Later that night,

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:28.459
Jesus was arrested.

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:31.459
Peter loved him and wanted to help.

00:05:31.459 --> 00:05:47.720
In the right thing,

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:57.360
isn't always easy.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.939
You two were with Jesus the Galilean.

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:12.720
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.220
Wait!

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:19.839
This is one of them.

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:37.740
I do not know the man.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.339
Hey, you follow Jesus.

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:41.839
I saw you in garden with him.

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:44.899
Did I not?

00:06:44.899 --> 00:06:47.399
I swear I do not know the man.

00:06:47.399 --> 00:07:32.240
You're the right thing to do.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.339
But he was afraid and did the wrong thing.

00:07:35.339 --> 00:07:48.439
Don't like a school?

00:07:48.439 --> 00:07:50.439
Yes.

00:07:50.439 --> 00:07:55.839
Peter didn't want to make that mistake ever again.

00:07:55.839 --> 00:07:57.939
But he wondered if Jesus and Jehovah

00:07:57.939 --> 00:08:16.959
would still be his friends.

00:08:16.959 --> 00:08:18.959
After Jesus was resurrected,

00:08:18.959 --> 00:08:22.410
he talked to Peter.

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:24.810
Simon, son of John.

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:27.110
Do you love me?

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:28.209
Yes.

00:08:28.209 --> 00:08:32.710
Lord, you know I have affection for you.

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:35.509
Jesus forgave him.

00:08:35.509 --> 00:08:37.809
And so did Jehovah.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:40.909
But Peter had to talk to Jesus.

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:43.409
If you upset Jehovah,

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:45.909
what do you think you have to do?

00:08:45.909 --> 00:08:47.710
Talk to Jehovah.

00:08:47.809 --> 00:08:49.610
That's right.

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:53.809
You need to pray to ask for forgiveness.

00:08:53.809 --> 00:08:56.309
And Jesus showed Peter that he was forgiven

00:08:56.309 --> 00:08:59.210
by giving him more work to do.

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:10.080
Shepherd my little sheep.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.980
So why didn't Peter give up when he made a mistake?

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.980
Because Jehovah forgives.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:26.769
Hey, guys.

00:09:26.769 --> 00:09:29.519
Oh, wait.

00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:31.120
Explain birthdays.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.120
Can you help me?

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.120
Of course.
