00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:07.440
I first learned about the Bible from a friend in my second year of high school.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.519
I became convinced that the Bible's record of Jehovah God's existence was the truth.

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:21.320
So I decided I wanted to serve him for the rest of my life and decided not to go to college.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.239
My family was very angry with my decision, especially my uncle who was a doctor.

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:33.560
They burnt my clothes and my identification card and then he beat me for many hours.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.840
I had no choice but to run away.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.479
I ended up in a city far away where I was able to find a kingdom hall.

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:45.039
The brothers and sisters there showed me warm hospitality.

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:49.000
I got baptized that year when I was 19.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.960
In January of 1971 my wife and I were assigned to the circuit work and we were enjoying it.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.280
And unexpectedly my wife became seriously ill.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.079
She had to receive immediate medical attention.

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.200
Eventually due to her condition, we had to discontinue our service for a time.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:16.230
We are so grateful to Jehovah who supported us in ways beyond our imagination during that difficult time.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:23.750
In March 2015, due to low blood pressure, I fell and hit my head in the parking lot of our apartment.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.709
Since we have no children, some might wonder who came to our aid.

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:31.390
But when we arrived at the emergency room,

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:38.150
brothers from many congregations were already there waiting for us even before our ambulance arrived.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.230
We are still truly grateful for their support.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.629
We are convinced that Jehovah has always been with us these past decades.

00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:51.590
And we are certain that no matter what the situation,

00:01:51.590 --> 00:02:00.750
He will always protect us and guide us through any tribulation, any hardship or any difficulty that may arise.
