00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:10.779
It's my great pleasure to speak for a few minutes to you dear beloved servants of Jehovah.

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:19.859
As you well know, we've been dealing with the effects of this pandemic for a long time.

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.579
Are you tired of wearing a mask?

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:26.620
Tired of physical distancing?

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.940
No doubt you miss getting together in person.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:39.299
Because this is lasting so long, it may be tempting to lower your guard and ease up on the

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:42.899
precautions we've been taking.

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:52.140
But as you're probably aware, case numbers have risen sharply in one country after another.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:00.299
In fact, case numbers and deaths worldwide are higher than they have ever been at any

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:04.500
point during the pandemic.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.980
This is not a time to let down our guard.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:16.489
Proverbs 28.14 says,

00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:22.930
Happy is the man who is always on guard.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:29.650
But whoever hardens his heart will fall into calamity.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:38.209
If we're always on guard like a watchman at his post, that can help us avoid the calamity.

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:46.450
In this update, we'd like to discuss why we need to stay safe and how we can do so.

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:55.810
And we'll hear some experiences that highlight the benefits of keeping on guard.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:02.890
First, let's talk about why we need to protect ourselves and others.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:12.370
As the months have gone by, if we or our family have not contracted COVID-19, it can be easy

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.770
to think, My family and I won't get the virus.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.330
The Bible warns us though about being overconfident.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.930
First Corinthians chapter 10 verse 12 says,

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:40.900
So let the one who thinks he is standing beware that he does not fall in line with that

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.819
principle, rather than being overconfident when it comes to our safety and thinking it

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:57.020
can happen to me, we have good reason to beware and remain cautious.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:08.020
Sadly, as of December 20th, more than 7,500 of our brothers and sisters worldwide have

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.060
died from COVID-19.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:22.780
Our hearts go out to those who have lost dear family members and friends, and unfortunately,

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:30.500
the tragic effects of this pandemic are not over.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.740
Some branches have reported two to three times more cases among the brothers in just

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:42.699
the last month than they've had this entire year.

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:46.780
So we need to stay safe.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:54.580
In the following video, note how brother Peter canning from the Croatia branch explains

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:04.939
how vigilance is helping our brothers stay as safe as possible.

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:09.939
At the beginning of June, life in Croatia seemed to be getting back to normal.

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:14.860
Some days there were no new reported cases of the virus in the entire country.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:21.100
So businesses and restaurants reopened and tourists flooded back into Croatia.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.779
Some brothers wondered, can we restart certain activities such as public witnessing?

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:30.980
Well, shortly after that, as a safety precaution, the governing body directed all branches

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.180
not to resume public witnessing until further notice.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:40.100
At first, this level of caution was not easy to understand, as conditions seemed relatively

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.379
safe for public witnessing.

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:44.899
But what a wise decision it proved to be.

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:50.100
Within weeks, the number of cases in Croatia began to rise, and now there are thousands

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.819
being infected every day.

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:57.540
Our experiences made us even more determined to pay close attention to the direction coming

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.740
from the organisation and be ready to follow it.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:06.860
We cannot let our guard down.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:13.660
As brother canning said, we should not let down our guard.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.860
So what will help us stay safe?

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:24.980
Well back in June in governing body update number four, brother Morris stated three key

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.379
principles to serve as a guide.

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:32.459
It was good advice then.

00:05:32.459 --> 00:05:38.699
Even with the infection rates rising, it's really good advice now.

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:42.220
Let's review those principles.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:48.339
Number one, place a high value on life.

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:52.779
Although the precautions you are taking may be inconvenient.

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:59.699
Remember, they protect you and your family's lives.

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:04.300
Number two, listen to the authorities.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:12.139
When we follow their safety guidelines, we shall respect for Jova's arrangement and demonstrate

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:17.500
that we really care about our neighbours.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:23.500
Number three, do not develop a casual attitude.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:32.220
As this situation stretches on, please don't lower your guard.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.540
Those are three excellent principles.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:41.379
But now here's a question to ask yourself.

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:50.220
Do my decisions show that I place a high value on life, listen to the authorities and

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:54.879
have not developed a casual attitude?

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:58.839
Whatever decisions you make consider this.

00:06:58.839 --> 00:07:06.720
Your decisions affect not just yourself, but your household, your brothers and sisters,

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.199
and your community.

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:12.879
That's a sobering thought, isn't it?

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:21.040
As you consider how you and your family will handle activities in the coming months,

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:28.800
we urge you to keep following the basic safety guidelines.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:36.519
Remember how COVID-19 is spread and what you can do to protect yourself.

00:07:36.519 --> 00:07:39.639
Here's a brief overview.

00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:47.560
Health experts agree that the main way the virus spreads is through the air.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:57.079
So when someone infected coughs, sneezes, speaks, or even breathes, they can't spread

00:07:57.079 --> 00:07:59.759
the virus.

00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:07.160
Even if someone infected with a virus doesn't have symptoms, he or she can still spread

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.959
the virus to others.

00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:16.480
There's an even higher risk if we're in close contact with others.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:22.000
Encrowded places are indoors.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.639
One of the best ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is to wear a mask and maintain physical

00:08:29.639 --> 00:08:32.440
distancing.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:39.440
To review other precautions you can take to protect yourself, we've created a new whiteboard

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:48.679
animation entitled Virus Outbreaks, what you can do.

00:08:48.679 --> 00:08:57.120
This video is now available in English on jw.org and will be available in other languages

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.440
soon.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:03.120
Please take the time to watch it.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:08.679
No doubt you'd agree that it takes effort to remain vigilant.

00:09:08.679 --> 00:09:11.519
But how can that benefit us?

00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:17.360
Do you recall what we read earlier in Proverbs 28-14?

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:24.000
HAPPY is the man who is always on guard.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:31.159
In this video interview, notice how Sister Louis Slimter, who is a remote volunteer with

00:09:31.159 --> 00:09:41.080
a remote translation office in the United States, has benefited by remaining on guard.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:51.279
You'll also see the tragic impact that COVID-19 has had on her non-witness relatives.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:10:02.940
I live on the Navajo land, a place called Tuba City, Arizona.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:10.779
When it came the pandemic, I thought we were so isolated that it was not going to happen

00:10:10.779 --> 00:10:12.860
here in Tuba City.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:21.059
It affected my family a lot on first wave, the last 15.

00:10:21.059 --> 00:10:29.179
And then after that, some were hospitalized and then up to today.

00:10:29.179 --> 00:10:38.220
I have lost 35 and still some are still sick and hospitalized.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:44.419
It makes me really sad because it's really a serious thing.

00:10:44.419 --> 00:10:50.500
So right now, my household is just a three.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:56.259
And anybody outside the household could be a risk.

00:10:56.259 --> 00:11:01.700
It's very difficult because you're used to being around them for years and years and

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.220
all this sudden, this happens.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:11.340
And I have to look at it that anybody can be positive or anybody can have it.

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:14.379
So I just keep my distance.

00:11:14.379 --> 00:11:16.460
I don't want to get sick.

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:19.779
I just precaution, you know.

00:11:19.779 --> 00:11:23.659
That's what we're out of Jehovah's word.

00:11:23.659 --> 00:11:27.340
What I read, we're clean people, we're Jehovah's people.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.460
So we have to be clean.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:37.179
We wear masks and we wash our hand and wipe everything that comes into the house, even

00:11:37.179 --> 00:11:38.179
mail.

00:11:38.379 --> 00:11:46.700
A COVID is very serious, a pandemic that takes your loved ones.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:55.899
You know, people you love and it's so sad and it has took in many beautiful people.

00:11:55.899 --> 00:11:58.740
Like my relatives, they're very knowledgeable.

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:04.139
They do craft, they do work, they have houses, they have.

00:12:04.139 --> 00:12:15.179
And now you see if their tools are left behind, nobody to pick up their fields, they didn't

00:12:15.179 --> 00:12:16.500
even put a seed in.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:24.379
They just prepared it, but never put a seed in their homes, their their transportation,

00:12:24.379 --> 00:12:27.940
just sitting there now.

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:38.620
So all the warnings that they put out are really true warnings and very important that

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:41.700
we follow it.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:47.419
Our hearts go out to Sister Slender and her family.

00:12:47.419 --> 00:12:53.299
Doesn't her experience illustrate the benefits of staying on guard?

00:12:53.299 --> 00:13:00.340
What a protection following direction has been for Sister Slender, her husband and her

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:03.139
son.

00:13:03.139 --> 00:13:07.940
So in review, what have we discussed?

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:16.419
Now is not the time to slacken our hand when it comes to safety.

00:13:16.419 --> 00:13:19.340
Don't let your guard down.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:24.659
Don't think the virus can affect you or your family.

00:13:24.659 --> 00:13:30.539
Even with the best of efforts, some of you may still get sick.

00:13:30.539 --> 00:13:35.100
Our prayers are with you and your families.

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:47.899
We long for the day when Jehovah fulfills his promise that no one will say, I am sick.

00:13:47.899 --> 00:13:50.179
Please stay safe.

00:13:50.179 --> 00:13:53.139
Stay connected to your congregation.

00:13:53.139 --> 00:13:58.460
And above all, stay close to Jehovah.

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:07.059
With Jehovah's help, we're sure that you can cope with any challenge you face.

00:14:07.059 --> 00:14:15.179
It's my privilege to share with you the warm greetings of the governing body.

00:14:15.179 --> 00:14:20.259
We love you all very much.

00:14:20.259 --> 00:14:28.659
