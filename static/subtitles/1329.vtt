00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:07.919
Bible translations in common languages started to spread across Europe in the 1500s, but it

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.980
took much longer for more remote places to receive the Bible.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:20.719
It was in 1766 that the complete Greek scriptures or New Testament was first published in Green

00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:26.739
Landek, a language spoken today by about 50,000 people.

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:32.740
In August of last year, I had the privilege of serving a regional convention in Greenland,

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.340
which is overseen by the Scandinavia branch.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.420
Greenland is the neighbor to the north of Newfoundland, where I pioneered for 11 years, so it

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.740
was a wonderful experience to go there and meet our brothers.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:53.380
Some 400 brothers and sisters traveled at their own expense from all over Scandinavia

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.780
to support the convention in Greenland.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.979
Although Greenland is a land covered by large ice caps, there are many warm hearts yearning

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:16.310
for the truth.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.269
I think that Jesus had Greenland in mind when he spoke about preaching to the most distant

00:01:21.269 --> 00:01:24.230
part of the earth.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.030
My name is Arna Matson.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.909
My wife Karen and I have lived in Greenland for more than 34 years.

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.230
We have traveled all over the country preaching about God Kingdom, and we have had some fantastic

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.629
experiences.

00:01:38.629 --> 00:01:44.670
In the 1950s, two young special pioneers came to Greenland as the first publishers.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.670
They traveled by boat from town to town, carrying just tents and simple equipment.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.030
They had to endure the cold weather, face resistance from the local ministers, and even

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.349
fight with sledge dogs that took their food.

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:03.870
But they laid the groundwork for the great effort that has been made to preach to all

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.150
in this country.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:12.310
In the 1960s and 70s, many families moved here from Denmark to help with the preaching

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.310
work.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.629
I remember how I as a teenager in 1971 moved from Denmark to Greenland with my family.

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.789
It was not easy to learn the language, but the brothers and sisters from Denmark did

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:29.710
their best, and it had a good effect on the territory.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.710
In 1973, the watchtower began to be published in Greenlandic.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:40.949
Just to pronounce the name, Nabazoliak, Alabama, Suifik, was a challenge.

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:47.060
But it has been a popular magazine in Greenland ever since.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.460
Once we met a couple who for many years had received copies of the watchtower when

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.139
publishers visited their settlement.

00:02:54.139 --> 00:03:00.259
They told us that they often felt depressed when they woke up in the morning.

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:04.580
But when they read the magazine, they felt better, and they would read the same copies

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:13.460
over and over again.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.139
When the temperature drops and the snow falls, the landscape gets covered by a beautiful

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:20.819
white blanket for half a year.

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.530
So the publishers make good use of the summer.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.250
Some towns and settlements only seldom receive a witness.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.250
There are no roads between the towns, but we reach isolated areas by boat.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:41.680
When someone shows interest in our message, the contact is maintained by phone.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.960
Many have great respect for the Bible, and so my book of Bible stories has found its way

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.080
into many, many homes.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.520
Over a period of 24 years, Karen and I have sailed so much that it equals a trip trice

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.280
around the globe.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.879
This has cost a lot of effort and money, but with your hovers blessing, we have been able

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:13.259
to continue year after year, preaching to the distant parts of Greenland.

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:16.579
The preaching work here is a great experience.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:22.019
People are attentive and kind, but it took a long time before the first native Greenland

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:29.360
that was baptized, actually 18 years of zealous preaching.

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:34.959
Today there are more than 150 publishers in five congregations.

00:04:34.959 --> 00:04:50.110
Jehovah has really blessed the work that has been done here for more than 60 years.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:56.990
In August 2016, a very special convention was held in the capital of Munich.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:07.379
Brothers and sisters from all over Scandinavia traveled all the way to attend the convention.

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:12.459
We were very encouraged by the visit of a member of the governing body, Brother Marc Sanderson,

00:05:12.459 --> 00:05:19.120
who gave us some faith-strengthening talks.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.000
I think it's a great privilege to be able to understand the truth.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:32.600
It's amazing that Jehovah gave his attention to an insignificant human like me.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:40.040
When I started to follow the Bible's unique teachings and principles, I clearly understood

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.560
how it would benefit my own life.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:50.360
After this convention, even though we live in small towns far away from the rest of the world,

00:05:50.360 --> 00:06:02.069
we feel closer than ever before to the worldwide brotherhood.

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:08.709
The peak attendance at the convention was 614, the largest ever in Greenland.

00:06:08.709 --> 00:06:12.550
Our brothers from other parts of Scandinavia who attended the convention

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.269
also took part in a campaign inviting interested ones.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:21.470
In only two hours, the whole capital city of Nook was covered.

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.470
It was a wonderful witness.
