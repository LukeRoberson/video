00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:06.099
How quickly the convention has gone by.

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:08.339
You may feel like you just arrived,

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:11.539
and now the convention is nearly over.

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:15.500
What lessons will you take away?

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.579
Well, this convention was designed to deepen our understanding

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:21.579
of the gospel accounts,

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:25.379
to strengthen our faith in the good news,

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:30.379
and to motivate us to share the good news with others.

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.979
Let's begin by reviewing how the convention

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:37.380
deepened our understanding of the gospel accounts.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.179
The symposium Lessons from the Land of Jesus

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:43.219
explained the environment and customs

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:45.700
that we saw depicted in episode one

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.740
of the good news according to Jesus.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.100
We examined how people lived, worked,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.340
and worshipped in Jesus' day.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.179
Did you note this key lesson?

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:02.100
When the Israelites faithfully followed Jehovah's direction,

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.859
they benefited.

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:07.540
The same is true of us.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.060
We are not under God's law to Israel,

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.939
but the principles behind the law

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.219
still guide Christians today.

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:19.540
We exert ourselves to share in true worship.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.859
Parents teach their children practical skills

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:25.299
and teach them about Jehovah.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.930
And all of us make time for the more important things.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.049
As you watched episode one of the Good News

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:34.810
according to Jesus,

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.329
did you gain greater insight into the thoughts

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:42.489
and feelings of Zachariah and Elizabeth, Mary and Joseph,

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:45.409
Simeon and Anna and young Jesus?

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:51.379
Why did Jehovah use these ones as he did?

00:01:51.379 --> 00:01:52.819
They were humble.

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:54.659
They loved Jehovah,

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.980
and they had faith in Jehovah's word of promise.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.500
Do you recall how we can imitate them?

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:04.420
By accepting correction.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.919
By focusing on our blessings, not on our disappointments.

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:16.969
By strengthening our friendship with Jehovah,

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:20.250
by giving priority to our family's spiritual needs.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.729
By encouraging others, despite having our own challenges.

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.169
And by strengthening our conviction

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:33.939
and taking a firm stand for what is right.

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:36.580
Next, let's consider how the convention

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.219
strengthen our faith in the Good News.

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.699
In the symposium they were moved by Holy Spirit.

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:47.139
We took a careful look at each of the four gospels,

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:50.180
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:54.539
We considered why we can trust these ancient writings.

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:57.939
The writers either personally witnessed the events

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:01.939
they recorded, or they did careful research.

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:04.620
Their accounts are historically accurate

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.699
and in agreement with one another.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.979
Do you recall some of the evidence

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:12.939
that the gospel accounts have been reliably transmitted

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:14.020
down to our day?

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.300
We can't help but be in awe of what Jehovah has accomplished.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.460
By using his Holy Spirit to guide the gospel writers,

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.819
and by preserving their accounts,

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.259
he has left us with a remarkably trustworthy

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:33.900
and intimate portrayal of his son.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.979
More than any other book in the world,

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:40.699
these four, along with the rest of the Bible,

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:45.699
convinces that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.259
We also strengthened our faith

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:53.340
by considering six prophecies whose fulfillment was shown

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.699
in episode one of the good news according to Jesus.

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:00.500
These prophecies clearly point to Jesus

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.780
as the foretold Messiah.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.379
Their fulfillment could not have been coincidence.

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:10.219
Rather, we saw how Jehovah maneuvered events

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:12.139
so that the prophecies were fulfilled.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.939
What does this mean for us?

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.779
Not only can we be certain that Jesus is the Messiah,

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:22.259
we can also have complete confidence

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:24.819
that all remaining Messianic prophecies,

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:27.779
including those about Jesus' thousand-year reign,

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:32.259
will be completely fulfilled.

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:34.779
How refreshing it was to see the events

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:37.939
surrounding Jesus' birth portrayed accurately

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:40.939
in the good news according to Jesus.

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:44.300
The symposium, believe the truth about Jesus,

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.939
affirmed that what we believe about Jesus' identity,

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:51.980
his name and his birth are scriptural facts,

00:04:52.019 --> 00:04:54.540
not man-made traditions.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.139
And these truths have the power to change lives.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.220
I have become more positive

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.420
and my life is full of meaning.

00:05:06.019 --> 00:05:10.459
I absolutely love teaching the Bible to people.

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:13.180
As long as I have breath in me,

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.379
I'm gonna use it to share with others about Jehovah

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:23.379
and the Messiah, Jesus.

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:25.699
I like having a clear understanding

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:28.819
of why God sent Jesus to the earth,

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:30.339
what He was sent to do.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.699
Our faith was further strengthened

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:36.259
by seeing how the good news is increasing

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:39.379
and bearing fruit in all the world.

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:43.569
Do you recall these examples?

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:46.689
Where would we be without the good news?

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:54.949
The good news transforms lives.

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:59.709
It gives us meaning, mixes better people,

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.829
and even if it's difficult, if our health limits us,

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:09.990
if persecutors try to stop us,

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.199
if the changes our students need to make seem impossible,

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:22.160
Jehovah will help us to never give up

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:28.110
and sharing the good news.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.750
We also consider the power of the good news

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.829
to defeat bad news.

00:06:33.829 --> 00:06:38.069
That is, we saw how to use the things Jesus said and did

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:42.509
to counteract harmful gossip, excessive guilt,

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:45.430
negative news reports, and discouragement.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.629
The wrong view some people had toward us changed

00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:52.670
thanks to the power of the good news

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:58.449
and the peaceable attitude of our brothers and sisters.

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:01.089
He wants us to focus on the hope,

00:07:01.089 --> 00:07:03.689
the way she helped us that morning,

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:08.879
helped us focus completely on that hope.

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:13.000
Finally, let's review how the convention motivated us

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.439
to share the good news with others.

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:19.800
The symposium eager to declare the good news

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.240
show that each Christian has a responsibility to preach.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.399
Doing so is a personal expression of our faith

00:07:27.399 --> 00:07:28.920
and a part of our worship.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.480
Jehovah views our expressions of praise in the ministry

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.920
as sacrifices offered to him.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.000
What will help us to be effective ministers?

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.399
Being well prepared,

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:46.800
cultivating love for people

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.120
and being ready to speak wherever we are

00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:52.720
and being willing to expand our ministry

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.319
in whatever way Jehovah directs.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.399
If you are a young servant of Jehovah,

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:04.199
we urge you to take to heart the encouragement in the talk

00:08:04.199 --> 00:08:07.160
what will you do for the sake of the good news?

00:08:08.079 --> 00:08:11.439
Don't let this world set your goals

00:08:11.439 --> 00:08:14.439
and don't let yourself get sidetracked.

00:08:14.439 --> 00:08:18.959
Plan for a rich and satisfying life in the full-time ministry.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.920
Cultivate the skills needed to reach your goal.

00:08:24.079 --> 00:08:27.560
Like so many others, you'll find great joy

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.519
and have no regrets.

00:08:30.199 --> 00:08:35.200
As a result of a more intense relationship with Jehovah

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.559
and a deeper love for people in the ministry,

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:45.360
the ministry brings me more joy.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.480
I stopped focusing on myself

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.639
and started to think about others

00:08:50.639 --> 00:08:52.559
paying attention to what they needed.

00:08:53.679 --> 00:08:58.799
I feel like I'm spending every second of every day with Jehovah

00:08:58.799 --> 00:09:04.210
and that alone is an enormous gift for me.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:05.889
At the start of the convention,

00:09:05.889 --> 00:09:08.730
the chairman's address reminded us to be grateful

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:12.769
for the privilege of knowing and declaring the good news.

00:09:12.769 --> 00:09:15.169
We are working along with the angels

00:09:15.169 --> 00:09:17.809
under the oversight of Jesus Christ.

00:09:18.769 --> 00:09:22.409
The everlasting good news we declare is a message of hope

00:09:22.409 --> 00:09:25.769
that means life for those who respond favorably.

00:09:27.169 --> 00:09:29.370
What will happen when the good news has been preached

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:30.889
to Jehovah's satisfaction?

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:34.570
As today's convention theme reminds us

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:37.289
and then the end will come.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:40.649
Brothers and sisters,

00:09:40.649 --> 00:09:44.529
may this convention encourage you to make good use

00:09:44.529 --> 00:09:47.169
of the time remaining by zealously

00:09:47.169 --> 00:09:50.490
and boldly declaring the good news.
