00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:05.980
Well, my years in school were not easy.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.960
Samu teased me, others would laugh at me,

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.960
and still others would use hurtful words to me.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.960
I felt unloved and not needed.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.960
Sadly, my parents refused to take me to school.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.960
The best you can do is to get rid of this child.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.960
Just throw her away. That is what my father was told by his friend.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.710
Prejudice against people with albinism can be very cruel.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.710
Those who are targeted can be traumatized for life.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.710
Albinism is a genetic disorder in which one's eyes, skin or hair have little or no pigmentation.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.710
People with this condition struggle with vision problems.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.710
Extreme sensitivity to sunlight also puts them at a high risk for skin cancer.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:03.710
Beyond the physical challenges, they also have to deal with unwarranted social stigmas.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:10.709
In some African countries, people with albinism are even attacked or killed by those involved in its periodic rituals.

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:14.709
This leads them to live in isolation.

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:17.709
The sealer used to cry often and feel dull.

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:22.709
But since she has landed truth in the Bible, she has found comfort.

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:31.709
What helped me to endure all these trials was praying to Jehovah regularly and reading his word the Bible.

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:37.709
The first scripture that touches me deeply is Psalm 18 verse 25.

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:45.709
This scripture touches my heart to know that if I continue being loyal and righteous, Jehovah cannot forget,

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:48.709
he will also act in loyalty toward me.

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:51.709
James was the target of intense ridicule.

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:57.060
He isolated himself and felt worthless.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.060
The scripture I loved the most is John chapter 17 and verse 3.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:13.060
When I read this scripture, I was very happy because I realized that Jehovah values me or is concerned about me.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.060
So this showed me that Jehovah loves me.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.060
Judith has now spent 24 years in the full-time ministry.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.060
As a young girl, she was the target of vicious ridicule.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.060
She felt insecure and kept to herself.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.060
Revelation 21, 3 and 4.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.060
When I read this scripture, my faith is strengthened.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.060
I feel very happy.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:50.060
It's only through diligent, daily Bible reading and attending the meetings with our brothers, going out in the ministry.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.060
This makes me strong and fortifies my faith.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:01.060
Jehovah's people love and accept those who suffer from various conditions, including albinism.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:10.060
Tassila, James and Judith are among those who have experienced that brotherly love and acceptance in Jehovah's organization.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:17.060
There is a big difference between how people of the world and brothers view me.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:28.250
The love they have shown me has helped me prove that really, this is a spiritual family.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:36.250
When I am among my brothers and sisters, I do not see any difference or think that I have different skin.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:47.889
But I feel loved and happy. I do not lack anything.

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:50.889
This is my spiritual family.

00:03:50.889 --> 00:04:03.569
Whenever I am among brothers and sisters, I feel happy and protected because I show my true love.

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.569
Tassila serves as a zealous, regular pioneer.

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:13.569
She has overcome illiteracy and now knows how to cope with hostility and prejudice.

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:23.569
Despite all the negative things she faced in the past, she is now positive and cheerful and has her life and hope firmly based on Jehovah's promises.

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:28.569
James still has to deal with prejudice people from time to time.

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:31.569
But he does not allow that to make him bitter.

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:37.569
Rather, he chooses to respond in a kind manner.

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:41.569
Judith has experienced many disappointment in life.

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:46.569
But above all, she cherishes being one of Jehovah's people.

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:56.569
This overwhelming, impartial love shown by fellow brothers and sisters in the congregations is a source of support and help not only for individuals with albinism,

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:01.569
but for anyone who struggles with a challenging physical condition or disability.

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:09.569
Yes, mere man sees what appears to the eyes, but Jehovah sees into the heart.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.490
Those are the words found at 1 Samuel 16 and verse 7.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.490
And it was one of the verses we saw on the chalkboard in the video.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:30.490
Jehovah certainly saw into the hearts of James, Tassila, and Judith, and reassured them of his love through the congregation.
