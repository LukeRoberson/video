00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.449
I was the ringleader of a criminal gang.

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:16.449
We extorted money, put people out of business,

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:23.539
threatened them, dragged them away.

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:27.539
And they would handle for everything.

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.539
People were afraid of me, and I liked it that way.

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.820
I never forgave anybody.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.820
If someone wronged me, I would say,

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.820
throw one stone at me.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:47.630
I'll bury you in a mountain of rocks.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.630
In 1993, I was working for the police.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.630
They assigned me to gather information about a gang,

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.630
whose leader was Vladimir Akhov.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:02.380
One time, when committing a crime, they caught me at the scene.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:13.620
I swore revenge on everybody involved with my arrest.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:19.590
During interrogations, I did everything to humiliate Vladimir

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.590
and tried to break him up.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:31.090
We just hated each other.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.090
I told Volary, just remember.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.090
Sooner or later, I'm getting out of prison.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.090
And then, you're a dead man.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.090
I thought to myself, for a start,

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.090
I'm going to blow up his car.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.090
If he doesn't understand, then I'll just eliminate him.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.299
His threats sounded so serious that I started to fear for my life.

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.299
I decided to have my friends and acquaintances

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.299
make his life behind bars unbearable

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.299
and to make sure that he would never get out.

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:10.900
I saw that one of my cellmates had a pocket in New Testament.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.900
I asked him if I could read it.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.900
Seeing my interest in spiritual things,

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.900
someone gave me a watchtower magazine.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.900
When I started reading the magazine,

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.900
I realized that there are other people out there, real people.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.900
There's a totally different way of life to be had,

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.900
even now, and with such prospects.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.900
I was just stunned.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.900
Then I found another five magazines around the prison.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.900
I devoured them as well.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.900
And I became thoroughly convinced that I had found the truth.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.539
When my wife was first allowed to visit me,

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:51.539
I told her right away, I found the truth.

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:56.539
My wife made pretty fast progress and was baptized two years later.

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:59.539
Her support was invaluable.

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:02.539
She would visit me constantly encouraging me to be faithful

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:07.360
and remain loyal to God.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.360
In 1993, Jehovah's Witnesses visited me.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.360
I agreed to a Bible study,

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.360
but the truth didn't touch my heart.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.360
One time, Jehovah's Witnesses invited me to a gathering.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.360
And there they told me that Vladimir Alkhov,

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.360
that criminal, was about to get baptized

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.360
and become one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.360
I was cut to the heart.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.360
When I got home, I burst into tears.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.360
I realized that I had to make spiritual progress,

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.360
because if he and his circumstances could do it,

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.360
then I could do it.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.360
That very moment, I prayed for the first time in my life.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.360
I was released in October of 1997.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.360
After I was released, the brothers organized a gathering.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.360
They invited me to this gathering.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.360
I remember that as I was approaching the place,

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.360
I suddenly realized this is where I once conducted a search.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.360
And then, Valeri walks into the room.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:16.339
We just hugged each other and burst into tears.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:19.339
And I saw in his eyes a completely different look,

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:20.339
not like before.

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:22.339
It was a kind look.

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:24.339
It brought tears to my eyes.

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:27.339
It was like a big weight, was lifted from my chest.

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:33.000
My brother, we begged one another for forgiveness.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
On the 23rd of November, 1997,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:46.430
I was baptized together in the same pool as my new friend, Valeri.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.430
We really became the best of friends.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.430
And now we serve as elders in the same congregation.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.430
My wife and I often talk about what would have happened to us

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.430
if we had not started to study the Bible.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.430
Probably, we wouldn't even be alive by now.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.430
We've kept our family together.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.430
Even better, we now have a spiritual family in the Christian congregation.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.430
And my former enemy is now my brother and best friend.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:20.129
More importantly, we've developed a close relationship with Jehovah.

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:27.180
Only God is able to change the thinking of such bitter enemies as Valad and I were.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.180
And I eagerly look forward to the day when everything that divides people

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.180
will be gone forever.
