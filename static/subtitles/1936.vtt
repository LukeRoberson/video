00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.740
Long ago, Abraham sent his servant, Ellie Ezer,

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.740
to find a wife for his son, Isaac.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.739
He knew God's purpose required a woman of deep faith.

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:20.739
But who would be willing to leave their home

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:22.739
and travel into the unknown?

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:43.079
Mother, I'm back.

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.079
Hello, my dear.

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.390
Your cousin has been looking for you.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.390
And I'm over here.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.859
Rebecca, can you bring this to Father?

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:57.859
Yeah, is he still working?

00:00:57.859 --> 00:00:58.859
Still working.

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.880
Rebecca, I've been looking for you.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.880
Can I come with you?

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:11.310
Sure.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.310
Hello, Father.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.310
Life inside you needed this.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.310
Thank you.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:26.269
Can I help with anything?

00:01:26.269 --> 00:01:27.269
You can come with me to the well.

00:01:27.269 --> 00:01:37.239
But not today.

00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:39.239
We need your help making dinner.

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:47.540
Okay.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:02:00.250
Good day.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.250
Please.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.250
Give me a little sip of water.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.250
From your jar?

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.250
Drink, my lord.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.560
I will also water your camels until they are done drinking.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:55.060
Excuse me, my lord.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.060
Please tell me, who's daughter are you?

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:16.150
Is there any room in your father's house for us to spend the night?

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.150
I will not eat until I have told you what I have to say.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.150
Please, speak.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.150
I am Abraham's servant.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.150
And Jehovah has blessed my master very much.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.150
Sarah, the wife of my master,

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.150
bore a son to my master after she grew old.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.150
So my master made me swear, saying,

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.150
you will go to the house of my father, to my family.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.659
You must take a wife for my son.

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:58.580
But I said to my master, what if the woman is unwilling to come?

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.580
He said to me, Jehovah will send his angel with you

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.580
and will certainly give success to your journey.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.580
When I got to the spring today, I said, Jehovah,

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.580
the God of my master, Abraham.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.579
If you will make my journey successful,

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.579
here I am standing at a spring.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.920
When a young woman comes out to draw water,

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.920
I will say, please, let me drink a little water from your jar.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.920
And she will say to me, you take a drink

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.920
and I will also draw water for your camels.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.920
Let that woman be the one whom Jehovah has chosen

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.920
for the son of my master.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.920
Before I was finished speaking in my heart,

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:56.259
there was Rebecca coming out with her jar on her shoulder.

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:00.259
After that, I asked her, whose daughter are you?

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:04.259
To which she replied the daughter of Bethul.

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:07.259
So I put the ring on her nose

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:10.259
and the bracelets on her hands.

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:15.259
And now tell me, if you wish to show loyal love

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:19.259
and faithfulness to my master.

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:24.259
But if not, tell me

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:34.019
that I may proceed one way or the other.

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:37.259
This is from Jehovah.

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:40.259
Let her become a wife to the son of your master,

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:42.259
just as Jehovah has spoken.

00:05:42.259 --> 00:06:17.029
The negab is far.

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:18.029
When will you come back?

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:26.689
I can't you just stay here.

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:28.689
If you heard what my father said,

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:30.689
this is from Jehovah.

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:32.689
You can serve Jehovah here.

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:44.540
That is true.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.540
But you know, Jehovah will bless you

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.540
in ways you can't even imagine.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:57.300
We still have time together.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:07.560
Let's make the most of it.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:38.000
Why me?

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:56.899
Gather all the men, prepare the camels.

00:07:56.899 --> 00:07:57.899
We must leave soon.

00:07:57.899 --> 00:07:58.899
Right away.

00:07:58.899 --> 00:08:00.899
Why are you packing?

00:08:00.899 --> 00:08:05.220
Please send me off to my master.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.220
Let the young woman stay with us for ten more days.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.220
At least ten more days.

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.220
Then she can go.

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.220
Do not detain me.

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:17.220
Seeing that Jehovah has made my journey successful,

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:23.459
send me off in order that I may go to my master.

00:08:23.459 --> 00:08:31.750
Let us call the young woman and inquire of her.

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:34.750
Rebecca, at least we're wants to leave right now.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:09:15.980
Will you go with this man?

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:29.909
I'm willing to go.

00:09:29.909 --> 00:10:39.059
Rebecca, our sister,

00:10:39.059 --> 00:10:43.059
may you become thousands times ten thousand.

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:45.059
And let your offspring take possession of the gate

00:10:45.059 --> 00:10:46.059
of those who hate them.

00:10:46.059 --> 00:10:53.139
Praise Jehovah.

00:10:53.139 --> 00:10:55.139
Praise Jehovah.

00:10:56.139 --> 00:10:57.139
I'll miss you.

00:10:57.139 --> 00:11:23.980
Rebecca did not know what lay before her.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:27.980
And there is no record that she saw her family again.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:34.379
She showed faith when she left the comfort of home.

00:11:34.379 --> 00:11:40.720
Jehovah blessed her as an ancestor of the Messiah.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:46.830
Her faith is worthy of our imitation.
