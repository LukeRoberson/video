00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.040
Welcome to the program.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.039
This month, we'll take you to World Headquarters to visit one of the museums.

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:16.039
We'll learn about the many activities that are organized and directed by the governing body today.

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:22.039
Next, how can we protect ourselves from being lured into sin?

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.039
In this dramatization, a young brother learns how to make the right decision.

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.039
And how does the organization ensure that our brothers and sisters receive spiritual food?

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:41.039
In this example from Africa, we'll see how J.W. Broadcasting is distributed,

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:44.039
even when internet connections are slow.

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:51.039
This is the July 2019 program of J.W. Broadcasting.

00:00:51.039 --> 00:01:15.299
We'll begin by introducing you to two sisters who live in the United States.

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:22.299
Early on in their lives, they were exposed to two very different views of what a family should be like.

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:29.299
Still, they came to realize that while life may change, Jehovah doesn't.

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.299
This is my sister Laila.

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.299
This is my sister Mimi.

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:39.299
My sister Laila, she is very caring. I know that for sure.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.299
One thing that I appreciate about Mimi is that she has the self-sacrificing spirit.

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.299
We love our family.

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.769
What I love most about my mom is that she has a big heart.

00:01:54.769 --> 00:01:58.769
And I know that my dad really truly loves his family.

00:01:58.769 --> 00:02:03.769
Our sister Sophie always takes care of you, making sure you are okay.

00:02:03.769 --> 00:02:06.769
Our family is something that we would never want to replace.

00:02:06.769 --> 00:02:14.120
To us, it's a forever family.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.120
But it wasn't always like that.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.120
We haven't always been sisters.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.120
At a young age, I was already in the foster home,

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.120
and then Mimi became my foster sister.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.120
We were not treated as part of their family.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.120
We never knew what love felt like.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.120
There isn't a bedroom for us.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.120
Me and Laila were shared a couch.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.120
Our foster family, they would leave us by ourselves at home.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.120
And me and Laila had to take care of ourselves.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.120
And so we were very close together,

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.120
because we would talk to each other and just help each other out.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.120
When we would go to school, we didn't have school supplies,

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.120
so I would steal stuff.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.120
And we didn't have school uniforms.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.120
We had clothing that was dirty.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.120
I feel like in some way that with all those experience

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.120
kind of make me feel like I don't care.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.120
I didn't like authority figures and didn't really trust them.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.120
I was lost.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.120
I was confused.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.120
I just did whatever I could possibly to protect myself.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.120
We have experienced things that no children should go through.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.460
We found out there's a family who wanted to adopt us.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.460
I was 12 years old and I was nine years old.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.460
One thing that was tough for me was conversing.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.460
I didn't know any English

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.460
and it was hard for my parents to know how I felt

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.460
because I had a hard time expressing

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.460
if I was sad or scared.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.460
I had a difficult time to trust.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.460
But they showed us love and they hugged us

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.460
and just made us feel like home.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.460
As I got to know them better

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.460
and I got to see that they truly love me

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.460
and that they truly treat me like their daughter

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.459
helped me to develop love and trust.

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.459
The first time I saw my mom in debt praying at the dinner meal,

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:26.459
it was very new to me because I never knew that there was a God.

00:04:26.459 --> 00:04:30.459
I had some past experience with religion and I didn't like it.

00:04:30.459 --> 00:04:33.459
So whenever I saw my mom in debt praying,

00:04:33.459 --> 00:04:35.459
I was uncomfortable with it.

00:04:35.459 --> 00:04:42.459
They had to figure out a way to introduce their best friend Jehovah to us.

00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:46.459
They took us to this place called the Kingdom Hall.

00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:50.459
The first thing we felt was warmth and love.

00:04:50.459 --> 00:04:53.459
All these friends coming up and to say hi to us,

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:57.459
giving us hugs, just super loving towards us.

00:04:57.459 --> 00:05:03.459
Dad would give us a no pad and he told us to draw anything that you understand.

00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:05.459
And so that was our notes.

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:07.459
We would just draw pictures.

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:12.459
They would pray with us, teaching us how to pray specifically

00:05:12.459 --> 00:05:16.459
and see how Jehovah can insert our prayer.

00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:20.459
We would eat breakfast every day together and do daily texts.

00:05:20.459 --> 00:05:24.459
We would do re-enact Bible stories

00:05:24.459 --> 00:05:27.459
and prepare for meetings.

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:34.129
The simplified washroom came out and it really helped us so much.

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:39.129
I was able to really learn more about Jehovah and understand it.

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:43.129
And that helped me to give more comments and draw closer to Jehovah.

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:48.129
A big change for me was strain the 2014 International Convention.

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:53.129
Just seeing love in the unity between brothers and sisters touched my heart.

00:05:53.129 --> 00:06:00.129
That also helped me to progress towards making the decision of getting baptized.

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:05.129
Going on service more, I think it really helped me to draw closer to Jehovah

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:07.129
and making the Kingdom feel real to me.

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:11.129
And so that's why I wanted to get baptized.

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:16.129
After I graduated high school, I started to pioneer.

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:20.129
It's one way to show my love to Jehovah.

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:22.129
I used to just take care of myself.

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:26.129
But I learned to take care of others and to think of others first.

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:31.129
For us young ones, we should appreciate every moment that we have with our parents.

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:34.129
Your parents are the best friend that you could ever have.

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:40.129
Going on service wasn't easy for me at first because I'm actually a very shy person.

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:45.129
But I decided to rely on Jehovah and started pioneering.

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:48.129
And just recently, I started commuting to Bethel.

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:55.819
One day a week, the important quality that Jehovah have told me is love.

00:06:55.819 --> 00:07:00.819
I felt that love from my family, from Jehovah, from my friends.

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:03.819
I learned that it's all good to love people.

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:05.819
And that's what you're supposed to do.

00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:08.819
You love people and take care of people.

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:12.819
And I feel like my life is more satisfying and meaningful.

00:07:12.819 --> 00:07:17.819
When I meditate and think about what Jehovah has done for me and Lele,

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:19.819
I don't have to be afraid.

00:07:19.819 --> 00:07:24.819
Jehovah is my secure refuge because life's may change, but Jehovah does not change.

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:32.060
The love and unity of the brothers stood out to Lele and Mimi

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:36.060
and helped them draw closer to Jehovah.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:42.060
For a Bible student to progress the baptism, he or she would need to develop those very qualities

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.060
which Lele and Mimi did.

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:52.060
But there are many additional aspects of our personality that we as Christians need to maintain.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:57.060
One of the most underrated qualities in today's world is modesty.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:02.060
In fact, the world encourages the exact opposite of modesty.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:06.060
The world says that you are the most important person.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.060
You should promote yourself.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.060
You have no limits.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:14.060
You have the right to be anything you want to be.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:21.060
As we'll see, the world's thinking is completely backwards and for several reasons.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:27.060
Really, modesty is a quality that stems from everything that is good.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:33.059
Our theme scripture for this discussion is Micah 6 and verse 8.

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:38.059
He has told you what is good and what is Jehovah requiring of you

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:47.059
only to exercise justice to cherish loyalty and to walk in modesty with your God.

00:08:47.059 --> 00:08:52.059
Notice that modesty is one of the key aspects of what is good.

00:08:52.059 --> 00:08:57.059
To help us understand why, let's discuss three questions.

00:08:57.059 --> 00:08:59.059
What is modesty?

00:08:59.059 --> 00:09:02.059
Why do we want to have this quality?

00:09:02.059 --> 00:09:04.059
How can we cultivate it?

00:09:04.059 --> 00:09:07.059
First, what is modesty?

00:09:07.059 --> 00:09:12.059
Basically, it's an awareness of our limitations.

00:09:12.059 --> 00:09:17.059
Of course, we often link modesty with appropriate dress and grooming.

00:09:17.059 --> 00:09:20.059
But much more is involved.

00:09:20.059 --> 00:09:22.059
How do we know?

00:09:22.059 --> 00:09:26.059
Consider what we read at Proverbs 11 and verse 2.

00:09:26.059 --> 00:09:30.059
When presumptuousness comes, dishonor will follow.

00:09:30.059 --> 00:09:34.059
But wisdom is with the modest ones.

00:09:34.059 --> 00:09:40.059
Notice that modesty is contrasted with the negative quality, presumptuousness.

00:09:40.059 --> 00:09:45.059
A presumptuous person runs ahead without the authority to do so.

00:09:45.059 --> 00:09:48.059
He or she ignores proper boundaries and limitations.

00:09:48.059 --> 00:09:55.059
That kind of attitude often leads to foolish mistakes, a bad reputation with fellow humans.

00:09:55.059 --> 00:10:01.059
And above all, it can cause a person to lose God's favor.

00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:04.059
For example, we might think of King Saul.

00:10:04.059 --> 00:10:10.059
Although he started out as a modest young man, in time he became presumptuous.

00:10:10.059 --> 00:10:18.059
He even went so far as to offer up a burnt sacrifice, even though he was not authorized to do so.

00:10:18.059 --> 00:10:25.059
As a result, Saul lost Jehovah's favor and eventually the kingship.

00:10:25.059 --> 00:10:31.059
In Saul's case, presumptuousness definitely led to dishonor.

00:10:31.059 --> 00:10:39.059
On the other hand, a wise and modest person recognizes his limitations and works within them.

00:10:39.059 --> 00:10:43.059
Why is modesty the course of wisdom?

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:46.059
This brings us to our second main point.

00:10:46.059 --> 00:10:49.059
Why do we want to have this quality?

00:10:49.059 --> 00:10:57.059
The foremost reason is that modesty is essential to pleasing our Heavenly Father Jehovah.

00:10:57.059 --> 00:11:05.059
Although we don't speak of Jehovah as being modest, even he works within certain limitations that he's imposed on himself.

00:11:05.059 --> 00:11:13.059
He teaches us by example how to demonstrate this quality, even though it's not one that he needs to display.

00:11:14.059 --> 00:11:21.059
Why can we say that Jehovah imposes limitations on himself? Consider just one example.

00:11:21.059 --> 00:11:26.059
He'll never violate the gift of free will that he's granted us.

00:11:26.059 --> 00:11:33.059
Jehovah will never force us to serve him, even though of course he has the power to do so.

00:11:33.059 --> 00:11:42.059
Aren't we grateful that he allows us to serve him because we choose to out of love and not because we are forced to?

00:11:42.059 --> 00:11:47.059
Jehovah teaches us to display modesty in other ways as well.

00:11:47.059 --> 00:11:57.059
For example, we might think of how he listened patiently as Abraham voiced his concerns about Jehovah's purpose to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah.

00:11:57.059 --> 00:12:06.059
Or how Jehovah invited the angels to suggest ways to Fuehab and then authorized one of their suggestions to be carried out.

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:09.059
What's the lesson for us?

00:12:09.059 --> 00:12:21.059
If Jehovah who doesn't need input or help from anyone patiently listens and delegates, how much more should we do so, especially since we're all so imperfect and limited?

00:12:21.059 --> 00:12:29.059
Are you a family head or an elder in the congregation, or do you have another responsible position in the organization?

00:12:29.059 --> 00:12:48.059
If so, you can imitate Jehovah by not micromanaging others, be willing to delegate tasks to them and listen to their suggestions, imitate Jehovah's example of dignifying others and wanting to help them succeed.

00:12:48.059 --> 00:13:03.059
Besides pleasing Jehovah, we have other good reasons to be modest. Modesty helps us to be joyful, how so, by going hand in hand with a related quality gratitude.

00:13:03.059 --> 00:13:13.059
A faithful brother who worked in the writing department for some 50 years was fond of saying, only a grateful person can be happy.

00:13:13.059 --> 00:13:22.059
If we're modestly aware of our limitations, we'll be grateful and happy for the help that we receive from others.

00:13:22.059 --> 00:13:28.059
For example, think of the leper who returned to thank Jesus for healing him.

00:13:28.059 --> 00:13:38.059
This man realized his limitations. He was very thankful that Jesus had done something for him that he could never have done on his own.

00:13:39.059 --> 00:13:56.059
Another reason to cultivate modesty is that it promotes good relationships with others. Let's face it, people aren't usually drawn to those who think, if I want something done right, I have to do it myself.

00:13:56.059 --> 00:14:05.059
But they usually appreciate it when they're shown that we have confidence in them. This in turn draws them to us.

00:14:05.059 --> 00:14:13.059
Another way that modesty promotes good relationships is that it helps us to avoid comparing ourselves to others.

00:14:13.059 --> 00:14:19.059
Comparing ourselves to others is always a dangerous road to navigate.

00:14:19.059 --> 00:14:34.059
Just think, for example, of Jesus' apostles who argued many times over who was the greatest or Joseph's brothers and the terrible things they did because of being jealous of Joseph.

00:14:34.059 --> 00:14:41.059
A modest person doesn't obsess over his perceived rank in comparison with others.

00:14:42.059 --> 00:14:54.059
In this regard, we can remember the good example of Moses. How did he react when Jehovah enabled some of his fellow Israelites to begin acting as prophets alongside him?

00:14:54.059 --> 00:15:00.059
Moses rejoiced, saying that he wished all of Jehovah's people were prophets.

00:15:00.059 --> 00:15:06.059
Moses didn't feel that he was the only one who should have such a privilege.

00:15:06.059 --> 00:15:21.059
Finally, modesty promotes good relationships with others because it prevents us from bragging about our accomplishments or drawing undue attention to ourselves which could stir up resentment in others.

00:15:21.059 --> 00:15:33.059
So now we know what modesty is and why we want to have it. This brings us to our third main point. How can we cultivate this beautiful quality?

00:15:33.059 --> 00:15:42.059
One thing we can do is to read and meditate on Bible examples both good and bad, such as those we just discussed.

00:15:42.059 --> 00:15:50.059
Other Bible examples include Daniel, who modestly didn't take credit for the interpretation of King Nebuchadnezzar's dream.

00:15:50.059 --> 00:15:52.059
The lesson for us?

00:15:52.059 --> 00:16:02.059
If we're privileged to have a teaching assignment or we enjoy a measure of success in the ministry, we want to give all the glory to Jehovah.

00:16:02.059 --> 00:16:08.059
We should modestly recognize that we couldn't do these things without his help.

00:16:08.059 --> 00:16:16.059
We can also study the example of Jesus, who didn't even think of trying to grasp for more authority than Jehovah had granted him.

00:16:16.059 --> 00:16:27.059
Philippians 2 and verse 6 tells us, he gave no consideration to a seizure, namely, that he should be equal to God.

00:16:27.059 --> 00:16:38.059
Consider how Jesus responded when his disciples James and John approached him with their mother and asked for a privilege that was beyond his authority to grant them.

00:16:39.059 --> 00:16:47.059
Jesus modestly acknowledged that only Jehovah could decide who would sit at his right and left hand in the kingdom.

00:16:47.059 --> 00:16:51.059
Jesus respected his limitations.

00:16:51.059 --> 00:16:55.059
What are some other ways we can cultivate modesty?

00:16:55.059 --> 00:17:01.059
One is to apply the Bible's counsel founded 1 Corinthians 4 verse 6.

00:17:01.059 --> 00:17:04.059
Do not go beyond the things that are written.

00:17:05.059 --> 00:17:09.059
This refers primarily to the things written in God's Word.

00:17:09.059 --> 00:17:16.059
By extension, the principal also applies to the scriptural direction that we receive from our publications.

00:17:16.059 --> 00:17:25.059
When asked for advice, we would never want to impose our own opinion or simply give an answer off the top of our head.

00:17:25.059 --> 00:17:33.059
Rather, we want to direct attention to the counsel found in the Bible and Bible-based publications.

00:17:33.059 --> 00:17:44.059
Another way we can cultivate modesty is by asking for frank comments from a trusted friend as to whether or not we have a reputation for being modest.

00:17:44.059 --> 00:17:54.059
In this regard, we remember the Bible principle, as iron, sharpens iron, so one man sharpens his friend.

00:17:55.059 --> 00:18:03.059
If someone is willing to offer kind observations about how we can improve, we wouldn't want to bristle at the comments.

00:18:03.059 --> 00:18:12.059
Granted, it may sting our pride to hear such honest feedback, but don't we all need to hear these things from time to time?

00:18:12.059 --> 00:18:17.059
As imperfect humans, each one of us has blind spots as it were.

00:18:17.059 --> 00:18:21.059
It's hard to see ourselves the way others see us.

00:18:21.059 --> 00:18:30.059
Remember, we can work to improve our Christian personality, but only if we know the areas that could use some improvement.

00:18:30.059 --> 00:18:33.059
We can't change what we don't see.

00:18:33.059 --> 00:18:35.059
A word of caution.

00:18:35.059 --> 00:18:38.059
We want to be aware of false modesty.

00:18:38.059 --> 00:18:45.059
Remember that it's not about simply appearing modest, but actually being modest at heart.

00:18:46.059 --> 00:18:52.059
To help us examine ourselves, we might meditate on questions like these.

00:18:52.059 --> 00:18:58.059
When I receive advice or counsel, how do I really feel about it at heart?

00:18:58.059 --> 00:19:06.059
Does my internal reaction depend on whether the person giving it has less or more experience or authority than I do?

00:19:06.059 --> 00:19:12.059
Am I willing to accept valid suggestions regardless of who offers them?

00:19:12.059 --> 00:19:18.059
A final way we can develop true modesty is to ask Jehovah to help us.

00:19:18.059 --> 00:19:23.059
We know what James 1 verse 17 says.

00:19:23.059 --> 00:19:32.059
Every good gift and every perfect present is from above, coming down from the Father of the celestial lights.

00:19:32.059 --> 00:19:41.059
Since modesty is one of Jehovah's good gifts to us, we can be sure that if we pray to Jehovah and ask him to help us cultivate this quality,

00:19:41.059 --> 00:19:45.059
he'll answer our sincere prayers.

00:19:45.059 --> 00:19:48.059
In review, what is modesty?

00:19:48.059 --> 00:19:52.059
It's a proper recognition of our limitations.

00:19:52.059 --> 00:19:55.059
Why do we want to have this quality?

00:19:55.059 --> 00:20:03.059
Because it pleases Jehovah, it promotes good relationships with others, and it adds to our joy.

00:20:03.059 --> 00:20:06.059
How can we cultivate modesty?

00:20:06.059 --> 00:20:08.059
There are many ways.

00:20:08.059 --> 00:20:16.059
We can meditate on Bible examples both good and bad, and then apply the lessons in our own life.

00:20:16.059 --> 00:20:20.059
We should apply the counsel to not go beyond the things written.

00:20:20.059 --> 00:20:32.059
We can ask others for honest feedback on how we're doing and showing this quality, and above all, we can pray to Jehovah and ask him to help us develop it more fully.

00:20:33.059 --> 00:20:44.059
When we think of all the positive ways that modesty benefits ourselves and others, wouldn't you agree that it truly is a quality that comes from what is good?

00:20:44.059 --> 00:20:48.059
Modesty can also protect us from Satan's schemes.

00:20:48.059 --> 00:20:54.059
In this dramatization, a brother's modesty helped him to make the right decision.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:12.640
Mum's been working hard lately, but I wish she worked harder for Jehovah.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:24.980
I try to help out where I can.

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:29.980
Oh, by the way, I'm Jin.

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:32.980
Every day starts the same.

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:37.099
I grab a drink of water.

00:21:37.099 --> 00:21:39.099
I say hi to Jin.

00:21:39.099 --> 00:21:42.099
He's in my congregation.

00:21:42.099 --> 00:21:46.099
And then, there's Mi Kyung.

00:21:47.099 --> 00:21:49.099
Okay, here we go.

00:21:49.099 --> 00:21:53.099
I say hello. She says something clever.

00:21:53.099 --> 00:21:58.099
I try to leave, so this is different.

00:21:58.099 --> 00:22:05.490
She's having trouble in math and needs my help.

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:15.769
I don't want to be rude, but if I help her with her homework, how far could the relationship develop?

00:22:15.769 --> 00:22:18.769
How do you say no to a girl like her?

00:22:18.769 --> 00:22:54.000
Why can't I get her out of my head?

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:18.380
Things are always better when Uncle and Auntie are around.

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:32.849
Even Mum makes sure she's home for dinner and broadcast night.

00:23:32.849 --> 00:23:35.849
Uncle wants to work together in service this weekend.

00:23:35.849 --> 00:23:38.849
Maybe that will help clear my head.

00:23:38.849 --> 00:24:12.220
Jehovah must be disappointed in me.

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:16.880
I couldn't take it anymore.

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:21.880
It was difficult, but I told Uncle everything.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:29.880
I felt guilty that I knew I shouldn't, but I liked the attention.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:35.190
We read Genesis 39 7 through 12.

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:43.440
I knew the account about Potterfus' wife, but he mentioned something I hadn't thought of before.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:53.440
He told Potterfus' wife, how could I commit this great badness and actually sin against God?

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:57.440
But why did Joseph have to flee?

00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:09.579
Joseph fought her every day, but she wasn't going to give up.

00:25:09.579 --> 00:25:15.579
In her mind, it wasn't a question of if, but when?

00:25:15.579 --> 00:25:18.579
There came a point where he had to flee.

00:25:18.579 --> 00:25:29.670
I explained why I was ending the relationship, but she would not give up.

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:43.359
You know the last thing she said to me?

00:25:44.359 --> 00:25:48.359
That I was a coward, but she's wrong.

00:25:48.359 --> 00:25:53.359
You're never a coward if you run to Jehovah.

00:25:53.359 --> 00:25:59.359
Our young brother saw that dating an unbeliever would put him in harm's way.

00:25:59.359 --> 00:26:07.359
He was reminded that getting involved with someone who doesn't share Jehovah's values could eventually lead to sin.

00:26:07.359 --> 00:26:12.359
Having modesty protected him from such dire consequences.

00:26:12.359 --> 00:26:18.359
By his decision, we could see our young brother's faith in action.

00:26:18.359 --> 00:26:25.359
Faith in action is also the name of one of the museums at our World Headquarters in Warwick, New York.

00:26:25.359 --> 00:26:28.359
Have you had an opportunity to visit?

00:26:28.359 --> 00:26:32.359
If not, we'd like to take you there right now.

00:26:32.359 --> 00:26:36.359
And even if you have visited, you'll enjoy these reminders.

00:26:36.359 --> 00:27:10.329
Welcome to the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses at Warwick, New York.

00:27:10.329 --> 00:27:15.329
As Jehovah's people, we are multicultural and multilingual.

00:27:15.329 --> 00:27:25.329
And as the artwork here emphasizes, our focus is on our commission to preach the good news to people of all nations.

00:27:25.329 --> 00:27:29.329
So what are we doing today as an organization?

00:27:29.329 --> 00:27:34.329
How did we get here? And what's our main tool for this great work?

00:27:34.329 --> 00:27:39.329
We invite you to come to our museums to find out.

00:27:39.329 --> 00:27:45.329
We have three museums here at Warwick, all funded by voluntary donations.

00:27:45.329 --> 00:27:49.329
Each of them is alive with stories.

00:27:49.329 --> 00:27:55.329
Upstairs on the second floor is the museum, Faith in Action.

00:27:55.329 --> 00:28:01.329
There we'll see the very latest on what's being done by Jehovah's organization.

00:28:01.329 --> 00:28:07.329
Also on the second floor is the museum, A People for Jehovah's Day.

00:28:07.329 --> 00:28:11.329
It takes us on an exciting journey back in time.

00:28:11.329 --> 00:28:15.329
And downstairs, we have the Bible Museum.

00:28:15.329 --> 00:28:21.329
There we'll get to see up close a spiritual treasure chest.

00:28:21.329 --> 00:28:32.329
When you tour the museums, you'll notice that they were designed to be not passive but interactive so that you can put yourself in the experience.

00:28:32.329 --> 00:28:35.329
So with that preview, let's take the tour.

00:28:35.329 --> 00:28:46.250
This is the launching point to the Faith in Action Museum.

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:50.250
Note that important descriptive word, action.

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:57.250
What activities or actions are being organized and directed by the governing body today?

00:28:57.250 --> 00:29:03.250
This display equates you right away with the work of the governing body committees.

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:14.250
Each committee has specific responsibilities, but as you take the tour, notice how the committees work together to accomplish their goals.

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:19.250
The Faith in Action Museum is divided into four galleries.

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:27.250
Show love, meet together, take in spiritual food and make disciples.

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:34.250
As you walk through the galleries, notice how each of them is connected by a JW Blue Ribbon.

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:38.250
So if you get lost, just follow the Blue Ribbon.

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:42.720
This is the show love gallery.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:52.720
Here you'll learn how the governing body helps God's people to have love among themselves as Jesus commanded at John 1335.

00:29:52.720 --> 00:30:00.720
For example, how do the brothers at headquarters respond to needs that arise when a disaster strikes?

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:10.720
When things like natural disasters, terrorist attacks, or civil unrest occur, the coordinators committee directs relief efforts.

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:17.720
They in turn communicate with the branch committee that oversees the affected area.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:27.720
Usually within 48 hours, a report of what's occurred and what's being done to help our brothers is compiled and sent to headquarters.

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:35.720
That report may be the basis for informing the brotherhood through an article on JW.org.

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:39.720
There's another way that love is shown to Jehovah's people.

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:48.720
Schools, such schools as the School for Congregation Elders and the School for Circuit Overseers and their wives.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:55.720
These have been very effective in training brothers to shepherd the congregations lovingly.

00:30:55.720 --> 00:31:04.720
The Teaching Committee is responsible for the curriculum, while the Service Committee arranges for the selection of the students.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:07.720
This is the Meet Together Gallery.

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:20.720
Here you'll learn how the governing body is helping God's people to meet together, to incite to love and find works as directed at Hebrews 1024 and 25.

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:24.720
How is the headquarters staff at Warwick filling that need?

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:32.720
Because we keep growing, there is an ongoing need to build new kingdoms and to renovate existing ones.

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:41.720
The Publishing Committee of the governing body directs where kingdom halls will be built and makes funds available to the branches.

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:50.720
The Publishing Committee works closely with the branch office and its local design construction department carries out the work.

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:54.720
But where do these hardworking brothers and sisters come from?

00:31:55.720 --> 00:32:04.720
The personnel committee appoints all construction servants for assignments in their home country or in a foreign land.

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:10.720
Have you worked on a Theocratic building project? Take our survey and let us know.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:20.720
Some kingdom halls are located in areas where there is little or no electricity, but that doesn't stop us from meeting together.

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:28.720
The Publishing Committee has arranged for a custom built portable sound system to be used in these areas.

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:36.720
The Unity Player has a battery that can be recharged by its solar panel or with a built-in hand crank.

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:44.720
It's a wonderful provision that helps our brothers and sisters benefit more from their congregation meetings.

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:53.720
This is the Taken Spiritual Food Gallery. Can you guess what design we used? That's right, a dining table.

00:32:53.720 --> 00:33:03.720
Here you'll learn how the governing body fulfills the Scriptural Commission at Luke 1242 to feed God's people spiritually.

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:14.720
To accomplish this, millions of Bibles, Books and other publications need to be prepared, translated and printed.

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:20.720
In addition, a regular flow of material is released online.

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:30.720
Translators around the world keep in close contact with translation services, a headquarters department that supervise by the Writing Committee.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:37.720
Do you have a favorite publication? Much more is involved in just the writing.

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:45.720
The section from Start to Finish outlines 11 steps that are taken to produce the final product.

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:48.720
What about our online spiritual food?

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:54.720
Each month, we look forward to a new JW Broadcasting Program.

00:33:55.720 --> 00:34:06.720
Once the Teaching Committee approves a video idea, audio video services researches the subject and prepares a script for final approval.

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:12.719
Approved scripts and storyboards are assigned to video production teams around the world.

00:34:12.719 --> 00:34:18.000
This gives our videos an international flavor.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
Well, we've come to our final gallery, Make Disciples.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:36.000
Here, you'll learn how the governing body is helping us to fulfill the Scriptural Commission at Matthew 2819 to make disciples of people of all nations baptizing them.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:45.000
The command to preach can be daunting, especially in certain lands. So, how are we meeting that challenge?

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:59.000
The service committee oversees the preaching work worldwide. They help all to have a share according to their ability, some as congregation publishers, others as full-time evangelizers.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:07.000
Additionally, special preaching campaigns and public witnessing have resulted in many new Bible studies.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:14.000
At times, though, our religious freedom is opposed by secular authorities.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:24.000
So, the coordinators committee supervises the World Headquarters Legal Department. Many courts have handed down favorable decisions.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:31.000
Still, we must continue to defend our right to preach the good news.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000
Our online tools are also a huge help in making disciples.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:45.000
This counter shows the average rate at which people worldwide are logging on to JW.org.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:51.000
Each day, some 250 Bible studies are requested online.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000
Schools also help us to make disciples.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:03.000
We have the Pioneer Service School, the School for Kingdom Evangelizers, and Gilead School.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000
Have you attended one of these schools? Let us know.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:16.409
Well, as we come to the end of our tour, we hope you enjoyed some highlights from this Faith in Action Museum.

00:36:16.409 --> 00:36:25.409
What we've seen here reminds us that now and always, Jehovah's people are a people of faith.

00:36:25.409 --> 00:36:28.409
Faith in Action.

00:36:28.409 --> 00:36:38.300
As Brother Sanderson highlighted, the organization's actions speak volumes of the faith of Jehovah's people.

00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:43.300
And we wanted to share one more example of faith in action.

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:51.300
In Africa, a new provision has made it easier for our brothers and sisters to access spiritual food.

00:36:51.300 --> 00:37:03.369
Some of the electronic information that had been translated and provided for the brothers in Sub-to-Hern Africa was essentially unavailable to them.

00:37:03.369 --> 00:37:11.369
There are many areas in Mozambique that do not have internet access, and in some parts there is no cell phone coverage.

00:37:11.369 --> 00:37:21.369
So we started investigating what it would take to have a 24-hour day, 7-day-a-week satellite channel dedicated to JW Broadcasting.

00:37:22.369 --> 00:37:31.619
When the announcement was made to a congregation about the JW satellite channel, our brothers and sisters were very happy about the announcement.

00:37:31.619 --> 00:37:38.619
Our organization has a lot of experience distributing video via the internet, but to distribute it on the satellite was entirely new.

00:37:38.619 --> 00:37:40.619
So we had to do a lot of research.

00:37:40.619 --> 00:37:43.619
We don't have our own satellite up in space.

00:37:43.619 --> 00:37:49.619
We ran a channel on a satellite that covers Sub-Saharan Africa.

00:37:49.619 --> 00:37:53.619
What is required from the brothers is to have a satellite dish and a decoder.

00:37:53.619 --> 00:37:57.619
This will allow them to view the channel with no additional cost.

00:38:05.619 --> 00:38:08.619
The brothers that are invited to come here are trained.

00:38:08.619 --> 00:38:11.619
First, how to set up the dish.

00:38:11.619 --> 00:38:18.619
Second, how to set up the decoder and learn how to adjust the dish properly so that it works well.

00:38:18.619 --> 00:38:25.619
Then we teach them how to record the programs, with the goal that they can watch it with the brothers and sisters in the congregation.

00:38:27.619 --> 00:38:33.619
Our satellite channel is set up to transmit one video track and 16 audio tracks.

00:38:33.619 --> 00:38:37.619
This gives us the ability to broadcast our videos in 16 languages.

00:38:37.619 --> 00:38:46.619
We consulted with the Translation Services Department and so these are the 16 languages that give us the greatest audience of our brothers in Africa.

00:38:46.619 --> 00:38:57.619
We wrote new software that takes any new video that comes to JW Broadcasting and mixes the 16 languages of video together into a single video file and delivers that to our satellite provider.

00:38:57.619 --> 00:39:06.619
The governing body lovingly approved for the rental cost of the satellite channel to be covered from contributions to the worldwide work.

00:39:06.619 --> 00:39:11.619
So there's no expense to the brothers in Africa to receive the programs.

00:39:12.619 --> 00:39:24.619
We broadcast over a single satellite channel for most of our needs, but occasionally we use a second channel when we broadcast live events like conventions or branch visits.

00:39:24.619 --> 00:39:31.619
When the representative of World Headquarters gives his talk from Bethel, it is transmitted to us live through the satellite.

00:39:31.619 --> 00:39:36.619
This makes us feel like we are right there at Bethel. We are very happy.

00:39:36.619 --> 00:39:45.619
The most recent live event that we broadcast originated in France. It was the release of the revised edition of the New World Translations.

00:39:45.619 --> 00:39:57.619
This was very exciting. And brothers and sisters that attended conventions in 10 different branch territories in Africa were able to tie into this broadcast that originated in France using the satellite.

00:39:58.619 --> 00:40:08.619
In our branch territory, we were arranging for all new or remodel kingdom halls to have satellite equipment as part of the standard audio video package.

00:40:08.619 --> 00:40:19.539
We were very happy when we received the satellite dish because we could see that now we are really close to the brothers on the governing body.

00:40:19.539 --> 00:40:24.539
The satellite channel is excellent. This provision touches our hearts.

00:40:25.539 --> 00:40:34.539
Deaf all over the country benefited from the special talk as it was interpreted in Malawi sign language, showing that Jehovah truly loves deaf people.

00:40:34.539 --> 00:40:37.539
And this helps us strengthen our relationship with Jehovah.

00:40:37.539 --> 00:40:48.539
Our congregation is in our refugee camp. As a refugee you can miss many things, physical things I mean. We don't miss any spiritual food.

00:40:49.539 --> 00:41:00.539
We hope and pray that access to the JW satellite feed becomes available to as many of our brothers and sisters as possible in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:41:00.539 --> 00:41:10.539
This is a very loving arrangement from the fifth and discreet slave because it enables millions in Africa to benefit from the satellite arrangement.

00:41:10.539 --> 00:41:21.539
To receive the food from the fifth or slave at the right time, at the right location, in the right language, what an amazing arrangement from the fifth or slave.

00:41:21.539 --> 00:41:35.539
As we could see, the organization prioritizes the needs of Jehovah's people. And as it does, it finds a modest solution that can best serve the needs of as many people as possible.

00:41:35.539 --> 00:41:50.539
As we discussed earlier in the program, modesty is equally important on an individual level. But there are times when we have to ask ourselves if we're confusing modesty with our own imperfect view of ourselves.

00:41:51.539 --> 00:42:07.539
Meet Juan Cayul from Chile. He's of the Mapuche tribe, a tribe which has faced discrimination over the years. Because of the discrimination, some may be reluctant to use their language Mapudangun in public.

00:42:07.539 --> 00:42:14.539
This became a challenge for Juan since he wanted to give his best in the ministry for Jehovah.

00:42:14.539 --> 00:42:24.539
Mapudangun means the speech of my land. It's a beautiful and expressive language, and it's the language of my heart.

00:42:24.539 --> 00:42:31.539
When I was 12 years old, I went to live with my grandfather and my uncle's family so I could study it in nearby school.

00:42:31.539 --> 00:42:47.380
My cousins spoke Mapudangun a lot, which made me really happy. When I saw that some of my classmates didn't understand their schoolwork, especially in math class, I would try to help them out.

00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:56.619
That's when I started to think about becoming a math teacher so I could really help others.

00:42:56.619 --> 00:43:05.619
But the head teacher told me that because I was speaking Mapudangun and because I was helping my classmates, she was going to lower my grades.

00:43:05.619 --> 00:43:18.619
When my father saw my grades, he was furious. He accused me of being lazy and not studying. He withdrew me from school and I went back home to Trumin.

00:43:18.619 --> 00:43:27.539
My dream of becoming a teacher was shattered because my dad had suffered so much as a victim of discrimination.

00:43:27.539 --> 00:43:42.510
He told us we were not to speak Mapudangun. When I think about everything that happened, it makes me very sad.

00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:53.420
Years later, I met Sylvia, who was Mapucci like me. She proved to be a sensitive and loving person.

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:58.420
We spoke Mapudangun together and that helped her leave the bitterness I felt in my heart.

00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:09.500
Sometime later, I learned about someone else who made me feel loved and valued Jehovah. That changed my life.

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:13.500
All my pain disappeared once I got to know Jehovah.

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:19.099
My wife and I studied the Bible with the witnesses in Spanish.

00:44:19.099 --> 00:44:25.099
And so, when I started to preach and teach, I used Spanish too.

00:44:26.099 --> 00:44:33.099
One day, I was out in service and as we approached a house, an elderly Mapucci woman came to the door.

00:44:33.099 --> 00:44:46.590
She was scared. So straight away, I greeted her in my room. She invited us inside and spoke with us.

00:44:46.590 --> 00:45:00.340
That was the first time I had spoken about Jehovah in my mother tongue. On her way back, I was deep in thought, praying to Jehovah about how to help the Mapucci people.

00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:06.650
Many years passed before I saw an answer to my prayers.

00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:18.650
Then one day after the meeting, I received an invitation to be a speaker at the first assembly to include talks in Mapudangun.

00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:25.650
But I didn't want to accept the assignment. I felt worthless because of all the discrimination I had endured.

00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:35.650
So, I prayed again and again to Jehovah and began to meditate a lot.

00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:42.650
Jehovah was now giving me an answer to my prayers. He sees our true value.

00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:16.130
I was so happy, so very healthy. I understood that Jehovah loved me and cared for me and that he would continue to help me.

00:46:16.130 --> 00:46:22.130
In just a few years, not one, but several Mapudangun congregations were formed.

00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:29.130
And now my wife and I, as well as our two children, serve in Mapudangun language congregations.

00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:34.500
I've been assisting with Mapudangun translation for more than seven years now.

00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:44.489
When I tell the brothers and sisters who work with me at the translation office about my childhood dream of becoming a teacher, they tell me,

00:46:44.489 --> 00:46:52.989
you're our teacher now. I want to say to my brothers and sisters around the world, don't put yourselves down.

00:46:52.989 --> 00:46:57.989
You're precious. You're precious to Jehovah. He will always help you.

00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:09.150
I want to say to my brothers and sisters around the world, don't put yourselves down.

00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:14.150
I want to say to my brothers and sisters around the world, don't put yourselves down.

00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:18.150
I want to say to my brothers and sisters around the world, don't put yourselves down.

00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:28.050
It took courage for Juan to overcome his fear of discrimination.

00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:35.050
In our lives as Christians, we can imitate Juan's example of courage in many different ways.

00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:40.050
When we do, let's remember the words of Joshua 1, 9.

00:47:40.050 --> 00:47:45.050
Have I not commanded you be courageous and strong?

00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:52.050
Do not be struck with terror or fear, for Jehovah your God is with you wherever you go.

00:47:52.050 --> 00:48:04.610
With that scripture in mind, please enjoy the music video for this month entitled Be Courageous and Strong.

00:48:04.610 --> 00:48:08.610
It's dark outside to start the day.

00:48:08.610 --> 00:48:20.099
The place starts to pray for her kids at school and their brothers who.

00:48:20.099 --> 00:48:28.099
Father help us be faithful when things make it hard to go.

00:48:28.099 --> 00:48:33.099
She never thinks of losing home.

00:48:33.099 --> 00:48:38.099
Never stops being kind in that song.

00:48:38.099 --> 00:49:38.380
It's always our mind to make you strong.

00:49:38.380 --> 00:50:53.280
So she never needs that song.

00:50:53.280 --> 00:51:58.699
We've seen many examples of modesty on the program this month.

00:51:58.699 --> 00:52:07.699
First, the McConnell sisters helped us appreciate that true family happiness is only possible when we followed Jehovah's principles.

00:52:07.699 --> 00:52:13.699
Modest parents know their limitations and will rely on Jehovah's guidance.

00:52:13.699 --> 00:52:21.699
After the talk, we saw how a young brother's modesty protected him from sinning against Jehovah.

00:52:21.699 --> 00:52:28.699
Next, we saw examples of organizational achievements, all of which require modesty.

00:52:28.699 --> 00:52:40.699
We saw this not only in the Faith and Action Museum at Warwick, but also with the satellite provision for JW Broadcasting in Sub-Saharan Africa.

00:52:40.699 --> 00:52:46.699
And we need to be careful not to confuse our imperfect view of ourselves with modesty.

00:52:46.699 --> 00:52:51.699
Instead, we should do all we can to support Jehovah's work.

00:52:52.699 --> 00:52:58.699
And as we do, Jehovah will support us as this month's music video highlighted.

00:52:58.699 --> 00:53:04.699
And later this month, you'll find an exciting report on video on demand.

00:53:04.699 --> 00:53:11.699
It's about the work of the publishing committee of the governing body, so tune in again for that.

00:53:11.699 --> 00:53:18.699
To conclude, let's visit our brothers and sisters in Tasmania, Australia.

00:53:18.699 --> 00:53:31.699
Tasmania is Australia's smallest state and is an island located about 240 kilometers or 150 miles south of the mainland.

00:53:31.699 --> 00:53:43.699
Despite its small landmass, it's known for its very diverse landscape, featuring beautiful yet rugged mountain, lake, and coastal landscapes.

00:53:43.699 --> 00:53:52.699
The central plateau is a prominent feature of Tasmania thanks to its more than 4,000 lakes of glacial origin.

00:53:52.699 --> 00:53:59.699
This island is home to close to 1,800 publishers in 22 congregations.

00:53:59.699 --> 00:54:03.699
And this is the Cuenville congregation.

00:54:03.699 --> 00:54:07.699
They care for Australia's southernmost territory.

00:54:07.699 --> 00:54:19.699
Although their territory is vast, and many of the publishers are advanced in years, the congregation is known to assist neighboring congregations with their territories.

00:54:19.699 --> 00:54:27.699
In 2016, the Cuenville congregation was happy to see their kingdom hall get renovated.

00:54:27.699 --> 00:54:36.699
And when visiting brothers come to give a public talk in Cuenville, it's not unusual that they get a box of local produce as a gift.

00:54:36.699 --> 00:54:46.699
Our brothers and sisters in the Cuenville congregation send us their warm Christian love, and we love them very much.

00:54:46.699 --> 00:54:55.699
Until next month, this is JW Broadcasting from the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses.
