00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:17.600
When I was 21 years old, I was sent to prison in the Nunsan Military Training Center

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.640
because I refused to serve in the military.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.579
The soldier working in the military prison came and started to beat me, and he beat me

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:31.370
relentlessly.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.909
It was late December 1975.

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:43.159
More of the brothers were put into standing solitary confinement cells, called doggochang.

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:48.500
It literally feels like you're in a coffin.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.659
The outside temperature dropped to minus 13 degrees Celsius, and cold air seeped out from

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:58.939
the wet walls.

00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:03.460
The brothers couldn't lay down to sleep, so they had to crouch.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.079
And I could hear them groaning all night.

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:14.040
I extended my hand through the iron bars to the brother in the cell next to mine, and

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.040
he did the same.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:24.489
We held hands and encouraged each other to stay strong.

00:01:24.489 --> 00:01:29.689
My health condition wasn't really good while serving my prison sentence.

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:38.650
I weighed about 47 kg, and without my family support, I was mentally and physically weak.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.930
After these extremely difficult circumstances, there were times I wasn't able to eat at

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.090
all.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.569
During those times, the brothers provided me with porridge which was easy to digest, warm

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:56.170
clothing, and a sleeping bag for the winter.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.659
I could really feel their love.

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:07.060
Having been to prison three times, I truly feel that Jehovah showed interest in me, and

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.379
took care of me just as he promised in first Peter 5.7.

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:19.259
He especially supported me through my brothers when I was facing difficulties.

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:26.060
A day in the prison started with eating breakfast and then moving 300 bricks.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.979
After lunch, we would have to carry another 300 bricks.

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:36.979
Because I usually finished my work early, I had a 20 minute break before going back in.

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:44.259
However, this brother named Park Byung-Man, who was much stronger and bigger than I was,

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:47.180
carried bricks all day long.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.500
I found out later that Park Byung-Man was carrying chess on Q's share of bricks because of his

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.099
frail health.

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:02.180
This kind of brotherly love really moved me to start studying the Bible.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:08.979
I got baptized a year later in April of 1977 in the An Young Prison.

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:15.900
After getting baptized, my mother passed away, and two months before being released, my

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.300
father passed away as well.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.539
So that time was especially difficult for me.

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:27.539
But the brothers encouraged me with their warm words and kind gestures.

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:36.860
Their encouragement really touched me and helped me to endure until I was released.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:43.060
One time, I had a severe stomach ache.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:49.379
The symptoms were not getting any better with the medication I was given, so I was having

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.860
a very difficult time.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.740
One day, we would serve some vegetables as a side dish.

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:04.659
One brother, he crushed and squeezed the vegetables to make juice for me.

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:07.979
He cared for me that way for several days.

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:14.620
I really would like to see that self-sacrificing and loving brother once again.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:21.540
At the time, none of our publications other than the Bible were allowed into the prison.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.100
Of course, that includes our songbook.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:31.180
The brothers memorized the lyrics from the songbook, and it would write them down.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.379
Also, there were some songs that were sung at the regional convention.

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:37.379
Songs like...

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.649
Oh.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.420
We sang them silently together, even in this isolated place.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:16.620
It was a great source of encouragement to share the love among our fellow brothers.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:22.779
I remember this encouraging scripture from 1 Corinthians 10 verse 13.

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:28.339
It says that Jehovah does not let us be tempted beyond what we can bear and will make the

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:31.740
way out so we may endure it.

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:37.779
Although there were many challenges, I was convinced that Jehovah would always make a way out

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:39.860
through our fellow brothers.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.980
Even though 40 years have passed, when we look back at those days, the memories are still

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.959
fresh and we are moved to tears at times.

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:55.360
So to make a meaningful trip out of our 40 years of friendship, all the friends who went

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:04.670
through the same trials decided to visit the headquarters in the United States together.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:10.339
It's really refreshing to be here with everyone again today.

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:19.470
It feels like I'm taking a field trip.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:25.829
I was especially moved to tears when I saw our old prison uniforms.

00:06:25.829 --> 00:06:33.889
There in the museum, at World Headquarters, displayed in the neutrality section.

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:41.370
While on the tour, the brothers sat and laid down on the floor inside the Dokkochang.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:48.500
And we were able to reflect on the times we spent together in prison.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:53.579
Our gratitude to Jehovah for giving us such loyal friends was renewed.
