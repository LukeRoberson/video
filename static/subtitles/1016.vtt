00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:09.439
When I was in my 40s, I was divorced, I had three younger kids at home, I was working

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:14.439
free jobs, and I had drifted away from the congregation.

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:23.199
I had an acquaintance who was telling me that I was in a cult and that I needed to look

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.519
at some information that he had.

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:32.320
When I was about 30 years old, a fellow employee saw that I was one of Jehovah's Witnesses and

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.840
was trying to access JW.org.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.060
He told me about someone he knew in another country who could prove to me that Jehovah's

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.600
Witnesses didn't have the truth.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.520
That made me curious, and little by little I was persuaded to look at apostate material.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.700
So I was born and raised in the truth, chose to dedicate myself to Jehovah at the age of

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.579
16, but I began to associate with people who had either formerly been associated with

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.859
the truth or were very loosely associated with Jehovah in his organization, and that's

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:11.180
really where the apostasy began to take root.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.420
As I was reading this literature, I saw through it to an extent, but when you're drifting

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.140
away, you're looking for a reason not to believe.

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:30.459
I began to feed my mind with different philosophies, different ideas, even studied different

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:31.959
religions.

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:37.579
I told myself that I was doing that academically, but it started to influence the way that

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:40.819
I thought and felt about things.

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:43.299
Eventually the elders reached out to me.

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.620
I was very combative with those brothers.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:55.099
I even made the accusation that Noah's Ark was a fairy tale, that that was part of mythology.

00:01:55.099 --> 00:02:00.420
Those apostate doubts that I was reading kept going deeper and deeper into my heart.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.379
I stopped reading the publications.

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:08.020
I stopped going to the meetings, and as a result my spiritual routine was dead.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.939
So I thought I'd try to find truth elsewhere, and I looked for something out there that

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:18.909
was in accord with what I knew the Bible taught, but I couldn't find anything.

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:24.789
One Sunday morning, I rode by the Kingdom Hall, and I said to myself, oh, they're all

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:31.389
in there waiting for Armageddon, immediately when I thought that thought I said to myself,

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:35.870
well at least they feel good about themselves, how do you feel?

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.030
And the answer was, I felt terrible.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.909
Initially, skillful use of the scriptures and just reasoning with me, the elders got

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:51.550
me to realize that I had been carried off, or that I had been taken captive by human philosophy,

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.229
by the deceptions and this empty reasoning of men.

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:58.830
I actually said a prayer.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.629
I supplicated Jehovah, that he would really show me the way to the truth, and he took away

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:09.110
this feeling of emptiness, spiritually speaking.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:15.789
I realized that relationship with Jehovah, that's our most precious possession, I had to

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:17.629
get back.

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.430
I started to study the Bible with sincerity.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.590
I wanted it to affect my mind and my heart, and I wanted it to affect change in my behavior.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.509
Now as I did that, I felt Jehovah blessing those efforts.

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:35.629
He began to help me to rebuild that relationship with him.

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:38.229
So I began to use Jehovah's name.

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:43.949
Speaking about Jehovah became a wonderful joy and a great pleasure to me, and the result

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:48.789
was that my ministry was very productive, and it's an amazing joy to be able to help

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:52.430
someone come to love Jehovah.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.789
I was just so happy to be back under Jehovah's wings and have that peace of mind.

00:03:58.789 --> 00:04:04.509
How loving Jehovah is, he wants to help us, and what better help we have, these the best

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:05.509
in the universe.
