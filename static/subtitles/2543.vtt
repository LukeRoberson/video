00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.039
When I learned that I did the conversion drama in the studio, it was a very daunting task to me.

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:17.440
It was not easy because I had no experience.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.239
The recording was going to take place in a private home without knowing how isolated room.

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:25.239
And I asked myself, hi, can it be possible?

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:30.239
It's when a Buddha says, we can do our own local isolated room.

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.840
We try to look for food and all the material necessary and we can make it with something.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.840
The work that I had to do in the recording studio was to follow the reader.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.439
That's make sure that when he's reading, he doesn't misread any word.

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:46.640
He doesn't mispronounce any word and he doesn't skip any.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.439
So it's a work that needs a lot of concentration.

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:55.439
Sometimes, after the reader has read so well, the mission tells you it cannot enter.

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:56.640
It's too long.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.640
And we have to retranslate the script in the studio.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.040
The brothers in Kumbha and even the villages around, they were a wonderful support.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.849
They supported in a way I never expected.

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:17.250
I'm a teacher, a mother and a housewife.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.049
There are times I have to leave the school, rush to the house.

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.049
From the house, I keep the children before coming to the studio.

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.250
I really appreciated the support from my husband.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.650
He has been supporting. That is very fine.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.650
By this time, he added more to it.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:41.650
He had to do some cleaning, do some laundry and other household works just to make sure that I am in this studio on time.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.650
All long days, we used to have short meetings where to encourage us for the work that was within us during the week.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.409
The voice that I'm using to talk, it does not belong to me.

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.409
It is Papa Jehovah who gave me the voice.

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.409
So if Papa Jehovah can tell me that during,

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.409
now it's time for me to use the voice I gave you.

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.409
Who am I to refuse?

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.409
Life in studio was sometimes very funny.

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:14.409
There were so many birds singing outside, even though they were singing so good and nice.

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:16.409
But that was the 7-day recording.

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:20.409
And for that, what I was supposed to go outside to drive the birds away so that we can consider their recording.

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:26.409
We were trying to get the sister to express a strong emotion, to cry.

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:29.409
We had to try, we tried, we tried.

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.409
Well, this is not God's right.

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:37.409
I was so excited that I would just say, excellent, excellent, excellent.

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.409
Forgotten that you are so mean to ask this man.

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:43.409
And my voice in the end, we recorded a nice part of the whole thing.

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:45.409
My body, my sister.

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:49.409
Actually, what am I going to do at this studio?

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:53.409
So I said, having an assignment.

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:58.409
They told me that let me tell them a bit of the assignment.

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:05.409
So I told them that it was confidential and they told me that I am a good girl.

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:15.110
The brothers and sisters of the recording team, apart from being brothers and sisters,

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.110
have considered them as close friends.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.110
Because we have some great moments together.

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.110
Flushing together, going to the Kingdom Hall and also having some relaxation moments together

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.110
that was so encouraging for me to consider their work.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.110
When we see the final production of the video,

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.110
if you ask me that, what did you actually do?

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.110
Come, I will tell you that, I don't know anything.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.110
I cannot tell you what I really did because Jehovah's Period was actually working to carry out the work.
