00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:06.540
When I first began serving at Bethel, I'd call home to speak with my family, and my mother

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.980
would always ask, have they told you when the date of Armageddon is?

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.500
Those who's being humorous and didn't expect an answer, her question reveals what we all

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.019
long for.

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:21.579
Jehovah's promised new world.

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:24.579
Maybe you have in a sense asked Jehovah that question.

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:27.260
How much longer, Jehovah?

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.539
Or said to Jehovah, I'm exhausted.

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.340
I don't know how much longer I can keep going.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.659
Please, Jehovah, when will your promises for a world of lasting peace, refreshment, and

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:44.020
relief from the pressures of this world come true?

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.460
We all likely feel this way from time to time.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.380
What can help us not give up, not give out in our spiritual battle?

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.979
Note the words of Jesus at Mark 13, verse 29.

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:04.700
Notice what he says, likewise, also you.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:10.260
When you see these things happening, know that he is near at the doors.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.099
What things would we see happening?

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:18.019
Prophecy being fulfilled.

00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:24.340
When we recognize Bible prophecies being fulfilled before our eyes, our faith is fortified.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.659
We see the end as eminent.

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.900
We recognize that we're all most done.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.219
That helps us not give out.

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:36.579
What are some of these prophecies?

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:42.140
You're familiar with the prophecies of earthquakes, wars and reports of wars, food shortages,

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.700
and disease all happening at once.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.060
You see these things happening.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.579
We see the diminished love of God and the deteriorating attitude of people in general.

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:04.180
As foretold in 2 Timothy chapter 3, 2 Timothy 313 says, wicked men and imposter will advance

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.060
from bad to worse.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.259
You see these things happening.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.099
As foretold this good news of the kingdom is being preached worldwide, now in over a thousand

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:16.699
languages.

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:19.340
You see these things happening.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.780
As a result of Christ's rule, the knowledge of Jehovah is abundantly overflowing.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.620
You see these things happening.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.139
And what about Isaiah 45-18?

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:37.620
Here Jehovah calls himself the maker of the earth, who did not create it simply for nothing,

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.300
but formed it to be inhabited.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:46.060
Today, scientists say that the world is on the brink of becoming uninhabitable.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.740
They warn that if action to stop global warming is not taken quickly, its compounding effects

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.139
will become irreversible.

00:02:55.139 --> 00:03:03.419
At Revelation 11-18, the Bible foretold that in our day man would be ruining the earth.

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:09.219
And it also assures us that Jehovah will step in and not let the earth be completely

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:11.819
ruined.

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.419
Some may wonder how much worse things will get.

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:24.699
Interestingly, at Luke 17-20, Jesus said this, Luke 17-20, the kingdom of God is not coming

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:28.460
with striking observableness.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:34.539
This means that world conditions during the last days would not be so extreme that people

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:38.099
would be forced to believe that the end is near.

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:45.099
As Matthew 24-37-39 indicates, they would still be eating and drinking, getting married,

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.460
unable to carry on their everyday lives.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.259
How should this affect us?

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:55.620
It should fortify us not to give up.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.939
At Mark 13-35, Jesus said we must keep on the watch.

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:04.780
This means stay awake, be on guard.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:13.219
And in the parallel account in Matthew 24, Jesus connects this with being ready.

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:17.860
What will help us to do this when we feel so exhausted?

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.139
Where can we get strength to keep up the fight?

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.379
In a word, trust.

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:30.699
We all love Jehovah.

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:37.980
We want to be convinced of Jehovah's loyal love for us individually.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:43.939
And we trust that he'll always be there to help us.

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:55.160
Notice on screen the assurance Jehovah gives at Hebrews 13-5, I will never leave you,

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.480
and I will never abandon you.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.839
Jehovah has been sustaining us.

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:06.759
Think how he sustains you.

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:12.079
Maybe you've experienced the ravages of a natural disaster.

00:05:12.079 --> 00:05:14.720
Jehovah sustains you.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.079
Maybe you've dealt with the loss of a loved one.

00:05:18.079 --> 00:05:20.720
Jehovah has sustained you.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:27.000
Whatever trial we've gone through, we can see how Jehovah has helped us.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.399
This confirms for us that he'll sustain us in the future, and we have the confidence

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:43.120
that stated at Psalm 46, 1 and 2, God is our refuge and strength, a help that is readily

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.160
found in times of distress.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.199
That is why we will not fear, though the earth undergoes change, though the mountains

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:54.160
topple into the depths of the sea.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:02.639
These emphatic expressions leave no doubt that Jehovah will care for us.

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:06.680
Why is this reminder so important?

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:13.439
Over 6 of Hebrews 13, links trust with courage.

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:24.329
Notice what it says, so that we may be of good courage, and say, Jehovah is my helper.

00:06:24.329 --> 00:06:26.329
I will not be afraid.

00:06:26.329 --> 00:06:29.250
What can man do to me?

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:35.290
Because it doesn't say our or their helper, it says my helper.

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:37.209
We love Jehovah.

00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:46.579
We can also be absolutely convinced that Jehovah loves us and will help us individually.

00:06:46.579 --> 00:06:51.300
At times, it can be difficult to trust that Jehovah loves us personally and will act

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.500
in our behalf.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:58.060
What can help build our trust in Jehovah's love?

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.699
Let's discuss three ways.

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:03.339
This is Proverbs 15.

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:10.019
Proverbs 15, Notice verse 9, Jehovah detests the way of the wicked one.

00:07:10.019 --> 00:07:16.339
But he loves the one who pursues righteousness.

00:07:16.339 --> 00:07:24.379
He loves the one who pursues or chases after righteousness.

00:07:24.379 --> 00:07:30.660
He knows we can't be perfectly righteous, but he loves us for trying our best.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:37.620
As he said for pursuing righteousness, he loves us because we don't quit.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:46.459
We can trust that he'll never abandon us because we don't give up in pursuing righteousness.

00:07:46.459 --> 00:07:51.459
Second, Pour out your heart to Jehovah.

00:07:51.459 --> 00:07:54.540
Limitations 2.19 says this.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.540
Limitations 2.19.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:03.899
Pour out your heart like water before the face of Jehovah.

00:08:03.899 --> 00:08:08.740
It doesn't say pour out your mind or your thoughts.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:16.500
But pour your heart that includes our feelings, our concerns, our anxieties.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:23.180
We pour our heart like one pours out water, not holding anything back.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:28.699
When we express to our Heavenly Father, our love and appreciation for Him,

00:08:28.699 --> 00:08:34.299
when we tell Him our concerns and desires, and when we ask for His direction,

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:38.740
we show that we value our friendship with Him.

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.299
What will be the result for you?

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:47.259
The more you pour your heart like water and feel His personal response to you,

00:08:47.259 --> 00:08:50.299
the more you'll sense His love for you.

00:08:50.299 --> 00:08:54.220
The more you'll trust that He'll never abandon you.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:59.899
Your gratitude for Jehovah's enduring love will increase.

00:08:59.899 --> 00:09:07.019
And third, remember that trials do not mean a loss of Jehovah's favor.

00:09:07.019 --> 00:09:13.259
Our enemy knows that feeling close to Jehovah is the source of our strength,

00:09:13.259 --> 00:09:16.460
so he'll try to undermine our confidence.

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:19.580
Any hopes that we break away from Jehovah?

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:24.299
For example, when Job was undergoing a severe trial,

00:09:24.299 --> 00:09:33.139
his false confiders lyingly said that the reason for these trials was that he'd lost Jehovah's favor.

00:09:33.139 --> 00:09:41.779
Jehovah reminded Job to look at creation and to see His love and wisdom.

00:09:41.779 --> 00:09:44.580
How did faithful Job respond?

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:48.720
He said at Job 42-5,

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.799
My ears have heard about you,

00:09:51.799 --> 00:09:57.039
but now I do see you with my eyes.

00:09:57.039 --> 00:10:00.320
We may wonder if we've lost Jehovah's favor.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:08.200
We should ask Jehovah to help us see Him and see His loyal love for us every day.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:16.340
Ask Him to help you use this trial as a stepping stone to love and trust Him even more.

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:21.019
We've discussed one way we get ready for the upcoming events.

00:10:21.019 --> 00:10:27.299
Build our trust that Jehovah has loyal love for us individually.

00:10:27.299 --> 00:10:35.379
Trusting that Jehovah will never abandon us gives us the strength to keep up the fight and keep on the watch.

00:10:35.379 --> 00:10:41.779
At Ephesians 6-16, faith or trust in Jehovah is compared to a shield,

00:10:41.779 --> 00:10:49.539
a shield which you can extinguish all the wicked ones' burning arrows or all of Satan's spiritual attacks.

00:10:49.539 --> 00:10:55.379
For example, when we hear lies about Jehovah, His organization,

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:59.940
and those He's appointed to take the lead, we will not be shaken.

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:03.779
We won't give up or give out.

00:11:03.779 --> 00:11:08.259
We know the prophecy at Matthew 24-45 has been fulfilled.

00:11:08.259 --> 00:11:15.220
Jehovah has lovingly provided His slave that's faithful and discreet.

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:23.299
We recognize that Jehovah provides spiritual food and direction through this body of men at the right time.

00:11:23.379 --> 00:11:26.659
We're not left floundering or trying to find our way,

00:11:26.659 --> 00:11:33.379
therefore we remain obedient and responsive to the direction we receive.

00:11:33.379 --> 00:11:40.919
We never dismiss it, even if it doesn't appear practical from a human standpoint.

00:11:40.919 --> 00:11:47.080
Trusting in Jehovah's loyal love has saved His people in the past.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:53.720
In 2 Chronicles chapter 20, verse 1 and 2 tells us that Jehastaphat

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:58.200
learned that a coalition of nations, a large crowd from the region of the sea,

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.600
were coming against Him.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:05.000
Jehastaphat already had the habit of turning to Jehovah.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.080
He resolved to search for Jehovah.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:12.360
How did He and His faithful subjects do this?

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:18.039
Jehastaphat poured His heart like water to Jehovah.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:23.639
Notice in verse 12 how He expresses His complete trust in Jehovah.

00:12:26.059 --> 00:12:30.460
For we are powerless before this large crowd that is coming against us,

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.100
and we do not know what we should do.

00:12:34.139 --> 00:12:36.620
But our eyes are toward you.

00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:41.980
How did Jehovah respond? Notice verse 15,

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:46.220
Jehovah sent Jehazail to reassure them.

00:12:47.659 --> 00:12:51.659
Do not be afraid or be terrified because of this large crowd

00:12:51.659 --> 00:12:54.700
for the battle is not yours but God's.

00:12:56.379 --> 00:13:01.259
The strategy that Jehastaphat followed didn't seem practical from a human standpoint.

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:07.259
Jehastaphat appointed singers dressed in holy adornment to praise Jehovah.

00:13:08.059 --> 00:13:12.139
And how unusual that He put them in front of the armed men.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:17.980
Were they singing songs about how Jehovah defeated their enemies in past wars?

00:13:19.259 --> 00:13:24.860
No. They sang about Jehovah's loyal love.

00:13:26.539 --> 00:13:27.820
What was the result?

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:31.019
Jehovah confused their enemies and they attacked each other.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.220
What lessons can we learn from this account?

00:13:35.779 --> 00:13:40.340
Trusting Jehovah includes trusting His representatives.

00:13:41.379 --> 00:13:46.659
The life-saving direction we receive from Jehovah's organization may not appear practical

00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:47.940
from a human standpoint.

00:13:49.139 --> 00:13:54.259
But we recognize the fulfillment of the prophecy at Matthew 24-45

00:13:54.259 --> 00:13:59.139
about the faithful and discreet slave and we're ready to obey any instruction they provide.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:09.139
Yes, getting ready includes building trust and being convinced that Jehovah will deliver us

00:14:09.139 --> 00:14:16.309
from the wicked one. Trusting Him will help us understand the prophetic role of the faithful

00:14:16.309 --> 00:14:22.950
and discreet slave during this time of the end when Jehovah is using them to provide life-saving

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:28.789
direction. This direction is helping us to stay ready.

00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:41.669
Jehovah sustained us in the past and He sustains us now. Seeing these things happening can also

00:14:41.669 --> 00:14:50.389
fortify and strengthen us. Many of you have been fighting to keep on the watch for many years.

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:59.029
Now the end is clearly in sight. We don't want to give up now. Notice the reassurance,

00:14:59.029 --> 00:15:06.070
agglations, chapter 6, verse 9. Galatians, chapter 6, 9.

00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:15.269
So let us not give up in doing what is fine. For in due time we will reap if we do not

00:15:16.149 --> 00:15:23.429
tire out. Because of our imperfect flesh and the efforts of Satan and this wicked world,

00:15:23.429 --> 00:15:29.909
we must constantly battle negative influences. Some of you dear brothers and sisters

00:15:29.909 --> 00:15:39.029
must fight hard every day to maintain your relationship with Jehovah. Don't give up. Your fight

00:15:39.029 --> 00:15:45.590
has not been in vain. You've made the right choices. Jehovah has seen your loyal love for him

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:53.669
and he treasures your devotion. Time and time again you've made sacrifices. Left your comfort zone

00:15:53.669 --> 00:15:58.950
to give Jehovah your best, to stay active in the ministry, to keep taking in spiritual food

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:06.149
and to teach your children how to speak about Jehovah. Jehovah loves you dearly for this

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:13.750
and will loyally continue to help you until the battle is won. Do not give up now.

00:16:15.669 --> 00:16:21.669
In your young ones, Jehovah loves you too. He knows that you're growing up in a world that's

00:16:21.669 --> 00:16:27.669
broken. He knows that it can be hard for you to maintain hope for the future. Please,

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:37.029
never forget that your God, your Heavenly Father loves you dearly. Never forget that your future

00:16:37.669 --> 00:16:47.909
is bright. Whether we're young or old or in between, we will not give up. We're so close. We

00:16:47.909 --> 00:16:54.710
see these things happening with our own eyes. So we'll keep on the watch. We'll trust Jehovah

00:16:54.710 --> 00:17:00.950
with all our hearts. We'll trust Jehovah's arrangements and we will not give out in our spiritual

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:13.990
battle because we will reap rich blessings soon, very soon.
