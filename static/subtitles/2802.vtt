WEBVTT

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.549
Jehovah's organization has made use of videos over the years, over the decades.

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:12.550
But from 2014 forward, we have seen a dramatic increase in the use of videos.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.550
And that has really impacted how we teach and how we reach hearts.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.550
Because of the demand for more videos, more space was needed.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.550
So we purchased the Mount Ebo property.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.219
And there we have been making many of our large video productions.

00:00:30.219 --> 00:00:34.219
Well, the response from the brothers and sisters in the field has been outstanding.

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:35.219
It's been amazing.

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.219
It's actually been very encouraging for the teaching committee and the governing body

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:45.219
to see how the brothers and sisters appreciate the videos, the music,

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:48.219
and the recordings that are produced.

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:53.219
It's helping them to really understand the teaching points in God's Word.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.219
It helps them to deal with the anxieties and pressures of life.

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:00.219
It really helps them to appreciate, too, what's happening around the world

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:06.219
when they hear reports, traumatizations, and interviews.

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:11.219
With this explosive growth and even more coming on the horizon,

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:15.219
the governing body has determined it's Jehovah's direction

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:20.219
that we take further steps to support this expanded use of video.

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:27.219
So we are thrilled to announce an exciting initiative currently underway to accomplish this.

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:33.219
The creation of a site dedicated primarily to media production,

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:38.219
the building of a new facility in Ramapo, New York.

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:50.189
Yes, the governing body has approved construction of an additional World Headquarters Complex

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.189
on a 248 acre property purchased in 2009.

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:05.209
The property is located two miles or about three kilometers from the existing World Headquarters Facility in Warwick.

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:11.550
Our objective is to build a facility similar in size to Warwick,

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.550
which would include ten residence buildings, a main office building,

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.550
eight studio spaces for audio video productions,

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.550
a multipurpose space including kitchen, dining, and meeting area,

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.550
plus a visitor center.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.550
This will culminate in a location capable of housing over 1,000 volunteers

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:43.550
with 920 office spaces and will accommodate audio video services,

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.550
text processing, writing correspondence, and the art department.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.599
Planning and engineering are already underway.

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.599
We are beginning our discussions with the local authorities on this project.

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:04.599
In Jehovah willing, we hope to start site work in 2022

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:10.599
and have a completed facility by December 31, 2026.

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.599
But that means we need you.

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.599
We need your prayers, your support, your strong backs

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.599
because this project will call for thousands of volunteers,

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:29.599
with as many as 1,500 volunteers a day during the peak of construction.

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:34.599
But we have utmost confidence in Psalm 110 and verse 3 when it says

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:40.599
your people will offer themselves willingly on the day of your military force.

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:47.599
So do not hold back, do whatever you can to support this exciting new initiative.

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:51.599
We will need thousands upon thousands of willing volunteers

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:55.599
who are available for one week to one month or six months,

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:58.599
wherever the case may be, to help with this project.

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:02.599
On recent large scale projects, we found it very successful

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:08.599
to hire contractors for the specialised or the heavily mechanised parts of the work,

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:13.599
such as the steel superstructures or the concrete superstructures of the buildings,

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:19.600
building envelopes, cladding or roofing, and then to get volunteers to carry out

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.600
the all-important hidden work or where the detail really makes the difference.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.600
For example, the underground utilities or the site works,

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.600
the mechanical and electrical fit out of the buildings,

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.600
as well as the all-important finishes.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.600
We want to work with the LDC to identify brothers and sisters

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.600
that can help and be trained now.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.600
They could either be assigned to local projects with the LDC,

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.600
some of them could be invited to start helping on renovation projects like the one at Patterson.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.600
And this will allow us to start giving them valuable training now

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.600
that will be useful on the Ramapo project.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:59.600
We're hoping on the Ramapo project that Jehovah's Spirit will energise the Brotherhood again

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.600
as it did at Warwick and also in the Britain project.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.600
Really seen from the initial concept design through the estimating

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.600
and establishing budgets and reviewing the personnel needs,

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.600
all the way to the first initial meetings with the town,

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.600
prayerful consideration was given by all the brothers and sisters involved

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.600
and so we could really see in every one of those decisions

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.600
that Jehovah was steering this project and he knows already how it will be completed.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.600
Going back more than a decade ago from between 2005 to 2009,

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.600
when we were searching for property, these two properties became available

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.600
and they both seemed as though they were suitable.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.600
And it was the organization's decision to go with one and not develop the other.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.600
Now when it seems like there is a real need,

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.600
we can develop the second property that we already have, that we already own

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.600
and we already have a good reception with.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.600
To me, those things are face strengthening because what I see is that

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.600
the work we were doing a decade ago and that the brothers and sisters

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.600
and work involved with it in the branch committee,

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.600
we didn't know what the outcome might be

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.600
and we didn't know what the use might be over this last decade.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.600
But now what we have is something that can be very suitable as we move forward.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.600
And to me, that's face strengthening. I see Jehovah's hand in that.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:21.600
Projects like this in addition to serving a very practical need,

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:27.600
offer an opportunity for Jehovah's people to show their thankfulness

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.600
and their zeal for him.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.600
And as we experience with Warwick,

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.600
just the project alone and the participation of our brothers and sisters

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.600
from all over the country resulted in a spiritual blessing

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.600
to thousands of individuals, their families and their congregations.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.600
And we fully expect this project will have the same positive effect.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.600
On a project of this scale,

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.600
the early strategic decisions are absolutely crucial.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:06.600
Now what we've seen with the design and project planning teams coming together

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:13.600
with the plans for the support, feeding, housing and care of the volunteers

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:18.600
with the spirit that's already evident amongst those who are involved in the project

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.600
and also the strong backing of the government body

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.600
we clearly see that Jehovah's hand is with us.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.600
James, four eight states, draw close to God

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.600
and he will draw close to you.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:39.600
Yes, Jehovah is allowing once every opportunity to draw close to him as never before

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.600
and he is speaking to them through his inspired word

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:50.600
as well as vivid artwork, beautiful music and heart-touching videos.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.600
And it's the feeling of the entire governing body

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:59.600
that this new site will allow us to produce even more wonderful products

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.600
to help us to do just that.
