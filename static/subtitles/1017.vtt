WEBVTT

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:12.769
Oh, honestly, he shouldn't have.

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.510
You're going to need it.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.589
Gabriel leaving to serve where the need is greater.

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:23.989
Made us feel like we missed the chance to expand our ministry.

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:29.000
Why don't we start now?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.320
We're not getting any younger.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.200
Yeah, we could ask the circuit obviously if we're going to have a vice on his next visit,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.520
I'm worried he's going to say we should join the new language group.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.799
It's a big need in our circuit.

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:50.640
We've never felt like the right people to serve in a foreign language.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.079
Brother Lindstrom shared Zechariah 823 with us,

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:00.399
which helped us to see how we could have a hand in help in men out of all the languages of the nations.

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:11.349
Learn about Jehovah.

00:01:11.349 --> 00:01:21.299
Learning was a struggle at first.

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.500
But with Jehovah's help, we made progress.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:48.120
Slowly, even though the language was a challenge,

00:01:48.120 --> 00:02:08.340
loving our new family was not.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.539
Shukar Sabai.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.939
Shukar Sabai?

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:14.139
I'm an alien.

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:15.340
Do you know Romani?

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.340
Oh, yeah, I know.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.939
Sarisiklin, Marijib.

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:19.740
It's Vinny.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:20.539
Moment.

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:29.379
I don't understand.

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:30.979
Morate soni akava.

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:32.379
Say again what you say.

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:35.580
I'm Shukar Sabai.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.580
I'm off to know Elia.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.580
I'm going to see you again.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.860
I'm going to see you again.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:44.860
Come on, Dres.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:45.860
Come on.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:46.860
Come on, Dres.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:47.860
OK.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:48.860
Oh, thank you.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.659
It's true.

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:58.979
We aren't getting any younger.

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:09.620
And that's why we're so glad we took the chance to expand our ministry.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.620
If you told me two years ago that I'd be moving where the need was greater,

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:21.210
I would have laughed.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.210
It all started when they announced a special preaching campaign.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.210
My friend Samuel encouraged me to apply with him.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.210
So what do you think?

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.009
Yeah.

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:36.210
No, but you enjoy that.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:37.210
I know you're going to love it.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.610
That's why I got you a form as well.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.810
All right, we can do this.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.939
OK.

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:47.340
I knew I could do more.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.939
But I was comfortable.

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:51.740
I like doing things on my own terms.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.639
But really, I was afraid of the unknown.

00:03:55.639 --> 00:04:01.710
I needed to examine my heart.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.009
When I read about Abraham's faith at Hebrews 118,

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:08.909
it's like the words jumped off the page.

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:16.009
He went out, although not knowing where he was going.

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:22.089
Who better to be in control of my life than Jehovah?

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:23.689
A door was open to me.

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:25.889
I just needed to go through it.

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:36.689
And what I experienced changed my life.

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:40.089
The results of the campaign were incredible.

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:50.740
And the experience pushed me out of my comfort zone.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.740
All right, Gabe, I'm going to trust you.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:10.480
Come on, give it a try.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:22.459
I saw the ministry in a new way, and I wanted to do more.

00:05:22.459 --> 00:05:28.000
So I calculated the cost and worked with my local elders

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.899
to write to the branch office.

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:46.189
When I heard back with some suggestions,

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:51.189
I prayed about it and did research before choosing.

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:55.689
There were many unknowns, but I couldn't wait.

00:05:55.689 --> 00:06:00.720
It was hard to say goodbye to my friends.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:24.500
But I was ready for whatever Jehovah had installed me.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.600
At our convention, they had the meeting

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.600
for the School for Kingdom of Angelizers.

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:32.699
My friend Anton asked if I was going to go.

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:33.699
Thank you, Bill.

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:34.600
Oh, hey, Anton.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.100
Are you coming?

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.899
To what?

00:06:36.899 --> 00:06:38.199
The ESK meeting.

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:40.899
Oh, no, I wasn't planning on it.

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:43.600
But all right.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.199
Yeah, sure.

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:45.000
I'll go.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
OK, then.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.629
I'll have to wait a second.

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:52.930
I went, but I felt conflicted.

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:57.730
I thought I already have an assignment, one that I love.

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.029
But I didn't fully understand the incredible privilege

00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:05.180
of attending ESK.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.379
I asked the circuit officer a few more questions,

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:11.379
and it felt like this is it.

00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:18.370
It seemed right, and all I had to do was apply online.

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.769
That was months ago.

00:07:20.769 --> 00:07:22.670
Saw us folding you back.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:28.170
I feel like Jehovah led me here, and I've never been happier.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:33.269
But now, another door's opened, and the fear's back.

00:07:33.269 --> 00:07:35.569
It doesn't matter how far you've come.

00:07:35.569 --> 00:07:38.769
Fear in the unknown could be overwhelming.

00:07:38.769 --> 00:07:41.370
Sometimes you need a reminder that Jehovah's leading you

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:43.170
in the right direction.

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.470
Here's one to keep in mind.

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:48.269
Philippians 4, 13.

00:07:48.269 --> 00:07:49.670
Read it.

00:07:49.670 --> 00:08:03.009
And just think about how far Jehovah's taking you.

00:08:03.009 --> 00:08:07.509
For all things, I have the strength

00:08:07.509 --> 00:08:28.160
through the one who gives me power.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.660
Jehovah is in control.

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.360
What was I so afraid of?

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:49.980
I'm bringing too much.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.879
Well, ESK is for two months.

00:08:52.879 --> 00:08:54.779
Well, you were just to light you too.

00:08:54.779 --> 00:08:59.970
Bringing every last thing with you.

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:00.970
Can I?

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:03.470
Can I leave this with you?

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:07.769
It's been on a few adventures, but it's still great for travel.

00:09:07.769 --> 00:09:08.269
Really?

00:09:08.269 --> 00:09:10.070
Yeah, please.

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:27.019
Who knows, you might need it sometimes, too.

00:09:27.019 --> 00:09:30.220
When I learned I was invited to work for a few weeks

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.419
on the upcoming construction project.

00:09:32.419 --> 00:09:34.019
I was thrilled.

00:09:34.019 --> 00:09:37.919
But I'm excitement, quickly turning to anxiety

00:09:37.919 --> 00:09:44.950
because of what I had to do.

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:48.450
I pray to Jehovah for weeks to give me the strength

00:09:48.450 --> 00:10:04.309
to have the conversation with my employer.

00:10:04.309 --> 00:10:08.110
So I wanted to, first of all, say thank you for taking it.

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:11.210
I began to explain about the construction project

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:13.210
and how I'd been invited to volunteer.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:15.009
I really like the time to serve.

00:10:15.009 --> 00:10:17.610
So you want time off?

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:22.750
During the busiest time of our year?

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:23.950
Well, yes.

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:25.049
It's your choice.

00:10:25.049 --> 00:10:33.419
But on the no circumstances will uphold your position.

00:10:33.419 --> 00:10:39.019
Suddenly, this beautiful privilege felt like a huge risk.

00:10:39.019 --> 00:10:56.840
Was I making my life more complicated by doing this?

00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:02.240
I read the account about the people in Nehemiah's day.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.940
They will in spirit demonstrate it faith

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:09.139
and Jerusalem's walls were built by people

00:11:09.139 --> 00:11:16.000
who put their heart into the work.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
I didn't want to miss out on the opportunity

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.700
to serve Jehovah in that way.

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.399
This is my resignation letter.

00:11:22.399 --> 00:11:32.070
I have to have faith that Jehovah will bless my decision.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:35.470
I'm not sure what the future holds when I get back.

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:43.120
But I know Jehovah will take care of me.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:47.220
For now, I'm going to focus on putting my heart

00:11:47.220 --> 00:12:06.429
into the work.

00:12:06.429 --> 00:12:09.629
When a disaster struck in the north of the country,

00:12:09.629 --> 00:12:13.740
we immediately answered the call for help.

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:31.440
Seeing our brothers and sisters in need was heartbreaking.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.740
But what really touched our heart

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:37.039
was the spirit of the local brothers and sisters.

00:12:37.039 --> 00:12:39.240
They were like the Macedonians.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:13:03.750
They didn't have much, but they gave generously from the heart.

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:06.649
When we got home, Madeline and I

00:13:06.649 --> 00:13:13.399
resolved to show the same kind of spirit.

00:13:13.399 --> 00:13:16.899
First, our appreciation led us to review

00:13:16.899 --> 00:13:19.700
our contribution to the worldwide work.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.200
I've come up with this figure.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:29.720
Is this right?

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.919
Yes.

00:13:31.919 --> 00:13:33.220
That's just like Jehovah.

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:55.250
We looked for ways to be generous to those around us.

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:58.450
We discovered that we had the means to give more

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:21.159
so we didn't hold back.

00:14:21.159 --> 00:14:23.059
And then our congregation was invited

00:14:23.059 --> 00:14:33.480
to help with a special preaching campaign.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.179
I think we could do a bit more.

00:14:35.179 --> 00:14:37.379
Could we push ourselves a bit further?

00:14:37.379 --> 00:14:38.379
I'd really like to.

00:14:38.379 --> 00:14:41.480
It was within our power to help.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:48.419
And that's exactly what we did.

00:14:48.419 --> 00:14:49.919
I'm bringing too much.

00:14:49.919 --> 00:14:51.419
No, of course not.
