Jesus, his brother said to him, leave here, go into Judea so that your disciples may also

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:25.170
see the works you're doing.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.929
For no one does anything in secret when he seeks to be known publicly.

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:38.780
If you are doing these things, show yourself to the world.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:47.240
His brothers were in fact not exercising faith in him.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:53.200
Among the first things I handed on to you was what I also received, that Christ died

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.920
for our sins according to the scriptures, and that he was buried.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:09.870
If you are doing these things, show yourself to the world.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.670
Yes, that he was raised up on the third day.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.510
After that, he appeared to James.
