00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:06.259
and introduction to the book of Zephaniah.

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:09.259
Zephaniah was a prophet of Jehovah in Judah,

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:13.259
and he wrote the book bearing his name.

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.260
He prophesied early in the reign of Faithful King Josiah.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.260
He completed his book before the year 648 BCE,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.260
some years before Nahum and Habakkuk wrote their books,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.260
and over 40 years before the destruction of Jerusalem

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.259
and 607 BCE.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.979
The book of Zephaniah contains three chapters.

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:41.979
Chapter 1 warns the people of Judah that Jehovah's Day

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:44.979
of judgment is approaching quickly.

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:48.979
The people are focusing on material wealth,

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:50.979
worshipping false gods,

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:55.979
and assuming that Jehovah will not intervene in their affairs.

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:00.979
In chapter 2, the people are urged to seek Jehovah.

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:06.980
They should trust in God and live by His righteous standards.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.980
Did you know?

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.980
Zephaniah's efforts bore fruit.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.980
Young King Josiah carried out a campaign against false worship

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.980
to rid the nation of idolatry and to restore true worship

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.299
at the temple.

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.299
Chapter 2 conveys a message of doom

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.299
against the surrounding nations of Felistia.

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:35.299
Amen, Moab, Ethiopia, and Assyria.

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.299
In chapter 3, Jerusalem's proud inhabitants

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.299
continue to disobey Jehovah despite His warning.

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.299
Although Jehovah promises to remove the haughty ones,

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.299
He offers hope and joy to humble repentant ones.

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.609
As you read the book of Zephaniah,

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:58.609
note how we should guard against thinking

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:01.609
that Jehovah's Day will not arrive.

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:04.609
How those who seek Jehovah will be saved

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:07.609
and how Jehovah gathers humble ones

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:10.610
to be subjects of His kingdom.
