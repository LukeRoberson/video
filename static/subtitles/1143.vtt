00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:09.539
Empathy is a quality that is essential for effective disciple-making.

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:16.539
Interestingly, the word empathy doesn't occur in the main text of the New World translation,

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:23.539
but the idea is clearly conveyed in expressions like fellow feeling.

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:31.539
Jehovah and Jesus Christ are beautiful examples of ones who display empathy in their dealings with authors.

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.539
For example, Jehovah said to his people,

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:42.539
whoever touches you touches the pupil of my ahai, empathy.

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:51.539
And when Jesus was approached by a leper, begging to be healed, what was Jesus response?

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.539
The account tells us he reached out his hand, touched the man and said,

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.539
I want to, empathy.

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:12.540
Empathy is the ability to understand another person's thinking, feelings, concerns, anxieties.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.540
It may not come naturally, but it can be cultivated.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.540
The scriptures provide us with examples of individuals who were empathetic.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:32.540
For example, the Apostle Paul, who was a very effective disciple-maker, was also empathetic.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:40.540
Turn in your Bible, please, to 1 Thessalonians 2 and let's read verses 7 and 8.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:51.590
On the contrary, we became gentle in your midst,

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.590
as when a nursing mother tenderly cares for her own children.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:06.590
So having tender affection for you, we were determined to impart to you not only the good news of God,

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:16.000
but also our very selves, because you became so beloved to us.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
How did Paul approach his ministry?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Well, he says he was gentle.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:35.000
He displayed tender affection, and those who responded to the good news became beloved to him.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Paul uses a very powerful illustration, that of a mother caring for her children.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.000
In the human context, there is probably no more powerful example of empathy than that of a mother.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
She feels her child's pain.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
When her child rejoices, she rejoices.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
When her child weeps, she weeps.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Empathy.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:12.340
And did you notice, Paul said he was determined to impart not only the good news of God,

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.689
but his own soul.

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:20.689
Isn't it true as we help individuals today?

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:26.689
It's not a matter of only imparting the facts of the truth.

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:30.689
Bible students need help in many ways.

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:40.689
And like the Apostle Paul, we're self-sacrificing, willing to put the interests of others ahead of our own interests.

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:43.689
We're empathetic.

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:52.689
In the following dramatization, take note of how Nita provides practical assistance to her Bible student.

00:03:52.689 --> 00:04:09.870
It's fine. This is mine. My tree.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.870
Brilliant. Thanks. I didn't have any breakfast.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.870
So, we left off at paragraph 10?

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:26.750
Listen, I do have it in me today. I got like two hours sleep.

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.750
You are right. Just super stressed. I can't focus.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.000
I'm really sorry.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.439
My boyfriend, school, work, everything else.

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:45.439
I just don't even have time to breathe.

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:51.439
When my schedule gets a bit crazy, I focus on organizing what I can.

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:57.259
How about? I give everything a proper place.

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:00.259
Yeah, I'm not really the organisation type.

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:06.259
But I can help. I mean, if you want.

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:08.259
I guess a little help couldn't hurt.

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:12.259
So, how organised is your place right now?

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:24.939
Okay. Well, where should we start?

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:27.939
You're the neat freak. You tell me.

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:30.939
Let's try and find the bed. We'll work from there.

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:50.500
Did you notice how did Nita display empathy?

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.500
Well, she was observant. She was a good listener.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.500
And she offered practical assistance, didn't she?

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.500
She had some food for her Bible student.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:09.500
And at the end of the dramatisation, she was helping in other practical ways.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:15.500
And I think we would all agree she showed fellow feeling for her Bible student.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.500
You and I have to do these things as well.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.500
Be observant. What do you know about your Bible student?

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.500
What are the student's circumstances in life?

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.500
What is the student's family situation?

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.500
Does the student have hobbies?

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.500
Entrists? What is the religious background?

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.500
What does your student believe?

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:46.500
We'll be observant and ask good questions.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:52.500
And when you ask a question, give your student time to answer.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.500
What is our inclination when we ask our student a question

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.500
and the answer doesn't come quickly?

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:05.500
We tend to jump in to save our student,

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.500
but that approach isn't really helpful.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.500
When you ask a question, be patient.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:17.500
Allow the student time to think and to respond.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.500
And when the student responds, be positive.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.500
Commend the student for being honest, forthright,

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:29.500
even if the answer is not exactly what you were hoping for.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.500
And keep in mind as we observe and listen

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.500
and ask questions and display personal interest

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.500
we're very careful not to pry into matters

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.500
that are really not our business.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.500
And we don't want to show inappropriate interest

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:50.500
by becoming overly familiar with a Bible student.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:57.420
Does your Bible student need practical assistance?

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:01.420
Well, as we listen and observe,

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:04.420
we're in a position to share information

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:08.420
that will be truly helpful to the student.

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.420
Avoid the tendency, the temptation,

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:14.420
to give superficial advice.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:19.420
It's much better to meditate, do research,

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:24.420
and then you can give the student tailored Bible-based advice

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.420
taken from Bible-based publications

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:31.420
that specifically address the student's needs.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.419
And that is beautiful.

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:39.419
Be prepared too to explain how to apply the counsel.

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:42.419
People's lives are so complicated.

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:46.419
They face so many challenges they may not know.

00:08:46.419 --> 00:08:52.419
So explain but don't pressure.

00:08:52.419 --> 00:08:57.419
The best change always comes from the inside out.

00:08:57.419 --> 00:09:00.419
In other words, the Bible students' heart

00:09:00.419 --> 00:09:07.860
should motivate him or her to make necessary adjustments in life.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:13.860
Does your student need transportation to the Kingdom Hall?

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:15.860
Well, assist.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.860
It may be that you can provide transportation yourself,

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.860
or it may be a matter of helping the student

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.860
to know where the Kingdom Hall is

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:29.860
and then helping him to understand the public transportation system.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:34.860
But whatever help is needed, take those steps.

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:38.860
Ensure that your student has wholesome association.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.860
As time goes by,

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:44.860
your student is sure to lose former associates,

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:47.860
either because the student decides

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.860
or the former associates decide.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.860
Fill the void.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:56.860
And include your student in gatherings

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.860
in keeping with his spiritual advancement

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:03.100
and as appropriate.

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:07.100
Finally, show fellow feeling.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:10.100
Remember, empathy is not a technique.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:14.100
It's a quality that springs from the heart.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.100
And it's communicated in so many ways.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.100
Not just our words and our actions.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:24.100
Our facial expressions, our gestures, our body language

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:27.100
all communicate a message to the student.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:30.100
And the student will discern very quickly

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:35.100
if our words and actions are motivated by love.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:39.100
If they are, then we are demonstrating empathy

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:44.100
and reflecting the love and concern that Jehovah has for the Bible student.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:49.100
And that is what will draw the student to Jehovah.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:54.100
What a privilege we have to share in this vital disciple-making work

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:57.100
with Jehovah's help may each of us succeed

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:01.100
in showing the quality of empathy.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:05.100
Brother Gary Broho, a helper to the service committee,

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.100
will now present the final part of the symposium.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:12.100
Experience the joy of disciple-making.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:17.100
Improve your skills, reaching the heart.
