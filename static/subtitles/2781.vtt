00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.259
For many people just to hear the word slave leaves a bitter taste in her mouth.

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.259
They associate the word with the following definition, listen carefully to a please.

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:17.260
A human being who is owned as property by another and is absolutely subject to his will,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:23.260
or a bond servant divested of all freedom and personal rights.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.260
The word slave may bring to mind the trafficking in slaves,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.259
especially the buying and selling of blacks for profit prior to the American Civil War.

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:43.259
Well, that having been said, the Bible's use of the word slave does not leave a bad taste in our mouths,

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:46.259
but a sweet taste.

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:50.259
Yes, we were bought with the precious blood of another human, a perfect one.

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:53.259
We all know to be Jesus.

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:59.259
And Paul told the early Christians in Corinth, you do not belong to yourselves,

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:03.259
for you were bought with a price.

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:09.260
The 24 elders too in Revelation chapter 5, verse 9, sing to Jesus the Lamb of God.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
Open your Bibles, please, to this.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:19.260
That's the ninth verse of the fifth chapter of Revelation.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
And it reads this way.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:33.370
And they sing a new song, saying,

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.370
you are worthy to take the scroll and open its seals,

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.370
for you were slaughtered, and with your blood you bought people for God

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:48.370
out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.370
Well, that's true. That's what has happened, and we're all happy for that.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.370
But we all know that we're slaves of God.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.370
We have been bought and paid for, but we're happy slaves, aren't we?

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.370
We work diligently to please our owners, Jehovah and Jesus.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.370
And that's what Bethel is all about too.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.370
We work hard as slaves.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.370
To be a slave of Jehovah is a cherished privilege,

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.370
just to be owned by God, to belong to Him is the best thing that could happen to anyone of us.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.370
That is how the faithful and discreet slave feels as the feeding of the domestics

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.370
is accomplished each day.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.370
Now, you see members of the governing body walking here and there

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.370
in the various complexes here in the United States from the time to time.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.370
They were now and then we'll go up to Canada, go other places throughout the world,

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.370
and you see a few others walking around too.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:55.370
What are some things that occupy the time of the faithful slave and their attention?

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.370
I just jotted down a few things.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.370
Now, I'm going to go through them very fast because we don't have a lot of time,

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.370
but you just think about them.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.370
Making decisions that affect the lives of all sheep,

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.370
publishers of auxiliary regulars, special pioneers, missionaries, circuit overseers,

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.370
Bethel family members, all over the world,

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.370
deciding whether new branch facilities are needed in various countries throughout the world,

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.370
deciding on the needs in the field of computers, a field that just keeps growing

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.370
and growing with each passing week.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.370
Looking into legal fights where having all over the world,

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.370
deciding the best approach to helping brothers and sisters who have been struck by natural disasters,

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.370
how much money can be allotted and so forth,

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.370
deciding on assembly and convention program themes, dramas, broadcast programs,

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:52.370
videos, new songs, morning worship programs, involvement with all the schools being taught,

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.370
and there's no end to it.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.370
Reading and checking and approving all material that will be printed,

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.370
looking and approving all artwork that will be used in our publications,

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.370
what new languages to start translating,

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:12.370
decide on what will appear on JW.org and JW Library.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.370
And of course, that has really been a jewel and still is.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.370
Final approval on all the audio recordings of the Bible,

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.370
organizes international and special conventions,

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.370
organizes branched educations and assembly hall educations worldwide,

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.370
involved with all teaching, constantly looking to and praying to Jehovah for direction

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.370
and shepherding his sheep.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:44.370
Now what has been said probably is only half of what is done by the faithful and discreet slave.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.370
What is accomplished is not by human effort alone,

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:55.370
but is by means of God's Holy Spirit and direction given by Jesus the head of the congregation.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:01.370
While all major decisions and approvals are made by the faithful and discreet slave,

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:08.370
we have 30 most qualified helpers and several other brothers who work hard

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:14.370
in assisting us to accomplish our responsibility of feeding and caring for Jehovah's sheep.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.370
Their work does not go unnoticed.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.370
Now some of us may be viewed as iron chefs,

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.370
but we're not the only ones in the kitchen and you better believe that.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.680
The entire Bethel family helps as well.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.680
We hear you praying in our behalf on a regular basis,

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.680
and we thank you for your prayers.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.680
Is it any wonder that the Apostle Paul has found that monishing sheep to be industrious,

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.680
not lazy, be a glow with the Spirit, he says,

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.680
and then he ends up by saying slave for Jehovah.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.680
That's Romans 12-11.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.680
By becoming loyally obedient slaves of God and Jesus, we become their friends.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.680
Let's look at something here in our Bible.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:05.230
John 15-15.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:06.230
It reads this way,

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:11.230
I no longer call you slaves because a slave does not know what his master does,

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:17.230
but I have called you friends because I have made known to you all the things I have heard from my father.

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.230
Isn't that beautiful?

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:21.230
That's Jesus.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.230
That's what he does,

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.230
and we appreciate it so much what he does for us.

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:33.230
So those who follow Jesus while slaves are also his friends.

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.230
That's a blessing.

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:42.230
Can you think of a better position to be in than being a friend of Jesus?

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:47.230
If we have Jesus' friendship, then we automatically have Jehovah's friendship.

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:53.230
So don't let the word slave put a bad taste in your mouth.

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.230
It's a sweet thing.

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:58.230
It's honey to the palate.
