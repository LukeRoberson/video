WEBVTT

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:06.580
Well, we eagerly look forward to the fulfillment of 1st Thessalonians, chapter 5, verse 3,

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:07.580
don't we?

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.419
Just before Jehovah's Day begins, the nations will say,

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:16.500
peace and security, and then sudden destruction will come upon the wicked.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.899
This morning, let's remind ourselves about some of the key elements of this prophecy

00:00:20.899 --> 00:00:23.859
and its significance for us.

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:27.980
Please turn with me in your Bibles to 1st Thessalonians, chapter 5.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.539
This prophecy was written by the Apostle Paul to the Christians in Thessalonica, around

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:38.259
50 CE, and let's first notice the attitude of these Christians, as mentioned there in

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:40.259
verse 1.

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:47.579
1st Thessalonians 5-1, now as for the times and the seasons, brothers, you need nothing

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.939
to be written to you.

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:52.619
The zeal of these Christians was exemplary.

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:56.780
It was an example to other Christians in the 1st century, and it's a good example for

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:58.299
us today.

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:02.740
We can imitate the Thessalonian Christians by remaining alert to the times in which we're

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:08.420
living, remaining aware of God's timetable and not being distracted.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.780
Now why is that so important?

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.420
Notice verse 2.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.140
For you yourselves know very well that Jehovah's Day is coming exactly as a thief in the

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.340
night.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.180
Jehovah's Day refers to the period that will start with the destruction of false religion

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:32.140
and culminate in the war of Armageddon, like a thief in the night.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.340
In other words, unforeseen destruction will strike when least expected.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.019
Even true Christians who are in expectation may be surprised by its sudden start, but

00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:46.780
we won't be caught off guard.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.739
Why is that?

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:54.379
Well, because as true Christians, we keep in expectation, just as our comments for

00:01:54.459 --> 00:02:01.939
today mention, on the other hand, the world will experience much more than just a surprise.

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.420
Notice our prophecy here in verse 3.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.300
Whenever it is that they are saying peace and security, then sudden destruction is to

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.819
be instantly on them, just like birth pains on a pregnant woman, and they will buy no

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.060
means escape.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.020
Now the thought of humans achieving peace or wanting to achieve that peace, that isn't

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.259
anything new.

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:27.500
For example, what happened after the two world wars?

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.659
The nations wanted peace.

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:34.259
After World War I, the League of Nations was formed in the hope of bringing peace.

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:40.460
After World War II, the United Nations became a popular hope of bringing peace to mankind.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:46.300
Government and religious leaders looked to those agencies to bring about peaceful conditions.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.979
Many of us may remember back in 1986, the United Nations declaring the International Year

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:57.460
of Peace and Government and religious leaders joining the head of the Catholic Church to

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.500
offer prayers for peace.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.860
But neither that proclamation of peace and security nor others like it have been the fulfillment

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.500
of 1st Estilonians 5.3.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.500
Why not?

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.900
Well, for one thing, the foretold sudden destruction hasn't occurred yet.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.939
Also, the fulfillment has to be something striking enough to justify its being recorded

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:26.460
as a specific prophecy inspired by Jehovah.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.860
The peace and security proclamation must be an exceptional development, different from

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.490
the many peace efforts that have been made up until that time.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:43.210
But no matter what form the proclamation takes or how convincing it may sound, it will

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.009
only be a veneer.

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:49.009
The world will still be under the control of Satan.

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:55.409
And when you think about it, proclamations of peace won't make any real changes in people.

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:58.409
Those proclamations can't make people love one another.

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:00.090
They can't stop crime.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.610
They can't eliminate disease and death.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.530
Things that are needed to bring about true peace and security.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.569
The proclamation of peace and security won't mean that the decay of this old world has

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.050
been reversed.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:19.810
Timothy 313 says that wicked men and imposter will advance from what?

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.810
Bad to better?

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:22.810
No.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.410
Bad to worse.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.850
Certainly no improvement foretold there.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.569
Sadly many in the world will be deceived when they hear peace and security.

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:39.490
Destruction will strike when least expected, when their attention is on their hope for peace

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.970
and security.

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.410
But Jehovah's servants won't be deceived.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.769
Do you remember this image on our screens?

00:04:48.769 --> 00:04:53.089
It's in the October 2019 watchtower, and our picture description helped us to see what's

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:54.089
happening.

00:04:54.089 --> 00:05:00.290
It states, patrons at a coffee shop react to breaking news on television about a proclamation

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.410
of peace and security.

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.170
But we focus on the middle of that image, and what's happening there?

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:13.730
Description continues, a witness couple taking a break from field service are not fooled

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.069
by this report.

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:21.949
We won't be fooled because we listen when God speaks.

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:25.110
We listen when God speaks.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.790
And what does God tell us?

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.589
Psalm 4 verse 8, King David under inspiration wrote,

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:38.949
I will lie down and sleep in peace for you alone, O Jehovah.

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:41.550
Make me dwell in security.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.910
So true peace and security are only from Jehovah.

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:50.310
Any declaration of peace and security expressed outside the context of Jehovah's Kingdom

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.870
arrangement is counterfeit.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.910
It's as worthless as counterfeit money.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.029
That type of peace can't achieve anything of lasting value.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:06.310
Well, how do we benefit from understanding the significance of this prophecy?

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:13.730
Please notice verse 4, but you, brothers, you are not in darkness so that the day should

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.769
overtake you as it would themes.

00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:21.569
Unlike people in general, we discern where current events are heading.

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:26.370
Jehovah doesn't keep us in the dark regarding these significant events.

00:06:26.769 --> 00:06:32.569
Actually, he dignifies us by kindly giving us advanced knowledge in the form of a general

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:37.209
outline of events that are going to occur in the future.

00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:41.930
Would we expect anything less from our loving father?

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.970
I thought this was nicely highlighted in a quote in the Awake magazine some years ago.

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:54.050
A branch received a letter from a 77-year-old Catholic monk who explained this.

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.569
I do not agree with all your beliefs, but what I read today in the watchtower makes

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:03.490
me admit that you have your finger on the pulse of time.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:09.889
You courageously and legitimately explain Paul's words at 1 Thessalonians 5-3.

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:12.649
And I'll notice what else he states.

00:07:12.649 --> 00:07:16.370
No where in our church do I find such explanations.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:23.449
A person cannot dispute the workings of Holy Spirit upon Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:29.689
Jehovah dignifies us by kindly granting us advanced knowledge.

00:07:29.689 --> 00:07:33.449
Now since we're not in darkness regarding future events, as mentioned there in verse

00:07:33.449 --> 00:07:35.529
4, what more is required of us?

00:07:35.529 --> 00:07:37.490
What's required of you and me?

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.649
Notice verses 6 and 8.

00:07:40.649 --> 00:07:48.209
So then, let us not sleep on as the rest do, but let us stay awake and keep our senses.

00:07:48.209 --> 00:07:49.610
Verse 8.

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:55.410
But as for us who belong to the day, let us keep our senses and put on the breastplate

00:07:55.410 --> 00:08:01.209
of faith and love and the hope of salvation as a helmet.

00:08:01.209 --> 00:08:07.370
Therein verse 6, and speaking of us, Paul was obviously referring to genuine Christians

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:14.490
who are active and responsive to Jehovah's direction spiritually awake to God's purpose.

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:19.410
The rest mentioned here would be persons perhaps professed Christians who are spiritually

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:24.529
asleep and unconcerned about the coming destruction.

00:08:24.529 --> 00:08:25.529
Verse 8.

00:08:25.529 --> 00:08:29.730
Likens faithful servants of God to well-trained soldiers who are attentive, who have

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:36.610
on their protective armor, and who are ready to obey any command given by their leader.

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:42.409
See we're not like unprepared troops sleeping in the barracks during a time of danger and

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:44.769
urgency.

00:08:44.769 --> 00:08:48.049
And even though we don't know just when the proclamation of peace and security will

00:08:48.049 --> 00:08:52.009
be made, that doesn't lessen the need for alertness today, does it?

00:08:52.009 --> 00:08:58.210
In fact, it greatly increases and heightens the need for all of us to be awake, watchful,

00:08:58.210 --> 00:08:59.809
and ready.

00:08:59.809 --> 00:09:05.090
Are not knowing the exact time requires that we be ready all the time?

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:09.620
Well, what if we consider?

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:14.059
We can imitate the Thessalonian Christians by remaining alert to the times in which we're

00:09:14.059 --> 00:09:19.899
living, remaining aware of God's timetable and not being distracted.

00:09:19.899 --> 00:09:24.899
No matter what form the proclamation of peace and security takes or how convincing it may

00:09:24.899 --> 00:09:27.580
sound, it will only be of a near.

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:33.139
We won't be fooled because we listen when God speaks.

00:09:33.139 --> 00:09:38.779
And even though we don't know when the proclamation will be made, we stay alert, not knowing

00:09:38.779 --> 00:09:44.139
greatly increases and heightens the need to be spiritually awake.

00:09:44.139 --> 00:09:50.299
May we all remain watchful and ready as the proclamation of peace and security draws
