00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:08.000
Well, the time has come for the main talk of this graduation program.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.960
It's going to be given by a member of the governing body, brother Gage Flegal.

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:17.760
Now, what's his theme again? What's that theme again?

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.079
Oh, I know. To whom do we belong?

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:29.920
I'm not going to sing for you. To whom do we belong?

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:36.560
When was the last time you said to yourself, I belong to Jehovah.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.520
Maybe it was during the singing of song number 40 that we just concluded.

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:45.759
It's important for all of us really to think about our dedication vow.

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:50.079
Why? Because it helps us to focus on what's really important.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:57.439
Our relationship with Jehovah. During this talk, we're going to discuss why belonging to Jehovah

00:00:57.439 --> 00:01:05.040
is the most secure place to be. But we want to start off by discussing how we also belong to

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.079
the Christian congregation. And really, in what sense is that the case?

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:12.959
Well, I invite you to open to 1 Corinthians chapter three.

00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:20.560
And first, a little bit of context. Beginning in chapter one, the Apostle Paul reveals that

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.079
the congregation in Corinth was divided. There were divisions in the congregation.

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:32.079
Some Christians were expressing favoritism. Some said, I belong to Paul. Others, I belong to

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:40.879
Apollo. Others, I belong to Cephas or Peter. Why? Well, those men had remarkable qualities and

00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:50.540
abilities. But should they have focused on them so much? They had remarkable abilities in

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.219
teaching or in shepherding. Maybe the brothers in Corinth were heard saying, Apollo,

00:01:54.219 --> 00:02:01.819
this is my favorite speaker, or Paul is my favorite missionary, or Peter is my favorite shepherd.

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:11.020
He sold down to earth. What was Paul's inspired council? We find it in verses 21 through 23.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.379
1 Corinthians chapter three, verses 21 through 23. He said, so that no one boasts in men

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:26.060
for all things belong to you. Whether Paul or Apollo's or Cephas or the world or life or death

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:33.020
or things now here or things to come, all things belong to you. In turn, you belong to Christ,

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:43.310
Christ in turn belongs to God. Let no one boast in men. What's the point? The Christians in

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.750
Corinth really had no basis to say that they belong to Paul or Apollo's or to Peter. Instead,

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:55.150
it was the other way around. That was the reality. All things belong to you. All things belong to

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.830
the congregation, the Christian congregation. That is, all things God has made or arranged are at

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:08.990
the disposal of Christians for their benefit. Paul, Apollo, and Cephas were all working

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:15.229
unitedly to build up the Christian congregation. They all belong to the congregation as a gift from

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:24.750
God to help the congregation for the congregation's well-being. Where do we fit in these verses?

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:32.750
Where do you fit as Gilead soon to be graduates? How will that help you in your new assignments?

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:40.349
Well, we too are part of the collective Christian congregation to which all things belong, and that's

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:45.389
a comforting thought. What does that mean? Well, circuit overseers, field missionaries, congregation,

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:53.550
elders, Bethelites are a gift from Jehovah for our encouragement for the benefit of the congregation.

00:03:56.539 --> 00:04:02.939
But we can turn that around as well. The opposite is true. Just like Paul, Apollo's and Cephas,

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:09.979
we too as our individuals belonging to the congregation. We are gifts from God for their well-being.

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:18.300
What does that mean? Well, simply put, at times we receive encouragement, at times we give encouragement

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:25.899
to others in the congregation. The Apostle Peter later wrote in 1 Peter 4 verse 10 to the extent

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:33.100
that each one has received a gift, use it in ministering. Now the Greek word rendered ministering

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:39.019
literally means serving. So ministering to one another, serving one another as fine stewards of

00:04:39.019 --> 00:04:49.839
God's undeserved kindness, that is expressed in various ways. So each of you has a gift. Each of

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:57.920
you is a gift to the congregation. So continue to let Jehovah use you to help others. We can be

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:03.600
expressions of Jehovah's loving kindness, undeserved kindness to fellow believers, but only if we act

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.970
in their behalf. Now there's something else that Paul mentioned in this verse. He said,

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:17.329
in turn, you belong to Christ. Christ is head of the Christian congregation. So the congregation

00:05:17.329 --> 00:05:23.810
is like a body, and the head controls the movement of the body. The head directs all the parts of

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:33.089
the body, how to move, how to perform work. So do we personally choose our assignments? Where do we

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:40.769
serve? Granted, we might pursue particular goals or avenues of service, but do we choose our

00:05:40.769 --> 00:05:47.310
assignment and Bethel service? When I first came to Bethel, I had the idea that I wanted to work in

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:56.670
construction or in the art department. I was assigned to the binary. If we view each assignment as

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:01.310
coming from Jehovah or from Jesus Christ as the head, it will help us to be content and happy.

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:06.189
What about a new circuit over here? Does he get to choose where he wants to serve?

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:14.110
What about a newly appointed field missionary? Does he select the country or the city where he will

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:21.629
serve? You know the answer to that. We might compare to air traffic control at a major airport.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:29.790
Jesus directs us through the organization when to take off and where and when to land.

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:37.759
Jesus might also tell us you're grounded. Maybe we're not ready for flight. Maybe we need to

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:45.920
refuel. Maybe it's time to retire the plane, but Jesus is in control. In New York, New Jersey,

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:57.120
nearly 1,200 flights passed through the airport every day. Total of 36,387 in August 2023.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:02.480
That requires tremendous organization and coordination. They have to work around rainstorms,

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:10.079
snowstorms, windstorms, not just at the local airport, but in other places throughout the country too.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:19.360
Well, what would happen if there was no air traffic control? Collisions damaged to aircraft

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:26.480
life might be lost? Complete chaos. There certainly would be problems.

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:32.079
What about the Christian congregation? Well, Jesus is the perfect leader and commander,

00:07:32.079 --> 00:07:36.160
and we do our best to follow his direction. Think about the tremendous amount of work.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:41.600
An organization involved in training and appointing branch committee members, circuit overseers,

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:47.040
congregation elders, ministerial servants, regular pioneers, not to mention the organization

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:54.160
of theocratic schools as well. Gilead, the school for kingdom evangelizers, school for congregation

00:07:54.160 --> 00:08:02.959
elders, pioneer service schools, many others that requires organization and coordination. What we

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:11.360
might call tremendous air traffic control, aren't we glad that we belong to an organization with Christ

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:19.040
as the head? But at times it calls for personal sacrifices. The pilot can't tell air traffic

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:25.439
control when and where he wants to land. It requires personal sacrifices on his part. The August

00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:32.000
1st, 1998 watchtower contained this life story of brother George Couch, a name familiar to us.

00:08:32.639 --> 00:08:37.200
While serving in the circuit work in 1957, brother Couch and his wife were invited to serve at

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:44.480
Bethel instead. And brother Couch received some very pointed counsel from brother Noor, his first

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:50.159
day at Bethel. What did brother Noor tell him? He said, you're not a circuit servant anymore.

00:08:50.159 --> 00:08:55.120
You are here to work at Bethel. This is the most important work that you have to do and we

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.039
want you to put your time and energy into applying the training you receive here at Bethel.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:05.919
Brother Couch related the first assignment I had was in the magazine and mailing departments.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.840
Later, after about three years brother Noor informed me that the real reason I was brought to

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:16.559
Bethel was to work in the home. You are here to run the Bethel home, he said.

00:09:18.559 --> 00:09:24.080
While during those first three years brother Couch must have wondered why in the world he was

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:28.399
taken out of the circuit work to work in the magazine and mailing department.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:40.980
But Jesus knew why, brother Noor knew why, and looking back on that, we know why too.

00:09:42.179 --> 00:09:46.019
Brother Couch was dearly loved as the Bethel home overseer for many decades.

00:09:46.659 --> 00:09:51.539
Incidentally, the title he chose for his life story is, we have done what we ought to have done.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:57.539
A sterling example for all of us. So what have we learned to this point?

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:04.259
All things belong to you, all things belong to the congregation. We are servants to our brothers

00:10:04.259 --> 00:10:10.580
and sisters. We care for one another as belonging to the same body. The Apostle Paul expressed that

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:18.899
well at Romans 12 verse 5. We are members belonging to one another. And you as a Gilead class have

00:10:18.899 --> 00:10:23.620
already demonstrated that. You have rallied around one another. You have rallied around

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:29.620
Bethelites who have gone through difficult trials in their life. And we also learned that you

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:34.179
belong to Christ, the head of the Christian congregation, Christ Jesus determines how when and

00:10:34.179 --> 00:10:42.500
where we might serve best. So yes, we belong to the congregation. And we can be confident that

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:47.940
any future assignments that we receive, there will be brothers and sisters there that we can

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:54.820
share that with. We can encourage. We can strengthen. We will find joy in ministering to others

00:10:54.820 --> 00:11:00.899
just as Paul, Apollo's and Peter found joy in serving their Christian brothers as well.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:10.000
Let's consider our second point now though. We belong to Jehovah. Do you remember the day of your

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:17.120
baptism? Do you remember the smell of the water? If it was in an assembly hall maybe chlorine,

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:22.879
if you were baptized in the sea, maybe there was a salt smell, maybe the temperature of the water

00:11:22.879 --> 00:11:30.720
was what struck you the most. What about the baptism talk? Or the baptism questions? Well, every year

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:38.450
we're reminded of the questions three times, right? Two assemblies and one convention. Have you

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:45.809
repented of your sins? Dedicated yourself to Jehovah and accepted his way of salvation through Jesus

00:11:45.809 --> 00:11:53.090
Christ. And second, do you understand that your baptism identifies you as one of Jehovah's witnesses

00:11:53.090 --> 00:12:00.210
in association with his organization? Well, before hundreds, perhaps thousands of people,

00:12:01.649 --> 00:12:08.129
of course the most important witnesses being in the heavens, we answered yes to those questions.

00:12:08.129 --> 00:12:12.049
And then we were baptized. And how we made Jehovah's heart rejoice on that day.

00:12:13.009 --> 00:12:18.210
But dedication is a personal choice. Our parents can't make that decision for us. Our Bible

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:24.610
teacher can't make that decision for us. Dedication to Jehovah is personal. And why do we dedicate our

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:31.409
life to Jehovah? Because we love him. We love his organization. Because we learned about his

00:12:31.409 --> 00:12:39.169
beautiful personality. And during Gilead, you've learned many more reasons to love Jehovah and his

00:12:39.169 --> 00:12:47.009
organization. So how do we now feel about our God? Perhaps as described in Isaiah chapter 44,

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:56.620
Isaiah 44, notice with me verse five, and see if this reflects your feelings towards Jehovah.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:05.340
Isaiah 44, five, one will say, I belong to Jehovah. Another will call himself by the name of Jacob.

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:11.580
And yet another will write on his hand, belonging to Jehovah. And he will adopt the name of Israel.

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:19.899
Belonging to Jehovah written in permanent ink, we can't tell Jehovah that our dedication was a

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:26.860
mistake. No, we've attached ourselves to the Almighty God. What a privilege that is to belong to

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:34.860
the only true God. We're proud to bear his name, Jehovah. And at times like this, we might echo

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:41.740
the words of Joshua, as for me and my household, we will serve Jehovah.

00:13:43.419 --> 00:13:50.059
Well, question is, how does that make Jehovah feel about you, that determination to continue

00:13:50.059 --> 00:13:58.940
serving him? If you're still there in Isaiah, notice chapter 43 verse one. Now this is what Jehovah

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:04.059
says, your creator, O Jacob, the one who formed you, O Israel, do not be afraid for I have repurchased

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:13.620
you. I have called you by your name. You belong to me. You belong to me. Of course,

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:17.539
Jehovah here is speaking about his people as a whole, but he knows us individually.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:25.059
Second Timothy 2 verse 19 tells us directly, Jehovah knows those who belong to him.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:31.620
He has a personal attachment to each of us. That's how Jehovah feels about all of his precious

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:39.649
servants. That's how Jehovah feels about you. Well, does dedication to Jehovah mean that

00:14:39.649 --> 00:14:51.600
life is without trials? What do you think? No? We've all experienced trials. But what assurance can we

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:58.240
have during those trials? Right there in Isaiah chapter 43, notice verse two, Jehovah's personal

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:06.000
assurance. It says, when you pass through the waters, I will be with you. And through the rivers,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
they will not flood over you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be scorched,

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:19.120
nor will the flame cinch you. I wonder if Han and I, Michelle and Azariah had those words in mind

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:28.370
as the King Nebuchadnezzar condemned them to the fiery furnace. But what's the point? Jehovah

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:35.570
doesn't promise to remove trials, but he says, I will be with you in the flood, in the fire.

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:41.809
Jehovah can quiet our fears so that we can endure them, so that we can maintain our integrity

00:15:41.809 --> 00:15:47.490
to him, even in the face of death. Well, how does that play out in real life?

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:53.330
Let's consider one of Jehovah's precious servants in our modern day history. Sister Valentina

00:15:53.409 --> 00:16:01.409
Gatunovskaia. Now, she was one of many witnesses in Russia who kept her integrity despite severe trials.

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:08.690
In 1945, when she was about 20 years old, her brother witnessed to her, and he made two return

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:15.730
visits, but then she never saw him again. Well, what did she do with her limited knowledge of the truth?

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:21.090
She started preaching. She began to preach to her neighbors. And as a result, she was arrested

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:29.789
in sentence to eight years in the labor camp. In 1953, she was released and right away

00:16:29.789 --> 00:16:35.629
resumed her preaching work. Again, she was arrested and imprisoned this time for 10 years. Now,

00:16:35.629 --> 00:16:41.870
the picture shows Valentina with a group of sisters in a labor camp during her second imprisonment

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:52.419
around 1959. Well, what happened next? 1967, Valentina was again set free, and she was finally

00:16:52.419 --> 00:17:00.750
able to symbolize her dedication to Jehovah by water baptism. Incredible. All of that, preaching,

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:07.869
being imprisoned, despite actually having been baptized. But that's not the end of the story.

00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:13.630
In 1969, she was again arrested. This time, she was sentenced to three years in prison. Still,

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:20.269
she kept on preaching. Before she died in 2001, she helped 44 people to learn the truth.

00:17:20.269 --> 00:17:25.470
She had spent 21 years in prisons and camps. And at the end of her life, Valentina said,

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:29.470
I never had my own place to live. All my possessions were in a single suitcase.

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:40.670
But I was happy and content in serving Jehovah. What's the lesson? Jehovah knows those who belong to

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:46.990
him. And he cares for them, even in the flood or in the fire. In recent years, the fire of persecution

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:54.509
has started to grow again in Russia. Here's a collage of nearly 700 of our brothers and sisters

00:17:54.509 --> 00:18:03.410
in Russia who have been persecuted for belonging to Jehovah. One of the sisters in the collage

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:10.029
named Ludmila is currently in prison. And what was her so-called crime, according to the court

00:18:10.029 --> 00:18:18.799
document, describing the attractiveness of serving Jehovah? Shame on the authorities

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:25.970
for persecuting our dear sister. These dear ones are precious to Jehovah. He is watching over them,

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:30.130
even if they're currently in prison. Through his word, Jehovah says that, and personally, you

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:39.680
belong to me, I will be with you. For these dear ones and all of us who belong to Jehovah,

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:47.599
we find a very interesting verse later in Isaiah chapter 43, verse 13. It says, also, I am always

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:54.480
the same one, and no one can snatch anything out of my hand when I act who can prevent it.

00:18:55.599 --> 00:19:00.319
So when I act who can prevent it, Jehovah says, no one can snatch anything out of my hand. Now

00:19:00.319 --> 00:19:06.880
previously, the New World translation said here, there is no one affecting deliverance out of my hand.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:13.440
In other words, when Jehovah acts against his enemies as he did against ancient Babylon, as we

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:22.319
note in verse 14, no one can turn back his hand. But the current rendering, no one can snatch anything

00:19:22.319 --> 00:19:29.039
out of my hand, made me think of Jesus' words in John chapter 10. John 10 verse 29, Jesus said,

00:19:29.039 --> 00:19:37.869
no one can snatch them or Jesus' precious sheep out of the hand of the Father. That's a secure

00:19:37.869 --> 00:19:45.230
place to be in Jehovah's hand. How might we illustrate this? Well, let's use an example from

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:53.390
Jehovah's creative works, a grizzly bear, a mother grizzly bear. She's super protective of her

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:57.869
for cubs. Will she care for them? Or I'll just try to get between her and her cubs and you'll

00:19:57.869 --> 00:20:04.349
find out real fast. One reference says, mother bears are affectionate, protective, devoted,

00:20:04.349 --> 00:20:11.470
strict, sensitive, and attentive with their young. Bears can be empathetic, fearful, joyful,

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:20.829
playful, social, and altruistic. Well, what about Jehovah? If a mother bear is protective and

00:20:20.829 --> 00:20:27.549
devoted, how much more so is Jehovah interested in each one of you, each one of all of us?

00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:36.880
Our brothers and sisters in Russia included. If we live or if we die, we belong to Jehovah.

00:20:38.079 --> 00:20:42.079
That's a secure place to be. Never would we want to do anything to hurt our loving Father and

00:20:42.079 --> 00:20:48.799
take ourselves out of Jehovah's hand. Rather, may we continue to live up to our dedication to him.

00:20:49.759 --> 00:20:57.839
So what have we considered to whom do we belong? We belong to the Christian congregation,

00:20:57.839 --> 00:21:01.039
a beautiful international brotherhood of fathers, mothers and sons,

00:21:01.759 --> 00:21:06.880
mothers, sisters, daughters, brothers as well, all belonging to one another.

00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:11.759
We belong to Christ, the head of the Christian congregation, who provides direction in our service

00:21:11.759 --> 00:21:18.640
to Jehovah. Tells us when to take off, where to land. We belong to Jehovah, our God, the benevolent

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:26.559
Father of a loving universal family. So may we always treasure our precious place among Jehovah's

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:32.240
people. And as you go to your assignments, please be assured of our continued love and support.

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:54.619
Well, that was just a beautiful talk. You know, I just thoroughly enjoyed the whole program. How about

00:21:54.619 --> 00:22:13.710
you? Well, now we're going to distribute the diplomas to the class. So I'm going to be helped by

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:18.670
Brother Ron Kurzen here. He's going to announce the students where they're going to go,

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:23.390
and I'm going to try to hand them the diplomas and shake their hands.

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:30.029
Well, to get started, we have brother and sister Shimon. We'll return to the Turkey A branch.

00:22:39.809 --> 00:22:43.410
Brother and sister Cunningham have been assigned to the Peru branch.

00:22:53.009 --> 00:22:56.690
Brother and sister Dylan have been assigned to the Greece branch.

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:10.500
Brother and sister Figlinski will return to the United States branch.

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:22.769
Brother and sister Gamblegaard will return to the Scandinavia branch.

00:23:30.819 --> 00:23:34.019
Brother and sister Lee will return to the Philippines branch.

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:46.980
Brother and sister Labern have been assigned to the Georgia branch.

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:59.420
Brother and sister Mannyani will return to the Uganda branch.

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:11.940
Brother and sister Mikhailovich will return to the Slovenia branch.

00:24:20.799 --> 00:24:23.920
Brother and sister Pafilis will return to the Greece branch.

00:24:32.059 --> 00:24:35.180
Brother and sister Podmonitski will return to the Hungary branch.

00:24:43.539 --> 00:24:46.740
Brother and sister Hossa will return to the Portugal branch.

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:58.680
and brother and sister Rosanne have been assigned to the United States branch.

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:10.490
Brother and sister Silvosa will return to the Spain branch.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:20.950
Brother and sister Silvester will return to the Britain branch.

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:34.109
Brother and sister Torres have been assigned to the Central America branch.

00:25:34.109 --> 00:25:45.789
Brother and sister Ben Marl will return to the Suriname branch.

00:25:45.789 --> 00:25:57.890
Brother and sister Varsi will return to the Argentina branch.

00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:18.599
and brother and sister Vishone will return to their Croatia branch.

00:26:18.599 --> 00:26:22.599
Brother and sister Walens have been assigned to the Bulgaria branch.

00:26:22.599 --> 00:26:34.700
Brother and sister Wilson will return to the Bulgaria branch.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:51.190
Behold, the 154th class of Gilead.

00:26:51.190 --> 00:27:17.839
It's a good-looking bunch here.

00:27:17.839 --> 00:27:22.839
Well, as usual, the class would like to express appreciation

00:27:22.839 --> 00:27:25.839
for the training that has been received,

00:27:25.839 --> 00:27:30.839
and so Traci Figlinski is going to represent the class in a class letter.

00:27:30.839 --> 00:27:40.039
To the governing body.

00:27:40.039 --> 00:27:45.039
For 80 years, the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead has trained faithful men and women

00:27:45.039 --> 00:27:50.039
to courageously preach the good news and strengthen the brotherhood.

00:27:50.039 --> 00:27:55.039
When we first arrived, the thought of living up to that legacy seemed daunting,

00:27:55.039 --> 00:27:58.039
but our training has changed that.

00:27:58.039 --> 00:28:01.039
It took the focus off of ourselves.

00:28:01.039 --> 00:28:05.039
Here in this beautiful environment, we were privileged to gather together

00:28:05.039 --> 00:28:11.039
beside the still waters of truth and recount the righteous act of Jehovah.

00:28:11.039 --> 00:28:16.039
The school's first registrar, Brother Schroeder, said that students of the Gilead school

00:28:16.039 --> 00:28:23.039
are taught that Jehovah's word is absolute in its supremacy and unlimited in its scope.

00:28:23.039 --> 00:28:27.039
We are now thoroughly convinced of that fact.

00:28:27.039 --> 00:28:34.039
The mere mention of the name Shira Jashib is a reminder for us that God's word always comes true.

00:28:34.039 --> 00:28:40.039
As recorded in the Book of Daniel, there is no one who can hinder Him.

00:28:40.039 --> 00:28:45.039
How we enjoyed discovering the treasures concealed in Christ.

00:28:45.039 --> 00:28:48.039
Elements of the ransom took on new meaning.

00:28:48.039 --> 00:28:53.039
An unhurried look at His interactions with others has changed our approach to Bible reading

00:28:53.039 --> 00:28:57.039
and more importantly, people.

00:28:57.039 --> 00:29:00.039
There is much more to learn and many adjustments left to be made,

00:29:00.039 --> 00:29:07.039
but we feel ready to do our part to reflect the love Jehovah and Jesus have for mankind.

00:29:07.039 --> 00:29:13.039
Our love and appreciation for you, the governing body, also grew as we saw the way you care

00:29:13.039 --> 00:29:16.039
for the interests of our Master Jesus.

00:29:16.039 --> 00:29:24.039
By your humble reliance on God's Spirit, you keep pace with Jehovah's chariot and help us to do the same.

00:29:24.039 --> 00:29:30.039
It is our singular honor to support you in these momentous last days.

00:29:30.039 --> 00:29:36.039
Though we are anxious to get to our assignments and apply what we learned, we will miss being here at Patterson.

00:29:36.039 --> 00:29:41.039
We have come to dearly love our instructors and their wives as well as the rest of the Bethel family.

00:29:42.039 --> 00:29:47.039
The welcome we received and the way we were looked after made us feel right at home.

00:29:47.039 --> 00:29:49.039
Thank you.

00:29:49.039 --> 00:29:55.039
Our experience here has fundamentally changed the way we think about ourselves and our God.

00:29:55.039 --> 00:29:58.039
The Psalmist beautifully express how we feel.

00:29:58.039 --> 00:30:04.039
Teach me, O Jehovah, the way of your regulations and I will follow it to the end.

00:30:04.039 --> 00:30:12.819
Your fellow workers, the 154th pass of duty.

00:30:12.819 --> 00:30:48.519
I don't think Tracy is the only one who feels the emotion of the moment.

00:30:48.519 --> 00:30:59.519
Well, you know when Gilead students are asked to discuss the impact that the class has had on them.

00:30:59.519 --> 00:31:05.519
We see the same thing class after class and your class was no exception.

00:31:05.519 --> 00:31:09.519
They don't focus on the academics.

00:31:09.519 --> 00:31:18.519
But they really focus on the impact that the chorus has had on them as spiritual people.

00:31:18.519 --> 00:31:22.519
How it has drawn them closer to Jehovah.

00:31:22.519 --> 00:31:27.519
How it's helped them to become better Christians.

00:31:27.519 --> 00:31:30.519
And that's just wonderful to see.

00:31:31.519 --> 00:31:40.519
For you, the study of the Bible, it hasn't been a matter of learning a lot of facts and figures so you could answer written exercises.

00:31:40.519 --> 00:31:51.519
But during the course, you have allowed the Word of God to mold you, to influence you, to change you for the better.

00:31:51.519 --> 00:32:05.519
Now in your study of God's Word, you have seen how much affection Jehovah has for widows and orphans, for those who can't speak for themselves.

00:32:05.519 --> 00:32:19.519
So if any of you get a measure of authority in the future, use that authority to give a voice to those who have no voice.

00:32:19.519 --> 00:32:27.519
Now unlike college graduates who graduate from university and then they close the books and then they never open them again,

00:32:27.519 --> 00:32:31.519
you folks are going to continue to study God's Word.

00:32:31.519 --> 00:32:41.519
For the purpose of allowing it to mold you, to become even better men and women, even better Christians,

00:32:41.519 --> 00:32:51.519
you're just a wonderful group, we're proud of you, we love you, and we pray that Jehovah will richly bless you.
