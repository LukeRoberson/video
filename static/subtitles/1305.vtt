Here at Walkill, we have two rotary presses, each prints something called a signature, which is virtually the same as a 32-page brochure.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.420
The press can print up to 94,000 signatures per hour.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:29.420
If these were stacked on top of each other, they would reach the height of a 30-story building every hour.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.950
The process begins with a 3,000 to 4,000-pound roll of paper.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.950
It's loaded along the press, rolled into place, trimmed, and lined with double-sided tape.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.950
Before the previous roll is finished, the new roll is loaded onto the splicer.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.950
By means of double-sided tape, this roll is attached to the expiring roll.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:05.859
Next, the paper advances to the four print units, which apply ink on both sides of the paper at the same time.

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:09.859
The presses use a technique called offset printing.

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:19.859
This process uses printing plates designed to allow water to repel ink from the non-image areas, and attract ink to the image areas.

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:31.569
The plate then transfers the ink to a rubber blanket, which then transfers the ink to the paper.

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:34.569
Four colors of ink are used to create the images.

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:39.569
They are black, cyan, magenta, and yellow.

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:42.569
The ink on the paper is applied in tiny dots.

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:47.569
By using this technique, a wide range of colors can be achieved.

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:58.000
Now, the paper goes through the dryer, which maintains a temperature of around 400 degrees Fahrenheit, 200 degrees Celsius.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Solvents from the ink are evaporated inside the dryer.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Next, in order to set the ink so that it will not smear, the paper travels through a series of rollers filled with chilled water.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Now that the ink is dry, the paper is folded and cut.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.280
Finally, the conveyor brings the cut signatures out of the press, and they are checked for quality.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.659
They are then processed and distributed to the carnations.
