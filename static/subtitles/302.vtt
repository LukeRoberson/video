00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:31.469
Pioneering where the need is greater wasn't easy.

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:40.909
After a long day in service, I had a part to work on.

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:46.909
Thankfully, just to care of everything so I could focus on my part.

00:00:46.909 --> 00:01:11.879
She's the best. Poor thing. She was exhausted.

00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:15.129
Good thing we were turning in early.

00:01:15.129 --> 00:01:23.859
William and I couldn't agree on much lately.

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:28.659
We couldn't afford this.

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:48.890
There had to be something cheaper, but he wouldn't listen.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:02:00.989
Sometimes I feel my husband doesn't make the best decisions.

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:04.989
I just wish he'd value my suggestions.

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:13.659
Frankly, I've given up trying.

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:18.659
Just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him Lord.

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:25.659
Hebrews chapter 11 and Isaiah chapter 51 also cite Sarah as a fine example for Christian wives.

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:31.659
But Christian husbands can also learn much from carefully examining.

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:50.539
Sarah's example for me.

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:54.539
Sarah was willing to move to parts unknown.

00:02:54.539 --> 00:03:09.000
A life fraught with danger and hardship.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:25.009
She unselfishely supported Abraham no matter what.

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:35.979
Just like my Jessica, she does without.

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:38.979
Never complains.

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:40.979
What a gem.

00:03:40.979 --> 00:04:07.500
I can do better, letting her know just how precious she is to me.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.500
Sarah submissively obeyed her husband.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:45.410
But she also spoke up.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.410
She loved her son.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.410
And she knew what was at stake.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:58.459
God's promises through Isaac, even though she knew it would upset Abraham.

00:04:59.459 --> 00:05:15.540
She spoke up.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.540
She must have thought carefully before speaking to him.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.100
After all, she called him Lord.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:30.790
Jehovah blessed her for her loyal support of Abraham.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.790
Even reminding him to listen to her.

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:44.620
I knew I couldn't expect Jehovah to whisper in my husband's ear.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.620
Did my speech show respect?

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.620
Like Sarah?

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.600
I needed to tell him how I felt.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:59.060
But I needed to do it the right way.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.060
That night, we spoke.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:10.579
And little by little, things started to improve.

00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:14.579
Imitating Sarah really worked.
