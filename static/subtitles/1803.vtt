WEBVTT

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.560
It's my privilege to interview a three-former traveling all this year's, and what we hope

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:15.839
to accomplish in this interview can really be summarized here in Proverbs chapter 27 and

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.920
verse 17.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.920
Follow as I read it, Proverbs 27 verse 17.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.679
It says, as iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens his friend.

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:36.000
So it's true you can take a file that's made of iron and use it to sharpen a blade that's

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.359
also made of iron.

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:43.719
And so the Proverbs says, so it is, a man can sharpen his friend.

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:49.640
If you notice the footnote, it literally says, can sharpen the face of his friend.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.960
Now what does that mean?

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.439
Well the Hebrew word for face actually includes the term countenance.

00:00:57.439 --> 00:01:04.640
And so the experience of one man can sharpen the spiritual countenance of another.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.319
And that's what we hope to accomplish here.

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:12.200
These brothers have decades of experience in the circuit and district work.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.959
And so listen to the trials and challenges that they had to face, how they threw their

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:23.400
burdens upon Jehovah and especially how he sustained them.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.040
And as you do so, it will help you to fortify your own desire and determination to stick

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.120
with your assignment and it will help sustain you through trials that you too will face.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.519
Now let's get familiar with these brothers.

00:01:36.519 --> 00:01:43.599
I would like to introduce them first of all, Brother Jerry Murray, Brother Felice Episcopo

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:46.840
and Brother Rodney Thompson.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.159
Now brothers we'd like to know a little bit about you, Brother Murray, could you tell

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.519
us some of your background?

00:01:52.519 --> 00:02:01.359
When my mother started studying in 1946, I got baptized myself in 1954, started pioneering

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:02.359
in 1960.

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:10.159
My wife and I were invited to the 41st class of Gilean in 1965 and we were assigned to

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:15.120
what was then called British Guiana and later Guyana.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.120
And we were there for about five and a half years.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.520
I had some health problems.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.240
We were reassigned to a special pioneer assignment in Grenada, Mississippi.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.199
And we were there about two years and then in 1973, I started back in the traveling

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:32.199
work.

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:39.639
Very good, until recently, until September when we were transferred to special pioneering.

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:43.199
Brother Episcopo, what about some of your background?

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:47.719
We were grateful the day that an anointed witness of Jehovah knocked on our door in Summit

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:48.719
New Jersey.

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:56.039
And my mother came into the truth in 1945 and made us study, thankfully.

00:02:56.039 --> 00:03:04.639
And so I was baptized in 1950, pioneering in 1953 and had the privilege of attending Gilean,

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:07.680
the 26th class in 1955.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.680
From there, after Bolivia, 1956, the circuit worked in Argentina, 59, the circuit in District

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.680
work.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.400
And then 1964, we had a change of assignment.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.439
We started to raise a family, had to come back to the United States.

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:26.680
Each decade proved a different challenge.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.560
50s, missionary service, 60s, parenthood, 70s, we served with the need was greater in Spain

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.039
with our two boys, 80s, RBC, and then international construction.

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:41.639
In 90s and 2000s, traveling work and teaching.

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:44.599
And now in 2015, special pioneer service.

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.719
A very good, rich history.

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:48.800
What about you, Brother Thompson?

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.280
I was five years old when my dad learned the truth.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.879
And I got baptized when I was 12 years old in 1953.

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:03.919
And in 1959, upon graduation from high school, I started as a regular pioneer.

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:10.840
In 1962, I was called into Bethel's service, milestone in my life.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.120
And served there for four years.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.800
And then upon leaving to get married, I was interested in the traveling work.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:24.120
And I was told, go out, special pioneer for about six months, and they said, we'll see.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.319
So we special pioneered a year and a half.

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:32.839
And we were invited in the circuit work in 1968.

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:38.399
And I've had the privilege of serving in the circuit work, in the district work,

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:41.040
ministerial training school.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:47.639
And the last year, 46th year, as a field instructor.

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:52.759
And then September 1, this year, we were assigned to the special pioneer work.

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:56.560
Well, all of you very rich, theocratic history.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.000
In fact, I combined over 150 years of full time service.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.920
Quite commendable.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:08.480
Now, we would like to hear some challenges or trials that you've faced throughout those years.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.439
Brother Murray, could you start for us?

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:13.279
It's interesting in the work we had a lot of travel.

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:14.920
We've always had a lot of travel, of course.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.199
That's why it's called traveling work.

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:22.879
And in South America and Guyana, we would sometimes travel for weeks and never ride in a car.

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:29.920
We'd ride by plane, a boat or some other way.

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:33.639
As far as accommodations, they were very humble in Guyana.

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:38.160
They were also very humble here in this country at times, but also very luxurious at times.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.480
But there's something that both places had in common.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:48.279
The brothers always provided us the best they had, the best they could.

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:50.519
And it's interesting.

00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:55.519
Sister Murray and I spent over half of our career in the traveling work in homes.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:01.120
And some of our strongest, most enduring relationships were built with people

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.839
that we stayed with in their homes over the years.

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:09.839
And quite frankly, I strongly recommend that as a way to really strengthen your relationship with the brothers.

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:14.879
Now, you're telling me another challenge you faced last minute assignments from the branch.

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:20.839
As an example, last year, on a Thursday, the first week in the service year,

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:22.480
I got a call early in the morning.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:29.519
I mean, before seven, from the branch asking me if I could go to Wisconsin to fill in for a district overseer.

00:06:29.519 --> 00:06:31.720
And that was on Thursday.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.839
I said, when do you want me to go?

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:36.839
They said, I want you to go tomorrow for the weekend.

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:39.360
I didn't have the talks up.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.399
And there were four talks I had to get up.

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:45.839
So I did what seemed to be the easiest thing.

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:48.480
I called some traveling brother friends and said,

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.399
similar outlines, it'll help me get my talks up.

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:52.519
They did.

00:06:52.519 --> 00:06:57.879
And I think that's the benefit of having a strong relationship with your fellow traveling brothers.

00:06:57.879 --> 00:06:59.560
Help me get your talks up.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.319
Absolutely.

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:02.240
Very good. Thank you.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.240
Brother Piscopo, some challenges that you faced.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:10.519
And believe it, when I entered the circuit work in November of 1956,

00:07:10.519 --> 00:07:13.000
the main mode of travel was on trucks.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.399
And the whole country, which is two and a half times the size of California, was my circuit.

00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:24.120
We only had five congregations in the whole country, the rest were isolated groups.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:28.759
And I had the privilege of introducing the truth into a number of villages.

00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:32.120
There were challenges, but I was young and strong.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:40.439
Our great challenge came in 1964 when we had to leave our precious assignment and start parenting.

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:46.120
And I must admit that I wasted about a year feeling sorry for myself.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:49.399
Until I started to hear my own negativity.

00:07:49.399 --> 00:07:53.319
And with Jehovah's help, I said, get on with it.

00:07:53.319 --> 00:07:55.720
There's life after children.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.879
And sure enough, we worked and pursued the goal of getting back into this.

00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:04.759
And in 1986, after our boys were raised, we were ready to get back into this.

00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:09.560
We were able to get back into the special full-time service.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.000
Beautiful.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.079
Brother Thompson, some of your trials and challenges?

00:08:15.079 --> 00:08:20.920
I'd like to relate this experience when waiting for an assignment upon leaving Bethel.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:27.959
And my wife said, there are two places I don't want to go because of the social issues.

00:08:27.959 --> 00:08:31.160
Mississippi and Alabama.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.159
Well, Alabama was the first assignment.

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:38.360
And Mississippi was the third assignment.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:43.639
And we loved it because Jehovah's molded us and trained us.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:50.519
It was a beautiful experience that helped us to be prepared for the work he had assigned for us to do.

00:08:50.519 --> 00:08:57.320
And on a list of challenges, I would say dealing without aging parents is one.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:01.480
And also health concern on my part.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:10.120
In the case of my mother-in-law, it proved to be a time of great anxiety for Vernees

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.240
since she couldn't be there to give her assistance.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:17.480
Although she had a brother and two sisters that looked after her.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:22.039
And in my case, my brothers and sisters, I'm the oldest of eight.

00:09:22.039 --> 00:09:25.080
They were very supportive to me in my work.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:31.240
And if there was a crisis with my parents, I was the last to know about it.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.200
They resolved things and then they would inform me.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.840
And I appreciated that so much.

00:09:36.919 --> 00:09:46.519
With my concern as health, it was, I guess about eight and nine years ago, I was diagnosed with prostate cancer.

00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:50.279
And so the organization was very supportive.

00:09:50.279 --> 00:09:56.120
I was wondering, worried about the expense of it, how it would be cared for.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:03.799
And so they let me decide a certain treatment, a robotic surgery that happened in Alabama.

00:10:03.799 --> 00:10:06.200
And not a worry at all.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:10.759
So I never lost any sleep or concern over it.

00:10:10.759 --> 00:10:15.159
And I appreciate to this day the support the branch office provided.

00:10:15.159 --> 00:10:17.000
Good. Thank you, brothers, for your expression.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.360
Obviously, you've, in your wives, have dealt with various trials.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:26.519
Maybe you can explain to us, how have you thrown your burdens upon Jehovah?

00:10:26.519 --> 00:10:30.679
And how has he supported you through these times?

00:10:30.679 --> 00:10:32.200
Brother Murray?

00:10:32.279 --> 00:10:37.960
Well, in 1996, I began to get very sick and doctors couldn't figure out why.

00:10:38.679 --> 00:10:41.000
It continued on into the spring of 1997.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.559
I was working with a, my district was here, brother Samuel, heard.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:50.919
And I was so sick that I'd work one door, go lay down, go work another door.

00:10:51.559 --> 00:10:54.600
Finally, brother heard, told me he thought I was crazy to keep on trying.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.600
And he pushed me into calling health care.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:01.399
And a rainbows were made for me to go to Cleveland Clinic for diagnosis.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.720
Turns out I had scleroderma.

00:11:04.519 --> 00:11:08.440
And it was a very bad case of scleroderma, which is an autoimmune disease.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:15.399
Then we didn't, Sister Murray and I had always believed that we would be young

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:20.679
when the paradise came. So we hadn't set much aside materially.

00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:26.759
And when I think about it now, I'm really not sure, I know what happened,

00:11:26.759 --> 00:11:28.360
but I'm not really sure how it happened.

00:11:29.159 --> 00:11:33.399
That anything we needed, we always had.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.879
We had the special pine year allowance which covered the utilities and the apartment rental,

00:11:37.879 --> 00:11:41.159
but we always had about a $400 a month shortfall.

00:11:41.799 --> 00:11:47.720
Brothers would write notes, they'd write get-well cards, and there'd be $10, $15 in it.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.799
We always had exactly what we needed.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:56.440
The only explanation I can think of is that your Hover made sure that we were taking care of,

00:11:56.919 --> 00:11:59.960
and of course, the branch played a major role in that, too.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.519
Brother Piscopo?

00:12:02.919 --> 00:12:07.320
The second round that started in 1986 in the Special Full-Time Service,

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:11.159
the challenge has been taking care of older family members.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:18.600
And at times it became so intense that I thought we would have to give up our special privilege,

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:23.000
but we received help from brothers like Brother Firdida, who said,

00:12:23.639 --> 00:12:27.320
you can work it out. They've taken care of several older people.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:33.639
And with Jehovah's help, in a lot of prayer, we've been able to do it and provide to this day,

00:12:33.639 --> 00:12:41.320
and one of the complexities of our rotating into special pine year services we have to provide for

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:48.440
four, not just for two. And I also am now facing a health challenge for the first time in my life,

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:55.639
a cancer diagnosis. But I have the full confidence that Jehovah will see us through this challenge

00:12:55.639 --> 00:13:00.870
as he has the others. Brother Thompson, what's helped sustain you?

00:13:02.789 --> 00:13:08.789
One scripture that I draw a lot of encouragement from is Jeremiah chapter 29, verses 11 and 12.

00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:15.750
And I take that scripture personally when Jehovah said, I have thoughts I'm thinking about you,

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:25.190
speaking to me, and thoughts of peace and night calamity, thoughts of a future, and a hope.

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:34.309
And he said, you will call, and you will pray, and I will listen. And I believe that fervently.

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:41.509
There have been questions in our lives. There have been challenges, problems that we didn't have

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:49.669
solutions for. We just waited and see how Jehovah would work it out, and it always worked out

00:13:49.669 --> 00:13:53.190
favorably on our behalf. And for that we are truly grateful.

00:13:54.309 --> 00:14:01.029
Excellent. Perhaps you three brothers could touch on what has helped you to stick with your

00:14:01.029 --> 00:14:04.309
assignment through these many years. But Brother Thompson, you want to start?

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:12.389
The joy of serving. I think Brother Murray mentioned it earlier.

00:14:14.789 --> 00:14:23.990
It's not the position, but it's the privilege of service. As he mentioned, we recall circuit servants

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:32.549
at one time. And when you are able to help people, and they respond, that's gratifying. In fact,

00:14:32.629 --> 00:14:40.789
one question that we often get is, do you remember me? And most of the time we don't.

00:14:40.789 --> 00:14:45.190
But often when the friends approach us like that, they will recount something you said,

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:53.110
something you did that touched them, and they benefited from. And that's very rewarding.

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:58.149
And that has kept us going. Brother Piscopo, how would you answer that question?

00:14:58.149 --> 00:15:03.269
Well, the love of the work, of course, it's a very rewarding work to serve our brothers and sisters.

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:09.909
But the challenges of moving and everything of that nature, I have a good wife.

00:15:10.549 --> 00:15:17.269
She was a missionary in her 20s, and she never quit being a missionary, even through child raising

00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:25.590
all these years. And she's ready to go all the time. No complaints. The only thing she's ever

00:15:25.669 --> 00:15:33.269
demanded is a good theocratic schedule. And brother Murray? First, the truth is, your heart is still

00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:39.590
in the missionary work, too. Right? You know it's interesting. The brothers really nailed it.

00:15:40.549 --> 00:15:47.110
What this work is all about is serving your brothers and servings your whole. And so the nature of

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:51.990
the work, when you love your whole, and you love your brothers, that's what keeps you going,

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:54.710
and that's what makes you want to do it, and left to do it so much.

00:15:55.509 --> 00:16:00.549
Brother Bro, may I say eight men to what brother Piscopo said on good wife.

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:07.509
Good wife that is supportive, is you can't do it without them.

00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:14.389
Very true. I know all of your wives, and that truly can be said about each of those dear sisters.

00:16:15.669 --> 00:16:20.549
Now, each of you also have been now transitioned into a special pioneer work.

00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:27.909
And that transition has caused some anxiety. We'd like you to maybe address your feelings,

00:16:27.909 --> 00:16:32.230
how it worked for you, and perhaps even give some suggestions for other brothers that

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:36.070
will be turning 70. Brother Murray, let's start with you this time.

00:16:36.789 --> 00:16:41.269
Well, the biggest challenge that I faced was really quite psychological.

00:16:43.029 --> 00:16:48.710
For over 40 years, I had had a very tight schedule, arranged for me by the branch,

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:51.590
they were telling me where to go, when to go, what to do on a got there.

00:16:52.629 --> 00:16:57.269
And it's interesting now, all of a sudden, all that's behind me. The last year in the

00:16:57.269 --> 00:17:02.789
traveling work, I had two district assignments. I taught five weeks of elder schools. I was

00:17:02.789 --> 00:17:09.109
chairman of the convention, taught two pioneer schools, served my circuit, and now that's behind me.

00:17:09.109 --> 00:17:13.829
Like my brother said, that's the work we love very much. So it was a big adjustment.

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:18.789
I felt a little bit out of the loop, too, because I wasn't privy to the information

00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:24.950
that I used to have. So I had to make some adjustments. What helped me to make the adjustment was

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:32.230
simply basically one sentence in the departure letter saying that the governing body made this

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:39.029
decision on the basis of love. And I truly believe that, because I began to realize how my

00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:45.430
health had deteriorated. My energy level had dropped. I could do the meetings, I could give the

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:52.630
talks, but what I could not do well was I couldn't do a long, long day in service. And that's what the

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:56.950
work is all about. It's to help the brothers with the ministry preaching the good news of the kingdom.

00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:03.750
So when I accepted that, and then it really did, it really helped me to make the adjustment.

00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:09.589
Now, what I would say to brothers making the adjustment is you have a little time to plan,

00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:16.869
you have a little time to think about what you're going to do. And I would certainly do that.

00:18:16.869 --> 00:18:20.789
Think about where you want to settle. And personally, I would recommend settling

00:18:21.589 --> 00:18:26.309
where you are known, where you have friends, maybe where you have served, if that's possible.

00:18:27.509 --> 00:18:33.430
Also, think about why the governing body made these adjustments, and the benefits that are going

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:41.029
to come to the congregation. And I would even spend some time remembering or reminiscing about the

00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:47.349
good times we've had and the joys we've had. I think Paul did that, because in his last letter,

00:18:48.069 --> 00:18:53.829
the second Timothy, he said, I have fought to find the fight. So evidently, he was thinking

00:18:53.829 --> 00:18:59.589
about the joys and privileges that he had in the ministry. I would do all those things, I think.

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:02.390
Thank you very much. Are you proud of your Piscopal?

00:19:03.109 --> 00:19:09.750
Well, in my case, we've enjoyed all of these beautiful assignments, and it's sort of a sense of loss.

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:18.950
You're leaving something behind. I won't be in the loop anymore as I had been. But I feel a great

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:27.190
sense of the governing body, really governing. And in our case, this is a good head start,

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:32.950
because we're going to be governed in the new world. So my recommendation is follow the

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:39.829
governing of the governing body. And if it means a change in assignment, so be it. Get used to it.

00:19:39.829 --> 00:19:46.150
This is what we're going to have. And thankfully, because when Caesar's gone, we're going to need to be

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:55.190
governed. Brother Thompson. And I'm thankful that I was very busy right up until the end.

00:19:57.349 --> 00:20:03.910
I had, it was involved in a Bible school for Christian couples. Then we had the International

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:11.750
Convention. I did three Pioneer Service Schools, and that took me all just about all the way up

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:19.829
until it was time to move. So I didn't get a chance to dwell on the anxiety of a new assignment.

00:20:19.829 --> 00:20:26.230
And then I was able to shift easily from that assignment into the special, special Pioneer

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:32.549
Works. That proved to be a blessing for me. And as Brother Murray said earlier, that if we

00:20:32.549 --> 00:20:40.150
can go and serve, go and settle where we've served before, then we're going to find the friends

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:47.190
that are supportive. That was true. In my case, I settle in a district two districts ago. So the

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:54.309
friends knew me. They provided a kingdom hall apartment for me and very supportive. And that

00:20:54.309 --> 00:21:00.470
helped us to make that transition. Could I add this point, Portwood? I just been talking about,

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:08.390
you also have to learn how to be in a congregation. We have been supervising as we're obviously

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:16.069
in congregations in circuits. Now you're another elder, part of a body. And I had to actually look

00:21:16.069 --> 00:21:21.670
up and see how to do things that elders do, had refreshed myself. I also had to learn how to be a

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:27.269
good, special pioneer. And I concentrated on that. For example, for 40 years, I'd gone on other

00:21:27.269 --> 00:21:34.470
people's studies, gone on return visits and had not too many of my own. Now I've got to try to

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:41.910
learn to do that and do it well. So there's a lot to keep you busy. In that same vein, even though I

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:50.230
made that mistake in 1964 of lamenting, this time I'm looking forward to the new things, being a

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:54.710
real elder in a congregation of body. And one of the things I want to do as an ex-traveling

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:59.829
man is to assure those brothers that I'm not there to compete with them. I really look forward

00:21:59.829 --> 00:22:05.670
to being a member of their body of elders and taking my part about the things I've been teaching

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:11.509
for so many years. I look forward to having a Bible studies and I'm going to tap what the slave

00:22:11.509 --> 00:22:17.349
has encouraged us to do. The unbelieving husbands I've had success in that before and I'm looking

00:22:18.309 --> 00:22:20.630
forward to studying with a few of them, maybe bring them into the truth.

00:22:21.269 --> 00:22:27.670
I mean, I had something brother, brother, and that is one of the things that my wife appreciated,

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:34.470
you wouldn't believe it, is having the paragraphs read in the Watchtower study on Sunday.

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:42.309
For decades, it's been Watchtower summaries, abbreviated Watchtower when the circuit

00:22:42.309 --> 00:22:49.109
oversees visit and she has thoroughly enjoyed that. In fact, I was assigned since I've been where I

00:22:49.109 --> 00:22:55.589
am now, the assignment to read the paragraphs of the Watchtower. And when I came off the platform,

00:22:55.589 --> 00:23:01.829
one day brother asked me, what was the last time you read the Watchtower? It was a joy, I enjoyed it.

00:23:01.829 --> 00:23:06.950
That's beautiful. Thank you. What about housing, brothers? That usually provides some anxiety.

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:12.869
How did that work out for you, brother? This is a big challenge because we have to accommodate

00:23:12.869 --> 00:23:19.349
four people, not just two. And we've already done some reconnaissance and it's not easy

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:27.349
to start all over again after the slave has provided a roof over your head for the past 29 years.

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:33.829
So we are confident that Jehovah will help us. It's an unsolved problem, but we feel it will be

00:23:33.829 --> 00:23:38.630
solved. We've got to work at it, but the blessing of Jehovah will come.

00:23:39.509 --> 00:23:47.029
Brother Thompson, what about your situation? In my case, there was a kingdom hall apartment

00:23:47.829 --> 00:23:59.029
that the elders made available for me and my wife. And they went in there and they repainted the

00:23:59.029 --> 00:24:08.390
whole place and they provided all that we needed in order to get settled. And they continued to do

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:15.990
that week after week and supporting us in having a place to stay. That's beautiful. Brothers,

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:21.430
we really do want to thank you for the rich history that you've had and sharing your

00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:27.269
expressions with us. And please be assured, we prayed Jehovah's blessings upon each of you and

00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:32.869
your wives as you now continue in your special full-time service as a special pioneer.

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:39.509
It has been very refreshing. Hasn't it to hear the experiences of these brothers?

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:47.750
It's just like the proverb says, iron sharpens iron. And it's true that a spiritual man can help

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:53.349
to sharpen the face of another spiritual man. So we do appreciate the expressions of these

00:24:53.349 --> 00:25:01.029
brothers. And as you move ahead in your spiritual life, you're going to have trials and challenges

00:25:01.029 --> 00:25:07.990
to face. What's going to sustain you during those times? One thing we'd like to mention,

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:14.150
most of you will have one of these former traveling overseers in your circuit. They'll be serving

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:20.710
you special pioneers. Benefit from their wisdom, spend time with them, learn from them.

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:27.190
Another thing that'll help sustain you is to benefit from your fellow traveling overseers around you.

00:25:28.309 --> 00:25:34.390
Sometimes you may have some issue, you need to discuss with another traveling overseer,

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:42.309
meet him on a Monday or make a phone call. His words of counsel or recommendations or suggestions

00:25:42.309 --> 00:25:50.470
can be beneficial to you. Also, remember the branches here to assist you. It may be a conversation

00:25:51.029 --> 00:25:56.230
you have with a member of the branch committee, or maybe the service desk in the service department.

00:25:56.950 --> 00:26:01.029
Those brothers will always be there to sustain you and to help you where they can.

00:26:02.309 --> 00:26:08.150
But most of all, please remember Jehovah will always be there to sustain you.

00:26:08.869 --> 00:26:15.349
There's a beautiful scripture we'd like to conclude with and 1 Samuel 12 and verse 22.

00:26:16.309 --> 00:26:24.069
Listen to what it says. For the sake of his great name, Jehovah will not abandon his people.

00:26:24.869 --> 00:26:29.509
For Jehovah has taken it upon himself to make you his people.

00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:34.789
So brothers, we encourage you stick to Jehovah as these brothers have.

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:41.910
Lean upon him. He will sustain you through all of your challenges and trials that you'll face

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:48.549
as a circuit overseer. And you too will receive many blessings of service as you move ahead

00:26:48.549 --> 00:26:50.549
in your sacred service.
