WEBVTT

00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:16.070
We are involved in the greatest preaching campaign in all history.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.109
How can we most effectively handle this weighty assignment?

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:26.190
In 1 Corinthians 926, this profound statement was made.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:33.030
The way I am aiming my blows is so as not to be striking the air.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.609
Under the governing body's direction, the service committee has sought ways to help us

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:45.329
focus our blows, that is our time and energy, so that we can reach as many people as possible

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.450
since the time left is reduced.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.630
To help us in this regard, adjustments to our preaching work were announced at the 2017

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.649
annual meeting.

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:03.649
Around the world, our brothers and sisters have seen wonderful benefits to supporting these

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:05.250
adjustments.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.370
The governing body is adjusting the focus of our ministry.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:16.370
For many years, there was a focus on placing magazines, developing magazine routes.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.890
However, that is not the focus of our ministry.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:28.170
We have so many tools, it can be overwhelming and confusing, so we only need so many tools

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.930
in the box.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.129
Jesus commanded, go there for and make disciples.

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:45.530
That's the focus of our work, searching for those rightly disposed for everlasting life.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:57.150
This is a time for decision, or looking for people that will act on what they learn.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.269
This new arrangement has helped me to focus more in directing the householder's attention

00:02:02.269 --> 00:02:09.069
to the Bible and helping them to look into their own Bible, instead of just relying on

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.310
what literature says.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.030
Some religious people will never accept our literature, but now, I direct the attention

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.750
to the Bible, and they are more inclined to listen, and what is more, some new publishers

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.830
are improving their skills in the ministry and is even helping them to spend longer time

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:28.830
in their service.

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:39.129
So, I would like to say thank you, plenty to the government for this.

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:44.530
Because only a few publications are featured in the ministry, repairing for presentations

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.210
has become a lot easier.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:53.650
And since you use these presentations often, soon, you are able to memorize them.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.009
And you can avoid the situation where you needed a publication, rummaging to your

00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:02.009
preaching bag for a long time, only to find out that it's not there.

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:07.009
But now you can be very sure, since they are organizing the teaching toolbox, it's

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:09.050
so easy to find them.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:17.439
Just one tap, and there is the publication you are looking for.

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:22.960
Because of this adjustment, preparing for my presentations has become a lot simpler.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.479
Whatever publication that I choose to use helps me in starting Bible studies.

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:33.039
This of the videos, and the publications, and the teaching toolbox, it is now quite

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:37.680
a bit easier to start conversations any time.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.719
Before it was kind of hard to pinpoint what really suits the needs of the household.

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:46.319
But now there is a guarantee that you have something to use.

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.159
And this is easy to find in the teaching toolbox.

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:57.289
And the preaching bag that I used to preach in conduct Bible studies has become more handy.

00:03:57.289 --> 00:04:02.689
I'd like to express my sincere and heartful thanks to the governing body.

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:08.409
The teaching toolbox has helped me to make my ministry simpler, but more effective.

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:18.839
I'm very excited to continue using this toolbox so I can help more people.

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:21.040
I took immediate action.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.360
I discontinued a number of unproductive Bible studies, so that I could concentrate

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.040
my focus on ones who showed genuine interest.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.879
That means they would prepare well for their Bible study.

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:40.839
They would attend meetings or are making plans to do so.

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:46.360
Maria had studied the Bible on and off for a number of years, and once again expressed

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.759
the desire to reinitiate her Bible study.

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:56.000
So I explained to her the new arrangement to direct our focus only on individuals who

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.680
had a genuine interest in serving Jehovah.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.800
So immediately she started attending meetings, and now she witnesses informally to her family

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.680
and to neighbors.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:16.199
Our focus has been channeled in one direction, making disciples.

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:22.519
Have you personally seen the benefits as you've applied these adjustments in your ministry?

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:28.680
As we effectively aim our blows, we can be assured of Jehovah's support and blessing.
