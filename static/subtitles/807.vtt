WEBVTT

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.099
Jehovah is with you, you mighty warrior.

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:11.820
With those words, Jehovah's angel greeted faithful judge Gideon.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.419
But his reply to those words might surprise you.

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:16.780
Would you open your Bibles?

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.379
Let's read together, Judges, chapter 6, verse 13.

00:00:21.379 --> 00:00:24.859
That's Judges 6, verse 13.

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.260
At this, Gideon said to him,

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:30.219
pardon me, my Lord.

00:00:30.219 --> 00:00:35.820
But if Jehovah is with us, why has all of this come upon us?

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.020
Where are all his wonderful acts that our fathers related to us saying,

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.539
did Jehovah not bring us up out of Egypt?

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:52.060
Now Jehovah has deserted us and given us into Midian's hand.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.179
Well, is that how you would respond to an angel of Jehovah who is speaking to you?

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.500
Well, probably not, under normal circumstances.

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:04.780
But what about in 2020?

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.659
This has truly been an incredible year.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:17.900
We have faced a pandemic, a pandemic that has robbed us of our dear loved ones,

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:26.700
a pandemic that has caused us to face isolation to be separated from our relatives and close friends

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.579
so that now an epidemic of anxiety has settled down across our earth.

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:40.459
At times, during this year, maybe you have felt like Gideon.

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:42.939
Maybe his words have been your words.

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.099
Well, what does that mean?

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:51.019
If you have said those things or felt those things, does it mean that you're lacking faith?

00:01:51.019 --> 00:01:54.379
Does it mean that your love for Jehovah is disappearing?

00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:58.459
Or that now you're sort of diminishing in your relationship with God?

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.140
Not at all.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.019
Gideon was not the only faithful of servant of Jehovah who expressed similar thoughts.

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:09.340
Do you remember what Habakkuk said?

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.099
Let's open our Bibles.

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:18.050
Let's read together Habakkuk, chapter one, and verses two and three.

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:22.620
Habakkuk said,

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:29.419
But you do not hear.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.099
How long must I ask for help from violence?

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.180
But you do not intervene.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.379
Why do you make me witness wrongdoing?

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.939
And why do you tolerate oppression?

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:44.860
Why are destruction and violence before me?

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.979
And why do quarreling and conflict abound?

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.060
Why, why, why?

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:58.780
Well, maybe those words sound a little bit familiar to you.

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:06.300
But brothers, when we feel overwhelmed by our circumstances, by our grief,

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:12.620
by our anxiety, there is a question that we need to ask.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.580
Now, this is a question that was first recorded in the Bible

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:20.539
from the faithful prophet Elisha.

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:22.219
Now, would you read it with me?

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.020
It's in 2nd Kings, chapter two,

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:27.819
and verse 14.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.659
2nd Kings 2,

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:31.900
and verse 14.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.379
It says, then he, now this is Elisha, then he

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:40.860
took the official garment of Elijah that had fallen off him

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.099
and struck the waters and said,

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.900
Where is Jehovah, the God of Elijah?

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:53.340
When he struck the waters, they were divided to the left and to the right

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:56.939
so that Elisha went across.

00:03:58.139 --> 00:03:59.020
What is the question?

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:02.300
Where is Jehovah?

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.539
Now, what did Elisha mean when he asked that question?

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.340
Was he saying, where is Jehovah?

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.020
Why isn't he doing something?

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:13.180
Is that the sense of the question?

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.620
Not at all.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.699
Elisha was looking for Jehovah.

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:21.259
He was searching for his direction.

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:23.980
He wanted to see the hand of God.

00:04:25.019 --> 00:04:28.139
Well, Elisha got the answer to his prayer.

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:33.019
Those waters opened right in front of him so that he could cross.

00:04:34.459 --> 00:04:38.300
Well, this is not the only place where this question appears in the Bible.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.819
Let's look at another place.

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:41.740
Here in Jeremiah, chapter 2.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.300
Jeremiah, chapter 2, and verse 5.

00:04:50.459 --> 00:04:51.819
This is what Jehovah says.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.620
What fault did your forefathers find in me so that they strayed so far for me

00:04:59.339 --> 00:05:03.420
and they walked after worthless idols and became worthless themselves?

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:05.899
They did not ask, now notice,

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.980
they did not ask, where is Jehovah?

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.259
The one who brought us out of the land of Egypt,

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:15.259
who led us through the wilderness,

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:17.100
through a land of deserts and pits,

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.740
through a land of drought and of deep shadow,

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.819
through a land where no man travels,

00:05:22.459 --> 00:05:25.259
and where no man humans dwell.

00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:27.819
What's the point?

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.180
Jehovah wanted his people to search for him.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:41.180
But he wanted them to ask, where is Jehovah to look for his hand to seek his help and direction?

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:47.899
When our brothers why is it so urgent for us during these critical times,

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:51.579
during a pandemic, to be saying, where is Jehovah?

00:05:53.100 --> 00:06:02.620
Because we so desperately need the help, the direction, the support, the comfort that come

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.620
from our amazing, our wonderful God, Jehovah.

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.500
But now you might say, well, is Jehovah really going to help me?

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.300
You? Is Jehovah really going to help me?

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.379
I'm not important. I'm not significant.

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:18.459
Is Jehovah really going to be there for me?

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:24.779
Well, look at these beautiful words in the scripture in Isaiah chapter 57.

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:31.740
Isaiah chapter 57, which is really a promise from our God, Jehovah.

00:06:33.579 --> 00:06:35.819
Isaiah 57 verse 15 says,

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:44.860
for this is what the high and lofty one says, who lives forever and whose name is holy.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.459
I reside in the high and holy place, but now notice this.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:07:00.779
But also with those crushed and lowly in spirit to revive the spirit of the lowly

00:07:01.579 --> 00:07:05.259
and to revive the heart of those being crushed.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.699
What an amazing thought.

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:12.699
Here are our God, Jehovah, the Almighty, who dwells in the highest heavens,

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:20.860
says that when we are crushed, when we are lowly, in a figurative sense, he resides right with us.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.420
How beautiful, how amazing.

00:07:24.379 --> 00:07:26.779
Well, now what does that mean? What does that teach us?

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:32.540
It teaches us we need to ask that question, where is Jehovah every day?

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:37.019
We need to beg Jehovah for his direction. We need to beg him for his help.

00:07:37.819 --> 00:07:40.939
But then we need to do something more.

00:07:40.939 --> 00:07:45.019
We need to be on the lookout for the hand of Jehovah.

00:07:46.459 --> 00:07:52.139
When Elijah felt completely isolated, when he was so discouraged, do you remember?

00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:58.779
He said, I'm the only one left. He just poured his heart out to Jehovah.

00:07:58.779 --> 00:08:06.220
And what did Jehovah do for him? Well, you'll remember, Jehovah allowed Elijah to see a miraculous

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:13.180
display of his power. Remember, he saw he felt that wind. He felt the earthquake. He felt the fire.

00:08:14.939 --> 00:08:18.459
But you know, the Bible says, Jehovah was not in the wind.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:23.100
Jehovah was not in the earthquake. Jehovah was not in the fire.

00:08:24.779 --> 00:08:34.700
But then what came next? A calm, low voice. That was Jehovah.

00:08:35.899 --> 00:08:38.460
Well, now what do we learn from that experience?

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:46.299
Sometimes brothers, we might be waiting for some big, bold, dramatic expression of Jehovah's hand.

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:54.059
But in reality, what do we need to do? We need to turn up our spiritual hearing aids

00:08:54.059 --> 00:09:04.059
so that we can hear the calm, low voice of Jehovah. You see, Jehovah's answer to our prayers

00:09:04.059 --> 00:09:10.139
might come in a way that we don't expect. Maybe it's through the kind gesture or act

00:09:10.139 --> 00:09:15.419
of one of our brothers or sisters. Maybe it's through a text message, an email,

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:22.299
a phone call, or some other way that our brother or sister acts to show their kindness.

00:09:22.299 --> 00:09:30.059
Maybe that's Jehovah's way of giving us the help that we need. That means that when we are

00:09:30.059 --> 00:09:36.139
earnestly praying, when we're earnestly seeking Jehovah's help, be attentive, be alert,

00:09:36.139 --> 00:09:42.779
ask where is Jehovah and look for his hand. But now here's another question, brothers.

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:49.820
When that help comes, when Jehovah does provide that assistance that you need,

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:57.659
will you be willing to accept it? When Mary came to Jesus with the perfumed oil,

00:09:57.659 --> 00:10:04.860
genuine art. Remember so expensive that it would cost a year's wages for an average laborer.

00:10:06.059 --> 00:10:12.460
It would have been so easy for Jesus to turn her away. Just say, oh no, Mary, thank you very

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:18.700
much, but I don't need you. A Jehovah's going to help me so you can just go now and I'll be fine.

00:10:20.059 --> 00:10:29.340
Jesus didn't do that. Jesus willingly accepted the help. Now maybe, maybe Jesus understood that

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:35.100
Jehovah had put it into Mary's heart to do this so that his body would be properly prepared for burial.

00:10:35.179 --> 00:10:44.379
We don't know, but the point is Jesus accepted the help that Mary provided. Well, brothers and sisters,

00:10:45.419 --> 00:10:52.539
what's the lesson? What do we need to learn from this? If you're a person who always says, oh no,

00:10:52.539 --> 00:10:59.340
we're fine. We don't need anything. Jehovah's going to help us or oh no, you don't need to tell me

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:05.820
that. I already know Jehovah will give me the direction I need. Well, then we may be missing out.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:15.899
We may not be seeing or hearing the help that Jehovah wants to give us. Let's watch a video

00:11:15.899 --> 00:11:22.779
and see how our brothers and sisters in distress have experienced the help of Jehovah at a critical

00:11:22.779 --> 00:11:31.970
time. I thought that fire was loud. I thought that you could hear a wildfire and it was just

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:37.889
dead quiet. By the time we went down the driveway and around the corner, we stopped and looked back

00:11:38.929 --> 00:11:47.889
and back of my parents' houses on fire. When the pandemic hit, we lost our work. We couldn't go to

00:11:47.889 --> 00:11:57.490
work and we also couldn't leave our apartment. The situation was very hard. My husband Yvonne was

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:04.370
charged with organizing extremist activity. He was put into pretrial detention for four months.

00:12:06.289 --> 00:12:12.450
I found out that I had a tomb in my chest and I would have to have a very serious operation.

00:12:14.559 --> 00:12:21.440
I lost my mom to the coronavirus. Living 3,000 miles apart, there would be a long time before I would

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:29.950
be able to go home at all and I wasn't able to be there when it happened. Earlier this year,

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:34.830
my son Nathan died in a tragic accident. He was two years old.

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:40.990
At that time, I asked Jehovah the question, why is this happening to me?

00:12:43.649 --> 00:12:50.049
There was friends there before we got there. Before we got to the place we knew we were going

00:12:50.049 --> 00:12:57.649
to evacuate because they asked where it going to be. Willing just provide anything that we needed

00:12:57.649 --> 00:13:06.129
before we even knew what it was that we needed and especially spiritually. Even when I didn't know,

00:13:06.129 --> 00:13:14.460
we need to say a prayer. It was there. In those moments, we saw Jehovah's Hand.

00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:23.970
Brothers would come by and give us food. There was even a brother that called me when things started

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:34.879
to go bad and said, I think you're going to need some money. And without saying anything, he came

00:13:34.879 --> 00:13:41.789
and left an envelope outside our apartment. When we opened the envelope, we saw that there was

00:13:41.789 --> 00:13:46.590
exactly the amount we needed to pay the bills and to buy things that we needed for the apartment.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:56.399
I have only learned about brotherly love, but during that time, I really understood what it truly

00:13:56.399 --> 00:14:04.639
means. During that time, brothers who we did not even know called us. They spent time with us.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:12.879
They prayed with us. They spent a lot of their time encouraging us. During that time,

00:14:12.879 --> 00:14:19.519
I saw evidence of Jehovah's Hand in our lives. I was really, really struggling one day and I had

00:14:19.519 --> 00:14:26.399
to chat to Jehovah in prayer. I was trying to throw all my burdens on him and not two minutes after

00:14:26.399 --> 00:14:31.919
I finished that prayer, is when an elder reached out to me and gave me the best shepherd in call.

00:14:31.919 --> 00:14:38.879
I think I've ever had in my life. And clearly, that was Jehovah reaching out to me and trying to

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:44.639
show me that he understood how I felt and was there for me. After intensive care, I felt that I

00:14:44.639 --> 00:14:50.799
needed someone to hold my hand. So I understood that Jehovah would take me by the hand.

00:14:50.799 --> 00:14:58.639
A sister visited me every day. Help me get dressed. She brushed my hair and we went for short walks

00:14:58.639 --> 00:15:05.200
along the corridor. Now I can really see how compassionate and considerate Jehovah's that he

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:11.919
knows how to support us. He knows us inside and out. While we were going through this difficult time,

00:15:11.919 --> 00:15:17.519
Jehovah helped us so much and we definitely saw his hand in our lives. And in the future,

00:15:17.519 --> 00:15:22.960
if any difficulty should occur, we are confident that Jehovah will help us and protect us.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.120
It doesn't matter what we face, it'll get worse and worse in this system. But we know that

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:33.840
Jehovah can get us through absolutely anything. I've seen the overwhelming evidence in my own life.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:39.440
I've seen it for others too. And whatever Satan throws at us, it doesn't matter because

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:47.009
Jehovah is stronger. He's the most powerful ally that we can have. At this annual meeting,

00:15:47.809 --> 00:15:53.009
we have heard so much about what the governing body under the direction of Jehovah God and Christ

00:15:53.009 --> 00:16:00.289
Jesus are doing to strengthen Jehovah's people worldwide. But brothers and sisters,

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:06.690
do you know one thing that is strengthening the governing body to continue on in our work?

00:16:07.809 --> 00:16:13.490
It's you. It's every one of you brothers and sisters out in the field.

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:20.289
We know what you're going through. We read your cards and letters. We hear your expressions.

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:28.929
We know you're suffering through a difficult time. And yet you keep going. You keep enduring.

00:16:28.929 --> 00:16:37.090
You keep serving Jehovah faithfully. That not only warms our hearts, but it strengthens our own

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:45.549
faith to continue serving Jehovah. We are facing a challenging time now. And as we face the great

00:16:45.549 --> 00:16:53.389
tribulation, we will face even greater challenges. We may have times of discouragement,

00:16:53.389 --> 00:17:01.470
just like Gideon had, just like Habakkuk had, just as Elijah had. But we will also prove faithful

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:10.190
to the end, just as each of those men did if we do what? If we keep looking for Jehovah,

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:18.829
if we keep searching for his hand, if we keep turning up our spiritual hearing aids so that we can

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:25.950
be attentive to the ways that Jehovah will use to help us and to strengthen us and direct us.

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:33.230
Yes, dear brothers and sisters, keep on asking, where is Jehovah?
