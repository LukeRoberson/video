00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.570
I've launched into pioneering all, you know, looking at things through rose-tinted glasses,

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.929
I thought, right, I'm going to start pioneering, my life is going to be perfect after this.

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:25.690
And I'd never been in particularly good personal study or student when it came to, I did

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.010
the watchtower and the basics.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.170
But I realised that after a while I just wasn't finding, finding the joy, I was running

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.890
out of steam, it was my personal study that was missing, it was a big hole where I was

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.450
giving to people and not taking anything in, I needed to take in some fuel so that I

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.890
would be able to give.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:51.490
What helped me know what real service is about was getting better Bible reading routine

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:57.719
and a closer relationship with Jehovah.

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.840
You're giving out all the time on the ministry.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.840
If you're not taking in spiritual food to replenish that supply, then you'll enjoy

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.040
it from the ministry just dwindles and you don't have success.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.319
What used to satisfy you before as far as knowledge may not do there for you now because

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:15.280
you're growing in the truth.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.239
So you need to continually just step up the research in everything when it comes to personal

00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:21.239
study.

00:01:21.239 --> 00:01:25.680
Some people will try to rely on the joy that they'll get from the ministry, from the

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.359
results that they get, in some territories that simply won't work.

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:35.159
And so what a person in that situation has got to do is they've got to get joy that

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.239
comes from within them, they've got to put it there.

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:41.879
And that means they've got to stoke up their boilers with good quality personal study.

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:45.719
For instance, if you're doing your personal Bible reading and you look up some points,

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:48.239
you get really excited about it and you want to share that, you want to use that on the

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:49.239
ministry.

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:53.280
I've come to find out that if I don't sit down and actually meditate and read on what

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.000
Jehovah says, I can't balance the other things.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.760
They all start to fall out my hand.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.120
Like Bible reading and personal study is one of the smaller things that I constantly try

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.200
to work on and then I can handle the more greater things.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.680
With me, it's the insight books.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.240
I've been starting to read them and I just find it fascinating learning about all the

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.439
different Bible characters.

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:17.800
Well, I personally like the older volumes of the watchtower and wake.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.599
I mean, if you look into them, you see how many experiences are in the watchtowers.

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:22.599
It's amazing.

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.919
I often hear Victor's work on my way to work.

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:31.800
I often listen to the tapes of the magazines and then I try to read them at home and in

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.759
the evenings, depending on how tired I am, how exhausted I am, I try to read a portion

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:37.759
of the Bible.

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:46.719
I have noticed that when I do a personal study, my relationship with Jehovah gets closer,

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:53.199
my appreciation grows and in turn, I have created joy in bringing his word to the people.
