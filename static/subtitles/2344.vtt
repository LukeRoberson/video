00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Jesus teaching reached the heart.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Luke 2432 records the reaction of some of his disciples following a teaching session,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
or not our hearts burning within us as he was speaking to us on the road

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
as he was fully opening up the scriptures to us.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
When we teach, how can we reach the heart?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We can, one, use rhetorical questions to help our listeners think,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
two, urge listeners to examine why they perform good works,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and three, highlight how Bible principles and commands reflect God's qualities and is love for us.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
In the following example, does the speaker help the audience to make a self-examination?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
What's one thing you must do to gain everlasting life?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
At Matthew 1921, Jesus said to a rich young ruler,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:15.000
go sell your belongings and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven, and come be my follower.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Clearly, you must cut out of your life anything that interferes with your worship of Jehovah.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Were the words accurate?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Yes, were you moved from the heart? Probably not.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Although the speaker told us what we needed to do, he didn't help us to examine our own feelings on the matter.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Let's watch him try again.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
What's one thing we must do to gain everlasting life?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000
At Matthew 1921, we find Jesus' response to this question as posed by a rich young ruler.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Go sell your belongings and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven, and come be my follower.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Although this man had kept the commandments of the mosaic law since his youth, Jesus detected that something was missing.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Each of us does well to ask himself, what might Jesus detect about me?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Although Jehovah doesn't expect me to part with all of my belongings, is there anything in my life that interferes with my worship?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Does my job prevent me from attending congregation meetings?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Do I catch myself thinking about material things when I'm engaged in sacred service?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Material things may be valuable, but are they worth more than my everlasting life?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Well done.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
The rhetorical questions helped us to examine ourselves.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Also, instead of using the personal pronoun you, the speaker showed respect for his audience by including himself as one who needs to apply the counsel of God's Word.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
In order to reach the heart, we must also appeal to good motives.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:12.000
In other words, we should motivate our audience to act because they love Jehovah, fellow humans, and Bible teachings.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Does the Bible teacher do that in the following demonstration?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
The question asks, what do we need to avoid?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Bad habits like smoking and abusing alcohol and drugs.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
That's right, but I noticed you're still smoking.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
So, what do you need to do?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
I know I need a quit, but it's not easy.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Well, we've been studying for over a year.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
How much more time do you need?

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
How much time do you think is left before the end comes?

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Did the teacher appeal to proper motives?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
No. Instead, he tried to pressure and shame the student.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Let's watch a better way to motivate.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
The question asks, what do we need to avoid?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Bad habits like smoking and abusing alcohol and drugs.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000
That's right. Of course, it's not always easy to give up bad habits.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
But what can be a powerful motivator?

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Well, I've got to stop smoking so I won't be destroyed at Armageddon.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Actually, there's a stronger motivation.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Why do you get up early every day to go to work?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
To provide for my family.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
I do it because I love them.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Exactly.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000
In the same way, strong love for Jehovah can help you to break habits in order to please him.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And what does he provide that can help you win the battle against smoking?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Holy Spirit? Yes.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Anytime you have the urge to smoke, you can freely call on Jehovah for his hope to resist.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Let's now consider five Bible principles that will help you further.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Not only did the teacher appeal to good motives, but he also helped the student to think about how he could please Jehovah.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.000
When we do our best to reach the heart of our listeners, we'll be appealing to the best of motives.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Love for God.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Love for Jehovah. We'll move them to draw close to him and become his friends.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.000
He will motivate them to praise him not just for a short time, but for all eternity.
