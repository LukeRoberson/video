00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:07.219
It brings us great joy to help our Bible students feed themselves spiritually, so they can

00:00:07.219 --> 00:00:14.220
continue to make spiritual progress and move ever closer to serving Jehovah.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.579
The spiritual food that they digest at their weekly Bible study or their own personal

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:21.179
research is very beneficial.

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:27.420
It fills that spiritual need, that void in them, and it's also very appetizing, much like

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.140
eating an appetizer.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.380
An appetizer is something that is served before serving the main course.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.659
It's meant to wet the appetite before eating the main course.

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:44.460
Have you invited your Bible student to enjoy the main course of spiritual food at the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.100
Kingdom Hall?

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.299
Many have, and they have seen their students advance and really become happier.

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:53.780
But some have held back.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.380
They feel that they don't want to rush their student into anything, put too much pressure

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.380
on them.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.340
But this is exactly what your student needs.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.459
And fight them as soon as possible.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:12.180
Never hold back, because you could possibly be holding them back from making progress.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.780
Think about how the meetings have helped you personally and your family, and think about

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.819
how the meetings will help your student.

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:26.420
King David knew that finding joy and true happiness only comes from drawing close to Jehovah

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.340
and worshipping him at his house.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.819
Notice what he says at Psalm 65 and verse 4.

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:41.340
He says, Happy is the one whom you choose and bring near to reside in your courtyards.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.739
We will be satisfied with the goodness of your house, your holy temple.

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:53.260
Well, no doubt your Bible student is happy with their Bible study and what they're learning

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.260
about Jehovah.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.019
They have deep gratitude.

00:01:56.019 --> 00:01:59.140
Well, what is gratitude?

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.819
Gratitude means appreciating what kindness is shown to you, but it also means showing appreciation

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:09.139
and returning kindness.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:16.539
Worshiping Jehovah is how we return kindness, show our appreciation and our gratitude.

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:23.620
And when we do this, Jehovah is happy, which makes us happy as well.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:30.620
This in the following dramatization, how Nita invites her Bible study, Jade, to attend meetings.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.620
What is this?

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.020
Yeah, assisted died in that attack.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.020
It was really sad.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.219
That's time and unexpected events.

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:44.020
Well, it's one of those cases.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.419
What about when someone survives because they're at the meeting?

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:49.419
That's...

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:51.419
I don't get it.

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:55.419
Does Jehovah protect witnesses or not?

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:56.419
Funny.

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:59.419
My meeting part tonight covers that point.

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:01.419
Why don't you come?

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:03.419
You're really pushing those meetings, aren't you?

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:09.319
What time?

00:03:09.319 --> 00:04:10.889
I couldn't believe I missed her part.

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.889
But it wasn't a total loss.

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:27.589
Nita had said, at the hall, everyone loves one another.

00:04:27.589 --> 00:04:30.589
But until I'd felt it, I had no idea.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:42.699
How did Jade feel when she attended her first meeting?

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.699
Well, she really enjoyed it.

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:49.699
And she remembered what Nita told her, that everyone at the kingdom hall loves one another.

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:55.699
And Jade had to admit, but until I felt it, I had no idea.

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:01.699
She could have read it, she could have heard about it, but until she was there and feeling the love,

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:04.699
she wanted to come back.

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:09.699
The ascending meetings go hand in hand with making spiritual progress.

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:13.699
As much as they love their home Bible study, it's like an appetizer.

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:24.699
It's one part of the spiritual feeding program that Jehovah provides at the kingdom hall that main course provided through the faithful slave.

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:31.699
So during each Bible study, it would be good to explain to your student what has affected you, what impacted you,

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:37.699
what made wise decisions, what encouraged you, share it with them, and share a point that would help them.

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:41.699
Again, wet their appetite, peak their interest.

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:48.699
And when they come to the meeting, they will see true Christian love, unfailing love, in action.

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:54.699
They will see others trying to put into action and applying what they're learning at the meetings.

00:05:54.699 --> 00:06:00.699
They will make true friends that will help support them and help them to progress spiritually.

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:05.699
Attending meetings can be a bit intimidating for some and cause some anxiety.

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:10.699
So it would be good to explain to them what they might expect when they attend.

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:18.699
And one of the best ways to do this is showing them a video entitled What Happens at a Kingdom Hall.

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:25.699
And this will really put them at ease and really help them to have less anxiety when they do finally come.

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:32.699
It would be good to also invite others to the Bible study so that when your student does finally make it to the meeting,

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:37.699
they will see many familiar faces and feel much more comfortable.

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:43.699
And let the friends at the congregation know that your student is coming to the meeting so that when they walk into the door,

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:47.699
they can come over, give them a warm welcome, make them feel comfortable.

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:53.699
This is what Mita did for Jade and it worked so well. It helped her to progress.

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:58.699
Your student is a guest in Jehovah's House. Make them feel special.

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:05.699
Make them feel comfortable by offering practical help before the meeting as well as during the meeting.

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:11.699
So well in advance, what they're appetite and what they will learn once they come to the meeting.

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:17.699
It's like showing them a menu of what they will enjoy with the main course at the meeting.

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:24.699
Offer to provide a ride to your student and have them sit with you at the meetings.

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:29.699
It would also be good to make sure that they have the publications that will be discussed at the meeting.

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:34.699
Either hard copy or have it downloaded on their device.

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:41.699
As we have discussed attending meetings and enjoying the main course of spiritual food at the Kingdom Hall,

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:45.699
will help your student in so many ways. It will make them feel happier,

00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:50.699
helps them to continue progressing so they can draw close to Jehovah.

00:07:50.699 --> 00:07:55.699
The Apostle Paul gives us some more indications on what your student can enjoy.

00:07:55.699 --> 00:08:02.699
Please, notice with me what he says at Colossians chapter 2 and verse 7.

00:08:02.699 --> 00:08:08.699
He said in verse 6 that they should keep on walking but then in verse 7 that they should be rooted

00:08:08.699 --> 00:08:13.699
and built up in him, Jesus, and being stabilized into faith.

00:08:13.699 --> 00:08:18.699
Just as you were taught and then overflowing with thanksgiving.

00:08:18.699 --> 00:08:24.699
So their appreciation, their gratitude, they will want to go to the meetings and worship Jehovah.

00:08:24.699 --> 00:08:33.700
So continue to find joy in helping your student feed themselves spiritually but also help them to appreciate attending meetings on a weekly basis.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:39.700
Make it a way of life for them so they can enjoy everlasting life.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:46.700
Brother Kenneth Cook, a member of the governing body, will now consider the next part of this symposium entitled,

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:50.700
Help your Bible students to avoid bad associations.
