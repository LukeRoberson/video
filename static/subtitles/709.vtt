WEBVTT

00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:12.039
We are back at Wednesday, June 23rd, 1943, and the principal talk of the Gilead graduation

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:19.359
was delivered by Brother Nor, who spoke on the subject, work, patience, and faith.

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:24.559
Don't write that down because that's not the theme that we're going to consider today.

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:28.719
But we have another member of the governing body, Brother Sam Heard, and he's going to

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:40.090
speak on the intriguing theme, Humbly Humble.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.090
If I should ask you, are you humble students, and you say, yes, then you're not humble.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.700
Now you look humble.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:01:04.170
It's been a good program up until now, we'll see what follows.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.370
We all know that we must be humble through and through.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.930
This is something that Jehovah requires of all his servants.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.930
Not proud to be humble, but humbly humble.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.930
That's what pleases God.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.730
So that's what we're going to talk about.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.730
But what do we mean by humble?

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.170
Well, it's loneliness of mine.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.530
Certainly, it's not pompous.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.209
Field to the Giles with self-importance.

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:42.810
Jehovah says that Proverbs 8, 13, I hate self-exaltation and pride.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.090
So we want to let that sink into our hearts.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:53.650
Pride is something that Jehovah hates, but he is pleased with those who are humble.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:00.329
Now you've increased your spiritual knowledge while attending Gilead School, but you have

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:06.730
not scratched the surface of what you will know in the future.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.449
Your understanding of many things has been sharpened in these few months that you've

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:13.250
been here.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.490
And now you are eager to tell others about what you've learned, and there's certainly

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.330
nothing wrong with that.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.770
We can say it's good, but here's a caution.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.810
Be careful.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.240
Be extremely careful.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.479
Not to become a show off.

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:47.879
Standing ahead and shoulders above your brothers and sisters in your branches or in your congregations.

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.439
Don't toot your horn.

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:59.319
Get someone else to blow your horn, and the sound will carry twice as far said will roger's.

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:09.599
Better yet, consider what Jehovah inspired to be written at Proverbs 27-2.

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:15.599
Let someone else praise you and not your own mouth.

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.680
Others and not your own lips.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:28.439
Now while it may be true that they may not know as much as you, but what they know will

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:35.120
carry them through the end of their system of things into the new world.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.400
Jehovah loves them just as much as he loves you.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:46.159
Now I heard an experience years ago about a Bible student just starting to study, knows

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:50.840
a few things, loves the truth as much as he knows.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.639
Then he comes down sick unto death, and the doctors at the hospital say you must have

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:03.159
a blood transfusion, but he knows enough, no blood for me, no blood transfusion.

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:04.800
His family is not in the truth.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.280
Take that blood, boy, no blood for me.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.400
Others try to get him to take blood, no blood for me.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.400
And so the doctor operates that's successful.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.879
Everyone's happy.

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:28.439
When his teacher and others in the congregation are invited to the hospital, he has something

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:32.399
to say, what is it?

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:37.800
After they're gathered around his bed, they're thinking that something has gone wrong.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:44.319
He's going to have to take blood, and he's willing to do it when he says, why is it

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:50.100
that we don't take blood?

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:58.100
Now he does not know that the Gentile times ended in 1914.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:04.500
He doesn't know the difference between sovereignty and all the other things that people talk

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:13.100
about today, but he knows the truth, just a little bit of the truth.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:20.100
He's not concerned with the vindication of God's name and the sovereignty, the rightfulness

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.660
of God's rule.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:27.819
He doesn't know that much, but he knows enough when his life is on the line.

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:35.620
He'd rather die than the break God's law, even he can't explain that law.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.699
Now why say all that?

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:44.300
It's not how much we know that pleases Jehovah, but how we feel about what we know and

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:50.339
how we have allowed that knowledge to increase our love for Jehovah.

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:55.220
Now I'm going to invite you to open your Bible, Bible students, Gilead students.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.300
Let's turn to Romans.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:07.019
Romans, we're going to read in the 12th chapter, we're going to read a couple verses.

00:06:07.019 --> 00:06:08.019
Where are they found?

00:06:08.019 --> 00:06:10.899
Well, verse three starts us all.

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:16.699
It says, for through the undeserved kindness given to me, I tell everyone there, among

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:22.540
you not to think more of himself than it is necessary to think, but to think so as

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:31.819
to have a sound mind, each one as God has given to him a measure of faith.

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:33.660
There it is.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:39.939
We can't get too stuck on ourselves and how much we know.

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:44.019
That's not what Jehovah wants out of us.

00:06:44.019 --> 00:06:50.990
Now look at verse 16, have the same attitude toward others as toward yourselves, do not

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:59.470
set your mind on lofty things, but be let along with the lowly things, do not become wise

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:03.350
in your own eyes.

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:09.189
That's good counsel isn't it, Gilead students, excellent counsel, but you know sometimes we

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:17.329
need a little more than a couple of verses for it to reach the heart.

00:07:17.329 --> 00:07:20.569
We need to know a few more things.

00:07:20.569 --> 00:07:28.670
Knowledge has been given to us in the great abundance of these few months that we've been

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:35.189
here at Gilead school and we've just loved it, but in first Corinthians 8 and 1, it tells

00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:38.990
us something and we want to think seriously about.

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:46.370
It says, we know we all have knowledge, now here it's coming, knowledge puffs up, but

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:50.750
love builds up, now you've got a lot of knowledge.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:57.550
So be careful that it does not puff you up so that you stand as a head and shoulders

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:02.790
higher than your brothers and sisters in the congregation.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:09.069
You hope it loves them just as much as he loves you who have this advanced knowledge now

00:08:09.069 --> 00:08:12.509
all because of your schooling.

00:08:12.509 --> 00:08:16.750
Be as humble as a little child.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:21.709
And Jesus tells us a little bit about that in Matthew chapter 18.

00:08:21.709 --> 00:08:26.290
This is what he says in verses 3 and 4, truly I say to you, unless you turn around and

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:31.790
become as young children, you will by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:39.230
Therefore, whoever humbles himself, like this young child, is the one who is the greatest

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:42.789
in the kingdom of the heavens.

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:48.629
So we say humbly be humble.

00:08:48.629 --> 00:08:56.110
Job has got the most high, the universal sovereign, the king of eternity is humble.

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:59.909
This is what King David said of him.

00:08:59.909 --> 00:09:11.509
Psalm 18, your own humility will make me great and a God's humility that makes us great too.

00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:16.470
If Jehovah were not humble, we would not be here.

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:21.389
No one of mankind would be a lot.

00:09:21.389 --> 00:09:29.509
He's humble and he has the right to expect humility out of each and every one of us.

00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:39.379
We need to help each other to be humble, not glorify a human.

00:09:39.379 --> 00:09:45.139
So we say this because sometimes some of our brothers and sisters look at us as members

00:09:45.139 --> 00:09:50.139
of the governing body as if we are already angels and all you have to do is ask our wives

00:09:50.139 --> 00:09:52.659
if we are angels.

00:09:52.659 --> 00:09:54.539
You'll get a true story.

00:09:54.539 --> 00:09:56.740
We're not.

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:59.659
Just sinners like all the rest of you.

00:09:59.659 --> 00:10:05.299
So don't elevate us above where we are and what we are.

00:10:05.299 --> 00:10:07.899
If we want to elevate anything, elevate Jehovah.

00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:15.259
Now that doesn't mean that we feel that you have wronged us in some way.

00:10:15.259 --> 00:10:16.259
No, you have it.

00:10:16.259 --> 00:10:17.940
You're just human.

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:26.580
And as humans, we're filled with sin and we get carried away, but help us to be humble

00:10:26.659 --> 00:10:32.580
to rather than elevating us.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:39.139
If Bible tells us of Jehovah, he stoops down to look on heaven and earth, Psalm 113, 6.

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:40.139
What does that mean?

00:10:40.139 --> 00:10:42.259
Well, he unbeends.

00:10:42.259 --> 00:10:48.700
He waves the privilege of rank, Jehovah does that.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:53.620
So he's teaching us to wave the privilege of rank.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.379
We're all brothers.

00:10:55.379 --> 00:10:57.659
That's all we are.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.899
We don't measure up as tall as Jesus.

00:10:59.899 --> 00:11:01.899
We just try to.

00:11:01.899 --> 00:11:07.299
We try to dog his steps as best we can.

00:11:07.299 --> 00:11:08.940
Follow the example of Jehovah.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:13.740
He allowed Abraham to question his righteousness in purpose into destroy the wicked cities of

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.539
Sodom and Gomorrah.

00:11:15.539 --> 00:11:18.539
Genesis chapter 18.

00:11:18.539 --> 00:11:23.659
So Abraham says, if there's 50 righteous men, are you still going to destroy everything?

00:11:23.659 --> 00:11:26.019
He says, no, I will not.

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:27.539
Abraham comes by 45.

00:11:27.539 --> 00:11:29.539
He says, no, I will not destroy them.

00:11:29.539 --> 00:11:31.299
40, no, I will not.

00:11:31.299 --> 00:11:36.299
30, no, 20, no, 10, no.

00:11:36.299 --> 00:11:38.139
Okay, Abraham, that's enough.

00:11:38.139 --> 00:11:41.590
Close your mouth.

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:44.230
Now I added that.

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:46.470
You know what the Bible really says?

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:52.110
It says, when Jehovah finished speaking to Abraham, he went his way.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:54.149
Still humble.

00:11:54.149 --> 00:12:01.710
On a couple of occasions, he allowed Moses to reason with him as if he was another human.

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:07.590
It took humility for him to grant Moses pleas, but he did.

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:09.190
Now what about Jesus?

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:11.070
Was he humble?

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:17.470
Well, let's take a look at Philippians chapter 2 verses 5 through 8.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.269
Can we do that?

00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:23.309
Philippians 2, 5 through 8.

00:12:23.309 --> 00:12:33.179
We understand that some of you do not have your iPad or your Bible, but that's all right.

00:12:33.179 --> 00:12:34.860
You'll have time to get it later.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:45.539
Now here in the second chapter, we're able to read, starting with verse 5, it says, keep

00:12:45.539 --> 00:12:51.340
this mental attitude in you that was in Christ Jesus, who although he was existing in God's

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:57.299
form gave no consideration to a seizure, namely that he should be equal to God.

00:12:57.299 --> 00:13:03.580
Nobody emptied himself and took a slave form and became human.

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:12.100
More than that, when he came as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to the point

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:13.100
of death.

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:17.899
Yes, death on a torture stake.

00:13:17.899 --> 00:13:27.539
So yes, Jesus was humble, and Jesus washed the feet, the dirty feet of his apostles, to

00:13:27.539 --> 00:13:30.620
show them how to be humble.

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:36.220
That was the job that a servant should have done, or a slave job.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:42.419
He lured himself in front of them, perhaps he was on his knees when he washed their feet.

00:13:42.419 --> 00:13:43.419
John 13.

00:13:43.419 --> 00:13:44.700
Now why would I say that?

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:47.419
Well, I saw a picture.

00:13:47.419 --> 00:13:57.740
I saw a picture in the office building in Warwick, beautiful picture.

00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:02.820
Jesus is washing the feet of his apostles, and where's the ant?

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:03.820
He's on his knees.

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:07.059
Now the Bible doesn't say he was on his knees, I know that up, it wasn't, didn't say that

00:14:07.059 --> 00:14:12.779
John 13 chapter, but how are you going to wash feet if you don't get down toward the

00:14:12.779 --> 00:14:14.460
feet?

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:20.059
So there he was, on his knees, teaching him a lesson.

00:14:20.059 --> 00:14:25.220
The apostle Paul said a fine example of a humility, he called himself a slave of Jesus

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:28.740
Christ, Philippians 1-1.

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:34.259
Now if he had not been humble, he would not have written these words that I'm about to

00:14:34.259 --> 00:14:36.059
read.

00:14:36.059 --> 00:14:41.860
For I know that in me, that is in my flesh there dwells nothing good, for I have the desire

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:45.700
to do what is fine, but not the ability to carry out.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:52.940
For I do not do the good that I wish, but the bad that I do not wish is what I practice,

00:14:52.940 --> 00:15:02.500
Romans 7, and he was given a supernatural vision, or visions, I should say, and revelations.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:10.340
He was used moderately by Jehovah God in Acts chapter 19, verses 11 through 16, we're

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:17.899
able to see that, says, and God kept performing extraordinary, powerful works through the

00:15:17.899 --> 00:15:26.759
hands of Paul, so that even claws and aprons that had touched his body were carried to

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:32.580
the sick, and the diseases left them, and the wicked spirits came out, but some of the

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:39.360
Jews who traveled around casting out demons also tried to do the same of the Lord, use

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:45.759
the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had practiced spirits, they would say, I solemnly

00:15:45.759 --> 00:15:50.559
charge you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.

00:15:50.559 --> 00:15:58.519
Now there were seven sons of a Jewish chief priest named Siva doing this, but in answer,

00:15:58.519 --> 00:16:05.000
the wicked spirit said to them, I know Jesus, and I'm acquainted with Paul, but who are

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.320
you?

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:13.279
Not that the man who, with the wicked spirit, leaped on them, overpowered them one after

00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:22.679
the other and prevailed against them so that they fled naked and wounded out of the house.

00:16:22.679 --> 00:16:29.919
Evidently, they were not humbly humble for Jesus to let them use his name to cast out

00:16:29.919 --> 00:16:32.320
the wicked spirits.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:39.200
Paul was inspired to write 14 of the 27 books of the Christian Greek scriptures.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:46.539
Now he did not get big-headed, but he stayed humble.

00:16:46.539 --> 00:16:48.539
He's not the only humble soul.

00:16:48.539 --> 00:16:55.860
Here's another one, Nathan H. Norr, third president of the Wastar Bible and Tracks Society.

00:16:55.860 --> 00:17:02.659
He's visited the member of the writing department in the member's office and he stated that

00:17:02.659 --> 00:17:10.099
his brother Norr stated, this, the member's office, this is where the most important as

00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:18.140
well as the most difficult work takes place, that's why I do so little of it.

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:20.480
Isn't that beautiful?

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.359
That's the humble statement.

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:23.359
You know what I say behind it?

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:26.200
I say amen to it.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:33.809
I'm on the writing committee of the governing body for some reason, unknown.

00:17:33.809 --> 00:17:40.789
I can't write not a lick, but there I am.

00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:46.589
The humility shown by brother Norr made me think back in time when a group of traveling

00:17:46.589 --> 00:17:50.109
overseers was attending school in Crownsville, Maryland.

00:17:50.109 --> 00:17:54.710
Brother Ted Jairst was one of the instructors and he got up early one morning and prepared

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:57.150
a hot breakfast for all of us.

00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:58.150
He did that.

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:06.150
I was one of the instructors, but it didn't cross my mind to do a thing like that.

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:16.700
Maybe I wasn't humbly humble, or if I was, I didn't show it.

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:24.420
I can't cook either, not, not a lick.

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:27.059
What does it take to be exalted?

00:18:27.059 --> 00:18:33.299
Let's let the Bible answer, Luke 14-11, for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled

00:18:33.299 --> 00:18:36.259
and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.

00:18:36.259 --> 00:18:37.259
What does it take?

00:18:37.259 --> 00:18:38.980
It takes humility.

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:45.299
Don't learn that others are superior to the hard way.

00:18:45.299 --> 00:18:51.420
Take a lesson from my old doll, Houndo, named Boozer.

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:56.160
Sometimes he wouldn't follow us to town.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:03.440
And one day we passed a home where usually there's a little dog that lives there, but he

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:08.960
died, and something called Boozer's nose, and so Boozer was sniffing around, sniffing

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:13.599
around, and he got over near the house, and a big Dalmatian comes charging around the

00:19:13.599 --> 00:19:17.799
side of the house, and he attacked Boozer.

00:19:17.799 --> 00:19:25.680
Boozer put up a fight, but he lost the Dalmatian one.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:30.880
Boozer tucked his tail between his legs, and he darted out of there like a streak of

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:31.880
lightning.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:38.519
Little a couple of weeks later, Boozer wanted to go to town with us again, walking.

00:19:38.519 --> 00:19:43.039
But we noticed when we got to the Dalmatian's house, the Boozer was gone.

00:19:43.039 --> 00:19:53.210
Boozer took a long trip around the house, met us downtown.

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:59.930
We're about to wrap this up.

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:04.359
He was humbly humble.

00:20:04.359 --> 00:20:08.160
He viewed the Dalmatian as superior.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:12.720
Now students, do you get to point a Boozer's example?

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.599
View others as superior.

00:20:15.599 --> 00:20:38.369
They probably are.

00:20:38.369 --> 00:20:46.890
That was a fantastic talk, and I assure you Sam is a very humble person.

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:53.559
He just can't cook.

00:20:53.559 --> 00:20:58.240
Well we have a few announcements for you.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.119
First of all, you'll be interested in the attendance.

00:21:02.119 --> 00:21:14.039
In Canada, there are 902, and here in the United States, 9,702, for a total of 10,604.

00:21:14.039 --> 00:21:21.319
Now of course, we know that with the streaming, many, many more are going to be looking

00:21:21.319 --> 00:21:27.200
in on the program later, so it's going to be a lot more than 10,000.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:35.119
Now we've had some beautiful expressions from the branches, greetings to our students.

00:21:35.119 --> 00:21:37.319
We don't have time to read all of them.

00:21:37.319 --> 00:21:40.640
They will go in the archives of the teaching committee.

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:46.079
If I can't read all of them, I don't want to read just one or two.

00:21:46.079 --> 00:21:51.079
But here are the countries that are represented that have sent beautiful expressions to us.

00:21:51.079 --> 00:22:03.160
Ebola, Argentina, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Britain, Bulgaria, Burundi, Canada, Finland,

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:15.400
France, Georgia, Ghana, Haiti, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Korea, Madagascar,

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:25.039
Mozambique, Netherlands, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Portugal, Sierra Leone, Thailand,

00:22:25.039 --> 00:22:26.559
and Ukraine.

00:22:26.559 --> 00:22:29.160
And that's just about the end of the alphabet.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:35.720
So we appreciate all of these greetings, beautiful expressions of appreciation from the

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:38.880
folks in these branches.

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:47.160
While we go back to 1943, and following the principal talk, what happened?

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.680
Here's what we read, here's the report.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:57.039
A large case containing the diplomas was opened and put on the podium table.

00:22:57.039 --> 00:23:02.440
One by one, all the students were called to come forward to receive their diplomas.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:06.400
Well, we're going to follow that pattern right now.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.920
That pattern established 75 years ago.

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:15.440
And I'm very happy to have Brother David Schaefer with me if you were present for the introductions

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.079
of the class.

00:23:17.079 --> 00:23:21.799
You know what a beautiful job David did with all the names of the students.

00:23:21.799 --> 00:23:29.799
And so, behold, the 144th class of Gilead.

00:23:29.799 --> 00:23:41.960
And first, we have Brother and Sister Abu, who will be returning to the Middle East.

Brother and Sister Menju will be returning to Britain.

Brother and Sister Michani will be returning to Albania.

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:08.819
Sister Nguyen will be returning to Asia.

00:26:08.819 --> 00:26:18.130
Sister Ninghi will be returning to Papua Nugini.

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:26.480
Brother Inkurun Ziza will be returning to Burundi.

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:35.170
Brother Wadrao Gow will be returning to Benin.

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:44.740
Brother and Sister Pietrasson will be returning to Denmark.

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:56.539
Brother and Sister Sandi will be returning to Sierra Leone.

00:26:56.539 --> 00:27:06.740
Brother and Sister Santos will be returning to Portugal.

00:27:06.779 --> 00:27:15.849
Brother Skarmato will be returning to Argentina.

00:27:15.849 --> 00:27:25.900
Brother and Sister Stepanov will be returning to Azerbaijan.

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:33.920
Brother Titu will be returning to Mozambique.

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:42.259
Brother Gushi will be returning to Georgia.

00:27:42.259 --> 00:27:49.900
Brother Voya Vodin will be returning to Asia.

00:27:49.900 --> 00:28:00.490
Brother and Sister Wembalola will be serving in Madagascar.

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:26.250
And Sister Wojcik will be returning to Poland.

00:28:26.289 --> 00:28:47.369
And here they are.

00:28:47.369 --> 00:28:51.539
Let's go back to 1943.

00:28:51.539 --> 00:28:54.779
Once all the diplomas were handed out, what happened?

00:28:54.779 --> 00:28:58.339
Well, the report tells us that a representative of the class

00:28:58.339 --> 00:29:01.700
read a statement expressing the student's appreciation

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:04.019
for the privilege of attending Gilead

00:29:04.019 --> 00:29:07.539
and assuring the governing body of their loyalty to Jehovah

00:29:07.539 --> 00:29:09.380
and his organization.

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:12.299
We're going to follow the same pattern today.

00:29:12.299 --> 00:29:16.460
And Brother Richard Chilton is going to read a class letter

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:29.420
on behalf of the class to the governing body, dear brothers.

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:32.819
Few things in life bring greater satisfaction

00:29:32.819 --> 00:29:35.579
than meaningful discussions on spiritual topics

00:29:35.579 --> 00:29:37.819
with dear friends.

00:29:37.819 --> 00:29:41.019
Over the last five months, we have enjoyed

00:29:41.019 --> 00:29:43.940
the blessing of being immersed in such discussions

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:46.339
on a daily basis.

00:29:46.339 --> 00:29:49.940
As we studied the Bible book by book,

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:53.180
the examples of faithful men and women of the past

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:57.380
came to life and touched our hearts in new ways.

00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:01.339
Reliving the modern day history of Jehovah's organization,

00:30:01.339 --> 00:30:07.059
we marveled at the faith, courage, and self-sacrifice

00:30:07.059 --> 00:30:10.420
of those who have gone before us.

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:14.259
Our skills in the ministry were refined through workshops

00:30:14.259 --> 00:30:19.180
and are desired to share in the preaching work intensified.

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:26.220
As the weeks passed, fellow students became close friends.

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:29.740
Now, as the class has come to an end,

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:33.819
tears come to our eyes as we think about parting ways.

00:30:33.819 --> 00:30:35.859
But we will treasure the memories

00:30:35.859 --> 00:30:39.019
of the stimulating interchange of encouragement

00:30:39.019 --> 00:30:42.259
with our new group of friends.

00:30:42.259 --> 00:30:46.619
And what a blessing to be guided by mature devoted instructors

00:30:46.619 --> 00:30:51.259
who combined spiritual matters with spiritual words.

00:30:51.259 --> 00:30:53.500
We are grateful for their loving support

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.940
as they nurtured our spiritual growth.

00:30:55.940 --> 00:31:01.059
And we will never forget their example of zeal for God's word.

00:31:01.059 --> 00:31:05.420
Getting to know the Bethel family has been a real delight.

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:08.339
Young people who expend themselves energetically

00:31:08.339 --> 00:31:12.099
in the service of the God they love and older ones

00:31:12.099 --> 00:31:15.579
who display the wisdom that comes with decades of experience

00:31:15.579 --> 00:31:18.220
in applying Christian principles.

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:22.420
Their kindness, friendship, and hospitality

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:25.019
have touched our hearts.

00:31:25.019 --> 00:31:28.059
Sometimes we think we know our friends well,

00:31:28.059 --> 00:31:30.500
but our appreciation for them is enhanced

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:35.259
as we find out more about good deeds they have done in the past.

00:31:35.259 --> 00:31:40.299
This has been the case in our relationship with our God.

00:31:40.299 --> 00:31:44.380
Jehovah constantly surprises and delights us.

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:49.940
As we reflect on all that He is and all that He has done,

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:54.779
we feel moved to praise His beautiful name.

00:31:54.779 --> 00:31:59.460
While this school has far exceeded our expectations,

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:03.180
it has also left us longing for more.

00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:05.619
We are resolved to continue our program

00:32:05.619 --> 00:32:08.619
of meaningful personal study.

00:32:08.619 --> 00:32:12.980
As Moses said in Deuteronomy chapter 30 verse 11,

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:17.700
this commandment is not beyond your reach.

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:23.299
It is not in the heavens, nor on the other side of the sea.

00:32:23.299 --> 00:32:26.500
In any situation, we know we will always

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:29.220
find an illuminating scriptural principle

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:32.539
and encouraging thought or an informative article

00:32:32.539 --> 00:32:35.579
to help us to do what is right.

00:32:35.579 --> 00:32:38.339
Our Gilead course may be over, but we

00:32:38.339 --> 00:32:41.059
are left with an even greater appreciation

00:32:41.059 --> 00:32:44.539
for the wealth of spiritual food in our publications,

00:32:44.539 --> 00:32:47.700
which remains to be explored.

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:52.980
We would not exchange the past five months for anything.

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:55.099
We sincerely thank the governing body

00:32:55.099 --> 00:32:58.900
for arranging for us to benefit from this magnificent spiritual

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:00.460
education.

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:03.579
And we assure you that we will do all we

00:33:03.579 --> 00:33:07.539
can to use these treasures to build up others.

00:33:07.579 --> 00:33:40.250
Your brothers and sisters, the 144th class of Gilead.

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:44.089
Well, what more can we add?

00:33:44.089 --> 00:33:47.009
All we can say is that we love you,

00:33:47.009 --> 00:33:50.170
and we pray Jehovah's rich blessing upon you,

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:53.930
and may this school of Gilead continue

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:58.769
to serve as a symbol of the peace and unity

00:33:58.769 --> 00:34:01.130
of Jehovah's organization.
