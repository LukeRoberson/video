A lot of people say that no intelligent person would believe in God.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
But that's just not true.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:30.260
Many professionals believe in God, including doctors, lawyers, teachers, even many scientists.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.259
When I see a car, I ask myself, who built that?

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:39.259
It takes intelligent people to design a car.

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:45.259
I mean, so many things have to work just right for the whole thing to run smoothly.

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:56.200
And if a car needed someone to design it, so did humans, and so did the earth, and so did the universe.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.200
It's like you're walking on a beach.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.200
You see an empty glass bottle sticking out of the sand.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.200
Now, glass, it's made out of sand particles.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.200
But honestly, would intelligent person believe that the bottle assembled itself from sand particles?

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.200
No, of course not.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.200
Researchers are exploring design features of insects, fish, and other animals to create new products.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.200
Or, improved products that already exist.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.200
There's a bird called the kingfisher.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.200
Its beak is shaped so that it can dive quickly from air into water without using too much speed.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:38.459
So engineers have used the shape of this bird's beak to design the nose of Japan's bullet train.

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:43.459
As a result, it goes 10% faster while using 15% less energy.

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:49.459
Some airplanes navigate with the help of a computerized autopilot system that could fit in your hand.

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:52.459
But that's nothing.

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:56.459
The Monarch butterfly has a brain the size of the pinhead.

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:01.459
And yet, it's able to navigate from Canada all the way to Mexico.

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:03.459
That's about 1800 miles.

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:06.459
That's amazing.

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:10.460
Humans get credit for the designs they've copied from nature.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.460
So who should get credit for the original?

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.460
No matter where we look in the natural world.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.460
At birds, butterflies, fish.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.129
Everything gives evidence of a creator.

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.129
Want more information?

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:29.129
Go to JW.org.

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.129
Look for the publications tab.

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.129
And download the brochure was Life Create.
