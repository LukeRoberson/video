WEBVTT

00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:11.380
We warmly welcome you dear brothers and sisters for our first JW Broadcasting

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:17.660
monthly program. Here are some of the highlights you can look forward to. You will

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:26.019
hear the exciting story of a brother who found the truth at the age of 87. We also

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:31.859
have an archive interview with brother Theodore Jarrah's about how we can

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.219
overcome opposition. And you will see a music video about wildlife as a

00:00:38.219 --> 00:01:05.680
Christian is the best life ever. The governing body has approved this station on

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:12.319
a trial basis initially in the English language only based on the response

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:18.200
from viewers. And your support of this new arrangement it is hoped that other

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.920
languages will enjoy the same in the future. In addition to having our videos

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:32.879
available on demand, JW Broadcasting will feature an encouraging monthly

00:01:32.879 --> 00:01:39.040
program hosted by member of the governing body. This month on behalf of the

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.319
governing body I would like to address the young ones in our congregations. But

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:51.040
before we do so, we thought you would like to see the behind the scenes work that

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:57.519
went into creating this beautiful studio. Please watch this short explanatory

00:01:57.519 --> 00:02:09.729
video. It is evident that JW Broadcasting has Jehovah's Blessing. Those involved

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:20.050
in preparing the studio, the equipment, and the content all said that they could

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.810
feel Jehovah's Hand directing every step, every decision, every day. Upon

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.169
learning of its intended purpose, many long days went into planning its

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:36.250
design and what it would take to construct it and have it ready as soon as possible.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.770
Research that usually takes months was completed in days. The purchasing

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.530
department ordered hundreds of items in record time starting of course with the

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.969
items that required the most lead time. In the meantime, a scout team got busy

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:58.289
searching for a suitable location and a good one was found in the office

00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:03.689
complex at 30 Columbia Heights. Sensing Jehovah's direction on this endeavor,

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:13.810
the brothers vacated the entire area in just one week. The maintenance departments

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:22.539
then prepared the room for television production while the design team

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:28.500
diligently worked on the look of the set. Color and lighting were key pieces in

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.180
conveying a dignified, yet modern feel. The approved design was then

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:42.460
translated into an actual set by the construction crew. Many brothers and

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:59.479
sisters from around the U.S. were called into assist. After only a few days, the

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:16.589
equipment started to arrive. Miles of cables were installed and the technical

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:21.029
team had to ensure that all of the pieces of hardware and software worked well

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:31.649
together. Simultaneously, the orchestra was recording the theme music in our

00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:46.410
audio video studios at Patterson. Brothers and sisters from all over the world

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.410
contributed with their skills. But a television studio is no good without

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:57.810
content. Video productions were immediately started by the film crews, scripts

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:30.379
had to be prepared, and reenactment scheduled. When the set was finished, the

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:35.500
equipment installed, and the videos completed, the team started rehearsing the

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:57.410
program that you are now watching. We asked an industry professional how long it

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:02.769
would normally take to complete a studio and project of this size. He said

00:06:02.769 --> 00:06:09.699
without hesitating, at least a year and a half. Yet our hardworking brothers and

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:17.899
sisters accomplished this monumental task in just two months. This just emphasizes

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:23.259
the fact that when Jehovah wants something done, there is nothing that can

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:30.300
stop him. Some of the materials and all of the work on this studio were

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:36.339
donated, which we very much appreciate. Still, as you can see, there was a

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:41.819
significant outlay of funds to complete the project. Some of you may be

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:47.019
wondering why we would embark on a project like this here in Brooklyn,

00:06:47.019 --> 00:06:53.379
knowing full well that in a little over two years, Jehovah willing, we will be

00:06:53.379 --> 00:07:00.220
moving World Headquarters to Warwick, New York. Number one, we wanted you

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:05.740
brothers and sisters to benefit from this initiative as soon as possible. And

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:12.060
two, everything acquired and purchased for this studio will be transferred to

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:19.660
the Warwick area except the pain on the walls and the pain on the floor. So

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:25.540
really, it is an investment that we're hopeful with your support can be used on

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:35.560
into the years ahead. I want to address the theme, young ones, you are loved by

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:42.959
Jehovah and his organization. Young ones, you are loved by Jehovah and his

00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:51.519
organization. But now, when we say young ones, to whom are we referring? As

00:07:51.519 --> 00:07:57.040
evidence of Jehovah's love, some may immediately think of the animated series

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:03.240
of videos entitled Become Jehovah's Friend Feaching Featuring, Caleb and

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:09.480
Sophia. And that has indeed been evidence of Jehovah's and the governing

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:15.399
body's love for little children. We have gotten hundreds of letters of

00:08:15.399 --> 00:08:21.560
appreciation for this series from small children and their parents and even

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:28.519
from grandparents. But what about you teenagers? You two are still young when

00:08:28.519 --> 00:08:34.559
compared to adulthood and you are appreciated very much when you show your

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:40.240
respect and love for Jehovah. There's a Bible indicate anything about Jesus

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:49.200
disposition as a teenager. There are comments about him as an infant. Also in the

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:55.080
book of Luke, it describes Jesus as a child of 12 years old. Let's look at that

00:08:55.080 --> 00:09:01.360
account and determine if it also includes any comments about Jesus'

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:12.000
attitude as a teenager. In Luke chapter 2, verse 42, it describes Jesus as a

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:23.960
pre-teen in saying this, Luke 2 42, and when he was 12 years old, they went up

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:28.919
according to the custom of the festival. When the days of the festival were

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:37.240
over and they were returning, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem and his

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:45.440
parents did not notice it. So his parents went looking for him and finally found

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:53.480
him three days later. What was Jesus focused on as a 12-year-old? He was sitting

00:09:53.480 --> 00:10:00.600
in the temple talking with the teachers about Jehovah. Notice verse 47, but all

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:08.000
those listening to him were in constant amazement at his understanding and his

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:15.399
answers. What a good example for you children 12 years of age and younger to

00:10:15.399 --> 00:10:23.000
talk about Jehovah with confidence. But what was Jesus' attitude like as a

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:33.720
teenager? Please follow along in verses 51 and 52. Then he, Jesus, went down with

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:42.279
them and returned to Nazareth and he continued subject to them. That is to his

00:10:42.279 --> 00:10:55.799
parents. How old was he? 12, but what comes after 12? 13. Notice verse 52, and Jesus

00:10:55.799 --> 00:11:04.600
went on progressing. You see after 12, he went on progressing in wisdom and in

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:13.539
physical growth and in favor with God and man. Evidently then, Jesus was in

00:11:13.539 --> 00:11:21.100
intelligent well-balanced teenager. But who took note of his progress as a

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:29.899
teen? It said God and man. Yes, godly children and teenagers are appreciated by

00:11:29.899 --> 00:11:36.460
Jehovah and by spiritual men. Jehovah in his organization love all you young

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:43.860
ones who are striving to do what is right. But how do we know that Jehovah loves

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:52.379
all of you? Well, if you have your Bible, turn to Matthew chapter 19 and here we

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:59.980
say that Jesus showed his high regard for young ones. So Matthew chapter 19,

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:08.720
notice verses 13 and 14. Then young children were brought to him, for him to

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:17.179
place his hands on them and offer prayer. But the disciples reprimanded them. They

00:12:17.179 --> 00:12:24.700
did not want the young ones to bother Jesus. But notice verse 14, Jesus, however,

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:33.700
said, let the young children alone. And do not try to stop them from coming to me for

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:42.580
the kingdom of the heavens belongs to such ones. Yes, Jesus welcomed young ones. And

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:48.779
the Bible tells us that Jesus is the perfect reflection of Jehovah. So Jesus was

00:12:48.779 --> 00:12:55.279
imitating Jehovah's love for young ones. After many wise sayings and performing

00:12:55.279 --> 00:13:02.320
miracles, Matthew chapter 21 describes Jesus riding into Jerusalem as Jehovah's

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:07.559
anointed one. Please notice the difference between some of the adults reactions

00:13:07.559 --> 00:13:17.679
and that of appreciative young ones. Matthew 21 and verse 15 tells us this, when

00:13:17.679 --> 00:13:24.620
the chief priest and the scribe saw the marvelous things he did and the boys

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:30.919
who were shouting in the temple, save we pray the son of David, they became

00:13:30.919 --> 00:13:39.159
indignant. Who was boldly praising Jesus? The scripture said that the boys were

00:13:39.159 --> 00:13:45.299
shouting out praise. What a contrast those young ones were to the religious

00:13:45.299 --> 00:13:51.659
leaders who were irritated by all of this. Young people, when you speak up

00:13:51.659 --> 00:13:57.980
about Jehovah and Jesus, they both take notice of you. They are proud of your

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:04.059
stand for the truth. But how do you know that the governing body and the

00:14:04.059 --> 00:14:09.580
organization loves you? Well, they have published many books and magazine

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:15.299
articles specifically for young ones. In addition to all of the printed

00:14:15.299 --> 00:14:22.220
material, there are the Becomes Jehovah's Friend videos for children. But

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:27.659
you teenagers, have you been keeping up with all of the information specifically

00:14:27.659 --> 00:14:35.779
for you on JW.org? There are dozens of printed articles on an array of

00:14:35.779 --> 00:14:42.740
subjects that interest those of your age. In so many ways, Jehovah and his

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:52.860
organization show their love and appreciation for all you dear young ones. What

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:58.980
can you young ones do in return? You may say, I go to all the meetings and out in

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:05.820
service. Well, that is wonderful. Some of you may have even joined the

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:10.779
Theocratic ministry school already, and you help clean and maintain the kingdom

00:15:10.779 --> 00:15:19.139
hall. We warmly commend you for your good works. But if you think about it, even

00:15:19.139 --> 00:15:25.100
more important, is having a good personal relationship with Jehovah. In Luke

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:33.860
chapter 10, verse 27, it says, you must love Jehovah your God with your whole

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:40.299
heart and with your whole soul and with your whole strength and with your whole

00:15:40.299 --> 00:15:48.019
mind. To love Jehovah with your whole heart means that you have a good personal

00:15:48.019 --> 00:15:54.379
relationship with him. That involves more than just doing good things. It involves

00:15:54.379 --> 00:16:02.059
praying to him about what is in your heart. Tell him everything you love and

00:16:02.419 --> 00:16:10.379
whatever you fear. You can tell Jehovah very personal things. He is not going to

00:16:10.379 --> 00:16:17.179
tell anyone else. But he can give you the strength and wisdom to handle matters

00:16:17.179 --> 00:16:23.100
for the best possible outcome. Set up your own personal Bible study program in

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:29.659
addition to family worship evening. This is how Jehovah communicates back to you and

00:16:30.299 --> 00:16:36.860
your relationship with him will be strengthened. You are the next generation of

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:43.259
adults in Jehovah's organization. We continue to need spiritually qualified

00:16:43.259 --> 00:16:49.740
ones to get Jehovah's work done. A good relationship with Jehovah's

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:58.779
youth sets you up for the best way of life as a responsible adult. Along the way

00:16:58.779 --> 00:17:06.660
though, you will face pressure from Satan's system that can test your faith. But by

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:13.019
loving Jehovah with your whole heart, you can get through any test you may

00:17:13.019 --> 00:17:23.119
encounter. And I mean any test that you may encounter. Some tests come from your

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:33.759
schoolmates. For example, due to a lack of proper training, some resort to

00:17:33.759 --> 00:17:40.799
becoming a bully in school. These ones seem to enjoy making life miserable for

00:17:40.799 --> 00:17:47.799
others. Watch the following video and see how faithful one from the past can

00:17:47.799 --> 00:18:04.789
give us the strength to endure such mistreatment. If I had known what was going to

00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:14.420
happen that day, I probably would have stayed in bed. My name is Ethan. I'm 14 years

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:36.920
old. And like any teenager, the first day of school can be a little scary. In

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:53.900
junior high, there's always someone who wants to cause trouble. So there I was. The

00:18:53.900 --> 00:19:02.900
first day in my new class, all I wanted to do was make a good first impression and

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:50.640
stay out of trouble. But it came looking for me. My life in junior high was now over.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:20:40.519
I started to imagine what the rest of the year might be like. It wasn't a pretty

00:20:40.519 --> 00:20:50.809
picture. Things got better when I talked to dad. I told him everything that

00:20:50.809 --> 00:20:55.690
happened that day. He listened to me, told me we would face it together and make it

00:20:55.690 --> 00:21:00.930
the subject of our next family worship. Dad said, we're going to talk about a

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:16.059
real challenge David faced and what helped him. David had enemies that were

00:21:16.059 --> 00:21:21.500
determined to hurt him. Instead of taking matters into his own hands, he trusted

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:29.819
in Jehovah. He wasn't weak. In fact, many celebrated his victories. And this

00:21:29.819 --> 00:21:47.339
made King Saul very jealous. His friends wanted him to fight Saul. But instead,

00:21:47.339 --> 00:21:59.220
he relied on Jehovah. Saul's son Jonathan was a true friend. He warned David when

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:13.880
he was in danger. I learned a lot from that Bible account. Don't take matters in

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:24.519
my own hands. Avoid the bully when possible. Be a real friend to those in trouble. Talk

00:22:24.519 --> 00:22:32.849
to someone that can help. Like parents, a teacher, or a responsible adult. And most

00:22:32.849 --> 00:22:41.589
importantly, pray to Jehovah and rely on him. That weekend, we went out in service as

00:22:41.589 --> 00:22:58.420
a family. You wouldn't believe who came to the door. It was the bully. I quickly said

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:09.789
prayer. I started with my presentation. I even showed him a video. You know, my

00:23:09.789 --> 00:23:18.740
parents used the Bible to give me the confidence I needed to deal with a bully.

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:26.740
As indicated, there are some practical steps to try to avoid such bullying. However,

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:31.819
did you notice the strength and confidence we can gain from Bible characters of

00:23:31.819 --> 00:23:40.779
the past? Our relationship with Jehovah truly can make a difference. But now, we have

00:23:40.779 --> 00:23:47.380
a special treat to share with you. From our video archives, we have comments from

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:53.259
Brother Theodore Jaros, who served as a member of the governing body before he died and

00:23:53.259 --> 00:23:59.539
received his heavenly reward. Young ones, this illustrates that weathering

00:23:59.539 --> 00:24:07.220
tests of faith as a young person can mold us for a long life of faithful service.

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:16.059
Brother Jaros recounts what he had to face as a young man.

00:24:16.059 --> 00:24:22.819
During World War II, time was pioneering. When we go back to that period of time, it was

00:24:22.819 --> 00:24:29.900
a different era. Many times individuals would even threaten you. They were going to run

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:38.740
you out of the community or out of the neighborhood and sometimes even resort to other threats.

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:45.619
And I have some vivid recollections of what it was like. I was a young man at the time.

00:24:45.619 --> 00:24:50.740
It was a joy to be out in the ministry, but you had to be very equipped to be ready to

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:56.460
give an answer if the hope that it was as in you and to uphold the position that a Christian

00:24:56.460 --> 00:25:04.059
should take in such turbulent times. The organization published a very fine article

00:25:04.059 --> 00:25:11.059
that was very timely on the subject of neutrality. That appeared in the November 1, 1939 issue

00:25:11.059 --> 00:25:18.299
of the watchtower. It defined what neutrality meant. When it comes to being in support of

00:25:18.299 --> 00:25:24.259
some cause, we were 100% in support of the kingdom. We were representing God's kingdom

00:25:24.259 --> 00:25:30.220
as God's ambassadors or envoys here upon the earth. And so we could not engage in any

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:37.220
of the world's controversies or share in their war efforts because we were not taking sides.

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:47.019
The convention in St. Louis was held during the period of the war. The convention program

00:25:47.019 --> 00:25:54.339
pressed upon my mind the need for keeping integrity. And in doing that, we would be upholding

00:25:54.339 --> 00:26:00.859
Jehovah's sovereignty. When it came time for recruiting young men, and we had to register

00:26:00.859 --> 00:26:07.740
for the draft, why the brothers already knew what their position would be. But since

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:13.500
the World War II was raging, here in this country, especially, there was a lot of patriotic

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:19.660
fervor. And the attitude of people was that if you weren't in the army as a young man,

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:28.140
and you were either considered to be unfit or else you were a draft dodger. And so when

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:35.859
we went out in the field ministry, many times people would abuse you verbally, especially

00:26:35.859 --> 00:26:42.059
if they were opposed. There was some provision in the United States Selective Service Act

00:26:42.059 --> 00:26:49.220
that allowed for ministers to be exempted. But for the most part, only pioneers and some

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:56.380
who may have had appointed positions in the congregation were given recognition as ministers.

00:26:56.380 --> 00:27:01.900
That was rare. But most of the brothers had to go to prison. And they were prepared

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:10.380
for this. They knew what was in store. And they made a firm stand for Jehovah's Righteous

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:17.180
Cause. And I enjoyed preaching. But I was prepared to do like many of the other brothers were ready

00:27:17.819 --> 00:27:22.539
to do. And that was to go to prison if we had to and suffer for righteousness sake.

00:27:23.339 --> 00:27:30.539
This is a group we were unpopular. And there was a lot of publicity given to mob violence or

00:27:30.539 --> 00:27:37.339
beatings or perhaps other things that people were not in agreement with as far as Jehovah's

00:27:37.339 --> 00:27:42.779
Witnesses are concerned. On the other hand, there were many honest hearted people who really

00:27:42.779 --> 00:27:47.980
listened to the Kingdom message. We found a lot of sheep like ones and they were sympathetic

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:54.140
to us. They had a love for the Bible. We had many home Bible studies that were being conducted

00:27:54.140 --> 00:28:00.059
at that time. Though we will always refer to the precedent that we have in the position that

00:28:00.059 --> 00:28:08.380
Jesus Christ took when he was before pilot and Roman official. And as Jesus pointed out, his

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:14.059
kingdom was no part of this world. And since we represent God's kingdom, we're sort of aliens

00:28:14.059 --> 00:28:19.819
in this world representing that government. And so as a result, that's where our allegiance

00:28:19.819 --> 00:28:25.500
belongs. So that does not mean that we're seditionist, that we're opposed to human governments.

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:32.299
It simply means that we're neutral. This helped to strengthen the brothers. Because when they

00:28:32.299 --> 00:28:38.859
saw others holding fast to the truth and maintaining their integrity, and that was a challenge in

00:28:38.859 --> 00:28:46.700
those turbulent days, that to steal them for opposition that they had to face. So rather than

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:53.579
frightening our brothers, as the Apostle Paul pointed out, we should not be frightened by our

00:28:53.579 --> 00:28:58.940
opponents. Our brothers were really filled with a greater measure of Jehovah's spirit which enabled

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:08.210
them to be bold and also to be fearless in declaring the truth. With we take our stand firmly on

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:18.210
Jehovah's side and support that side, then we're going to succeed in accomplishing what he wants us

00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:24.609
to do. He's backing us up. And as Jesus promised, he would be with us down to the conclusion of the

00:29:24.609 --> 00:29:31.490
system of things we experienced that. As the Prophet's Echariah wrote, it's not by human might

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:39.410
or power, but by my spirit. It would be impossible for humans to do what Jehovah accomplished.

00:29:40.049 --> 00:29:47.250
We have to get him full credit for things that have transpired. And it's a marvel in our eyes when

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:53.890
we look back to see how he did it. We were simply instruments in his hand. And he maneuvered us,

00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:59.650
he guided us by his spirit, and we tried to be responsive to the way that spirit led us.

00:30:02.339 --> 00:30:09.779
What a fine record of faithfulness brother Jarrah's built up from his youth and from decades

00:30:09.779 --> 00:30:19.059
thereafter. Although his experience dated back to World War II, today over 600 witnesses worldwide

00:30:19.059 --> 00:30:27.299
are imprisoned for remaining neutral in world affairs. Join us as we visit the legal department

00:30:27.299 --> 00:30:34.819
at World Headquarters. They work tirelessly to help our brothers legally and to protect our rights

00:30:34.819 --> 00:30:46.109
to publicly witness to others. Please watch. In carrying out the responsibility to do God's will,

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:52.750
it's true. One on one at the same time. Jehovah's witnesses have met with legal challenges.

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:57.789
All right, children, let's stand for the pledge of allegiance. These challenges have been many

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:06.369
and at times severe. There's no time to lose. We need to get on a surgery right away,

00:31:06.369 --> 00:31:11.170
and we need to prepare for blood transfer. This has led to the establishment of a legal department,

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:15.569
which is located at the Watchtower Educational Center in Patterson, New York.

00:31:16.529 --> 00:31:20.930
Under the direction of the governing body and the United States Branch Committee,

00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:27.009
the legal department works to protect our legal rights to worship. When restrictions are placed

00:31:27.009 --> 00:31:35.730
on our activities, we work to defend and legally establish the good news. Let's examine a case

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:43.089
that was taken all the way to the United States Supreme Court. The town of Stratton, Ohio passed

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:48.849
an ordinance requiring anyone wanting to engage in door-to-door activity to obtain a permit from

00:31:48.849 --> 00:31:56.130
the mayor. The ordinances that were enacted were specifically designed to restrict the activity

00:31:56.130 --> 00:32:01.730
of Jehovah's witnesses. The witnesses tried to work the matter out with the municipality with the

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:07.089
village, but the village was insistent. Our brothers and sisters obtained permits prior to

00:32:07.089 --> 00:32:12.369
going from door-to-door. This permit scheme was upheld in the lower courts in Ohio.

00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:22.019
Thus, the case was appealed to the United States Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ruled in our

00:32:22.019 --> 00:32:29.460
favor and held that such ordinances are unconstitutional as applied to the public ministry of Jehovah's

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:35.059
witnesses. Even now, we still have some municipalities that would like to enforce their

00:32:35.059 --> 00:32:39.619
permit regulation against our brothers and sisters. We turn their attention to the Stratton

00:32:39.619 --> 00:32:48.259
decision and the issue is resolved. Since 1919, Jehovah's witnesses have obtained 50 victories

00:32:48.259 --> 00:32:56.819
before the United States Supreme Court. Just as extraordinary, we have prevailed in the European

00:32:56.819 --> 00:33:05.140
Court of Human Rights over 50 times. Jehovah's witnesses do not seek confrontation. They prefer to

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:16.019
quietly serve God, but when events unfold that force them to stand up and say, I won't do this,

00:33:16.019 --> 00:33:24.900
or I have to do that, because my faith compels me to do so. It is remarkable to see the

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:30.980
steel-like determination of these individuals who have looked in the eyes of judges,

00:33:31.539 --> 00:33:36.819
magistrates, police officers, and have simply said, I have to obey God.

00:33:38.259 --> 00:33:42.420
What part can you play in defending and legally establishing the good news?

00:33:43.779 --> 00:33:48.900
You can stay informed of legal developments by means of reports provided by the faithful and

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:55.380
discreet slave. You can ask Jehovah in prayer to give your brothers and sisters the power beyond

00:33:55.460 --> 00:34:03.839
what is normal and for his will to be done. Also, you can faithfully maintain your integrity to

00:34:03.839 --> 00:34:10.559
Jehovah even when facing opposition. And thank you again for respecting my wishes. You're very welcome.

00:34:10.559 --> 00:34:16.480
How grateful we are to Jehovah, who has granted his people the legal victories needed to freely

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:23.199
carry out our worship. I know you have your ministry, but when people call, it is the legal

00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:29.360
department's privilege to work shoulders to shoulder with you in defending and legally establishing

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:40.210
the good news. The legal department is just one of many Bethel departments around the globe

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:47.570
that support the governing body's direction to further the preaching of the good news worldwide.

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:55.010
One of the goals many young ones set early on is a possibility of coming to Bethel.

00:34:55.329 --> 00:35:02.530
Those who have served in Bethel for any length of time usually will tell you that one of the highlights

00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:11.570
is the morning worship program conducted each weekday. Periodically, we will select the pertinent

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:20.130
morning worship to share with you here on JW Broadcasting. In fact, we are pleased to share one now.

00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:27.090
These are comments that were shared recently at morning worship. Brother William Malam font

00:35:27.090 --> 00:35:31.489
was serving his chairman that morning. Please listen carefully.

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:40.050
We're in the only race that offers the prize of everlasting life to all those who cross the

00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:48.610
finish line. It's the only race of that kind. And in this race, we don't compete with one another

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:55.489
for Jehovah's favor. The spirit of competition in this world is out of control. In fact,

00:35:55.489 --> 00:36:03.650
can you imagine a professional soccer player resorting to biting a rival in a soccer match?

00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:09.489
And really, we see so much competition and so many people in the sports world

00:36:10.449 --> 00:36:16.929
who just don't follow the rules of the game. In fact, there are times when I enjoy watching

00:36:16.929 --> 00:36:21.650
some sporting events, but there are times when it just sourses me when I look at the attitude

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:29.170
of some of the players and the way they deal with one another and also the egotism and the pride

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:35.090
that's involved with them. There's another thing also that I find almost amusing except for the

00:36:35.090 --> 00:36:40.289
individual it is. And in some cases, you can identify the sport that a person may be engaging in

00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:47.090
because he's got no front teeth. Now, I won't enumerate what sports I have in mind. I'll leave

00:36:47.090 --> 00:36:56.849
that with you. But the point is, we never want to stoop to biting a rival runner in the race

00:36:56.849 --> 00:37:07.760
that we're in. It can be done. Let's take our Bible and look at Galatians chapter 5. Galatians chapter

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:17.599
5 and we'll read verses 16, 15 and 16. Here the Apostle Paul wrote to the congregation,

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:24.719
if though you keep on biting and devouring one another, look out that you do not get annihilated

00:37:24.719 --> 00:37:30.800
by one another. Well, that has to do with cutting gossip and evil remarks about other people.

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:37.280
And they would argue and fight over words and perhaps even traditions. And

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:41.440
that Paul is telling them, don't do that. And we don't deal that way with our brothers and

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:46.800
sisters. And then in verse 16 he says, but I say, keep walking and we'll insert a word,

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:54.239
they'll keep running by spirit and you will carry out no fleshly desire at all. And that's what

00:37:54.320 --> 00:38:02.000
all of us want to do. It's common in races for the faster runners to pass the slower ones.

00:38:03.679 --> 00:38:08.719
But we shouldn't be discouraged if someone in the race that we're in passes us. It might

00:38:08.719 --> 00:38:13.360
seem that he passes us or she passes us. Maybe the individual has more experience,

00:38:14.079 --> 00:38:20.159
a more ability, brighter, but it's not going to make any real difference as to the outcome of the

00:38:20.159 --> 00:38:27.840
race as long as we give Jehovah God our best. And we finish the race. And that is a key point for

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:34.960
us to keep in mind. It's the outcome of the race. A runner sometimes stumbles. You've perhaps seen

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:40.320
this in some of these track field and track races or games that they play. And usually if it's a

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:44.880
short race and he stumbles, he's out of it. He's just not going to be able to get back up and

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:51.760
win the race. He may end to finish the race, but he's not a winner. Maybe he falls down,

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:57.519
hurts himself. Well, that can happen. That can happen to us even in the race that we're in,

00:38:57.519 --> 00:39:01.760
but the key point with the race we're in, even if we fall down and we stumble, we get back up

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:07.280
and we get going. And who doesn't stumble over something at some time or another that irritates him

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:13.519
or bothers him? But we never stop running the race because all we want to do is stay in the race

00:39:14.159 --> 00:39:20.159
and finish it. And something else to keep in mind if a person happens to stumble, even fall to

00:39:20.159 --> 00:39:29.039
the ground. Don't look back at what caused it or who caused it. Keep your eyes right in front of

00:39:29.039 --> 00:39:34.639
you looking ahead at the course. Because if a person, can you imagine a runner coming around

00:39:34.639 --> 00:39:39.360
the track and then looking back constantly to see my, what was it? I tripped over. Who did that to

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:44.239
me? He's going to run into another runner. He's going to be disqualified. He won't be obeying the

00:39:44.239 --> 00:39:50.320
rules or he'll just fall down again and he'll be out of the race. So we don't want to look back and

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:57.119
worry about past things, problems or stumbling that took place. We get back up and we get going as

00:39:57.119 --> 00:40:04.559
well as we can. Well, right now we're near the end of the race. The goal is almost in sight.

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:14.500
The finish line. What does Paul tell us at Hebrews chapter 12? Hebrews chapter 12 verse 1.

00:40:18.059 --> 00:40:23.260
Paul writes, so then because we have such a great cloud of witnesses surrounding us,

00:40:24.059 --> 00:40:30.619
who is that great cloud? Well, chapter 11 gives us the names of a lot of faithful people who

00:40:30.619 --> 00:40:36.699
ran the race. They finished it. They finished it when they died faithful to Jehovah.

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:43.500
And we have this cloud of witnesses around us. We can read about their life, their experiences.

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:48.539
It's just as though they're on the sidelines in a sense having completed the race and now they're

00:40:48.539 --> 00:40:54.460
cheering us on. Finish it. Look at our problems. Look at the things we've done in spite of

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:58.940
difficulties that we've had to face. You can do it too. That's basically what they're telling us.

00:40:59.739 --> 00:41:04.539
And then he says, let us also throw off every weight and the sin that easily entangles us.

00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:10.699
Well, that's in that easily entangles us as a lack of faith, isn't it? We can drift away,

00:41:10.699 --> 00:41:16.460
become irritated over some direction, or perhaps a rule of some kind that we don't particularly

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:21.579
care for, and little by little a person can drift away. But we don't want that to happen to us.

00:41:21.579 --> 00:41:27.900
In fact, we can become very anxious about certain things. A key phrase that's good to keep in mind

00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:35.739
is reduce anxiety. Whatever we can eliminate from our life to do away with anxiety is a benefit to us.

00:41:36.539 --> 00:41:43.179
And then he goes on and he says, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us.

00:41:43.179 --> 00:41:49.179
And we do have some wonderful examples of past runners. Hannah, Ruth,

00:41:50.139 --> 00:41:59.739
Jeppe's daughter, Abigail, Moses, Joshua, Caleb, and so many more. So we want to imitate their faith.

00:41:59.739 --> 00:42:05.659
And isn't that a wonderful publication we have, imitate their faith? It's a pleasant thing to take

00:42:05.659 --> 00:42:12.300
an evening, perhaps each week, and with your mate or with your roommate, go over a chapter of it,

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:18.860
read it out loud and cover the material. It's very inspiring. And we know we can finish the race

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:26.300
we're going to do just what Jesus said. The one that has endured to the end is the one that

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:30.699
will be saved. Just stick with it and give Jehovah our best.

00:42:32.699 --> 00:42:39.420
I think you can understand why morning worship is one of the highlights of Bethel Life.

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:48.139
And you will be happy to know that periodically we will post more of these to the video

00:42:48.219 --> 00:42:58.699
on-demand portion of JW Broadcasting under the channel, programs, and events. In fact, two more

00:42:58.699 --> 00:43:06.300
morning worship comments are now available for your viewing right after this program concludes.

00:43:07.179 --> 00:43:15.820
And that is not all. Also under programs and events, we have posted, now listen to this.

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:21.659
The entire graduation of the 137th Class of Gillian.

00:43:23.099 --> 00:43:28.059
Additionally, earlier this month, the annual meeting of the Watchtower Bible and Track Society

00:43:28.059 --> 00:43:36.300
of Pennsylvania was held in Jersey City, New Jersey. You will be happy to know that the

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:43.500
scriptural talks and related videos can also be viewed on JW Broadcasting

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:52.500
under the programs and events channel. Ecclesiastes 121 tells you young ones

00:43:53.539 --> 00:44:02.179
to remember your grand creator in the days of your youth before the sad effects of old age set in.

00:44:03.699 --> 00:44:10.420
Very good counsel indeed. But what about those who were not raised in a Christian household?

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:17.380
What about someone who did not learn the truth until he was in his late 80s?

00:44:18.739 --> 00:44:26.019
We received a video interview from outside of Bethel that we would like to share with you at this time.

00:44:27.219 --> 00:44:35.780
When this was recorded, brother Bert Mann from North Bend, Washington was 91 years old.

00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:45.920
My parents died when I was 12 years old. I slept on the cold streets of Chicago,

00:44:46.880 --> 00:45:01.360
ate out of garbage cans in order to survive. At age 18, I thought my escape was the army,

00:45:02.079 --> 00:45:14.300
but the war left me nothing but nightmares. Then I became a workaholic. I wasn't there for my family

00:45:15.019 --> 00:45:26.849
and I regretted it to this day. I came to North Bend at the age of 69 and I became a walker.

00:45:28.449 --> 00:45:37.570
And as I would walk, I got to know people. And one day a car pulls up alongside of me and they offered

00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:45.099
me some literature. And I said, well, what is this all about? What was your home and witnesses?

00:45:45.099 --> 00:45:52.780
I immediately said no because I heard negative things about the witnesses and I believed them.

00:45:53.980 --> 00:46:00.699
But they were persistent and they were there every week as I walked. What's the week? They'd

00:46:00.699 --> 00:46:10.619
offer me the literature and I always said no. Finally, this is five years went by. I said,

00:46:10.619 --> 00:46:19.820
quit being a stubborn mule. At least read it. I put the literature down and at the backside of

00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:26.860
the literature, the watchtower, and bowl letters which you'd like a free Bible study caught my eye.

00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:33.260
And being a frugal guy and from the old school, I never got anything for nothing. I'm going for it.

00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:42.539
The brother I studied with was very patient. And he said, now you can learn the truth

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:47.820
and you can be forgiven. And I couldn't believe what I was hearing.

00:46:49.579 --> 00:46:57.420
I knew, I mean, a chance to redeem myself. Well, I certainly want it in the worst way.

00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:07.739
After learning the truth, I became baptized at 87 years old.

00:47:10.659 --> 00:47:15.380
In my wildest dreams, all my friends can't believe it. Nobody can.

00:47:16.099 --> 00:47:23.139
Bert, he's a witness and he's baptized. Wow, if he can do it, anybody could.

00:47:24.179 --> 00:47:30.260
I'm so grateful. I have a new life. I have an outlook now. At my age,

00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:38.179
there's nothing to look at or the four walls. But now I have brothers and sisters. I have family.

00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:42.659
I have family around the world. I can go anywhere and do well.

00:47:44.659 --> 00:47:49.219
I'm in my third year of pioneering. What a blessing it's been.

00:47:51.139 --> 00:48:02.699
I have finally become something at 91. I'm teaching other people now what the little

00:48:02.699 --> 00:48:16.530
that I know. Thank you, Jehovah. 91, and serving as a ministerial servant and regular pioneer.

00:48:18.289 --> 00:48:23.170
We're sure looking back that brother man would have loved to have used his whole life

00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:30.690
in service to Jehovah. Well, he did not have that opportunity. But it is obvious. He treasures

00:48:30.690 --> 00:48:39.969
the privilege now. Truly, being in the truth at any age is the best life anyone could hope for,

00:48:39.969 --> 00:48:46.130
even in this present system. That thought brings us to the next segment of our program.

00:48:47.170 --> 00:48:54.210
It is a music video entitled The Best Life Ever. Please enjoy.

00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:32.769
Yeah, to be done. These two have take some love. A super next your heart to this world would bring me

00:50:32.769 --> 00:51:52.989
down others off the ground. It's the best feeling. It's better than the dreams. It's the best feeling ever.

00:51:52.989 --> 00:52:25.250
You'll see this is the this is the this is the a 30 second segment of that song

00:52:25.809 --> 00:52:34.050
was used previously in a video posted on jw.org. We thought though you might enjoy hearing the

00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:41.250
complete song. It is hope that the visual images of Jehovah's people enjoying a variety of

00:52:41.250 --> 00:52:49.409
activities will reinforce every young one's determination to stay solid in the truth.

00:52:49.889 --> 00:52:59.889
You young ones are dearly loved by Jehovah and his organization. Even at a young age you have seen

00:52:59.889 --> 00:53:07.889
the light of truth and we commend you warmly for this. The governing body would like to leave

00:53:07.889 --> 00:53:16.769
you children and teenagers with the encouragement found in Ephesians chapter 5 verses 8 through 10.

00:53:17.650 --> 00:53:32.940
At the end of verse 8 it says this go on walking as children of light for the fruities of the light

00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:43.900
consist of every sort of goodness and righteousness and truth. Keep on making sure of what is acceptable

00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:52.929
to the Lord. For your own happy future keep on making sure that what you do and say is pleasing to

00:53:52.929 --> 00:54:01.969
Jehovah. We look forward to using you more and more in Jehovah's organization as you grow to Christian

00:54:01.969 --> 00:54:15.340
maturity. We hope all of you enjoyed this first transmission from JW Broadcasting. Please tune

00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:22.380
back in during November for another interesting presentation. In the meantime be sure to check

00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:30.219
our video on demand channels designed for your spiritual encouragement. But now we want to close

00:54:30.219 --> 00:54:36.460
the program with this footage of some of the thousands of international convention delegates who

00:54:36.460 --> 00:54:44.860
came to visit us here at World Headquarters. Until next time this program is coming to you from

00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:52.059
JW Broadcasting in Brooklyn, New York.
