00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:11.419
Now if you just take a look at today's text, it says, come and witness the activities of

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:15.279
Jehovah, witness.

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:22.300
Now according to a dictionary, a witness is someone who has personal knowledge of something.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.579
So how can we be witnesses of Jehovah?

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:31.699
What personal knowledge do we have of his activities?

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:38.219
Well, first of all, we can testify to the fact that Jehovah can see into the future.

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.060
And when he does that, he's right, 100% of the time.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:48.899
And second, we know that no one can prevent what Jehovah foresees from coming true.

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.859
All of Jehovah's prophecies come true.

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:58.539
Now to illustrate the first point that Jehovah can see into the future, let's consider

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:06.819
two remarkable prophecies concerning the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple.

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:12.099
Now we know that through the Prophet Jeremiah, Jehovah foretold that Jerusalem and the temple

00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:14.939
would be destroyed by the Babylonians.

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.819
Did it come true?

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:17.819
Absolutely.

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:20.500
In 607 BCE.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.379
But Jehovah went further.

00:01:22.379 --> 00:01:26.819
He said that Jerusalem would be rebuilt.

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:29.620
They will rebuild the ancient ruins.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.739
They will raise up the desolated places of the past, and they will restore the devastated

00:01:35.739 --> 00:01:37.620
cities.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.219
And true worship would also be restored.

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:44.659
So that was quite a level of knowledge.

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.019
But there's more, Jehovah went further.

00:01:48.019 --> 00:01:54.140
Jehovah also indicated that the spiritual revival wouldn't last.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.980
Now that is remarkable.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.939
And it's implied by what we read in the second part of Daniel chapter 9 and verse 26.

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.260
I'd like you to have a look at this.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.900
We're going to be reading two parts of this verse.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.580
It's quite interesting.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.060
Daniel chapter 9 and verse 26.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:26.780
So now what's our objective here is to see that Jerusalem and its temple would be destroyed

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.219
a second time and the true worship would not last.

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:34.259
It says in the second part of verse 26.

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:43.740
And the people of a leader who is coming will destroy the city and the holy place.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.620
Now when these words were written, Jerusalem and the temple were already in ruins.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.060
But Jehovah doesn't say Nebuchadnezzar has destroyed the city and its temple.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:03.860
He says the people of a leader who is coming, the Roman general Titus in 70 CE, will destroy

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.659
the city and the holy place.

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:12.460
In order for that prophecy to be fulfilled, Jerusalem and the temple would have to be rebuilt

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.659
and then destroyed a second time.

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:20.460
Now that is quite a level of knowledge, quite a level of information.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.180
But what would make this necessary?

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:30.819
Why when the Jews came back to their to the promised land and they were intent on restoring

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.460
true worship?

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:37.860
Why would this fail and why would Jerusalem and the temple be destroyed a second time?

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.419
Part of it is due to what we find in the first part of verse 26.

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:48.080
Messiah will be cut off.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:58.120
So Jehovah foretold, foresaw that when the Messiah came, the Jews would reject him.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.159
He would be cut off.

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:06.039
And because of that, partly because of that, Jerusalem and the temple would be destroyed

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:10.000
as it happens in 70 CE.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.599
Now wait a minute.

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.400
Let's think about that a minute.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:22.680
The Messiah comes first and Jerusalem and the temple are destroyed after that in 70 CE.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.240
What does that mean?

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.279
It means that the Messiah comes before 70 CE.

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:35.240
So we might ask our Jewish friends, why are you still waiting for the Messiah?

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.279
70 CE has come and gone.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:46.279
And he too proved to be a true prophet and a remarkable prophecy of Jesus is found in

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:48.000
the Sermon on the Mount.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.040
Let's have a look at it and consider the implications of this prophecy.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:05:05.139
This is Matthew chapter 7 and we'll read verses 22 and 23, an amazing prophecy.

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:12.920
Now imagine at this point, Jesus' teachings have not spread beyond Israel.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:21.279
Notice verses 22 and 23, many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:27.720
in your name and expel demons in your name and perform many powerful works in your name?

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.600
And then I will declare to them, I never knew you.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.120
Get away from me, you workers of lawlessness.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.199
Now it's not amazing.

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:41.319
If Jesus had simply predicted that his teachings would spread throughout the earth, you might

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:44.160
say, well, there's nothing remarkable about that.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.680
But Jesus is saying something different.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.480
Jesus is for telling a great apostasy from his teachings.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:06:00.759
Jesus is for telling the birth of Christendom 300 years before the event.

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:07.839
So Jesus foresees that many are going to turn away from the truth.

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:13.279
And by the end of the first century, that apostasy was already at work, wasn't it?

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:19.519
There were sects, the sect of Nicolias, for example, and other sects.

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:24.600
And now they're on the cusp of the great darkness, the great apostasy that's going to

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.920
set in from the second century on.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.120
And with this in mind, what does Jehovah do?

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.079
He makes an amazing statement.

00:06:36.079 --> 00:06:38.079
Revelation 14.

00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:43.439
144,000 will be on Mount Zion with the Lamb.

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:47.480
There were nowhere near 144,000 in the truth in the first century.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:53.639
And here, Jehovah is saying, there are going to be 144,000 in heaven with the Lamb at the

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:54.639
end.

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:56.839
But not only that, he goes further.

00:06:56.839 --> 00:07:00.319
There's going to be a great crowd that no man can number.

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:03.120
How could that ever come true?

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.279
Ours is the God of true prophecy.

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:09.079
Well that's prophecy.

00:07:09.079 --> 00:07:10.839
What about the second point?

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:15.040
And that is that no one can prevent prophecy from being fulfilled.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.160
The devil would love to prevent that from taking place.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.079
Think about Revelation 14.

00:07:20.079 --> 00:07:27.959
If the devil could make the number one short of 144,000, he'd be happy because he would

00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:32.439
show that Jehovah was inaccurate in what he foretold.

00:07:32.439 --> 00:07:37.800
And so that's one of the reasons why the devil has made war on the remnant of the seed

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.480
of the woman.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:47.160
If it all possible to prevent that number of 144,000 from coming to pass, but of course,

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.040
he's going to fail.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:54.600
And what about the prophecy in the Bible that America and Britain would become a dual

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.920
world power?

00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:00.560
Now, Britain wouldn't become a world power at all if France had anything to say about

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.560
it.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:08.240
France and Britain were sworn enemies, and for many, many years France was much richer

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:13.000
and much more powerful than Britain was.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.800
And finally, at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, France had one last chance to prevent

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.839
Britain from becoming a world power.

00:08:22.839 --> 00:08:25.680
And France should have won that battle.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.879
Everything was stacked against the British.

00:08:28.879 --> 00:08:36.960
But there was a driving rain, a fatal miscalculation on the part of Napoleon and a few other factors

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.960
that foiled their attempt.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.480
And Britain did become a world power.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:47.340
And at the end of the 19th century, it's quite true that the sun never set on the British

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.360
empire.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.919
But now, America and Britain were supposed to become a dual world power.

00:08:53.919 --> 00:08:58.559
And Britain wasn't the least bit interested in sharing its power with America.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:04.200
It tried to prevent America from separating as a colony.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:09.000
There was a long war, and there were mistakes made on both sides.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.120
But finally, America gained its independence from Britain.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:16.440
And what do we find some years after that?

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.720
Britain is sharing its power with America.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:23.799
They are a dual world power.

00:09:23.799 --> 00:09:27.559
Fighters against God will never prevail.

00:09:27.559 --> 00:09:33.879
We serve the God of true prophecy, and what he foretells comes to be.
