00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:04.849
Does something exist because you believe it does?

00:00:05.929 --> 00:00:10.250
Does something not exist simply because you don't believe in it?

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:18.730
No, truth is based on evidence, but what kind of evidence convinces you that something exists?

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:26.210
We believe in many things. We can't see air, wind, atoms, electricity, gravity, time, and

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:32.689
and we believe in things we can't hear, galaxies, dog whistles, microorganisms.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.729
We also believe in things we can't feel, such as our brain, or the rotation of the earth.

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:51.490
But why? What convinces you the effects, effects that you can see, hear, feel, and measure,

00:00:52.289 --> 00:01:00.289
and the testimony from those who know the facts? Evidence. Evidence is the basis for faith.

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:08.769
Today, many people don't believe that God exists. Their lack of faith can affect us,

00:01:08.769 --> 00:01:15.730
indeed, our faith is under attack. This symposium will remind us of our reasons for faith,

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:23.730
and will help us to strengthen our faith. We'll consider why we have faith in God's existence,

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:33.569
in His Word, in His moral standards, and in His love. First, why is faith in God's existence

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:42.689
important? Please find Ephesians chapter 2. And notice how the Apostle Paul describes Christians

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:51.090
in Ephesus before they knew the true God, Ephesians chapter 2, and verse 1 reads,

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:59.650
Furthermore, God made you alive, though you were dead in your trespasses and sins,

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:08.689
and verse 12 continues, at that time you were without Christ, alienated from the state of Israel,

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:16.610
strangers to the covenants of the promise you had no hope, and were without God in the world.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:25.490
The same was true for us, but faith in the existence of the Creator has given our lives meaning,

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:31.490
and purpose, it has unlocked the answers to such questions as, why does the universe exist,

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:37.090
and what does the future hold? True, there are people who shy away from such questions,

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.449
thinking that the answers are just beyond us, some even teach that there is no purpose,

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:49.409
no ultimate meaning in life. But where does that leave them, without reliable guidance?

00:02:50.370 --> 00:03:01.569
In contrast, notice what Psalm 11110 teaches us about the effect of our faith. Psalm 111 verse 10

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:13.009
says, the fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom, all those observing his orders show good

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:21.650
insight, his praise, indoors forever. Yes, clear thinking and practical application of knowledge

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:30.129
begin with regarding the Creator with awe and profound respect, and as indicated in the very

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:36.449
next verse, this makes us happier people. That's why we need to safeguard our faith. It's the

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:43.569
foundation for our relationship with God, the basis for our hope, the key to our future.

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:51.889
So let's remind ourselves why we can have faith in God's existence. Let's go back to the chapter

00:03:51.889 --> 00:04:03.569
of the Bible that defines faith. Hebrews chapter 11, Hebrews 111 tells us that faith is the

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:10.610
convincing evidence of realities that are not seen. But now what would be an example of that?

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:22.180
Let's read together Hebrews 113. It says, by faith, we perceive that the systems of things were put

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:32.019
in order by God's word so that what is seen has come into existence from things that are not visible,

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:40.579
the systems of things. What might be some of those systems? Could this include our solar system

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.779
and the galactic system that it's a part of and the smaller cycles that occur within our solar system?

00:04:48.579 --> 00:04:54.019
Think about our Earth's atmosphere, which protects us from the sun's harmful rays while at the same

00:04:54.019 --> 00:05:00.579
time allowing the entry of essential heat and light. Just think what would happen to us were it

00:05:00.579 --> 00:05:08.500
not for our atmosphere's protective shield. We'd burn up in seconds. And besides a blocking out

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:15.939
harmful rays, the atmosphere along with Earth's magnetic field also absorbs much of the debris

00:05:16.019 --> 00:05:25.300
that flies through space. By faith, we perceive that these systems were put in order by God's word.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:33.939
Or think about the Earth's amazing cycles. Imagine what would happen if a city's water supply,

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:42.100
its fresh air, its water were disrupted and the sewers were blocked. What would be the quality

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:50.980
of life in that city? And yet, our planet is a closed system. Clean air and water are not

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:57.779
shipped in from outer space. Waste matter is not rocketed out. So how does the Earth remain

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:06.420
healthy and habitable? The water cycle, the carbon and oxygen cycles, and the nitrogen cycle,

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:14.100
all tuned precisely to sustain life. Of course, this doesn't mean that we can be careless

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:20.819
stewards of our planet, but what remarkable systems and much more could be said about the Earth's

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:27.620
perfect location in our solar system or about the planet's perfect orbit, tilt, rotational speed

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:34.899
and unusual moon or about our solar system's perfect position in the Milky Way. Are all of these

00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:43.060
precise locations and elegant measurements the result of blind chance or of purposeful design?

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:51.540
As you watch the following video, note yet another example of how the order evident in creation

00:06:51.540 --> 00:07:01.920
clearly points to an all-wise creator. Our bodies are made up of trillions of cells.

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:09.649
Yet each individual cell is a marvel of design and organization.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:18.370
Inside our cells, biological processes signal specific proteins to assemble themselves into

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:27.660
tracks called microtubules. Tiny molecular machines called kinesens then transport various

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:39.060
components to different parts of the cell by walking along the tracks, from microscopic proteins

00:07:43.009 --> 00:07:51.970
to enormous galaxies. Our organized universe abounds with examples of elegant design.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:07.120
How can you strengthen your faith in God's existence? Consider three things that we can do. Please

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:16.240
open your Bibles to Romans chapter 1. When we consider examples like these of God's power and wisdom,

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:22.959
it doesn't make us wonder how could anyone deny the evidence of an intelligent and loving designer.

00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:33.200
Romans 118 indicates that such denial requires suppressing the truth. Why? Well, notice what it says

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:48.080
at Romans 119. Because what may be known about God is clearly evident. Clearly evident among them.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:55.039
For God made it clear to them. Verse 20 says, for his invisible qualities are clearly seen from

00:08:55.039 --> 00:09:02.080
the world's creation onward because they are perceived by the things made, even his eternal power

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:09.039
and Godship so that they, namely those who suppress the truth, are inexcusable.

00:09:10.159 --> 00:09:16.879
God's existence and his qualities were apparent the moment mankind first appeared on earth.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.960
And the evidence has only become clearer with the passage of time and the advancement of technology

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:29.519
that enables us to discover what God has done. So that's the first way that we strengthen our faith

00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:38.399
in God's existence through study and meditation, meditating on the evidence. And to help us with this,

00:09:39.039 --> 00:09:45.679
we find an abundance of published material about creation on JW.org where we find brochures,

00:09:45.679 --> 00:09:50.559
articles in the series, was it designed and interviews with scientists?

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:57.679
The second way that we strengthen our faith is by earnestly praying for more faith.

00:09:57.679 --> 00:10:04.320
Jesus said as recorded at Luke 1113 that God will give his Holy Spirit to those asking him for it,

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:12.080
and part of that Spirit's fruitage is faith. Third, we strengthen our faith by building the faith

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:18.799
of others. How? By drawing attention to the evidence that supports the truth. Parents,

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:24.799
patiently build the faith of your children. If they have doubts, address them promptly, kindly,

00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:31.440
don't dismiss their questions and don't get upset. Be glad they asked. It shows they care and they

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:37.759
want to understand, accept the challenge, present the evidence, look for it together when you sit in your

00:10:37.759 --> 00:10:44.320
house, when you walk on the road, when you lie down, and when you get up. In the following video,

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:48.960
note what strengthens the faith of one of our brothers who is a scientist.

00:10:51.299 --> 00:10:56.019
As a mechanical design educator, I view even natural things from a design perspective.

00:10:57.059 --> 00:11:03.460
Mechanical design considers not only the individual components of a machine, but also how they interact.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:10.340
From this viewpoint, human vision is a magnificent example of design.

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:17.860
For a single eye, the cornea, the iris, and the lens interact to focus an image on the retina.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:23.139
The light-sensitive cells of the retina call photoreceptors produce nerve signals.

00:11:24.019 --> 00:11:29.139
Signals from the rod and cone photoreceptors are transmitted by the optic nerve

00:11:29.139 --> 00:11:32.740
to the brain with their process to produce a perceived image.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:39.379
Now, just imagine the multiplied complexity when two eyes interact.

00:11:41.139 --> 00:11:46.659
Particularly mind-boggling is the amount of information being constantly processed

00:11:47.299 --> 00:11:54.259
by more than 130 million retinal receptors and then transmitted through the 1.2 million

00:11:54.259 --> 00:12:02.179
nerve fibers of the optic nerve to the brain. To me, the sheer complexity of how all these

00:12:02.179 --> 00:12:09.779
components flawlessly interact is evidence of a superior designer. Some disagree.

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:16.500
They propose that the eye evolve from a light-sensitive patch in some ancestral creature through

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:25.860
small random changes. I find the proposed process unrealistic. Unlike design, it is unplanned

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:33.059
and without a goal. We are asked to imagine that a complex system can develop without direction

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:39.539
while in the natural world things tend to become disorganized, but consider something even more

00:12:39.539 --> 00:12:46.740
mind-boggling. The design of the eye, the optic nerve, and brain, and how they function and interact

00:12:47.539 --> 00:12:54.500
are completely documented in our DNA. In fact, our DNA contains all the instructions

00:12:54.500 --> 00:13:01.460
for building an entire human body. While science relies only on physical explanations,

00:13:02.259 --> 00:13:08.980
many individual scientists reason that highly-ordered natural systems are evidence of a designer.

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:16.659
My personal conclusion is that there is a God who is revealed in the magnificent designs

00:13:16.659 --> 00:13:23.409
of nature. How does faith in God's existence benefit us?

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:30.210
Having genuine faith in the loving, intelligent designer of this universe gives our lives

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:37.250
meaning and purpose. That faith is the basis for obedience to Jehovah's Righteous Standard,

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:44.450
standards that benefit us. But we don't fear the future because faith gives us hope. We don't

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:51.730
fear death because our hope is in the source of life. How happy we are that Jehovah has provided

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:59.809
abundant evidence that he exists, and yet are there facets of Jehovah's personality that we

00:13:59.809 --> 00:14:06.610
couldn't fully comprehend from a study of creation alone? Yes, and for this we need to study his

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:14.769
inspired word. How can we strengthen our faith in God's Word? Please pay careful attention to

00:14:14.769 --> 00:14:19.809
Brother Mark Newmer, a helper to the teaching committee, as he now presents the next talk of this

00:14:19.809 --> 00:14:27.009
symposium, why we have faith in God's Word.
