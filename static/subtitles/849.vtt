00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:06.259
The day was nice in 1133 CE.

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:12.859
Jesus was busy in the temple teaching just a few days prior to his death.

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:19.780
He silenced the scribes and the Pharisees with his irrefutable logic, at the same time

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.620
sharing some of the most profound teachings of his earthly ministry.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:32.899
For instance, pay back Caesar's things to Caesar, but God's things to God.

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:42.380
Then one of the scribes came forward and asked Jesus, what is the greatest commandment?

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.780
How did Jesus respond?

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:51.380
His response would have far-reaching implications even down to our day for anyone claiming

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.259
to be a Christian.

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:58.380
We find his response in Mark chapter 12, I invite you to turn there.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.939
Mark chapter 12, and notice please with me verses 29 and 30.

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:11.540
Mark 12, 29 and 30, Jesus answered the first or the most important commandment.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:18.579
The greatest commandment is, here, O Israel, Jehovah, our God is one Jehovah.

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:26.659
And you must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.579
with your whole mind and with your whole strength.

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:36.060
You must love Jehovah, love God.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.299
It sounds simple, right?

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:44.500
Well billions of people claim to love God, but they love pleasures more, or they're

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:51.540
willing to fight and kill their fellow man, or they refuse to live by God's moral standards.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.219
All such things contradict their claim to love God.

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:02.140
Well Jesus demonstrated that love of God requires more than a feeling of affection.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.060
Jesus stressed how completely we must love God with our whole heart, with our whole soul,

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.780
with our whole mind, with our whole strength.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.500
Does that leave anything out?

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.620
Our eyes, our ears, our hands?

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.780
Well the study notes on verse 30 help us to understand that this includes our emotions,

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.020
desires, and feelings.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.620
It includes our intellectual faculties and power of reason.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.699
It includes our physical and mental strength.

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:36.500
Yes, our whole being, all that we are, we must devote to our love to Jehovah.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.099
Love for God must govern a person's entire life.

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.939
Nothing is left out.

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:48.300
Well, shortly after emphasizing the greatest commandment, and again we're thinking of Jesus,

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.780
he's there in the temple shortly after emphasizing the greatest commandment, Jesus shines a light

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:01.210
on both bad and good examples of love for God.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.849
First he sharply condemned the scribes and the Pharisees for their pretense of love for

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:06.849
God.

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:13.030
Now, if you want the full condemnation, it's found in Matthew chapter 23.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:20.110
Those hypocrites, they gave even the tenth or a tithe of small tiny herbs, but they ignored

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.729
the weightier matters of justice and mercy and faithfulness.

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:27.090
That was the bad example.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:33.090
But then Jesus gave his attention to an outstanding example of love for God.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:40.460
If you're still there in Mark chapter 12, notice starting in verse 41.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.819
And Jesus sat down with the treasury chests in view and began observing how the crowd

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:49.139
was dropping money into the treasury chests.

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:52.860
And many rich people were dropping in many coins.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:58.780
Now a poor widow came and dropped in two small coins, a very little value.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.740
So he called his disciples to him and said to them, truly, I say to you that this poor

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:09.139
widow put in more than all the others who put money into the treasury chests.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:15.180
So they all put in out of their surplus, but she, out of her want, put in everything she

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.560
had, all she had to live on.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.399
The coins of the needy widow were worth about 15 minutes wages.

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:28.120
Yet Jesus expressed his father's view of her worship.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.240
He commended her whole soul's sacrifice.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.240
What do we learn?

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.600
Well, clearly the lessons go far beyond material giving.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.800
Life in our worship of Jehovah is important to him.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:50.120
Jehovah doesn't compare us with others or even previous versions of ourselves, younger

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.920
versions of ourselves.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.879
Jehovah simply wants love for him with our whole heart, soul, mind, and strength.

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:06.040
Not as they were 10 or 20 years ago, but as they currently are now.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.600
Now a question in reference to love for Jehovah.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:15.800
Is it reasonable for Jehovah to expect us to love him with our whole heart, soul,

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.519
mind, and strength?

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:19.600
Is it reasonable?

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.399
Yes, absolutely.

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:24.800
Why can we say that?

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:32.160
Because Jehovah loves us with his whole heart, soul, mind, and strength.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.160
How so?

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.720
Well, let's turn to Isaiah chapters 40 through 44.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.879
And there will consider a few of the many reasons we have to love Jehovah.

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:49.720
And at the same time, we'll consider some examples of the depth of Jehovah's love for us.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:57.459
So our first example is in Isaiah chapter 40 and notice, please verse 11, Isaiah 40 verse

00:05:57.459 --> 00:05:58.459
11.

00:05:58.459 --> 00:06:04.100
There it says, like a shepherd, he will care for his flock.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.819
With his arm, he will gather together the lambs and in his bosom, he will carry them.

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:11.019
He will gently lead those nursing their young.

00:06:11.019 --> 00:06:13.420
Here we find a beautiful word picture of Jehovah.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:18.100
Jehovah is a tender shepherd.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:25.180
At Ezekiel chapter 34 verses 15 and 16, Jehovah says, I myself will feed my sheep.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.300
The last one I will search for, the stray, I will bring back the injured, I will bandage

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:35.379
as we notice in the illustration and the weak, I will strengthen what a touching picture

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:39.819
of compassion and tender care.

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:46.379
If we fall and hurt ourselves, or if we stumble in the briar patch, sort of speak, Jehovah

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:48.579
bandages us.

00:06:48.579 --> 00:06:50.740
He helps us to heal.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.339
When we seek his help, he doesn't reproach us.

00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:56.980
You should have known better, no.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:01.779
But he does try to help us not to stray in the future with reminders from his word.

00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:03.579
And what is the effect on the sheep?

00:07:03.579 --> 00:07:07.420
So as we saw in the illustration, he feels secure in Jehovah's care.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.220
How do we feel in Jehovah's care?

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.819
His compassion at care.

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:13.060
We too feel secure.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:20.939
We might say that Jehovah loves us with all his heart, his compassion.

00:07:20.939 --> 00:07:25.540
Doesn't that increase your love for him?

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.939
Let's consider a second reason why we have that we have to love Jehovah.

00:07:28.939 --> 00:07:34.620
Isaiah chapter 40, notice verses 28 and 29.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.980
Verse 28 says, Do you not know?

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.899
Have you not heard?

00:07:38.899 --> 00:07:43.939
Jehovah, the creator of the ends of the earth, is a God for all eternity.

00:07:43.939 --> 00:07:47.420
He never tires out or grows weary.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.300
His understanding is unsearchable.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:57.420
He gives power to the tired one and full might to those lacking strength.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:09.129
With Jehovah's mighty Holy Spirit, he created everything beginning with his first born son

00:08:09.129 --> 00:08:15.649
to myriads of mighty spirit creatures, to the vast universe with its trillions upon trillions

00:08:15.649 --> 00:08:21.170
of stars, to this beautiful earth with its endless variety of plant and animal life,

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:26.730
to the human body with its awe-inspiring ability and versatility.

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:32.220
Jehovah is truly the almighty creator.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.860
Now think about this.

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:41.019
What happens when you or I become completely exhausted, completely tired, maybe at the end

00:08:41.019 --> 00:08:43.940
of a long day, when a human becomes physically tired?

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.500
How does he recharge?

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:50.139
Do we plug into a charging station like an electric car?

00:08:50.139 --> 00:08:51.940
No.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:57.580
We're marvelously designed to recharge through rest and the food that we take into our

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:58.940
bodies are fuel.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.980
The calories, the energy and food are evidence of Jehovah's love.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:08.419
Not only does it recharge us, but it brings us delight, too.

00:09:08.419 --> 00:09:11.220
What did you have for breakfast?

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.980
Maybe here at the assembly hall.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:19.539
The average glazed doughnut contains about 190 to 300 calories.

00:09:19.539 --> 00:09:26.340
We hope you're not counting calories during this annual meeting season.

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:33.259
But whatever your choice, the energy and food is a gift of Almighty God to help sustain

00:09:33.259 --> 00:09:35.059
us, to recharge us.

00:09:35.059 --> 00:09:42.340
And now a question that we ask, though, what happens when we become tired of dealing with

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:45.299
life's trials?

00:09:45.299 --> 00:09:49.340
Maybe with problems that don't have a solution in this system of things.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:56.820
Well, when we maintain a good spiritual routine, then Jehovah gives us power, power to the

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:58.179
tired one.

00:09:58.179 --> 00:10:03.820
His Holy Spirit strengthens us, enables us to go forward in the battle yet another day.

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:07.700
The power beyond what is normal strengthens us.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.460
Yes, Jehovah gives power to the tired one.

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:16.279
We might say that Jehovah loves us with all his strength.

00:10:16.279 --> 00:10:20.519
Doesn't that draw you to him as a person?

00:10:20.519 --> 00:10:23.320
Let's consider another reason we have to love Jehovah.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:32.340
This time in Isaiah chapter 41, verses 10 and 13, there our God says,

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:38.340
Do not be afraid, for I am with you.

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:41.580
Do not be anxious for I am your God.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.419
I will fortify you, yes, I will help you.

00:10:44.419 --> 00:10:50.179
I will really hold on to you with my right hand of righteousness.

00:10:50.179 --> 00:10:57.100
Verse 13, for I Jehovah your God am grasping your right hand.

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:04.750
The one saying to you, Do not be afraid, I will help you.

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:13.480
Jehovah is our helper, Jehovah grasps our right hand with his right hand of righteousness.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:19.960
In other words, he at times pulls us out of distressing circumstances in life.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.960
Jehovah rescued his people from slavery in Egypt.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:29.159
Isaiah 63 verse 9 says, During all their distress, it was distressing to him and he lifted

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:34.830
them up and carried them all the days of old.

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:41.820
When was the last time that Jehovah rescued you from a trial?

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:48.860
In Psalm 18, David used very poetic language to describe Jehovah's remarkable ability to

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.379
rescue us.

00:11:50.379 --> 00:11:56.379
Psalm 18 verses 8 through 10, smoke ascended from his nostrils, and a consuming fire came

00:11:56.379 --> 00:11:57.379
from his mouth.

00:11:57.379 --> 00:12:01.899
He made the heavens bend as he descended, and thick gloom was beneath his feet.

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:04.100
He rode on a cherub and came flying.

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.299
He swooped down on the wings of a spirit.

00:12:06.299 --> 00:12:11.679
Verse 16 says, He reached down from on high.

00:12:11.679 --> 00:12:17.320
He took hold of me and pulled me from deep waters.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.600
Verse 19, He brought me out into a place of safety.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:28.070
He rescued me because he was pleased with me.

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:32.350
Can you imagine Jehovah reaching down with his right hand of righteousness and rescuing

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:35.700
you from a trial?

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.860
Why?

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:46.129
Because Jehovah loves us with all his soul, his whole being.

00:12:46.129 --> 00:12:48.529
How does that make you feel?

00:12:48.529 --> 00:12:54.519
Does it draw you closer to your Heavenly Father?

00:12:54.519 --> 00:12:58.320
Let's consider a fourth reason we have to love Jehovah.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:03.620
Isaiah chapter 42 verses 8 and 9.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.220
It says, I am Jehovah.

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.059
That is my name.

00:13:08.059 --> 00:13:12.539
I give my glory to no one else, nor my praise to graven images.

00:13:12.539 --> 00:13:15.259
See, the first things have come to pass.

00:13:15.259 --> 00:13:17.259
Now I am declaring new things.

00:13:17.259 --> 00:13:22.700
Before they spring up, I tell you about them.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.139
Why is this a reason to love Jehovah?

00:13:25.139 --> 00:13:27.340
He's a God of prophecy.

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:28.820
What does that mean in simple terms?

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.419
Well, Jehovah keeps his promises.

00:13:30.419 --> 00:13:37.220
It's linked to his name, Jehovah, which we understand to mean he causes to become.

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:44.659
Not one word of all his good promise that he made through Moses, his servant, has failed.

00:13:44.659 --> 00:13:47.480
You said it.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:53.080
Well, Joshua and Solomon both expressed similar thoughts.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:58.720
But now here we are 3,000 years after Solomon.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.919
We have more reasons to say that.

00:14:01.919 --> 00:14:04.200
More prophecies have been fulfilled since then.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:07.000
God's kingdom rules.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.159
Pure worship has been restored.

00:14:09.159 --> 00:14:17.519
We can emphatically say not one word of all Jehovah's good promises has failed.

00:14:17.519 --> 00:14:21.080
But how does that make us love him more?

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.840
Well prophecy is the basis for hope.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:33.360
So when we hear Isaiah 33, 24, or John 5, 28, and 29, or Revelation 21, 3, and 4, we think

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:41.000
about the effect that the disappearance of sickness, pain, and death will have for us and

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:49.259
for our loved ones, the resurrection.

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:54.000
Do you long to welcome back loved ones?

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.610
It's as good as done.

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:00.529
God's personal name is a guarantee.

00:15:00.529 --> 00:15:06.289
Jehovah makes the dead alive and calls the things that are not as though they are.

00:15:06.289 --> 00:15:07.450
Why?

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:13.950
Because his promises are absolutely certain of fulfillment.

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:17.750
Jeremiah chapter 29 verse 11.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:23.190
There Jehovah says, I will know the thoughts that I am thinking toward you.

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:27.629
Lots of peace and not of calamity to give you a future and a hope.

00:15:27.629 --> 00:15:31.909
We might say Jehovah loves us with all his mind.

00:15:31.909 --> 00:15:37.309
Jehovah will make his very own thoughts toward you a reality.

00:15:37.309 --> 00:15:39.309
How does that make you feel?

00:15:39.309 --> 00:15:44.669
Well, from Isaiah's prophecy, we've considered just four reasons to love Jehovah.

00:15:44.669 --> 00:15:46.909
First, he's our shepherd.

00:15:46.909 --> 00:15:48.710
Second, he's our creator.

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:50.590
Third, he's our helper.

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:52.710
And finally, he's a God of prophecy.

00:15:52.789 --> 00:15:55.429
Certainly you can think of other reasons to love Jehovah.

00:15:55.429 --> 00:15:59.590
Note what a few individuals said when asked why they particularly love Jehovah.

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:04.629
One brother said, I love Jehovah because he listens to my prayers.

00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:07.429
When sister said, Jehovah is approachable.

00:16:07.429 --> 00:16:12.029
It's a privilege to have a friend who I can talk to at any moment of the day and know that

00:16:12.029 --> 00:16:14.789
he will understand me.

00:16:14.789 --> 00:16:20.309
Another sister said, because of all the things he made for absolutely no reason except that

00:16:20.309 --> 00:16:23.389
he loves us.

00:16:23.389 --> 00:16:26.509
We don't need to taste food to survive.

00:16:26.509 --> 00:16:28.830
The sunset doesn't need to be beautiful.

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:32.590
Music doesn't have to exist, but it does.

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:40.750
One reason I love Jehovah is because he goes above and beyond and is love for us.

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:46.350
Another brother said this, I love Jehovah for his forgiveness.

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:50.149
And really, doesn't that bring to our minds Jehovah's greatest expression of love?

00:16:50.149 --> 00:16:54.309
The ransom sacrifice of his son, Jesus.

00:16:54.309 --> 00:16:58.029
So the question for each of us, why do I love Jehovah?

00:16:58.029 --> 00:17:01.549
Why do you love Jehovah?

00:17:01.549 --> 00:17:04.789
Well, what does our love motivate us to do?

00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:11.539
It's linked with the words of Isaiah chapter 43, verse 10.

00:17:11.539 --> 00:17:16.940
Isaiah 43, verse 10, Jehovah says, you are my witnesses.

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:19.940
Yes, my servant whom I have chosen.

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:26.900
While thrilling, it must have been a 1931 to hear brother Rutherford express the new name

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:32.460
that we've come to cherish, 1931, Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:35.259
And for what purpose has Jehovah chosen us as witnesses?

00:17:35.259 --> 00:17:41.980
Isaiah 43, notice verse 21, it says, the people whom I formed for myself so that they might

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.019
declare my praise.

00:17:44.019 --> 00:17:47.019
Jehovah has chosen us to declare his praise.

00:17:47.019 --> 00:17:49.539
Love Jehovah.

00:17:49.539 --> 00:17:51.380
Praise Jehovah.

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:54.569
What a privilege.

00:17:54.569 --> 00:17:58.569
Jehovah could use rocks, he could use trees, he could use birds, he could use beasts of

00:17:58.569 --> 00:18:02.009
the field, but no, he's chosen his faithful servants.

00:18:02.009 --> 00:18:06.930
He's chosen you and me to declare his praise.

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:12.329
Recently on a trip to the Western United States, my wife and I were able to observe bison,

00:18:12.329 --> 00:18:15.009
elk, and mousse.

00:18:15.009 --> 00:18:22.930
From a safe distance, of course, they're humongous, very powerful animals.

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:25.930
What if Jehovah had chosen one of them to declare his praise?

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:33.299
Every time you would approach, they would say, praise jaw.

00:18:33.299 --> 00:18:38.630
But he hasn't.

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:40.990
They just eat grass.

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:45.819
They praise Jehovah in a different way.

00:18:45.819 --> 00:18:52.940
But the fact of the matter is, Jehovah has chosen us to declare his praise, to extol his

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:54.940
virtues.

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:59.900
Jehovah isn't looking for programmed praise or forced or coerced praise, but praise

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:03.059
that comes from a heart full of love.

00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:08.740
Love for God's remarkable qualities motivates us to tell the whole world about our great

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:10.539
God.

00:19:10.539 --> 00:19:11.660
But many don't want to listen.

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:14.660
What if we face opposition even from governments?

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:24.059
Isaiah 44 verse 8 is what we need to keep in mind, because as we've considered already,

00:19:24.059 --> 00:19:28.660
during this program, the time will come when we're going to face opposition.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:33.740
Isaiah 44 verse 8, some of our brothers in many places are already facing opposition.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:38.579
Notice what it says, do not be in dread, do not become paralyzed with fear.

00:19:38.579 --> 00:19:43.339
Have I not told each of you beforehand and declared it, you are my witnesses.

00:19:43.339 --> 00:19:45.059
Is there any God but me?

00:19:45.059 --> 00:19:46.460
No, there is no other rock.

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:49.539
I know of none.

00:19:49.539 --> 00:19:56.700
Jehovah says, do not be in dread, do not become paralyzed with fear.

00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:01.140
We back Caesar's things to Caesar, but God's things to God.

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:06.539
Caesar is on shaky ground when he interferes with what God requires.

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:11.220
So rather than being paralyzed with fear, love for Jehovah conquers fear and moves us to

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:14.420
continue praising him.

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:18.539
And we've seized such determination in our international family of witnesses, a faithful

00:20:18.539 --> 00:20:21.259
sister named Tatiana.

00:20:21.259 --> 00:20:25.619
Her criminal case for praising Jehovah is pending, and her husband is currently in

00:20:25.619 --> 00:20:28.099
pretrial detention.

00:20:28.099 --> 00:20:32.759
But she says, during the most difficult moments, I continue to sense that Jehovah is with

00:20:32.759 --> 00:20:39.259
me and I feel confident that with his help, I can endure whatever trials may yet come.

00:20:39.259 --> 00:20:43.900
My heart is filled with peace and calmness.

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:47.539
I am more determined than ever to tell others about Jehovah.

00:20:47.539 --> 00:20:51.940
I am proud to be one of Jehovah's witnesses.

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:59.940
Yes, Tatiana's love for Jehovah moves her to continue praising him.

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:05.779
Well, the Bible doesn't tell us how many hours we have to share in the ministry each month.

00:21:05.779 --> 00:21:11.099
But it does tell us that love for God must be our motivation.

00:21:11.099 --> 00:21:15.900
The greater our love, the fuller our share will be in accord with our personal circumstances.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:20.500
We prove that we are Jehovah's witnesses by our conduct and by our zeal in praising

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.740
him formally and informally.

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:28.240
May our deep love for Jehovah move us to tell as many people as possible about our great

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.500
God, Jehovah.
