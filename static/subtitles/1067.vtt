00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.759
Jehovah is a miracle worker.

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.679
What's a miracle?

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:09.279
How would you describe it?

00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:13.519
Well, let's give a simple definition.

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:20.519
A miracle is a powerful work that can't be explained in human terms.

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.760
Whenever Jehovah performs a miracle, he has a purpose.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.760
And one reason might be to strengthen the faith of his servants, and that's the title

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.039
of this talk, Jehovah's powerful works inspire faith.

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:40.079
Oh, we love to consider the miracles recorded in the Bible.

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.920
It's really faith-strengthening, isn't it?

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.079
So during this talk, we're going to consider just a few.

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:48.759
How about this one?

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:52.320
Jehovah leads the Israelites out of Egypt.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.600
They arrive at the Red Sea, and it seems they're trapped.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.640
They seize ahead of them, Pharaoh and his armies are behind.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.140
But Jehovah causes the waters of the Red Sea to part, and the Israelites cross over on

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.120
dry land.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.640
When Pharaoh and his armies follow, Jehovah brings a sea back to its normal condition and

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.319
the cream of the crop of Egyptian manhood drowns.

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:22.079
Now we know what effect that miracle had on the Egyptians, but what effect did it have

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:24.239
on the Israelites?

00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:29.799
Let's see, Exodus chapter 14, and verse 31, I'll give you a moment so you can find

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:31.280
that.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:38.640
Exodus chapter 14, and verse 31.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.439
It says, Israel also saw the great power that Jehovah wielded against the Egyptians, and

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:51.680
the people began to fear Jehovah and to put faith in Jehovah.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.920
So that miracle inspired faith in the Israelites.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.359
Now they were the only ones who were impressed by that miracle.

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:03.760
That's fast forward, 40 years.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.520
Two spies enter Jericho and go to the house of rehab, the prostitute, and she says to

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:15.400
them, we heard how Jehovah dried up the waters of the Red Sea.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.840
When we heard about it, we lost heart.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.800
But Jehovah, your God is God in the heavens above, and earth and the earth beneath.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.840
Just hearing about that miracle inspired faith in rehab.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.520
Now another person whose faith was strengthened by a powerful work might surprise you, the

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.000
queen of Shiba.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.199
Well, the queen of Shiba, what was the powerful work?

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:45.000
Outstanding wisdom.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.520
Queen heard about the wisdom of Solomon, and her curiosity got the better of her.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:57.599
She just had to see if the report was true, and that involved a 1,200-mile trip from

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.639
her country to Jerusalem.

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:04.719
The trip turned out to be well worth the effort.

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:09.800
At the end of the visit, the queen of Shiba sent to Solomon, made Jehovah your God be

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.120
praised, who has taken pleasure in you by putting you on the throne of Israel.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.520
She gave credit to Jehovah for what she saw.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.800
Now we don't know if she ever became a worshiper of Jehovah, but Jesus said that she'd rise

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.919
up in the judgment and condemn those Jews who wouldn't even cross the street to listen

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.319
to the Son of God.

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:39.400
Well those who just two examples, and as you know, there are many more in the Bible.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.280
The Apostle Paul lists some of them, and Hebrews chapter 11, and we're going to read

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.840
verses 32 to 34.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:57.099
Hebrews chapter 11, I'll give you a moment, verses 32 to 34, and I'm going to read verse

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.840
32 first.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.759
Hebrews 11, 32, did you got it?

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:08.840
What more will I say?

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:17.560
Your time will fail me if I go on to relate about Gideon, Beirak, Samson, Jeff the David,

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.319
as well as Samuel and the other prophets.

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:29.439
Now as I read verses 33 and 34, I want you children to look at the events that are being

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:39.360
described and see if you can guess who was involved, who was the object of this miracle.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:46.319
So let's read verse 33, it says, through faith, they defended kingdoms, brought about

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:56.279
righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the force of fire,

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:59.120
escaped the edge of the sword.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:05.639
From a weak state were made powerful, became mighty and war, routed invading armies.

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:13.319
Now let's go back and see if we can identify individuals who were involved in those miracles.

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:15.639
How about defeated kingdoms?

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:18.399
Did you come up with someone?

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:19.720
Let's talk about Gideon.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.040
Now we like Gideon, he reminds us of us.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.399
He wasn't exactly brimming with confidence.

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:31.879
When an angel approached him and indicated that Jehovah had worked for him to do, Gideon

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:38.800
said, my clan is the least emanasa, and I am the most insignificant in my father's

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.920
house.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:46.759
He said something else, something that has a bearing on the theme of our discussion.

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:53.399
He said to the angel, if Jehovah is with us, where are all his wonderful acts that our

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:55.399
father's related to us?

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:56.399
Yes!

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:59.199
Where were the powerful works?

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:04.040
Before he was going to stick his neck out, Gideon wanted some kind of reassurance that

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.759
he had Jehovah's blessing.

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:08.160
What to do?

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.240
What was the angel going to do?

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:17.720
He performed a powerful work, and that inspired faith in Gideon.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:23.360
Later, Gideon's confidence was further boosted by three other remarkable signs, two

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.480
involving a fleece, and another involving a God-given dream.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:36.319
Now, with those powerful works in mind and with Jehovah's help, Gideon did the impossible.

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:42.160
With 300 men, he defeated an army of 135,000.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.079
Well, now what's they take away?

00:06:45.079 --> 00:06:47.279
What's the lesson for us?

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:53.199
With Jehovah on our side, we are never outnumbered.

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:55.240
Let's go back to verse 33.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.240
Now you children, I'm sure you're going to get this next one.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.879
Verse 33 stopped the mouths of lions.

00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:04.879
Who did that?

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:10.319
Well, it was the same one who helped Gideon defeat the Midianites.

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:11.319
It was Jehovah.

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:13.120
Well, what was the circumstance?

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.839
Well, you know, it was when Daniel was thrown into the lion's pit.

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:23.160
Now, when Daniel was condemned to die, he didn't know for sure that Jehovah was going

00:07:23.519 --> 00:07:28.759
to rescue him, but he knew that Jehovah would do the right thing.

00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:33.519
He could have that confidence because Jehovah had been with him throughout his life.

00:07:33.519 --> 00:07:37.519
Daniel had been condemned to die once before.

00:07:37.519 --> 00:07:42.019
No, wait a minute, let's think about that.

00:07:42.019 --> 00:07:46.899
Daniel had been condemned to die once before.

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:47.899
When was that?

00:07:47.899 --> 00:07:53.300
Well, it was when the king of Babylon had a dream, and he decreed that unless Daniel and

00:07:53.379 --> 00:07:58.339
the other wise men of Babylon could tell him what he dreamed and then relate the meaning

00:07:58.339 --> 00:08:02.379
of the dream, they would all be put to death.

00:08:02.379 --> 00:08:05.459
That called for a powerful work.

00:08:05.459 --> 00:08:12.459
Jehovah provided Daniel with the information he needed, and Daniel's life was saved.

00:08:12.459 --> 00:08:14.620
Well, that was Babylon.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:22.019
Now we're in Persia, and Daniel is once more facing death, death by lion.

00:08:22.139 --> 00:08:25.420
Once again, Jehovah comes to the rescue.

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:29.980
He temporarily shuts the mouths of those lions.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:34.460
Well, we're going to imagine what effect that had on Daniel, but what about us today?

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:35.460
What's the takeaway?

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.940
What's the lesson?

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:45.419
Today, Satan is walking about like a roaring lion seeking to devour someone.

00:08:45.419 --> 00:08:50.700
We may never know how often Jehovah shuts the mouth of that lion, how often Jehovah

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:55.019
protects his people as a group from Satan.

00:08:55.019 --> 00:09:00.220
When we're working from door to door, for example, it's dangerous out there, and we probably

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:05.340
have no idea how busy the angels are in our behalf.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:10.539
And if someone does lose his life while in Jehovah's service or at a meeting, and it has

00:09:10.539 --> 00:09:15.220
happened, his loved ones can be sure of two things.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:21.299
First of all, their loved one did not lose Jehovah's approval.

00:09:21.299 --> 00:09:25.100
And second, the loss is only temporary.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.539
Satan can never do us any lasting harm.

00:09:28.539 --> 00:09:34.340
And one day, Jehovah will shut that lion's mouth permanently.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.940
Now, back to Hebrews 11.

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:41.419
And this time, we're reading verse 34, and I'm sure your kids are going to guess this

00:09:41.419 --> 00:09:47.860
one, verse 34, quenched the force of fire.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:52.620
Of course, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:56.700
There were court officials in Babylon, and you'll recall it one day, King Nebuchadnezzar

00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:01.940
made a huge image of gold, and demanded that everybody worship it.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:06.779
Anyone who refused would be thrown into the burning fiery furnace.

00:10:07.779 --> 00:10:12.379
Well, that was a time to remember Jehovah's power for works in the past.

00:10:12.379 --> 00:10:17.940
And the three men had experienced that probably when they were just teenagers.

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:20.460
Can you think of how?

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:25.220
When they arrived in Babylon, they were taken to the palace for a special training, and

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:28.220
they were told to eat whatever was put in front of them.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:33.100
In this case, some of the food was prohibited under the Mosaic law.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:38.980
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refused to eat those foods, and they asked to be given

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:42.379
vegetables and water instead.

00:10:42.379 --> 00:10:46.980
Now for some of you children, just the thought of having to eat vegetables all the time

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.659
is probably quite a test.

00:10:49.659 --> 00:10:52.620
But now, think of the results of this diet.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:57.659
After only 10 days, the three young men were in much better health than those who had

00:10:57.659 --> 00:10:59.179
followed the King's diet.

00:10:59.779 --> 00:11:03.659
Now if you've ever had to follow a diet, you know that there's no way that you can

00:11:03.659 --> 00:11:06.659
show improvement in just 10 days.

00:11:06.659 --> 00:11:10.940
Jehovah had to have been involved.

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:14.220
Now they were facing death.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.139
They knew their God.

00:11:16.139 --> 00:11:18.580
They knew what he was capable of.

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:22.659
They told the King that if it was the will of God, they would be rescued.

00:11:22.659 --> 00:11:27.980
But if not, they still wouldn't worship the image of gold.

00:11:28.059 --> 00:11:35.259
They knew that if Jehovah chose not to intervene miraculously, it was not a sign of his

00:11:35.259 --> 00:11:36.580
disapproval.

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:39.500
Well, you know what happened.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.620
They were thrown into the fiery furnace.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.500
But God sent His angel to protect them.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:51.899
And when they stepped out of the furnace, there wasn't even the smell of fire on them.

00:11:51.899 --> 00:11:55.059
Their integrity also resulted in a great witness.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:58.539
When the King saw that they were alive and well, he praised Jehovah.

00:11:58.539 --> 00:12:02.899
He said, Praise be the God of Shade Rack, Meshach and Abednego.

00:12:02.899 --> 00:12:08.179
There is no other God who was able to rescue like this one.

00:12:08.179 --> 00:12:11.379
What a witness that does.

00:12:11.379 --> 00:12:14.220
Well that's what happened back then.

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:15.299
What's the takeaway?

00:12:15.299 --> 00:12:16.820
What's the lesson?

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:22.460
Today, many brothers are facing the heat of adversity.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:24.460
Russia, for example.

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:29.659
Many brothers have been given long prison sentences because they won't bow down to the

00:12:29.659 --> 00:12:30.659
state.

00:12:30.659 --> 00:12:34.419
Now, Jehovah doesn't prevent this from happening.

00:12:34.419 --> 00:12:39.419
Any more than he prevented Shade Rack, Meshach and Abednego from being thrown into the furnace.

00:12:39.419 --> 00:12:42.259
But he does help them.

00:12:42.259 --> 00:12:45.299
What do we notice about them as they're being led off to prison?

00:12:45.299 --> 00:12:46.899
They're smiling.

00:12:46.899 --> 00:12:48.899
They're serene.

00:12:48.899 --> 00:12:50.779
They're at peace.

00:12:50.779 --> 00:12:52.299
They know their God.

00:12:52.299 --> 00:12:57.019
And when they come out, there won't even be the smell of fire on them.

00:12:57.019 --> 00:13:00.019
Their faith will be intact.

00:13:00.019 --> 00:13:04.740
Their fine conduct also results in a good witness to the jailers and others who hear about

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:06.100
the persecution.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:10.340
We'll take one more example in verse 34.

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:13.980
Escaped the edge of the sword.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:16.299
I was thinking of Elisha.

00:13:16.299 --> 00:13:21.940
Now in the days of the Prophet Elisha, the King of Syria went to war against Israel and

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:27.580
he called a war council, and the Syrians sequently planned this strategy.

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:32.659
But Jehovah kept telling Elisha what the Syrians were up to, and Elisha kept telling the

00:13:32.659 --> 00:13:35.019
King of Israel.

00:13:35.019 --> 00:13:41.779
The Syrians were furious, and the King sent a large army to capture Elisha.

00:13:41.779 --> 00:13:43.940
What in gratitude?

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.860
Why do we say that?

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:50.220
Because in the previous chapter, we read that Elisha had cured the leprosy of Naman,

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:57.059
a chief of the Syrian army, and now a large Syrian army was hunting Elisha down.

00:13:57.059 --> 00:14:00.580
We hope Naman wasn't among them.

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:06.620
Finally, the Syrians found the city where Elisha was, and he surrounded it.

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:11.500
Elisha's attendant was scared to death, but Elisha wasn't afraid.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:17.299
Second King's chapter 6 verses 16 and 17 explains why.

00:14:17.299 --> 00:14:18.299
This is encouraging.

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:20.100
Let's look it up.

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:26.299
Second King's chapter 6 verses 16 and 17.

00:14:26.299 --> 00:14:30.059
Now this is Elisha talking to his attendant.

00:14:30.059 --> 00:14:37.379
Do not be afraid, for there are more who are with us than those who are with them.

00:14:37.379 --> 00:14:45.379
Then Elisha began to pray and say, O Jehovah, open his eyes, please, that he may see.

00:14:45.379 --> 00:14:49.740
Immediately, Jehovah opened the attendant's eyes and he saw.

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:56.700
And look, the mountainous region was full of horses and more chariots of fire all around

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:57.700
Elisha.

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:05.460
Well, that was a miraculous occurrence that was faith strengthening indeed.

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:06.460
What's the takeaway?

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:08.500
What's the lesson for us?

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:14.580
Well, one day, will we face with hosts of modern day Syrians?

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:19.059
And what's going to help us to remain calm, unafraid?

00:15:19.059 --> 00:15:25.100
We'll look heavenward, and with our eyes of faith, we'll see millions of angels and

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.580
count all around us.

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:35.740
We know that Jehovah will do the right thing, whatever is in harmony with his will.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:42.100
I hear you say, I'd like to see a miracle that'd help a lot to strengthen my faith.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.740
We see miracles every day.

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:46.539
What's a miracle?

00:15:46.539 --> 00:15:51.620
It's a powerful work that can't be explained in human terms.

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.620
Modern example of that is prayer.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.860
Isn't prayer amazing?

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:58.779
Can you explain it?

00:15:58.779 --> 00:16:03.580
Jehovah can listen to millions of prayers in any language all at once.

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:06.100
That's a miracle.

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:09.059
But how does prayer build our faith?

00:16:09.059 --> 00:16:14.700
When we pray about a problem that nobody but Jehovah knows about and our prayer is answered,

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.340
our faith is strengthened.

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:20.299
Now that is powerful.

00:16:20.299 --> 00:16:24.659
And what about all the experiences we hear where someone desperately prayed to God?

00:16:24.659 --> 00:16:29.100
If you exist, please send someone to teach me about you.

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:35.299
And ten minutes later, a witness knocks on the door.

00:16:35.299 --> 00:16:39.500
Coincidence or miracle?

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:42.740
Another miracle, our Christian brotherhood.

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.259
Isn't it remarkable?

00:16:44.259 --> 00:16:46.059
You can explain it.

00:16:46.059 --> 00:16:48.899
Former enemies become fast friends.

00:16:48.899 --> 00:16:52.580
You can go to a kingdom hall anywhere in the world and you'll find your brothers and

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:53.580
sisters.

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.700
They'll be glad to see you.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.179
You'll feel at ease.

00:16:57.179 --> 00:17:01.539
You know what they believe and what they'll be studying at the meetings.

00:17:01.539 --> 00:17:06.220
You'll see and feel the love.

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:11.519
In times of ethnic cleansing, how often do we read of brothers and sisters who risk their

00:17:11.519 --> 00:17:16.799
lives to hide fellow believers who happen to be from another tribe?

00:17:16.799 --> 00:17:22.519
You know, when I think of a loving brotherhood, I always think of the experience Jack Johansson

00:17:22.519 --> 00:17:25.519
related in his life story.

00:17:25.519 --> 00:17:28.480
Brother Johansson was a missionary serving in Malawi.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:35.480
At a time when the country was experienced in a tremendous political unrest and violence.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:39.960
Now he and a young African brother set out to check on the welfare of witnesses in another

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.279
part of the country.

00:17:42.279 --> 00:17:46.720
But along the way, they encountered a soldier who wasn't friendly.

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:51.960
He said to the African brother, I have to shoot the white man.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.799
He was serious.

00:17:53.799 --> 00:17:58.960
As he raised his gun to fire, the young African brother thrust himself between the gunman

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:03.160
and brother Johansson and said, shoot me, shoot me instead.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:08.839
Well, that soldier was so touched by the love of our young African brother that he put

00:18:08.839 --> 00:18:10.839
his gun down.

00:18:10.839 --> 00:18:17.599
When you hear experiences like that, it makes you proud to be part of Johovas' organization.

00:18:17.599 --> 00:18:21.720
And why is it that Johovas is gathering us into an organization?

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:27.519
There's an interesting detail recorded at Isaiah 43 and verse 10.

00:18:27.519 --> 00:18:28.920
I'd like you to look it up.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:33.160
Now when you hear Isaiah 43 and 10, you say, I know that.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.799
It's about you who are my witnesses, says Johovas.

00:18:35.799 --> 00:18:39.440
And that's true, but we're going to focus on another part of the verse.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:48.039
So Isaiah 43 and verse 10, you are my witnesses, declares Johovas, yes, my servant, whom I

00:18:48.039 --> 00:18:57.480
have chosen, now notice this, so that you may know and have faith in me.

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:02.279
Before we can have faith in Johovas, we have to get to know him.

00:19:02.279 --> 00:19:04.880
We have to learn about his powerful works.

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:10.220
His past and those present, and as we study his dealings with his people in the past,

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:14.400
we see that Johovas always keeps his promises.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:18.279
He's promised to bring about a righteous new world, and we could take that promise to

00:19:18.279 --> 00:19:19.960
the bank.

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:26.240
And through prayer and association with his organization, we can experience the modern-day

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:31.440
miracles that Johovas is performing.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:35.599
The more we know about Johovas, the more we'll love him.

00:19:35.599 --> 00:19:40.000
The more we love him, the more we'll want to tell others about him.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.880
The more we preach, the stronger our faith will become.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:47.359
And we will be made powerful by faith.
