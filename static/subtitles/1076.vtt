00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.969
Pressure from the world can erode our determination to do what is right, at times even a mature

00:00:06.969 --> 00:00:11.210
Christian may be inclined to do what is bad.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.250
Please find Romans 7, 21 through 23.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:21.649
The Apostle Paul was certainly a mature, but notice what he said of himself as we read

00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:27.059
Romans 7, 21 through 23.

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:34.179
I find then this law, in my case, when I wish to do what is right, what is bad is present

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:35.500
with me.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.659
I really delight in the law of God according to the man I am within, but I see in my body

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:48.740
another law warring against the law of my mind and leading me captive to sin's law

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.520
that is in my body.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:59.920
Like Paul, we might find that we have a war or a struggle inside us as we fight against

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.399
the law of sin.

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:09.760
I ever like Paul, we know that for us to please Jehovah, we must live in harmony with his

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.120
standards.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.280
Look at 1 Corinthians 6, 9 and 10.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.200
What are some of Jehovah's moral standards?

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.959
Notice the list of moral issues that we choose not to succumb to.

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:36.329
At 1 Corinthians 6, 9 and 10, it says, or do you not know that unrighteous people will

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.930
not inherit God's kingdom, do not be misled?

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:48.849
Those who are sexually immoral, idolaters of delters, men who submit to homosexual acts,

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:57.290
men who practice homosexuality, thieves, greedy people, truckers, revilers, and extortioners

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.530
will not inherit God's kingdom.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:09.849
We must be firmly convinced that these moral standards of Jehovah are right and beneficial.

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.969
Why can we have faith in these standards?

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:17.409
To find out, find the Isaiah 48 to 17.

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:26.770
Here you will see we can have faith in God's standards because they always benefit us.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:34.810
Isaiah 48, 17 says, this is what Jehovah says, your repurchaser, the holy one of Israel,

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:42.169
I Jehovah am your God, the one teaching you to benefit yourself, the one guiding you in

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:45.849
the way you should walk.

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:53.050
When you see the point, Jehovah is teaching us to benefit ourselves.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.009
We can have faith in his standards of right and wrong.

00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:06.770
They are unchanging and they produce good results under all circumstances and in all cultures.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.050
Consider God's standard for marriage.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:17.490
Jehovah created marriage as a permanent, loving union between a man and a woman.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:25.009
Jehovah gave Adam and wife, Eve, not Eve and B and D, just Eve.

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:30.930
He told them, be fruitful and become many, feel the earth.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.129
Let's look at 1 Corinthians 6, 18.

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:42.050
It is making the point that sex outside of marriage is prohibited by Jehovah.

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.770
1 Corinthians 6, 18 says, free from sexual immorality.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.289
Every other sin that a man may commit is outside his body.

00:03:52.289 --> 00:04:01.780
But whoever practices sexual immorality is sending against his own body.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:08.139
When family members followed Jehovah's standards, the family is secure, stable and happy.

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:16.259
In the following video, note how a couple benefited from applying God's moral standards.

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:21.199
We met at a party when I was in the military.

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:27.279
I was on the dance floor and I saw Frinchie and I was like, oh, I'm going to talk to this

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:30.649
girl right here.

00:04:30.649 --> 00:04:33.290
The whole time we were just smiling at each other.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.730
This instant attraction, it was mutual.

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:46.089
Gradually, we were living together and a few months go by and things are going well.

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:53.079
And then I find out I'm pregnant and he left.

00:04:53.079 --> 00:05:00.019
I was shocked though I shouldn't have been, but I was shocked.

00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:05.579
And truthfully, I was scared like, what am I going to do now?

00:05:05.579 --> 00:05:15.600
I felt like a failure and I kept asking myself, how did I let this happen?

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.360
I knew that I had to be there and I wanted to be there.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.680
I just didn't know how.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.519
We prayed together for the first time as a couple.

00:05:26.519 --> 00:05:33.439
That was a Friday night, Saturday morning, we had a knock on the door.

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:36.240
We decided to have a Bible study.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.240
They had to study the chapter on family life and marriage.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:50.079
At that moment, I knew that I wanted to have our relationship be honorable before Jehovah.

00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:55.040
You learned that Jehovah meant for marriages to be a permanent bond.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:03.839
The insecurities of every disagreement, ending in a breakup or divorce, all of that went

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:05.160
away.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:11.439
We started to see Jehovah's training in practical ways.

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:21.120
Just learning how to be a husband who respected and cared for his wife.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.439
We became partners, a team, a compliment.

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:30.720
And that was only because Jehovah taught us how to do it.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:37.399
Though it was difficult at the outset, we made that decision to dedicate our life to

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:43.529
do Jehovah's will and we got baptized together.

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:50.290
We've been married 25 years and the insecurities are gone.

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:57.009
I focus on all the blessings that have come, just for keeping Jehovah in our life.

00:06:57.009 --> 00:07:06.100
And that's the best feeling in the world.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:12.500
You can go out on your own, but you'll never find the joy, you'll never find the peace,

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:21.660
you'll never find the security that comes from doing it Jehovah's way.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:26.899
It was only after coming to know Jehovah and having faith in his standards that the

00:07:26.899 --> 00:07:34.819
couple came to have a stable and enduring marriage of 25 years.

00:07:34.819 --> 00:07:36.540
What about us?

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:41.579
How can we strengthen our faith in God's moral standards?

00:07:41.579 --> 00:07:49.259
Contemplate the benefits of obeying God's moral standards and the consequences of disobeying

00:07:49.259 --> 00:07:51.620
them.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:08:00.379
No two Bible principles, Deuteronomy 3229 says, be wise, ponder over this.

00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:02.660
Think about the outcome.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:09.180
In other words, contemplate the benefits of obeying God's moral standards.

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:17.579
In contrast, the consequences of disobeying God's moral standards can be severe.

00:08:17.579 --> 00:08:29.980
Deuteronomy 6.7 and 8 says, so with a view to his flesh and rep corruption from the flesh.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:34.500
The world's entertainment industry often ignores this fact.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:42.100
Your faith in God's standards will grow as you experience the benefits of living by them.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:49.779
obeying God's moral standards protects us physically, emotionally and spiritually.

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:59.779
Jehovah's standards make us wise so that we do not have to learn from painful experiences

00:08:59.779 --> 00:09:02.299
to illustrate.

00:09:02.299 --> 00:09:04.860
You're driving and you see a sign.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:11.539
It says school speed limit 15 miles an hour.

00:09:11.539 --> 00:09:18.340
But if you did not adhere to that standard of law, suppose you are driving at 50 miles

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:22.139
an hour, you hit a child crossing the road.

00:09:22.139 --> 00:09:26.220
The consequence for not obeying the standard?

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:30.820
That would be an extremely painful experience.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:37.389
Jehovah's standards protect us from the pain.

00:09:37.389 --> 00:09:41.830
This concludes by sharing some verses from Psalm 19.

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.549
Please turn there.

00:09:44.549 --> 00:09:50.990
This Psalm is speaking about Jehovah's standards, his laws, and reminders.

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:55.830
We will first read Psalm 19.7.

00:09:55.830 --> 00:10:01.669
The law of Jehovah is perfect, restoring strength.

00:10:01.669 --> 00:10:10.429
The reminder of Jehovah is trustworthy, making the inexperienced one wise.

00:10:10.429 --> 00:10:14.830
We do not need to remain naive and inexperienced.

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:17.350
We become wise.

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:21.590
Now read with me verses 8 and 9.

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:27.190
The orders from Jehovah are righteous, causing the heart to rejoice.

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:33.149
The commandment of Jehovah is clean, making the eyes shine.

00:10:33.149 --> 00:10:37.990
The fear of Jehovah is pure, lasting forever.

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:44.669
The judgments of Jehovah are true, altogether righteous.

00:10:44.669 --> 00:10:48.950
Living by God's standards brings approval from Jehovah.

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:55.029
We enjoy a clean conscience and a good relationship with Him.

00:10:55.029 --> 00:10:58.230
Verse 11.

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:07.230
By then your servant has been warned in keeping them there is a large reward.

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:11.950
It says a large reward awaits us.

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:19.830
Half faith in God's moral standards obey them and become wise.

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:25.750
They will protect you physically, emotionally, and spiritually.

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:30.549
You will have a clean conscience and Jehovah's approval.

00:11:30.549 --> 00:11:36.539
And in the end, ever last in life.

00:11:36.539 --> 00:11:43.220
Brother Garrett Loesch of the governing body will now present the final talk of this symposium.

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:47.019
Why we have faith in God's love.
