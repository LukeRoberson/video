WEBVTT

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:10.119
But as stated earlier, we provide help in many other ways by means of our voluntary donations.

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:14.519
The primary focus, though, is helping people spiritually.

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.800
In contrast to Jova's organization, many publishing companies do not provide literature for

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.800
the blind.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.800
Why?

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.760
Well, they've determined that it has not cost effective.

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.840
However, Jova wants everyone to have a hope for the future.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:46.600
Notice how our organization works hard to make the truth more readily available for those who are blind.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.359
I can't wait to see birds.

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:56.280
I can't wait to see their little beaks chirp when I hear the sound of them.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.759
I was fully sighted until I was nine and then gradually started losing my sight.

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:04.000
When I was young, I loved skiing.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.840
I skied and enjoyed the outdoors.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.680
We're really very busy in our life.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.599
We have my mother, who's 85 and my aunt, who's 92, that live here also.

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:21.319
So we have their lives to work around doctors and meals.

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:29.719
We have our Theocratic life and we have our studies, our field service, our personal study.

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:32.560
I lead a very, very full life.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.560
I just happen to be blind.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.400
In my early 30s, I lost the use of my right eye.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.359
It was quite sudden and I went to the doctor and following the examination, he took me into

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:53.840
his office and let me know that I would be blind in both eyes and it's immediate response

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.359
by me was fear.

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:03.959
But it was the ministry that gave me the greatest strength and confidence to go forward.

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:08.560
Throughout the United States branch territory, there are about 20 million persons that are

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.800
either blind or suffer from low vision.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.919
And in response to that, the organization has produced braille literature in a number

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:24.520
of languages, also audio files, as well as electronic screen reader files.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:31.120
Our principal function is to transcribe publications into braille.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:38.439
The transcription is done electronically by a program that has been produced in-house

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:42.080
and is part of the watch tower translation system.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.479
We produce braille files that can be embossed into paper publications.

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:57.719
The screen reader and no-taker files are uploaded to the JW.org website for use by blind

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:00.879
and visually impaired persons.

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:09.439
Not being able to read and having to learn to get the spiritual truths in in a different

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:12.360
way is quite a challenge.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:19.919
That's where the audio recordings being able to hear, I am able to do exactly what I

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:21.199
used to.

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:28.719
First Corinthians 9.22 says, I have become all things to people of all sorts that I might

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:33.439
by all possible means save some.

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:36.159
And we've taken those words to heart.

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:40.800
We want persons outside of our organization to benefit from the literature that we are

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.599
producing for the blind.

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:48.199
Now, after attending an expo for the blind, Janet recognized the vast potential that exists

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:50.719
in the blind community for the good news.

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:56.159
The amount of blind people at the expo, it was astounding.

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:01.919
In the first thing that we thought of was, these people need Jehovah.

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:07.000
And immediately, we came home and we called Bethel and told them what we saw.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:14.599
We appointed a sign language circuit officer to organize our participation at the event.

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:20.639
And this was also beneficial because some persons who attended are both blind and deaf, thus

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.160
could only benefit from tactile sign language.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.879
We got together the week before and discussed how we were going to set up a table in the

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:30.879
booth.

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:34.439
Some blind people prefer braille and others prefer audio.

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:37.800
So we had to have both available for them.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.759
Anything that would attract those who are blind.

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:45.500
So they would come up to the table, they could feel the braille, literature, they could

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:51.959
feel the visual aids, they could listen to a scripture about God's hope for the future.

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:57.279
So everything was tailored to those who are blind or visually impaired.

00:04:57.279 --> 00:05:03.199
Our participation at these expos has been tremendously successful.

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:08.959
Many times, these individuals that are present are learning the truth for the first time.

00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:15.879
61% of the people that we talked to gave us their contact information.

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:17.560
Everyone was very appreciative.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.360
They all enjoyed what we had to show them and teach them.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:30.360
Many of them left the booth with multiple pieces of literature.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.839
Some of those who approached the booth were so appreciative, they gave us hugs, they

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:41.860
saw them sat down right then there to have their first study.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.699
It was a very special experience and it felt like we were opening a new form of ministry.

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:51.259
It felt like we were contacting a group of people that hadn't had the opportunity to

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:53.060
know each other before.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.019
They can see the truth, they can see the ring of truth in their minds eyes.

00:05:58.019 --> 00:06:03.769
So many people thank us for being there.

00:06:03.769 --> 00:06:08.370
This ministry is really unbelievable.

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.329
It's unlike anything I've done in my life.
