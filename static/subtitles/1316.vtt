WEBVTT

00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:09.230
Before thousands of delegates can be invited to a large convention, there is a significant amount of work that needs to take place.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.230
We joined some of the volunteers behind the scenes.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:22.050
About a year and a half ago the branch called and invited me to help out with the international conventions.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.050
February of 2013, we were invited to work in Rooming and it was confidential. We couldn't even tell our wives what we were doing.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:35.049
We came from North Little Rock, Arkansas, where it was a Buckingham, Pennsylvania, the assembly hall here, to construct these stages.

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:40.049
We're going to go to each of the conventions and assist the brothers to put these together on the fields there.

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:44.049
I serve on the hospitality committee. I've been involved in this project for over a year now.

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:54.049
An event of this size takes a lot of organization and we haven't had a convention in Seattle really for decades.

00:00:54.049 --> 00:01:01.049
So it went into educating the friends so that they are enthused as we are to support the effort.

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:07.049
When we all first got the assignment, we didn't know what we had in front of us, which might have been a blessing at the time.

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.049
But we knew that Jehovah would step in.

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:16.049
Our whole life revolves around theocratic service. We always look for the opportunities to serve Jehovah and our brothers no matter what it is really.

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.049
It was a bit overwhelming to say the least. The initial request was to have 500 people here every single day.

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:29.049
All the congregations were given questionnaires, the friends to fill out. We had over 3,000 individuals from the Seattle area fill those out.

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:36.049
We pray that Jehovah is always to be used. We have a willing spirit and we want to be used in any capacity that we can.

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:42.049
And to be asked to be here to take part in this is a great privilege.

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.049
Why did I want to be part of this?

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:52.049
Well, the question to me should be why not be part of it. I mean, it's exciting, it's for Jehovah, it's people.

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.049
So there is no way I would have let that pass.

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.049
What I do, I serve Jehovah and anything Jehovah asks, we try to do.

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:07.049
Out of the group that we've asked to assist in all these different trades, there's quite a few trades represented.

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.050
None of them said they were unavailable or could not make room for it.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.050
The volunteer spirit here has been just incredible.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.050
The letter we sent out that described the activities, let them clearly know that all they'd be doing is coming here, greeting the friends and leaving.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.050
They'd be here maybe an hour and that didn't deter a single person.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:36.050
I enjoy volunteering because it allows me an opportunity to show my appreciation to the organization, to Jehovah.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.050
It gives me opportunities to demonstrate my love for the brotherhood.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:49.050
I'm professionally for my business and so I just decided to make it a priority and this Jehovah was my top client.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:59.050
I really wanted the opportunity to come and sing for people that came from Portugal and Spain to make them happy.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.050
Many times I thought, I just don't know how this is going to work.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:10.050
We didn't know whether we would have enough, even for one cast, for one evening program and we had 14 to put on.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.050
Yes, we need to get each cast over 100 acts.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:20.050
Every couple of months we would have a video conference with the branch, which is really nice to see those brothers face to face, get to know them.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.050
The assignment of this magnitude can be physically draining because you're busy, you're worried.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.050
They took the time to give us some of their time, their attention to provide us with the direction that we needed.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:39.050
We would oftentimes ask a lot of questions, they didn't have the answers, which made us feel better because they had to go to maybe their oversight, to the teaching committee,

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.050
to the branch committee to find some of the answers.

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.050
So we all felt we were kind of in it together, trying to make this work together.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:04:00.050
In those times of discouragement, it never failed that an email would show up or a card, thanking myself and my family for what we're doing and the other brothers and always an expression of their thoughts and prayers on our behalf.

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.050
Boy, that just energized you, you're ready to go again.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.050
The friends responded admirably, it was amazing.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.050
The first day we had 500, we'd be hitting that quota.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:14.050
So it was great to see the entire parking lot full with smiling faces and signs and people screaming and yelling to the delegates.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.050
It was a wonderful sight.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.050
It's completely Jehovah's Hand, it's pretty cool.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.050
I am serving as one of the 800 volunteers here.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:24.050
I'm serving as a waitress.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:33.050
I came here today to welcome my brothers and sisters from Russia, from just all different parts of the world.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.050
I don't know them, but I know I love them. They're my brothers.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.050
And I tell you what, when I went to their countries as a kid, they showed me the same love.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.050
And so I'm happy to give it back to them.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:52.379
We've spent a lot of hours, and as I know myself, I've spent 180 in March.

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:57.379
And I'm about 120 this month, but still getting out in the ministry.

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:04.379
There was one brother who asked my age, he was from Japan, and he said his mother had died.

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:06.379
He said, you will be my mother.

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:11.379
And that was just so dear to me, and I just hugged, and we hugged each other.

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:19.379
Friends are excited, they're willing to volunteer, they're donating their time, their resources, everything.

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:25.379
I think the benefit is that it invigorates some spiritually, and it invigorates them to do more in Jehovah's Service.

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:31.379
Even though we were behind the scenes in doing the work, and though some I think it's a thankless job,

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:37.379
just knowing that we did all for Jehovah and our brothers, and how they were able to enjoy it makes it whole worth it.

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:45.379
Volunteering to be a greeter has really strengthened my faith as one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:51.379
We're doing this for our brothers and sisters, but I think we're getting way more out of it than we feel like they're going to get.

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:53.379
100%, I would do it again.

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:59.379
Without a doubt, if we were asked tomorrow to start another project on this stuff, we would start at no problem.

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:04.399
It makes that it's been a life-changing experience.

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:07.399
I just enjoy it, thank you.
