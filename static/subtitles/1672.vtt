00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:08.419
Over 1 million menonites, who speak low German, live in communities around the world and countries like Russia,

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:11.419
Paraguay, and Canada.

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:17.420
We are going to meet Wilhelm Kanalsen, who grew up in a menonite community in Chihuahua, Mexico,

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:25.390
and find out what moved him to learn Bible truth.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.390
I was born 1993 into a menonite family.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:38.390
And from childhood on, I learned that God created us to suffer, to work the fields, and to try to be worthy to go to heaven.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.390
But from infancy, I decided to do what God wanted for me.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.390
I wanted him to be pleased with me. That was the desire of my heart.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:57.390
Years back, I started to get the feeling that the memorized prayers I would recite from my German prayer book just weren't enough.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.390
They were not the prayers that I felt in my heart.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.390
Didn't even understand them.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.390
I wanted to tell God how I really felt, and that's what I did.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.700
All of a sudden, I couldn't resist praying in my own language.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.700
I told God everything. I opened my heart to Him.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.700
One thing I asked for was that He might help my family so that we could do the right thing and be safe.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.700
When I finished, I felt much calmer, and from then on, I always prayed that way.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:41.700
Later, my mother bought a Bible in our language, and that just happened to be when Jehovah's Witnesses started to visit us.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.700
Jehovah heard my prayer.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.700
They came on a regular basis, and it was so remarkable.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.700
We were amazed how they answered all our questions in our own language and with our own Bible.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.700
It impressed me very much.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.840
Then, when I was a teenager, I finished school.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.840
Soon afterwards, I started working at the job that was three and a half hours away from home.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.840
At the same time, I started to go out like the other young people, looking for a girlfriend and drinking.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:25.939
But later, my conscience tormented me.

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:30.939
My family was taking the Bible study very seriously, but I didn't.

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:33.939
But suddenly things changed.

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:38.939
In January 2010, our family attended a district convention.

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:41.939
And that was very special for me.

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.939
It was so different from what I was used to.

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:50.939
The brothers came and welcomed me and treated me so kindly.

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:52.939
It was just amazing.

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:54.939
I could hardly believe it.

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:58.939
And the music they had, that was what touched my heart.

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:00.939
I liked it so much.

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:04.939
That was something I never forgot in all my life.

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:09.939
In July 2010, I started to regularly attend the meetings as well.

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:13.939
Then a brother asked me if I would like to study the Bible with him.

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:16.939
Using the book, what does the Bible really teach?

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:21.939
I then realized I had to do more if I wanted to please God.

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:27.939
It would have been good to attend every meeting, but since I worked far away, I could not.

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:30.939
I could only attend the meetings on Sundays.

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:35.939
So I decided to ask my boss if he could give me a different job, but that didn't work.

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:38.939
He didn't want to make the change.

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:41.939
So I waited for a little while.

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:44.939
I thought I would try asking again.

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:50.939
This time I asked him if I could attend the meeting in a congregation that was near my work.

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:53.939
But he didn't want to let me do that either.

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:55.939
And there was something else.

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:02.939
He wanted to give me a large bonus if I would work for him until the end of the year.

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:09.939
But I thought to myself, if I go on working, what will this show regarding my decision making?

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:13.939
If Jehovah's Day comes, what do I show as more important for me?

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:15.939
Jehovah or my work?

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:17.939
And so the decision was made.

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:24.939
After I resigned my work, I brought all my things home and I felt free, relieved, ready to serve Jehovah.

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:31.939
One week after I quit my job, I was approved to preach with the congregation.

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:40.939
And what a great pleasure it was for me when 4 months later, I could dedicate myself to Jehovah and get baptized.

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:42.939
That made me so happy.

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:50.939
Soon afterwards, I was able to serve as a regular pioneer and even be appointed as a ministerial servant.

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:53.939
But Jehovah's blessing didn't stop there.

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:59.939
The privilege I now have, working as a translator on the low German translation team.

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:05.819
It's the best work I can imagine.

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:12.819
It helps more people to come to know Jehovah in their own language.

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:20.819
Not in a language they can hardly understand, so that they too can learn the truth about Jehovah God.

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:34.819
I look forward to surviving into the new work, together with my family, to work the land and contribute to making the earth a paradise.

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:40.519
Did you notice what touched Wilhelm's heart?

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:47.519
It was praying to God in the language of his heart and being able to read the Bible in his native low German.

00:05:47.519 --> 00:05:53.519
That's why we do everything we can to show people in their own language what the Bible really teaches.

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:58.519
But something else caught Wilhelm's attention at the convention he attended with his family.

00:05:58.519 --> 00:06:01.519
It was our Theocratic music.

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:07.519
We've been blessed in recent years with new songs and inspiring recordings that let us sing to Jehovah.

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:12.519
And if you play an instrument, but think playing Theocratic music would be too difficult,

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:18.519
you can download sheet music with simplified chords from the JW.org website.
