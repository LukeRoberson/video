WEBVTT

00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:06.459
Welcome to JW Broadcasting for June 2023.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.339
Over the past few years

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:30.140
because of the COVID-19 pandemic,

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.179
the Gilead classes were limited to 24 students.

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:38.340
Now, on the 80th anniversary of the school,

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.420
48 special full-time servants from around the world

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.259
were once again together in one class.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.780
On March 11th, a program of specifically crafted talks

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.539
was presented as a parting gift to the graduates.

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.380
It's our pleasure to share these talks with you.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.380
Here is part one of the 153rd Gilead graduation program.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.709
Oh, would some power the gift give us

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:14.310
to see ourselves as others see us?

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.790
It would, from many, a blunder, free us.

00:01:19.989 --> 00:01:24.469
Well, that famous quote from the Scottish poet Robert Burns

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:27.989
acknowledges that it is impossible

00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:32.230
always to see ourselves as others do.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.510
Well, that's why we need training.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.989
That's why we need advice.

00:01:36.989 --> 00:01:40.670
That's why we need counsel to help us to improve

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.950
and to work on certain flaws that perhaps we just

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.189
can't see in ourselves.

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:50.709
Well, what a wonderful opportunity.

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:54.069
You students at Gilead have had to receive

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:59.069
focused spiritual training from brothers who truly love you.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.750
And now, no doubt you've come to see yourself

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.750
more clearly than you have ever seen yourself before.

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.830
But you know, that quote from Robert Burns

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.509
can be understood in a different way, too.

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:22.110
See, maybe what we cannot see clearly in ourselves

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.150
are all of the good qualities that we possess

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.550
or the potential that we have to be used by Jehovah

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.509
in his service.

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:36.030
1 Samuel chapter 16 and verse 7 says,

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.949
Man sees what appears to the eyes,

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:43.189
but Jehovah sees into the heart.

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:45.550
Well, in seeing into your heart,

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.789
Jehovah saw fit to draw you into a dedicated relationship

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:51.909
with him.

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:56.069
And since then, he's entrusted you with various assignments

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.990
in his service.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.270
Now, why?

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.030
Why did Jehovah do that?

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.750
What does he see in you?

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:04.669
What qualities?

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:08.669
What spiritual qualifications does he observe?

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:13.310
Well, we can't know all that Jehovah sees in you

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.229
because we cannot see ourselves as Jehovah sees us.

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:21.590
That's probably why so many of God's servants

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.629
and Bible times were reluctant to accept challenging assignments.

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:31.310
Now, just think of some examples of this.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.030
People who did not see the fine qualities

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.310
in themselves that Jehovah could see.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.469
For example, take Gideon.

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:43.590
Now, in Judges chapter 6, let's look at this.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:50.020
Judges chapter 6 and verse 14,

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.460
notice what Jehovah said to Gideon.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.620
He said, Go with the strength you have

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.219
and you will save Israel out of Midian's hand.

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:03.219
Is it not I who sent you?

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:04.900
But now how did Gideon react?

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.419
Verse 15, Gideon said, pardon me, Jehovah.

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:11.900
How can I save Israel?

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.139
Look, my clan is the least in Manasseh

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:20.139
and I am the most insignificant in my father's house.

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:25.620
Well, obviously, Gideon could not see himself

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.819
as Jehovah saw him.

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:29.500
What about Moses?

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.939
In Exodus chapter 4, when Jehovah assigned him to lead,

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:36.899
Israel out of Egypt, Moses was keenly aware

00:04:36.899 --> 00:04:39.300
of all of his inadequacies.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.779
In fact, when talking with Jehovah,

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:44.899
he raised one objection after another.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.540
Well, was Jehovah aware of the inadequacies

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.540
that Moses had?

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.860
Of course, of course he was.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.259
He also knew that Moses' brother Aaron was older

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:59.019
and that he was a better speaker.

00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:05.019
But Jehovah saw in Moses qualities of faith,

00:05:05.019 --> 00:05:11.019
unselfishness and meekness, qualities that made Moses

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:14.019
the right choice for the job.

00:05:15.019 --> 00:05:17.019
What about Jeremiah?

00:05:17.019 --> 00:05:20.019
When Jehovah commissioned him to serve as a prophet,

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:21.019
do you remember what he said?

00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:22.019
Let's look at it.

00:05:22.019 --> 00:05:28.509
Jeremiah chapter 1, Jeremiah chapter 1.

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:30.509
Look at verse 6.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.509
Jeremiah says,

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:40.509
I do not know how to speak for I am just a boy.

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:42.509
Well, what did Jehovah say?

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:43.509
Oh, okay.

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:46.509
Okay, Jeremiah, see if I can find someone else.

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:49.509
No, look at verse 7.

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:51.509
Jehovah then said to me,

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:54.509
Do not say I am but a boy.

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:58.509
For you must go to all those to whom I send you

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:03.509
and you should say everything that I command you.

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:08.509
Why was Jehovah so confident that Jeremiah was the right choice

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:11.509
for this special assignment?

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:13.509
Well, of course, if you look at verse 8,

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:15.509
Jehovah says,

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:17.509
I am with you.

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:20.509
Now, of course, that's the same thing that Jehovah said to Gideon.

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:22.509
It's the same thing he said to Moses.

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:25.509
In other words, because Jehovah was with them,

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:27.509
they would be successful.

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:29.509
But there's another reason too.

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:32.509
You see what it says in verse 5?

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:34.509
Jehovah says to Jeremiah,

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:37.509
Before I formed you in the womb,

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:40.509
I knew, isn't that interesting?

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:42.509
I knew you.

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:45.509
And before you were born, I sanctified you.

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:49.509
I made you a prophet to the nations.

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:52.509
Jehovah knew Jeremiah.

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:55.509
He saw in Jeremiah certain qualities

00:06:55.509 --> 00:07:01.509
that would make him an effective prophet with Jehovah's help.

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:04.509
Well, could Jeremiah see that in himself?

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:06.509
No.

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:09.509
He just had to trust in Jehovah's assessment.

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:14.509
Move forward and do what Jehovah asked him to do.

00:07:14.509 --> 00:07:18.509
Well, we have wonderful examples of this in our modern day too.

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:23.509
Brother John Booth was a faithful, humble brother.

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:28.509
He started in full-time service in 1928.

00:07:28.509 --> 00:07:34.509
Now, in 1935, he was called to work at the factory at Bethel.

00:07:34.509 --> 00:07:37.509
But now, just after working for a few days,

00:07:37.509 --> 00:07:42.509
he was very surprised when Brother Nor invited him to go on the road

00:07:42.509 --> 00:07:44.509
as a regional service director,

00:07:44.509 --> 00:07:48.509
what we would perhaps call a circuit over here today.

00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:51.509
Brother Nor explained there was a great need

00:07:51.509 --> 00:07:57.509
and that Brother Booth could be a big help because of his experience as a pioneer.

00:07:57.509 --> 00:08:02.509
But Brother Booth replied that he had never had a position in the congregation.

00:08:02.509 --> 00:08:05.509
He had never given a talk, can you imagine?

00:08:05.509 --> 00:08:08.509
And he had no training to do so.

00:08:08.509 --> 00:08:11.509
But here's what Brother Nor said.

00:08:11.509 --> 00:08:15.509
eloquent speakers are not what is needed.

00:08:15.509 --> 00:08:18.509
Just someone who loves the service

00:08:18.509 --> 00:08:24.509
and will take the lead in it and will talk about service at the meetings.

00:08:24.509 --> 00:08:26.509
Brother Booth said,

00:08:26.509 --> 00:08:30.509
with misgivings, doubts and fears,

00:08:30.509 --> 00:08:35.509
but wanting to do Jehovah's will, I agreed to try it.

00:08:35.509 --> 00:08:37.509
Well, how did it turn out?

00:08:37.509 --> 00:08:39.509
Brother Booth moved forward.

00:08:39.509 --> 00:08:43.509
He spent his whole life in full-time service,

00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:48.509
later serving for more than 20 years as a member of the governing body.

00:08:48.509 --> 00:08:51.509
When he finished his earthly course,

00:08:51.509 --> 00:08:53.509
the watchtower stated,

00:08:53.509 --> 00:09:00.509
he was beloved for his profoundly humble and kind Christian personality.

00:09:00.509 --> 00:09:07.509
Obviously, Jehovah saw something good in Brother John Booth.

00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:10.509
Well, what do we learn from these examples?

00:09:10.509 --> 00:09:14.509
Like Gideon and Moses and Jeremiah and Brother Booth,

00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:19.509
we might feel inadequate for a certain assignment.

00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:24.509
And it's good that we're not overconfident or too self-reliant,

00:09:24.509 --> 00:09:28.509
yet we don't want to go to the other extreme either.

00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:30.509
If so, you see, we could begin to think,

00:09:30.509 --> 00:09:32.509
I could never be a pioneer.

00:09:32.509 --> 00:09:34.509
I could never be a ministerial servant.

00:09:34.509 --> 00:09:36.509
I could never be an elder.

00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:38.509
I could never be a Bethelite.

00:09:38.509 --> 00:09:43.509
I could never be a construction servant and on and on and on.

00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:47.509
If we're given one of those assignments or some other one,

00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:52.509
we could even hesitate to accept, give into fear.

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:59.509
But the fact is that we cannot fully see ourselves as Jehovah does.

00:09:59.509 --> 00:10:03.509
How much better to make ourselves available?

00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:07.509
And then move forward with the work that we're given to do,

00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:12.509
Jehovah, to make up for whatever we may lack.

00:10:12.509 --> 00:10:16.509
When I'll use students who are soon to be graduates,

00:10:16.509 --> 00:10:21.509
we'll no doubt have a variety of assignments in the coming years.

00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:28.509
Whatever those assignments are, move forward with full confidence in Jehovah.

00:10:28.509 --> 00:10:30.509
Jehovah will be with you.

00:10:30.509 --> 00:10:36.509
He'll give you everything that you need to be successful in accomplishing the work.

00:10:36.509 --> 00:10:39.509
So, here's the question.

00:10:39.509 --> 00:10:42.509
Can you see yourself as Jehovah sees you?

00:10:42.509 --> 00:10:48.509
Well, perhaps to some extent, yes, but not completely.

00:10:48.509 --> 00:10:54.509
So, be ready to listen to counsel and to make adjustments.

00:10:54.509 --> 00:11:01.509
But also, when your good qualities and your good potential are noticed,

00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:08.509
and you receive new assignments, grab hold, and move forward.

00:11:08.509 --> 00:11:16.509
And may our wonderful God, Jehovah, always be with you and bless you as you do so.

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:29.350
Well, now we're looking forward to the first talk of our Gilead graduation program.

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:34.350
It's going to be from a member of the United States Branch Committee, Brother Jesse Morris,

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:51.210
and his theme is, what will you be called?

00:11:51.210 --> 00:12:01.210
The greatest honor anyone can have is to be called a servant of the most high God, Jehovah.

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:05.210
And as you've seen from your deep study of God's Word,

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:12.210
servants of Jehovah also have distinct personality traits and qualities that are called to mind

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:14.210
when their names are mentioned.

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:22.210
For example, what qualities or traits do you think of when we mention the following names?

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:31.210
Ruth, Gideon, David, Martha.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:40.210
Yes, the name of a servant of Jehovah can call to mind certain qualities, certain traits that are worthy of imitation.

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:45.519
So, what will you be called?

00:12:45.519 --> 00:12:54.519
As you begin your new assignment, what quality or trait would you like your fellow workers to think about when your name is mentioned?

00:12:54.519 --> 00:13:01.860
The Bible book of Proverbs provides a very reachable goal in this regard.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:08.860
Please open to Proverbs chapter 16, and we'll read together verse 21.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.860
That's Proverbs chapter 16, verse 21.

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:20.899
The wise in heart will be called understanding.

00:13:20.899 --> 00:13:25.899
What a worthy goal that is to be called a person of understanding.

00:13:25.899 --> 00:13:34.899
Now, from your studies, you know understanding is the ability to put the facts together, grasp the full complete picture of a matter.

00:13:34.899 --> 00:13:37.899
So, how is understanding demonstrated?

00:13:37.899 --> 00:13:50.899
Is it revealed in a test score or is it revealed by being the first to provide a solution in a group setting or perhaps at a meeting?

00:13:50.899 --> 00:13:54.899
Well, let's keep reading, verse 21.

00:13:54.899 --> 00:14:00.899
And the one kind in speech adds persuasiveness.

00:14:00.899 --> 00:14:12.899
There's how understanding is demonstrated in kind speech or as the footnote indicates appealing speech, sweetness of lips.

00:14:12.899 --> 00:14:23.899
So, a person who's called understanding puts the facts together, grasps the full picture in order to find good in a matter.

00:14:24.899 --> 00:14:30.899
And that is reflected through kind, positive, persuasive speech.

00:14:30.899 --> 00:14:37.899
Now, this is more than just being optimistic or the power of positive thinking.

00:14:37.899 --> 00:14:40.899
Understanding has a source.

00:14:40.899 --> 00:14:46.899
Please turn to Proverbs this time, chapter 9, and we'll read verse 10.

00:14:46.899 --> 00:14:50.899
That's Proverbs chapter 9, verse 10.

00:14:50.899 --> 00:14:59.899
The atmosphere of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom and knowledge of the most holy one is understanding.

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:05.899
There is the source, the most holy one, Jehovah God.

00:15:05.899 --> 00:15:12.899
He's both the source of understanding and he's the supreme example in how to use it.

00:15:12.899 --> 00:15:21.899
I just think for a moment of what happened after the tragic, painful rebellion in the Garden of Eden, what did Jehovah do?

00:15:21.899 --> 00:15:35.899
Immediately, he put the facts together, he saw the complete picture, and then he uttered the Edenic promise, a positive promise that gives us hope, even right after that painful tragedy.

00:15:35.899 --> 00:15:46.899
And hundreds of years later, with the nation of Israel, they would repeatedly abandon Jehovah, what would he do?

00:15:46.899 --> 00:15:57.899
He would hear their groanings, he would hear their cries, he would see their changed attitude, and he would raise up judges to save them time after time.

00:15:58.899 --> 00:16:12.899
Yes, Jehovah God shows us what real understanding is, and because we trust in Him, we too can find the good, speak and act kindly and positively.

00:16:12.899 --> 00:16:25.899
And how refreshing it is to see this in your class, your kind, positive speech and actions with one another, and with those that you come in contact with, has been very refreshing to see.

00:16:25.899 --> 00:16:37.899
It's a result of your deep trust in God's Word, and your deep trust in Jehovah Himself, and your studies have just further enhanced that over these past few months.

00:16:37.899 --> 00:16:45.899
In contrast, much of the world's education fosters critical thinking, and note what the Watchtower says about this.

00:16:45.899 --> 00:17:02.889
We quote, do not be fooled by the mistaken notion that a cynical, critical, pessimistic attitude is the same as intelligence actually negative thinking demands little of the intellect.

00:17:02.889 --> 00:17:16.890
So what a privilege to know, as you dear students do, what real understanding is, it's not just the ability to identify what's wrong with the situation, it's the ability to identify how good can address it.

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:20.890
And this will encourage your brothers and sisters.

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:26.890
One Bethel family member observed understanding in the assistant overseer of a department.

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:35.890
On one occasion, the department overseer scheduled a meeting with several brothers from other departments, but he forgot to inform his assistant.

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:40.890
Then on the day of the meeting, the overseer was away.

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:50.200
So several brothers arrived for a meeting that the assistant knew nothing about. What would he do?

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:55.200
It was observed he said a brief silent prayer came out, welcome to group.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:18:05.200
Addressed the points for discussion, and at the end said, thank you brothers for coming to this meeting and allowing me to fill in for the overseer, and I'll update him when he returns.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:12.200
He just covered for him. Beautiful example. He knew this man had shouldered responsibility for decades. This was not his pattern.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:16.200
So he just applied good. He showed understanding.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:25.200
Now realistically, there will be days when it will be hard to be known as a person of understanding.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:36.200
What if, though, there's a prolonged period of time where we're finding it difficult to find the good, to speak and act kindly and positively.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:48.200
Maybe our mate or a trusted friend even speaks with us and says, your kind, positive speech and actions are changing. What can we do?

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:59.200
Well, each person and their relationship with Jehovah is unique, but let's consider the example of the writer of Psalm 73 and learn a valuable principle.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:10.200
The writer of this inspired Psalm was struggling with even whether or not to serve Jehovah. Note the turmoil he's in at Psalm 73 verse 14.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:19.759
And I was troubled all day long. Every morning I was chastised.

00:19:19.759 --> 00:19:33.759
Now it can be difficult to be known as a person of understanding when we're in this frame of mind. In fact, in verse 22, the Psalmist honestly admits I was unreasoning and lacked understanding.

00:19:33.759 --> 00:19:43.759
So what would he do? Could he ever be called understanding again? Notice verse 15.

00:19:43.759 --> 00:19:50.759
But if I had said these things, I would have betrayed your people.

00:19:50.759 --> 00:19:59.759
So first, the Psalmist held back from making his perplexing thoughts public. He knew that that kind of negative speech would affect God's people.

00:19:59.759 --> 00:20:10.759
He likened it to a betrayal as if he were releasing the names of his fellow worshipers to the enemy. That's what he likened negative speech to.

00:20:10.759 --> 00:20:21.759
Instead, he kept to his spiritual routine and waited. And then a powerful moment took place in verse 26.

00:20:21.759 --> 00:20:40.220
My body and my heart may fail. But God is the rock of my heart and my portion forever. There it is. Understanding.

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:55.220
The Psalmist knew he was not alone. Jehovah God, the immovable rock was keeping him stable in the midst of this violent windstorm that he found himself in.

00:20:55.220 --> 00:21:10.220
That powerful realization plugged him back in to the source of understanding. And he was once again able to put the facts together, find good in a matter, and speak and act kindly and positively.

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:19.220
What's the lesson? When we are in turmoil and feel lacking in understanding, we are in good company.

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:31.220
Many faithful servants of Jehovah have felt this way. When we do, like the Psalmist, we hold back from negative speech, which can affect those around us.

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:39.220
Instead, we speak privately with a trusted friend. We keep to our spiritual routine and we wait.

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:59.500
We wait for our powerful moment. The realization that Jehovah God is the rock of our heart. And one final point demonstrating understanding includes demonstrating it with ourself.

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:17.500
You will make mistakes. And when you do, your trust in Jehovah will allow you to find the good in yourself, as Brother Sanderson mentioned in the opening comments. And that will help you to keep a positive frame of mind.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:27.500
Well, we know Jehovah God is going to be with you in your assignments. May your trust in him, the source of understanding continue to deepen.

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:39.500
This will allow you to address situations by putting the facts together, finding good in a matter, and speaking and acting kindly, positively, persuasively.

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:59.619
When you do this, you will be showing that you are wise in heart and you will be called understanding.

00:22:59.619 --> 00:23:15.619
Well, we thank you so much, Brother Morris, for that very, very encouraging talk. Well, now we're interested to hear from a helper with the writing committee, Brother Nicholas Alatus. His theme for us today is, there is a river.

00:23:15.619 --> 00:23:30.619
Well, earthquakes have been in the news quite a bit recently, but we're going to read about an earthquake in Psalm 46, which describes one that has never happened in recorded history.

00:23:30.619 --> 00:23:45.769
Psalm 46, starting with verse 1, says, there God is our refuge and strength, a help that is readily found in times of distress.

00:23:45.769 --> 00:23:57.769
That is why we will not fear, though the earth undergoes change, or some translations say, though the earth quakes, though the mountains topple into the depths of the sea,

00:23:57.769 --> 00:24:05.769
though its waters roar and foam over, though the mountains rock on account of its turbulence.

00:24:05.769 --> 00:24:14.769
Now, there's no evidence that this poetic description of mountains toppling into the sea literally happened in ancient Israel.

00:24:14.769 --> 00:24:24.769
But clearly, the world around the psalma seemed to be collapsing somehow. What catastrophic situation is being referred to?

00:24:24.769 --> 00:24:36.769
Well, the watchtower has explained that this psalm seems to fit the time of King Hezekiah when Jerusalem was being threatened by Sinacra, the king of Assyria.

00:24:36.769 --> 00:24:49.769
Now, we know those threats were not empty. Sinacra had conquered surrounding nations. He had also conquered the fortified cities around Jerusalem that were protecting the city.

00:24:49.769 --> 00:24:58.769
He'd actually overrun the villages right up to Nob, and Nob was within sight of Jerusalem one mile away.

00:24:58.769 --> 00:25:13.769
And as you know, Assyria was famous for its cruelty. They found palace walls from Sinacra's time that showed shocking scenes of brutality toward conquered peoples.

00:25:13.769 --> 00:25:22.769
So we can understand why the psalmist felt the world was collapsing. The description is so ominous and bleak.

00:25:22.769 --> 00:25:29.769
But suddenly, in verse 4, the tone of the psalm changes completely.

00:25:29.769 --> 00:25:46.769
There is a river, the streams of which make the city of God rejoice. The holy, grand tabernacle of the most high. God is in the city. It cannot be overthrown. God will come to its aid at the break of dawn.

00:25:46.769 --> 00:25:52.769
So the psalmist thoughts go from catastrophe and chaos to peace and confidence.

00:25:52.769 --> 00:26:02.769
In verse 4, it speaks about a river in the city of God. There's no river flowing in Jerusalem, so what is this referring to?

00:26:02.769 --> 00:26:09.769
Well, some suggest that it refers to Hezekiah's tunnel that was built in order to bring water into the city.

00:26:09.769 --> 00:26:23.769
But the poetic structure of the psalm actually parallels the river to the holy tabernacle of Jehovah, the holy tabernacle of the most high and the pure worship carried on there.

00:26:23.769 --> 00:26:42.769
And it's interesting that when Hezekiah received the threats from Sinacra, the Scriptures say at 2 Kings 19 that Hezekiah took the letters from the Assyrians, he went into the temple, he spread them out before Jehovah and he prayed fervently.

00:26:42.769 --> 00:26:59.769
And then Jehovah sent a reassuring message through Isaiah. I have heard your prayer to me concerning Sinacra king of Assyria. He will not come into the city or shoot an arrow there or bring a shield or siege rampart against it.

00:27:00.769 --> 00:27:14.769
Now, the sons of Korah who recorded this psalm may have seen Hezekiah going into the temple and then heard Jehovah's response through Isaiah. And this would give them complete confidence in the outcome.

00:27:15.769 --> 00:27:22.769
And we all know what happened next. The huge Assyrian army was vanquished overnight by an angel.

00:27:22.769 --> 00:27:34.049
And it could be that verse 5 alludes to this where it says God will come to its aid at the break of dawn. But what does this psalm teach us?

00:27:34.049 --> 00:27:48.049
Well, the psalmist example of focusing on pure worship and his word, which is likened to a river in this psalm, shows that we can experience peace even when the world around us seems to be collapsing.

00:27:49.049 --> 00:28:01.049
The psalmist declared God is in the city. He was its ruler, not Sinacra. For decades, Judah had been wayward and God was not in Jerusalem.

00:28:01.049 --> 00:28:16.049
But Hezekiah renovated the temple and restored pure worship there. That pure worship was like a river of blessing that connected the people to Jehovah and gave powerful evidence that God was in the city.

00:28:18.049 --> 00:28:27.049
Our pure worship book associates the river of Psalm 46 with the river that flowed from Jehovah's Sanctuary and Ezekiel's vision.

00:28:27.049 --> 00:28:44.049
And you might recall that that river became wider and deeper the further it flowed. And the pure worship book says about it, like the visionary river that Ezekiel saw, the flow of pure truce has expanded rapidly.

00:28:45.049 --> 00:28:54.049
And today, the flow of that river includes Bibles, Bible-based publications and videos in over a thousand languages.

00:28:54.049 --> 00:29:04.049
Ezekiel said that the river got so deep that a person had to swim. And for the last five months, you students have felt like Ezekiel.

00:29:04.049 --> 00:29:22.930
Your course has immersed you and sometimes taken you underwater. And that was from the flood of Bible knowledge you received through your study, your lectures, and also the interaction with the students and also your instructors.

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:26.930
And you may have felt like you were even drowning sometimes.

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:36.930
But like Hezekiah and those with them, you've also been in the confines of a secure city where Jehovah's worship prevails.

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:46.930
During these months, the world has been dealing with the aftermath of the pandemic and wars and other disasters. But you were like the psalmist.

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:57.369
The earth could quake, the mountains could topple, but you enjoyed a special period of peace because you were focused on that river.

00:29:57.369 --> 00:30:10.369
Now you're going back out into the trenches with the rest of us, so to speak. Some of you will serve where there's economic toil, a turmoil or violence or other disasters.

00:30:10.369 --> 00:30:20.369
Or you may personally face health trials, even persecution. But the lesson of Gilead and the lesson of Psalm 46 can serve you well.

00:30:20.369 --> 00:30:31.369
When you stay focused on the river, Jehovah's pure worship, you can remain confident and joyful regardless of what challenges life brings.

00:30:31.369 --> 00:30:42.369
An ancient Greek writer said, no man ever steps in the same river twice for it's not the same river and he's not the same man.

00:30:42.369 --> 00:30:55.369
It isn't a true that our lives are constantly changing and new challenges suddenly crop up. But Jehovah's river of blessings just keeps flowing and is constantly renewed.

00:30:55.369 --> 00:31:06.369
It supplies life giving water in all circumstances. And this is so even when the figurative mountains of this world are toppling and the world is in chaos.

00:31:06.369 --> 00:31:25.680
A sister in the war zone in eastern Ukraine wrote, what we needed most was spiritual food. We were overwhelmed with joy when we received the JW boxes after the internet failed and spiritual food became available again.

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:42.680
Despite many challenges and difficulties, when we meet with fellow believers our problems are not the main subject of discussion. More often we share how thank how Jehovah supports us, what has strengthened us and what we're thankful for.

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:55.680
We can sense her calmness. These friends are living examples of how focusing on the river can preserve our peace even in times of disaster.

00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:19.680
Now returning to Psalm 46, we can paraphrase verses 8 and 9 which may have occurred when the angel destroyed the Issyrian army. It says, Jehovah has done astonishing things in the earth bringing an end to wars breaking the bow and the spear and burning the military wagons.

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:28.680
We can just imagine the astonishing scene going out into the Issyrian camp and seeing the entire army devastated.

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:38.680
Now what does that mean for us? Well we hate the war and violence that plagues this world and affects our dear brothers and we long for it to end.

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:48.680
But until then understanding that Jehovah is still in the city, still in control with this people gives us complete confidence.

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:57.680
No humans, no attack of an Issyrian-like government can stop the flow of that river or shake the city.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:13.680
And the Psalmist concludes in verse 11 with the reassuring echo of verse 1, Jehovah of Armies is with us. The God of Jacob is a secure refuge for us.

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:25.680
Well we don't know what your individual future holds after Gilead, what assignments you'll receive, but you can be confident that Jehovah is in the city, he's in control.

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:38.680
And remember the lesson of Gilead, stay focused on the river. The river that makes the city of God rejoice. The river that will flow throughout eternity.

00:33:51.549 --> 00:34:00.549
Thank you so much, Brother Alatis, that is absolutely one of my favorite scriptures and so reassuring during such challenging times.

00:34:00.549 --> 00:34:14.989
Well now we're going to begin a series of three talks by instructors from the Gilead school. So first of all we are going to start with Brother Trent Lipold and his theme for us is The Underroar.

00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:39.989
He is famously the object and not the subject of a Bible account. We easily sympathize with his with him because we can understand his emotions and feelings at the time. Yet his response is that which provides a powerful life lesson in our service to God.

00:34:39.989 --> 00:35:06.690
We're introduced to him in the book of Mark chapter 14, Mark chapter 14 beginning in verse 50 verse 50 picks up the account of Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane and we read of the 11 faithful apostles and they all abandoned him and fled.

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:20.690
However, a certain young man wearing only a fine linen garment over his naked body began to follow him nearby and they tried to seize him, but he left his linen garment behind and got away naked.

00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:39.030
The young man in this verse is understood to be John Mark and notice John Mark's outstanding quality when the apostles all fled it says John Mark followed nearby.

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:50.030
What tremendous courage of this young man while the great man the apostles fled Mark stayed and he followed nearby.

00:35:51.030 --> 00:36:07.030
Now, interestingly, we know that Peter eventually also followed, but notice this about Peter in verse 54, but Peter from a good distance followed John Mark followed nearby.

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:27.409
In this we see not only the courage of John Mark, but we also see his devotion to Jesus. To what extent he knew Jesus or had interactions with Jesus, we don't know, but he did have some and his devotion and courage for his master is unquestionable here.

00:36:27.409 --> 00:36:48.409
The scriptures also describe Mark, John Mark as a strengthening aid and a great comfort. Those were the observations of him later in his life and we do know from the scriptures that John Mark worked in the background for some very big personalities, the Apostle Paul, the Apostle Peter and Barnabas.

00:36:48.409 --> 00:37:13.409
John Mark initially caught the attention of the Apostles of Paul and Barnabas when he was in Jerusalem. Paul or Saul at the time and Barnabas came there in 46 CE and they took John Mark with them to the exciting assignment of Antioch where Christianity was beginning to flourish and John Mark was brought along with them.

00:37:14.409 --> 00:37:31.869
Later in the year 47 John Mark is selected to go with Barnabas and Saul on the first missionary tour. It's described for us in the book of Acts chapter 13. In Acts chapter 13 verses 4 and 5 it says,

00:37:31.869 --> 00:37:52.869
So these men that is Barnabas and Saul sent out by Holy Spirit went down to Salusia and from there they sailed away to Cyprus. When they arrived in Salamis they began proclaiming the word of God and the synagogues of the Jews. They also had John as an attendant, John Mark.

00:37:52.869 --> 00:38:05.869
He is described here as an attendant, the footnote says an assistant, the writer of Acts use a very interesting word here for attendant and it's a Greek word that literally means an under-roar.

00:38:05.869 --> 00:38:20.869
An under-roar was a man who worked below the decks on a large Roman naval vessel. He would be below deck, he would have to row in unison in cooperation with his fellow-roars

00:38:20.869 --> 00:38:34.869
and he would have to follow the pace set by the captain. Why would this term be used for John Mark in this instance? Well the clue comes from verse 4 where it says they sailed away to Cyprus.

00:38:34.869 --> 00:38:49.869
So the metaphor of an under-roar now takes on greater meaning. Incidentally the same term is used by the Apostle Paul when he refers to himself as a servant of God or an attendant in 1 Corinthians chapter 4.

00:38:49.869 --> 00:39:06.869
Why would that be significant? Why use it in 1 Corinthians? Because in one of the bays next to Corinth the large ships of the Roman navy took port there and so again the metaphor of the under-roar would take on great meaning.

00:39:07.869 --> 00:39:25.869
Well the infamous event occurred in Acts chapter 15, the event which John Mark was an object of. Notice in Acts chapter 15 beginning in verse 37 it says,

00:39:25.869 --> 00:39:39.869
Barnabas was determined to take along John who was called Mark. Paul however was not in favor of taking him along with them, seeing that he had departed from them in Pamphilia and had not gone with them to the work.

00:39:39.869 --> 00:39:50.869
At this there was a sharp burst of anger so that they separated from each other and Barnabas took Mark along and sailed away to Cyprus.

00:39:50.869 --> 00:40:09.869
Denied an opportunity, denied a privilege. What does Mark do? It says he sailed away with Barnabas to Cyprus. Mark kept active in Jehovah's service. How does he do that?

00:40:09.869 --> 00:40:26.380
Paul, a part of me, John Mark was not so concerned about a lost privilege that he failed to appreciate the opportunities that were in front of him. Well while he's sailing away and working, what's Paul doing?

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:36.380
Verse 41, 40 and 41 say Paul selected Silas, 41 says he went through Syria and Salatia strengthening the congregations.

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:56.780
Now as you carry on in chapter 16 we find him arriving in Derbe and Lystra and verse 3, a part of me, verse 1 says he met Timothy, a disciple, verse 3 what happens. Paul expressed a desire for Timothy to join him.

00:40:56.780 --> 00:41:09.409
Mark's replacement. Interestingly, as Paul now begins to travel with Timothy, we find that the Apostle Paul writes to the Thessalonians within a year.

00:41:09.409 --> 00:41:22.409
And in first Thessalonians 1 verse 1, Paul's greeting is from Paul, Silas and Timothy. Second Thessalonians to from Paul, Silas and Timothy.

00:41:22.409 --> 00:41:33.409
I wonder how Timothy's, pardon me, I wonder how Mark's feeling at this point. Five years later he writes to the Corinthians and again now it's from Paul and Timothy.

00:41:33.409 --> 00:41:41.409
During all this time where Timothy is rising, what's Mark doing? He's rowing.

00:41:41.409 --> 00:41:52.409
Mark is continually faithfully serving Jehovah 11 years later in the year 60 to 61 when Paul was in Rome, who was with him? John Mark.

00:41:52.409 --> 00:42:10.409
And when Paul wrote letters to various congregations he describes John Mark. In fact in one of the letters in sending greetings, this is in Colossians, he makes reference to the fact that he had wanted to send John Mark as a personal representative to the congregations.

00:42:10.409 --> 00:42:25.409
And that indicates to us what kind of man Mark was and what reputation he had. A personal representative was someone who was deeply trusted and he would have to represent Paul before the congregations that he would visit.

00:42:26.409 --> 00:42:39.409
That is the reputation of John Mark. You know, there's no record in the scriptures of the challenges that John Mark faced in his ministry. There's no shipwrecks, no beedings, no hunger, no left for dead for John Mark.

00:42:39.409 --> 00:42:51.409
But there is one challenge that he faced that is shared with us. And that is his difficulty or the challenge with the Apostle Paul, his brother.

00:42:51.409 --> 00:42:57.409
And yet clearly there were no hard feelings between these two men, even though there was a difference.

00:42:57.409 --> 00:43:12.690
In fact, Paul's final words chronologically in the book of 2 Timothy chapter 4, in reference to John Mark, he tells Timothy, bring Mark, he's helpful, the underroer, John Mark.

00:43:13.690 --> 00:43:30.690
Interestingly, for all that we know about Timothy, there are no words recorded of Timothy's in the scriptures. And yet John Mark wrote a gospel. And as a typical underroer, he never mentioned his name.

00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:45.690
So when we put the pieces together of what is shared of John Mark in the scriptures, we get a portrait of a man who was one zealous for promoting the good news in the worldwide field and two happy to serve others.

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:52.690
This alone is worthy of our imitation. But there is more.

00:43:52.690 --> 00:44:00.690
In your future, you may be the object caught up in a Paul and Barnabas moment.

00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:12.690
You may face changed circumstances due to health or family issues. You may be the one who has to work in the shadow of Timothy.

00:44:12.690 --> 00:44:28.690
A door may close for you or be closed for you. But like Mark, do not be so concerned about lost privileges that you fail to appreciate the opportunities that are right in front of you.

00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:41.690
May you, like Mark, keep your heart and your hands strong. Keep them on the oars. Work in unison, cooperate with your brothers and sisters for the master.

00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:46.690
May you, like Mark, be the underroer.

00:44:46.690 --> 00:45:00.420
Thank you. Thank you so much, Brother Lippled, for that very practical counsel.

00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:08.420
Well, now we hear from another one of the instructors of the Gilead School Brother, Richard Chilton, and his theme for us today is,

00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:11.420
Where you go, I will go.

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:15.670
What do the following have in common?

00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:24.670
Build an ark. Choose 300 men. March around the city seven times.

00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:30.670
Follow this route to the Red Sea. Did you figure it out?

00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:45.670
Jehovah was providing his people with direction. And in the case of these examples, sometimes that direction could appear to be, let's say, a bit unusual.

00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:53.670
It's not too hard for us to imagine Noah responding, and you want me to build a massive ark.

00:45:53.670 --> 00:46:03.670
Or Gideon asking, just 300 men against an army of 135,000, are you sure?

00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:14.670
Or Joshua replying, march around Jericho seven times and just blow our horns. That's it.

00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:25.670
Or Moses saying, why are we headed to the Red Sea when I believe there is a much more direct route to the promised land?

00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:32.670
They all could have responded in such ways. But did they?

00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:38.670
Let's allow the Bible to help us find the answer. Genesis chapter six.

00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:49.670
In Genesis chapter six, verse 22, we find that Noah did according to all that God had commanded him.

00:46:49.670 --> 00:47:01.670
He did just so. In fact, in the examples we've mentioned, they all did just so.

00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:15.670
The direction might not have been what they expected, but they humbly made the mental turn, so to speak, and they followed the divine guidance wherever it was taking them.

00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:23.670
And because they did, they saved not only themselves, but all those that were with them.

00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:40.920
The one leading them was Jehovah. And by their responsive actions, they were in effect, saying to him, where you go, I will go.

00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:53.920
Well, what about you dear graduates here before us today? Like those faithful ones of old, you are not alone in navigating your way.

00:47:53.920 --> 00:48:01.920
Jehovah is where he has always been at the helm, guiding his people.

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:10.920
The only difference is today, Jehovah is providing direction through his faithful and discreet slain.

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:21.920
And it is due to our limited understanding that at times the direction may appear to be a bit unusual.

00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:31.920
Nonetheless, you have followed that direction no matter what it was, no matter where it was taking you.

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:44.920
And for that, we want to say thank you. In fact, we want to thank all of you in our listening audience for being responsive toward the direction providing.

00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:51.920
But we thank especially you dear Gilead graduates before us today. Now why?

00:48:51.920 --> 00:49:02.920
Because during the five months that we have spent with you, we saw you. We saw how you closely followed the direction of the faithful slave.

00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:13.920
You did just so. For example, when presenting your student assignments, you did so in English.

00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:30.920
Even though for most of you, that was not your mother tongue. And when COVID protocols were set in place, we saw you follow all of them, even though they might have been inconvenient, in order to keep you in your classmates healthy.

00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:43.920
And when you were given counsel, not only from your instructors, but from each other, you expressed gratitude for it and immediately went to work at applying it.

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:55.300
We saw you growing your love for one another, for God's organization, for Jehovah, and for His Son Jesus.

00:49:55.300 --> 00:50:09.739
All of this was a direct result of your sensitivity to the direction of the faithful slave. But what about after you leave this place?

00:50:09.739 --> 00:50:19.739
Even if you are assigned back to the country of origin, you won't be the same person that left.

00:50:19.739 --> 00:50:32.739
And things may not be the way you remember them either. However, we have full confidence that whatever future changes come your way.

00:50:32.739 --> 00:50:45.739
You will continue echoing the sentiments of the Moabitis Ruth. Recall when she was faced with numerous intimidating changes, what she said to Naomi.

00:50:45.739 --> 00:50:53.739
Her words are recorded for us in Ruth chapter 1, the book bearing her name, verse 16 and 17.

00:50:53.739 --> 00:50:56.739
Ruth said,

00:50:56.739 --> 00:51:08.739
Do not plead with me to abandon you, to turn back from accompanying you. For where you go, I will go.

00:51:09.739 --> 00:51:18.739
And where you spend the night, I will spend the night. Your people will be my people and your God, my God.

00:51:18.739 --> 00:51:24.739
Where you die, I will die. And there I will be buried.

00:51:24.739 --> 00:51:36.519
May Jehovah do so to me and add to it if anything but death should separate me from you.

00:51:36.519 --> 00:51:45.519
What did all of this actually mean for Ruth? It meant leaving what was familiar to her.

00:51:45.519 --> 00:52:00.519
It meant adopting a people with beliefs different from hers. It meant following customs that could result in her becoming the wife of someone she did not choose or did not even know for that matter.

00:52:00.519 --> 00:52:06.519
It meant never returning to what she had left behind.

00:52:06.519 --> 00:52:19.519
When Ruth said to Naomi, where you go, I will go. She met with no clauses, no exceptions, no bargaining. It was without question.

00:52:19.519 --> 00:52:33.519
For Ruth, these were not just words. It was her mind set. It was the same mindset that Noah, Gideon, Joshua and Moses had.

00:52:33.519 --> 00:52:46.519
And like them, if we endeavor to always see the one behind the direction, we will be able to move in heart harmony with the chariot.

00:52:46.519 --> 00:52:58.519
Not under it, not behind it, right alongside it. In fact, this thought brings back to my mind a fond memory.

00:52:58.519 --> 00:53:06.519
I recall when my wife and I lived in South Africa, I once observed a flock of birds in motion.

00:53:06.519 --> 00:53:23.519
I was a species, I do not know. But I'm sure they numbered into the thousands. And as they swirled and turned as a group in unison, it was a beautiful magnificent sight to behold.

00:53:23.519 --> 00:53:37.519
What's interesting is that scientists think that each bird focuses not on the entire flock, but on just a few of its most nearest neighbors in flight.

00:53:37.519 --> 00:53:51.929
When those near them turn, they turn. Each one does this creating a sort of harmonious wave effect, well in a similar way.

00:53:51.929 --> 00:54:03.929
When we display by our speech in actions, the mindset, Jehovah, where you and your slave go, I will go.

00:54:03.929 --> 00:54:20.929
We motivate others near us to do the same. When a change in theocratic direction comes and we make the turn, then our spiritual brothers and sisters make the turn with us.

00:54:20.929 --> 00:54:30.929
And when Jehovah's people turn and sink in mid-flight, so to speak, it is a beautiful thing in the eyes of Jehovah.

00:54:30.929 --> 00:54:49.929
Just as Noah, Gideon, Joshua, Moses and Ruth set the pattern for all of us, now their graduates, it is your turn to set the pattern for others.

00:54:50.929 --> 00:55:03.929
As you continue to follow closely, the direction provided by Jehovah through his faithful slave, others will see his blessing upon you.

00:55:03.929 --> 00:55:12.929
They will see how he is keeping you safe and secure. They will see your joy and contentment.

00:55:12.929 --> 00:55:23.929
And out of a keen desire to have that same experience, they too will be motivated to say, where you go, I will go.

00:55:23.929 --> 00:55:43.010
Thank you so much, Brother Chilton, the very, very practical advice for the students and for all of us. We appreciate it so much.

00:55:44.010 --> 00:55:52.010
Well, we hear now from the third and final instructor from the Gilead School, Brother James Cawthon, and his theme for us today is,

00:55:52.010 --> 00:56:02.989
counselor or shepherd, which has greater appeal, an effective counselor or loving shepherd.

00:56:03.989 --> 00:56:16.989
If you're to be effective brothers and sisters in strengthening the organization and building up the brotherhood, it's a good subject to consider, and it includes you sisters too.

00:56:16.989 --> 00:56:31.989
A counselor can be defined as one who gives advice. Now the world has a lot of counselors. They've got marriage counselors and financial counselors and bereavement counselors and all kinds of counselors.

00:56:31.989 --> 00:56:39.989
And you'll find that their counsel varies according to their experience and education.

00:56:39.989 --> 00:56:50.989
A hithful is a biblical example of a counselor and the Bible says what he advised was considered as the word of the true God.

00:56:50.989 --> 00:57:00.989
Today, person might feel that he is a good counselor and he may freely offer advice, some of which may or may not be.

00:57:01.989 --> 00:57:27.179
Accept it. Maybe a solution oriented husband counsels his emotionally distraught wife to just quit worry or well versed elder quickly reads a Bible text and he advises an extreme and anxiety filled publisher to just get over it.

00:57:27.179 --> 00:57:38.820
How effective is such counsel? There's a saying people don't care how much you know until they know how much you care.

00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:52.820
Counsel is more effective when the counselor is also a shepherd. A shepherd is one who comforts nourishes listens and does not ignore the emotional needs of the distraught one.

00:57:52.820 --> 00:58:09.820
Jehovah gives counsel or advice, but he always does more. You see, he also shepherds. When he counsels, he tends to the person's emotional needs and he provides a needed follow up.

00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:21.820
Consider how he dealt with an emotionally depressed prophet by the name of Elijah. I'm turning to first Kings 19.

00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:39.820
And we're going to consider just briefly the interaction he had with Elijah. And you will recall that he was driven by fear Elijah was driven by fear of Jezebel Elijah fled southward for 95 miles to Bersheba.

00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:54.820
And then he walked for about another 200 miles to Mount Hora. But now notice in verse 5, it says then he that is Elijah lay down and fell asleep under the broom tree.

00:58:54.820 --> 00:59:06.820
But suddenly an angel touched him and said to him, get up and eat. When he looked there, his head was around loaf on heated stones and a jug of water.

00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:20.820
He ate and drank and laid down again. Later the angel of Jehovah came back a second time and touched him and said, get up and eat for the journey will be too much for you.

00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:33.820
So he got up and ate a drink and knew the strength of that nourishment. He went on for 40 days and 40 nights until he reached Hora the mountain of the true God.

00:59:33.820 --> 01:00:06.940
You notice the angel awakened Elijah ministered to him and Elijah went back to sleep like depressed ones often do maybe the angel waited all night in the heat touched Elijah again and then gave him more nourishment nourishment such as would take him 40 days and 40 nights on his journey to Mount Hora.

01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:28.940
Now here's a question you have to ask yourself. Do you think that that angel agreed with way Elijah was acting? Do you think the angel might have wanted to give a little counsel and tell Elijah, look Elijah, just get over it.

01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:43.940
Just trust God and get back to your assignment. But he didn't. Do you think Jehovah knew how Elijah was thinking? Do you think he agreed with it? No, definitely not.

01:00:43.940 --> 01:01:06.940
See a counselor may have handled it one way, but Jehovah the God of all comfort would first address Elijah's emotional needs. So when Elijah finally entered the cave at Mount Hora, remember what Jehovah did in a calm low voice gentle voice.

01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:30.940
He said Elijah, what is your business here? And that was a warm invitation for Elijah to express himself just talk to me. You see. And so Elijah did look at verse 10 and see what was it Elijah said? He said, I have been absolutely zealous for Jehovah the God of armies for the people of Israel for say, can you covenant.

01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:59.940
So Elijah felt like his work was in vain. And then he said, I'm the only one left. Elijah felt alone. And he said, there are seeking to take me away. Take my life away. So Elijah was also afraid. Would you overheard what he said? And he addressed all of Elijah's concern. And then afterwards, he gave Elijah the encouragement that would allow him to continue on.

01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:15.940
And to continue on in Jehovah's service with boldness. So how can we learn from this brief experience? Well, we learn the Jehovah validated demands emotions without agreeing with his thinking.

01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:30.940
And we also learn there's often not necessary to offer a quick solution, simply allowing a person to express themselves without feeling judged can bring tremendous relief.

01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:40.940
In fact, friends, and being heard is so close to being loved that for the average person, it's indistinguishable.

01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:53.940
Like Jehovah will be more effective if for patient shepherds that listen and give thoughtful consideration to the feelings of those that were seeking to help.

01:02:53.940 --> 01:03:15.940
So here are four takeaway points. Okay. Number one, be a listener, not a lecturer, show empathy. And remember, empathy is seeing with the eyes of another, hearing with the ears of another and feeling with a heart of another.

01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:26.940
It's easy, friends, for imperfect humans to take themselves too seriously, especially when they're given a position of responsibility.

01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:37.940
So at times, it may even be best to refrain from offering counsel too soon because that creates an air of superiority.

01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:56.449
Conversely, a willingness to hear even wild talk from another will reveal the depth of our own humility. Point number two, validate people's emotions and don't just dismiss them.

01:03:56.449 --> 01:04:09.449
Feelings are real, so know the difference between validating and invalidating statements. I can see why you would feel that way. That must be really hard.

01:04:09.449 --> 01:04:23.449
You see, when we listen with empathy, what we're really saying is, you matter to me that you're important and I care how you feel.

01:04:24.449 --> 01:04:34.920
Additionally, when you validate the other person, they become significantly more likely to listen to advice or counsel later.

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:48.360
Remember, there is a difference between, and by the way, let me just say this, that counsel is not necessarily good just because it's accurate.

01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:58.360
Frankly, how you give it and when you give it is important. So try to remember that just because it's accurate doesn't make it good.

01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:03.360
And there's a difference too between validating and devastating.

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:17.800
You know, you're too sensitive. What's the big deal? I don't want to hear it. I don't have time for this. You need to work on your spirituality.

01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:35.179
Now, although we may not mean it, this can translate into, you're not important. Your feelings are important. And frankly, I don't really care. Point number three, acknowledge the vulnerability.

01:05:35.179 --> 01:05:42.179
Sharing personal thoughts and emotions can be difficult, uncomfortable, and even scary.

01:05:42.179 --> 01:05:53.179
But I think that we're encouraged to develop fellow feeling. And finally point number four, offering counsel is entirely optional.

01:05:53.179 --> 01:06:06.179
How many of us brothers have been on a shepherd and call and we've said virtually nothing. And the publisher, the brother and sister afterward says, you know what? That's the best shepherd and call I've ever had.

01:06:06.179 --> 01:06:22.130
So what some may need is not some solution for the problem, but simply to talk to a good listener, someone who will not tell them how they're supposed to feel, but will listen without being judgmental.

01:06:22.130 --> 01:06:33.130
The saying is friends, time is life. If we won't give a brother our time, you really think we would give our life for him.

01:06:33.130 --> 01:06:45.130
So when we show favor to the lonely one by giving him time and attention, we are in fact lending to Jehovah. And the Bible says that he will repay us in our time of need.

01:06:45.130 --> 01:06:55.130
So we've counsel and shepherding together, and you'll be treasured by all those around you and most of all by Jehovah God and Jesus Christ.

01:06:55.130 --> 01:07:20.099
Thank you so much, Brother Cauthan, for that very wise and practical counsel. I'm sure elders all around the world will benefit so much from hearing that talk when it goes up on JW Broadcasting.

01:07:20.099 --> 01:07:24.099
We hope you enjoyed part one of the graduation.

01:07:24.099 --> 01:07:35.099
Parts two and three will be available on JW.org later this month. Before we conclude, let's visit the island of Greenland.

01:07:35.099 --> 01:07:49.099
It's the world's largest island. What picture comes to your mind? White sandy beaches, warm sunny weather? No. Greenland is among the closest countries to the North Pole

01:07:49.099 --> 01:08:00.099
and is almost entirely covered by ice. The northern light stands on the night sky. Arctic foxes and polar bears roam the tundra.

01:08:00.099 --> 01:08:15.099
And icebergs dot the turquoise waters of the fjords. Greenland is the birthplace of the kayak, as Eskimo hunters needed a narrow vessel to navigate these icy waterways.
