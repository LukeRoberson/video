00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:08.800
I'm just a cart

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:15.320
Made up of bits and pieces a frame a handle and some wheels

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:23.269
But I'm a cart that helps to give a witness

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.789
What is that like?

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.949
Let me tell you how it feels if

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:33.469
You could see

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.869
What I see if you could visit

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.469
All the places that I go

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.310
If you could see the people there

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:53.070
And get a glimpse of all the faces that I get to know

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.549
If you could hear

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:02.270
I hear when they see things they've never had a chance

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.590
To see

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.709
That's when you'll see

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:09.709
How it can be

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:21.549
That forever I've got books and I've got tracks

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.269
I take the kingdom message everywhere

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:30.269
When the crowds pass me by

00:01:30.269 --> 00:01:32.909
I'm designed to catch their eye

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:35.469
Wherever
