00:00:02.609 --> 00:00:08.609
During the dry summer months in Israel, the sun baked and hardened the soil.

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:16.140
The farmer had to wait for the early autumn rain to soften the soil.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:31.260
Then he could begin plowing and sewing.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.920
While his crop grew, he waited patiently.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.920
Until the late rain caused the grain to develop fully.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:49.689
Finally, harvest time came.

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:53.689
And the farmer's patience was rewarded.
