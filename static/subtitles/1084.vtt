00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:07.710
This convention program will be translated into more than 400 languages.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.710
This work is supported by branch offices around the globe.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:20.710
Each of us has an opportunity to show appreciation for the spiritual blessings we have received in our own language.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:27.710
One way we can do this is by making voluntary gifts in accord with our circumstances.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:34.710
Donations can be made online at donate.jw.org.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:48.149
Please be seated. Have you faced serious obstacles as you try to do what Jehovah commands?

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.149
How conservants of God maintain their joy despite such challenges?

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:04.150
We invite you to watch and learn from the drama Nehemiah. The joy of Jehovah is your stronghold, Part 1.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:20.510
As we learned in our audio drama, the Jews returned to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple in 537 BCE.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:30.510
And by 515 BCE, it was finally completed. However, the city's walls were still left in ruins.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:40.510
Jehovah's time had now come to rebuild the walls and he used the faithful man Nehemiah to take the lead in this work.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.510
This would be a massive undertaking for the Jews. And once again, there were opposers.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:52.510
Nehemiah told the nation of Israel that the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:58.510
How could he encourage them to be joyful despite all the opposition?

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:07.510
What lessons can we learn from their example? There are many. But here are three to think about as you watch.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:15.509
What role did prayer play in helping Nehemiah to be a courageous person for Jehovah?

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:23.509
In addition to direct attacks, what schemes did the enemies employ to oppose the work?

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:29.509
Despite setbacks, what was Nehemiah's main source of joy?

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:38.509
Got it? All right then. With that in mind, please sit back and enjoy the following video presentation.

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:45.500
The joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:56.060
It was a privilege to have a share in the restoration of Jehovah's worship.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:05.189
People know we rebuilt the wall, but there is so much more to the story.

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:09.020
Let's start at the beginning.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:19.120
In the 20th year of King Arduzirksi's linger maintenance, I was in Shushan the palace.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:36.310
I was cut bearer to the king. He trusted me with his life.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:45.870
Although I was far from Jerusalem, I found great joy just thinking about our people there, serving Jehovah.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:55.500
Until one day, when I received a visit from my brother Henei, that visit changed everything.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:10.650
What's going on Henei? How are people?

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.650
Not good.

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.649
The conditions are disgraceful.

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:24.470
The walls of Jerusalem are broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:25.470
What about the temple?

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.470
It stands, but the services are nothing but empty rituals.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.470
Most of the people and the priests ignore God's law.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.470
You have to return with us.

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:50.759
For days, my conscience plagued me.

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:56.990
Would the king even allow me to go?

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:10.060
Our people had sinned by not keeping Jehovah's commandments.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:17.060
But now I felt as if I were sinning, by not helping them in their time of need.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:30.500
I begged Jehovah to grant me success.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.500
Nirmaya, why are you so gloomy when you're not sick?

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.550
This can be nothing but gloominess of heart.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.550
Why should I not look gloomy?

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.550
When this city, the place where my forefathers are buried lies in ruins.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.550
And its gates have been consumed by fire.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.550
What is this?

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.550
Speak frankly, what are you seeking?

00:05:53.550 --> 00:06:05.639
At once, I prayed to the God of the heavens if it pleases the king.

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:12.620
And if your servant has found favor with you, send me to Judah,

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.620
to the city where my forefathers are buried, and let me rebuild it.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:25.089
You may go.

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:31.379
Jehovah was with us.

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:38.379
The king gave me supplies, an army, and an appointment as governor.

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:45.980
We were on our way to help rebuild Jerusalem's walls.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:07:40.819
I had seen a portion of the city, but it wasn't until I rose by night to inspect the walls.

00:07:40.819 --> 00:07:44.819
That I saw just how badly God's city had been treated.

00:07:44.819 --> 00:08:19.360
I couldn't believe the destruction.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:33.190
The time had come to reveal Jehovah's purpose for Jerusalem.

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:36.600
I gathered the leaders.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.879
Who is this man?

00:08:39.879 --> 00:08:43.879
I'm told he's Nehemiah, cut bare to the king.

00:08:43.879 --> 00:08:48.669
What does he want from us?

00:08:48.669 --> 00:08:59.139
Men, the holy city is completely vulnerable.

00:08:59.139 --> 00:09:04.139
Let us rebuild the walls of Jerusalem so that this disgrace will not continue.

00:09:04.139 --> 00:09:06.139
But what will our neighbors think?

00:09:06.139 --> 00:09:09.139
We have many powerful enemies.

00:09:09.139 --> 00:09:14.139
Our desertsys commissioned me to rebuild the walls in the entire city.

00:09:14.139 --> 00:09:17.139
Didn't you see the horseman he sent?

00:09:17.139 --> 00:09:21.139
And all the timber, he gave it all.

00:09:21.139 --> 00:09:24.139
Brothers, the good hand of our God was upon me.

00:09:24.139 --> 00:09:27.139
He is the one to fear, not men.

00:09:27.139 --> 00:09:30.139
He will give us success.

00:09:30.139 --> 00:09:41.669
Not everyone was happy that we had come to do something good for the people of Israel.

00:09:41.669 --> 00:09:46.669
So that's what this Nehemiah is up to.

00:09:46.669 --> 00:09:49.669
Geesham, do you see what I'm saying?

00:09:49.669 --> 00:09:53.669
Without a wall, we can keep the Jews under control.

00:09:53.669 --> 00:09:57.669
If they rebuild it, the Jews won't need our land or resources.

00:09:57.669 --> 00:09:59.669
That means he's planning to rebel.

00:09:59.669 --> 00:10:03.110
We can't let him.

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:06.110
We must act and act together.

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:07.110
Are you with me?

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:08.110
You have my support.

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:12.509
And mine, as always.

00:10:12.509 --> 00:10:13.509
Good.

00:10:13.509 --> 00:10:16.509
We must go to Jerusalem to keep an eye on Nehemiah.

00:10:16.509 --> 00:10:25.419
The opposers wanted to maintain control and to profit from Jehovah's people.

00:10:25.419 --> 00:10:28.419
They wasted a little time trying to intimidate us.

00:10:28.419 --> 00:10:36.570
Who are these?

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:40.570
That's Sam Ballet, governor of Samaria.

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:45.570
Next to him is Tobiah, an Ammonite official, landowner to many of our people.

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:47.570
The helicopter.

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:48.570
That's Geesham.

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:52.570
He's a very wealthy Arabian and close ally to Sam Ballet.

00:10:52.570 --> 00:11:06.980
Nehemiah.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:11.419
Are you rebellion against the king?

00:11:11.419 --> 00:11:13.419
The king himself gives us the authority.

00:11:13.419 --> 00:11:15.419
To rebuild the city and the wall?

00:11:15.419 --> 00:11:18.419
To rebuild the city and the wall is what the king expects us to do.

00:11:18.419 --> 00:11:20.419
Why did you not consult with me?

00:11:20.419 --> 00:11:22.419
I am the governor of Samaria.

00:11:22.419 --> 00:11:23.419
Well, yes.

00:11:23.419 --> 00:11:26.419
But the king appointed Nehemiah as governor of Judah.

00:11:26.419 --> 00:11:28.419
So why have you not asked for our help?

00:11:28.419 --> 00:11:30.419
We worship Jehovah too.

00:11:30.419 --> 00:11:32.419
We've sacrificed him for generations.

00:11:32.419 --> 00:11:35.419
Along with sacrifices to all of your other gods.

00:11:35.419 --> 00:11:40.419
The God of the heavens is the one that will grant us success.

00:11:40.419 --> 00:11:43.419
And we his servants, we will get up and build.

00:11:43.419 --> 00:11:49.419
No one should let his religious beliefs come before national unity.

00:11:49.419 --> 00:12:01.940
But you have neither share nor claim nor memorial in Jerusalem.

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:02.940
Sam Ballet.

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:08.409
Could it be you who is rebelling against the highest king of all?

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:19.190
Despite opposition, the people work strenuously.

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:44.019
Their struggles went far beyond building a wall.

00:12:44.019 --> 00:12:47.019
Jehovah remembers brothers like Pilith.

00:12:47.019 --> 00:12:50.019
Seeing how he dealt with personal challenges.

00:12:50.019 --> 00:12:55.669
Strength in my faith.

00:12:55.669 --> 00:12:58.669
Pilith, right here.

00:12:58.669 --> 00:13:00.669
We'll never finish this work.

00:13:00.669 --> 00:13:02.669
It's not about rubble.

00:13:02.669 --> 00:13:04.669
These were trying to make a change.

00:13:04.669 --> 00:13:07.669
Always an optimist.

00:13:07.669 --> 00:13:10.669
By the way, you're late on your rent.

00:13:10.669 --> 00:13:12.669
Again.

00:13:12.669 --> 00:13:14.669
Rayham, I'm sorry.

00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:16.669
I need more time.

00:13:16.669 --> 00:13:17.669
With the work on the wall.

00:13:17.669 --> 00:13:19.669
I have enough troubles.

00:13:19.669 --> 00:13:21.669
Look, if I don't get payment by the end of the month,

00:13:21.669 --> 00:13:23.669
you and your family are out.

00:13:23.669 --> 00:13:28.710
Is there anything we can do?

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:32.500
Maybe I can work it off.

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:33.500
Till we get caught off.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.500
Seriously, you don't have time to work it off.

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:40.940
But maybe your daughter can help.

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:43.940
She can come stay with us.

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:44.940
Is this slave?

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:45.940
No.

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:47.940
I'll hire her to help Azuba.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.940
To pay off your debt.

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:51.940
Look, I'm trying to help.

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:54.940
But you don't have many options to have my friend.

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:55.940
Think about it.

00:13:55.940 --> 00:14:27.450
So, Rayham spoke to me today.

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:28.450
About what?

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:32.450
He wants to hire Simka to help Azuba in the house.

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:37.179
And he says he'll care for her like his own daughter.

00:14:37.179 --> 00:14:42.179
I've known Rayham and Azuba ever since I came here with Ezra.

00:14:42.179 --> 00:14:44.179
Rayham helped us.

00:14:44.179 --> 00:14:46.179
Our house belongs to him.

00:14:46.179 --> 00:14:48.179
I don't trust him.

00:14:48.179 --> 00:14:51.179
He wants our Simka to live with him?

00:14:51.179 --> 00:14:52.179
Yeah.

00:14:52.179 --> 00:14:54.179
What about Jehovah's Command?

00:14:54.179 --> 00:14:56.179
The parents raised their own children.

00:14:56.179 --> 00:14:58.179
Don't you want her to have a better life?

00:14:58.179 --> 00:15:05.899
I cannot agree.

00:15:05.899 --> 00:15:08.899
To having her live apart from us.

00:15:08.899 --> 00:15:10.899
Even if we have to survive on cleanings.

00:15:10.899 --> 00:15:12.899
No, you know we'll survive it all.

00:15:12.899 --> 00:15:18.759
Because Jehovah always takes care of those who love and obey him.

00:15:18.759 --> 00:15:26.019
Men like Pilith, through their burden on Jehovah,

00:15:26.019 --> 00:15:27.019
and kept working.

00:15:27.019 --> 00:15:41.629
Sinballet set up camp near Jerusalem

00:15:41.629 --> 00:15:44.629
to keep an eye on our progress.

00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:53.480
So, what is it?

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:54.480
My lord.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.480
Yes?

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:56.480
The wall.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.480
It's up to half its height all around the city.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.480
This has gone too far.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:05.480
Gisham, how long will it take to assemble an attack force?

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.480
Attack force?

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.480
My lord, Sinballet.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.480
An attack on the Jews.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.480
Being an attack on the king.

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:14.480
What are you talking about?

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.480
He's right.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.480
Nehemiah has authorization from our exercies himself.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.480
You saw how many horsemen the king sent with him.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.480
Yes.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.480
Would you be talking like this if those horsemen were still here?

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:24.480
And they can come back.

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:25.480
Nonsense.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:28.480
Never mind the horsemen.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.480
This is my province.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.480
Out here, I decide what to do.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.480
Now, we need to threaten them.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.480
Gisham, you bring Samaritan troops.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:42.480
They're prepared to attack us.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.480
How do you know that?

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.480
I heard them talking.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.480
Brothers, please.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.480
Have they attacked anyone yet?

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.480
They must have.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.480
They saw something.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.480
Are you gonna wait until they start killing us?

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.480
Of course not.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:03.279
Of course not.

00:17:03.279 --> 00:17:04.279
Henei.

00:17:04.279 --> 00:17:08.069
Postmen by families at the lowest parts of the wall,

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:10.069
at all the exposed places.

00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:13.420
Yes, Nehemiah.

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:17.420
Brothers, if we let mere threats frighten us in a stopping,

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:18.420
they will have achieved their goal.

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:19.420
It's no use.

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:21.420
Don't you see these people hate what we're doing?

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:22.420
They hate us.

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:25.420
You don't have to live and work around them like we do.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.420
Brothers, where is your faith?

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:31.420
It is Jehovah's will that we build this wall.

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:32.420
It is really Jehovah's will,

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:34.420
and why are we getting all this opposition?

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:36.420
Maybe this isn't the right time.

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:39.420
Besides, this work is too much for us.

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:40.420
We're worn out.

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.420
Why do we need a wall anyway?

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:48.480
To protect Jehovah's people.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:57.720
Brothers, do not be afraid of them.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:02.720
Remember Jehovah who is great and awe-inspiring.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:07.380
And fight for your brothers,

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.380
your sons and daughters,

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:17.569
your wives and homes.

00:18:17.569 --> 00:18:20.569
So when you hear the sound of the horn,

00:18:20.569 --> 00:18:23.569
gather together to where we are.

00:18:23.569 --> 00:18:25.569
Our God will fight for us.

00:18:25.569 --> 00:18:29.650
Listen for this signal.

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:40.779
The threats are working.

00:18:40.779 --> 00:18:43.779
Next sound they hear will be our battle cry.

00:18:43.779 --> 00:18:44.779
Wait.

00:18:44.779 --> 00:18:46.779
We already spoke about this.

00:18:46.779 --> 00:18:49.779
A direct attack would be seditious.

00:18:49.779 --> 00:18:51.779
Besides, they've armed themselves.

00:18:51.779 --> 00:18:58.289
Wait.

00:18:58.289 --> 00:19:00.289
I-I-I Lord.

00:19:00.289 --> 00:19:02.289
Keishan's right.

00:19:02.289 --> 00:19:04.289
He would never get away with this.

00:19:04.289 --> 00:19:07.289
Don't you recall who commissioned Nehemiah?

00:19:07.289 --> 00:19:08.289
Was the king.

00:19:08.289 --> 00:19:09.289
The king of Persia?

00:19:09.289 --> 00:19:12.289
Let me remind you.

00:19:12.289 --> 00:19:14.289
Nehemiah setting himself up as a king.

00:19:14.289 --> 00:19:26.470
I recommend you turn the accusation of sedition against Nehemiah.

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:28.470
That's brilliant.

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:30.470
Yes.

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:33.470
People beg for our help.

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:35.470
Let's go back to Samaria.

00:19:35.470 --> 00:20:16.519
You look like you've been working.

00:20:16.519 --> 00:20:18.519
Almost like it, too.

00:20:19.519 --> 00:20:20.519
Yes.

00:20:20.519 --> 00:20:23.990
Yes, you do.

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:26.940
Brothers.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:30.940
Brothers, we are well on our way to completing the wall.

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:32.940
Jehovah's helping us.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:35.940
But we must not let our hands drop.

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:42.309
From now on, we will all spend the night inside Jerusalem.

00:20:42.309 --> 00:20:45.309
We will take turns keeping watch.

00:20:45.309 --> 00:20:48.309
And a night we'll give out assignments.

00:20:48.309 --> 00:20:49.309
Good work today.

00:20:49.309 --> 00:21:37.130
I was working hard on the wall, but there were more issues to contend with.

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:45.339
My brothers, how can I help you?

00:21:45.339 --> 00:21:49.339
Nehemiah, we, with our sons and daughters, are many.

00:21:49.339 --> 00:21:51.339
We need food to stay alive.

00:21:51.339 --> 00:21:59.980
We gave our fields and vineyards and houses as security to get grain during the food shortage.

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:05.980
We borrowed money on our fields and our vineyards to pay the king's tribute.

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:08.980
And we've had to sell some of our children in dislavery.

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:14.980
And we're powerless to stop this, because our fields and vineyards belong to others.

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:19.019
Thank you for bringing this to my attention.

00:22:19.019 --> 00:22:21.019
I must ponder all this.

00:22:21.019 --> 00:22:22.019
Thank you, Nehemiah.

00:22:22.019 --> 00:22:34.009
Haneinah, please tell all the nobles and deputy rulers to come to me first thing tomorrow morning.

00:22:34.009 --> 00:22:52.759
With God's help, we can make this right.

00:22:52.759 --> 00:22:59.039
Men of Judah, each of you is demanding interest from your brother.

00:22:59.039 --> 00:23:02.039
You should be shamed of yourselves.

00:23:02.039 --> 00:23:10.039
Should you not walk in the fear of our God so that the nations, our enemies, cannot reproach us?

00:23:10.039 --> 00:23:14.039
Let us please stop this blending on interest.

00:23:14.039 --> 00:23:23.039
Please restore to them their fields, vineyards, all of groves and houses, and the interest.

00:23:23.039 --> 00:23:29.339
Nehemiah, I will restore the fields.

00:23:29.339 --> 00:23:31.339
This day at sunset.

00:23:31.339 --> 00:23:38.670
We all will restore these things to our brothers.

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:43.670
Before Jehovah, do you swear to these promises?

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:44.670
We do.

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:51.670
May the true God shake out from his house every man who does not carry out this promise.

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:52.670
Amen.

00:23:52.670 --> 00:24:06.190
Michelle, we best inform Tobiah about this.

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:08.190
This will be successful.

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:22.670
Jehovah will bless.

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:24.670
I bring good news.

00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:25.670
Is that so?

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:27.670
Yes.

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:29.670
We have your rent.

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:31.670
All?

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:34.670
Come by any time and collect it.

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:36.670
But I thought we...

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:43.730
I think what about Simka?

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:45.730
She'll be staying with us.

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:49.730
Well, how are you able to put it together so quickly?

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:55.700
Jehovah always takes care of those who love and obey him.

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.700
Ever since Nehemiah got here,

00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:15.220
things have been getting better and better.

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:19.220
Me and my thanks were still as young as when we came here with Ezra.

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:22.569
I've worked hard.

00:25:22.569 --> 00:25:26.569
But now Nehemiah treats us like it all fell out of heaven, and we just have to pick it up.

00:25:26.569 --> 00:25:28.569
I've worked hard for what I have.

00:25:28.569 --> 00:25:29.569
Didn't I?

00:25:29.569 --> 00:25:30.569
Yes, you worked hard.

00:25:30.569 --> 00:25:33.569
If I get back my fields, what am I to eat?

00:25:33.569 --> 00:25:35.569
What am I to drink?

00:25:35.569 --> 00:25:37.569
What's wrong with lending on interest?

00:25:37.569 --> 00:25:40.569
You borrow, you pay, with interest.

00:25:40.569 --> 00:25:43.569
Reham, Jehovah just wants us to treat our brothers fairly.

00:25:43.569 --> 00:25:46.569
Did you hear the word I said? I treat everyone fairly.

00:25:46.569 --> 00:25:53.839
Why are you so angry?

00:25:53.839 --> 00:25:58.240
I'm not angry.

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.240
Why are you talking to me like this?

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.240
I just feel betrayed.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:10.359
By the people I've lent money to.

00:26:10.359 --> 00:26:12.359
What can I do about it?

00:26:12.359 --> 00:26:14.359
Only what a wife is supposed to do?

00:26:14.359 --> 00:26:16.359
Give me a son!

00:26:16.359 --> 00:26:22.299
If not a son, then a daughter.

00:26:22.299 --> 00:26:26.299
I cannot give you, which Jehovah does not give us.

00:26:26.299 --> 00:26:29.299
One day, it will be too late.

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.960
My lord, St. Ballet.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.960
Now what?

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.960
The wall has no more gaps.

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:51.960
What?

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:57.880
How can they advance so quickly?

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:00.880
Also, there's a letter for Tobaya.

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:20.059
Neomaya is forcing landlords to return their fields to the original owners.

00:27:20.059 --> 00:27:22.059
We're running out of time.

00:27:22.059 --> 00:27:29.170
Enough.

00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:32.170
Tell this to Neomaya.

00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:33.170
Come.

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:38.170
And let us set a time to meet together in the valley plain of Ono.

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:50.829
They're trying to lure me away from Jerusalem and of you.

00:27:50.829 --> 00:27:53.829
Please tell your master, I'm engaged in a great work,

00:27:53.829 --> 00:27:55.829
and I'm not able to go down.

00:27:55.829 --> 00:27:59.829
Why should the work stop while I leave it to come to you?

00:27:59.829 --> 00:28:02.829
They sent me the same message several times.

00:28:02.829 --> 00:28:07.369
Each time I gave them the same response.

00:28:07.369 --> 00:28:23.519
He has rejected your offer a fourth time.

00:28:23.519 --> 00:28:27.519
Geesham, it's time to implement your plan.

00:28:27.519 --> 00:28:31.519
Tobaya, write this down.

00:28:31.519 --> 00:28:34.519
Among the nations, it has been heard.

00:28:34.519 --> 00:28:43.519
And Geesham is also saying that you and the Jews are scheming to rebel.

00:28:43.519 --> 00:28:46.519
That is why you are building the wall.

00:28:46.519 --> 00:29:05.859
Yes?

00:29:05.859 --> 00:29:09.140
Give this to Neomaya.

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:35.369
Tell your master, none of the things you are saying have taken place.

00:29:36.369 --> 00:29:39.369
You are making them up out of your own imagination.

00:29:39.369 --> 00:30:02.200
They're bluffing.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.200
They're trying to frighten us in the stopping work.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:09.200
Yes, they know that the king won't change his decree.

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:13.799
But believe me, they won't stop.

00:30:13.799 --> 00:30:43.130
Jehovah, I pray strengthen my hands.

00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:48.460
What can we do to stop them?

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:51.460
We don't have much time.

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:58.660
The wall is almost complete.

00:30:58.660 --> 00:30:59.660
San Ballet.

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:03.349
I think I know a way.

00:31:03.349 --> 00:31:06.349
Shema, are you calling for me?

00:31:06.349 --> 00:31:07.349
Yes.

00:31:07.349 --> 00:31:13.000
You are in great danger.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000
And so am I, because I know about it.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000
Talk sense, man, what danger?

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000
They're coming to kill you.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.000
By night, we must go into the temple and close the doors.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Shema, should a man like me run away?

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.000
You don't understand.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000
No.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000
What would that do to the spirit of the entire nation?

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
It's the only safe place.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
Besides, I'm not a priest.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000
If I entered the temple, that would be valid reason to kill me.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
I will not go in.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:51.559
That decision would be foolish, Shema.

00:31:51.559 --> 00:31:52.559
Oh, I see.

00:31:52.559 --> 00:31:58.559
Tobiah and San Ballet put you up to this dint that you hypocrite.

00:31:58.559 --> 00:32:00.559
May Jehovah remember them.

00:32:00.559 --> 00:32:04.559
And all of you false prophets who keep trying to frighten me.

00:32:04.559 --> 00:32:24.710
Come, Haneini, we have work to do.

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:27.710
We just kept working day and night.

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:32.710
But before we knew it, we were finishing the very last section of the wall.

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:57.569
But helped us to achieve the impossible.

00:32:57.569 --> 00:32:58.569
We were tired.

00:32:58.569 --> 00:33:01.569
But we discovered something we had lost.

00:33:01.569 --> 00:33:41.359
It's from Shemaia.

00:33:41.359 --> 00:33:54.170
What does it say?

00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:56.170
The wall's complete.

00:33:56.170 --> 00:34:00.420
But George are left to be put in.

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:03.420
San Ballet, we must act quickly.

00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:04.420
San Ballet.

00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:06.420
Tobiah.

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:08.420
There's still time.

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:10.420
Write that letter to the people.

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:13.860
Don't you see?

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:20.429
God must be helping the Jews.

00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:22.429
It's over.

00:34:22.429 --> 00:34:24.429
We'll lose all control over them.

00:34:24.429 --> 00:35:21.469
This isn't over.

00:35:21.469 --> 00:35:23.469
Only the beginning.

00:35:23.469 --> 00:35:27.469
We would definitely need God's help for what was coming next.

00:35:27.469 --> 00:35:38.159
Are you now eager to see the conclusion of the drama?

00:35:38.159 --> 00:35:44.159
We will enjoy part two during the final session of this convention.

00:35:44.159 --> 00:35:52.159
The account of Nehemiah teaches us to trust in Jehovah as we carry out our assigned work.

00:35:52.159 --> 00:36:02.159
Throughout this session and the preceding one, we have been focusing on the vital work of making disciples.

00:36:02.159 --> 00:36:04.159
Do you recall the key lessons?

00:36:04.159 --> 00:36:09.159
Also, what disciple-making work do we look forward to in the future?

00:36:09.159 --> 00:36:16.159
Please pay close attention to Brother Stephen led of the governing body as he delivers the talk,

00:36:16.159 --> 00:36:30.030
making disciples now, prepares us for new world disciple-making.

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:36.030
There are many things in life that prepare a person for greater things.

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:42.030
For example, elementary school prepares a student for high school.

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:47.030
Running shorter races prepares a person to run a marathon.

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:54.030
Working as an apprentice prepares a worker to serve as a professional.

00:36:54.030 --> 00:37:02.030
Well, in this talk, we're going to discuss how that disciple-making now prepares us

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:07.030
for the greater disciple-making work in the new world.

00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:14.030
But first, let's briefly discuss how making disciples right now brings a lot of joy.

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:17.030
Please turn to Psalm 105.

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:22.030
Now, this is the theme scripture for today's program.

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:24.030
Psalm 105 verse 3.

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:32.030
Most about His holy name, let the hearts of those seeking Jehovah rejoice.

00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:37.030
Notice, we're encouraged to boast about Jehovah's holy name.

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:39.030
How do we do this?

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:46.030
Well, by preaching, teaching, helping others come to know Jehovah and His purposes.

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:49.030
And what is the result of this?

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:55.030
Well, honest hearted ones respond favorably, and they began to seek Jehovah.

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:57.030
And how are they affected?

00:37:57.030 --> 00:38:04.030
Well, as a second part of that verse read, their hearts overflow with rejoicing.

00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:12.030
Now, taking it a little further, how are we affected when we're able to help someone start seeking Jehovah

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:15.030
and to get on that road to everlasting life?

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:19.030
Well, it makes our hearts rejoice in that true.

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:28.030
And in fact, there are very few things in life that can bring more joy than helping someone start seeking Jehovah

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:31.030
and get on that narrow road to life.

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:35.030
I mean, think about it to explain Bible truth to them.

00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:42.030
See, their face light up as little light bulbs start going off in their mind as they're learning these truths

00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:46.030
to see them start making changes in their life.

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:52.030
To please Jehovah, to see them become an unbaptized publisher, come up from that baptismal pool,

00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:57.030
maybe later get into the pioneer work, there's nothing this world can offer.

00:38:57.030 --> 00:39:07.030
No accomplishment, no paycheck that can equal the joy of helping someone start seeking Jehovah.

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:15.030
Appropriately, throughout this second day of our program, we have been taught many ways.

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:25.030
We can improve in our disciple making skills, because it is vital that we do so, because eternal lives hang in the balance.

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:30.030
And what is the value of one eternal life?

00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:38.030
Well, one brother said, if all of Jehovah's Witnesses pioneered until the end came, and one person learned the truth,

00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:42.030
it would be worth it. That's the value of one life.

00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:48.030
In fact, with all the money, the gold, the silver, the diamonds combined, you could not buy one eternal life.

00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:58.030
It's priceless, but not one, almost 304,000, were helped to the point of baptism during the last service year.

00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:05.030
As a result of Jehovah blessing, the disciple making skills of his people.

00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:18.030
But as we mentioned before, learning disciple making skills now, prepares us for the even greater disciple making work of the New World.

00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:27.030
In fact, let's talk about how vast this work will be, this educational work in the New World.

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:35.030
If we think about it, millions have been made disciples during these last years of the last days.

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:43.030
But in the New World, apparently, billions of disciples will need to be made.

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:46.030
How much greater is a billion than a million?

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:49.030
1,000 times greater!

00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:56.030
So we're talking about thousands of times more disciples needing to be made than now.

00:40:56.030 --> 00:41:07.030
And likely, we will carry on this work of disciple making in the New World for centuries, not just decades as the case in the last days.

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:10.030
And that is really something to think about.

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:17.030
In fact, it makes us think of what Jesus said to his disciples at John 1412.

00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:22.030
He told them, you will do works greater than I am doing.

00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:28.030
So really, we could say that that disciple making work of the New World will be greater.

00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:36.030
More people will be witness to and made disciples a larger area, a longer period of time.

00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:45.030
And undoubtedly, disciple making in the New World will be even more joyful than disciple making now.

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:52.030
Now we said before it's indescribable joy to make a disciple now, but why will it be even more enjoyable?

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:57.030
Well, think about the environment. Satan the devil will be gone.

00:41:57.030 --> 00:42:01.030
That will be like a hundred pound block off all our shoulders.

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:04.030
The spirit of the world will no longer exist.

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:12.030
That spirit of the world exhale by Satan, because Satan will be locked in the abyss, and you could say it will be airtight.

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:16.030
He will not be able to exhale the spirit of the world from there.

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:20.030
One government will rule the entire earth.

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:23.030
All human governments will be gone.

00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:30.030
And think of this, never again, never ever, will the unrighteous outnumber the righteous.

00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:33.030
They will always be the minority.

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:41.030
So this wonderful environment will undoubtedly make disciple making even more exhilarating in the New World.

00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:48.030
But now let's think for a moment about how voluminous the work itself will be.

00:42:48.030 --> 00:43:02.030
John 528 and 29 says that all those in the memorial tombs will hear Jesus voice and come out all in the tombs,

00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:08.030
who will be included among these ones that will come out of the memorial tombs.

00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:12.030
We'll open up to Acts chapter 24.

00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:15.030
And let's notice who will be included.

00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:19.030
Acts 24 verse number 15.

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:30.030
And I have hoped toward God, which hope these men also look forward to, that there is going to be

00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:36.030
a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.

00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:40.030
So you notice it's guaranteed it is going to happen.

00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:49.030
Not maybe good possibility, it's going to happen, and it's going to include the righteous and the unrighteous.

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:51.030
But now here's a question.

00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:57.030
Why will the righteous who are resurrected need further education?

00:43:57.030 --> 00:44:06.030
Well, even though they're already servants of God, they will need to learn details concerning fulfill prophecies,

00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:12.030
the outworking of God's purposes, things that have happened since they died.

00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:16.030
They'll need to be brought up to speed, so to speak.

00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:23.030
And how much they'll need to be taught will depend largely upon how long ago they died.

00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:33.030
They will also need help to continue in their righteous course and to obey the things written in the scrolls.

00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:37.030
Revelation 20 verse 12 talks about these new scrolls.

00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:46.030
It says, I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and scrolls were opened.

00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:52.030
The dead were judged out of those things written in the scrolls according to their deeds.

00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:55.030
And the watchtower said this about those new scrolls.

00:44:55.030 --> 00:45:04.030
It said, these scrolls will most likely set forth Jehovah's requirements for mankind at that time.

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:12.030
By studying these, all people, including resurrected ones, will be able to know God's will for them.

00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:20.030
These scrolls will surely give us further insight into Jehovah's mind.

00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:24.030
That's exciting indeed to ponder, isn't it?

00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:35.030
Included among the righteous, through resurrected, will be fateful ones, who will be brought back to serve as princes.

00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:43.030
Psalm 45-16 says that Jesus will appoint princes in all the earth.

00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:47.030
And the watchtower pointed out that one example would be Daniel.

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:51.030
Do you remember what Jehovah promised him shortly before he died?

00:45:51.030 --> 00:46:00.030
He said, you will rest, but you will stand up for your lot at the end of the days.

00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:12.030
Well, he's rested in the grave for some 2,500 years, but he'll stand up in the resurrection, and he'll take his position as one of these princes as pointed out in the watchtower.

00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:21.030
Now, of course, Daniel and others like him will need to be brought up to speed, updated, trained for their assignments.

00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:36.030
Also, many of the princes will be selected from the fateful elders who are taking the lead today as pointed out by the watchtower, but of course Jesus, the Messianic King, will make the appointments.

00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:38.030
So what do we know?

00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:40.030
They will be good appointments.

00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:50.030
They will be princes who will truly love the people, and fatefully carry out all the directions of the heavenly government.

00:46:51.030 --> 00:47:01.030
Also included, among the righteous to be resurrected, will be many of our loved ones, who may have thought they would live to see the end of this system.

00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:16.030
But they died in the last days, but now what a joy it will be for you brothers and sisters to welcome these ones back and teach them about all the things that have happened since they died.

00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:25.030
They'll need to be brought up to date, so they can help in this great disciple-making work, an example I think of my mother.

00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:29.030
She was baptized in 1938.

00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:33.030
She died in 2012, a little over eight years ago.

00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:43.030
She really wanted to see the end of this system, and she was of that judge, brother for generation, really wanted to see that prostitute destroyed.

00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:46.030
But cancer prevented that from happening.

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:57.030
And I remember shortly before she died, I said, Mom, I know you wanted to go into the New World, the overland passageway, never died all.

00:47:57.030 --> 00:48:01.030
But you're going to have to take the underground tunnel.

00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:10.030
But the main thing is to get there, and you're going to very shortly close your eyes, and the next thing you're going to see, you're going to open your eyes in that New World.

00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:17.030
But when she comes back, just think of the things that have happened in the eight years she's been gone.

00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:20.030
She'll have to be brought up to speed, won't she?

00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:29.030
This is JW Broadcasting from the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:32.030
She didn't even know about the broadcast.

00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:39.030
She'll have to be brought up to speed, but she'll be so happy to learn about this and other developments.

00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:46.030
But here's a question, where will the billions of new disciples come from?

00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:55.030
Even though the resurrected righteous ones will need to be educated, they're already disciples, aren't they?

00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:57.030
So where will the new disciples come from?

00:48:57.030 --> 00:49:01.030
Well, one's born after Armageddon.

00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:03.030
We'll need to be made disciples.

00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:11.030
Also, there'll be a vast multitude of unrighteous ones who will return from the grave.

00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:19.030
Now, they'll come from all different backgrounds, and they'll come back, and they'll need to be taught.

00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:27.030
They'll need help to accept Christ's ransom, to obey the things that are written in the New Scrolls,

00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:29.030
because most of them will know nothing.

00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:40.030
Now, maybe some studied a while, but death prevented them from continuing, but most will know nothing completely unaware about the good news.

00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:56.030
And as we said, they'll come from all time periods, locations, cultures, some may have been rulers, maybe slaves, maybe criminals, maybe self-righteous persons, maybe once died in combat, died in childbirth,

00:49:56.030 --> 00:50:11.030
died of disease, perhaps the coronavirus, died by starvation, natural disaster, and it seems that the last thought on their mind, when they died, will be the first thought when they come back.

00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:18.030
I was thinking about the men who threw the three Hebrews into the fiery furnace, and they died because of the heat.

00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:33.030
They'll come back with a vivid memory of that situation, and yet they'll have to be taught what happened after they died, how those three Hebrews came out, unharmed, see.

00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:38.030
Just imagine all these backgrounds, of ones coming back.

00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:41.030
Imagine situations it could develop.

00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:52.030
Here's just an example. Imagine a former ruler had hundreds, maybe thousands of slaves, who catered to his every desire.

00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:58.030
Now, he comes back in a resurrection, and his overseer is one of his former slaves.

00:50:58.030 --> 00:51:06.030
And he tells him, gives him direction, loving direction, but direction, to plant a tree in a certain location.

00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:14.030
Now, will he humble himself? Interesting, interesting possibilities. Think of the atheists who will be resurrected.

00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:24.030
Here they ate Jehovah's food, they drank his water, they breathed his air, they walked on his ground, never gave him any credit.

00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:30.030
Never acknowledged him at all. Makes us think of the illustration of the pig under the apple tree.

00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:37.030
He gobbled up the apples off the ground, but he never looks up to see where they came from.

00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:47.030
Now, we may not use that illustration with these atheists that come back, but they will have to be helped to see what a selfish life they lived.

00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:55.030
And now, they're going to have to praise Jehovah, acknowledge, give him honor, glory, and worship.

00:51:55.030 --> 00:52:02.030
Will they do so? Well, it will be up to them, but you brothers and sisters will help such ones.

00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:10.030
In fact, let's just ponder, some of these ones will come back by means of some artwork.

00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:23.030
Now, look at the following artwork, please, and it's going to show you people from different time periods, different backgrounds, being taught after they're resurrected.

00:52:23.030 --> 00:54:09.909
And as the artwork displays, try to imagine yourself teaching ones of these various backgrounds.

00:54:09.909 --> 00:54:22.909
And brothers and sisters, that artwork is just a little tiny sampling of ones from various time periods and backgrounds who will return to the land of the living.

00:54:22.909 --> 00:54:33.909
But as we mentioned, Jehovah will empower Jesus to resurrect all of these ones, bringing them back from the memorial tombs.

00:54:33.909 --> 00:54:40.909
They will hear his voice and they will come out. And we know it will be a controlled orderly way.

00:54:40.909 --> 00:54:48.909
See, Jehovah is a God, not of disorder, but a peace, 1 Corinthians 1433.

00:54:48.909 --> 00:54:56.909
He also wants things to take place decently and by arrangement, 1 Corinthians 1440.

00:54:56.909 --> 00:55:03.909
So if they all came back at once, that would be a chaotic population explosion, wouldn't it?

00:55:03.909 --> 00:55:12.909
They couldn't even be taught properly. They couldn't be cared for. We know it will be progressive during the thousand years.

00:55:12.909 --> 00:55:23.909
And as I said this, faithful Christians who died shortly before the end of Satan's system will likely be among the first ones raised.

00:55:23.909 --> 00:55:35.909
We can also expect an early resurrection for the faithful men of old who will serve as princes. We touched on that previously.

00:55:35.909 --> 00:55:46.909
Yes, resurrected ones will have much to learn. And you dear brothers and sisters will have the privilege to help them see.

00:55:46.909 --> 00:55:52.909
They'll need to learn about Jehovah, his qualities, all the wonderful things he's done.

00:55:52.909 --> 00:56:01.909
Many will need to reject false religious ideas that they believed in Satan's world. Here's just an example.

00:56:01.909 --> 00:56:11.909
Imagine one who really believed that all good people go to heaven. But now he's resurrected and he's brought back here to the earth.

00:56:11.909 --> 00:56:17.909
Obviously he'll know that teaching was wrong. But what about other false teachings that he believed?

00:56:17.909 --> 00:56:24.909
Will he change his mind and heart? Will he accept these truths? It'll be up to him.

00:56:24.909 --> 00:56:34.909
You brothers and sisters will help such ones. There will be many others who will come back who will have to abandon their former way of life.

00:56:34.909 --> 00:56:50.909
I was thinking as an example, a homosexual. Now this former homosexual comes back into resurrection and he really thought and he was taught and he came to believe that God accepted him with that lifestyle.

00:56:50.909 --> 00:56:59.909
But now he's going to learn about Jehovah's moral standards and he's going to learn that Jehovah will not lower his standard to accommodate us.

00:56:59.909 --> 00:57:13.909
We have to come up to Jehovah's standard. Will he change? Will he adjust? It'll be up to him. But you brothers and sisters will help such ones to enjoy life eternal.

00:57:13.909 --> 00:57:21.909
All must learn to walk into Jehovah's righteous ways and willingly choose to do so.

00:57:21.909 --> 00:57:40.909
But now what if someone refuses to make the necessary changes? Well the Watchtower commented on that. It said after being given ample time, maybe even a hundred years, to seek God, some will show that they refuse to practice righteousness.

00:57:40.909 --> 00:57:57.909
Justly they will lose life in the New World. As we can see from Isaiah 65, verse 12, which says, and the center will be cursed, even though he is a hundred years of age.

00:57:58.909 --> 00:58:08.909
But we expect this will be the minority, that the majority will be delighted to make the adjustments so they can live in that wonderful New World.

00:58:08.909 --> 00:58:20.909
But I think about what one brother told me concerning his Bible student, his Bible student kept saying, well, you know, how do I know I'm going to like life in the New World?

00:58:20.909 --> 00:58:32.909
How do I know I'm not going to be bored? Well, finally the brother told him he said, well, one thing about it, if you don't like being there, you don't have to stay.

00:58:32.909 --> 00:58:46.909
Now it's kind of humorous, but a lot of truth. A person has to willingly want to be there, make the necessary changes, but we believe the vast majority will be delighted to do so.

00:58:47.909 --> 00:59:05.909
And what a privilege it will be to teach ones in that New World a time when Isaiah 119 will be true, which says the earth will certainly be filled with a knowledge of Jehovah as the waters are covering the sea.

00:59:05.909 --> 00:59:12.909
I mean, think about it. This earth 71% of its surface is covered with water.

00:59:12.909 --> 00:59:23.909
And if you smooth all the land out, sea water would cover the planet earth one and two thirds miles deep. This is a watery planet, isn't it?

00:59:23.909 --> 00:59:34.909
Well, that illustration there in Isaiah just shows how prolific, how widespread, how filthy earth will be with a knowledge of Jehovah at that time.

00:59:34.909 --> 00:59:52.909
And that wonderful knowledge will enable faithful humans to grow to perfection and to sufficiently be equipped to face and pass the final test at the end of the thousand years.

00:59:52.909 --> 01:00:04.909
And the good things that you dear brothers and sisters have learned today, this second day of our program, what you've learned today about helping your Bible students now will help you in the New World.

01:00:04.909 --> 01:00:21.909
As you learn, you learned how to teach your Bible students to feed themselves spiritually, to attend the meetings, to avoid bad associations, to overcome unclean habits, to develop a personal relationship with Jehovah.

01:00:21.909 --> 01:00:29.909
See those very same things you will need to teach these new ones that come back in the resurrection.

01:00:29.909 --> 01:00:42.909
So at this time, let's review some of the good things that we have learned today about disciple making and let's meditate on how these skills will help in the New World.

01:00:42.909 --> 01:00:56.909
In fact, look at this video, please, a brief video that gives us some highlights from our first symposium which was entitled, Improve Your Skills.

01:00:56.909 --> 01:01:07.369
Since there's no death or pain in heaven, where would this promise apply? The earth.

01:01:07.369 --> 01:01:10.369
Would you like to learn how to be part of that future?

01:01:10.369 --> 01:01:15.369
If these are God's promises, wouldn't it make sense to go to His Word to find out how to enjoy them?

01:01:15.369 --> 01:01:17.369
Maybe we can think of it this way.

01:01:17.369 --> 01:01:21.369
When parents with a severe genetic defect have children, what happens?

01:01:21.369 --> 01:01:23.369
I get it.

01:01:23.369 --> 01:01:28.369
No study's perfect. She's making some effort. Focus on that.

01:01:28.369 --> 01:01:33.369
If anyone's infusual as a miscontagious, it's yours.

01:01:33.369 --> 01:01:36.369
I can help if you want.

01:01:36.369 --> 01:01:39.369
The real question is, do you trust Him?

01:01:39.369 --> 01:01:43.369
I won't do. I really do.

01:01:43.369 --> 01:01:54.139
As we saw in that video, we want to improve our skills.

01:01:54.139 --> 01:02:00.139
And in the symposium, we saw six areas in which we can improve our skills.

01:02:00.139 --> 01:02:05.139
And each one of the six videos in that symposium discuss one of those skills.

01:02:05.139 --> 01:02:19.139
In review, Nita in the first video, the Bible study conductor, use questions to help the interested person see the practical value of the Bible.

01:02:19.139 --> 01:02:32.139
In the second video, next time they met, Nita unleashed the power of God's Word by showing her student scriptures that highlight our spiritual need.

01:02:32.139 --> 01:02:43.139
In the third video, Nita illustrated a damaged sin by likening it to inherited illness.

01:02:43.139 --> 01:02:53.139
In the fourth video, when our Bible students seem to be losing interest, Nita learned the importance of enthusiasm to motivate.

01:02:53.139 --> 01:03:03.139
In the fifth video, Nita showed empathy for her student's stressful circumstances and provided practical help.

01:03:03.139 --> 01:03:21.139
And then in the last, the sixth video, Nita's conviction and scriptural reasoning helped to reach her student's heart so that she reconsidered her situation and her views on morals.

01:03:21.139 --> 01:03:26.139
Can you just imagine how those six skills you'll use in the New World?

01:03:26.139 --> 01:03:29.139
Think about it. You'll use questions, won't you?

01:03:29.139 --> 01:03:36.139
You'll use questions to help resurrected ones see the practical value of the Bible and the new scrolls.

01:03:36.139 --> 01:03:39.139
And by the way, the Bible will be used in the New World.

01:03:39.139 --> 01:03:48.139
You will unleash the power of God's Word and the power of the scrolls by showing these new one's scriptures.

01:03:48.139 --> 01:03:52.139
You will use good illustrations to help them reason.

01:03:52.139 --> 01:03:56.139
You will use enthusiasm to motivate.

01:03:56.139 --> 01:04:07.139
You will show empathy, especially for ones who have scars as a result of a horrible life in Satan's Old World.

01:04:07.139 --> 01:04:15.139
You will also use conviction and scriptural reasoning to reach their heart.

01:04:16.139 --> 01:04:19.139
But now let's move to our second symposium.

01:04:19.139 --> 01:04:22.139
And it was entitled, Accept Jehovah's Help.

01:04:22.139 --> 01:04:25.139
And we discussed three aids Jehovah gives us.

01:04:25.139 --> 01:04:30.139
Let's look at this brief video that will remind us of that second symposium.

01:04:30.139 --> 01:04:36.420
Her real issue was getting to know someone she can't see.

01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:39.420
Maybe that's the best place to begin.

01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:42.420
I did some research and I think you really like what I found.

01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:46.500
Come, come, sit down.

01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:49.500
I've tried everything to get Jane to a meeting.

01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:52.500
Have you tried bringing other people on the study?

01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:54.500
You were in a band.

01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:56.500
I love that song.

01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:58.500
I actually have that vinyl.

01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:00.500
Look, I know you're busy.

01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:02.500
I have no clue, do you?

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:04.500
I've got to go.

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:07.500
So I asked him to help Jane.

01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:14.179
Then left it with him.

01:05:14.179 --> 01:05:19.179
Well as reminded in that video, Jehovah provides research tools.

01:05:19.179 --> 01:05:22.179
He provides the brotherhood.

01:05:22.179 --> 01:05:25.179
And he provides help by means of prayer.

01:05:25.179 --> 01:05:29.179
And you'll use those things in the new world, obviously.

01:05:29.179 --> 01:05:37.179
See, just like Anita, she used research tools to prepare to discuss evolution with her student.

01:05:37.179 --> 01:05:41.179
When she realized she had limited understanding of the student's background,

01:05:41.179 --> 01:05:44.179
she sought help from the brotherhood.

01:05:44.179 --> 01:05:50.179
She brought along a publisher who had a similar background to her student.

01:05:50.179 --> 01:05:54.179
And that third video, when her student resisted,

01:05:54.179 --> 01:05:58.179
Anita's encouragement to prepare for her Bible study,

01:05:58.179 --> 01:06:04.179
Anita prayed to Jehovah to help her and to motivate the student.

01:06:04.179 --> 01:06:07.179
And you know, Jehovah hears prayers.

01:06:07.179 --> 01:06:10.179
But imagine you'll use research tools.

01:06:10.179 --> 01:06:12.179
You'll use the brotherhood.

01:06:12.179 --> 01:06:17.179
You'll use prayer to make disciples in the new world.

01:06:17.179 --> 01:06:20.179
But now let's go to that third symposium.

01:06:20.179 --> 01:06:23.179
Help your Bible students too.

01:06:23.179 --> 01:06:27.179
And we talked about five things we wanted to help them to do.

01:06:27.179 --> 01:06:34.179
Let's look at this video, which will remind us of that third symposium.

01:06:34.179 --> 01:06:37.179
Which do you remember more from our studies?

01:06:37.179 --> 01:06:41.179
All the things that touch your heart.

01:06:41.179 --> 01:06:45.179
It's asking how Jehovah feels about something.

01:06:45.179 --> 01:06:48.179
And then what that means for me.

01:06:48.179 --> 01:06:50.179
My meeting part tonight covers that point.

01:06:50.179 --> 01:06:52.179
Why don't you come?

01:06:52.179 --> 01:06:55.179
I'm having some people over this weekend.

01:06:55.179 --> 01:06:57.179
It wasn't the club.

01:06:57.179 --> 01:06:59.179
But it was still fun.

01:06:59.179 --> 01:07:02.179
Eating it felt impossible.

01:07:02.179 --> 01:07:06.179
Being made new in your dominant mental attitude.

01:07:06.179 --> 01:07:08.179
I remember one of the Psalms.

01:07:08.179 --> 01:07:10.179
I will walk in your truth.

01:07:10.179 --> 01:07:16.760
Unify my heart to fear your name.

01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:22.760
Well as reminded, there are five things we want to help our students to accomplish.

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:25.760
That first video in this symposium.

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:30.760
Anita helped her student learn to feed herself spiritually.

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:35.760
By demonstrating how she herself prepared for their study.

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:40.760
The second video, Anita returned to the subject of meeting attendance

01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:47.760
by pointing out that the next meeting would consider a question she had raised previously.

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:50.760
The third video.

01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:58.760
Anita helped her student to seek good association by arranging for her to attend a Christian gathering.

01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:04.760
Then the fourth video, when it became clear that the student was not ready to be a publisher

01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:13.760
because of an unclean practice, Anita gently helped her to appreciate what it means to become

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:17.760
and remain clean in Jehovah's eyes.

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:22.760
And then the last video that's fifth one most important.

01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:29.760
Anita helped her student to develop strong love for Jehovah that would be so strong

01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:33.760
she would be able to resist pressure from the world.

01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:38.760
Well, you can imagine you'll use the very same skills.

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:44.760
You'll try to help your students there to accomplish the same five things we discussed.

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:47.760
You'll help them to learn to feed themselves spiritually.

01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:50.760
You'll help them to attend meetings.

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:53.760
You'll help them to see the need to seek out good association,

01:08:53.760 --> 01:09:02.760
to avoid unclean practices and most importantly to develop deep love for Jehovah.

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:11.760
Yes, it's obvious that our skills, our experience, our qualities,

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:17.760
learn now in the disciple making work will be very valuable in the new world.

01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:21.760
You'll be able to put these skills to good use then, see?

01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:26.760
So let's all strive to improve as teachers.

01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:33.760
And that's what Titus 1.9 says that we should hold firmly to the faithful word

01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:37.760
as respects our art of teaching.

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:40.760
And we want to be artists, the art of teaching.

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:45.760
You may have heard the difference between a laborer, a craftsman, and an artist.

01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:48.760
A laborer uses his back.

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:53.760
A craftsman has to add his mind, but an artist adds his heart.

01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:57.760
We don't want to be just laborers, craftsmen, but artists,

01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:00.760
really putting our heart into the disciple making work.

01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:02.760
And it does take effort.

01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:04.760
Let's look at one last scripture here.

01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:06.760
1 Timothy chapter 4.

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:10.760
The effort involved, but it's worth the effort.

01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:13.760
1 Timothy 4 verse 15.

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:16.760
Ponder over these things.

01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:22.760
Be absorbed in them so that your advancement may be plainly seen

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.760
by all people.

01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:28.760
Pay constant attention to yourself and your teaching.

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:31.760
Persevere in these things.

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:37.760
For by doing this, you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:39.760
That's true now.

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:42.760
It will be true in the new world.

01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:45.760
And Jehovah is providing what we need.

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:47.760
He's giving us excellent training.

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:49.760
He provides excellent tools.

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:53.760
We want to make good use of both of these provisions,

01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:56.760
but we do want to give this caution.

01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:58.760
Don't be overwhelmed, please.

01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:01.760
We've discussed a lot of skills, a lot of suggestions,

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:03.760
but don't be overwhelmed.

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:05.760
Jehovah's going to help you.

01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:08.760
He will bless your efforts to do your best.

01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:12.760
And we encourage you to just pick out one or two skills at first.

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:13.760
And work on those.

01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:17.760
And then you can move on to other things.

01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:20.760
In conclusion, think about this,

01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:24.760
there are many secular skills practiced today

01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:28.760
that will not even exist in the new world.

01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:34.760
Doctors, no doctors, nurses, optometrist, undertakers,

01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:37.760
locksmiths, lawyers.

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:41.760
Such professions will not even exist.

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:44.760
But your skills, as a disciple maker,

01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:47.760
will be in high demand.

01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:51.760
You will be able to use these skills to the full.

01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:56.760
And you will definitely rejoice greatly

01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:00.760
as you share in this voluminous,

01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:05.760
this enormous new world educational campaign

01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:08.760
soon to come.

01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:13.229
Thank you, Brother Let, for that exciting preview

01:12:13.229 --> 01:12:17.229
of the work that lies ahead of us.

01:12:17.229 --> 01:12:20.229
This program has highlighted the joy we can find

01:12:20.229 --> 01:12:23.229
in making disciples.

01:12:23.229 --> 01:12:27.229
What can we look forward to in the next two sessions?

01:12:27.229 --> 01:12:31.229
The Scripture theme for those sessions is taken from Psalm 37-4,

01:12:31.229 --> 01:12:35.229
which says, Find exquisite delight in Jehovah

01:12:35.229 --> 01:12:39.229
and He will grant you the desires of your heart.

01:12:39.229 --> 01:12:43.960
The next session begins with a symposium

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:46.960
that will show how we can imitate the Apostle Paul

01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:51.960
and others by rejoicing in all circumstances.

01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:53.960
In the final session,

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:57.960
we will enjoy the conclusion of the Nehemiah drama

01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:01.960
followed by an uplifting closing talk.

01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:04.960
Now, let all inattentance stand

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:09.960
if you are able to do so and sing together song number 140.

01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:13.960
This song invites us to imagine our future joy.

01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:19.960
It is entitled Life Without End at Last.

01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:24.960
After the song, you may have your local concluding prayer.

01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:28.960
Again, that song number 140.
