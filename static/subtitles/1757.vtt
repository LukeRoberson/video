00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.099
My name is Cecil Joseph Goff.

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:10.099
I begin to lose, I say, in the seventies, I can't see to read anything.

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.099
I see on a peripheral vision.

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.100
I was playing in a country band at very young age.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.100
Well, I played the Ten of Bancho, Ten of Guitar, and I played the mandolin.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.100
It was my life.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.100
And yet, when I began reading and studying really,

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.100
I wanted to stick with that, and I left the band.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.100
I started pioneering, and then they assigned me to Texas.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.100
I and another brother was stopped as we were holding the phonograph up,

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.100
and I was playing it for a lady at the door.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.100
I hear about 15 or 20 men surrounded me.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.100
I asked him, I had did you enjoy it?

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.100
He says, that's not the question.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.100
My question is, do you salute the flag?

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.100
And I said, let me explain you, so I don't want an explanation.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.099
I just want to know, yes or no.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:07.099
Do you or do you not?

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:09.099
I said, I do not.

00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:13.099
He threw me up in there, I fell on my back in the street there,

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:15.099
and then about three of them got on top of me,

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:18.099
and says, you're going to salute the flag or eat it.

00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:20.099
Bring me that flag over there.

00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:23.099
I was praying to Jehovah to remember me in the resurrection,

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:27.099
but at that time several women run out of the houses on both sides of us

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:29.099
and let those men alone.

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:33.099
They didn't bother you, let them alone, let them go.

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:37.099
So they got off of me and they left us like a bunch of beaten kittens.

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:40.099
I was asked to go to Brooklyn, Bethel,

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:42.099
and become a member of the Bethel home.

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:45.099
Brother Norr asked me, you know how to use the typewriter,

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:47.099
and I said, yes, I can type.

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:50.099
He says, well, I'm going to put you on a machine.

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:52.099
It's called a line of type.

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:55.099
There's three keyboards, and he says,

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:57.099
it'll take you about two years to learn it.

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:58.099
Are you willing to accept it?

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:00.099
And I said, yes, I will.

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:03.099
So I was put on the line of the type.

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:07.099
And I got married in the fall of 1945, left Bethel.

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:13.099
Well, we were invited in 1949 to go into the circuit work.

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.099
We were in the 21st class of Gillard,

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.099
who enjoyed that course very much.

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.099
We received an assignment for Cuba,

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.099
and I was assigned as a branch overseer.

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.099
And in 1963,

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:31.099
the police car came up to the branch about 10 o'clock at night.

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.099
I was told to take my papers,

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.099
and we went over to the police station, so forth.

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.099
And sure enough, soon thereafter,

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.099
here come in an official,

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.099
said you were having to leave Cuba,

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.099
because you're not in favor of the Cuban government.

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.099
The person asked,

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.099
a policeman standing close by,

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:51.099
this says,

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.099
who are these people that are being sent out of the country?

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.099
And this says, over there,

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.099
he's talking about me.

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:00.099
See that gangster man over there?

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.099
He's ahead of it.

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.099
So what then, we got on the plane,

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:05.099
and we headed back,

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.099
a guy didn't contact with Brooklyn Bethel.

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:09.099
He talked to brother and sister,

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:10.099
and he says,

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:11.099
as soon as you can,

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:12.099
next day or two,

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:13.099
come back to Bethel.

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:14.099
Brother Norris said,

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.099
you got back just in time

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.099
to get back on the landing time machine,

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:21.099
and set up a new book we have in Spanish.

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:25.099
So I did that, he got on the landing time.

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.099
And then, Brother Norris told Mrs.

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:29.099
in 1964,

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.099
we're going to have a 10-month course in Gillian,

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:35.099
for all branch people who had branch experience.

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.099
Oh, it was very, very good.

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:39.099
We studied a lot of,

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:40.099
not only the Bible,

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:41.099
we studied a lot on the Bible,

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.099
discourses and everything.

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.099
But we studied a lot of branch material too.

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.099
Above everything else,

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:51.099
our lover, Jehovah,

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:53.099
should continue to grow.

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.099
He knows our thoughts,

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:56.099
our mind, our heart.

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.099
He goes far beyond what man can do.

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.099
And whatever his decision is,

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:02.099
I've learned to understand,

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.099
it's the best decision.

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.099
I have learned that if we obey

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:08.099
what the organization says,

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.099
what the Bible says,

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:12.099
then we're doing Jehovah's will.

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.099
And that's my concern.

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.100
No regret.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.100
It's whatever.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.100
None.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.100
Maybe I could have done more at times.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.100
But I'm certainly glad that I have taken advantage of it,

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.100
as much as I have of them now.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.100
And it's been a happy life.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.100
And I have seen Jehovah's hand,

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.100
timing again.
