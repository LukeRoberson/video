00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.400
I've been working with the program for seven years.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.400
Almost without exception, these men do come from violent backgrounds.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.539
That's why they're in this facility.

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:20.539
For you to rise above that, in that environment is formidable.

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:26.100
The building was built in the forties.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.100
It's a lot of cold steel and cinder block.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:36.880
When I walk through the prison halls, the floors are cold, they're concrete,

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.880
and it's a little depressing.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.880
But in the company of those men that are trying to apply Bible principles,

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.880
it's actually a very warm and inviting group of people to be with.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.880
When you see them start to study and the kind of person they are,

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.880
angry, and then over time, they start to change,

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.880
and they start to view the other men in the group as their brother.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.880
It is remarkable.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.879
It's conducted just like any other meeting outside.

00:01:07.879 --> 00:01:10.879
They're able to raise their hand and express themselves

00:01:10.879 --> 00:01:13.879
and share with the group what they've learned.

00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:16.879
The end result is that it's a very encouraging session.

00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:19.879
It's spiritually up building.

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:22.879
Many of the officers do appreciate the work we do

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:24.879
because they do see a change in the men.

00:01:24.879 --> 00:01:26.879
They see them wear ties to the meeting.

00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:28.879
No one wears ties in the prison.

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:33.879
They do not use the language that is very common among prisoners.

00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:39.510
Perhaps the most dramatic change is in the personality.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:47.510
To see them become peace-loving and to not respond with violence is very impressive.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:55.900
Robert is still fairly new to this whole program,

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.900
but he's made a tremendous amount of progress.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.900
He is a formidable man. He's a big man.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.900
He tended to be extremely aggressive in the way that he dealt with others.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.900
I have seen a change in him, his personality.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.900
Those bad traits, they were there, and they still are.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.900
They don't go away, but you learn to control it.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.900
You learn not to let it get the best of you

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.900
because you're trying to show Jehovah that you really want his help.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.900
God's work can penetrate all the way through us and transform us and changes.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.900
When we learn about what Jehovah wants of us and how he wants to help us,

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.900
it softens your heart because you want to try to live up to what he wants, not what you were.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.060
Once these men acquire a bit of knowledge,

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.060
they share it with their fellow inmates.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.060
Where do we always refer to if we're trying to run?

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.060
I'll go to the scripture and go right to the source.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.060
Just to see it in someone's eye when they hear the truth and they grab it,

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.060
grab the fact that what they were told was a lie and then it's been corrected

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.060
and they see it from God's word and it means something to them,

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.060
then that's the best reward that you can have.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:25.270
A lot of these prisons are in our backyard and there's a tremendous need.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.270
Jehovah's Witnesses are all about education and improving oneself.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.840
When you see the progress that the men make

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.840
and you see how the application of Bible principles

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.840
makes them better people, makes them happier people.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.840
That's the most important work a person could do.
