00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:11.199
Dear brothers and sisters, welcome to this 2021 Powerful by Faith Convention of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:21.199
And let me begin by extending to all of you the warm Christian love and greetings from the governing body and the United States Bethel family.

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:27.199
And let me assure you that we continue to pray on your behalf.

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:35.200
Powerful by Faith. What a motivating, what an encouraging theme for this convention.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.200
What are we going to learn?

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.200
Well, we're going to concentrate on answering three questions at this convention.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.200
The first one is, what is faith?

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.200
The second one is, what can faith do for us?

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.200
And the third is, how can we build our faith?

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:05.200
Well, it's appropriate since this is the introduction to the convention for us to spend some time talking about each one of those questions.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.200
So let's begin with that first question. What is faith?

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.200
Now, brothers and sisters, we know that faith is something that is produced in us by God's Holy Spirit.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:24.200
In fact, Galatians chapter 5 says that faith is a part of the fruitage of God's Holy Spirit.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.200
So if we have God's Spirit, we will have faith.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.200
But what exactly is faith?

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:39.200
Well, let's go in our Bibles. Let's see the definition the Bible gives in Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 1.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.200
Would you read it with me?

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.200
Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 1 says,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:55.200
Faith is the assured expectation of what is hoped for, the evident demonstration of realities that are not seen.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:02.200
Now, you'll notice the definition of faith is given in two parts. What is the first part?

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:09.199
Well, first it says, faith is the assured expectation of what is hoped for.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.199
Well, what is that mean?

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:18.199
Well, faith is the conviction that we will have the things that we hope for.

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:20.199
Maybe we can illustrate it this way.

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:27.199
You know, it's like the conviction we have when we go to bed at night that the sun is going to rise in the morning.

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:35.199
It's the conviction that the farmer has when he saw his seed that those seeds are going to sprout and they're going to grow.

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:44.199
Faith makes future things promised by God as real as if we already have them now.

00:02:44.199 --> 00:03:00.199
That means that the person with faith firmly believes that everything that Jehovah says is true and that all of the promises that Jehovah has made are going to come to reality.

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:03.199
But now, what's the second part of that definition?

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:10.199
Faith is the evident demonstration of realities that are not seen.

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:12.199
Hmm, what does that mean?

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:17.199
Well, maybe we could illustrate it with something simple like this cell phone.

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:26.199
Now, if you have a cell phone and you have cell phone service, then wherever you may be on the earth, I could call you right now.

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:32.199
But now, there are no wires attached to this phone. How could that possibly work?

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:37.199
Well, of course, we know that this technology relies on radio waves.

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:41.199
Now, you and I can't see radio waves.

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:54.199
But every time we make a call on our cell phones, we see the evidence or the evident demonstration that radio waves are real, even though we cannot see them.

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:56.199
What's the point?

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:09.199
If we really have faith, it means that we can believe in something that is verified by strong evidence even though it is unseen.

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:15.199
Well, that means that faith, as described in the Bible, is not unquestioning.

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:19.199
It is not irrational. It is not foolish or gullible.

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:25.199
It is not being quick to believe something with little or no evidence.

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:34.199
True faith comes from a careful analysis and study of God's precious word, the Bible.

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:40.199
The accurate knowledge that we gain from God's word helps us to build our faith.

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:44.199
It's there in the Bible that we learn about God.

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:49.199
We learn about His name. We learn about His promises that have already come true.

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:56.199
And we learn about promises that He's made, exciting promises for our future.

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:01.199
But faith is also built and established by something else. What is that?

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.199
Well, it's the creation.

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:09.199
When we look up into the night sky and we see the exact order in the universe.

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:17.199
How does it make us feel? Or when we look at the human brain and its complexity or the complexity of the human eye,

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:23.199
we have to come to the conclusion that there must be a designer.

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:28.199
There is strong evidence for an intelligent creator.

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:36.199
Well, now, why is it so important that you and I grow in our faith and develop faith?

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:39.199
Well, the Bible answers that question too.

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:43.199
Would you look with me at Hebrews 11 and verse 6?

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:46.199
Hebrews 11 and 6. It says,

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:51.199
moreover, without faith, it is impossible. Isn't that interesting?

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:59.199
It is impossible to please God well for whoever approaches God must believe that He is

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:05.199
and that He becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking Him.

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:11.199
Well, did you see the point? Without faith, it is impossible to please God.

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:17.199
So faith is essential if we are going to please God and have His blessing.

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:20.199
Well, we've talked quite a bit about what faith is.

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:24.199
But here are two things that faith is not.

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:29.199
Faith is not simply believing that God exists because the Bible says

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:34.199
even the demons believe in God, but they shudder.

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:37.199
It involves coming to know Jehovah,

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:43.199
coming to trust Him, forming an unbreakable friendship with Him

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:49.199
so that Jehovah is so real to us that we sense His love

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:53.199
and sense His approval in our day-to-day life.

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:56.199
What's the other thing that faith is not?

00:06:56.199 --> 00:07:00.199
Faith is not simply hoping for something.

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:03.199
The Bible uses the example of Abraham.

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:09.199
Now, Abraham had the demonstration of the things that he hoped for.

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:12.199
He had evidence that God was real.

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:15.199
But how did that affect Abraham? What was the result?

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:18.199
Let's read together this important scripture,

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:23.199
Romans chapter 4 and verse 20.

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:26.199
Romans chapter 4 and verse 20.

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:27.199
It says,

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:30.199
But because of the promise of God,

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:36.199
He, that is Abraham, did not waver in a lack of faith.

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:38.199
But notice what did He do?

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:44.199
He became powerful by faith, giving God glory.

00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:47.199
You see, Abraham was moved.

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:50.199
He was motivated. He was empowered.

00:07:50.199 --> 00:07:55.199
He became powerful by His faith.

00:07:55.199 --> 00:08:01.199
Well, how appropriately then that Romans chapter 4 and verse 20

00:08:01.199 --> 00:08:06.199
has been chosen as the theme text for this convention.

00:08:06.199 --> 00:08:11.199
Now, in a moment, we are going to talk about the power of faith.

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:15.199
But before we do, we have a wonderful treat now.

00:08:15.199 --> 00:08:19.199
Please give your attention to a recorded message from our dear brother,

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:22.199
Jeffrey Jackson of the governing body,

00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:27.199
as he explains to us how important faith is for Christians today.

00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:45.500
Welcome to the powerful by faith convention of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:51.500
You'll certainly be happy that you made the effort to attend all three days of this convention.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:55.500
The expression, powerful by faith,

00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:01.500
is drawn from the Apostle Paul's words at Romans chapter 4 and verse 20.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:07.500
Why did the governing body choose faith as the theme for this year's convention?

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:13.500
Because we need strong faith to deal successfully with our present trials

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:17.500
and with those we'll face in the near future.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:25.500
At Matthew chapter 17 and verse 20, Jesus assured His disciples.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.500
If you have faith, the size of a mustard grain,

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:34.500
you will say to this mountain, move from here to there,

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:39.500
and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:46.500
Yes, faith enables us to do things we could never imagine doing on our own.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:51.500
For Christians, faith is essential.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:55.500
In fact, God commands us to have faith.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:00.500
At first, John chapter 3 and verse 23, we read,

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:08.500
Indeed, this is His commandment that we have faith in the name of His Son, Jesus Christ,

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:13.500
and love one another just as He gave us a commandment.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:18.500
And Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 6 tells us,

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:23.500
Without faith, it is impossible to please God well.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:28.500
For whoever approaches God must believe that He is,

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:33.500
and that He becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking Him.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:40.500
Clearly, to receive Jehovah's blessing and gain the reward of everlasting life,

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:45.500
we need to build and maintain faith.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:51.500
At Romans chapter 1 verse 17, quoting the prophet Habakkuk,

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:52.500
Paul wrote,

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:58.500
The righteous one will live by reason of faith.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:06.500
With these words, Paul emphasized that Jehovah will reward all who show real faith.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:11.500
Based on our faith in Jesus' ransom, Jehovah forgives our sins,

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:15.500
and grants us a righteous standing with Him even now.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:20.500
And during Armageddon, Jehovah will protect God's people,

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:25.500
and then give them the opportunity to live forever in paradise.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.500
That's what we want for all of you.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:33.500
Most of us here today already have a large measure of faith,

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:38.500
and as Paul wrote at 2 Corinthians chapter 1 and verse 24,

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:43.500
It is by your faith that you are standing.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:48.500
Reports from around the globe testify to your genuine faith

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:54.500
and the good that Jehovah is accomplishing through you because of your faith.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:12:01.500
We feel as Paul expressed a Colossians chapter 1 and verses 3 and 4.

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:09.500
We always thank God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ when we pray for you,

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:17.500
since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and the love you have for all the holy ones.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:24.500
But constant pressure from Satan and the demons, the old world and our own imperfections,

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:28.500
can weaken and wear down our faith.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:33.500
The purpose of this convention is to strengthen that faith.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:39.500
We'll learn how to cultivate true faith, how to exercise it in our daily lives,

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:43.500
and how to maintain it during difficult times.

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:49.500
So please, pay close attention to each part of the program.

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:53.500
As scriptures are read, follow along in the Bible,

00:12:53.500 --> 00:13:00.500
and may God's Word empower you to be a man, woman or child of faith.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:05.899
Thank you so much, Brother Jackson.

00:13:05.899 --> 00:13:08.899
Well, let's come back now to the point we were discussing.

00:13:08.899 --> 00:13:12.899
What is the power of faith?

00:13:12.899 --> 00:13:19.899
Well, now to open this discussion, let's open our Bibles and let's go to Matthew chapter 17

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:23.899
and let's read together verses 19 and 20.

00:13:23.899 --> 00:13:28.899
That's Matthew 17, verses 19 and 20.

00:13:28.899 --> 00:13:32.899
Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said,

00:13:32.899 --> 00:13:35.899
Why could we not expel it?

00:13:35.899 --> 00:13:41.899
He said to them, Because of your little faith, for truly I say to you,

00:13:41.899 --> 00:13:46.899
If you have the faith, the size of a mustard grain,

00:13:46.899 --> 00:13:51.899
you will say to this mountain, move from here to there.

00:13:51.899 --> 00:13:58.899
And it will move and nothing will be impossible for you.

00:13:58.899 --> 00:14:03.899
Wow, Jesus said that faith is powerful.

00:14:03.899 --> 00:14:08.899
He said nothing will be impossible for you.

00:14:08.899 --> 00:14:11.899
Well, just as Peter, because of his faith,

00:14:11.899 --> 00:14:14.899
was able to get out of the boat and walk on the water,

00:14:14.899 --> 00:14:19.899
our faith can enable us to do things that from a human perspective

00:14:19.899 --> 00:14:23.899
seemed to be completely impossible.

00:14:23.899 --> 00:14:27.899
Let's consider six different things.

00:14:27.899 --> 00:14:29.899
Here's the first one.

00:14:29.899 --> 00:14:34.899
Faith opens up the privilege of being able to walk

00:14:34.899 --> 00:14:38.899
with our wonderful amazing God, Jehovah.

00:14:38.899 --> 00:14:40.899
Well, now what does that mean?

00:14:40.899 --> 00:14:46.899
Well, the Bible says men of faith like Noah walked with the true God,

00:14:46.899 --> 00:14:49.899
but what does it mean when it says that?

00:14:49.899 --> 00:14:56.899
Well, Noah followed Jehovah's commandments and instructions so carefully,

00:14:56.899 --> 00:15:04.899
and Noah loved Jehovah so much that it was just as though Noah and Jehovah

00:15:04.899 --> 00:15:11.899
were walking down the street together as the closest and most intimate of friends.

00:15:11.899 --> 00:15:16.899
That is something that faith made possible for Noah.

00:15:16.899 --> 00:15:21.899
But brothers and sisters, here's the really wonderful and amazing thing.

00:15:21.899 --> 00:15:26.899
That was true for Noah, but it's also true for you,

00:15:26.899 --> 00:15:28.899
and it's also true for me.

00:15:28.899 --> 00:15:34.899
We too can experience what seems impossible to be actually walking

00:15:34.899 --> 00:15:37.899
with our Heavenly Father day by day.

00:15:37.899 --> 00:15:40.899
That is the power of faith.

00:15:40.899 --> 00:15:43.899
Let's look at a second one.

00:15:43.899 --> 00:15:49.899
Faith moves us to obey the commands of God without hesitation.

00:15:49.899 --> 00:15:52.899
Now, as an example, we think of Abraham.

00:15:52.899 --> 00:15:57.899
He's called in the Scriptures the Father of all those having faith.

00:15:57.899 --> 00:16:00.899
Now, how is Abraham an example?

00:16:00.899 --> 00:16:06.899
Well, he was quick to obey Jehovah even when Jehovah asked him to do things

00:16:06.899 --> 00:16:13.899
that were very difficult, like leaving her and offering up his only son.

00:16:13.899 --> 00:16:18.899
Abraham was willing to obey because of his faith.

00:16:18.899 --> 00:16:20.899
But now, brothers, think.

00:16:20.899 --> 00:16:24.899
Think about what this makes possible today.

00:16:24.899 --> 00:16:33.899
People who have been addicted to drugs, to tobacco, to alcohol, to gambling, to pornography,

00:16:33.899 --> 00:16:38.899
people who have been living immoral lifestyles of all sorts, people who said

00:16:38.899 --> 00:16:41.899
they would never be able to give up those habits.

00:16:41.899 --> 00:16:46.899
They would never be able to change their lifestyle, but what happened?

00:16:46.899 --> 00:16:51.899
As they developed faith through their faith, through their desire to please Jehovah,

00:16:51.899 --> 00:16:56.899
they broke free from all of those things.

00:16:56.899 --> 00:16:58.899
We have seen people like that.

00:16:58.899 --> 00:17:01.899
You have seen them. I have seen them.

00:17:01.899 --> 00:17:09.900
We know that people like this have conquered all of these bad things because of their faith.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:18.900
Maybe you are one of those people, brothers and sisters, that is the real power of faith.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:26.900
Not something theoretical, not something imagined, but in action, people experience that power

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.900
in their own lives.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.900
Let's go to the third one.

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:40.900
Faith in the fulfillment of Jehovah's promises moves us to want to go out and preach the good news of God's kingdom.

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:48.900
Now, let's read what the Scriptures say about this in 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and verse 13.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.900
It says there,

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:56.900
Now, because we have the same spirit of faith, as that of which it is written,

00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:06.900
I exercised faith, therefore I spoke, we too exercised faith, and therefore we speak.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.900
Well, what does it mean?

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:17.900
Without faith, without exercising faith in the promises of God, we would never, ever be able to do the preaching work.

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:24.900
In fact, maybe when you were first studying the Bible with Jehovah's Witnesses, maybe you said something like this.

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:27.900
I will never go from door to door.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:33.900
You will never see me walking down the street, knocking on doors, but what happened?

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:38.900
As you grew in your faith, you wanted to share the things that you were learning.

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:44.900
You wanted to talk about all the wonderful things that you were hearing about Jehovah.

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.900
Yes, faith helps us conquer our fears.

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:50.900
It helps us overcome shyness.

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:54.900
It helps us overcome indifference in the territory.

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:59.900
It helps us overcome opposition or even government bans.

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:10.900
Hitler, Stalin, the Soviet Union, and even Russia today, all of them have said that they would crush Jehovah's Witnesses

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:14.900
and they would put an end to our preaching.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:16.900
But what happened?

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:23.900
Our brothers and sisters kept on preaching, despite whatever opposition came.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:30.900
And our brothers today, living under similar circumstances under ban, continue preaching also.

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:34.900
They do not give up. Why?

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:39.900
Why are they able to keep going because of the power of faith?

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:49.900
Faith moves them to action and to continue telling the good news no matter what the circumstances may be.

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:52.900
Let's go on to the fourth point.

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:58.900
Our faith moves us to act in ways that bring blessings to us.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:00.900
Now, think about this.

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:07.900
Some people who saw and heard the teaching of Jesus and His works, they put faith in Him.

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:11.900
They believed that Jesus was able to heal them.

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:16.900
And so, that faith led to blessings, well in what way?

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:20.900
Well, sometimes when Jesus healed individuals, what did He say?

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:24.900
He said, your faith has made you well.

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:36.900
In other words, if those people had not exercised faith in Jesus, they would not have come to Him and they would never have experienced the healing that He gave them.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:39.900
What's the point?

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:45.900
Today, we are not looking to be physically healed through our faith in Jesus.

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:55.900
But many of us have made major decisions, made major changes in our lives in order to become disciples of Christ.

00:20:55.900 --> 00:21:04.900
Perhaps we left promising careers, perhaps we left fame, perhaps we gave up higher education or whatever it may be.

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:13.900
But what is the promise that Jesus made to all of us who have made these decisions based on faith?

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:18.900
In Mark chapter 10 and verse 29, look what Jesus said.

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:32.900
No one has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for my sake and for the sake of the good news.

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:53.900
Who will not get 100 times more now in this period of time, houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields with persecution and in the coming system of things, ever lasting life.

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:55.900
What's the point?

00:21:55.900 --> 00:22:07.900
You see, we've made these decisions. We may have walked away from many things in the world, but by putting faith in Christ Jesus, what amazing blessings have come to us.

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:16.900
Just like Jesus said, 100 times more than what we have given up. That is the power of faith.

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:19.900
Let's look at number five.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:28.900
Faith helps us to win our struggle against the superhuman spirit forces. Well now, how so?

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:41.400
Let's read together Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 16. Ephesians 6 and verse 16.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:55.400
It says, besides all of this, take up the large shield of faith, with which you will be able to extinguish all the wicked ones burning arrows.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:23:04.400
What is the point? Did you notice that here in Ephesians 6, faith is compared to a large shield.

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:17.400
Just like a large shield that covers most of the body, faith in Jehovah God and His promises for the future can shield us from, what does it say in verse 16?

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:27.400
From all the wicked ones burning arrows. We can be completely protected. Well, what does that mean?

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:38.400
It means that through our faith we have the power to get up and turn off that television. We have the power to walk out of that movie theater.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:51.400
We have the power to unplug that computer, if necessary, to get rid of those temptations or bad ideas that could motivate us to enter into a course of wrong.

00:23:51.400 --> 00:24:06.400
It is no wonder that first Thessalonians chapter 5 and verse 8 compares faith to a breastplate that can protect our figurative heart from temptation and from the power of sin.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:12.400
That is real power. But now let's go to our sixth point.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:25.400
Faith moves us to trust that our prayers to Jehovah God are heard and that Jehovah will answer them if they are in harmony with His will.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:33.400
This is what Jesus said. Will you read it with me? It's Mark chapter 11 and verse 24.

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:49.400
Jesus said, this is why I tell you all the things you pray and ask for have faith that you have received them and you will have them.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:25:17.400
Well now brothers, when we have that faith that the things we are asking Jehovah, He's hearing us. He's listening to us, especially during these troubled times in the midst of this pandemic, when we have many anxieties and concerns, how wonderful that we can believe that Jehovah God is hearing us and that He's going to provide an answer to us just exactly in harmony with what we need.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:39.400
So, after considering these six different factors, wouldn't you agree with me that faith is powerful? It has real power to make things that seem impossible to men become realities for those who have faith in Jehovah.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:55.400
Well, how thankful we can be that Jehovah is helping us to develop this wonderful quality through solid evidence, through accurate knowledge and through His precious Holy Spirit.

00:25:55.400 --> 00:26:07.400
Well, that brings us to that third question. How can we build up our faith and maybe more specifically, how is this convention going to help us to build our faith?

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:19.400
Well, of course, the convention is going to include many talks, symposiums, interviews, we're going to have a two-part Bible drama, so there is much to look forward to.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:32.400
But maybe just for a few minutes, would you open up your program, perhaps on your device like I'm using here today, and let's consider some of the highlights that we can expect to see in our convention.

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:41.400
So you'll notice on day one, the theme for the day is from Luke chapter 17 and verse 5, give us more faith.

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:56.400
Would you like to strengthen your relationship with Jehovah? Well, pay attention to the dramatic Bible reading. That's where we're going to learn about how faith moved Noah to be able to obey Jehovah.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:04.400
Even though the things Jehovah asked of him were very, very large, take notice of that audio drama.

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:24.400
And then in the afternoon, are you a person that loves Jehovah's creation? Well, the second symposium of our convention, use creation to build your faith, is going to show us how Jehovah's love, His wisdom and His power are reflected in all the beautiful things that He made.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:34.400
And it's going to show us also that Jehovah not only has the ability, but the desire to fulfill His promises for the future.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:48.400
And then how about this? How strong is your faith? Well, take notice of the final talk on Friday afternoon. That's where we're going to hear the talk, keep testing whether you are in the faith, how.

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:56.400
That will give us an opportunity to look at our own faith and see just how strong it is. Let's go to day two.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:04.400
There we see that the theme for the day is going to be Jude 3, put up a hard fight for the faith.

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:17.400
Have you begun to use our new study publication, Enjoy Life Forever? Well, we'll all want to listen carefully to the talk, Build Faith Using Enjoy Life Forever.

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:29.400
That's going to discuss how we can use this new study publication to reach the heart of our student, but also to help our student to build faith.

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:42.400
Within Jehovah's organization, we have many brothers and sisters who have unbelieving mates. We have many who are part of single parent families, and we have many who are single.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:54.400
The symposium entitled Fighters Successful Fighters for the Faith is going to show us what we can learn from these faithful Christians. Take note.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:29:04.400
And then looking in the afternoon, although we can't travel right now, we're going to have the opportunity to go on around the world tour.

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:16.400
Because the video how our brothers are showing faith is going to take us all around the world and show us how our brothers are manifesting faith in many, many different parts of this beautiful earth.

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:28.400
And then you are all in for an amazing treat with part one of the Bible drama, Daniel, a lifetime of faith.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:39.400
Now, I think I can say confidently that this is absolutely the best drama that we have ever produced. You are going to love it.

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:55.400
Well, the last talk on day two is a serious one. It's going to contrast faith destroyers with faith builders. And it's going to show us how we can strengthen our trust in Jehovah's Word and also in his organization.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:05.400
Well, finally day three, our theme is going to be Matthew 21, 21. If you have faith, it will happen.

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:23.400
We're going to look at what we can learn from faithful women of God. You'll notice there's an eight-part symposium that shows us how the women featured in each talk showed faith, but also how we can imitate their faith.

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:31.400
And then in the afternoon, we have the thrilling finale of that Bible drama, Daniel, a lifetime of faith.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:42.400
And finally, then, the convention will conclude all too soon with the very motivating and moving talk, become powerful by your faith.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:52.480
Well, brothers, would you like to see just a taste of what's in store and some of the videos we're going to be seeing? Let's watch.

00:30:52.480 --> 00:31:04.240
I could tell from the doctor's voice the news wasn't good. I just didn't expect my health to worsen so quickly.

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:09.240
If a gun is what I need to protect my family, won't Jehovah understand?

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:21.500
I knew how mom felt about the holidays, but I also learned how Jehovah felt.

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:31.000
It was as if a veil had been lifted from my eyes. That was the moment Jehovah introduced himself to me.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.000
In my darkest times, Jehovah's words brought me comfort.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:46.309
I knew these words would build my faith.

00:31:46.309 --> 00:31:53.740
Trust in Jehovah and do what is good.

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:57.740
Well, doesn't that wet your appetite for what is coming at this convention?

00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:05.740
Now, keep in mind, some of the videos at the convention present real accounts, but many others are just dramatizations.

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:17.740
Now, what does that mean? Well, the dramatizations don't portray real people or real events, but they depict situations that help to teach us the truth.

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:26.740
Jehovah God loves and appreciates men and women of faith, men and women just like you.

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:37.740
He is determined to reward men and women like that with an amazing reward. Would you read it with me? Let's look at John, chapter 6 and verse 40.

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:41.740
John, chapter 6 and verse 40, it says,

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:57.740
For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who recognizes the Son and exercises faith in Him should have ever lasting life, and I will resurrect Him on the last day.

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:04.740
Those exercising faith can be certain of receiving this reward.

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:07.740
John, chapter 3 verse 36, Jesus said,

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:15.740
The one who exercises faith in the Son has, has ever lasting life.

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:21.740
So, dear brothers and sisters, as we begin this wonderful convention,

00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:36.740
please be determined to take notes, be determined to meditate on the things that you will hear so that you may cultivate, maintain and strengthen your faith.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:47.740
If you do, you too will become powerful by faith and receive the wonderful amazing reward of ever lasting life.
