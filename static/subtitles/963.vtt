00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:06.980
There is a battle that has lasted for centuries and continues down to our day.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.980
It's a battle of wills.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.980
The will of disobedient humans who fight against Jehovah's will.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.980
Rather than submitting or surrendering their will to do Jehovah's will,

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.980
most humans refuse to make peace with him, becoming peace-breakers.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.980
On the other hand, millions throughout the centuries have humbly submitted to Jehovah's will,

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:37.979
making his will their will, they are known as peace-makers.

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:44.979
By sewing peace with Jehovah, they have reaped the benefits of having a close personal friendship with him,

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:49.979
and the wonderful hope of living forever in a peaceful new world.

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:57.979
Even so, we must admit, it can be difficult at times to accept and then follow Jehovah's direction,

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:01.979
or direction that we may receive from his organization,

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:09.980
especially if we don't understand the reasons behind the direction, or it's not what we might prefer.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.980
What is needed to sew and reap peace?

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.980
Humility.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.980
Humility is defined as a lowliness of mind, freedom from pride or arrogance.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:30.980
A humble person is not self-willed, but they actively look for ways to sew peace with Jehovah and others.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.980
He's known as a peacemaker.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.980
What is the result of humility and sewing peace?

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.980
Notice what Proverbs 22 in verse 4 says.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:52.980
The result of humility and the fear of Jehovah is reaping, notice, riches and glory and life.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.980
Yes, everlasting life.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:04.980
The Bible contains many fine examples of those who sewed and reaped peace by humbly submitting to Jehovah's will.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.980
Let's consider the example of the Gibbianites.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.979
The Gibbianites weren't the enemies of the Israelites?

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:13.979
Yes.

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:19.979
So how did they humbly sew and reap peace with Jehovah and with his people?

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:25.979
As you recall, after Joshua led the Israelites across the Jordan River into the Promised Land,

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:30.979
Jehovah directed them to remove the pagan Canaanite nations who dwelt there.

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:34.979
This included the Gibbianites.

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:45.979
The account that Joshua 9 informs us that the Gibbianites were plainly told that it was Jehovah's will that the Canaanites be annihilated.

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:53.979
Israel's stunning victories over Jericho and AI made it very clear that Jehovah was fighting for his people.

00:02:53.979 --> 00:03:01.979
And the Gibbianites did not want to be next, but what could they do if this was Jehovah's will?

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:04.979
Well, they devised an interesting plan.

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:10.979
They sent representatives to seek peace with the Israelites and thereby with Jehovah.

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:13.979
According to verse 11, they were instructed,

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:18.419
we will be your servants.

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:21.419
Now, make a covenant with us.

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:24.419
So this is what they were to say as representatives.

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:32.419
Verse 4 says that the Gibbianites acted shrewdly by trying to trick the Israelites with their worn out clothing and provisions.

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:40.419
Pretending that they had traveled from a very distant land, but were actually just 20 miles away.

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:42.419
Did their plan work?

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:47.419
Despite their deception, yes, their plan was successful.

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:53.419
In fact, in verse 15, Joshua made a covenant of peace with the Gibbianites.

00:03:53.419 --> 00:04:01.419
Evidently, this was in harmony with Jehovah's will and reflected their humility and desire to seek peace with him

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:03.419
and his people.

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:09.419
They demonstrated their humility and submission to Jehovah's will and his representative, Joshua,

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:13.419
by following whatever direction they received.

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:16.420
In fact, notice the direction in verse 27.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:26.420
Says, Joshua made them gatherers of wood and drawers of water for the assembly and for Jehovah's altar.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:37.420
Although the Gibbianite men were likely skilled warriors, they were happy and content to do whatever work they were given to support pure worship.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:44.420
Humbly following direction saved their lives and brought them peace.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:52.420
How can we imitate the Gibbianites by bringing our lives into harmony with Jehovah's will?

00:04:52.420 --> 00:05:02.420
For some, this may require making big changes, adjusting their thinking, giving up harmful practices and avoiding bad associates.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:12.420
We can also imitate the Gibbianites by being willing to perform whatever assignments we are given, humbly to support pure worship.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.420
So the lesson is clear.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:20.420
Sewing and reaping peace requires humbly following direction.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:24.420
This lesson is highlighted in the following dramatization.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:35.740
Notice the benefits of submitting to Jehovah's direction.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:41.740
You see, pandemic lasted longer than any of us expected.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:48.089
And all the conflicting news reports just added to the stress.

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:52.089
Then my sister lost her job and had to move in with us.

00:05:52.089 --> 00:06:00.399
So yeah, it was me and Kelly, Nicole, and Dad.

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:05.399
Twenty seconds, son. Twenty seconds.

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:17.800
Where's your mask?

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.800
Don't worry.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.800
Here, you can use this one.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.800
I won't get near anyone.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.800
Gary!

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.800
Listen, nobody at the warehouse is wearing masks.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.800
And do you know how many people have actually gotten sick?

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.800
Zero.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.800
So far.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.800
You saw the last governing body update.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.800
We can't let down our guard.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.800
Not now.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.800
Dad, I get it, okay?

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:49.370
Look, I think it's great that the brothers are trying to keep us safe.

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:50.370
But...

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.370
But what?

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:57.370
Don't you think that they're, you know, overreacting?

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:16.439
But of course, it wasn't the brothers who had the problem.

00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:23.850
It was me.

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:31.220
A week later, I found out that a friend in our service group was in the hospital with COVID-19.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.220
He was young.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.220
And he'd been taking all the rape precautions.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.980
I had really let my guard down.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:51.899
Oh, it's not the time to slacken our hand when it comes to safety.

00:07:51.899 --> 00:07:54.899
Don't let your guard down.

00:07:54.899 --> 00:07:58.899
Don't think the virus can't affect you or your family.

00:07:58.899 --> 00:08:05.220
I saw how the organization was really trying to protect us.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:13.259
And how much my decisions were affecting others, including the people I love the most.

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:27.620
As the pandemic dragged on, I learned the importance of being humble and obedient.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:35.370
Following Jehovah's direction didn't just help us stay safe.

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:43.669
It brought us peace.

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:48.669
What timely lessons, especially with all that we are facing today.

00:08:48.669 --> 00:08:53.669
Like Gary, there are times that we may need to adjust our thinking on matters

00:08:53.669 --> 00:09:01.669
and put aside our personal opinions and preferences so we can loyally and humbly follow Jehovah's direction.

00:09:01.669 --> 00:09:08.669
Or whatever direction we receive from his representatives, the faithful and discreet slave.

00:09:08.669 --> 00:09:11.669
Gary learned an important lesson.

00:09:11.669 --> 00:09:16.669
Humbly following direction doesn't just help our family stay safe.

00:09:16.669 --> 00:09:19.669
It brings us happiness and peace.

00:09:19.669 --> 00:09:23.669
A vital lesson for us today.

00:09:23.669 --> 00:09:28.669
What can help us to humbly follow direction now, as well as in the future?

00:09:28.669 --> 00:09:35.669
Note what the Apostle Paul said at Ephesians chapter 5 and verse 17.

00:09:35.669 --> 00:09:45.669
He says, stop being unreasonable, but keep perceiving what the will of Jehovah is.

00:09:45.669 --> 00:09:49.669
The Bible clearly shows God's thinking on matters.

00:09:49.669 --> 00:09:52.669
But what if it's not so clear to us?

00:09:52.669 --> 00:09:59.669
Or we struggle to fully grasp how it applies to us personally or in a given situation?

00:09:59.669 --> 00:10:01.669
What did Paul advise?

00:10:01.669 --> 00:10:06.669
To keep perceiving what the will of Jehovah is.

00:10:06.669 --> 00:10:08.669
How can we do that?

00:10:08.669 --> 00:10:13.669
Just as a minor keeps digging deep below the surface of the ground to find precious gems,

00:10:13.669 --> 00:10:18.669
we must look beyond the surface of what we read in the Bible.

00:10:18.669 --> 00:10:26.669
This requires that we keep digging deep, carefully searching for gems in the form of Bible principles.

00:10:26.669 --> 00:10:31.669
Then, we must prayerfully meditate on what we find.

00:10:31.669 --> 00:10:37.669
Then, Jehovah's precious thoughts will become our thoughts.

00:10:37.669 --> 00:10:43.669
Perceiving Jehovah's thinking on matters will help us to avoid getting into a battle of wills,

00:10:43.669 --> 00:10:50.669
so we can follow his direction or whatever direction we receive from the governing body.

00:10:50.669 --> 00:10:58.669
Like the Gibbianites, may we be peacemakers by continuing to sow peace with Jehovah and his people.

00:10:58.669 --> 00:11:06.669
As we humbly make Jehovah's will, our will, we will joyfully reap abundant peace forever.

00:11:06.669 --> 00:11:12.669
Brother Kenneth Flodin, a helper to the teaching committee, will now consider the next talk of the symposium.

00:11:12.669 --> 00:11:15.669
How they sowed and reap peace?

00:11:15.669 --> 00:11:16.669
Gideon.
