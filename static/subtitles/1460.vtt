When young ones see brothers and sisters enjoying their sacred service,

00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:11.419
they'll often express their faith and talk about future spiritual goals.

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:16.420
We went along with several groups of children to find out why they visited Bethel

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.420
and what that visit taught them about the organization, Angiahova.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:29.589
It took me three hours and forty-eight minutes.

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:33.590
It took us two and a half to three hours to get here.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.590
I would rather go to Bethel than sit down and watch TV on my sofa.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.590
I'd rather go to Bethel just like Caleb and Sophia.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:01:25.489
I really, really wanted to go after that.

00:01:25.489 --> 00:01:33.489
Because we haven't been here for a long time, it's a great experience and it's nice to see what they're doing here.

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:41.870
You can find people who serve Jehovah and they're happy.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.870
And you can feel their concern for other people.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:55.700
I was off school, we got to go to Bethel and we really glad that we got to go.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:05.659
I like the translation department because that is where our publications and videos are translated into different languages.

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:17.659
I saw the mini truck drivers at Bethel and then we got to see how they make the books and bibles.

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:24.659
I learned the paper in those barrels that they actually stretch from here to France.

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:30.659
I saw it when the paper was going down the machine that rolls the paper.

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:38.659
A little cart came onto the wheel and then the thing pulled the paper down and then the paper rolled inside.

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:44.659
And then it went and then the cart had the paper inside and it rolled away.

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:47.659
If you go to other places, they are dirty.

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:51.659
But here it is because this is the Jehovah's house.

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:54.659
I really like the laundry.

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:58.659
I saw these really big machines that keep on twirling.

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:01.659
Then clean clothes come out.

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:05.659
Then they put more clothes into another machine.

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:07.659
It twels and twels and it dries.

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:09.659
I also like the iron.

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.659
You just put the clothes there and there it's a ready dry.

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:20.659
On our tour we made the news for friends.

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:23.659
We had an amazing tour guide.

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:28.659
He was good because he told us more about Jehovah.

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:40.539
I think that Bethel is really good and it helps the people so much learning to hover.

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:43.539
To other kids who haven't toured Bethel yet,

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:48.539
they should try to come and visit because they won't only enjoy the experience,

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:53.539
they also learn many things about Jehovah's organization.

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:58.270
I would tell kids that it didn't want to come to Bethel,

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:05.270
that they're mixing out on something that is so great in loving from Jehovah.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.270
It showed me that Jehovah is a loving and caring God.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:35.209
Over for Bethel.

00:04:35.209 --> 00:04:42.209
If your circumstances allow, we're sure your family will benefit spiritually from visiting Bethel.

00:04:42.209 --> 00:04:47.209
It warms our hearts during these visits to see children who love Jehovah

00:04:47.209 --> 00:04:52.209
and show an appreciation for spiritual things at such a young age.
