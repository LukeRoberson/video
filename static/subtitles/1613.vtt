00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:21.079
Shortly after getting baptized, I set the goal of becoming a regular pioneer.

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:28.850
Then I went to preach in an unassigned territory where mosquito is spoken.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:34.140
After that, I started serving as a special pioneer.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.939
And sometime later I went to the school for kingdom evangelizers.

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:43.020
Sometime ago, I began to suffer from kidney failure.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.020
So it felt like I wasn't doing anything anymore.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.820
And I couldn't go back in time.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.259
I grew up in a Christian family.

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:57.500
My dad worked in the construction of the Bethel branch and then served as a Bethelife for

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.939
some time.

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:04.099
My mom was a regular pioneer when she was younger.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:10.329
She also volunteered at Bethel, and that's how she met my dad.

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:15.969
Some years ago, I started suffering from severe anxiety attacks, and that really affected

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:18.609
me in the congregation.

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:24.890
I started to compare myself to others, and I did the same with my parents.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.849
I felt I could never live up to their example.

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:38.689
I grew up in a family where I wasn't made to feel I never really felt adequate.

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:44.510
I felt so worthless, I felt very alone.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:51.359
When my health problems began, I started comparing myself.

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:56.879
I began thinking about what I was able to do before and about how my activity had gone

00:01:56.879 --> 00:02:00.000
down.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.640
This watched our study help me to see how some previous assignments would help me to do

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:14.479
things better in my current assignment that helped me to think about what I can do now.

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:20.580
I think this watched our article came just at the right time.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.620
I've learned that I compared myself to others is very damaging, and it was bringing me

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.150
down spiritually.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.469
So now that I've set the goal to stop doing that, I've seen good results.

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:41.699
I've had the chance to make good friends with older brothers and sisters in the congregation,

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:48.819
and when some of them needed help and turned to me, I was happy to help them, and that encouraged

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.580
me a lot.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:58.139
When I started going to the meetings, I was somewhat afraid I was going to be inadequate

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:04.219
to the congregation.

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:11.419
Faircraft 20 of this watched our study helps me understand that I should use the gifts

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:21.240
that the congregation and especially Jehovah helped me to discover, to encourage the congregation.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:30.960
For example, having raised two children alone as a young single mother, being able to do that,

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.800
I could help others in the congregation who are going through the same experience.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:43.500
I've set concrete goals for myself, like helping to clean the kingdom hall.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.699
Although it's lighter work, it's helped me tremendously.

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:53.340
It gives me a lot of joy to know that it's for Jehovah.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:00.099
Now I try to help out the congregation wherever I can, speaking to an audience might not be

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:09.229
easy for me, but Jehovah has helped me to carry out my assignments, and that has helped

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:14.500
me to realize my place in Jehovah's congregation.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:21.779
This has helped a lot in developing myself a steam, not to dwell on the past, on the old

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:29.180
feelings of inadequacy or dwell on the perfection that I used to demand from myself.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.939
I discovered I have something good to give to the congregation.

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:40.649
The brothers need the good deeds that we're able to do.

00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:48.420
It gives me a lot of joy to see that I can help others overcome their trials.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.620
And this really helps me understand that I do have a role in the congregation.
