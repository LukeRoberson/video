00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:10.910
The biggest challenge for me and my family has been illness, not having enough money to

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.550
pay for the treatment we need.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:24.070
Each week I have to save up enough money just to feed my family.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.230
We were deeply saddened by our situation.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:37.149
First, it was a challenge for us to make ends meet because I didn't have a regular job.

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.710
I also worried about how my children would suffer if we did not have sufficient food and other

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:51.390
material needs.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.310
I began to think that moving to another country was the only way to provide for my family.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:10.010
As first Timothy 5.8 says, it is my responsibility to support them.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.129
What kept me from moving to another country is my love for Jehovah and for my family.

00:01:15.129 --> 00:01:19.650
As Philippians 1.10 says, we should make sure of the more important things.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:32.540
And for my family, our spirituality is very important.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.530
The final advice of Annalda Strinth and me.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:48.870
He asked, does Jehovah only share our blessings abroad?

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.590
I remember what he said.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.950
From then on, I realized that the most important thing in life is our spirituality.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:10.530
Not the material things that we can get from this world, for it will also vanish.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:17.610
A great blessing has been keeping our family united and happy despite our difficult situation.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.090
I serve as a ministerial servant and auxiliary pioneer.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:29.699
My daughter Fatima is a regular pioneer without a doubt Jehovah blesses our efforts.

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:31.500
Giving makes me happy.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.740
Other brothers and sisters go through times of need just as we do.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.979
Thinking of this helps me not to focus on my problems, but rather on our brotherhood

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:39.979
and Jehovah.

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:50.099
I am deeply convinced that we made the right decision as a family.

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:59.979
And now we are very happy despite having little material because I feel content.

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:04.580
They say, if you are content, you are rich and the scripture says,

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.580
it is Jehovah that makes one rich and he adds no pain with it.
